"The story of Micky ""Irish"" Ward and his boxing career with his crack addicted brother at his side. Apparently Marky Mark was so hell bent on getting this film made that he stayed in ""shape"" for years and years just in case the film went into production. That's dedication and passion for you, yet the man still manages to be the weak link. It's not really his fault, David O. Russell packed the film with a lot of talent. Christian Bale plays Dicky Ecklund, Micky's crack addicted brother who tells the same story over and over again, about him knocking out Sugar Ray Leonard. It's his claim to fame. There is a film crew following him around, he thinks it's going to be about his comeback, yet it's really about the harsh realities of crack addiction. Bale, again, submerses himself in the role. He is pure method. You can not like him as a person, or even an actor, but you can't deny his passion for the art. He is on the thin side again, with thin balding hair and brown teeth. He looks deathly ill in every scene. The man has one of his finest roles to date and will no doubt be nominated come award season. I hope he actually takes home the award. He is without a doubt, the most interesting character in the film. Their mother is played by Melissa Leo, another performance worthy of recognition come award season. Her desire to see her kids rise to fame blind her from the truth. She denies the drugs and the failures and believes she knows what's best for her kids. This means not letting them get a real chance because it would be with a real manager and she would be left behind. Family is important to her and she wants to keep everyone very close, even if it harms their chance at making a name for themselves. She of course, doesn't realize this. Amy Adams is the love interest, you know there had to be one. She manages to pull Micky away from the family that is dragging him down. They don't like her for it. She has her own inspirations too, yet the story isn't interested in them. The main focus of the film is with Micky's bumpy road to the championship fight. Since this is based on a true story, I can't really fault it for becoming a bit formulaic and predictable, yet it is. David O. Russell is notorious for getting angry and violent with his crew/cast. He was in a physical fight with George Clooney on the set of Three Kings and anyone can go on youtube and check out the melt down he and Lily Tomlin had on the set of I Heart Huckabees. Both films coincidentally star Mark Walhberg, so it seems he doesn't have a problem working with the combative director. I can't deny that the man has talent. I really love Three Kings and found I Heart Huckabees to be an ambitious project for the sheer weirdness of it all. With The Fighter, he plays to a more conventional audience. In terms of boxing films, it works. It plays on the down and out character, the poverty of his life and the sheer determination he has to make a name for himself. It's no Rocky, or as others have mentioned Raging Bull, but it is good enough to be mentioned with them.Russell always has an eye for a creative shot. Check out Three Kings colour scheme for what I mean. Here he uses TV cameras for the boxing matches. Interesting move, it feels like we are watching it at home and are not really in the ring with them. I admire directors who think outside of the box. Russell does this, no problem. He also decides to include real footage of the characters. The film has some home video segments throughout and during the credits we get to meet the real Micky Ward and Dicky Eckland, which is even more reason to appreciate Bale's performance. The film trips a bit because of the lack of emotion from Walhberg. I dig the guy and enjoy his films, but his range isn't there yet. When given a role that he can play the absurdity of, he scores. Watch The Departed for that. For a film where the audience needs to get behind a character, to root and cheer for them to overcome their obstacles, he falls a little short. Thank goodness the film makes up for this with the performances from Bale and Leo.The Fighter features great music, engaging performances and a predictable, yet true story. I felt attached to the characters and hoping they would make smart decisions. If a film can get me to care about the characters, I say bravo. The Fighter is a winner in my books."
"In many ways, ""The Fighter"" is the film of 2011. A family drama with a pugilistic background. The punches, physical and emotional in and out of the ring took me completely by surprise. What didn't surprise me was Mark Wahlberg's signature all over the place. Let me explain: Many years ago I was at a lecture by director Martin Donovan when during the Q&A somebody made fun of the fact that Calvin Klein underwear model Marky Mark had played a part (his first acting role) in Donovan's made for TV ""The Substitute"" Donovan with elegance, wit and firmness destroyed the guy asking the question, describing Wahlberg's strengths and ended up saying ""Mark Wahlberg will be one of the top actors around and he will probably be running Hollywood within a decade"" I had Donovan's words buzzing in my ears when I sat speechless watching ""Boogie Nights"". Wahlberg also produced ""Entourage"" and the startling ""In Treatment"". He now produced ""The Fighter"" and his performance, interior and powerful, dominates the film allowing other members of the cast, to shine in truly showy roles, Christian Bale for instance - really good. Melissa Leo is a stand out as the mother/manager. Superb. So I won't be surprised to see Mark Wahlberg receiving the top honors at the next Academy Awards, as an actor and producer. He certainly deserves it. Bravo!"
"Does David O. Russell's 'The Fighter' follow the formula of underdog surpassing all obstacles and winning in the end (as is the case with this genre)? The answer is yes but 'The Fighter' still manages to maintain a unique quality. First of all, the four principle characters: Micky, Dicky, Charlene and Alice are unlike anyone one has seen in this kind of film.They are wonderfully defined and the actors who portray them are cast against type and turn in their finest performance. Both Melissa Leo and Amy Adams are like you've never seen them before and they appear very natural on screen. Mark Wahlberg is superly restrained and Christian Bale does one of his best works of his entire career. They are supported by a host of impressive actors.In addition to the marvelous performances, the makeup department has done a remarkable job, especially by making Leo look old enough to play Bale and Wahlberg's mother. Bale actually does look years older than Wahlberg (when in reality he's a year younger) and that just adds more to the authenticity.From the opening sequence, I was under the impression that 'The Fighter' was going to be a documentary-type movie but O. Russell tricks and surprises the audience with that. His execution is subtle unlike the loud approach which other directors commonly follow.For me 'The Fighter', is more about the human connection than the sports itself. Boxing is clearly a metaphor as is the title which has multiple meanings. Even though he's been constantly let down by his family, Micky chose to give them a second chance and have them by his side. Even though Charlene disapproves Alice and Dicky's involvement in Micky's career, Dicky attempts to persuade her because he knows that Micky won't stand a chance without her by his side. Even though Alice and Charlene don't see eye to eye, there's a silent acceptance between them as they know that Micky needs them both.I am really beginning to have more respect for Mark Wahlberg for producing gems like this (in addition to some amazing TV-series like 'In Treatment', 'Boardwalk Empire' and 'Entourage') and his growth as an actor is obviously apparent (he just needs to avoid tripe like 'The Happening' at all costs).'The Fighter' is a winner on various levels."
"When it comes to winning awards, boxing films seem to always be contenders; as such, the thought of watching ""another boxing film"" can be off-putting. But ""The Fighter"" hangs in and fends off those labels, earning every bit of its critical praise. That's because most of the fighting in this film takes place out of the ring; ""Irish"" Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) spars with the troublesome brother who trains him and his mother who manages him and these superb supporting characters have their own challengers to overcome.David O. Russell brings a needed dose of realism to the boxing genre, downplaying the underdog nature of Micky's true story and focusing on the relationships that push him through and hold him back all throughout his journey toward the welterweight title. Much of the time, in fact, the story feels equally Micky's and his brother's. Dickie Eklund (Christian Bale), as beat over our heads early in the film, went ten rounds with Sugar Ray Leonard and knocked him down, becoming the pride of small working-class town Lowell, Mass. â€” which as one might imagine, wasn't hard.But Dickie, an off-kilter, fun-loving yet irresponsible guy (a transformative performance from Bale to say the least), spends the time he's not training Micky in crack houses. In fact, he's completely oblivious to the fact that HBO is following him around for their documentary on crack abuse, not one about his ""comeback."" It's clear that his behavior is keeping Micky, whose had a string of bad losses of late, down. After an embarrassing fight in which Micky was mismatched, Micky suddenly finds himself wondering whether he should keep his boxing career and family separate.The idea of it irritates Micky's mother Alice, played by Melissa Leo, who impressively embodies every controlling mother. Alice sits in her house most days and smokes cigarettes while her seven grown daughters pathetically vie for her attention. Leo keeps Alice from being an aggravating total monster, providing a more complete picture of a mother whose blurred the line between business and family.Amy Adams also excels in her supporting role, a bartender and college dropout, but one who â€” like the audience â€” sees how Micky's family has kept him back and as his girlfriend pushes him toward the right path. Interestingly, as she grows more invested in Micky's career, the script divides her from the audience, which gives her performance more weight.Russell's characters have a harsh reality to them, much like the Boston-based characters in Ben Affleck's films ""Gone Baby Gone"" and ""The Town."" In addition to looks, clothes and mannerisms, Russell chooses a more hand-held documentary feel for the film like Darren Aronofsky's ""The Wrestler"" and even opts to film parts of the boxing sequences with lenses like the ones used in the late '90s to give the feel of watching a live broadcast.The fights, though effective, remain secondary to the other ""fighting."" Watching Dickie spiral downward and come back up again, Alice have trouble letting go and Micky struggle to speak up for himself and recognize what he truly needs serves as the more compelling conflict. All together, they give ""The Fighter"" the best ensemble cast of 2010. And like all great boxing films, all these tensions blow in and out make their way symbolically into the boxing ring for that final fight. As Dickie urges on his brother in the waning rounds of the championship fight, he captures it perfectly when he says ""everything that's happened, take that out there with you.""The emotional moments of ""The Fighter"" do lack a real knockout and many intimate moments are tempered with humor in awkward but not scene-ruining ways, but rather than be a heavyweight drama that rides the underdog story for two hours, ""The Fighter"" opts to be something a bit more natural by fixing on the right things: the people and the personal relationships that hurt or harm us, are all essential to our success.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"
"After Rocky, Raging Bull, Ali, Million Dollar Baby, Cinderella man, and many others, one begins to wonder how many more boxing movies we really need in the world, and what a new one can bring to the table. Indeed, watching The Fighter, one can't help but wonder what the film can do to renew the genre and bring something new to the table. Unfortunately, the answer is ""nothing much"". The script is a pretty conventional rags-to-riches story, whose most interesting element is the relationship between Micky Ward and his brother, Dickie Eklund. Luckily, Russell and company recognized that this was the strongest aspect of what is otherwise a good but ordinary and somewhat flawed script, with some problems with flat characterizations and unnatural-sounding dialogue. However, everyone involved in the film tries their best to transcend the script, and for the most part, they succeed.Russell's direction is absolutely fantastic. His use of the camera â€“ which still has that indie looseness, free-moving and hand-held and gritty quality to it, which really adds to the atmosphere and energy the film tries to capture. His staging of scenes is fantastic and he usually just lets his actors riff off of one another, sometimes sticking to the script but sometimes talking over one another, interrupting, and creating a very dynamic back-and- forth that further lends to the realistic quality of the film and its setting. A fantastic rock- oriented soundtrack only adds to this energy and atmosphere. In terms of bringing something new to the table of boxing movies, Russell employs a very interesting technique of filming the boxing scenes as they were shown on HBO pay-per-view TV in the 90's; cheap video quality, multi-camera set-ups, the whole package. The boxing scenes were all shot over 3 days, which left the crew just enough time to run through one boxing match at a time and just shooting it as if it were an actual match, the cameras capturing everything, including mistakes and mess-ups and spontaneous, uncontrolled occurrences which yet again add to the very loose and realistic style the film attempts to capture. It is a very interesting and unique technique I have not seen used before, and I thought it was a fresh approach to boxing scenes, which have become very conventional ever since Raging Bull.Ultimately, though, this is a movie about two brothers and their overcoming demons and obstacles in order to succeed and reach their mutual goal, together. Being a character-based film, the success of the acting is a key to the success of the film, and luckily, it is in this field that the film succeeds the most. Mark Wahlberg is adequate in the lead role of Micky Ward. I have never thought much of him as an actor and think that he did an ""okay"" job on this film; not bad but not particularly noteworthy. However, his supporting cast all shine, and his chemistry with them, especially with Christian Bale, is really what sells the movie for me. Bale's achievement is nothing short of revolutionary. He completely steals the show as Micky's crack-addicted older brother and trainer, a former boxer himself, and a shadow of his old self, except he can still throw one hell of a punch and knows just what Micky needs to do in order to succeed. Bale completely embodies the role and really gives it his all â€“ both in his appearance (hollow cheeks, bulgy eyes, balding) but also in his bravura performance. It is an incredible feat of acting, one of the best I have seen all year; Bale's best work as an actor yet, and totally deserving of all the accolades it will inevitably receive. Also worth mentioning though are the two main female supporting roles, namely Amy Adams as the tough and sassy but supportive girlfriend, and Melissa Leo as the overbearing mother. Both actresses are very much out of their comfort zone, which is just what makes their performances so good. Adams, who has never really shown her tough side like she does in this film, does a spectacular job, and really creates someone human and relatable out of what is otherwise an underwritten character. The same goes for Melissa Leo: her character could have gone the completely one-dimensional villainous way, but Leo adds a certain humanity to the character which just makes her seem more sad than vicious.Ultimately, The Fighter tells a pretty conventional story in an interesting and not necessarily conventional way. It is a film that could have been over-dramatized and heavy-handed had it been put in another director's hands (see Cinderella Man for an example of over- dramatization), but Russell and his cast reign it in and set out to create a very specific atmosphere and set a particular mood that lends the film a sense of realism and a very unique dynamic energy that, with the help of the fantastic performances from the cast, help carry it above and beyond its conventional script."
"This a great American family drama movie. Shows the ups and downs of a big crazy family with 2 boxers in the family. The big ''legend'' Bale and his young brother Wahlberg. This story is about how the younger brother who looks up to his crack addicted older ''legend' brother for guidance and advice, has to turn away from him and his toxic family to succeed in his boxing career. It shows the struggles of a young fighter as he attempts to turn his life around after always living in the shadows of his brother. How he faces dilemma's when confronted with his family and newfound love interest (amy adams) about what is good for his career. Walhberg does a good job with his role but the supporting cast take the cake. Bale, Melissa Leo and Adams all acted incredibly and are worthy of the awards. This just shows how well acted this whole film is."
"Do we have a lot of sport films where the underdog ends up winning and overcoming many obstacles along the way until the end? Definitely. Does The Fighter succeed? Very much so...For a film like this it is very difficult to make it completely unpredictable, yet while The Fighter is in a way conventional, it is also unpredictable many times. It has great characters to boot, but also a strong cast that is willing to give it their all. This is the best ensemble cast of the year,, many amazing performances. First, I start off with Mark Wahlberg, who has been the most under the radar, but he is definitely up for this. He is a great lead and I am surprised he was as good as he was. I am also very pleasantly surprised by Amy Adams. Not to say she is a bad actress, but I was always used to her roles all being similar and now she is in a completely different role for her, and to say she succeeds is an understatement. She is excellent, and is only made strong when sharing the screen with any other actor. Melissa Leo is also great, and I think she is on par with Adams. The difference between Adams and Leo is that Leo has the more award-baity role. Now we have Christian Bale, who I do think is the best. I have seen his performances and while he has always been good, he has never truly risen above others in his films, here he does. He is excellent, and he as of now deserves that Oscar.David Russel's direction is part of what makes this film so great, He soars scenes to unbelievable heights and I think that the screenplay in another director's hands would have came out with a merely good film. But here, we have an excellent film, perhaps better than 2008's The Wrestler, and one of the best films of the year."
"""O the joy of the strong-brawn'd fighter, towering in the arena in perfect condition, conscious of power, thirsting to meet his opponent."" Walt WhitmanMark Wahlberg has achieved a career high with The Fighter, not so much for his acting, which is eclipsed by a supportive cast that would be hard to beat in the Oscar race, but because he fought for years to bring the story of Lowell, Mass. to the screen. He caught perfectly the blue-collar town's karma and their devotion to the fighting brothers, ""Irish"" Mickey Ward (Wahlberg) and Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale).Director David O. Russell has assembled this cast around the idea that a town in the shadow of Boston can become world famous as its sons become winners in the ring. But then, Stallone did more for Philadelphia as Rocky, so what's the big deal? Like Ben Affleck's excellent thriller this year about Boston in The Town, Fighter captures place and struggle in equal dramatic measure as filmmakers take a close look at the working class's struggles over the last 30 years. While Million Dollar Baby (2004) focused on trainer and fighter and Cinderella Man (2005) gave a microscopic view of a troubled fighter and his small family, The Fighter does all of that with a vigor as exhausting as a bout itself.The Fighter is not just about boxing because as in Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull (1980), it's all about people who find in the sport a way to transcend their social prison. In The Fighter, it is more even about family, which weighs heavily on Micky's success or failure. And outside family as well, for girlfriend, bartender Charlene Fleming (Amy Adams), is a formidable force in liberating Micky from the suffocating family (his five harpy sisters and domineering manager mother, Melissa Leo, fearsome in her cigarette smoke and driving vision for her sons). Unlike other boxing films, Fighter is patient with Micky's long climb to success, almost painfully long but rewarding in the reality of its prolonged struggle. But it's also the acting that distinguishes it: Christian Bale as Dicky transforms himself again by losing weight and morphing into a manic brother who loves Micky despite Dicky's negative life of drugs and mania; Amy Adams is believable as the gritty but beautiful girl friend; and Melissa Leo plays mom like a lady Macbeth in tight Dockers.Although there will be heavier films competing for 2010's Oscar, I can't think of another whose cast so eloquently has caught the poverty and riches of a town caught in boxing fever."
"Look, i like the film, I think it's awesome but I also think were the characters were played by less effective actors, this wouldn't be as awesome as it is. The biggest fault for me, is that the main character has less personality than most sports characters in sport films. Mickey Ward (Mark Wahlberg) has a crackhead brother, former boxing great played flawlessly by Christian Bale, and he has manager-mom played by brilliant Melissa Leo. Mark Wahlberg has range, he is a good actor, but Mickey just fell flat for me. I wasn't invested much in Mickey so when the boxing matches came on, I didn't care much. But the performances by the backup cast are fantastic. If anything, that's worth the concession price."
"Such a fully satisfying film is a rarity. A story of family, struggle, and love told with great humor, intelligence and heart. I've already seen it twice and am telling everyone I meet to be sure to catch it. I was blown away by Amy Adams' touching performance in JUNE BUG and by the raw beauty of Melissa Leo's work in FROZEN RIVER, but have been slow to distinguish among the crop of young male stars and directors who deserve to be household names. Christian BALE, MARK WAHLBERG, and David O. RUSSELL are names now branded in my consciousness. This season I've been stunned by the creative forces at work in films including SOCIAL NETWORK and JACK GOES BOATING, but for its overall achievement, this amazing film based on the true story of two boxers from Lowell, Massachusetts earns a championship. It is much more than just a fight film or a biopic though it certainly sweeps us into the drama of the boxing ring and quivers with the diamond gleam of truth. Bale's finely etched creation of Dicky and Wahlberg's extraordinary dual turn as producer and star in the role of Dicky's brother Micky should place both men front and center for Oscar nominations along with Russell who shaped the film with a keen sensitivity. Russel's team of artists including cinematographer, costume and sound design were all spot on in their respective contributions. Tho Leo and her gaggle of daughters struck me at first as verging on caricature, I quickly saw that they perfectly captured the family culture while providing a delicious comic motif."
"Greetings again from the darkness. Don't let the hype or the fear of just another ""boxing"" movie keep you from this one. Yes, it is based on the true story of ""Irish"" Micky Ward, a boxer from Lowell, Massachusetts, but this is every bit as much a story of family and commitment and tenacity as any story you know.Directed by David O Russell (I Heart Huckabees), the film does a terrific job of dumping us right smack into this blue collar community and this oh-so-colorful family. Mark Wahlberg stars as Micky Ward, the younger brother of former boxer Dicky Ecklund (a no-holds-barred Christian Bale). Ecklund lived for years off his fight against Sugar Ray Leonard, where Leonard either was knocked down or slipped down. Either way, Dicky is as close to a local legend as it gets. In the mid-80's, younger brother Micky joined the fight game - with Dicky as his trainer and his mother (Melissa Leo) as his manager.As realistic and believable as the boxing is in the film, the real trick was in presenting Micky's family. The first impression of his mother and gaggle of sisters is that it's a cartoonish presentation. In fact, it's very realistic! When local bartender Charlene (Amy Adams)becomes involved with Micky, she tries to set him straight on exactly what his family is doing to his career.Oh, did I mention that Dicky was a crackhead? Did I mention that his mother pushed him into fights against upper weight classes because she needed the money? Did I mention that Micky tries to remain loyal to the family ... even to the extent of nearly costing him a shot at a legitimate career? There are some real emotions going on all over this well-paced film. Thanks to the Amy Adams character, we really get to see how an ""outsider"" views the family, and vice versa. It's not a pretty sight! I can't say enough about Bale's performance as Dicky. He has the movement and gait of both a boxer and a crackhead. His mannerisms mirror that of the real Dicky, as seen over the ending credits. This is crazy good acting. Melissa Leo is fast becoming the hardest working actress in Hollywood. This is the third film I have seen her in this year! Her performance, when combined with Jacki Weaver in Animal Kingdom, really create some nightmares for kids with creepy mothers! Amy Adams is totally convincing as the pretty, tough love interest and guiding light for Micky. As for Wahlberg, he is quite convincing as a boxer. His physicality is without question. The only thing I didn't like was the couple of times he slipped back into his mumbling, whiny persona. Luckily that effect was minimal.This is a film I would recommend to most. The only word of caution is the language is quite realistic for working class Lowell, Mass. In other words, the ""F"" word is utilized in every conceivable manner throughout. It's just part of the community fabric. Also, be warned that the boxing is also quite realistic ... it's a violent sport and that comes across very well. I loved how the boxing matches were filmed digitally for effect. Just a wonderfully well made film with terrific performances ... and actually quite uplifting!"
"This is the film that David O'Russell and the cast and crew have outdone themselves on. the best way to say it is WIcked outstanding. It not only told the story of ""Irish"" Micky Ward, Dickie Eklund and the family aspect but was a credit to the real internal and external struggle of never giving up. ""the fighter "" does proper justice to the hardworking ways and the People of Mass and Boston areas. In this film , the title has a double meaning as not only being a fighter as a boxer but speaks to many that in regular life that being ""The Fighter"" success can happen if you put the work in. The story does have strong female leads in this film that has never been shown in previous boxing based films. It is a cross over to both worlds ( male and female, Young and Old) and those that would usually skip a Boxing based film as it is much more then just that. I was at screening of ""The Fighter"" in the Beverly Hills theater with Director David O'Russell and main Cast ( Mark Wahlberg, Christian Bale, Amy Adams ,Melissa Leo) The Director and cast show their love and passion for this film and how hard they all worked to make this possible in their very warm words and replies to the questions from the audience. In all , a class group of fine professionals and actors put their heart and soul into this one and I hope their efforts are well rewarded when it comes time to nominate and vote for Oscars."
"Wow, what a movie. It's an inspirational true story of a boxer finally getting his break. It's also a story of addiction, and how it can affect loved ones. And above all, it's about family. There are some great boxing scenes in THE FIGHTER, they feel authentic and brutal, but the true fight is really outside the ring. Which is not to say this is an overbearing melodrama, no, far from it. It handles the subject matter gracefully. It has a lot of heart and can be quite funny, and there are some humorously absurd moments, something director David O. Russell has proved to be very good at providing.Mark Wahlberg gives a great performance playing the lead character, Micky. This is Wahlberg's most reserved and complex role to date. Micky has an unbreakable devotion to his family, which both strengthens and cripples him. He never really speaks for himself, and would rather suffer than upset those around him. Through the course of the movie the character really grows, thanks to the help of a good woman by his side. Mark Wahlberg shows a side of himself we've never seen before, this isn't the over-the-top badass THE DEPARTED Wahlberg, which don't get me wrong, is awesome too, but he finds a different range here. Truly the guy has come a long way from The Funky Bunch.Christian Bale is absolutely phenomenal in his scene-stealing role as Micky's drug-addicted brother. This is such a great character that Bale really brings a lot of depth to. Dicky's easily angered, often detached and oblivious to how his affliction is affecting his life. He's also ashamed and vulnerable. He's not the most reliable guy in the world and he's in need of a serious wake-up call. But the thing is...you can completely understand why Micky would stand by him for so long. Underneath it all, he really is a great guy, full of energy and affection- somebody you'd really want in your corner. This is sure to go down as one of Bale's most remembered roles, and hopefully his enormous talent will finally be recognized by winning an Academy Award for it.Behind every great man is a great woman, and Amy Adams also delivers a fantastic performance as Micky's girlfriend, who really helps him develop some backbone and at the same time is able to find some clarity in her misguided life. She's great in her role, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't thoroughly enjoy the eye-candy she brings to the movie. She has her fair share of revealing outfits and in one scene is shown wearing a see-through bra. Now THAT'S great filmmaking! Also notable, just because it stood out to me, is that Conan O'Brien's sister, Kate, has a role in the movie, playing one of Micky's sisters. I sort of wish I wasn't privy to this information before seeing it because her resemblance to the goofy talk show host is uncanny...and a little disturbing.I don't know why a lot of the most involving sports movies happen to be about boxing, I guess there's just something so primal and against all logic about people that get the crap beaten out of them for a living. It's worth knowing what makes these people tick. Yes, this is based on a true story, but I'm sure it's been tailored to fit Hollywood needs. Events have likely been rearranged and certain moments probably fabricated or altered, but THE FIGHTER doesn't attempt to portray the family shown here in a completely positive light. Nobody is a saint here, and everyone has their faults. When it finally arrives at its conclusion it is relieving, satisfying, and yes, inspiring. This is ultimately a happy story well deserving to be told on film but the sad reality is that there are no doubt hundreds and hundreds of similar stories that didn't end up quite as well. I can't tell you what exactly makes the family depicted in this movie so special. Maybe they're stronger, and more willing to compromise, and just maybe a little lucky, too. But I was left recalling a scene from the movie THE STRAIGHT STORY, where Richard Farnsworth lays down some wisdom upon a teenage runaway: he told her how he would give each of his kids a stick and ask them to snap them, which was easy. Then he'd give them a whole bundle, which couldn't be broken. ""That's family."""
"There has been a trend this year to show the darker side of nature in movies, both on TV and on the movie screens, and ""The Fighter"" continues to expose those festering qualities that prevent us from bonding with each other and might end up having some very toxic results. However, ""The Fighter"" shows an interesting point of view, as it balances the negative with some redemptive moments; some of which shine because of a very outstanding group of actors.For starters, Melissa Leo and Amy Adams surpass any work they have previously done as the obsessive and supportive female leads in the story. Leo, as the mother who is blind to her own powerful interventions and interferences, almost leading to the destruction of her own children. Adams, is a tower of strength, with a caustic underside. She is a vulnerable woman who has grown tougher because of her own life experiences, and she finally finds someone who understands and needs her. Still, she must now face a group of siblings who might prove to be more than she wants to handle.In ""The Town"" we saw how the environment shapes the nature of human beings, and finding success is pretty elusive. In most cases, the results are the reverse and tragic. Mark Whalberg's Mickey has reached that crucial moment in his life, when he must choose to detach himself from a stiffling family environment and pursue his dream, with the proper support. It is time to go for his life's dream, and though it might be a little too late and very difficult because of Dicky's (Bale) constant self-destructive moves and their aftermath, Mickey might never see his dreams come true.Bale, who has done superlative work in more than a dozen films, from his superb debut in ""Empire of The Sun"", completely outshines everyone else in the film, and regardless of the barrage of publicity out there, his is a leading man's turn, dark, subversive, suicidal, pathetic, emotional, and an effective and affective portrayal of a man who is about to hit bottom, someone who is now apparently unaware of how much pain his actions can cause. As the older brother who is now addicted to drugs, he can't see the way he is dragging everyone else into his own hell, especially Mickey, a resilient but sweet character who can't break away from this situation.Eventually, fortunes change, and we see how it is possible to produce change. ""The Fighter"" never really explodes or overwhelms. In ""The Wrestler"" pain was intense both visually and emotionally, almost reaching torture levels for its protagonist and the audience. Here, there is a restrained sense of despair and even exhilaration is portrayed in an almost muted way. We want to ride the emotional waves of the main character, and this hardly happens. Unlike ""Milk"" where there was a documentary feel that make the events appear almost real, there is something amiss here; yet even that sense of detachment can't keep us from admiring the magnificent work done by Leo, Whalberg, Adams, and most impressively Bale, an actor who understands and undergoes the transformations required by the roles he chooses. It is impossible to imagine a darker Batman, a more demented yuppie, or a more traumatized child. In this movie, his physical and emotional transformation will bewitch you and add you to a list of admirers who have followed an artist who keeps delivering knockout performances, a true champion."
"When I worked in a kitchen one of my colleagues - Scott - was obsessed with films who seemed to spend every spare moment either in a cinema or at home with a pile of DVDs . I should point that he was someone who had no interest in anything art house . Everything Scott watched had to be either American , feature a big name or feature an action sequence so our tastes weren't very similar . Regardless of this one film Scott felt the need to rave about was THE FIGHTER . I'd seen the trailers and vaguely knew the story of Micky Ward and felt it was going to be clichÃ©d true story bio-pic with embellishment and a happy ending . In other words it was going to be a seen it all before sports movie ."" Okay Scott "" I asked "" What's the selling point ? "" "" The acting Theo .It's brilliantly acted especially Christian Bale who plays MarkWahlberg's brother . He plays his trainer "" Sometimes acting alone can't carry a film - only bring a film down and when I watch a film I'm after a good story so decided not to bother with THE FIGHTER until it was broadcast on Channel 4 . After seeing it I came to the conclusion that both Scott's opinion and my own are totally correct Bale is an actor who is fortunate in that the roles he will be most remembered for are those that belong in a franchise such as BATMAN BEGINS and TERMINATOR SALVATION . You could argue he's luckier than he is talented but here as Micky Ward's half brother Dicky Eklund , a crack addicted , brain damaged former boxer he gives an acting tour de force . You know when you're on the bus and someone gets on and you mutter to yourself "" Please don't sit anywhere near me please "" that's the exact feeling you see when Eklund appears on screen . One wonders if Bale should have been drug tested after each scene such is his convincing performance . It's a story of mean streets and of mean people hitting rock bottom and you don't feel you're watching actors merely going through their pacesWhere the film does fall down it's down to the usual flaw of making true stories dramatic and having to restructure things . Ward beats up and coming boxer Alfonso Sanchez which means he gets a world title shot against Shea Neary in Britain . In reality Ward fought another 6 fights , losing two of them before he got the title fight against Neary and with all due respect the title fight in question was for the World Boxing Union ( WBU ) which most boxing fans consider a mere "" alphabet title "" not a world title at all . Also the film feels the need to dramatise the fight with Ward being dead on his feet in round three . In reality Ward was wobbled in that round but didn't hit the deck . The fight was a slugfest for sure but was never as one sided as portrayed here . Perhaps most disappointingly of all Ward's three legendary fights with Arturo Gatti are relegated to a caption at the end of the movie In all THE FIGHTER is the cinematic equivalent of the battle between Marvelous Marvin Hagler and Sugar Ray Leonard . It's a definite split decision . You can se why people loved the film , you can see why people liked the film , you can see why people disliked it and perhaps why people hated it . I'm certainly hedging my bets and voting for a draw"
"The Fighter is a biography about two brothers with modest beginnings in a small US city. Bale plays the older brother, a drug addict and a failed past in boxing practice. Mark Wahlberg is the younger brother, protagonist of the story and the sportsman's most successful in this dysfunctional family, though it be the cause of your lack of progress. Bale and Melissa Leo (played well a compliant and fanatic mother) won one Oscar with this film, but the role of Amy Adams is also relevant. Given the characteristics of the actors themselves, it would be hard to get better for the type of characters that exist in the film. I really liked the character of Amy Adams but Christian Bale's performance is awesome. One more character to remember."
"The Fighter is based on the true story of boxer ""Irish"" Micky Ward's unlikely rise through the ranks to the WBU (World Boxing Union) light-welterweight title.Micky's story would be a conventional sports film if not for the presence of his half-brother Dicky, a boxer-turned-trainer whose life was screwed up by crack addiction and the petty crimes that associated with that life.The brother, played by Christian Bale, makes the story interesting and charges it emotionally. Bale bursts from the skin of his character, igniting every frame with his energy (reminding, occasionally of his role as the high-energy boy in Empire of the Sun). As in The Mechanic, Bale lost a lot of weight preparing for the gaunt crack-addicted brother. He was 100 per cent convincing.Bale's character, Davy, exudes personality every time he enters a room or walks down a street. You know he is a drug-addled screw up and you know he is going to mess up his brother's life, but the brother loves him and is loyal to him so you want to see Davy rise above his problem.One of Bale's best scenes was shot on the front porch of the house where Charlene, Micky's girlfriend (played by Amy Adams) lives. Clean and sober after eight months in prison, Dicky carries a ton of baggage to that porch. He has hurt people. He has conned neighbors. He has disappointed everyone but his mother and his half brother. The entire town of Lowell, Massachusetts remembers Dicky as a boxer (""The pride of Lowell"") but they also remember him being addicted to crack, so nobody is prepared to believe he has gotten past the addiction during his eight months in prison.On the porch, Micky, knowing that he carries that baggage, wants to charm Charlene and patch things up for his brother. Charlene, however, is fueled by her complete distrust of Davy. She loves Micky and she has seen Dicky mess up Micky's life over and over again. On the porch, she has just walked away from Micky because he insists on being loyal to Dicky. No way is she going to be easily convinced that Davy has changed.She is skeptical of every word to come from Dicky's mouth, but Dicky pulls out all the stops in an effort to overcome his baggage and connect with her to make things right for his brother.The immovable object meets the irresistible force. It is a fine scene.Amy Adams is equally amazing in this film. As an actor, she is gutsy. Even when she started to command bigger paychecks, she continued to make independent films and bring to those indie films performances that made them better than they might have been. She never shies from a challenge. In this role she plays a worldly bartender who flunked out of college despite a full scholarship in high jump. As an athlete, she can understand with Micky.In the final analysis, it is Amy Adams who makes the chemistry work between Charlene and Micky. Wahlberg can be as wooden as Ben Affleck when it comes to romantic subtleties. Amy Adams in this role is like one of those good dancers on Dancing With The Stars who has to work with a partner who might as well be a post or a tree stump. While Wahlberg is unmoving, Amy Adams' performance reaches out and emotionally draws the scenes together.The Fighter has dimension to it, and a lot of the depth from the supporting cast.The mother played with conviction by Melissa Leo. She runs a family home surrounded by seven adult daughters, and all seem to either be living at home or visiting their mother a lot. The sisters are a hoot, sort of like a Greek chorus on a living room couch. Highly emotional, the sisters hate Micky's girlfriend. I loved them because there was something fascinatingly hideous about the sisters.Rocky, Raging Bull, Ali, Million Dollar Baby, and Cinderella Man are all fight films that have taken the viewer where The Fighter goes. No surprise there. Micky, as you expect, gets the crap beaten out of him. He struggles through the rank. He gets his shot at a title and he enters the ring against a better boxer to compete for a world championship. The sports genre always travels down a well-beaten path and always takes us to a happier place. Every sports film tells this oft-told tale. You enjoy the genre because getting there is what makes sports films a pleasure.The Fighter benefits from the fact that it is not just a sports film but a story of family and redemption. You family is important, addiction is not unbeatable. The Fighter is a feel good film with a lot of ugly stuff to overcome.IAlthough I put The Fighter along side most of the other boxing films, it could have been a lot better. If Micky had been more three-dimensional, the film might have been a classic. The elements are there, struggle and redemption. It's a true story with a lot of subtext, and that alone makes it better than Rocky. Unfortunately, Wahlberg is no DeNiro so it's no Raging Bull, and the script isn't up to Million Dollar Baby.That said, The Fighter is worth seeing. You'll like it for the performances by Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Melissa Leo and character actors whose faces you'll recognize from dozens of other films and television performances. You will love it for the feel-good arc, the love and redemption that are built into this genre.If you like boxing, you'll love the action. The camera work in the ring scenes is first rate and convincing. On the big screen, you feel every punch.However, if you are of that generation that hates boxing but likes cage fighting, there's no hope for you, sorry Â…"
"Alright.The Fighter is a true story about Mickey Ward - my favorite boxer. I grew up around this time, and watched most of the fights featured in the film. I recently wrote a sports-blog(for 4 years) about a variety of sports; boxing, football, baseball, basketball, etc. On one particular occasion I wrote a blog about 'The Top 20 Sports Moments Since 2000'. Amongst them were Michael Phelps' Gold Medal barrage, Usain Bolts' 100 meter world-record, and the 2004 Red Sox winning Major League Baseball's 100th World Series, which ended the Curse of the Bambino. What was #1? What event/moment did I single as the greatest? Mickey Ward's first fight against Arturro Gatti.It was a fight that made movies like Rocky 3 marginally realistic. The brawl of brawls. The most violent, epic, unforgettable, irreplaceable, 'shake your hand on your buddies head'' moment of sports Godliness. It took boxing fans back to the pre-depression days of bare-knuckle fights and hard-men, and reminded us of the euphoric heights of heart and determination that can be captured in sport.Not even a strong performance from Christian Bale can make up for that sports' moment being left out of this screenplay. We can only hope that Aronofsky's drama/comedy will get non-boxing fans to look into the career of Mickey Ward - so that they might see that fight.Bale's performance is amazing, but I don't think that Mark Wahlberg really captured the role of Mickey in the same way. At least he didn't immerse himself into the character in the same way as Bale, and the biggest resemblance he had with Mickey was his physique.This was a very good movie; entertaining, fast-paced, with a brisk running time. 'The Fighter' isn't quite as good as its' current ranking here, but it should crack the years Ten Best, IMO. The boxing scenes are more realistic than most, and the interaction between Mickey's family and circle of friends is priceless.Good. Not great! Nudged out 'The Town' as the best movie I saw this week. If Wahlberg was on par with bale, and if this had gone another half-hour and included the Ward/Gatti fight, it might have scored as high as a 8-8.5.75/100Solid Recommendation.You'll like it if you like: Bull Durham, Without Limits, Conviction, and Rocky Balboa."
"On the rise to fame and success, a young boxer must decide whether to continue training with his family or seek professional training and management elsewhere in this sports drama based on true events. Mark Wahlberg is solid as the conflicted boxer in question and Amy Adams does well cast-against-type as his foul-mouthed bartender girlfriend, but is Christian Bale who steals every scene he is in as Wahlberg's older brother. A former boxing legend himself, Bale has delusions of grandeur and believes that the TV crew who have recently arrived to film him are making a documentary about his long awaited comeback when in reality they are making a film about his descent into heroine addiction. The overall film fascinatingly follows this structure too, opening with a lot of focus on Bale, only for Wahlberg to be eventually revealed as the true star (what a great metaphor for Bale's character coming to realise that not everything is about him). Melissa Leo also gets quite a bit of screen time as the brothers' overbearing mother, however, the rest of the family are disappointingly barely fleshed out all, including Jack McGee as Wahlberg's father, who could have been quite interesting given that he actually sides with Adams about his son's career. As for the sisters, they are all interchangeable stereotypes. This is, however, principally a film about the brothers and their every interaction is compelling. The end credits are also worth watching here for appearances by the brothers whose lives the film was based on - Dicky and Micky Ward."
"Powered by terrific performances from its cast, The Fighter also happens to be David O. Russell's best film to date that may not rank amongst the finest examples of its genre but it still serves as a competently crafted sports biopic that's less about the sport & more about the athlete, his family & his path to redemption.The story of The Fighter follows the life of professional boxer Micky Ward who withdraws from the boxing world after suffering a humiliating defeat in a match he already had reservations about. The plot chronicles the journey he takes to get back into the ring while focusing on his relationship with his brother whose own life has taken a self-destructive route.Directed by David O. Russell (best known for Silver Linings Playbook & American Hustle), the story journeys the same route that majority of boxing films tend to take plus also falls flat in between on a few occasions but what infuses a vibrant energy into it is the rich set of interesting characters it packs in & a talented ensemble that brings those characters to life with finesse.The boxing sequences are brilliantly choreographed and do provide the necessary adrenaline high when it matters but this picture is more focused on the relationship between the two brothers and illustrates it amazingly well, for those moments do pack a powerful punch. But it also suffers from letting it characters go a bit overboard at times, something that has become a norm in O. Russell's films of lately.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Mark Wahlberg, Amy Adams, Christian Bale & Melissa Leo, with Bale & Leo impressing the most. It's not that the input by leading cast falls short in any aspect, it's just that Bale & Leo take their supporting characters to a different level, and the Academy Award they won for their respective works in this feature film is definitely an earned one.On an overall scale, The Fighter is no genre masterpiece but it still offers a sufficiently entertaining ride that will leave majority of its viewers satisfied in the end. It's not without its shortcomings but most of them get brushed away by the powerful, explosive & riveting performances delivered by its ensemble. The story isn't memorable by any means but what Bale & Leo pull off here will continue to reverberate for a few more years down the line."
"Ever since it was announced that Wahlberg was trying to get this film made - and that was a looooooong time ago at this stage - I have been eagerly awaiting the arrival of this film. I was not disappointed.Not to re-hash the story too much but this is a real life story of Boston boxer 'Irish' Micky Ward and the struggles with his career, personal and family life in the mid-90s. Wahlberg is Micky Ward and Bale plays his crack addicted, squirrelly brother Dicky Eklund. The style of the film is more realistic than the likes of 'Rocky', 'Raging Bull' and other fight films. It has some nice HBO TV style fight scenes which is shot is a clearer presentation akin to watching the bouts on prime-time television. But the meat of the story and the conflict is not in Micky's quest to achieve a world title - but in his ultimately uncomfortable relationship he has with his family. 7 girls, 2 boys, 2 fathers and 1 mother is a hell of a mix in a poor neighbourhood. Add to that Micky's mother is also his manager, his brother is his coach, his father also a coach and you see how complicated this could become. Micky is essentially the meal ticket for the entire clan.Performances: Bale is terrific. If he doesn't get the Best Supporting Actor Oscar this year, then I'll eat my left shoe. (I might regret that last statement as Geoffrey Rush seems to be swooping that accolade for 'The King's Speech') But nonetheless - Bale deserves it. His portrayal of a crack addicted, might-have-been is spot on. Twitchy, wide-eyed, slurred but his stint in prison and the viewing of his so called 'comeback' documentary straightened him out and made him realise what is important. Family. His brother. Adams is a ballsy character too - she has to be to survive in this environment. A strong woman who stands up for herself and her man against a formidable family group. I didn't know anything about Adams previous to this film but she seems to have that slightly grubby yet likable nature about her. Leo as the mother/manager is a tough piece of work also. The family actually reminds me of so many families that I grew up with and in - that even though you know it is exaggerated on screen - there are many veins of truth running through it. Lastly - but not least - Wahlberg himself. He has such a quiet way about him that even though he is a tough cookie, grew up in VERY similar circumstances to Ward and portrays a hardy boxer with a physique to match any professional - he remains an enigma. He comes across as a truly nice guy - both on screen and in real life. Even though he has had his brushes with the law (most famously his own stint in jail for a racist assault which resulted in his victim being left permanently blind in one eye), he really seems to have his life on track. Successful actor, producer, father and husband is a testament to his ability to stay the track. Here - his performance is an understated one but still packs a punch amidst the other more animated characters. He is the soul of the film both on the screen and in the background trying to get the thing made. None of the honours mention him but he knows deep down he has made something to be very proud of. Well done Marky Mark - you've come a long way from the Funky Bunch.Overall - I'll score this 8/10. Some scenes a little slow to boil, some 'patchy' dialogue in places but overall it's heart is in the right place."
"For whatever reason, considering the low real-world current popularity of the sport, boxing fares quite well at the cinema (think Rocky, The Champ, & Million Dollar Baby to name a few). That tradition continues with ""The Fighter"", a film that delves into so many more themes than just the sweet science.For a basic plot summary, ""The Fighter"" tells the dual stories of brothers Mickey Ward (Mark Wahlberg) and Dickie Ecklund (Christian Bale). Coming from a family of almost total dysfunction and seemingly headed for a life of manual labor, the boxing brothers each face their own inner demons as Mickey takes his ""last shot"" at pugilistic success.What really makes this a spectacular movie is the incredible complexity of the characters. Nothing is black-and-white about the entire experience, with all the plots/characters providing ample opportunities for shades of grey (the sign of most truly great movies). Nothing is predictable whatsoever, with the character dynamics changing regularly as the situations dictate. From beginning to end, the intense emotional roller-coaster will keep you on the edge of your seat.Of course, what makes those emotions really ""pop"" are the incredible acting performances. Bale nearly steals the entire show as the enigmatic Dickie, cementing himself as perhaps the greatest pure actor of the present day. Wahlberg also nails the emotionally-drained Ward as he tries to navigate the pathetic petty family drama. Finally, Amy Adams (playing Charlene, Mickey's girlfriend) shows her acting chops as the fulcrum point from which Mickey goes from ""hanger- on"" to ""legitimate contender"".The directing is adept as well, considering that no scene or character is wasted. Every single frame and interaction is meaningful in the overall scheme of things.Thus, I consider ""The Fighter"" to be one of the greatest sports films of all-time. Everything (from acting to plot to direction) is solid and no time is wasted in the hour and fifty minute runtime. I could have watched two MORE hours and not have been bored in the slightest."
"Long in the development pipeline, and long something of a labour of love for actor Mark Wahlberg, The Fighter arrives just before Awards season, depicting a often-told story about overcoming obstacles to reach your dream. Wahlberg, who takes centre stage as Irish-American welterweight boxer Mickey Ward, spent four years bulking himself up for the part and learning to fight like a professional fighter. You have to admire his dedication, as his performance and the film itself is surprisingly excellent. After all, this story has already been told in the form of Rocky, although that was told with a more fairytale edge. The Fighter is grounded in a very miserable reality, where poverty and crack-addiction is rife.Trained by his former-professional boxer half-brother Dickie (Christian Bale), Mickey is going from fight to fight making little money and usually getting his arse handed to him. He is what is known in the boxing world as a 'stepping stone' - someone to knock out the way just before your big shot. Things aren't helped by the fact that Dickie is an unreliable crack-head, and his manager mother, is selfish and only sees what would be beneficial to her family, rather than Mickey's career. Mickey O'Keefe, a policeman and Mickey's co-trainer, believes him to be a formidable fighter, trying to do the right thing while his family keep messing things up. When Dickie is arrested and is jailed for a long stint, Mickey quits boxing and shacks up with feisty bartender Charlene (Amy Adams), much to his mother's and his seven sister's dismay. When an opportunity presents itself, Mickey must decide what is right and consider stepping back into the ring and fulfil his potential.So far, so clichÃ©, you may think. And you would be right to think that too, as the film does tick all the boxes. Yet it has never been done with so much dedication and heart, and this pours onto the screen for us to see. It's a film of (excuse the pun) knockout (sorry!) performances by a highly talented cast. The critics have raved about him, yet the Awards panels have failed to recognise Mark Wahlberg's restrained performance as the shy, quiet Mickey. He holds the film together as it's a film that needs a central character that you can truly root for, and Wahlberg nails it. Perhaps because it is a less showy performance than the other actors, but Wahlberg can stand tall after this, capturing the standard of acting that we have seen previously in Boogie Nights and The Yards. It is Christian Bale, however, that is scooping up the awards, and has received an Oscar nomination for his painful depiction of drug- addled Dickie Eklund. It is a fine showcase for possibly the finest actor around at the moment, and you can only sit back in awe at his complete dedication to his craft. He apparently stayed in character throughout shooting, and he lost a lot of weight to portray the decimation of Dickie's addiction. Of course, he's done this before in The Machinist, but here his acting overshadows the physical attributes.The downside to the film is it's clichÃ©s, but I was so completely engrossed in the story and the characters that I just didn't care. It is difficult for the sports genre as a whole, as their is always something that has been done before. The better sports films of the last few years - Friday Night Lights, Million Dollar Baby, The Wrestler - also had to sacrifice originality for the sake of telling a good story, and it's the same here. Kudos, though, for director David O. Russell (who directed the fantastic Three Kings and I Heart Huckabees - both containing great Wahlberg performances) who takes an unfussy, no-nonsense approach. During the dramatic scenes, he simply points the camera and allows his actors to act, and the story to be told. He changes this, however, during the slightly disappointing boxing scenes, which are clearly influenced by Scorsese's Raging Bull, but lacking the magic and artistic flair of the 1980 classic.Although it's never going to win the Best Picture Oscar, it is a worthy contender, much like it's protagonist. I hope Bale will received the award he so thoroughly deserves, and Wahlberg will realise he's not an action star, but a very good actor. A very pleasant surprise.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
"Based on the True story of ""Irish"" Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg), the Massachusetts born professional boxer.David O. Russell's ""The Fighter"" follows the story of a young man who grew up adoring his older half brother Dicky (Christian Bale) the hyperactive drug addicted professional boxer who once knocked down Sugar Ray Leonard in '78. To say Micky has a dysfunctional family would be an enormous understatement, with an overhaul of nicotine addicted controlling females led by the mother of the family, Alice (Melissa Leo) who believes she is managing his career but is blindly a burden on his professional & social life.Micky encounters a heavily mismatched opponent organised by his family which was intended to be a morale boost leaves the hero of the film battered & embarrassed of his loss. His Life begins to change for the better when he begins to date Charlene (Amy Adams) a local barmaid popular with the men, who slowly opens his eyes that the problem with his life has been the influence of his family.After a potentially career ending incident involving his brother/mentor Dicky, our central character with the forceful help of Charlene avoids his family and begins to train seriously with a fresh team of supporting staff; his father (Jack McGee), long-time trainer played by the real life Mickey O'Keefe & a new manager Sal (Frank Renzulli).An extremely well re-created documentary of the original HBO feature titled ""High on Crack Street: Lost Lives in Lowell"" follows Dicky's long-time drug addiction to crack cocaine takes place during the film and is moving to watch.There's an enormous amount of pressure on any Boxing based drama in cinema. With legendary classics Rocky (1975), Raging Bull (1980) or more recently Million Dollar Baby (2004), The Wrestler (2008) any film of this genre is going to be viewed with this comparison. The Fighter does extremely well to live up to it's predecessors on the screen.Bale & Leo are flawless, arguably the finest we've seen them! Ever since the commitment Bale made to The Machinist (2004) dropping an excruciating 63Lbs for the role and then gaining it all back within weeks for the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman in Batman Begins (2005) he confirmed to audiences that he is a true character actor and is dedicated to his art. Wahlberg is steady, ""The Fighter"" is an appropriate fit for his style of acting, recently he has made some poor career decisions he has admitted to himself; Max Payne (2008), The Happening (2008). At times he reminds his audience what he's capable of with quality performances such as I Heart Huckabees (2004), which was his 2nd collaboration with Director David O. Russell and most notably Scorsese's Best Picture Winner The Departed (2006) for which he earned his Academy Award Nomination.In summary The Fighter has a lot to offer a wide variety of viewers and is well worth the line up & ticket price. 4 out of 5 Stars"
"As any movie of this type has to do, it finally draws you into the protagonist's situation and gets you rooting for him. In this case the protagonist is real-life boxer Mickey Ward (Mark Wahlberg) who has to overcome big odds - not the least of which is an extremely dysfunctional family headed up by his controlling mother Alice (Melissa Leo) and his drug addict brother Dicky (Christian Bale) who used to be a boxer and who's claim to fame was knocking down Sugar Ray Leonard (or did Sugar Ray slip?) and who now wants to live his dream through his brother. I appreciated the fact that Sugar Ray appeared as himself in a couple of brief scenes. By the time Mickey gets his title shot you are rooting for him, and you do admire his strength in overcoming the challenges he's faced. The actual title shot, mind you, struck me as a bit anti- climactic to be honest. It was pretty quickly portrayed and frankly the whole thing ultimately left me a bit empty, although I was satisfied to see Mickey become the champ.For three-quarters of the movie, though, the focus is really on the dysfunctional family relationship, and the challenge presented to that relationship by the sudden appearance of Charlene (Amy Adams) - a local bartender and college dropout who hooks up with Mickey and pushes him to escape his family's controlling influence. This was a good performance from Adams. I found her the most interesting of the cast, because she was playing a character very different from the usual cute and sweet roles I've seen her in, and so she demonstrated a versatility I hadn't seen from her before. Wahlberg and Bale were all right, but I didn't find anything especially noteworthy about their performances.In the end, the biggest weakness of this movie was that it really failed to draw me in until the title fight (and to an extent the fight that led up to the title fight.) I was bored frankly by the family, who struck me as a sort of Massachussetts version of ""white trash"" and who weren't really all that interesting. I can't imagine growing up with those sisters. Mickey deserves credit just for not punching any of them out. This really didn't do a great deal for me. It offers about half an hour that really intensely interested me, which fizzled out in a truly too abrupt ending and focused mostly on an unappealing family."
"This film is about a boxer who rises to stardom with the help of his half-brother, who is an ex-boxer that messes his career up by indulging in illicit drugs.I was expecting something as emotionally gripping and touching as ""The Wrestler"", but ""The Fighter"" is nowhere near as good. ""The Fighter"" is so dialog heavy, and most of the time the dialog is just arguments or some unimportant nonsense. This constant babbling already put me off early into the film. The story itself is not engaging, the emotional highs and lows are not so pronounced. It just does not grip me and does not offer me an emotional ride. As a boxing film, ""The Fighter"" may work, but not as an Oscar worthy tearjerker."
"Writing a review for a film like the fighter is extremely difficult to do.A review is supposed to highlight the good and bad of it's subject, the things that worked and the things that didn't. The performances that inspired and the ones that just couldn't keep up.You see, my problem with the fighter is that there is no problem at all, I simply cannot think of anything bad about it, anything I would tweak, change or challenge...I think the fighter is a masterpiece and I have fallen completely and utterly in love with it.This is a rarity for me, normally there is at least something in a movie, TV program or book that I just think could have been better, or that I think was not needed, but right now I am completely stumped.I have to admit that before watching this film I had my reservations. I have never really liked boxing movies before. I never understood the hype over Rocky and Raging Bull. I was also unsure of the cast. On paper it looked like an excuse for Mark Wahlberg to be the tough guy, and what the hell was the chirpy girl from Enchanted doing in a heavy film like the fighter? The only thing I new with certainty was that Christian Bale would give a performance that I would love, simply because he always does. I think one of the things that makes the fighter work so well is that it is not over ambitious, yes the movie is about a boxer but it is not about the sport itself, boxing is a supporting role to a story about family. It doesn't get lost in all the drama and violence of the sport but focus's on the personal life's of those involved. This is a refreshing change.I can talk about this movie all day, I could talk about David O Russell's great directing, the exceptional script and great shooting work until I am blue in the face. But I only have a character limit of 1000 words, besides the thing that makes the fighter so good is the performances from its exceptional cast.This is Mark Wahlbergs labour of love, the film he has been trying to make for years and he poured his heart and soul into his character Micky. His understated and underestimated performance in this film was unexpected. Micky is quiet and peaceful, even when the world is erupting around him and his family are making life unbearable he still manages to keep his cool and deal with the punches as they come. Did he deserve an Oscar nomination for this performance? Probably yes, yet I am not surprised that he didn't. His performance and his characters quietness is simply overwhelmed by the loud, proud and damn craziness of the supporting cast and characters.Christian Bale, in this movie, is a revelation. I would go as far to say that it is one of the best performances I have ever seen from an actor. Yet again he dropped weight for this role, and yet again he has been criticized. The criticism is uncalled for and unfair, he is playing a former welterweight boxer who is addicted to crack, show me one of those who are not skinny to the bone. He pretty much steals the show here and has proved to many that he really is one of the actors of our generation.It is not only Bale who impresses in this movie, Melissa Leo who plays Micky and Dicky's mother is fierce and loyal. She is aggressive in her love for her children, and I pray for anyone that ever gets in her way. Leo's performance is worthy of her Oscar nomination, she is tough and edgy, a woman struggling to hold everything together when in reality everything is falling apart. Amy Adams who plays Micky's girlfriend Charlene is also brilliant, she is as tough as Leo and provides a lot of the humour with her bad ass attitude and fierce loyalty for Micky.The fighter is without doubt one of the films of the year and maybe even the best boxing movie to come out of Hollywood. It feels real and the performances are some of the best I have seen. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.And, if Christian Bale does not come out of this with an Oscar I shall ignore the academy awards for the rest of my existence."
"There have been so many good boxing movies over the years: Raging Bull and Rocky set the bar extremely high for boxing movies; On the Waterfront showed a great portrayal of a failed boxer dealing with life; Million Dollar Baby was a spectacular look at the relationship between boxer and trainer; Cinderella Man was a perfect example of the comeback; Somebody Up There Likes Me was a nice movie; The Boxer (Daniel Day Lewis) was a great film about overcoming the odds; Hard Times (Charles Bronson) was a terrific film about bare fisted boxing.The Fighter was not comparable to the aforementioned movies in many ways: there was no character development whatsoever -- so you do not feel the joy of a Rocky winning or the pain of Maggie Fitzgerald breaking her neck -- you feel nothing at the end. The script was laced with profanity -- way too much profanity -- you feel like you are the one being punched in the face with all the foul language. I do not think there is a single line that does not have the F-bomb (or an equivalent vileness) spouted from any of the characters. The movie plays like a foul-mouthed Jerry Springer episode and looks like it was made for today's vile, uneducated, ignorant generation.I admire that the ""real"" Mickey fought against the odds and won a title and I admire that the ""real"" Dicky cleaned his life up and went on to help his brother in his time of need. I do not think the movie's portrayal of the characters did much to emphasize what could have been a good movie about comebacks and life changes.Not Rocky--not Raging Bull--nowhere near Million Dollar Baby or Cinderella Man--wait for it on video."
"Wahlberg plays an aging boxer trying to catch a break and finally win an important match in an attempt to boost his career. In between the repetitive scenes showing him train, the audience is treated to a rambling screenplay (consisting primarily of totally dense individuals bickering and shouting) and the most irritating characters in film known to man. No clichÃ© is left untouched; the white trash family members (E.T.), the love interest from the local bar (A space Odyssey) and of course the poorly shot boxing sequences (Groundhog Day, et al). Words fail me to describe my perplexity as I try to make sense of the 7.8 rating this parody of film making has somehow garnered. I gave up on the reliability of this website's movie scores long ago, but people really need to get some perspective, it's becoming embarrassing..2/10"
"The Fighter (2010)It's hard to make a boxing movie that isn't just another boxing movie, and yet it happens over and over again. The drama in the ring and the cast of odd characters behind the scenes, and the unlikely heroes that most boxers make, are great storytelling stuff. And ""The Fighter"" shows it has the goods, even if it is, at is core, just another boxing movie.What makes this one special is the particular oddity that two brothers were both contenders, and the family supporting one and then (in a way) the other in their quests was quirky and often nasty in the process. Set in Lowell, Mass., this is working class America of the last two decades, filled with rough poverty, drugs, and its fair share (plus some) of small city losers, one way or another. That's why a winner, or two winners, makes such a fabulous splash. Yet the story is laced with genuine heartbreak, anger, selfishness, idiocy...and determination and savvy. In the end, something comes out of all this that makes a special case for never prejudging people. That might apply most of all to the family of these two men, with the infighting and truly narrowminded views they naturally had, almost housebound in a poor neighborhood. It's easy to point to the two actors at the center of it, Mark Wahlberg as the younger brother and a shot at the title and Christian Bale as the older one with a serious crack problem. But the rest of the cast, the promoters and the parade of sisters, not to mention the steely over zealous mother and the good guy dad, are all amazing. Amy Adams, an extraordinary talent, comes through with hardened realism as the girlfriend, as well.The filming here is very good if not conspicuous (it's no ""Raging Bull""), and the story line, hobbled a bit by the fact that it's a true story and had to stick to certain facts, is more inspiring than interesting or dramatic. I mean that in a filmic sense--the boxing part of the story in particular, of an underdog rising up, has been told too often to be especially gripping. But then, it's all handled so well, and acted with such intensity, you'll end up sucked in and impressed by the end, whatever your (and my) reservations."
"[3 Stars] ""The Fighter"" arrived on these shores adorned with nominations and plaudits aplenty. Some went so far as to say that the film was ""the best boxing film since Rocky"", Esquire magazine having apparently missed ""Raging Bull"" altogether. It is a shame, therefore, that the actual film should be so thoroughly ordinary.It is not a bad film at all. It is solid, pretty watchable, pretty interesting fare. The true story of Micky Ward's rise in boxing is one of those stories which sport throws up that seems born for Hollywood. But, Hollywood this is. The film is clichÃ©d and predictable. It says very little but portrays a story of hard circumstances overcome in a manner which is more populist than the film's box office would suggest, the film's harder side counting against it there.It is however nothing extraordinary. David O. Russell certainly brings an ounce of originality with the frenetic style of the film â€“ fast moving cameras, numerous cuts, characters jabbering over each other on and off screen â€“ but none of this makes the film more gripping or appears to serve any real purpose. It jogs along following the expected path â€“ solid, good, occasionally funny, and unremarkable. The victories do not seem to matter as much as they should. The trials and lows of the film are not very affecting. Nothing stands out.That is with the exception of the acting, which is fantastic. Christian Bale has received all of the nominations for his bold and flashy performance as Micky Ward's crack-addict brother, Dicky Ecklund, and rightly so. After the disappointment of his dull turn in ""Public Enemies"", this is Bale back on form. However, as he acknowledged when accepting his Golden Globe, he wouldn't have got away with it without the sterling work from Mark Wahlberg, whose understated central turn is lead-acting at its best. He is always interesting, always gripping and gives the film its drive. He makes it watchable.In the supporting roles, there is seemingly a great battle going on between Amy Adams and Melissa Leo for the supporting actress gongs this year, and rightly so. Adams continues to establish herself as an extremely versatile and effective young actress with a great future ahead of her. However, it is Leo who should triumph for her barnstorming performance of the battle-axe mother of the two brothers. She is absolutely brutal on screen and entertaining. Though her character as written is slightly monotonous, she manages to disguise this very adroitly.However, the film leaves its audience impressed by the quality of the acting but unimpressed by the film as a whole. Frankly, there are better ways to spend seven or eight pounds. Get ""Raging Bull"" out on DVD, or organise a whip-round so that Esquire can watch ""Raging Bull"". As for ""The Fighter"", it shall dimly fade, but the performances will remain as fine examples of the actor's craft."
"David O. Russell's The Fighter is about Mickey Ward, a personality-free junior welterweight fighter (Mark Wahlberg) the working class town of Lowell, Massachusetts whose struggles are as much outside of the ring as inside. Based on a true story, the film revolves around Mick's s relationship with his dysfunctional family that includes his half-brother Dickie Eklund (Christian Bale), an ex-fighter called ""The Pride of Lowell"" because he survived ten rounds with Sugar Ray Leonard, his overbearing trash-talking mother, Alice (Melissa Leo) and his repellent seven sisters who are little more than caricatures. Mick worships Dickie who insists he once floored Sugar Ray Leonard, but Dickie has become a crack addict who is unfit for the ring except to act as his brother's trainer.A wiry, hyper-active individual, a role at times overplayed by Bale, Dickie is interviewed by HBO who Dickie thinks they are filming a documentary on his boxing career only to find out that it is really a documentary about crack addiction in Lowell. When Mick is thrown into the ring with a fighter who weighs twenty pounds more than him and is beaten to little short of a pulp, Mick begins to open his eyes to the fact that his career is being mishandled. The issue becomes further crystallized when he meets Charlene Fleming (Amy Adams), a former college student who works as a bar girl, who tells him that he should accept a promoter's offer to train in Las Vegas, away from the influence of his unstable family.Charlene is a tough cookie with a good sense of humor and doesn't back down easily. Her resolve is tested, however, when she has to confront Mick's mother and his seven sisters who hold her opinion in little regard. With Dickie serving a prison term for impersonating a police officer, Mick's turnaround in the ring begins when he hires a local cop to be his manager, leading him to a string of victories and an upcoming title fight in London, England, the emotional high point of the film. The push and pull continues with Dickie, however, when he is released from prison and wants to resume his role as Mick's trainer. Mick's fight is as much for his manhood as it is for control of his career, but the issue is never satisfactorily resolved.The fights are orchestrated for maximum audience involvement. Somewhat akin to Ali's ""rope-a-dope"", Mick is repeatedly pummeled in the early rounds of his fights but comes to life when it seems he is done for. Though this is an unlikely scenario, Russell makes it believable and, at times exciting. Mick, however, is a reluctant warrior who seems strangely out of place in a boxing ring. Comparisons have been made between Rocky (1976) and The Fighter. Rocky was also a gritty boxing movie about an underdog from the wrong side of the tracks who overcomes great odds to become a champion. Rocky Balboa, however, had heart and soul and inspired people to root for him and the film made you feel better about yourself. Though there is some fine acting in The Fighter, especially by Amy Adams, unlike Rocky, we never have much invested in the outcome."
"Well acted production tells the story of one family, two brothers - all of whom have their own issues to be dealt with. A pretty good portrayal of a hard scrabble life in Lowell, MA.Dialogue, script, acting and direction are all good; but, nothing really struck me as benefiting all the hype this film has generated.This is not a boxing movie; rather, a well done character study.Worth a couple of hours in the theater with good popcorn - an escape only - you'll not leave the theater reveling about the film - maybe not even thinking of it once you get as far as your car.Three stars for the acting only, not the entire package."
"This was such a let down, am I the only person who sees through the hype. The film starts with a funky bouncy walk down the street . It promises so much however ends up so flat, It's like a predictable TV movie lacking any punch and when the predictable love interest and the overbearing family arrive on the scene it dissolves into a 12 round slug fest, dead on the canvas all the characters are annoying and there is more shouting than a Jerry Springer movie.. I wish Christian Bale and the whole family would just OD immediately Some of the reviews have the audacity to put it in the same ring as Raging Bull ,,,, eh get a life. (And lets not forget about the schmalzy American Rock soundtrack - dire It was dull,, unengaging and ultimately predictable tosh,,, I would rather watch Rocky 10 Intacto I can steal your luck"
"This is based on the true story of boxer Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) and his half brother Dicky (Christian Bale), a junkie. They live in working class Lowell, Massachusetts, where everyone is aware of Micky's poor results. Micky is managed by Dicky and his eccentric mother Alice (Melissa Leo). Dickie is deluded by the idea that he himself is going to make a comeback and that the camera crew following him are going to make a movie about his life. Frustratingly for Micky, he has not been winning many of his fights as the opponents organised by Dicky are regularly superior. Further dominating Micky's life are his six sisters, who move together in a pack. The family ties are disrupted when Micky becomes involved with the barmaid Charlene (Amy Adams), a girl who the sisters do not trust at all. When Dicky is arrested and put in gaol Micky is given an offer by a more professional manager, who says he does not want Dicky around as he is too much trouble. Micky must decide whether he is going to turn his back on his brother who has trained him and provided him with regular knowledge. It took me a long time to warm to Christian Bale's performance in The Fighter. He's so extreme as Dickie, having slimmed down significantly and possessing such highly wired body language. It initially seems like a caricature of a junkie. But David O. Russell's film is too smart to fall into simplicity. As the story develops, Bale's multilayered performance works to accentuate the soul of the film: pride. Dickie's showiness and exaggeration is deliberate. He's playing up to the cameras in the film, thinking they're making a movie about his life. But as he becomes aware of the reality and the shame that he has brought on himself and most significantly his young son, his star fades. Bale touchingly infuses his character with a vulnerable consciousness. O. Russell skilfully draws this notion of pride from the other performances too. Tension is built from the decay of the family structure. We learn that Alice has been preparing both of her sons to be boxers since they were small children and thus she is not a caricature either. She's extremely possessive but her position as both a mother and a manager is understandable. The best scenes in the film, some of the funniest too, are shared with Alice and the six sisters. They work extremely well to accentuate the themes of family and pride and how significant these values are in a working class town. Out of all the characters however, Adams is the standout. After playing a nun in Doubt she transforms herself seamlessly into a foul mouthed, hardened barmaid. What we don't know about her interests us the most. We know that she dropped out of college so is she using Mickey as an opportunity for herself? Does she have a right to interfere with such a tightly knit family? Some have felt that against these powerful performances Wahlberg is the weak link. I admired the restraint of his quiet performance. It works to show how controlling and dominant the rest of his family is around him. Largely, he's very contained. Most surprising is how very little boxing there is in the film. But like many of the classic boxing pictures, there are more significant and interesting things happening outside of the ring."
"Â¨I'm the one who's fighting. Not you, not you, and not you.Â¨It's a good thing Mark Wahlberg's character reminds us about this near the end of the film because you could think that he wasn't the central theme of David O. Russell's movie due to the fact that the rest of the performances from the ensemble cast outshine him. Christian Bale, Melissa Leo, and Amy Adams give such great performances that Wahlberg's character gets kind of lost in the midst of the story, but I don't think that's a negative critique for the film because it kind of summarizes the way his character has felt his entire life. Sidelined by his mother and seven sisters who have always shown preference toward his older half-brother (played by Christian Bale), who is sort of the local hero of a small town in Massachusetts called Lowell. Russell, who hadn't directed a film in 6 years (I Heart Huckabees), does a great job with the direction of this film thanks to a powerful script written by Scott Silver, Paul Tamasy, and Eric Johnson. It is based on a true story, but of course has probably been modified by Hollywood for more dramatic effects. It follows the boxing career of Â¨IrishÂ¨ Micky Ward and his rise to the top against all odds. The plot may sound familiar and sort of follows the same premise every other sport movie does, however the performance from the ensemble cast makes this movie stand out from the rest. It also has a powerful screenplay and focuses on Ward's family as much as it does with his boxing career so it makes for a good balanced dramatic sports film.The movie takes place during the 90's in Lowell, Massachusetts and opens with an HBO interview of Dicky Ecklund (Christian Bale), a former boxer known as Â¨the pride of LowellÂ¨ who once knocked down the great Sugar Ray Leonard. He lost the fight, but survived all ten rounds in the ring with him. He is a retired boxer who is now training his younger half brother, Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) along with their mother, Alice (Melissa Leo), who is his manager. Dicky's convinced that HBO is making a documentary about his comeback, but the truth of the matter is that it's about crack addiction and how it can destroy people's lives. Dicky is in his 40's and consumed by his drug addiction. He spends most of his days locked up in a friend's house getting high or in prison, although he still doesn't seem to acknowledge the fact that it's slowly ruining his life. His entire family knows about his addiction, but can't seem to help him with it. Just like the rest of the people in Lowell, Micky admires his brother and listens to everything he has to say about boxing. Micky sometimes waits hours in the gym for his brother to show up and help him train, but his addiction and time in prison is hurting Micky's career as well. His mother doesn't help him very much as his manager either as she sometime pins him up in fights against boxers who are twenty pounds heavier than him. Micky is about to give up on his career until he meets Charlene Fleming (Amy Adams), a sexy bartender who teaches him to stand up against his family and not give up on his dream. When Dicky is sentenced to 15 years in prison it is time for Micky to find a new trainer and fulfill his dream.Russell's picture received 7 nominations including Best Picture and Best Director. It had been a long time since his latest film (six years) and the wait was worth the while. His most acclaimed film up to this point had been Three Kings (in which he also worked with Wahlberg), but I have a feeling most people will remember him for this movie now on. The Fighter is a good film. It is more than just another boxing movie; it's a film about family and rising to the challenge. The film is so well balanced mixing boxing and family drama that I don't know if the title is referring to Wahlberg's character as a boxer, or Bale's character as a drug addict. Both of them have to fight extremely difficult odds in order to survive (Micky as a boxer and Dicky as a free junkie). The family also has to go through difficult times in order to survive, but somehow they manage to stick together despite all the differences. Christian Bale is truly the star of this film. He is so energetic and loud, that one wouldn't recognize this guy as being Batman or Sean Connor from the Terminator. The physical and emotional transformation he goes through in this film is just impressive. Melisa Leo (Frozen River) is also excellent in her role as Alice, as well as Amy Adams who also plays a different role in this film from what she has us used too. All three actors have been nominated for the Oscars, and Bale is a favorite to win. Wahlberg, as I said, sort of gets sidelined by the rest of the cast, but his performance is strong and powerful nonetheless. The Fighter isn't among my top ten films of the year, but it still is a very well balanced sports drama which I strongly recommend.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"The Fighter tells the story Mickey Ward, the fighter that was almost overshadowed by his brother with a drug addiction.Mark Wahlberg has never been better. He has done a few really good roles (The Departed) and a few bad ones (Max Payne) but this is what he was born to play. He's perfect as Mickey, he's masculine enough to play a fighter and a man enough to do a part like this.But for Wahlberg's bad luck, Christian Bale almost leaves him in his shadow, like his character Dickey almost leaves Mickey in his shadow. Bale is sick and disgusting as the former-boxer-now-turned-into-a-drug-addict. You really hate him and then you love him because he's that good in the part.And the ladies don't disappoint either. Amy Adams and Melissa Leo deliver great performances as the girl from the bar and as the mother.The movie is amazing and full of great performances, but it isn't a perfect movie. I found it irritating that almost 2/3 of the film is about Dickey and Mickey's relationship to him and the the last part is about Mickey and the fighting and it's over before you know it. And where is Wahlberg's Oscar Nomination?!! But in all, a great film. Worth watching and the actors are fantastic. Good film, not great"
"When the script for The Fighter ended up reaching Mark Walhberg he was demanded to make it, going through a long pre-production before it was finally made.The Fighter is the story of Micky Ward (Wahlberg), a 30-year-old welterweight boxer from Lowell, Massachusetts. He is trained by his brother, Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale) and his mum, Alice (Melissa Leo) is his manager. Micky is a boxer who never fulfilled his potential and his family have dominated his career. Dicky is also a crack addict and been followed by a documentary crew. The whole family live in the past because of Dicky's greatest achievement was knocking out Sugar Ray Leonard. After Micky was forced into a fight against a much heavier boxer he is ready to quit, especially after Dicky is arrested and the police breaks his hand. But after Micky meets a barmaid, Charlene (Amy Adams) and with the support of her and his dad (Jack McGee), Micky sets about having a comeback with his brother and mother and has a shot at being the World Title. Whilst in prison Dickey attempts to come clean and get himself back into shape.Originally Darren Aronofsky was set to direct The Fighter but in the end left so he could do Black Swan: so David O. Russell stepped in. Russell did attempt to follow some of Aronofsky's style, using hand-held cameras and looking at live in a working class urban setting, but he uses a lighter colour pallet and injects a bit of humour into the story. Moments of comedy particularly involving Micky's sisters, the next being even more ugly then last and when Dicky tries to escape his mother by jumping out a window. This is a film about family loyalty and how it could have a destructive affect, that if someone tries to do something for himself and gets advise outside the family that it is seen as an act of betrayal. Its almost like the Mitchell family in Eastenders, where every action has to done with the rest family in mind. But it shows that family does not always knows best. It is also an examination of inner city live in a run down city and general working class culture where boxing is a popular sport. It is an area that is ignored by people, where people turn to vices ranging from drink to drugs.Acting wise this was Wahlberg's dream project, but the problem is that Micky Ward is very passive character. He is a man who just gives in to his family or needs advice, he does not do any action for himself. It makes him a weak-willed hero. Wahlberg gives Micky a quiet personality and does look the part. But it is the supporting characters that are more interesting roles and do more in the way of action. Christian Bale throws his all into his role, making out that Dicky could be a joker and someone who did love his brother, but someone who could not be trusted and simply lives on past glories. He is a man who has to face up to his demons and move on with his live. Adams's character is a feisty being, someone who does not take stick from anyone. She is a tough, edgy working class woman but also fun to see in her bra and panty. Leo's character is very much a matriarch, the head of the family who loves her children but things she knows best when really she does not. She rules with almost an iron fist and it is either her way or no way. She unfairly favours Dicky despite what he does and over looks Micky's wishes and achievements. The problem is Micky disappears on screen when all these other characters are on screen and Wahlberg should had made his character stronger.When it comes the fighting screens they are well handled by Russell and he shots all the ring action like it was done by television crew. It is a bit different and allows you to see all the action. It also focuses all the action on the ring and the fight crew, with the crowd plunged in darkness.A criticism I have of the film is way the England was portrayed, with English people portrayed in the most stereotypical way possible. I haven't seen any English people dressed in old-fashion bowties and it would even less like that boxing officials would look like that. The man who plays Shea Neary, Anthony Molinari is meant to be a Liverpoolian but his accent sounds like a weird cross between Scottish and Australian. His characterisation was also handled in a clichÃ©d way, a complete bastard: this was done in many of the Rocky films and Cinderella Man with the idea of making you want to route for Ward. But we do not get to see much of Neary anyway and surely wouldn't it be more realistic that he said something like I am here to win without bad mouthing his opponent. It certainly would be different. Rant over, The Fighter is at times a little slow and does have a few too many montages, but it still an enjoyable film, particularly to anyone who likes boxing."
"David O. Russell's ""The Fighter"" recounts the early years of boxer ""Irish"" Micky Ward, played by Mark Wahlberg. His half-brother, former boxer Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale), taught him everything he knows but his drug addiction is becoming a frequent distraction. Ward also has to contend with the influence of his hard-bitten mother/manager, Alice (Melissa Leo).The film takes a few liberties with the truth in the name of dramatic license but the story is reasonably accurate for a Hollywood biopic. Anybody familiar with the real-life boxer will know how this all turns out but we end up becoming involved in the stories of the other characters as well, particularly Dicky Eklund.The screenplay ends up being an entertaining mix of sports film and character-driven drama. Eklund's drug problems and the family's conflicts make for some intriguing situations that add some gravity to what is, at heart, a conventional sports story. Bringing it all together is director David O. Russell, who garnered an Oscar nomination in the process. The film looks and sounds terrific, with authentic visuals and a tuneful soundtrack.Undoubtedly, though, the film's main strength comes in the form of the performances by Mark Wahlberg, Christian Bale & Melissa Leo. The latter two individuals recently experienced well-deserved Golden Globe wins while Wahlberg had to settle for a nomination. Bale & Leo stand a pretty good chance of repeating at the Oscars but Wahlberg was unaccountably snubbed by the academy. Amy Adams has also been getting attention for her performance but I think she's a (small) step down from the others.Ultimately, ""The Fighter"" hits the right notes for a successful sports flick while also managing to squeeze in some compelling drama. Bale's performance is one of his best ever and Wahlberg deserves praise as well. Even though it may be a bit too close to sports film convention to be considered great this film is nevertheless well worth your time."
"The Fighter which is based on a true story of 'Irish' Micky Ward (Wahlberg) a boxer who came to notoriety in the late 80's after being trained by his older brother local legend Dickie Eklund (played superbly by Bale) who's claim to fame was a title fight with Sugar Ray Robinson. The story is set in gritty working class Lowell, Massachusetts and depicts the tale of Micky Ward a could of been, almost has been boxer who is trying to break into the higher echelons of the boxing world with the help of his trainer and half brother Dickie Eklund and his mother and manager Alice Eklund (Melissa Leo).Unfortunately after his latest mismatch with a recently released prison inmate and a run in with the local law enforcement trying to save his brother from a beating at their hands Micky's right hand is broken and he is all set to give up on his dream. However after his brother is incarcerated for several criminal offences which include impersonating a police officer, Micky temporarily breaks ties with his family in order to gain another stab at his boxing dream without the help of his interfering mother and crack addicted brother. He manages to gain respect in the boxing world and is soon given the opportunity for a title bout after beating the number one contender.This is a really deft piece from David O. Russell (Three Kings) and it is in no small part down to the driving force of Mr Wahlberg who has been trying to get this movie made for about six years and serves as producer. Wahlberg trained with some of the best in the business including legendary boxer Manny Pacquiao and this shows in the boxing scenes which are strikingly realistic with Walhberg trading real blows to add authenticity to this piece. Wahlberg gives a solid performance as the would be champion whose dogged determination is akin to Walhlberg's desire to bring this story to the silver screen. The supporting cast are excellent with stand out performances from Amy Adams as Micky's devoted girlfriend and Leo as the loving and controlling mother. However it is Bale who really shines in his role as the crack addicted has been legend who grasps on to an almost forgotten past with both hands. His gritty portrayal of this down trodden character is the surprise of this movie especially as he came into the role after Brad Pitt and Matt Damon both had to turn down the role. I wouldn't be to surprised if he gets a nod in the supporting actor category with the oncoming award season upon us. The Fighter is a compelling Rockyesque story of a man who fights against the machinations of his own tawdry existence just as hard as he has to fight his opponents in the ring....true irony!!"
"""Irish"" Micky Ward was the born-and-bred boxer from the working-class Massachusetts city of Lowell who fought his way to an unlikely world championship in the year 2000. Mark Wahlberg's passion project ""The Fighter"" traces the rise of Micky from no more than a ""stepping stone"" (i.e. someone you fight with just to rise up the ranks) to his sweet victory as junior welterweight world champion. As far as boxing dramas go, this tale of an underdog who battles the odds to accomplish a shot at the big time may seem familiar, but David O'Russell's film proves that there is still plenty of punch in the genre. Russell is acutely aware that the best boxing dramas don't keep their combats confined in the ring; rather, that ringside victory is but only a metaphor of the boxer's triumph over adversity in his/her own life, and the genuine payoff for an audience emotionally vested in the character's personal struggles. So in addition to being a rousing boxing drama, this is also a psychologically complex family drama, a sweet and poignant love story, and most of all, a complicated tale of two brothers. Russell's greatest accomplishment? Weaving together all these disparate elements together into a knockout of a film. When we first meet Micky, he has just lost three fights in a row, and though his older half-brother and trainer Dicky Ecklund- whose moment of glory was once knocking down Sugar Ray Leonard- assures him that his time to shine is coming, a mismatched bout with a fighter 20 pounds heavier than him knocks out his fight. Luckily for him, a sexy and spunky bargirl, Charlene (Amy Adams), sashays into his life and helps him find the courage to accomplish his dream and remove the familial obstacles standing in his way. Russell's film thrives on these complex and thorny family dynamics- Micky's family see him as their last bastion of hope to earn some boxing cash, in particular his chain-smoking gin-drinking mom and manager Alice (Melissa Leo), whose distrust of outsiders including Charlene is as ferocious as her denial of her jewel-in-the-eye Dicky's crack addiction. Adding to the dysfunctional working-class family are seven loud and virulent sisters all stoically inclined towards Alice's opinions, amidst their cackle not one voice of reason. The verbal showdown between Charlene and Micky's exploitative female family for Micky's future is one of the beautifully staged sequences in the film, and Micky's difficult decision to free himself from their suffocating choke around his life is one of the many poignant moments here. But the heart of the story is still the fraternal relationship between Dicky and Micky, one the star of the family basking in his past glory and the other the wannabe-boxer living in his brother's shadow. Their subsequent emotional tug-of-war as Micky is forced to choose to do what's right by himself is heartrending in its brutal honesty, culminating in Micky's avowal to abandon Dicky as his trainer. Russell spends the first half emphasising the close bond between the two brothers, such that their separation and eventual reunion are easily the most affecting elements of the film. Against these troubled sentiments portrayed with a keenly felt rawness, Micky's relationship with the smart and tough Charlene who fights fearlessly against his family for his interests is a perfect counterbalance, and thanks to a terrific performance by Amy Adams, ends up tender and moving. Kudos to Adams for going beyond her usual perky type (e.g. ""Enchanted"" or ""Julie and Julia"") to play Micky's feisty other half with a will of steel- her unaffected performance will win you over right from the start. That Adams' stellar achievement in her supporting role may be so conveniently overlooked is testament to the quality of the acting on display in this film, which can be summed up in one word- phenomenal. In particular, you'll be astounded by perhaps Christian Bale's best performance to date, an exceptional accomplishment from one of the greatest character actors of our time. Bale dropped thirty pounds to play the skinny, fidgety older brother complete with receding hairline, bald spot and crack-addict teeth. It's easy to cast Dicky as the bad guy in the story, but Bale imbues him with such warmth and sensitivity that you can't help but feel immensely for his character. Bale keeps up a nervous energy about Dicky in every frame, and it is simply mesmerising to watch. On the other hand, Wahlberg has the less showy role as Micky, and though Dicky pretty much steals the first half of the movie, Russell makes it plainly clear by the second half that we- like Dicky's family- have very much been distracted by his antics. Micky is no less than the very core of the movie- it is his fighting spirit that eventually reunites the family. So while Wahlberg's performance may be low-key, it is still outstanding and counts among one of his best ever. Wahlberg's dedication to his craft is even more admirable considering how the actor started preparing for this role five years ago, building a boxing ring in his backyard, hiring two trainers on his own dime, and training hours each day to hone his skills. Beyond preparing for the role, Wahlberg's contribution to this film goes even further- when Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and subsequently Darren Aronofsky dropped out, it was Wahlberg who shaped the project from a studio film to a US$25m indie and got director David O'Russell on board. His efforts have paid off tremendously- Russell has created one of the best boxing dramas to date, a film that belongs in the league of ""Raging Bull"" and ""Rocky"". So much more than an underdog tale, this is a complex study of familial ties, the ones that strengthen and the ones that strangle. And thanks to astounding turns by Wahlberg, Bale and Adams, this ""Fighter"" is simply one of the best films of the year."
"Bale gave one of the great performances in modern film in his role as Dicky Ecklund, former contender for a world boxing title, and brother of ""Irish"" Micky Ward, the subject of this film's story. Bale was so great and Oscar-worthy in his role it is hard to believe he was not a boxer at some time in his life, as he had all the tics, moves and brain-damaged mannerisms down solid. Mark Wahlburg was quiet and competent as Ward, as he typically plays all of his roles, but the real acting kudos go to Bale, Melissa Leo as the mother of Ward and Ecklund and their seven blowsy sisters(!), and to Amy Adams as Ward's gorgeous but tough-as-nails, bartender girlfriend who supported and protected him against the specious love of his mother and brother who took every parasitic advantage of Ward to pursue their own wants at his expense. Coarse and ignorant ethnic mannerisms, speech patterns, and social behavior of that clannish Irish ghetto were so spot-on one could imagine all of the cast living their entire lives before this film in that poor, decrepit and decaying factory-town part of Lowell, Mass. They were that good.The story of the rise, fall, and rise again of Ward's boxing career was a good and involving one, made so much better due to the intertwined story of Ecklund's former boxing glory shown in stark contrast to his later life of a crack addicted, criminal loser whose job was to train his brother to be a world boxing champ but most often got derailed by his bad habit and truly pathetic friends. The harsh but loving family interplay of this big and rowdy group was the best thing in the story, as all the behavioral things that keep poor people down were shown so well here.......irresponsibility, ignorance, temper, addictions, clannishness, and a skewed view of reality and right and wrong and how to deal with all of it. A real lesson was shown in how to screw up your life, but also shown for balance was how to improve it through hard work and the love and concern of those who truly care. This outrageous family really cared for each other, hard as it was sometimes to believe, and it proved out in the end.One of the best films of the year and a true labor of love for Wahlberg, who tried for many years to get it made and finally did so in triumphant fashion. A real winner for him and for us."
"More so than boxing it's about characters and choices. Choosing which people to listen to and retain in one's life is a theme we can all relate to. And even more than boxing this movie concerns itself with the people Micky Ward chooses to have in his corner both in the ring and in life. The seemingly selfish and misguided mother and the eccentric, loony brother control Micky's destiny perhaps devastating his potential to become a great boxer. A girl comes into Micky's life who helps Micky achieve clarity and provide him with womanly support. The ultimate choice Micky makes is not predictable and that sets it apart from the clichÃ©d predictability of boxing movies.There are two character studies and as much as the movie is about Micky it is also about his brother Dicky played by Bale. The over the top, loony, egotistical, wired Dicky plays an amusing, odd-couply contrast to the mild mannered, unassuming solid Micky. He too must make a climatic decision in the movie with regards to his life and his vulnerability with drugs. These two characters play off each other as can be imagined of fighter brothers with such drastically different personalities. Despite the obvious confrontations, their hearts for each other are warmly felt. What makes this a very good movie is that you really care about the characters. Good acting from Amy Adam's loving womanliness, to Bale's charming goofiness, to Walberg's unassuming soft-spoken way create characters that represent a common Americana. The familiarity felt from these people blended with the all American setting of Lowell Mass, with its array of down-home individuals, provide us with characters that are so endearing that we can't help but to effortlessly empathize with them."
"It's easy to take a film like David O. Russell's ""The Fighter"" for granted around award season. It's minus the panache of the year's other heavy hitters, and fills a comfortable 'sports drama' niche. O. Russell's film may very well be among the ten best picture nominations announced next month, but it doesn't have a shot at the titleâ€”which is a shame, because it earns greatness in its own right.""The Fighter"" isn't the best film of the year, but it features some of the best characters and performances of the year, wrapped in a familiar but accessible underdog story with plenty of fresh hooks. Much attention has been paid to Christian Bale as boxer ""Irish"" Micky Ward's crack-addicted brother, and rightly so. Even among so talented an ensemble, Bale shines in his transformative turn, once again whittling himself down to little more than a human wireframe.Bale probably receives too much credit for his wild weight swings, which have the tendency to upstage merely passable performances, but his talent as showcased in ""The Fighter"" is incontrovertible. This is best Bale has ever been, juggling pathos with a sense of humor I presumed lost after ""American Psycho."" If ""The Fighter"" takes home one award, it'll have Christian Bale's name on it.Bale is so vibrant in his role that it's easy to forget to mention the strength of the rest of the cast; Mark Wahlberg contributes his best performance in years under O. Russell, whom he's collaborated with before on ""Three Kings"" and ""I Heart Huckabees."" As an artist, Wahlberg may be guilty of poor taste more than anything else, as he has consistently proved more than capable a performer in the right hands. The same boyish naivety that made him a perfect fit for P.T. Anderson's ""Boogie Nights"" shines through in ""The Fighter,"" which along with his physical formidability make him both believable and easy to get behind.If I have a gripe about the casting, Amy Adams might actually be a bit too attractive as Ward's love interestâ€”a small town bartender and college dropoutâ€”but her performance sells it. Also fine are Ward's destructive family, including Melissa Leo as the totalitarian matriarch, who's followed in tow by a gaggle of her fiercely protective daughters, and Jack McGee as the working-class dad who seems consistently out of his element among all the aggressive estrogen.""The Fighter"" is a terrifically acted film, but its real strength comes from the way its characters drive the story. Much of the drama comes from Ward's poisonous relationship with his mother and brother (his manager and trainer, respectively), and his having to break free of their manipulation and neglect is a decidedly unorthodox angle for a sports flick. Those relationships motivate the narrative, and the result is a drama that runs like clockwork. ""The Fighter"" is engrossing, unpretentious, and an immaculate crowd-pleaser.O. Russell and cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema (""Let the Right One In"") deserve recognition as well for giving the film its distinctive visual flair. Of particular interest is the style and method by which the pair chose to shoot their fight sequences, which achieve some of the best faux-broadcast mimicry I've ever seen. The effect is initially so convincing that I assumed actual footage had been integrated from Ward's fightsâ€”until Wahlberg stepped into the ring. From there, the camera-work is kept tight and effect is satisfying and visceral.Buzz films like ""Black Swan"" and ""127 Hours"" will likely dominate much of the awards dialogue in the coming months, but ""The Fighter"" deserves a fair shake as well. Unlike last year's condescending ""Blindside,"" David O. Russell's sports drama isn't exploitative, nor is it only receiving praise in the context of its Oscar-caliber performances. ""The Fighter"" is absolutely worth seeing, and not just for Christian Bale. It could be a contender."
"The Fighter is quite good. There aren't all that many surprises here, and those of us who â™¥ed David O. Russel's out-there Huckabees will be a little disappointed by its safeness, but it is definitely good. Quite good, even.The film's obvious standout is Christian Bale as Dicky, demonstrating his range and relevance as an affable, crack-addicted former fighter. Mark Wahlberg plays Dicky's still-fighting brother with unending restraint; he scores points for subtlety in the film's familial drama while losing as many in his charmless, unsmiling romance with Amy Adams's Charlene. There is exactly as much here as is necessary to make the film's finale engaging and rewarding, but very little to remember afterward--it really is quite successful in its predictable underdog ambitions, but it never really aims any higher.All things considered, the Fighter is almost exactly the lackluster triumph implied in its generic title and trailer--it doesn't reinvent the sport underdog story, but it isn't trying to. This movie only aims to be a quite good entry in its admittedly overaccessable genre; in that it succeeds entirely."
"Maybe 2 is too low, but I really didn't get what the film says.I was attracted by the high score and positive reviews here and convinced my girlfriend the movie is a must see. But that we are both disappointed. The movie has lousy picture and very slow speed. It put a lot of time on showing the family girls etc. and doesn't really have a focus.In my personal opinion, it should put more time on Micky instead of those other people. it should give more shots to how Micky was turned down and how Micky stood up eventually. it should be a movie giving us heart breaking and motivation. However, Mr. Russel obviously doesn't agree with me and I got nothing back.All in all, I didn't enjoy the movie at all. It is not entertaining, nor motivating. a totally waste of money and time."
"The FighterIn this true-life sports film, a boxer fights against himself and outside influences to excel against all odds and earn that elusive title shot. In other words, it's virtually identical to every other boxing movie. It's distinguishable only in that the f-word is used about three times a sentence and that Amy Adams gives an improbably iron-willed performance as Mark Wahlberg's bartender girlfriend. But overall, the movie is completely forgettable.Micky Ward (Wahlberg) is a small-time fighter from the mean streets of Lowell, Massachusetts; his older brother Dickie Eklund (Christian Bale) is a former pro who once knocked Sugar Ray Leonard down, so naturally the elder wants the younger to succeed. Trouble is, Micky not only is beset by self doubt (he's lost three fights in a row), he also has to put up with his crackhead half brother and his overbearing, greedy mother (Melissa Leo). So, again, like most other boxing films.True to form, the movie takes us through Micky's career, first as a stepping stone for other fighters and then, gradually, to the bigger time (Las Vegas and then England). The first half of the movie contains little actual fighting in a ring, then there's a boxing montage (original!) depicting several fights in the space of a couple of minutes, all leading up to the inevitable title bout. For a movie that uses so much profanity, this one was awfully dull. Hardly anything happens that isn't completely predictable. It's almost as if director David O. Russell set out to make a parody of boxing films. This movie doesn't just use clichÃ©s indiscriminately, it robs the clichÃ© bank blind. It's obvious to the audience from the get-go that Micky's family is holding him back (especially his crazy mother and addict brother), so it's no surprise when he makes the hard decision to move on without them - just as it's no surprise that somehow they wind up helping him, anyway. Part of what inhibits things is the fact that everyone surrounding Micky seems to be more caricature than character. Everyone's weird just to be weird, outlandish just to try to stand out. And none of it rings true, not for a second - except for Adams as Charlene. Now, if you've seen Amy Adams in anything, you'd be hard pressed to imagine her as a foul-mouthed barkeep who wears short shorts and low-cut tops. And yet here she is, and among all the hysterical, chaotic performances hers is the true standout. She brings a lot more depth to Charlene than anyone else does to their own roles. The worst of the lot is the otherwise-talented Melissa Leo, who plays Alice Ward as if she were the queen of harpy shrews. Alice berates everyone with a nicotine-tinged screech designed to set your teeth on edge. She also appears to be patterned directly after Linda McMahon of the WWE (and most recently a candidate for governor of Connecticut), complete with hair color and style. It's not a favorable comparison. One mistake that the movie makes concerns its identity. Is it a serious sports drama? Sometimes, yes; but other times it lapses into basic slapstick. Micky's sisters (or half sisters, I lost track) are like a coven of parrots that exist merely to be the Greek chorus of anger toward anyone they perceive as threatening their family (like, say, Charlene) or to cheerlead for Micky. When the sisters and dear ol' mom figure decide to head over to Charlene's house to scream at her, the scene quickly devolves into Keystone Kops and vaudeville. Rather than being comic relief, it's just sort of embarrassing to watch.All that aside, what really underlines the inept nature of this beast is that the lead characters aren't emotionally engaging, or engaging on any level. By the end, I didn't care if Micky Ward got his title bout, as I found him spineless and stupid and merely an average (looking) boxer. I didn't care at all about his ne'er-do-well brother Dickie, even after he's sent to jail, as I found him obnoxious and dimwitted (even though he loves his bro, surprise!). I didn't care about Alice, who spends 95% of the movie cursing people out for no good reason. It's tough caring about characters when they simply don't give you any reason to. So when bad things happen to them, you're not affected.It's often unfair to compare movies if they were released decades apart. But we can compare The Fighter with 2005's Cinderella Man, which was also based on a real-life fighter. Russell Crowe and director Ron Howard crafted a story that was plausible and filled with believable characters for whom you could root. It's not that Micky Ward isn't a good guy, it's that he lacks a personality. A personality would have gone a long way toward engaging the viewer. And, true to its clichÃ©d nature, the film tries to save itself with your garden-variety title match, akin to the Championship Game in just about every baseball movie made. I'll leave it to you to decide how it ends, although the fact that the movie is based on a true story might be a clue."
"The Fighter is directed by David O. Russell and collectively written by Scott Silver, Paul Tamasy, Eric Johnson and Keith Dorrington. It stars Mark Wahlberg, Christian Bale, Amy Adams and Melissa Leo. Music is by Michael Brook and cinematographer for the film is Hoyte van Hoytema. Film is based on the true life tale of boxer ""Irish"" Micky Ward (Wahlberg), who had to battle thru family strife to give himself a chance of achieving something in the sport.The synopsis is simple because the film is simple, but sometimes with simplicity comes great things. Such is the case with The Fighter, a boxing film that is that rare old animal of being a clichÃ© riddled sports film: yet one that's totally raw and uplifting into the bargain. The film had a long gestation period, big names such as Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, Darren Aronofsky were attached at one point, Scorsese, too, was in the frame to helm at one point, but still Wahlberg couldn't get his dream project off the ground. But all's well that ends well, for as it turned out, Russell, his director on I â™¥ Huckabees & Three Kings, stepped into the ring and with Bale now on board too, the elements were in place for a Raging Bull/Rocky of this millennium. Is The Fighter worthy of being mentioned in the same sentence as Marty & Sly's pugilistic punchers? Hell yes it is, in fact it carries the gritty tone akin to the former and the feel good factor of the latter.That Russell has managed to rise above the pitfalls of sports movie formula is an impressive achievement, more so given that this is treading the well worm path of rags-to-riches and triumph over adversity, but he is helped immeasurably by the performances of the principals in the cast. Wahlberg is the heart of the picture, physically he fits the bill anyway, but he has to play conflicted emotion to perfection, as Micky is pulled from pillar to post by all around him, to truly make Ward work. And he does. Bale, in the beginning, you feel is going to lay out a method turn reliant on another one of his punishing physical changes. Yet as the elder Ward brother-a fallen sportsman himself-now a crack addicted dope under the impression he's making a comeback-Bale manages to elicit empathy, sympathy and a request for us to root him out of his rut: quite a feat given the character's obvious fallibility's as kin. Adams as ""the girlfriend"" is spunky, brassy and tough as old boots, it's great to see her get a role so stripped down and raw it lets her showcase her dramatic talents. Rounding out the four pronged propeller of quality thesping is Leo as mother Alice. Brilliantly boisterous, angry and a maternal maelstrom of ignorant parenting, in another's hands this could have been caricature mundanity.Some missteps exist, such as relegating Adams to the back ground in the last quarter, and for sure the final fight, although well edited and potent, is far too short and rushed to 100% capitalise on the swell of support built up for Micky up to that point. But they are minor gripes, itches easily scratched at when judging the film as a whole. For this is an uplifter for our times; a sports movie that comfortably sits up at the top with the best of them. Bravo. 9.5/10"
"I loved The Fighter the first time I saw it. It probably has a lot to do with my infatuation with boxing films as a genre â€“ Raging Bull and When We Were Kings rank high in my personal movie pantheon. Russel visibly knows the canon perfectly and manages to pay tribute to all these great virile sport flicks without ending up making a pastiche. The Fighter is full of intertextuality â€“ from the font of the boxing matches' captions to the training routines â€“ it's knowingly self-referential but also playing strictly by the rules, and that's why it works so well despite what could be easily dismissed as a clichÃ©-laden script of another underdog narrative.The Fighter is based on the real life story of Mickey Ward (Mark Wahlberg), a taciturn and limited proletarian grafter very similar to Rocky Balboa (if the latter was Irish and not Italian), trained by his brother Dicky (Christian Bale) like Jake La Motta in Raging Bull. The difference here with Scorsese's classic is that the only sane and sensible character is the fighter; his dysfunctional and self- destructive family (his brother has a serious drug problem while his mom is plain greedy) become his main obstacle on his way to victory. Loyal to his family till the end, Ward wastes his best years until his brother ends up in prison for one crack stunt too many. Now in the twilight of his career, and with the help of his girlfriend, a local barmaid, and a grumpy Irish cop (played by his real-life counterpart) Mickey finds his way back to the ring and stumbles on a chance to fight for the world title, his one and only shot at glory. Will he capture it? Or just let it slip? etc. You get the idea.Christian Bale once again delivers the performance of a lifetime as the brother/coach of the title character, a local boxing legend turned crack-head. He adds a new dimension to the film, somewhat between cartoonish and pathetic, as if he came straight out of Trainspotting. His lame schemes to support his habit are hilarious, as are his friends from the crackhouse, depicted in the same warm, non-judgemental way of Danny Boyle's cult film. Bale's extravagant albeit touching portrayal is also reminiscent of Samuel L. Jackson's performance in Jungle Fever, perfectly channelling the madness of the moment under the influence of crack, while maintaining the character's humanity and integrity, avoiding to turn into a white Tyrone Biggums.In the ropes, Mark Walhberg does what he does best: toughness + Irishness. Bringing vulnerability, grit and authenticity to the film, he leaves the flamboyance to Bale, who in return happily chews the scenery. Marky Mark could have just as easily steal the show like in The Departed but chooses not to. Definitely an underrated actor â€“ mainly because he's capable of restraint.This is David O. Russel's finest movie since Three Kings, a long awaited comeback for the director who wraps it up perfectly, playing with the different takes on the pugilistic genre, from the ESPN Classic approach (the shooting of a documentary on Dicky unfolds as an important storyline within the film while offering a welcome mise-en-abÃ®me) to the Hollywoodian reconstitution and dramatisation of reality. The boxing fights, alternating inside-the-ring shots Ã  la Raging Bull and HBO's satellite coverage style, are infectiously gripping and perfectly edited. Finally, the recurring use of the song ""How You Like Me Now"" by The Heavy brings energy and coherence, appropriately opening and closing the film.Admittedly, The Fighter is nothing that we haven't seen before, and was clearly made to provide Christian Bale with a custom-made Oscar vehicle. It is no Michael Man's Ali though, and it is to the credit of the director and the cast if The Fighter still manages to pack a serious punch. A well-told sporting story will always appeal to the inside jock hibernating in most of us.ggendron.wordpress.com"
"Right now, everybody knows what's the deal with The Fighter. Everybody knows about the performance of Christian Bale. Everybody knows that he is the one who steals the film. Hell, everybody knows that he will win the Oscar for best supporting actor in a couple of weeks. He is fantastic indeed, and I will just add that for me was really remarkable how Bale gains you when the runtime of the movie doesn't even marks 10 seconds. It's great, I was like ""well everybody was right, Bale is doing something truly remarkable here"". I just loved his performance. And that clip during the closing credits showing the real-life Dicky Ward (Bale's character. He is the older brother of the main character) sort of gives *even* more value to Bale's performance as you can see that he really got Dicky. I saw this one a week ago, a week after I saw for the very first time The Basketball Diaries (1995). Two movies that might be nice companion pieces as they deal with the same subjects: sports, drug addiction and family. And Mark ""Marky Mark"" Wahlberg is in both. The Basketball Diaries goes as the one that presents the ""downfall"" kind of story and here we have a movie about the rise to success. Here the main character, Wahlberg's Micky Ward (yes, Bale steals the movie but not by much as Wahlberg is AMAZING too, making of Micky a truly great and hugely likable main character. Definitely one of the high-points of his acting career), grows in every way during the course of the picture. The problems come from the outside, well, from his very own family to be exact. There we have the ""downfall"" story with Dicky, once a local hero of boxing but now the subject of an HBO documentary about crack cocaine addiction. So there we have the drug addiction thing, the family issues. The Fighter is, as some other IMDb users have said, a crowd-pleasing picture. It's really well constructed, having characters like the ones of Melissa Leo and Amy Adams (the mother and girlfriend of Micky) that really help in order to create the kind of perfect crowd-pleasing picture: with characters you really care for and powerful moments full of emotionÂ… moments like when the little known song by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, ""Strip My Mind"" (I was like ""I know this song""! it was a really pleasant surprise to hear it here. Also, loved that the soundtrack features classic rock tunes like Led Zeppelin's ""Good Times Bad Times"" and the Rolling Stones' ""Can't You Hear Me Knocking""!), appears (when is like the new beginning for our main character) are the ones that due to the great emotion presented really got me. I'm getting really corny but, thankfully, the movie never does that. Great stuff."
The Fighter is a fascinating true story about Family. This particular family are working class Irish American and the brothers are boxers. The main interest in this film is to see an absolutely frightening method acting performance from Christian Bale that is both unnerving and Oscar worthy. He plays the elder brother who had the talent but ruined his life through addiction to crack. Wahlberg plays his younger brother who fights in the shadows of his older brother's charisma and powerful presence but finally breaks through to fight 'in Micky's corner'. The story shows the power of family ties and how they can build and destroy. Wahlberg is believable and excellent in his role and Amy Adams gives her best performance to date. The chemistry of the love story between Adams and Wahlberg's characters is really special. I am not a boxing fan but The Fighter really draws you in to the world of these two brothers and their journey together and the turmoils they overcome to find their respective paths. All the supporting actors and their performances make this film an amazing story of human frailty and the strength of family ties. It also provides a social comment about the tough world of American inner city suburbs and their 'fight' for identity. A really fantastic film and worth seeing.
Highly recommended for all The fighter is a movie which you'll love to keep in your archive. A film which you'll see again and again. for the following reasons1. A true story without changing too much or putting anything extra 2.Hats off to the director for such a natural cast 3. Acting: a movie in which you can see more than one Oscar candidates. 4. Right amount of length Christian Bale's acting is refreshing even you often wonder which one is real bale ? Bruce or Dicky ? truly great acting and worth Oscar. so everything in this film is perfect highly recommended for all specially to the fans of.. THE WRESTLER CRAZY HEART RAY etc..FOR NEWLY VIEWERS IT MAY BE LIKE BORING OR NOT WORTH SEEING BUT THIS MOVIE IS WORTH SEEING WITH YOUR FAMILY BECAUSE ITS GREAT INSPIRATIONAL STORY.
"Two brothers. First there is Dickie, a crack addict, who just also happens to be a washed up fighter, now trainer for his younger brother, who is boxer ""Irish"" Micky Ward. Then, there is Micky, a boxer who must battle his own family before he can become a legend in the ring. The Fighter is a familial drama with some sports in it, but like all of the greatest boxing movies, it is when the characters are outside of the ring that the movie wins one over.Micky's family is what one would call a convoluted battle of the wills. They do not take too kindly to outsiders, or doing things outside of the family, so it is no wonder that neither Dickie, Micky, nor their sisters are married, and you'll fully understand this when you meet their domineering mother, Alice, played to crisp perfection by Melissa Leo. Adding to the strain is Charlene, Micky's new girlfriend, played exceptionally well by Amy Adams, who sees the potential in Micky to be something great, but he must first overcome his family and become his own man if he is to be champion. Actor Mark Whalberg is the heart-and-soul of the movie as Micky Ward, and what more can anyone say about Christian Bale's no holds barred performance as Dickie. This movie is an actor's showcase, featuring some of the best acting you will see in a longtime, and I think a lot of the credit should go to director, David O. Russell.Russell shoots everything very naturally, there is a flow to it, like the human observer watching these things unfold rather than him intentionally leading us by the hand and manipulating us like so many sports movies have done. I've gotta say, the fight scenes filmed like HBO fights on television was a brilliant choice, not to mention the opening credits when Micky and Dickie walk like kings through the streets of their hometown of Lowell, Mass., these and so many other scenes are just some of the more finely crafted scenes to be projected on the big screen in a long time. In the end, the movie still manages to be uplifting and makes you wanna cheer Micky on, but you don't feel as if you were watching characters, but real people persevere and simply live, that is The Fighter's strong suit, and it is better for it.I give The Fighter a 10 out of 10!"
"The Fighter contains what is possibly the best acting ensemble of 2010. With Mark Wahlberg, Amy Adams, Christian Bale, and Melissa Leo in the central roles, you will be in for a satisfying and emotionally exhausting time. This film showcases the amazing true story of Micky Ward, a talented boxer looking for a second chance at his career. His brother Dicky used to be a talented, promising boxer himself. Unfortunately, Dicky succumbed to drug addiction and spends most of his time out smoking crack. Micky's manager mother doesn't always book him with the best opponents either for his career or health. His barmaid girlfriend Charlene is supportive but also tends to clash with him. Fortunately, he is able to get back on track and proves himself to be the talented athlete that people once knew him to be. Director David O. Russell creates a marvelous and intense drama that captivates you with each montage, acting moment, and boxing scene. The script fills each scene with raw emotion and intensity. As mentioned, the acting from all four actors is terrific. All four of them deserve Oscar nominations. Melissa Leo and Christian Bale are deservedly the favorites to win the Best Supporting Actress and Supporting Actor Oscars for their authentic and rich performances. They prove why it is often difficult to portray any real-life person. The Fighter is an extremely well-acted and rousing drama that everyone should see."
"With all of the boxing movies already out there (Ali, Million Dollar Baby, Rocky, Cinderella Man and so on and so forth) why, pray tell, do we need another? They are all essentially telling the same story. A rise to fame or a fall from glory. What more can they do with the idea? Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed The Fighter. I am not a fan of boxing in general, but I truly found myself becoming emotionally involved with the characters in this movie. There is so much heart that comes across.Our hero is Mickey Ward (Mark Wahlberg). He grew up in Lowell, Massachusetts where he learned everything he knows about boxing from his brother Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale). His mother and manager, Alice Ward (Melissa Leo) is obsessed with her boys fighting and wants them to be the greatest. After all, in his heyday, Dicky knocked down Sugar Ray Leonard. This is his big claim to fame and we hear about it at least one hundred times in the first half hour of the film. Dicky Eklund, the pride of Lowell.When Mickey is entered into a fight against someone nearly twice his size because his original opponent falls ill, he is embarrassed and walks away from everyone and everything with one exception: Charlene Fleming (Amy Adams). As someone who has seen Enchanted more times than any sane person with most of their functioning brain cells left, I had a pretty squeaky-clean image of Amy Adams in my mind. She acted the hell out of an otherwise understated role and did it with all the strength of a woman who doesn't take guff from anyone.Charlene and Mickey start dating, much to the chagrin of Mickey's sisters and mother who think she is just going to distract him. My favorite is when they dub her the ""MTV girl"" which means that she is wild. Mickey's sistersÂ… what can one say about this group of girls? With big hair, blue eye shadow, and a beer/cigarette in hand at any given moment, they are one tough crowd to please. See if you can pick out Kate O' Brien, Conan O' Brien's sister, in the group.But I digressÂ… Charlene has Mickey's best interests at heart and tries to get him back on track to becoming a great fighter and maybe winning a title. With Dicky Eklund running around and getting into all sorts of shenanigans, Mickey has to focus on himself long enough to forget about his crazy brother and get back in the ring.Christian Bale gives a spot-on performance. His likability in this film is a constant up and down. I found at one point I had genuine disdain for him. To me, this is one of the signs of a great actor. I don't know who he is in real life, though I've heard stories â€” ""No, Bruce. Let me finish."" â€” but he worked my range of emotions here and came out on top.One of my favorite characters in the film was George Ward (Jack McGee). He brings a levelheadedness to an prodigiously chaotic situation.Like I said, this movie oozes heart and is packed with tremendously talented actors. Sure to get a look from the Academy, The Fighter is one of the best from 2010.(Search mssilverscreen for more of my reviews)"
"The most haunting moment is when we finally learn why camera crews are following Dickie around.. When the camera man utters those words, that it's a film about crack addiction, I felt Dickies pain as he understood, yet forgot almost immediately because of his pursuit of his next high.. I lost an older sister to addiction, and I admit that I cried like a baby at the end of this film.. It hit on so many emotional chords, such as addiction, despair, and redemption.. And being from a large Irish family, I chuckled at the clannish behavior of the Mother and her gaggle of daughters... It was so spot on, and hilarious.. And finally, the bond between brothers, which is what this film is about..Many will want to pigeonhole Christian Bale into the Supporting Actor category, but he should win the Lead Actor Oscar for this performance.. This movie is just as much about Dickie, as Micky, and Bale's performance leaves no room for apathy.. He forces you to enter his world.. And Melissa Leo is just a great actress.. Everything she does is utterly amazing.. Marky Mark was solid, as usual, and Amy Adams is just everywhere!.. And the guy who played George (the Dad)?... Love that guy!.."
"Based on a true story of professional boxer Micky Ward, The Fighter is about how Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) fights his way of family and friends to the championship title. Dicky (Christian Bale), Micky's half-brother and trainer, is a drug addict that always fail to show up for training. Their relationship is complicated because Micky wanted more than just a crackhead brother who doesn't know what he's doing. Supporting along that line come Alice (Mellisa Leo), the brothers' mother and manager, who also wants Micky to stay with her and Dicky instead of going to someone better. After meeting the love of his life Charlene (Amy Adams), who convinced Micky that his family's no good, he decided to go on and try something else. Success with the new manager and trainer, Micky got the shot of the title match.Mark Walhberg who plays the boxer is to many critics the lowpoint of the film. Every time the camera focuses on him, it seems like he doesn't have anything to say. Perhaps the writing for Walhberg isn't as concentrated and too vague compare to his co-stars. Walhberg was suppose to carry the film with his role but instead it felt like his co-star Christian Bale did all the heavy lifting. Playing a drug addict who went to jail for resisting arrest and assaulting an officer, Bale (Dicky) was at his best. Emotionally understanding and physically confused by years of sitting on his ass, Dicky's only job was to train his brother into the championship. Bale gave up this amazing vibe that he knows what he's doing but at the same time too confused to do it right. The film, rather than focusing on Mark Walhberg, did a completely different character study on Christian Bale. Carrying along the heavy loads are Mellisa Leo and Amy Adams who played the mother and girlfriend of Walhberg. Leo and Adams had a chemistry in which both hated each other and both share the same goal of helping Dicky. Delivering explicit lines, Amy Adams is the best I've seen her in years. With two Oscar nominations already, she might even earn her third.Though the cast is above average, the writing in some parts were off. It seems like the writers wanted the actors themselves to carry the film without dialogue. They thought they can depend on the actors, but it is impossible for the actors to do any good without a solid script.David O. Russell finely crafted the film, but at times, it looked as if only the fighting scenes count. Focusing too much on the fights instead aiming to offer drama, he made the movie looked like an ESPN fight show. But set aside all of that, David O. Russell's got a talent in him and the fight scenes do look amazing. Perhaps his biggest contribution to the film is his directing of the cast.The Fighter has a predictable plot yet it pulls out so much depth offered by the cast that we can say The Fighter is finely entertaining.OscarBuzz: Best Picture (with 10 nod this year, it will be nominated), Best Supporting Actor (Christian Bale, win), Best Supporting Actress (Mellisa Leo, Amy Adams, both have a good chance), Best Score, Best Cinematography"
"Over the past decade, sports movies have, for better or worse, become virtually monopolized by Disney. Some, like Remember the Titans, Miracle and Cinderella Man (which is actually Universal/Miramax but follows in the same tradition as its Disney counterparts), are genuinely inspiring, but most feel like little more than rote exercises; you can sense the boxes being marked off: underdog protagonist, check; stern but motivating, has-been mentor, check; training montage, rising-toward-success montage, rousing speech or crowd cheering sequence during climax, check, check, check; throw in some sociopolitical issue to raise the stakes, just for good measure. It's as if they think audiences will forgive the clichÃ©d mediocrity of the whole affair just because the words ""based on a true story"" are written on the poster.The Fighter is not one of those movies. That isn't to say it doesn't follow the generic sports movie storyline, because for the most part, it does. There's the underdog protagonist, ""Irish"" Micky Ward who starts the film off by telling everyone he's going to win a fight he ultimately loses so badly he's afraid to show his face for weeks; the mentor, his half-brother Dicky Eklund who coulda been a contendah before succumbing to crack cocaine addiction; the usual string of montages, though the everyone-rallies-around-the-hero scene is thankfully absent.And yet, something about David O. Russell's latest project feels fresh, very un-sports movie-ish. Maybe it's the way he ignores the clichÃ©s, rather than attempting to avoid them, acknowledging that they're inevitable because this is, after all, based on a true story, but never embracing them. There's no swelling music during the boxing scenes (in fact, aside from some choice rock/pop ditties scattered here and there, there isn't much of a score at all), and the grainy, documentary-like cinematography gives the proceedings a refreshingly authentic feel. Maybe it's the austere yet intimate script, which revels in the grit and grime of both Lowell, Massachusetts and the world of boxing without glorifying either, unflinching in its portrayal of the story's main players.According to most, it's the cast, which is, if not the outright best part, then certainly the most celebrated aspect of The Fighter. While promoting the movie, Mark Wahlberg made his love for the subject clear, describing the work he put into getting it made and why he stuck with it even as directors and prospective costars came and went. His passion and dedication comes through in his portrayal of Micky Ward, whom he turns into less of the earnest Everyman he played in 2006's Invincible, one of the aforementioned unremarkable entries in Disney's sports movie catalog, and more into someone who boxes as much for pure survival as for enjoyment of the sport. His central conflict is not whether or not he can win the next bout, though that is also important, but whether he can find personal success without abandoning his dysfunctional but ardently loyal family; we relate to and care about his struggle, and root for him because of that.Oddly enough, of the ensemble, Wahlberg is most likely to be overlooked by viewers. Melissa Leo and Amy Adams both take radically different turns from their most well-known roles, and to great effect. Melissa Leo's Alice, Micky's mother and manager, is bossy and domineering, the sort of woman who can turn men into whimpering puppies with one glance, but taking advantage of her few emotional moments, such as one where she and Dicky sing the Bee Gees's ""I Started a Joke"", Leo humanizes her enough to prevent the Ward/Eklund matriarch from becoming a complete shrew. In comparison, Charlene initially seems demure, though we later learn she's not afraid of a fight (or a little booze). She holds her head up high because she went to college, but in truth, she's as much of a failure as any of the boorish patrons at the bar where she works. Amy Adams eschews stereotype for realism, glamour for raw honesty, and we believe her a hundred percent.The majority of attention will, no doubt, go to Christian Bale, who is guaranteed to pick up a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination, if not the win, for his work here. As Dicky Eklund, Bale delivers a performance that, while certainly demanding, seems light-hearted, almost comedic at times compared to what one might expect given the actor's propensity for intense, brooding roles. Though he physically transformed himself for the part, he wows us not by focusing on theatrical mannerisms or wallowing in melodrama the way most actors would have, but by revealing the person behind the addiction; he plays Dicky Eklund, not a drug addict. Because, in spite of everything, Eklund is one charismatic and goofy guy, and it's not hard to understand why he is still considered a local hero for beating - or ""beating"", depending on who you ask - Sugar Ray Leonard in the late '70s, rather than a local disappointment for subsequently squandering his potential. When Dicky watches a documentary he claimed was about his ""comeback"" but is instead about crack addiction with him as the main subject, honest-to-God tears sprang to my eyes; his moment of realization is almost painful to watch. What makes Christian Bale so great can be extended to the rest of the cast as well: they don't portray roles, they portray characters, people.In the end, it's a combination of all the above points that makes The Fighter work. More than anything else, it's a character-study of Micky and those involved in his search for a better life, even if that life lasts only a moment. In fact, the no-frills, relationship-centric approach arguably robs the climactic fight of a bit of its power considering that, by then, the dramatic conflicts have largely been resolved. Nonetheless, this is a great movie with strong performances, writing and direction that manages to breathe new life into a tired and trite genre. What were the odds?"
"'THE FIGHTER': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) David O. Russell directs this boxing tale based on professional boxer ""Irish"" Micky Ward 's rise to stardom and his troubled brother Dicky who helped train him. Mark Wahlberg stars as Micky and Oscar front-runner (for supporting actor) Christian Bale co-stars as Dicky. Russell is one of the most talented directors in Hollywood, his previous credits include 'THREE KINGS', 'I HEART HUCKABEES', 'FLIRTING WITH DISASTER' and 'SPANKING THE MONKEY'. Three of his five films have all co-starred Wahlberg, almost every director has a go to guy and for Russell it's apparently Wahlberg. I never used to think he had much talent as an actor but he's proved himself a little over the years (he was outstanding in 'I HEART HUCKABEES'). He's still not a great actor in my opinion and he's just OK in this film, although fittingly cast (he was much better this year in 'THE OTHER GUYS', in my opinion). It's Bale that really steals the movie and he definitely deserves all the award recognition. There's also some great supporting turns from Melissa Leo as the brothers' mother and Amy Adams as Micky's girlfriend (two other likely Oscar contenders. They were both nominated for Golden Globes, as well as Bale and surprisingly Wahlberg).Russell took over directing duties from Darren Aronofsky who took an executive producer position instead (I also saw Aronofsky's 'BLACK SWAN' right before this, so for me it was an Aronofsky double feature). I think Russell was the right man for the job and did an exceptional job, Aronofsky is an equally impressive director though and has a strikingly different style. It's interesting to think how the film might have turned out had he directed it. The film is written by Paul Tamsay, Eric Johnson, Keith Dorrington and Scott Silver (who also wrote '8 MILE'). The writing team did a great job as well; the movie is equally clever and funny as well as dramatically moving and inspiring. It's quite a unique film going experience.The film revolves around Micky's attempt to get his welterweight boxing career going. Out of love he allows his mother to manage him and his brother to train him. His brother is a former local boxing hero who went ten rounds with Sugar Ray Leonard and actually knocked him down (although some argue that he tripped). Now Dicky is a crack addict and has a film crew following him around making a documentary on crack addiction, although he tells people they're making a film on his boxing comeback. Dicky and his mother are keeping Micky down and he knows it but he doesn't have the heart to cut them loose. After falling for a local bartender and Dicky is sent to prison for his latest crime scheme Micky finally gains control of his life and his boxing career and sets up new management and enlists a new trainer, a local cop and friend (much to the disappointment of his over controlling mother). The film follows his inspiring rise to fame as he becomes a boxing hero and lifts his family out of despair.Bale's ability to transform himself from one role to another really shows in this role as he disappears into the character. While he will win the Oscar for supporting actor some argue he should be up for lead, as the film is just as much about him as Wahlberg's character (If they put him up for lead the studio knows he probably wont get it though so the safer bet is to promote him for supporting, that's how the business works). Although Bale makes the movie the entire cast is exceptional as well and like I said the directing and writing is outstanding too. The movie is a classic inspiring boxing film, one not like any you've ever seen before (although the outcome is predictable). It's definitely worth checking out and one that will be remembered for many years to come, like all of Russell's films.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsKmmH2ftXQ"
"In the midst of my work and Christmas shopping, I felt the need to catch this multi-nominated film. I am so glad I did because it is outstanding. OK, the typical ingredients of a boxing flick are here. A down-and-out underdog protagonist, the training scenes, the boxing ring scenes, the redemption towards the end. But the remarkable thing about this particular film is the fantastic acting, which can already be seen in the awards nominations already announced.The ironic thing here is that the supporting actors have more acting challenges than the main character. It is good that Mark Wahlberg (as Micky Ward) was finally nominated for his acting, but his co-stars really stole the thunder from under him. He was basically underplaying his quiet character. Unfortunately, I also felt Wahlberg was miscast, being too old to be playing a young boxer on the rise. He was very realistic during the actual boxing scenes, as though he was a real boxer. (Wahlberg's training sessions with his idol Manny Pacquiao was very evident!)Christian Bale had the showiest role as Micky's self-destructive half- brother and trainer Dicky Eklund. He was as far from his Bruce Wayne persona as can be. He was gaunt, slovenly and garrulous. Melissa Leo, wow, shines in another very showy role! She is amazingly realistic as the domineering mother of these two boxers. Her Alice was a most self- possessed, quarrelsome and hateful character as they come. Amy Adams also plays against her usual type as sassy Charlene, Micky's girlfriend who gives him back his confidence and a way out of his losing predicament. Even the more minor supporting characters were well- played: Jack Mc Gee as George Ward, Mickey O Keefe as himself, and even the seven annoying women who played the big-haired white-trashy sisters of Micky.This film is fast-paced and interesting to watch. Director David O. Russell does a very good job in helming this project. I am glad it is getting the awards consideration it is currently earning. Very sure that the three supporting actors will make it all the way to the Oscar nomination listing."
"I have been burnt so many times around Oscar time of year â€“ films that come out with a lot of fanfare and glory, films that seem very ""worthy"" but ones that ultimately don't deliver on the screen where it matters. Daniel Craig's Defiance comes to mind but there have been others. Anyway, for this reason I stayed out of the crowds for The Fighter and only got round to watching it recently. I was very pleased to find that, although not a classic, The Fighter is just a solidly great film that satisfies across the board even if it isn't the classic that some would have you believe.The plot comes from a true story and is as much about the character as it is about the sport. While the fights produce the type of energy and drama that we are used to with Hollywood sports movie it is the relationships that provide the bulk of the film and draw the viewer into the story and caring about the characters. Although some liberties are taken with facts (the final fight was in the UK, not in the US) and I'm sure the characters have been handled the same way but yet they still really engage. The family background is made up of a strong willed women and a bunch of big-haired, small-town daughters that look like snakes on the head of their mother Medusa; it is very well done and it is such a strong part of the film. The brother's battle with drugs moves along the main sporting plot really well, complimenting and working with it. Meanwhile of course the rise from nothing to having a chance to be champion is the reason we all watch sport â€“ everyone loves the underdog.The story could have been badly told or a little corny but the delivery is strong and it helps that the cast are roundly great. Although the others get the awards, it is Wahlberg that does some of the finest work. He doesn't have the mannerisms, he doesn't have the bigger character so he understates it and allows the others to work, thus being the foundation for them to be effective. Bale is tremendous; watching action blockbusters where his voice is comically deep makes you forget that he is essentially a brilliant actor. His Dicky is very real and very well drawn physically and mentally. Although Melissa Leo almost blew it with those ridiculous adverts, her performance is strong enough t overcome those for the Oscar and she does well here. Her monstrous but also well-meaning mother is great. Adams plays very much the level below these but she is still very good while the supporting cast all play their parts convincingly throughout.The Fighter is not a perfect film but it is a really great one. The sporting drama is complimented by the character drama and these two elements are all made to work thanks to strong direction, writing and of course a collection of actors who deserve every good thing said about them in this film. Ignore all the hype and awards though, just come to it as a film and I'm sure you'll be impressed by just what a roundly strong piece of story-telling it all is."
"In Lowell, Massachusetts, the HBO is filming a documentary about the life of the former boxer Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale), who is known as ""The Pride of Lowell"". Dicky knocked down Sugar Ray Leonard years ago, but now he is crack addict and the trainer of his young half-brother welterweight Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg), who is managed by their despotic mother Alice Ward (Melissa Leo) and is actually a brawler used to promote other fighters.After another defeat, due to the acceptance of Dicky and Alice of a fight against a stronger boxer weighing 10 kg more than he, the ashamed Micky meets the bartender and drop out college girl Charlene Fleming (Amy Adams) and she helps him to see that that his career will have no progress if Dicky and Alice continue to administrate it. When Dicky is sent to prison for another wrongdoing, HBO broadcasts the documentary, which is actually about crack in America and not about Dicky's career, affecting the lives of his family and friends in Lowell. Micky restarts his career with another trainer and manager and he climbs in the rank. But Dicky is released and Micky believes he is important to help him to win the World Championship, against the will of Charlene and his coach.""The Fighter"" is an extraordinary film about losers that have the chance to become winners. The entire cast has magnificent performances but Christian Bale is really awesome in the role of a junk in one of his best performances, thin like his character in the 2004 ""The Machinist"". This is the first time that I see the gorgeous Amy Adams without any glamor but she is still a very beautiful woman. The most impressive is that this dramatic story is based on a true story. Outstanding! My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""O Vencedor"" (""The Winner"")"
"Among the many excellent things about this film, the first one that struck me is just how taut the structure is. It moves hard and fast all the way through, even in the most emotional movements. This alone should make it one to study for any would-be screenwriter who would like to learn about pacing (some judiciously chosen hard-driving rock doesn't hurt). This does not in the least prevent the film from exploring some issues that go well beyond the boxing struggles that are its surface subject. This is very much about how your family can hold you back (a bit in this way like ""Million Dollar Baby""), but remain vital as your anchor nonetheless and also about negotiating competing emotional demands (demands from people who all truly love you) while eking out a clear view of your own individuality and needs. All of which could be very touch-feely and ""deep"" in another kind of film but is simply a central fact here in a narrative that never stops moving. Wahlberg does a solid, even excellent, job as the protagonist, and Amy Adams is working class tough and sexy in a way we rarely get to see, but the memorable acting here comes from Christian Bale - virtually unrecognizable even when you know who he is - and Melissa Leo, whose star has been rising so nicely since ""Frozen River"" but who has never so far as I know transformed herself so entirely as she does here to play a fierce but vulnerable working class matriarch - to the extent that I was wondering who this excellent unknown was until I saw the credits. Kudos too to the actresses playing the five sisters (not to mention wardrobe and make-up) for creating a combination Greek chorus/sight gag that is one of the film's lighter but more wonderful touches. Otherwise, to the degree that this is a boxing movie, it is an excellent one. The fight scenes are visceral and authentic, yet retain the gladiatorial nobility that lets us understand why the main characters here feel that this violent, even vicious sport offers a worthy arena for meaningful, even heroic, achievement."
"The ""Fighter"" has been nominated for six Golden Globe awards including Best Motion Picture Drama, Best Director David O. Russell and not one, not two, but four Best Actor/Actress nominations. It is one of the best films of the year staring Mark Wahlberg (Nominated for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Drama) and Christian Bale (Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture Drama) as brothers Mickey Ward and Dicky Eklund who embark together on a boxing journey to become ""The Pride of Lowell"", Massachusetts. The film begins with the two brother's being interviewed in 1993 and flashing back to tell the story. Before his crack addiction, Dicky was known for knocking out boxing legend Sugar Ray in his hay day. He has always looked out for his younger brother Mickey and has trained him to be a boxer as well. However, Mickey is on a losing streak and is down on his luck. He has a large family that is part of the boxing business. His mother, Alice Ward (Melissa Leo, Nominated for Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture Drama), is Mickey's manager while his father George Ward (Jack McGee) tries to help him get a better manager and make him some more money. Mickey's luck is turned around when he starts dating a bartender named Charlene Fleming (Amy Adams, Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture Drama) dragging her into the family business. Everything comes together as the fight for kinship begins as Mickey, Dicky, Alice, Jack and Charlene work to restore the family name and celebrate in Mickey's Corner. ""The Fighter"" is all about the acting performances of the best ensemble cast of the year. Wahlberg, Bale, Leo, and Adams are raiding all of the spots for the acting nominations at every awards show. The four cast members mentioned along with Jack McGee have been nominated as a whole for two best ensemble cast awards and have won one already. With this being said the best part of the movie is Christian Bale's portrayal of Dicky Ecklund. He lost a ridiculous amount of weight for the role for the second time in his acting career (""The Machinist"", 2004) weighing the least he has in years at 121 pounds. Bale has always been an amazing actor being able to break away from his strong English accent to play American characters with a flawless American accent. He is completely different than you have ever seen him before and hands down is going to pick up numerous awards this awards season including the Oscar. All of these performances create the originality of the film from a well- known plot line.The story starts out very slow taking 30 or 40 minutes to kick into full swing. The screenplay is very well written and performed, however, the film is still very predictable. The plot has been used over and over again must memorably in the ""Rocky"" franchise. The film is very straightforward and does not have any surprises along the way, but in the end does this really matter?""The Fighter"" is a very enjoyable movie that is easy to enjoy. Lead by the best acting of the year the film has set the standard for ensemble casts of the future by telling a real life ""Rocky"" story that you need to see now!"
"Contender For The Oscars. A story about a talented fighter with a shaky start with family in some cases making wrong decisions and a half brother/trainer on crack, Micky Ward rises up to become Americas working class hero. The perfect exact role for Mark Wahlberg (Micky Ward). The adaption from the real story and the actors who portrayed them are incredibly very close. All movies similar in sense like, INVICTUS, BLIND SIDE, RAY, ETC, Have all been recognized for consideration by the Oscars. This movie should be considered as well. Class movie, actors, and story. Privileged to see the sneak preview at the AFI 2010 FILM FESTIVAL. A true story of a people's fighter"
"I've lived in Lowell, Massachusetts for about a year and a half. Micky Ward is a legend around here and this movie does his august reputation justice. The story is beautifully told, and, as a life time Bay-Stater, I can safely say this movie presents the most accurate picture of the people of Massachusetts I've ever seen. It has everything the great boxing movies have, just with the Irish ""go f--- yourself"" attitude that makes Mass. so entertaining. Whalberg is fantastic, Bale should take home an Oscar and Amy Adams is nothing short of mesmerizing. Daivd O. Russell's direction is fantastic. The movie is fast paced, beautifully and has a great soundtrack that will make you want to box someone as soon as you leave the theater. The Fighter is heart-warming, inspiring, funny and a great way to spend two hours."
"I'll start with the positive. Good production values and some decent cinematography but all in all it was just a very run of the mill predictable film. All the stereotypes are there, guy at the lowest point of his life, works his way up, has family problems, work on his personal life and professional life and is a great success. I thought Christian Bale put a decent effort in, but even with all that weight loss the performance just wasn't believable. One other good thing that I thought was good(for those who think I am being unfair) was the dialogue. It sounded very believable and real. I just didn't care for the characters, they were far too cardboard and out of a storyboard.Honestly, you can guess what happens next. No, I didn't miss the point of this movie."
"Yes, 1 out of 10. Really was expecting this to be better, judging by Whalbergs past performances (BN, 4 brothers), but this is a BAD movie.Very slow for first hour, no deep characters to follow or care for, lots of shouting women, bad fight scenes, token romance story, brother does drugs and goes to jail and redeems himself...blah blah blah... How the posters can state this as ""the best boxing movie since rocky"" is a mystery to me. Avoid at all costs, DON'T waste your money!UPDATE: How are there only 3 reviews, so far, which gave this film 1 star? Many more people should be rating this lower than what they are. Are they paid by big production co's to write these reviews? surely not! See thru the BS everyone, this movie is not worthy of the praise it is getting!"
"Finally after weeks of wanting to watch this movie, i had the chance to do so, specially after watching all of this years big anticipated Hollywood blockbusters that has 8+ rating on here.Overall its a good movie, but not what was expected of it, The Movie revolves about Ward's (Mark Wahlberg) Life. which is nice and very dramatic. the thing you wouldn't expect in a boxing movie. the fights are rare, the build up of the story is quit slow that leaves you a bit bored an hour into the movie.The only thing that entertained and lifted the movie to its high expectations is Christian Bale, WOW!!, a golden globe nomination performance. without him & his character this movie wouldn't be this special.In the end i do recommend this movie to boxing fans & A MUST to Christian Bale's lovers, but don't expect anything like Cinderella Man."
"Not wrote a review before on IMD but felt after watching this movie that i had to. Lets start by saying i'm not a fan of Mr Bale i find his real persona at times colours my feelings of his movie roles not the case with the fighter quite simply he deserves the Oscar for Supporting Role as does Amy Adams and Melissa Leo its a shame they cant both get it although there have been ties in the past.From the opening scenes taking the viewer through the HBO filming of Dickys comeback to the end titles its pure dramatic joy, the scenes of family life with the Ward / Eklunds are pure fly on the wall type viewing. Quite simply an excellent movie even if you hate boxing you will enjoy the Drama."
"Mark Wahlberg keeps up to as the brother and aspiring boxer. Amy Adams was great as Mark's girlfriend, and the entire supporting cast was pitch perfect. How did they ever cast the family? One gets the impression they were real life & not actors. The mother and her brood of harpie daughters were the roughest bunch of females ever to appear in a movie that wasn't science fiction. You could definitely see how they were cut from the same mold as Bale's character but Wahlberg's character seemed too decent to be from that group of people.You wonder who gets the nod for best actor in this film. Wahlberg or Bale? Bale's character might seem to be confined to a supporting actor nod but Bale made the film a great one and if it wins best picture (which seems like a good bet), Bale would seem to be inline to get most of the credit.Anyway, a great picture, not to be missed. Quite possibly one of the best boxing films ever made. And Bale's performance was one for the ages."
"The Fighter is based on the true story of Mickey Ward, who hopes to become a boxer as his older brother Dicky used to be quite good and was even in a huge fight on television that earned him a lot of respect. Dicky now these many years later is a crack addict and also Mickey's trainer, but he can never get to their training sessions on time and also a lot of the time he is burned out and oblivious to what is going on around him. Mickey's mother Alice, is his manager, but so far Mickey's fights haven't been all that successful and he longs for more. After meeting a feisty bar waitress named Charlene, she gives Mickey confidence and helps analyze the situation and helps him realize his true potential to become a champion fighter, but if he is to be successful he may have to do it without his family behind him because as Charlene sees it, they are holding him back more than anything and not really helping. The Fighter is a movie about boxing as I said above and about someone trying to become a boxer, but you do not have to know anything about the sport of boxing to enjoy this movie because that is only one aspect of the story. I personally am not really into sports, so if this film had just been a lot of sports manoeuvres and long drawn out boxing matches, I can imagine that it would not have been for me, but the way they put it together made me love what I was watching and earned a huge amount of respect from me after I had watched it. Mickey grew up in a rough side of town with seven sisters, a crack addicted brother who is continually getting into different forms of trouble and they just live a different type of lifestyle. They smoke and swear continuously and there is a great amount of dysfunction in this family. I am glad that this film did not shy away from those parts, but instead focused on them and made them an important part of the story. Yes at times the film is quite gritty and earthy and even at times disturbing, but it feels real and generates real emotion in us the viewers. If this had been a big glamorous Hollywood project with big production values and everything a little more flashy and slick I could not have seen the film having the same impact that it does now the way they did it. We also get to see the family interact and although there is so much dysfunction and even a bit of greed in them, I think deep down they do really want what is best for each other, but they just have to find that out first and discover it inside themselves. The story here is terrific. It gives us great character depth and study of all the main characters and does what I like best in these type of films, when they show the heroes, or main characters of these films and do not cover up their flaws and weaknesses, but instead put them on display and work with those elements to further enhance the story and make it believable. The film has a great pace and is absolutely riveting to watching. The direction is handled very well here as is the screenplay and it comes off beautifully from these top notch actors and their performances. Everyone is so good in this film in the different roles and personas they have to portray. For example, Christian Bale really gets into the look and the face and body language of a drug addict and at times it looks a little interesting, but he also shows us how tragic it is and that we really need to care for this character and all the emotion and work he puts into this performance is brilliant. I think of all the films I have seen Christian Bale in thus far, I would go as far as to say that this is so far his best performance in what will be a very long career. Also do not be surprised if he wins a Supporting Actor Oscar next year because he is truly deserving and I can not think of too many other male performances this year that were just as good, or even better. The supporting cast is all great here as well and also deserving of praise. This film will draw you in, fascinate you and take you on a roller coaster of emotions, but it is one you will be glad you went to see. Along with The Social Network, The Fighter is so far the best American film I have seen of 2010. Granted, I still have a lot to see, but this is a perfect film and in boxing terms a real knock out. Go see it at once."
"Unlike most of the IMDb reviewers, I did not like The Fighter. Perhaps if I had read the book or even read some of these reviews so I knew some of the background, I'd have understood it better--but I still would have wondered why anyone thought this movie needed to be made.Haven't there been enough movies about underdog boxers who persevered until they came out on top? Haven't there been enough movies about drug addiction--and don't most of them make it plain right away that the addict is addicted, not the victim of having been hit a few too many times in the head? Haven't there been enough movies about overbearing, controlling mothers who would sacrifice their children if doing so suited their purposes? Haven't there been enough movies about dysfunctional families that are unemployed and just sit around the house minding each other's business? Rolling them into one movie does not a ""fresh"" approach make.The redeeming feature of this film is the cast. Melissa Leo and Christian Bale take turns chewing the scenery. One of the recurring ""jokes""--when ""Dicky"" dives out of the window (of what I found out too late to appreciate it was a crack house--I thought his racist mother objected to his having an Asian girlfriend) into the dumpster--provided some humanity to their characters. Their leaving the scene while singing ""I Started a Joke"" provided the most poignant moment in their on-screen relationship. Mark Wahlberg was much more understated, by contrast, to the point that my companion opined that ""He was just playing himself."" Amy Adams was spot-on with her portrayal of the hurt-to-the-core-but-still-spunky bartender cum girlfriend. Their scene with ""Micky's"" daughter provided their opportunity to show a human soft side. The exception is the ""seven sisters,"" who were like a Greek chorus. I cringe to contemplate what the original Eklund/Ward sisters thought of the way they were portrayed on the screen.Christian Bale looks much older than his actual age in this film, and he apparently lost a huge amount of weight again (after doing so for The Machinist). I hope he wins enough awards for this film to satisfy his ambition before he permanently damages his health! I never could identify with any of the characters in The Fighter. I could never actually like any of them--they were either shrill, whacked out, displaying their worst behavior, committing crimes with nothing to redeem them, or generally providing a negative demeanor--so I never cared one way or the other about any of them. Considering that so many people found the movie entertaining, I have spent a lot of time analyzing why that was not true for me, and I have to conclude that the Eklund/Ward family is like a train wreck. It's awful, but a lot of people want to see every awful moment of it."
"Lots of boxing films have been made over the years, some that are done well and make for great entertainment based purely on the script/storyline, this film does not fit in to that category. I never at any point of this film felt like I was drawn in to the story, and it never makes you feel part of the story being told, the acting is poor, and why did they cast Bale? He is over rated and I find him annoying to watch as an actor. It was a real drag to watch this till the end, and I was glad when it ended, poorly directed, sub standard acting makes this film a real disappointment.3 out of 10"
"The Fighter is one of those films that after you watch it you feel almost that you lived it. It has a quality very few films have. Some films like Diary of a Wimpy Kid and Sex and the City 2 make you feel like you're watching a poorly written film or are just staring at characters that you have no desire to watch. The Fighter has the right amount of intensity, realism (which it should), and a great cast to seal the deal.While I haven't seen The King's Speech, I can say Colin Firth has some hefty competition as he better win me over as Prince Albert. Because as of now, its looking like Wahlberg should've deserved it. My goal is to watch all the Best Picture nominees of The Oscars before June, my set deadline. Franco was good, Eisenberg was great, but Wahlberg is a character in this film.The plot: Welterweight boxer Mickey Ward (Wahlberg) struggles to make a name for himself as he tries to fight his way to fame. His big mouthed, former crackhead brother Dicky (Bale) is his trainer and his mother, played by the fabulous, well deserving Oscar winner Melissa Leo is his manager.Mickey is constantly babied and spoon-fed by his mother who feels that if someone isn't family they're not worth their time. Her personality comes forth when Mickey is offered to be trained in Vegas. Of course anyone would jump at the opportunity, but Mickey's uptight family (with the exception of his dad) refuses to let him.That is until Mickey meets a lovely young bartender named Charlene (Adams) who is Mickey's girlfriend. She encourages him to stand up for what he wants to do, only to be named ""an MTV girl"" by Mickey's nine sisters.It's a thrill I got to see The Fighter for a low price on Xbox Live's Zune. It's something that is well worthy of the title ""a must see film."" The end was a tiny bit disappointing, but not everything is perfect. Everything has a flaw. I cheered a little for Mickey, but I felt that something else should've happened at the end. Like Raging Bull had a little bit of a ""wow"" moment at the end. The Fighter doesn't have an ending that is truly shocking.Regardless, it doesn't drag the film down a whole lot. Wahlberg is fantastic, Bale is wonderful, Leo is powerful, just powerful, and Adams is one of the strongest female leads of 2010. She gets into her role as Charlene and just hits everything spot on. It seems after doing bad romantic comedies she finally hit the jackpot.Director David O. Russell's documents one of the most gripping fighting films in my recent memory, and ranks up with Scorsese's Raging Bull. The action on screen is great and The Fighter is an all around enjoyment.Starring: Mark Wahlberg, Christian Bale, Melissa Leo, and Amy Adams. Directed by: David O. Russell."
