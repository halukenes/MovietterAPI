"Please don't read this if you don't want the ending given away.I've noticed a lot of people complaining that the ending spoils the film and is clichéd because the underdog and not the better fighter wins.I'm not suggesting that my interpretation is the right one but my view is somewhat different than the one some people hold. It is perfectly logical to point out that Brendan had hard fights to get to the final and that he would probably have been exhausted and that Tommy has had a much easier route.However, the point is that he made that route easier because of his rage. Tommy is only the more destructive force because of that. His demons are driving him on because he is lost. He cannot or will not reach out to connect with his father or brother. The point is that the dam is broken when he sees his father in the hotel room raging against Ahab. This is deeply symbolic. I think you are meant to draw the connection with Ahab who was driven by his own rage with the rage of the father which destroyed his family to the rage which Tommy now feels. Even though he is drunk it is no coincidence that his father refers to Tommy as Ahab and bellows at him to stop the ship. At the point that Tommy takes him in his arms and holds him he begins the healing process but loses what makes him such a formidable fighter. Thus he is simply unable to blow his brother away in the way that he has done to every other opponent.The other crucial point (and you would have to be a younger brother to fully get this one) is that Tommy doesn't really want to beat his brother at that point. He needs to know that his brother loves him and perhaps that he regrets not reaching out to him when they were younger. The fact that he taps out only at the point when Brendan says he loves him is significant as is the fact that he breaks down in the corner before the final round. Had he still been carrying his rage he would surely rather have been rendered unconscious than submit.In other words, for me it was the perfect ending and the more you think about the film the more profound it seems.All in my view of course. Which could be a load of old rubbish."
"Just saw a sneak peek of Warrior. All I can saw is WOW! Great film. Great performances. The characters are deep and believable and the story will probably have you leaving the theater in tears.The fight scenes were done really well. I've been cage side at hundreds of MMA fights as a photographer and believe me when I say this is some of the most realistically portrayed MMA action I've seen to date on film. Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton, Jennifer Morrison and Nick Nolte all give good performances and I think Nick Nolte had a couple of moments in the film that should be considered Oscar worthy.I know a lot of people won't agree with me on this and I can understand, but Warrior has bumped Rocky out of my top 5 favorite movies of all time. IMHO (which some of you will consider worthless) I think it's that good."
"My girlfriend took me to an advance screening of Warrior because I'm an MMA enthusiast. She told me she did not expect much. She ended up leaving the theater in tears.The fighting in the movie is almost an after thought. What the movie is really about is a broken family trying to get on with their lives. You have a recently sober father trying to earn the forgiveness of his sons for destroying his family years earlier, one son trying to provide for his wife and children, and the other son trying to earn money for the family of his friend and fellow Marine who died overseas. All of it comes together seamlessly and provides for a truly gripping movie.It's emotional without being sappy. It's funny without being goofy. It's inspirational without going over the top. It's hard to say anything bad about it. Even if you have no interest in martial arts, you will get something out of this movie.I highly recommend this movie for men AND women, fight fans and average Joes alike."
"Every so often you'll come across a combat sport movie that manages to find just the right balance of drama and action – that is, more drama than action. When fights are justified with backstories full of crushing emotion, they become all the more intense and gratifying. Warrior brings to the table the world of mixed martial arts, where punches, kicks, holds, and everything else goes. The inception of new international tournament ""Sparta"" puts on a collision course Paddy (Nick Nolte), Brendan (Joel Edgerton), and Tom Conlon (Tom Hardy), all part of an estranged family torn apart in the past by abuse, favoritism, and abandonment. Tom resurfaces in society to enlist the help of his formerly alcoholic father Paddy to train him for the tournament, while at the same time Brendan revisits his UFC training in hopes to win the $5 million purse for his struggling family. The two underdogs face some of the toughest MMA fighters on the planet, but the true struggle appears to lie within them. Paddy battles for forgiveness against the resentment of his sons, Tom fights to prove to himself that he is strong, and Brendan struggles to come to terms with his older family while trying to support one of his own.The fantastic thing here is two protagonists entering the same tournament. Each brother has his own respectable reasons for fighting, a fact that is sure to divide the audience when it comes time to choose which one to root for. The story truly is gut-wrenchingly powerful and presented in an engaging fashion. Little by little through the film's dialogue, we are allowed a glimpse into the past hardships of the Conlon family, and the characters' motivations for retaining such hatred are revealed gradually. Through the incredible acting talents of Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton, and Nick Nolte, this confused and passionate chemistry really comes alive. All three actors put up some of the most convincing and heartbreaking performances of their careers; and seeing as how The Fighter garnered so many Oscar nominations, I can't see why Warrior will not do the same. My only beef with the movie is its clichéd climax and rather bleak inconclusive ending, though it still does good to the emotional schism the movie intended to create. Warrior is one of those sports films with a magical mixture of emotional and physical battle. It's a wonderful story showing how sometimes the world's strongest forces are insignificant in comparison to the troubles of a scarred family. Warrior is without a doubt worth a visit to the theater. One of the best of 2011! And whether you're an MMA fan or not, the adrenaline-pumping fights will have you up and cheering and applauding.9/10"
"This movie is truly, truly OUTSTANDING! I am in complete shock over the performances in this film. Nick Nolte, as usual, gives a gritty, gut wrenching, emotional performance that left me buckling at the knees. One of my all time favorite movies of Mr. Nolte was Rich Man, Poor Man, absolutely a god given talent! The performances of Mr. Hardy and Mr. Edgeron were academy award winning, I would love to see more of them by far! I cried throughout the movie, and when it was over, I could not wait to tell everyone about it. A terrific ensemble cast and movie that certainly should be up for Best Picture!! A definitive Oscar nod for Nick Nolte, and if it were up to me, Mr. Hardy and Mr. Edgeron would walk away with one as well! If you have not seen this movie, drop what you are doing, run to your nearest theater. This movie is truly what being a performer is all about! My hat is off to you all!!!"
"Grab your popcorn, buy your soda..and get ready for a great movie.From start to finish, this movie will have you hooked. There is no weak spot in this movie. The acting is amazing. The story is great. The music is catchy. You will get emotionally invested throughout this story.This movie will make you FEEL something. This movie will ENTERTAIN you.This film has great drama, action, and story. I walked out of the movie being so impressed, and in shock how this hadn't gotten more attention or done better at the box office.This movie is a MUST SEE. And I'm pretty picky. Enjoy."
"OK, Lets talk about the the big pink elephant in the room first. Yes, the movie has a similar storyline from movies of the past. And yes, it may be, to some, ""just another fight movie. However, Warrior has the audacity to challenge the cliché's and still manages to stand out from the rest. Bottom line, Warrior is a well written and directed emotional roller coaster that will have you at the edge of your seat. With a star studded cast and top notch acting, the performances were solid and believable. Nick Nolte in particular did a fantastic job with his role and will have you nearly in tears. As the movie progresses you will be torn on what you would like to see happen for the climax of this entertaining thrill ride. Movies with this much emotional power connected to the characters only come around every once in a while. Go see this movie to finish off the summer or forever regret not supporting what is sure to be a classic!"
"I had the pleasure of watching this movie last night. I went since its a ""guy"" movie my husband was the one excited about it more than I was. I must say I was more than impressed with the leading men in this film. It has been a long time since a movie has had me on the edge of my seat, biting my nails as this movie did during the fighting scenes. If you are looking for great acting, family drama, awesome fighting scenes than this is the movie for you. After we left the theater we couldn't stop talking about it. I will definitely go see it again when it comes out. We really enjoyed it! Nick Nolte was amazing, and even my husband I think cried in a few scenes, (last time that happened was during Marley and Me) so I must say this movie is a MUST SEE!"
"I had the pleasure of seeing Warrior at 2011 CinemaCon, walking in not knowing a thing about the movie, other than it was a movie about 'fighting.' And though a MMA movie (Mixed Martial Arts), not boxing, per se, for the genre, fighting, Warrior delivers a much better story than The Fighter, and is on par with Clint Eastwood's Oscar winner, Million Dollar Baby.Expect a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nod in 2012 for Nick Nolte. And superstar status for Tom Hardy.Warrior, though a work of fiction, plays out like a true story; two brothers at odds with each other and their father, in the town of Pittsburgh, who resort to prize fighting, one for the money, the other to prove himself a man."
"The official trailer itself is a little bit of a spoiler. I didn't even have an IMDb account and made one just to rate this movie. One of the best iv ever seen. First movie iv ever cried during, and i cried twice lol. Whether your a guy who likes fighting movies or a girl who doesn't know what MMA stands for, this movie will blow you away. Seriously, I don't know how anyone could watch this and think it wasn't at the very least, a Very Good movie. It kept me on the edge of my seat, and its also more realistic the most fighting movies. Watching rocky and most box office fighting films, there tends to be over-dramatized punching noises and the boxers seem to fight without attempting to guard themselves. Aside from the realistic fight however, is a very emotional drama which is sure to move anyone who pays attention to the film."
"Over the past few years we've been receiving quite a lump sum of MMA movies due to the rise of the sport. But movies like Never back down, and fighting just doesn't cut it with their cliché man against man rivalry, with their over the top inaccurate MMA-like action. Then there came Warrior. Was it just another MMA movie with over the top hardcore action? Well lets find out.What pulled me into the movie at first was the trailer. The trailer didn't have hardcore rock or scenes of ""You're not the best around here you can't beat me"" shenanigans. It had the sense of two brothers trying to solve their own problems while trying to deal with each other and their former alcoholic father through the use of a huge MMA tournament named Sparta. In which revealed in the trailer they eventually have to face each other.The story of Warrior although is very MMA suited, you will see about more drama than there is action. Not that there is a problem with that, but it's always great to see how everything unfolds. A former MMA fighter now Physics teacher Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) faces financial problems with his house and is slowly getting back into the mix by competing in underground fights. But the education system finds out about his antics, thus for he is suspended without pay. So he uses this to train full time, and compete in Sparta. Whereas former Marine Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) a war hero who is suffering through PTSD, decides he wants to fight in Sparta to give the prize money to the family of his fallen friend. Then there is the father Paddy (Nick Nolte) a former alcoholic who is trying to reach out for his sons for forgiveness of being a family wreck. Who in return is being used as Tommy's trainer, bet is being neglected by him as well. Then Brendan although neglecting him as well, is trying to deal with his own problems and has no time for him.As for the fight scenes of the movie, I can say I am an experienced Martial artist I've trained in several styles. Although I am not a pro MMA fighter yet, I've watched enough fights to actually comprehend how MMA fights are like and the rules and whatnot. Warrior has put in really great choreography of an authentic MMA fight. It was as if I was watching real fights on the big screen. Although there were some over the top moves here and there, most of the techniques portrayed in Warrior are applicable in a real life combat situation.The performance and screenplay, all were simply amazing. Tom Hardy's performance was astounding, as so was Nick Nolte's. The appearances of Nate Marquardt (UFC), Anthony Johnson(UFC), Erik Apple(Strikeforce), Roan Carneiro(Freelance) and Kurt Angle(TNA) did a really good job being actors of the movie while being able to retain their athletic ability of being professional athletes in combat sports.The movie had a unique way making you feel absorbed into the movie, getting to know the characters and feeling attached to them emotionally. Warrior is an emotional roller coaster that will make you laugh, really tense, and even leaving the theater in tears. Whether you are the MMA athlete, fan, trainer, enthusiast or an average movie goer, This movie is for you. Definitely one of the best movies I've seen this year."
"""Warrior"" may be one of the best movies of the year that no one sees. That in itself is puzzling. Mixed martial arts and UFC are in the cultural mainstream; in fact MMA is more popular than professional boxing. Director and writer Gavin O'Connor did the amazing ""Miracle"" a few years back about the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team. So he has the touch for inspirational sports stories. In ""Warrior"" estranged brothers Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) and Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) fight each other in the finals of the winner take all mixed martial arts tournament Sparta in Atlantic City. ""Warrior"" is an inspired story of family, honor, and redemption. I applauded at the end of the movie along with the rest of the audience.""Warrior"" is a paradox of styles as inspired by its leads. Tommy (Hardy) is the AWOL Marine war hero from Afghanistan. He literally tore off a submerged tank door, saving those inside. Tommy plows through opponents with sheer rage and power. He is explosive technique. We witness this as he savagely dismantles world middle weight contender ""Mad Dog"" Grimes (cocky Erik Apple) with kicks, punches, and throws in an impromptu sparring session. Tommy mysteriously appears at his Dad's door step in Pittsburgh. He blames Paddy (powerful and sublime Nick Nolte) for the death of his mother. Brendan (Edgerton) is the high school physics teacher and former UFC fighter. He and his wife Tess (strong Jennifer Morrison) work several jobs to pay their upside down mortgage. Brendan gets an entry into Sparta to save his family home. He is smart and willing to take punishment to leverage his opponent's mistakes—getting a tap out. Brendan like Tommy has no love for their recovered drunk Dad (Nolte).At the narrative arc Brendan says to Tommy, ""I love you!"" And neither will back down. I think O'Connor and writers Anthony Tambakis and Cliff Dorfman at times overstate the family dysfunction. ""Warrior"" could have been leaner, as strange as that sounds. The mixed martial arts fighting are world class and many of the fighters are MMA stars. Former professional wrestling champion Kurt Angle is fierce and dominating as Russian champ Koba. His match with Brendan is vicious and amazing. ""Warrior"" authentically gets the brutality and precision of mixed martial arts. Hardy and Edgerton are awesome. I read that Hardy trained intensely gaining 30 pounds of muscle. He broke ribs and fingers. Edgerton tore his knee out during the shoot.""Warrior"" has a gritty atmosphere that is all about character and adversity. O'Connor seamlessly captures this in the simple camera shots and intimate dialog. He generates amazing performances. Edgerton is the delicate balance of compassion and focus. His Brendan is a good and decent man. Hardy has an electrifying enigmatic presence. He provokes a painful sadness and rage in Tommy, for whom honor and family are everything. Nick Nolte poignantly plays their broken father, who is pivotal in the redemption of his sons. Ultimately, ""Warrior"" is about forgiveness and love. It is one of the year's best."
"This is not your typical fighting movie. This movie has so much emotion and meaning built into it that it's able to overcome what we're all used to seeing from MMA films and other sport dramas. Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton and Nick Nolte deliver powerhouse performances that are all deserving of reward recognition. I may be biased because I was involved in martial arts for most of my life so I connect to the sports aspect of the film more than other movies about sports but to me, this movie is something that needs to be watched as there is so much more to this than your typical sports drama. This is now my favorite movie of all time and I hope that you all decide to check it out!"
"I was lucky enough to catch Warrior at Empire's Big Screen at the O2 in London last week as one of their secret screenings and I have to say it was a very pleasant surprise. It seems it wasn't just me either, eves-dropping on rest of the audience as we left revealed there was an all round endorsement by the crowd. Funnily many of the conversations would begin 'I wouldn't usually go and see a film like that but' which I can certainly second. I will also avoid spoilers here as I went into this completely unaware and certainly benefited from it.The film follows two fighters and their families as they enter the big bucks mixed martial arts (MMA) competition, Sparta. It has the usual balance of down on his luck good guy doing it for the family (Joel Edgerton) and a seemingly brutal fighter who is looking for a payday (the suddenly ubiquitous Tom Hardy). Throw in Nick Nolte as a sad, reformed drunk of a father and we have the basic elements of another run of the mill sporting movie. Or at least that's how it starts. It doesn't particularly throw any curve balls to be honest but it does unfold interestingly and we are not given the whole story on a plate which was refreshing. It examines family relationships and regret and faces the terrible truths when some wounds just cannot be healed by forgiveness once it is too late.It's not all family drama though and unsurprisingly it does have a hellova lot of fighting in so even though I think it is enjoyable for most if you can't stomach the violence then don't bother with it. However the fighting is well balanced within the narrative, excellently shot and excitingly edited so we do not get the cliché slow-mo or the epic hour long battle even for the big finale. Some of the fights are brutally quick and even those that go the distance are edited down very well indeed while maintaining that punishing feeling - they certainly had the audience ooomph'ing and wincing along with every slam and punch. There will be blood along with some horrible curdling crunches too.Aside form the action Rocky (1976) and The Wrestler (2008) seemed to be more about the individual and their demons and while there are elements of that here it really focuses on the (dysfunctional) family drama. Of course it is going to get the obvious comparisons to The Fighter (2010) but I don't think it's a bad thing and that should really be taken as a compliment. I would not be surprised to see it picking up a few awards along the way too. Even if one was to compare the two I think Warrior stands up very well and having the film follow two fighters marks it apart. Like the fighter though the two leads are outstanding and worthy of all the attention they will receive for them. Performances are impressive across the board in fact and it's wonderful to see Nick Nolte back in the frame with a delightful role that he seems to slip perfectly into. (A sorry ex-drunk with a history of violence - apologies Nick!) As well as their acting performances the two main characters are to be complimented on their believable appearance as fighters with some impressive physique on display. Both of our fighters here are easily as believable as the muscled yet high pitched and whiny Wahlberg and certainly must have done a fair bit of training for the role too. Although that wouldn't really be a surprise for anyone that has seen Hardy in Bronson (2008) most will know him from his turn in Inception (2010) which is something completely different. Joel Edgerton too looks different from the roles I remember him in – Kinky Boots (2005) and Animal Kingdom (2010) - as well as his Uncle Owen turn mean this is another impressive transformation.As much as I love this film there are a few gripes as there always has to be (sorry I've yet to find a 10/10 film!). Props to director Gavin O'Connor who also wrote the story and starred but the direction could have been a bit tighter and its not a movie where every scene is trimmed with a few wasted shots or lazy and obvious camera work. Although performances were all good some of the characters seemed to lack depth and I felt the wife (Jennifer Morrison) was a little underused as I thought Nick's role also seemed to be forgotten about in the final third. These are very minor quibbles but unfortunately the main one is that it's a product of its self - it's difficult for any film like this to avoid the cliché or cheesy ending. A film focusing on two main fighters in the same competition was always limited on outcomes and although Warrior does it's best I'm afraid the ending could have been handled a bit better.Very enjoyable movie that I hope gets the audience it deserves. Give it a try even if it's not your usual cuppa tea.8 out of 10"
"As a teenager, I'm definitely inexperienced in the world of MMA. But this movie is not about MMA, and that is set very clear from the start. Right from the start of the 2 minute trailer. So naturally I was ecstatic to take my seat in the theater.Tom Hardy (Tommy Conlon) delivers a moving and emotional performance of a man who has suffered greatly from the ones he loves, and from the field of battle, an all to real reality for people of today. While the younger Tommy suffered the loss of his mother firsthand, his older brother Brendan (Joel Edgerton)has put together a life that a man dreams of, yet is still haunted daily by his past. Only to have it threatened to be destroyed by the bank. Nick Nolte the alcoholic father of the two, has suffered years of remorse and regret from the abuse of alcohol and the neglect of his wife and children is trying to forge a bond but is meeting a stone wall with both of his sons.The fighting, though it is very well acted and shot, is not about fighting. It is the physical representation of the struggle between the three men, the struggle to forget and forgive and to move on. The demons that possess all three of these men are of such great proportion, the only way they can be relinquished is for them to come together.It hits home on such a high level on so many different subjects, that you will be floored into your seat as the credits roll in.An ABSOLUTE MUST SEE :)"
"A very cliché sports story, with so many corny moments that you'll have seen in six dozen other films that it becomes ludicrous long before its end. Yet, in some ways, it's pretty well done, and it nearly overcomes those clichés. Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy play two brothers who parted ways way back when they were teenagers. Hardy went away with his mother and later joined the Marines after she passed away. Now he has returned to his father (Nick Nolte), a former drunk who drove his family apart. Edgerton didn't like his father much, either, but chose not to go with his brother and mother because he was in love with the woman he would eventually marry (Jennifer Morrison). Both brothers are skilled fighters and have their eyes set on the big prize in a mixed martial arts tournament. The film somewhat succeeds because it's very low-key. Most of the time, it's hard to notice how melodramatic and predictable the story is. The performances help, too (Joel Edgerton was my favorite of the three big characters). After a while, though, we get stuff like a wife who refuses to watch the fight impatiently pacing behind her cell phone, on a table in the foreground, waiting for a call to tell her her husband has won a match. And Hardy's story is beyond ridiculous - he gets invited to the tournament after beating up a trained MMA champion in a local gym - never mind that Hardy, at best, was just a trained wrestler many years ago in high school. Being in the Marines does not give you superpowers. That's just the start of the ridiculousness that ends up, obviously, with the two brothers fighting in the ring (with Edgerton's wife, at this point, of course watching from ringside). I should probably call Gavin O'Connor one of the best directors of the year, because, as over-the-top as all this stuff is (and, believe me, I barely scratched the surface - the movie runs for 2 hours and 20 minutes), it generally doesn't feel that way. If one doesn't look too closely at it, I could imagine it seeming great. But it's not."
"Minutes after watching this piece of art. And I feel like over- powered godlike human being. What an inspiring movie! Oh, the pace! This tone makes us fall into the world of the 2 bros, who's life seems so much full of pain, loss, confusion and, above all, a kind of love that they couldn't express. The character of the Father is tragic and realistic. His attempts to rejoin his boys are truly pure and gets to the heart.Acting is quite memorable, specially Hardy's. I've found his exceptional and natural. The magic of the combination of characters, story, pace and music ends up with a creation of rare feelings shouting into your spiritual world and that's not something that every movie is able to manage.Thank you for making this true, thank you for that awesome experience!"
"I just watched this movie for the fifth time in 8 years. What is clear to me is, that this is not about fighting or winning. This is a movie about love. Love between brothers and forgiveness to their alcoholic father who failed them over and over again. What is so impressive to me is that none of the three guys in the movie (Hardy, Edgerton, Nolte) seems to know a way to show their deep love to any of the others. They are wearing this ""fighter person suit"" (Hardy especially. brilliant) but are also able to show us the vulnerable child that was left behind. I thought it is only me but when I showed this gem of a film to my niece, who is a big movie fan and was only 18 years old at the time (I should mention she has also two brothers), I could observe my own first reaction to it multiplied by ten: she was crying so hard in the end (and also in between) that we needed to comfort her. After calming down she told us that this was one of the most beautiful movies she has ever seen (and who am I to contradict her)."
"It is not that Warrior is not a good film;in fact, from a point on it grabs you in continuous commitment with your heart pumping fast and helplessly.The truth is that at the start it looks like it wants to be something more than another fighting movie, with the roles of Nolte and Hardy, and the reading of Mobby Dick, some kind of elegy.And it could succeed at it, as the Hardy character-in one of Hardy's best performances-is built masterfully;yet, the other characters of the film gradually become banal, and whats worst-please do not read further if you have not seen the movie-at the end there is the most conservative choice one could imagine, as the winner is the family man who fights in order to pay for the home of his family, whereas the heroic-and anti heroic-veteran, looses everything.One could argue that the end is about reconciliation and the return to the unity of the family;in my opinion, it is a total fiasco that let me down and made me really angry. There should be some other way to discourage violence without letting down the most interesting character of the movie.His defeat is the failure of the film to be anything more than a family fighting movie to watch at home.Yet, for Hardy alone, I would very much like to watch it again."
"I get that companies have to show some cool stuff to attract the audience. But the trailer gives some key plot elements (as does the ""PLOT"" section on IMDb), as well as some MAJOR SPOILERS. For the first time, we have a movie, where there are 2 protagonists and 2 antagonists, which means the final fight, and the winner is not determined, and could be anyone. The only problem is, they show A LOT on the trailer, that you pretty much know how the end will be. Just watch it without the trailer, IMO finally we have a more evolved version of Rocky here."
"Okay so I'm also one of those people who ""only registered to comment on this movie"" and I see a lot of people here being either ""OMG! BEST. MOVIE. EVER."" or ""omg how can this even be classified as a movie.Well in my opinion this movie is worth a watch, far from the best or even one of the greater movies I've seen but it was watchable till' the end, it didn't at least feel like a 2 hour movie. What follows are my problems with the film and I think you should see the movie before continuing reading. I'm going to talk about the drama, not how this is a rocky ripoff, fight-scenes, the incredible improbability that these two guys would end up in a tournament like this etc.SPOILER LINE OF DOOM - DO NOT PROCEED Okay so I gave this film a 6 out of 10 and I don't feel it deserves anything more, and nothing less. I'm really baffled to see how so many people see this as fantastic or great drama, the only dram that i felt had any impact on me was the relationship Tommy had with his father because they actually shared scenes with each other and you really could feel Tommys' anger with his father... unlike the relationship with his brother... which is the climax of the movie.To me it feels like they just throw a lot of negative events into everyones lives and expect me to instantly feel for them and apparently it works on some people but personally i need more than bad news to care for a person. Brendan has money issues, and he's angry with his father for being a drunk and spending more time with his brother than him, Brendan has one scene where he actually talks to his father. One. You can't expect me to feel anything about this come on.Tommy. His friend dies, goes AWOL, angry with his brother for leaving, angry with his father for being a drunk and he's an ex-marine. Whoa they really just threw everything and anything into this guy to make him likable. He has one scene with his brother where he says that he's mad because Brendan left. That's it. And this is gonna be sufficient for the finale? It ain't. What, all he ever wanted was for his brother to say he loves him and that would make it all okay? I really just didn't get why they ended this film like they did, I've seen some reviews here from people claiming they cried, personally I was in an emotional what the.. statement. Oh yeah, Tommy is fighting because he made a promise to his dead friends wife that he'd take care of them, we know this from 1 scene where he made a phone call and never speak of this again. I mean... what the hell is with this movie throwing so much in it and not developing anything.The thing I think the movie got right was the relationship Tommy had with his father Paddy. Nick Nolte does a great performance and I really sympathize with him and it was emotional seeing Tommy finally forgiving him, kind of, maybe he just felt guilty I really don't know they just kind of jumped to the climax from there. Anyway it was nice seeing some closure between them.Okay first review and it got pretty long, at least I feel I got what I wanted out and think they should have left some parts out and developed other more and for that, it's worth a 5-6. Not the best I've seen, nor the worst, just something watchable in the middle. If this will be the best drama you have seen, like some people on this site claim it is, guess what? There's so many other movies for you to watch than this one, better ones."
"First and foremost let me say this: this is not an MMA movie. This isn't really even a sports movie, per se. It is really a drama about a family and the relationships inside that family and the sport of mma just happens to be the backdrop that carries the story forward. I know a lot of people that didn't watch it because they don't like mma or even sports movies and I tell them exactly what I wrote above. I rated this a 10; and I only give movies a rating of 10 if they manage to move me emotionally - they have to move beyond just mere entertainment. This movie will make you cry and it will force you to reevaluate your own relationships with those around you. This is an an amazing movie, and amazing drama and it's disappointing how many people haven't and won't ever see it simply because they think it's a ""mma movie.""Seriously, watch this movie."
"First off - great camera-work, hence the 2. Now for the core of the movie - brother vs brother is a fun plot that can be twisted every which way. However as soon as some obviously fake Russian character is introduced with the completely out of place Visotski song playing in the background... the pieces start falling in place. This is a classical American tearjerker feelgood movie. The idea alone of a classic underdog has been made into film 100 times better in Rocky, where not the selfish victory but ""all-in"" attempt at it is what really counts. A battle that could not be won, yet one does not give up. This is the opposite. What could have been a very dramatic (and believable! and almost heartbreaking!) plot of two brothers pitted against each other is washed down the tubes. For someone who has a moderate interest in MMA it is clear the the ending was completely unrealistic and would have never taken place. This is not 1900's, today people are not beaten to within an inch of their life in the ring. To contrast this to any VanDamme flick - think of this movie being a much better attempt at a fighter movie, minus actual fighters who have no acting skills, but add to it American superiority complex and you have the ""warrior"". Overrated, and sad to say this ""warrior"" won in the ring but lost to idealism."
"OK, actually this is a decent sports drama, and I would rate it 6.5-7 if it wasn't for an utterly horrifying plot element that seems to have escaped most people: The main hero of the story is forced into foreclosure of his home by an arrogant banker who weaseled him into his loan in the first place, and now refuses to extend it. His only way out is to participate in a no-holds-barred fight tournament organized and financed by - an arrogant Wall Street banker! Just how sick is that? The people who force ordinary Americans into bankruptcy get the additional kick of watching said Americans get their heads bashed in - and be grateful for the wads of cash they may receive if they make it. Exactly like 'Hunger Games', only there it's criticized and in a SciFi setting, whereas 'Warrior' glorifies this state of things and is set in the present day! Almost as if the US today were some sort of Ancient Rome, where the impoverished should be thankful for their chance to prove their merit in the arena like the gladiators of yore.Other reasons for me to dislike the film were various plot gaps wider than the Grand Canyon: if a soldier goes AWOL in Iraq - how can he resurface in the US under a different name? Are we supposed to believe that US immigration turns a blind eye on disgruntled young men? Besides the fact that the feat, for which he is so celebrated in the film, is physically impossible (body submerged in water = no leverage).Then there's the 'Rocky' thing: below-than-average fighter trains for a big tournament and makes it against all odds. In 'Rocky', however, the whole story is about getting there, how to overcome the shortcomings of the body by willpower, and the final fight is a draw, not a victory - because in that film, the emphasis is on keeping it real, and that's what makes it a classic. 'Warrior', however, features totally unbalanced fight sequences; the only difference to wrestling would be the missing name calling, and that it presents itself as a real deal, where in fact anybody who's ever done a bit of martial arts can only shake his head and go WTF.On the plus side, there's Nick Nolte's great presence in a, however, highly cliché role. But aforementioned plot element, which I perceive as an assault on common sense and civil rights, prompts me to condemn this film completely. If there's anyone in this film who'd deserve a good thrashing, it's the organizer of the Sparta tournament!"
"My first glance, I thought it's gonna be like The Fighter since this film is about fighting sports and there's a brother relationship. But here, the brothers are against to each other. The film doesn't really spend so much time dealing with their relationship. It mostly goes to the father of the main leads. The film is unnecessarily long but the third act has plenty of exciting MMA fights. If you're expecting this to be like The Fighter then you'll be disappointed. But Warrior has its own drama piece.What's intriguing about this film is the idea of making these brothers fight on a match. Most of the film is an exposition to their lives. Telling what happened to them from the past and bringing a lot of emotions. There are only few scenes of Tommy and Brendan being together but all we know they're against to each other. It's a family struggle.When it comes to the third act, it's all about the fighting. The fighting is pretty exciting. It's also too suspenseful because the first 90 minutes of the film is getting to know these characters. Fans of MMA and UFC will enjoy the whole third act. No matter what, Tom Hardy is always awesome. The film has plenty of heart and emotions. Most of these goes to Nick Nolte. He made all of his scenes compelling. I think Joel Edgerton is bland but his fighting is pretty good.I'm a bit disappointed after watching this because I thought it's gonna be like The Fighter but still this is pretty good. More darker but not quite better though. The action is better. If there is one thing that is similar to The Fighter then that probably be the filmmaking. The camera's shaky, a little music score, but a whole lot of style. Well, this is not True Story but the drama works mostly to the scenes of Nick Nolte. Since he nails most of the drama, Hardy and Edgerton nails the action. Warrior has a lot of emotions and a bit of bromance."
"This is my first review on IMDb,in fact I specially sighed up here to give a comment and vote cos until now I trusted the score system on the movies here...8.3 and 55K votes for this movie!?!Maybe its only me but this film doesn't deserve that score, I've seen lots of movies but this is far from a 8,3....I mean please it has all the clichés of the American bull- crap(I am not saying that everything American is bull crap)but this film has most of them,very cleverly hidden behind a story that keeps you hoping it wouldn't be the same bull crap American cliché.Maybe this is a good indicator how retarded the world is becoming.If there wasn't so much hype around this film I would've give in it a higher score ,but sadly my first vote on IMDb which I respect,had to be 1(awful)star."
"this movie absolutely sucks! the whole plot, the clichés! I just do not understand how this movie got such a high rating! The movie has such a dumb storyline! I am wondering if people are giving it a high rating because of the popularity of MMA? The whole movie is just so full of unrealistic possibilities. From the AWAL Marine who becomes a hero on his way out from IRAQ,who all of a sudden becomes an MMA killer? to the moonlighting Teacher who beats down an undefeated MMA fighter? or How about the two brothers fighting each other for the finale? what are the odds of that happening? I am usually not such a hard critic but the unrealistic high rating made me post this. Please people please rate this movie correctly and not just on MMA Scenes. I would never watch this movie again! I think people should re rate this movie once they clearly see how boring and unrealistic this movie is!"
"This amazing family drama movie from 2011 made megastars out of then-unknown actors, Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy. Both really put great performances in and out of the ring. Both really took a beaten, to make the cage fighting seem real. Edgerton suffer from a torn MCL, while Tom Hardy suffered a broken toe, broken ribs, and a broken finger. It takes a lot of guts just to do that. Not only does Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy, make very brutality and believable gritty fights, but I love how both were able to touch the heart-strings as well. The intensity from both of them, made this movie, very entertaining. Directed by Gavin O'Connor, the movie tells the stories of two estranged brothers, Troubled Iraq vet, Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) & unemployed and indebt teacher, Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) who enter a Mixed Martial Arts tournament to compete with each other, for their own good moral reasons. Who is going to win? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I love the fact, that the movie doesn't make, a bad seed out of Tommy or Brendan. Both characters have their faults, and their good side. However, I do believe that their one-dimensional fighting styles, don't really match up with their personality. Don't get me wrong, it's cool to see, Tom Hardy all buff out and knocking people out, with his striking ability, but it makes little to no sense in the context of the character's history. After all, wasn't this man once a former wrestling prodigy? Wouldn't he be, doing more takes down, and arm holds than his brother, Brendan!? I don't get it! Another problem with the film is the huge gaps in logic within the story structure. A good example is how Tommy even got back to the US, if he supposedly went AWOL in Iraq. You would think, that wouldn't be easy. Another problem with the film is how the film, has no epilogue, so we never see the repercussions of Tommy's desertion nor find out what becomes of the family he promised to support. What happen to them!? Brendan's story arch isn't any better. Brendan being forced into fighting by economic reasons, to supplement his income is bit of a joke. It doesn't make any sense, since most amateur fighters make little to no money at all. Most of them, pursuit this dangerous career, because it's their dream job. Brendan had no reason to go back into fighting; after all, he was a physic teacher! Colleges would pay, good money for his teaching ability. Brendan's main flaw is his pride. His absolute refusal to file for bankruptcy or move to a smaller house, even though his wife, Tess (Jennifer Morrison) would rather take that option than watch him risk his life in the ring is be too selfish than inspiring to watch. I know, that Brendan Conlon was based off, real-life math teacher turn UFC fighter, Rich Franklin, but unlike Brendan in the film, Franklin went from teaching math to fighting, because his love for the sport, not economic reason. In my opinion, it would make more sense that Brendan went back into fighting, because that's what he wanted to do; not because he had to. Another thing that seem a bit illogically in the film is how both men whom seem, a bit amateurism in their fighting records, were able to get into the Sparta winner-takes-all competition at all. You would think, that a high-profile, winner-takes-all competition with a $5 million purse would be fill with more season trained fighters than amateur fighters. The mixer of amateurs with mostly unsanctioned fighting records with pro-fighters seem a bit too jarring to be taken seriously. It's like if Daniel LaRusso from 1984's Karate Kid was against Martial Arts Master, Bruce Lee. It's kinda unbelievable to see that ever happening in real life. Although the competition action sequences takes itself pretty realistically; there were too many terrible calls from the ref and judges to make any the fights in this film, seem 100% realistic in real fighting accuracy. I give the movie, more like 75% in that. Still, the idea that a MMA sport event is a brutal blood sport where competitors are able to continue to fight with a broken arm is also a highly doubtful probability. I know that it was played up for dramatic effect, but in reality, getting your arm broken would result in an immediate stoppage, no matter how much you want to continue fighting. While, I have to say, the performances in the ring were really great, despite some flaws, I have to say, that the performances out of the ring, were a little better. Most of the best parts in the film, are the interactions between the family members. The movie deals with some weighty mature content that most people might find, a little too uneasily, to watch. The conflicted relationship between fathers and sons, the estrangement of brothers, PTSD, alcoholism, inferiority, abandonment issues and family debts are all melodrama clichés used at its best. Nick Nolte as the boys' father, Paddy, a retired, recovering alcoholic boxer is outstanding. I was really glad, he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, for this role, that year. His recovery and his will to redeem himself, made for a very inspiring side story. Another great part of this film is the soundtrack by Mark Isham. The track 'Listening to the Beethoven', is amazing. Not only that, but the music that came along with it, such as the band, the Natural's song 'About Today"" was gripping to hear. Overall: This underdog emotional fighting story was a major hit for me. Tons of manly tears from me. A great inspiring punch, to knock some sense in you, if you're feeling out of the fight. A must-watch."
"SPOILER: This movie is something new. Everything was so unpredictable, fights, tournament and what an end, totally unexpected, two brothers in the final. What a story!!! Really, I think this film is in top 10, no top 5, worst sport-drama movies in last decade. Do not waste your time. Do not waste your time and money on this film. It is absolute mystery how Warrior reached 8.3 on IMDb. It should be in best case 5, so that people know that they cannot expect any intellectual challenge. So, I guess this is a movie for Ultimate fight fans, because that is the only that it can offer, fight scenes (pumped and not realistic). And believe, this has nothing with a fact that I am a female. I watched Warrior with my brother and husband, both of them shared my opinion. Nothing new, full of stereotypes. OK, I will admit one bright spot. Hotel scene with drunk Nick Nolte character and Tom Hardy character is 3 bright minutes in 140 min of nothing."
"See, back in the day about 10 years ago, when the Good the bad and the ugly was rated 7.7 and Barry Lyndon was rated 7.5, people were more sensible. This movie is ONE BIG Cliché, OH MY GOD, other than Nick Nolte's performance, everything else was violently cliché. See, back in the day, there's no way in hell this movie would be at 8.3, probably low 5's. See, here is how the director got such a high score from the sheeple. First you got to have a touching subject that ends not in tragedy but happiness: father son mad at each other then make up, let's see that covers about a quarter of the viewing audience. Next brothers make up, another quarter at least, next economic struggle, mortgage foreclosure, another quarter at least, next drug addiction, trying to cope, serve in the military, oooooo, National Pride!!! more boost to the score, more BOOST!!! More sheeple voting 8 or higher.My eagle eye sees everything, few can escape the sharpness of my intellect."
"This is a formula movie which makes no sense at all and merely sets up conditions that will supposedly tug at your heart strings. It's difficult to give the reasons for my conclusion without putting in a spoiler. The plot is thin, the characters unbelievable and the ending is absolutely ridiculous.True, we enjoy movies as a way to escape reality for a little while but how so much money can be spent making a movie as bad as this is beyond any logical thought. I suppose if you are a teenager and like flash bang violence without any thought to reality then this would be the movie to see. Afterwards you can go beat up some grade school children and buy a trophy for your efforts."
"Over the years, the sport of boxing has provided film-goers with undeniably great films like ""Rocky"", ""The Champ"", ""Million Dollar Baby"", and ""The Fighter"". In today's culture, though, boxing has been replaced by mixed martial arts as the fight game of choice. This is a movie that speaks to that culture.For a basic plot summary, ""Warrior"" tells the story of two brothers. Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) is a high school physics teacher moonlight as a UFC fighter in parking lots at night for the money. Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) is a former Marine and former high school wrestling champion. Their only two common interests? Hatred of their father Paddy (Nick Nolte), and the opportunity to win the biggest even in their sport of choice.Simply put, ""Warrior"" is ever bit as good as ""The Fighter"" (in fact, both films share many of the same superb characteristics). This movie is a human drama first, with MMA fighting being the backdrop for the dramatic material. It is a visceral story that is not simple in any sense of the word. It is very dramatic, to be sure, yet it still maintains a very healthy grip on character relationships and thus stays as true to reality as possible. There are shades of grey in everything, with nothing being cut-and-dry.For hardcore MMA fans, ""Warrior"" also offers some great fight scenes and action. When you are watching the fights, it seems as if you are truly watching a live UFC event.Thus, ""Warrior"" is a top-notch drama that compares very favorably to the best fight films ever produced. It will truly make you care about the characters and be rooting for them (or even against them) in a variety of complex ways. It's ""The Fighter""...only with triangle chokes and arm- bars."
"I haven't written any review till now (and probably I won't do it from now on) but this movie intrigued me enough to make me write this. First of all, a definition: cliché: a trite, stereotyped expression; a sentence or phrase, usually expressing a popular or common thought or idea, that has lost originality, ingenuity, and impact by long overuse. Second, my claim: this movie is a festival of clichés. I will argue in support of this claim:1) the broken family cliché: common man! I saw this one over and over again!2) the beautiful family cliché: nice smart husband (he's a teacher), good looking wife, two cute kids3) the evil system cliché: a) banks are bad guys, b) the scene where Tommy and his friend signaled their presence but the American army did nothing to save them - soldiers are good, armies are bad, c) Brendan is suspended till the end of the semester. 4) the good cause cliché: fighters are not just violent and vain ... they need to fight for something bigger than them. Brendan for his family, Tommy for his friend's widow. this is so much as those TV shows where lots of social cases are presented to the public and they sing, dance or whatever ... and they all represent a good cause and everybody cries and so on. 5) the bad guy cliché: this was actually the trigger for my review. After more than 20 years since the ending of the Cold War, the director thought that the bad guy must be a Russian (with no Russian traits whatsoever). This is not all! :)) Koba has a red communist T-short! common man! this is hilarious! and the Russian patriotic song!? :)) (lukilly it wasn't Katiusha) the second bad guy is the gym guy. (he beats a spare partner)6) the spiritual training cliché: this is a variation of the fast-food yoga cliché (many martial arts movies present this cliché) yeah Beethoven is nice but really ... conlons are fighters not dalai lamas!7) the lucky coincidence cliché: Marco Santos broke his leg and Brendan is there to replace him. I saw this move so many times ...8) the slow hard working turtle cliché: your lack of skills is not important! you only need to work hard and have a moral purpose. You will beat anybody! :)) this is related here with the underdog cliché and to the age in sport is like age in wines-the older, the better. I mean if Stalone/Rocky did it and they were like 60 years old ... Brendan could do it too!9) the gangsta education cliché: this has two parts: first, American high-school students are usually pictured (in American movies) like not that smart (but cool) punks. Second, the teacher is also cool but smart enough to teach a gangsta version of physics (Newton in this case). I don't know much about US education system .. but physics implies math and in senior classes you can't teach stuff that easy! anyway this is a cliché because I saw it in lots of American movies.10) the resenting wife cliché: this is about every wife in any boxing/martial arts movie .. first she is frightened then she become a supporter ...11) the danger of death cliché: these movies grossly exaggerate the danger of practicing a sport. I mean OK is not chess, they usually get hurt but really, it is a sport, there are rules and actually driving is statistically more dangerous than practicing MMA.12) the brothers cliché: way too many brothers in boxing/martial arts movies. you can't be a boxer if you are the only child!:)) the final scene is ... (I won't describe it here) sooooo much like Latin American soap operas. I MEAN .. REALLY! so from these 12 points ... yes, I think that the movie is a festival of clichés and that's not a coincidence. (can't prove this but I have a feeling). If you want to sell something ... there are at least two ways: you can sale the future in the present (mainly Apple's strategy) or you can sell emotional clichés. This movie (I think) is on the second class. It sells emotions that ordinary people usually experience. everything is simple and focused on the viewer's emotion not on his/her reason. we are all brothers, sons, we all have wifes, kids, we all have problems with the system ... the only difference is that in movies we can actually win:)) and that's why we buy this movie. We win here. in itself, the movie is not as pathetic as I described it (Nolte actually did a decent job and the Moby Dick stuff might be a nice idea). The pathetic part is the huge amount of stars it received. the only thing that's missing from this picture is an Oscar for Tom Hardy or for his more pathetic brother-character, Brendan/Joel!"
"I don't understand how this movie got 8.3 rating which is more than Scarface and the Sixth Sense got. It is just an average scenario with a horrible ending, too long and boring dialogs. There were 10 of us who watched this movie, 8 of us didn't get the movie. The three characters have problems with each other but no one knows what their problems are, and movie ends like that. Nothing interesting in this movie. I trusted around 45 thousand users' rating and rented this movie but I regretted. If you are a movie lover, just stay away this movie and don't waste your time. It's not worth more than 5.5 rating. It is just an ordinary movie."
"Oh boy! We've got yet another Rocky movie, this time written by an over-the-top hardship pornographer. All this film needs is a girlfriend recovering from heroin addiction, and the pathos of that, and her illegitimate child who needs an operation no one can afford.... The hero will go in the proving ground and battle for the blah blah blah.The women ogle pectoral definition and the men clench their fists and swing their shoulders. Really, this film just rehashes all those old 1970s buttons and levers to try to make us root for the fighter and his noble cause. There's nothing new here and in a year or so it will have slipped from the top 250 to a more reasonable middle-of-the-pack seat on the list.Most sports movies have a set pattern to some extent and almost invariably involve an underdog, a villain, and a subplot of some family issue. We expect it and it's the variations on these themes that make or break a movie. This is all cliché stapled to a newish sport."
"How this film got 8/10 stars is beyond me. They meet on the beach at night for a tête-à-tête? Puhleez. The music is overblown and sappy. The fight scenes are absurd. Nolte reads from a script that is nothing but a chain of clichés.8/10? #145 in the top 250? I guess the knuckle draggers who enjoyed the film know enough to rate a movie online, but not enough to distinguish between this dreck and something that actually required artistry and intelligence (""There Will Be Blood,"" or ""The 400 Blows,"" or ""Barry Lyndon,"" for example, which are given lower ratings).No wonder ""Idiocracy"" was buried...it was too close to the bone for the audiences who screened it."
"If you like a movie filled with clichés you will love this one. Me and my friends watched this and it's easy to predict what's gonna happen. Oh, and don't forget, one of the actors plays an ex marine! Cool? Nope..I bet that it's only Americans who will enjoy this movie. It's a laughable one, and as my friend said ""they should rename this movie to the cliché"" and I couldn't agree more.Yout might enjoy this a little bit if you like Nick Nolte, because he's the only one who's doing a decent performance in this movie.I don't understand how some people can say ""best fighting movie ever"", ""oh it's so emotional"". Well, if that's your opinion you haven't watched a lot of movies in you'r life (or maybe you're an ex marine?).You will enjoy a couple fights, but get ready to be disappointed."
"Please don't read this if you don't want the ending given away.I've noticed a lot of people complaining that the ending spoils the film and is clichéd because the underdog and not the better fighter wins.I'm not suggesting that my interpretation is the right one but my view is somewhat different than the one some people hold. It is perfectly logical to point out that Brendan had hard fights to get to the final and that he would probably have been exhausted and that Tommy has had a much easier route.However, the point is that he made that route easier because of his rage. Tommy is only the more destructive force because of that. His demons are driving him on because he is lost. He cannot or will not reach out to connect with his father or brother. The point is that the dam is broken when he sees his father in the hotel room raging against Ahab. This is deeply symbolic. I think you are meant to draw the connection with Ahab who was driven by his own rage with the rage of the father which destroyed his family to the rage which Tommy now feels. Even though he is drunk it is no coincidence that his father refers to Tommy as Ahab and bellows at him to stop the ship. At the point that Tommy takes him in his arms and holds him he begins the healing process but loses what makes him such a formidable fighter. Thus he is simply unable to blow his brother away in the way that he has done to every other opponent.The other crucial point (and you would have to be a younger brother to fully get this one) is that Tommy doesn't really want to beat his brother at that point. He needs to know that his brother loves him and perhaps that he regrets not reaching out to him when they were younger. The fact that he taps out only at the point when Brendan says he loves him is significant as is the fact that he breaks down in the corner before the final round. Had he still been carrying his rage he would surely rather have been rendered unconscious than submit.In other words, for me it was the perfect ending and the more you think about the film the more profound it seems.All in my view of course. Which could be a load of old rubbish."
This is a rare fight movie in which we don't want to see either fighter lose. That brings such complexity to the final.
"This movie is not in my usual genre. I'm not big on watching drama movies, having had enough of it in my own life.
I had never see. Joel Edgerton or Tom Hardy in anything before.
As I i into got to the movie, I could certainly begin to relate with many situations and characters.I was drawn onto this movie with powerful intensity. I was riveted by everything. Nick Nolte as the repented alcoholic father touched me. My father was an alcoholic who never repented or tried in any way, so I sympathized with his character, while also sympathizing with the brothers pain and anguish over what his drinking did to their family.I was deeply moved by the rift in the brothers relationship. Another relatable situation. I felt myself pulled deeper and deeper to the characters, expertly acted by all three actors. They did so well I literally get every bit of anger and pain.The end fight was the most powerful, emotional scene in a movie. It ranks very high for me for the top spot. The music chosen was superb to capture the essence of the brothers relationship and catharsis. It was violent, and harsh and rough, but there was a beauty to it and a real, honest human element that many of us can relate to.Again, not normally my kind of movie, this has become one of my favorites and is on the top shelf of my movie case.Beautifully acted, beautifully shot, beautifully directed. It did not receive the recognition it deserved"
"Mixed Martial Arts isn't a sport we see much of in the movies. Some people might say it isn't a sport at all and in ""Warrior"" one character describes it as a cockfight, referring to the fighters as animals. In this movie it's certainly brutal but then movies that feature any form of boxing usually are. Gavin O'Connor's film is about a couple of estranged brothers competing against each other in a Mixed Martial Arts tournament and is a wholly admirable picture.You can guess from the title and the subject matter that this is a man's movie, or at least a male-orientated one, which means it manages to hide the inevitable sentimentality behind a veil of blood, sweat and tears. It's very well written by O'Connor, Anthony Tambakis and Cliff Dorfman and brilliantly acted by Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy as the brothers and an Oscar-nominated Nick Nolte as their equally estranged father while there's also great work from Kevin Dunn as a high-school principal, Frank Grillo as Edgerton's coach and Jennifer Morrison as his wife. It's also superbly photographed and edited and how if failed to get a Best Picture nomination is something of a mystery."
"****spooooooooooooooooooooooilers!!!!!!!!!!!!*********this movie is the biggest insult in the history of film making. at first they start the moving showing Tommy as the obvious protagonist. in the first 10 minutes you fill in all of the blanks of his history and immediately understand where he's coming from, having to bury his mother and leave his selfish brother. he spends every waking moment, training and fighting his way to be the best of the best to win the tournament and fulfill the promise he made to his comrades wife. Brendan walks in with his perfect life, beautiful wife, beautiful kids, stable job that he clearly loves aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand then the film even has the audacity to have him give a birthday present to his daughter that is clearly out of their families means. granted one of his daughter did have heart problems and the medical bills were piling up, he and his wife couldn't face the facts and just live within their means. instead after Tommy instantly dominates every single opponent he has ever faced in this movie, he falls short to the man who got his ass kicked outside of a strip club... so at the very end of the movie when the entire crowd is cheering Tommy's name right before he gets his ass kicked, i'm just supposed to lay back and be satisfied with him and his brother hugging it out?????????????? and not to mention right before he gets taken away for fleeing the military because he has no other option. i can't believe this filth passes as a film with the quality to make it into the IMDb top 250. what this world views as deserving and just literally makes me sick."
"The initial reviews floored me of this being a great movie.I'm not understanding the comparisons to Rocky, any of the Rocky movies.Story? You don't know what's going on for a main story line until the very end of the movie. Even then, it's extremely thin.You have one absolutely unstoppable brother, former Marine who destroys everyone he faces in the cage including a one punch knockout to one opponent. To face his brother, a slightly beefed up Conan O'Brien who's a teacher. I see mentions of Nick Nolte and an Oscar nomination, he's not in the movie enough, he has 2 major scenes, really.Also mentions that MMA fans will enjoy this, not true. The only lengthy fight scene had been at the end when the brothers fight, 3 rounds out of 5. Do yourself a favor, stay far away from this movie. Catch it on cable and then decide for yourself. This ranks as one of the worst movies I've ever seen and that is saying a lot!"
"Comparing this movie to Rocky is an outrage, so shame on you if you dare compare a poop pile like this to Rocky. Warrior has some decent fighting scenes in it but thats where it ends which unfortunately isn't enough to make an entertaining movie. The acting was below average and the way the entire story was put together was a train wreck. This one just drags on and on and on and it's so unbelievably boring that you would have to be a warrior to stay awake. I think spending 2 hours watching grass grow would have a better plot. The fact that the story in a way tries to rip off Rocky makes it pretty pathetic as well but I would still never dare compare this to Rocky. I gave the movie a 3 because like I said the fighting scenes were OK."
"If you are looking for a fight you'll get it. You'll also get a lot more. This was the first movie I have EVER shed a tear in. Gripping and powerful. Even though the trailer made it clear how each fight was going to end I was still on the edge of my seat.The family dynamic was heart wrenching. Nick Nolte's performance as a lonely old man grasping for a hint of forgiveness from his family is Oscar-worthy. The roles of the two brothers were pretty archetypal (tough guy fights for honor, peaceful guy puts gloves back on to fight for family) but were played well, and the family relations make up for the lack of originality."
Really??what kind of scenario is this.... are we at the 90s when the good and weak must always win??? or must always the ruined family to be loved again...??? It is impossible for an amateur and an old fighter to win this competition. I was expecting a much realistic scenario in which the characters should be responsible for they decisions. It is another thing to give us a happy ending and another to give us a fairy tale. Too bad....rocky was much a better movie and also they stole the Cinderella man inspiration...they don't even make us to feel the emotions they wanted us to feel.. Bad movie...too bad for hardy cause he is the next big thing!!!!
"Men also need romantic pop corn flicks like The Notebook or Twilight. That has been proved with Warrior. I've read and heard that a lot of guys have been saying how Warrior made them cry, how emotional it was. I get it.But this movie doesn't deserve 8/10 and i think it has 8/10 because most guys rated before wiping their eyes.Warrior brings out the big guns. Every cliché you've seen is used here. Almost every line is cheesy. Did you enjoy seeing how the teacher beats up the undefeated Russian world champion, knowing it could never happen in real life? If you did, you got clicheed good.Did you like the ever so cheesy scenes with the kids routing in the parking lot & the principal routing in his living room? Cheesy.Nolte was brilliant, but this movie isn't and the ratings will probably drop once people re watch it with dry eyes.5/10, for Noltes performance, and because i enjoy fantasy. After all, it's a movie about the biggest tournament in the world where the best fighters from all over the planet fight, and the 2 finalists is a teacher who has been working out for 1 month and one ex soldier who hasn't fought since he was 10. (And the TEACHER WINS, LOL!)"
"***spoilers warning***This movie is the worst sport movie I have ever seen !!! where do I start !!! poor tomy! Wasn't enough that he had to leave home alone with his mother to escape his father, then had to watch his mother die and berry her!! He saw all his friends die in IRAQ and when he came back he risked his life (knowing that the army will know his place) just to win some money and give it to the poor widow !! he even went to his father who he hates just to get the money. On the other hand, his brother brandin screwed him and their mother at the last moment because he fell in love !!! he got the perfect life, wife, job and children!! He only needs the money so he doesn't leave his big home to a smaller one !!! Seriously !!!! brandin takes 5 millions at the end !!! and poor tomy and the widow got nothing !! it wasn't enough what he suffered for his whole life !! but also the army was waiting for him to take him under custody at the end of the movie !!! I really didn't get the point of it! Except that I think they wanted to say "" don't underestimate the underdog"" but they exaggerated a lot and delivered the message poorly!!the last fight was so cliché, tomy was superman knocking out every one with one hit and Brandin struggles in every game. at the end, guess who won?"
"The movie Warrior, truly is a great movie. I enjoyed everything about it. It was inspiring, uplifting, real, and just flat out good. Everything a movie should be.You don't have to be an MMA or fighting fan to enjoy this film. But I'm sure you'll like it by the end. It pulls you in from the start, and you can't help but care about these characters. Played by Nick Nolte, Tom Hardy, and Joel Edgerton.Nolte is the father of Hardy and Edgerton, and both sons are MMA fighters trying to win a tournament for their own different reasons.Throughout the movie you're rooting for both these men, and hoping for the best. I have a brother and we saw this movie together. By the end, we didn't know whether to be happy or cry. And that's good.I was not disappointed with this film in anyway, and by the end of it, it almost brought a tear to my eye. I love this movie, and recommend anyone and everyone to go and see it."
"If you like predictable boxing movies with caricatures of boxing caricatures named Tommy (always with fingerless gloves on and a black, cotton stocking hat) and some over acting, you may like Warrior. You may not.Paddy Conlon (Nolte) is a recovering alcoholic and dead beat dad of Tommy (Hardy) and Brendan (Edgerton). Apparently, he trained both sons to be mixed martial arts fighters. Mixed martial arts is really boxing, wrestling, kick boxing, karate and just dirty street fighting all combined into one. It is sort of legalized cock fighting for human males. Somewhere along the line, their mother got sick and died and Tommy joined the Marines. Brendan apparently knocked up his girlfriend and ran off and started a new life. No love was lost anywhere. Tommy goes AWOL from the Marines after rescuing his buddies in a tank, but then loses most of them in a friendly fire incident. It all makes for three men with lots of pent up anger and issues. Lots of issues.The relationship, or lack thereof, between Tommy and Brendan is not well explored or revealed. And other than dad Paddy acting like a drunk Nick Nolte, neither is that relationship well explained. There is just lots of ""history."" Fortuitously, they all end up in Atlantic City at ""Sparta""–the MMA world championship. Tommy and Brendan somehow repair their relationship by beating the living snot out of each other. It's a nice fairly tale.I guess.What was the story or point of all this? Nothing. Hardy clearly studied Rocky Balboa to work up his dumber than dirt demeanor and accent. He may deserve an award for doing a great Sly Stallone imitation. Other than that, I got virtually nothing from this movie other than some adrenaline rushed fight scenes. Having participated in martial arts for five-years, TMG left the theater wanting to go back in the ring for a round or two, but I settled for a few push-ups and a beer instead.Brendan's predictable relationship with his wife was kind of corny. Nolte played Nolte. I was impressed there was not a single male urination scene, thus the 0.0 P factor rating. The bell rang and I left."
"Eight months into the year and this is easily the best film of 2011 thus far and a sure Oscar contender. Saw an advanced screening at the Landmark in L.A. and haven't seen a reaction like that from an audience in a very long time. Cheering. People crying coming out of the theater. Very blown away. The performances are across-the-board phenomenal. Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton give movie star turns and should be nominated for Best Actor, and Nick Nolte hasn't been this good since AFFLICTION and should win Best Supporting. He's the best American actor never to win an Oscar and that should change this winter. Edge of your seat excitement, raw emotion, humor--WARRIOR does everything. Expectations weren't high going in (the trailer is very pedestrian and makes it look like a genre sports movie, which it isn't), but I was completely floored and wiped out by the end (a song by The National plays over the film's final scene and if it doesn't make you cry you're tougher than I am). Hats off to director Gavin O'Connor for this one. Not only is it better than THE FIGHTER, but it's on par with ROCKY and RAGING BULL and is something of a combination of the former's spiritedness and the latter's grittiness. Incredible movie."
"Whoa, this was terrible! Full of clichés, agonizingly boring. Be warned: only MMA fans will enjoy this.I read that some people are comparing this to Rocky, that is a laugh. Rocky keeps you going with a strong and well paced story, this is unfortunately laden full of clichéd seen before boredom, usually the kind you find in Steven Segal movies.Nick Nolte was the only redeeming character in this movie, his performance was fine, but not Oscar worthy. The rest of the cast is just so boring.If you're an MMA fan watch it, otherwise steer clear of this snooze fest.The 8.3 rating is very deceiving, the votes are most definitely from MMA fans.2/10"
"As this film is about fighting, one cannot help but compare it to other fight films that have gone in the past (Rocky, Raging Bull and more recently The Fighter), but I think it would be fair to say that film breathes fresh air on a genre which could easily produce films that are all a bit samey and prescriptive.This film has many things going for it, primarily the excellent performances by the three key protagonists, perhaps the best of all by Nick Nolte, as a reformed father longing for the forgiveness of his two sons. It's this story which really captivates you throughout the film. Yes the fight scenes are excellent, but it's the scenes between Hardy, Edgerton and Nolte that drives this film. It feels strange to say that Warrior's best scenes are not those inside the cage, but I think that is a good thing. Often within this genre you wish you could fast-forward to all the fights but to do that with this film would be to miss many memorable moments. The direction is good and it has a bold story with multiple subplots which i didn't expect. The violence isn't as graphic as you might expect but i think the 12A certificate explains why. Highly recommend this film, even for those who wouldn't normally choose to watch a fight film.Warrior is a well made beat 'em up drama that hits hard, but tugs even harder on the heartstrings."
"Alright, no exaggeration at all here, but I am now on my 6th session of attempting to complete this movie, that is how bad it is. I could not even get through 30 seconds of it and figured I would be better entertained writing a review for this awful movie. This movie has nothing to it!!- Horrible plot, horrible acting, stupid fight scenes, lame touches (trying to fit real UFC fighters into a completely made up scenario/tournament/fighters etc..) and the list goes on. Everything is just awful. Just awful. I have been training in MMA and competed in wrestling for about 10 years now and this movie is so inaccurate it makes me sick. Its as if the producers and writers of this movie have never even watched a fight before in there life & have not a clue about the sport. This movie is 100% just to excite viewers who have no knowledge of the sport, but a complete insult to fans. The fight scenes are just unexplainable and stupid. The fights are like if Amateur MMA and WWE, on steroids, had a child, who also took steroids, along with many other drugs, and then got in the ring. There are WWE ""moves"" used in this movie. They don't exist in the sport. Period. Enough Said."
"The Warrior A Movie Review By Nick Iacobucci Two brother's lives collide both inside and outside of the ring. Hello there everyone I'm Nick Iacobucci movie critic for ReelScreenReviews.com and our next movie review is the film The Warrior. This drama and sports film opened on September 9th, 2011, and it features Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton, Nick Nolte, and Jennifer Morrison. ""The Warrior"" comes to us from director Gavin O'Connor, the director of the Disney sports film ""Miracle"" and ""Tumbleweeds"" from 1999. This time out the director once again sets up the lights and cameras in order to capture a very popular sport, this time of MMA fighting.Our story tells of 2 brothers, one an ex-marine with coping issues, and the other a struggling school teacher. We soon learn that events from their past have pitted these two brothers against each other for quite some time, and they haven't even spoken to each other in years. Our marine Tommy soon invites the help of his father who's not only battled in and out of the ring as a manager, he has also battled with the bottle and alcoholism just as long. The other brother Brendan just cannot seem to provide for his family on his pay alone, so he also begins a fighting regiment and soon emerges not only as an underdog but a contender as well. With the success of each of the brother's climb to the top, this puts them on a collision course headed straight for each other. The movie then pretty much stops at nothing to give us a knock down drag out fight that provides new meaning to the term 'Sibling Rivalry'.Well people The Warrior seems to take what could be such standard and cliché material and elevates it to the next level. It accomplishes this by always keeping the sport in a secondary position to the storyline first. Now if I was to say that ""Warrior"" reminded me of other sports films, well that wouldn't be too much of a compliment in itself. However if I compare it to both ""Cinderella Man"" and ""The Natural"", which are not only fantastic sports films but are out-and-out 2 great films of the last 3 decades, that would be a compliment. Just as in Ron Howard's brilliant boxing drama ""Cinderella Man"" as this film plays out and is so engrossing with everything that is going on, you sometimes almost forget that you're even watching a sports movie in the first place. And most comparable to Robert Redford and Barry Levinson's baseball gem ""The Natural"", when you do finally come to reach the climatic finale you come to realize that there are many things more important than a title or a victory.Now I can't help but have some comparisons with this project to the very recent Marky Mark/Christian Bale movie ""The Fighter"", but I actually think that this is just as good if not better. There is not one throw away character in this film, and each actor has clear moments to shine and often does. Tom Hardy has this stern intensity about him, but he always seems anchored into the characters that he brings to life. He reminds me of a young Burt ReynoldsI mean going back to ""The Longest Yard"" or ""Deliverance"". He's an action star waiting to happen all trapped in the body of a great actor, and that is why Nolan keeps casting him in everything. Then Joel Edgerton rules every part of the big screen in every one of his scenes. You see and feel a lifetime of decisions, whether they are right or wrong, in every moment that he is on screen. They're also not simple characters but complex people that can even hide secret motivations to fight in the first place.In a back story involving Nick Nolte as their father, he also brings solid works once again to his resume. Nolte's dad also provides the motives that drove the family in separate directions so long ago, and a solid story brings them back together. Chance also brings very sound reasons for both brothers to enter and want to win the ""World Series"" of MMA fighting. Put simply people, the script never felt empty to me at all. Actually the only spot in The Warrior that seemed like a retread or a loophole was an internet video that depicted our one brother as an Army hero. This just so easily set the stage for him to enter the big tournament, and immediately be its 'Root-For Underdog'.At 2 hours and 20 minutes The Warrior should've felt much longer than it was, but with such talent putting it together it just clips right along. The fighting was almost an extension of the drama and connected the dots of this film beautifully. The combat that takes place in the ring was brutally real, vividly authentic, and in your face genuine. This film is exciting as it builds and builds to a showdown that will see a lifetime of blood, sweat, and tears come out of each corner.The Warrior has something for men, women, or anyone just looking to see a great film. I cannot recommend this movie enough, a perfect 4 stars out of 4.And thank you for your attention."
"I know 3D does not really take of, but does a movie have to be as one dimensional as this one? The moment the viewers were told the two brothers were going to fight in the same tournament, the outcome was foreseeable. I must admit that the sweat, the blood, the atrocity was all filmed very impressively, also thanks to the sound design, but the story is really very, very shallow. The good brother versus the bad brother. The wife opposing the fight, but turning like a leaf. The school principal opposing the fight, but turning like a leaf. The outsider, bound to win. The uncongenial favorite, who doesn't stand a chance against the hero. The no-good father, but still a rough diamond. The American fairy tale that, no matter how violent, the hero deserves our sympathy. I could go on, however, the only scene I anticipated, but to my surprise was not there, is the famous daddy-daddy scene; you know, the scene where the children run over a fresh green field to their victorious father, crying out ""Daddy, daddy!"" So, all in all, it could even have been worse..."
SPOILER: How can you show a underdog went on to win MMA. It is like Japan beating Spain to win world cup soccer.Even luck favors trained people. Just because he is motivated can win MMA is impossible.Even the background story is not properly covered and confusing.Better watch a million dollar baby. I can't believe that it got a rating of 8.3.It is real time waste of 2.5 hrs. A better fighting movie is undisputed redemption 3. the fight in it looks real and fighters look real. This is neither a motivational movie nor a entertaining movie.There are lot of movies based on fighting either show the real stuff with real fighter or make a beautiful motivational movie
"I think IMDb made a mistake writing this movie was made in 2011. It clearly is made in the early 1990's- the story, moral and World view proves that it is an early remake of every Jean- Claude Van Damme movie ever made up until that time. Also- it features a scary communist man from the threatening country of the Soviet union. This movie concentrates on telling the fantastic story of two American (the only nation that counts) brothers- sportsmen who go to war every time they step out on ""stage"", much like when Serena Williams or Roger Federer steps out on court in the U.S. Open and the chair umpire yells ""Fight!"" right before they open 1st set (Mortal Kombat later borrowed the idea). In the movie one of the brothers is a kind and good man (..actually they both are.. all men are good men.. wait- well they usually are in movies, right..?) and a loving husband and father, who doesn't want to fight but is left no option since an evil bank has ripped him off. Luckily he's American because in America regular people like that can moonlight (like Walter White does in Breaking Bad- to pay his medical bills in a country that saves its people from the evil grips of socialism) as one of the 16 BEST fighters in the world- which he luckily happens to be although he's hidden it for many years. The other brother who also happens to be one of the 16 BEST fighters in the world is an ex-soldier in that country of Iraq, where he bravely saved an American soldier and was considered a war hero (this I find confusing- don't you get to be a war hero when you kill people..? otherwise any like doctor could be a hero, right..?). He is very modest and a true Christian, because he does not care about fortune and fame. In fact, he changes his name and gets out of Iraq and into America under false pretenses (when you're American you don't need a passport- all you need to do is say you're American) so no one knows who he is. They both enter the greatest MMA tournament of the World (in America). Since the soldier brother doesn't have any family that he cares about or friends it's a good thing that he doesn't win the fighting tournament that occupies the last 1h of the movie, but his loving and fatherly brother does, the one who actually needs the money for his children and wife (who is useless, but looks like a supermodel- a typical American woman). The ending I really haven't seen in any other Hollywood movie except a Jean-Clause Van Damme movie or perhaps anything remotely related to Disney... or Steven Spielberg.. or anything from Hollywood that slightly resembles any of the previously mentioned. The movie is really great for people who are vacuum cleaning while watching it or simply has the level of a general American high- school education recently graduated or likes the story line in MacGyver (again, 80's)."
"Last night, my friends and I got together to watch a movie. We chose ""Warrior 2011"" because of its high IMDb rating. Was that a mistake? Absolutely YES!GOD! You cannot believe how boring a movie can be. A typical rocky-style story. Everyone can guess what will happen, from the beginning to the end. Watching the movie, we were looking forward something to put the story out of its misery, maybe a better acting or at least a different ending. Surprisingly, nothing special happened! Only a miracle could save the movie. What a waste of time. Did we feel amused? NO! Did we learned something new? NO! Do we recommend it to others? NO! I don't know how it could gain such a high rating.Whatever you do, stay away from ""Warrior""!"
"Can't believe the rating of this movie on IMDb. Apart from the acting by Hardy this is drivel. There's no depth whatsoever to the characters and that the two brothers would end up fighting each other is so predictable it almost cancels out the high school leveled biblical intentions. Even Rocky has great depth compared to this, all five of them.There's supposed to be severe hurt in the main characters of the story. Too bad it doesn't come through. The opportunity to really feel with the father and brothers never arise as they are given no time to become real people. They're just put in three formatted frames that everybody has seen at least 200 000 times before. One- the guy about to lose everything he's got and has to fight to survive. Two- the alcoholic trying to redeem himself and falls off the wagon when confronted with result of his previous life. Three- the barrel of rage in the form of a deserted son.All three very good ingredients to put in a movie-stew. But the taste of this one is sadly bland."
"I really had no intention of seeing this movie based on the trailer, but since we seem to be in a dry spell right now with no new big or must-see movies out there and because I saw that other people were giving this movie such high marks, I decided I should give it a shot.I was completely and pleasantly surprised at just how awesome this movie was. I am not into MMA or really any type of fighting/boxing at all in the real world, but you'll find that won't affect your enjoyment of this movie because the heart of this movie is about family and personal set-backs and overcoming obstacles and issues. There's no one out there who can't find someone/something to relate to in this movie.The story starts out at a slower pace and begins to build and build until the end - very cleverly crafted. I found myself actually reacting out loud in the theater to some of the fight scenes at the end, and as I said, I don't even really like MMA. But you really care for these characters and that's what makes the movie so engaging.The only other movie I've seen this year I'd put on the same level as this one is The Help. Warrior should at the very least get an Oscar Nomination for Original Screenplay with possibly a couple of actor nominees and best direction/picture nominees as well.Not much else to say except go see it for sure! I laughed. I cried. I grimaced. I cheered. If a movie can evoke that kind of emotion, what else can you ask for?!?"
"Went to see this movie with wife not knowing much about it at a sneak preview showing. I am a MMA fan, she is not. Both of us liked it very much, probably the best movie we seen this year and we go regularly. The director did a fantastic job getting great emotion/acting out of everyone and the way it was put together was very good. Even the fighting/stunts looked very real. Just read some negative reviews by critics about Tom Hardy in this movie, but they are very much off on this one, he did a great job. There is something special about this movie and the actors in it.Go see this movie, you will like it. Its not just a 'guy' movie, its has it all."
"OK, OK I understand there is no such thing as an unethical movie. But this has to come as close to proving there just might be such an animal. Truly sickening moments of awfulness. Which the actual sport avoids. Apart from the pathetic storyline and seriously misjudged opportunities to make a watchable film out of this mess, we have to tolerate wound up sequences of empathy squeezing, drivel dealing moments that make you want to eat your head off.If you last long enough to eke out your miserable Saturday night life to the finale, the only question is why did you do it? You already knew how ridiculous the plot was. Did you continue out of curiosity? Or sheer terror at realising how bad movies of this genre have now become? The fight sequences are beyond disbelief. They are Disneyland. I could make a tougher movie with my cam. The director tries to make these leaden humans worse on film than even the worst movie monsters of all time, but with such hubris he fails to make them more threatening than blow-up dolls. Without the sensible gore of, say, a decent movie like Rocky, it is mere mind-numbing torture. And I like fight movies. This is the worst film of any genre I have ever ever watched. And that's saying something."
"Enough of Boxing films already. Warrior brings us to the world of Mixed Martial Arts, which has been around for years, but never really making it to a notable big screen interpretation save for the Hong Kong film Flashpoint starring Donnie Yen taking down a string of bandits led by Collin Chou in the film's climatic finale. Perhaps its more contemporary slant meant a little less understanding of the art to effectively bring it to the cinemas, but Gavin O'Connor's film will open doors for MMA to work, and work well.Structurally it adopts from the many boxing films already out there where you know that bouts alone do not make a meaningful, moving film, without that degree of humanity and adversity, especially if coming from within family. providing avenues for some deep rooted family estranged ties to be addressed along the way. The story by O'Connor and Cliff Dorfman recognizes this key point, and stripped away of its violence, it's this emotional tussle the characters have to face up to that's more daunting than beefy opponents in the ring, providing Warrior its very crucial heart that keeps the film alive and pumping from the get go.Tom Hardy bulks up for this role and his next as Bane in Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Rises, and plays Tommy Conlon, a mean badass of a soldier who had deserted his comrades and made his way to his father's home, whom we learn is a no good drunk during Tommy's formative years, and hence comes the resentment. Needing a place to crash and then grudgingly engaging his dad's help to train him for an upcoming MMA tournament, Tom Hardy owned this role in providing that gruff exterior who has to make compromises in his life, and basically living with the enemy and with a closet full of skeletons that threaten to burst open as his profile becomes larger and more prominent given the public tournament.Then there's his brother Brendan (Joel Edgerton), a physics teacher and once MMA exponent whose soaring bills to pay to sustain a family led him to go back to moonlighting in underground bouts, much to the chagrin of his wife Tess (Jennifer Morrison), which is understandable since getting injured or killed, regardless of his assurances, would leave the family very much exposed and weakened. But one's paymaster is always extremely cautious about having employees moonlight on the side, and a choice has to be made whether to drop his interest totally, or decide to go serious with it especially with a five million dollar carrot dangling at the end of a large tournament known as Sparta, where winner takes all and each brother having their own reasons to have a crack at it.So you pretty much know how this is set up for the final act, but trust me the journey, and not the destination, is what Warrior excelled in, with wonderful powerhouse performances put in by Hardy, Edgerton and Nick Nolte, who plays their father now in his twilight years and hoping very much for his sons' forgiveness. This three way relations form the emotional crux of the film without which Warrior would have limped. With Hardy's and Nolte's middle act focused much on their training montage, Edgerton's character development piece was the more uplifting of the lot, and setting up the underdog role quite brilliantly as you'd soon find yourself rooting for him not to have his livelihood and lifestyle destroyed, putting himself forward for a once in a lifetime opportunity.The fight scenes during the Sparta tournament are what made this film stand out as far as action is concerned, providing that no holds barred front row seats as exponents slug it out in brutal fashion, each scheming, grappling, punching and kicking their way to an opponent's submission, or knock out. There are a lot of gladiatorial sport films out there, but Warrior had designed and crafted sequences that don't employ too much bullshit techniques used to cover up the lack of true ability. It is as convincing as it gets here, and you're bound to reel and feel for the fighters.But for all of its bite in the action sequences, Warrior makes a fantastic balance between the need to thrill, and having a soul through its more dramatic moments, thanks to the very well written roles that the various cast members managed to deliver. Highly recommended, and going into my shortlist as one of the best the year has to offer."
The movie would be much better if it was less pro USA. I liked the Idea. I love MMA but as an non-American this really spoiled it for me.First of all. You can see the movie is sponsored by the US Army. The army kid who is a hero. In the fight with his bro he looks at the army men in the audience and all sudden gains his strengths again. so cliché.Then again the bad guy is off course the Russian Koba. Hello?! Cold war is over. But the funniest and dumbest thing was that Koba enters the ring with a former Soviet Union flag?!?! The writers must have forgot the Berlin wall has been down since '89 and the Soviet Union doesn't exist.Off course wrestling is the base of both fighters. That didn't surprise me.Another thing. Brazilians rule MMA in the world and especially in the UFC. I haven't seen a Brazilian fighting in the whole movie? If you're an American teenager you'll like the movie. Too bad they didn't think off a broader audience.Have you seen Redbelt (2008)? A BJJ movie. Much better.Greetz.
"""Warrior"" was pretty good, not badly filmed and not badly acted. But that is it. That also describes many films that got less then 7.0 ratings at IMDb. I'm not sure why in the heck people are rating this as high as it is. Either a bunch of studio people got on here and posted ratings or a bunch of numb skulls who simply rate any fighting movie high did. Don't simply rate a movie high because you like the subject. Thats not really the point of the rating system. As others suggested this movie never did develop the three main characters much. There did not appear to be a deep enough reason for all the animosity that took place between the characters. Most of the movie was taken up by fight scenes. The creators of this movie needed to watch ""Rocky"" better as it had the formula correct for this type of movie. It was also kind of stupid that Tommy was still fighting with one arm in the end. The film was a little degraded due to that. Lets have votes from people who know all kinds of movies and not just action films."
"Despite what you may have heard or read, Warrior just may be one of the most melodramatic and manipulative films ever conceived. Yes, it is a sports movie and gets a pass from most people because of the genre's varied history. But that is not nearly a good enough excuse for the dreck that Gavin O'Connor has helped concoct with this film. The Conlon family has been irreparably damaged after years of abuse at the hands of the former boxer and alcoholic patriarch Paddy (Nick Nolte). He is trying his hand at sobriety, but his estranged son Brendan (Joel Edgerton) is not ready to let Paddy get too close to his family. Other son Tommy (Tom Hardy) has just mysteriously returned from fighting in the Middle East, and recruits Paddy to help train him as an MMA fighter in order to compete in an upcoming tournament with the best fighters in the world. At the same time, Brendan, a school teacher, begins training to fight in the same tournament in order to keep a roof over his family's heads.Should the trailer not have told you already, it becomes increasingly obvious throughout Warrior's often excruciating 140-minute running time where these two brothers are heading. The film makes no bones about it, and plays through almost every single underdog trope you can imagine and even a few you may have forgotten. The notion of being subtle was apparently lost on O'Connor, and I wonder if the original script played out just as annoying and silly as the film does. The comparisons to Rocky are more than fair, because the movie practically rips off entire segments right out of that legendary Oscar winner without shame. But looking aside from the formulaic and absolutely asinine plotting structure, as well as the clear jumps in logic on the parts of almost every single cast member (specifically towards the end of the film), I think the film is most guilty of being too long, too self-indulgent and just plain boring. Warrior lacks the charisma and finesse needed to really make you forget the predictability of it all and actually care about the plight of these characters. It beats you over the head with moments dripping with pathos and sorrow, but never answers the question of why you should care. It merely goes through the motions, playing out lengthy scenes that could have easily been cut for pacing or reworked to give us a reason for watching the struggles of this collapsed family. It fails to connect on almost every level, and merely feels like a stretched out, half-baked drama that drags its heels getting to the tournament the film is building towards. Even then, it still takes its time getting to the fights. I dig Hardy as an actor and look forward to seeing him truly break out, but he does not really put any effort into Tommy. He is brooding and conceited throughout, hinting at an inner pain that is waiting to be unleashed. But he never really gets the opportunity to showcase any of it. He spends most of the movie not saying a word, and merely looking at the camera or his cast mates with saddened and hollowed eyes. His sad eyes can only do so much, and his dialogue does absolutely nothing. It looks like he took the movie merely for the chance to bulk up and prep for The Dark Knight Rises. Edgerton, who I also look forward to seeing break out, does a little better. He actually puts in the effort needed to be convincing, and even with the atrocious dialogue, comes off as genuine. He takes even the worst of moments in stride, and does almost the entirety of the heavy lifting in the film. Should the film have focused entirely on him and cut out the silly brother subplot, I think it could have worked a whole lot better.Which brings me to Nolte, who gives what is likely his best performance in over a decade. While that may be true, I find it hard to find anything to really praise about it. He appears to be playing a fragmented archetype along the lines of Mickey Rourke's character in The Wrestler. Both characters are washed up shadows of their former selves, and not surprisingly, the lives of the actors playing them mirror the roles. But instead of giving the emotional breadth and genuine authenticity needed for this character, Nolte overacts the entire way through it. He hams it up for part of the film, and in others, completely destroys any semblance of attempting to give a great performance. Instead of letting it flourish, he seems more concerned with ensuring everyone know what kind of thespian he can be when he wants to be, and ends up becoming comically bad in some scenes. When there are people laughing at your character's most deadly serious scene, not because it is funny but because the delivery is stilted and amateur, it says a lot about the character and even more about your work.But for all of its problems and everything it does so horrifically wrong, the fight scenes at the end of the film are simply magnificent. They are raw and realistic. You can feel every punch, gasp at every bone crunching submission, and practically smell the sweat coming off the mat. You can sense immediately that great pains were taken to ensure these scenes looked as authentic as possible. You become immersed in them, and feel like you are right there in the scene. Not surprisingly, I completely forgot how long I had been sitting watching Warrior because these scenes were just so breathlessly entertaining. But after wading through almost two hours of melodramatic pandering, I think they deserved to be.4/10.(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com)."
"I will start off by saying that I am by no means a fan of MMA or any fighting sport for that matter but this film is outstanding, its about so much more than just fighting. This is about disjointed family who have not seen each other for years, they all have past or present problems that they need to put behind them and to forgive each other and move on.We see a lot of character development in the first hour or so which allows us to root for them as we get to the fighting stage, we know how much it means to them and therefore we care. It really is such an emotional ride.Excellent acting throughout especially from Tom Hardy who is absolutely incredible. My only fault with the film is that I would have liked an extra 5/10 minutes at the end of the film to see what happened to the characters after the final fight. But overall and excellent film.9/10."
"www.eattheblinds.comThe sports genre has become as much of a cliché as the many clichés it has spawned: Rocky's Theme, Eye of the Tiger, etc. At this stage of the game, breathing new life into this old genre and sucking in an audience while surprising them along the way, is next to a near impossible feat. Somehow, writer/director Gavin O'Connor has pulled it off with the MMA masterpiece Warrior. Despite its complete checklist of boxing film / sports movie clichés, Warrior reaches so far beyond these clichés it practically redefines them. While respectful to reference (the original) Rocky, O'Connor legitimizes Warrior as a serious film, crafting it with visual and thematic nods to Michael Cimino's grand epic The Deer Hunter. Simply put, this isn't a sports film for meatheads (not that it won't please them), this is a sports film for audiences hungry for stark cinematic realism.Burgeoning superstar Tom Hardy (once again) mesmerizes as the tortured lead Tommy Conlon, who -- along with Nick Nolte and Joel Edgerton -- make up a three headed beast with lethal acting chops. For a film I expected to detest, Warrior proved itself to be as big of an underdog champion as the unorthodox heroes it portrays."
"This films goes on for so long 2 hours and 20 mins of absolute rubbish!!!It is cage fighting rubbish, the school teacher beats all the bad guys and meets his brother at the endthe film is so cheesy and clichéRocky is a hundred times better, you can not comparesome plonker said its like all the rocky films rolled into one.Don't believe that rubbish.This movie is a silly cage fighting tournament, with boring characters you know the teacher will win from the start of the film its one of those under dog storiesso why wait 2 hours and 20 mins to see it happen????if you go to sleep for 2 hours and watch the last 20 mins of the film you will see all the best action and captured the whole story and reunion of brothersVery boring film again over rated by IMDb users"
"So basically - this is a proper movie. If you really like contact sports (which I do), Tom Hardy as character-actor (which I do as well), Joel Edgerton (which I do, too) and cute Jennifer Morrison (which I definitely do). But.To like this movie, you also have to like movies such as Armageddon and Independence Day (Which I don't). You have to be OK with ultimate predictability and really lame stereotypes, such as ""perfect-do-everything-for-family""-husband, drunk and hardball fighting-coach father, a rebel, wild, bitter - but conveniently war-hero - younger brother, supporting, against violence wife, who nevertheless got her chills out of the tournament (loyality, I guess), and bunch of loyal students + headmaster (which I'm personally definitely not). You have to accept everything heading towards some kind of balanced ending, judgment day. And you should love really loud music all the way, to get every last tear out of you. Well, I don't. So I would of rated this movie exactly the same as I rated Armageddon and Independence Day - with 1. But Tom Hardys superior effort to make his character really alive was standing out from this movie, there for it got 5 from me. 1 to the movie and 4 to Hardy."
"I am very disappointed in this and the reason is I thought it was gonna be a masterpiece. Honestly for the life of me I can not fathom how people liked this movie. Fault? the STORY! My main criticism is that the film is littered with any possible cliché you can imagine and then some, and for me it ruins the movie. The story is dragging and dragging the main characters compete one against each other for whom of the 3 lives the biggest tragedy when -think of it for a second- if they put aside their differences every one's problem will automatically get sorted out. On the positive side the fighting scenes are among the best as is the cast, and I also enjoyed the soundtrack.Long story short, this isn't a bad movie by any measure it is just so unoriginal. The Fighter, Rocky, Cinderella man, Raging bull. Every single plot twist and every character can be found among them. A nearly wasted Saturday night. Overall 5/10"
"Definitely no IMDb Top 250 material, this movie doesn't belong there.The movie is way to patriotic and the fighting scene(s) didn't impress, nor did the storyline and acting, the 'best' fighting scene was shown right at the beginning, thats where it should have ended, the rest was boring.I do not understand some of the reviewers here shouting THIS IS THE BEST SINCE ROCKY OR EVEN BETTER! It's just a sadly weak infusion, it doesn't keep you on the tip of your chair, instead you fight you're own battle against the boredom that's kicking in...better sleep it off and hope you will quickly forget what you just saw. Now that i'm thinking of it, that 5 was actually too generous of me......"
"I gave it a vote of 4 because I've seen this stuff before. This movie wasn't something you could consider a fighting movie, because the action is short and not shown.This is a movie where the main character is trying to earn money by fighting in a ring. Thrill, action and suspense have been replaced by drama.The plot is the fighter's relationship with his original family. And I don't think people who like drama will ever watch a boxing movie. There is no background provided for the people he's fighting. Our hero just goes and pummels his opponents and you're supposed to be impressed. This is an uninteresting movie. No thought was given to his opponents.This is just about a poor guy trying to get money for his family, while resolving his issues with his father. Even the fight scenes are pitiful, you can't really see anything as far as the action goes.I can't believe the IMDb score made me watch this crap. It's a drama. As anything else, it misses all points."
"I found this movie to be a predictable mushy mess full of clichés and obvious attempts by the director to tug at the heart strings of the viewer. Every combination was thrown at the viewer - father vs. son, son vs. son, family financial trouble, marital tension, etc. etc. It was numbing after a while. Oh, I almost forgot about a good dose of American flag waiving with the US military (reminded me a little of Transformers 3's disgusting false patriotism). The fight scenes weren't particularly compelling or interesting, as the final outcome could be seen a mile away. The actors gave good performances, but that's just not enough to save the movie from its awful script. Stay away."
