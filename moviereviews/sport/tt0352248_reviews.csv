"""Cinderella Man"" deserves to be placed alongside other great biographical films dealing with the lives and times of great boxers. Such films include ""Raging Bull,"" ""The Joe Louis Story,"" ""Ali,"" ""The Hurricane,"" and ""Ring of Fire: The Emile Griffith Story."" These films share in common not just a documentary-like approach to boxing or a superficial biopic. They also portray the human side of a modern gladiator and the culture that produced him. In the case of ""Cinderella Man,"" we are given a detailed and heart-rending portrait of the Great Depression in American. The story of the gentleman pugilist James J. Braddock is the backdrop to the larger drama of Americans' struggle in the 1930s.Russell Crowe provides a brilliant interpretation of Braddock, capturing the decency of a man whose career as a boxer would appear to have peaked at just the wrong time prior to the Crash of 1929. After that momentous event, Braddock's boxing went into decline just like the lives of millions of Americans. The scenes of Braddock and his family living in squalid conditions and with uncertainty about such basics as heat and electricity were carefully developed in the film. Renée Zellweger was outstanding as Mae, the caring but feisty wife of Braddock. Paul Giamatti was also excellent as Braddock's handler-manager, Joe Gould. Joe tries to keep up appearances by sporting fancy clothes. But in one revealing scene in the film when we see the interior of Joe's ostensibly swanky apartment, there is no fancy furniture other than a dowdy table and some flimsy deck chairs. Everyone is reeling from the Depression. In the depiction of the massive unemployment, the ""Hoovervilles"" of the homeless residing in Central Park, and the desperate need for Americans for an optimistic icon like Braddock to raise their spirits, the film truly captured the tragedy of the Great American Depression.The film's director Ron Howard emphasized close-ups throughout the film with uneven results. In many of the boxing sequences, the close-ups and rapid editing made it difficult tell the fighters apart. The close-ups continued even into the domestic scenes and the outdoor sequences depicting Braddock working as a longshoreman. The film's dark cinematography conveyed the bleakness of the Depression years, but it worked against bringing out the buoyant spirit of Braddock himself and the optimism that he instilled in others. As a director, Howard's strength is not in film artistry or technique. As apparent in this and other films, his gift lies in narrative storytelling and the development of dramatic character.Indeed, the characters and the story were the strong points of ""Cinderella Man."" Much credit should go to Cliff Hollingsworth for a screenplay that included thoughtful dialogue, humor, and multi-dimensional characters. Daniel Orlandi also merits praise for the brilliant costumes that helped to recreate the period of the early 1930s.But the heart of this film experience is Russell Crowe's screen portrayal of Braddock. It was the colorful sportswriter and raconteur Damon Runyan who coined the nickname of ""Cinderella Man"" for Braddock. However, the real James J. Braddock was more than lucky. It was his strength of character in and out of the ring that captivated America. One of the most moving scenes of the film was a heated argument between Braddock and his wife Mae where Braddock insists that even in the most difficult of times, he would refuse to be separated from his children. As a boxer, he was fearless. But he demonstrated even more courage in fighting for family valuesa lesson from which we can learn a great deal today in reflecting on this sensitive film."
"The dilemma: I hate boxing movies; I love Russell Crowe movies. I've already seen ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Raging Bull"" this year, and accidentally watched part of one of the ""son of Rocky"" serial movies on a Saturday afternoon. I feel like I am being punched, as Renee' Zellwegger's character Mae Braddock says, and I'm not as tough as these prize fighters.But this one has Russell Crowe in it. And that makes all the difference. It is not that Renee Zellwegger and Paul Giamatti, Paddy Considine, Bruce McGill and Craig Bierko, among others, give less than stellar performances: they all live up to their justifiably great reputations. You have to believe they are at the top of their game. But for all of Russell Crowe's reputation for being ""difficult"", it is hard to think of actors who can equal his personal force on the screen. He is brilliant. Ron Howard has made of the real life of Depression-era prize-fighter James J. Braddock a work of art. The camera work is phenomenal. Without using violins or cliché' pull-back shots showing the numbers of people homeless and in soup lines, Howard makes the Depression a visceral reality with scenes of near-hopeless men at the docks, pleading for a day's work; a stolen salami; Crowe's giving his daughter his breakfast piece of bologna, telling her he dreamed he was full. The bleakness of the times is the graininess and the sepia/greyness of the camera shots; the images are stark but completely descriptive. Crowe as Braddock with hat in hand and tears in his eyes, begging for twenty dollars so he can get his children back into his home, is the personification of pride sacrificed to desperation. But when Braddock is later asked at a press conference why he is fighting at his age and after so many poor showings, all he has to say is ""milk"" to be supremely eloquent.Doubtless many people know the history of James Braddock, and know the outcome of his fights, including the championship bout with Max Baer, who had already killed two men in the ring. If you don't know, DON'T look it up before you see the movie, and if you DO KNOW, DON'T TELL, but go. Analogous to watching Howard's film ""Apollo 13"", you may know the outcome, but there's wonderful suspense in the details. These were among the most exciting last twenty minutes I've seen on film. I didn't expect to be able to watch, but like Braddock's terrified wife Mae, I was unable to tear myself away.The audience was like a prize fight audience, cheering, booing, gasping, groaning during the fights. We applauded Braddock's wins, suffered his defeats. It is a great movie, with authentic heart. Solid A."
"My heart was firmly lodged in my throat for the last hour and a half of The Cinderella Man. Nobody does true-story heroism like Ron Howard, and few can do heroes like Russell Crowe. Though Howard fictionalizes his subjects, and does not pretend to make documentaries, he does accurately depict the feeling and the major points of his subjects. Jim Braddock was a depression-era boxer who everybody thought was down for the count. Though there is a lot of boxing in this film, this is not a boxing movie, but rather his story and the story of the family that inspired him to fight back against prejudice and hopelessness, to rise to heights that would inspire a nation. Braddock is portrayed in a moving and powerful manner, with remarkable performances all around, one of the best scripts I can remember in recent years, and occasionally brutal action.Those who have run into my reviews may note that this is one of my shortest. Please understand that I really don't think there's much to say about this simple, beautiful and very human story, besides - see it!"
"Geez, another boxing movie! Yeah, Yeah, I know the story. Down and out guy gets a break and makes the most of it. He's fighting for his family, he's fighting for all those other hopeless people. Been there, done that.Oh, I forgot to mention one thing. This movie is about the best 140 minute I've spent in a movie theater since . . . . since . . . ., Oh, well, you get the picture. Better yet, instead of getting the picture, go see it.Russell Crowe owns the character of James Braddock, the unlikely hero who makes the most of his second chance. He's a good fighter turned hack. Injury, bad luck and this thing called the Depression sends him down the drain.His wife, Mae, played by Renee Zelleweger, wants to be his biggest fan, but the kids need a dad, the rent has to get paid and the money from boxing dried up along time ago. Her husband's courage is undoubted, but his nerve is killing her.And then there's Joe Gould, played by Paul Giamatti.A boxer by the name of George Cochan once told me his manager was the bravest man he ever knew, he was willing to pit his man (Cochan) against anyone. As a result, Cochan had his head handed to him multiple times by the likes of Jake LaMotta and other class middle weights of the Forties and Fifties. Gould, is that brave manager, if not literally, in spirit. He pits Braddock, out of shape and with one day notice, against the number two heavy weight contender. Regardless of the risk, it's a pay day needed by both Gould and Braddock.The story, while familiar, is executed brilliantly. The camera work is both subtle and, in turn, spectacular. Craig Bierko, Paddy Considine, Bruce McGill and the rest of the cast give flawless performances.Yes, been there, done that! And I'm ready to do it again for anyone who wants to go with me."
"Crowe is perfectly likable as the 'Pride of New Jersey' and the champion of his wife's heart, being knocked down by the stock market crash of '29 and a broken right hand Jim Braddock (Crowe) is compelled to feed his family with whatever work he could get on the Jersey docks However, thanks to a last minute cancellation and some effort by his close friend and longtime trainer, he found himself back in the ring Knowing now that the difference between winning and losing is how much food and warmth he can provide for his wife and kids, Jim finds the motivation that he needed to win the matchCrowe conveys with great sincerity the feeling of desperation of a humble man giving his all to his family and his profession as a boxer At his lowest moment, Braddock swallows the last of his pride and goes before the Boxing Federation who fired him from boxing (because he hasn't been winning, mostly due to injuries), begging them for pocket change to buy ""milk"" for his children In this powerful scene, we truly feel the harsh reality of those timesCrowe is tremendously appealing in scenes depicting his tender relationship with his children: His care while telling his hungry little daughter about his dream of a thick juice steak persuading her to eat his meager supper because he is too full to eat it, his love when promising his oldest son, Jay, he'll never send him away, no matter how bad things get The supporting cast is exceptional:Renee Zellwegger is very good as Braddock's adoring wife She is a soft-spoken blond, shy-eyed type, who remains strong no matter how much force is exerted against it, making do with watered-down milk Her need to let Jimmy fight, and to bring money to pay the bills, always gets shattered by her fear that one day he will walk out the door to leave her a widowPaul Giamatti is terrific as the fast-talking boxing manager trying to keep up appearances of success amidst the depression Craig Bierko amuses but terrifies as the much-feared Max Baer whose pleasant face masks the heart of a man who will do anything to win The film makes Baer out to be an arrogant figure, who enjoys beating and even killing his rivals in the ring Seeing Braddock's wife Mae, Baer utters, ""She's too young to be a widow."" With dramatic images of the Depression Era, Howard's ""The Cinderella Man"" is a fine boxing motion picture, very entertaining and sentimental The boxing sequences are wonderfully photographed, bringing the audience right into the ring We can really feel the cool, oily, smoky sweatiness of the ""world's most famous arena."""
"This is a truly great film. Russel Crowe, Rene Zellweger and Paul Giametti were all fabulous. Russell Crowe is the best actor of our time. I am not a boxing fan, but I was so engrossed by the character of the Cinderalla Man that I was totally involved in every punch. I didn't know how the story would end, so I had the added thrill of suspense during the final fight.The story of a family in the midst of the Great Depression was as compelling as the boxing story. The solid family man played by Russell gives us a much needed role model. The historical and socio-economic background was powerfully shown and greatly added to the audience's involvement and is particularly relevant to today. This is a classic film."
"Before I get to whether or not I liked this film, the history teacher in me thinks it's very important to set the record straight. Although the film is pretty accurate when it comes to the career of James Braddock, it's very inaccurate in portraying his opponent, Max Baer. The champion, Baer, is shown as a sadistic jerk who killed two men while boxing--and really delighted in taunting Braddock about this. In the film, the evil and filthy-mouthed Baer tells Braddock to bow out of the fight, as he could be the next to die in the ring--and he really seems to LIKE tormenting Braddock's wife about this. In reality, Baer killed one man in the ring. It was a horrible accident which occasionally happens in boxing--one which apparently haunted Baer for the rest of his life. In fact, he helped pay for his dead opponents to get educations and looked after this family--hardly the act of a sadist. I understand why the folks who made ""Cinderella Man"" changed this in an attempt to create tension, but the story would have STILL worked great if it had just stuck to the truth. Plus, think of how this film affected Baer's relatives when they saw it. Max Baer Jr. ('Jethro' from ""The Beverly Hillbillies"") knew his father was not like this and I am sure it pained him to see him so badly misrepresented.As for the NON-Baer parts of the film, they are great. The look of the 1930s is exceptional--much more realistic than you often see in films. Also, the acting is terrific, the film VERY engaging and the story of Braddock very compelling. Without the misrepresentation of Baer's in the story, I would have given this one a 10. Really....it's that compelling and they did a great job. The acting, direction, designs...everything but the writing was perfect.By the way, this isn't so much a complaint as an observation. In this movie, like practically EVERY other boxing movie, there is hardly any defense (such as blocked shots) in the boxing matches--punch after punch that lands on the opponent. If fights REALLY were like this, they'd rarely go beyond the first round!"
"If the great depression of the 1930s is a mystery to you, then Cinderella Man can fix that. The story, about the ups and downs in the career of a boxer, is uplifting and entertaining. However, what makes this film more than that is its believable depiction of the great depression.The sets look similar to pictures I have seen in books I read about the depression, and the costumes are correct. But this is not just a ""period piece."" The behavior of everyone in the cast, and every extra, shows dedication to reproducing the gestures and attitudes I have observed in people I have personally known who lived through the depression.Take, for example, the scene at the dock where Braddock, the boxer, waits with dozens of other men for the chance to work a stevedore job for the day. ""We need ten,"" shouts the boss. Then he points, and counts. Every eye is trying to meet his, trying to be picked. Not a gesture is out of place.This kind of verisimilitude comes only from fanatics for accuracy. Look at drector Ron Howard and male lead Russell Crowe. Ron Howard also directed Cocoon, Willow, and -- for the Academy Award for Best Director and the Academy Award for Best Picture -- A Beautiful Mind, which also starred Crowe. He drove the set designers, the costumers, the cast, and the extras, with telling effect. Nothing is over-acted.Crowe trained for the film using the same, low-tech methods used in boxing in the 1930s. He also studied film footage of Braddock to master the real fighter's characteristic gestures. In the ring, said one of Crowe's trainers, he successfully duplicated Braddock's moves, his footwork, and his style.The boxing drives the story along. It is bloody, fierce boxing. Some people may find the fight scenes objectionably violent. Crowe broke his hand in training. Real fighters played most of his opponents. Sometimes they forgot they were supposed to fake punches, leading to the spilling of real blood, which was left in the final version. Crowe also landed a few real punches by mistake.The boxing, however, is overshadowed by life during the depression. Millions were out of work. Milk was delivered in bottles, by a milk man. People left their empty milk bottles out at night so the milk man could collect them early the next morning, and replace them with full bottles. When the dairy could no longer extend a family's credit, the empty bottles were still there in the morning with a note of apology stuck in the mouth of one of them.During the depression, there was no unemployment insurance, no Medicaid, and no Social Security. There was the dole, but it was new, humiliating, and under funded. You cold not get enough to keep your family fed and clothed.Braddock is shown waiting for and getting his dole, another moving scene in which everyone is stoically in character. The film also accurately depicts the huge gap that opened between the masses of the poor, and the few, fabulously wealthy.This is a very entertaining film. However, if you are just beginning to study the great depression, it can be a a great head start."
"I saw this film on May 17th in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival that screens films for their Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture ""...explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life."" Heartland gave that award to this film.The impact of this film on the viewer is as powerful as Rocky and Million Dollar Baby. While all three films have boxing and love of the underdog as a common theme, this movie is much more. The backdrop of the movie is Depression-era America around NYC. And you are taken back to this depressing and hopeless time of willing, hard-working, idle, discouraged, poor people.The threesome of Russell Crowe, as the fighter Braddock, and Renee Zellweger, as his wife, and Paul Giamatti, as his manager were Academy-Award worthy. They professionally played their parts and let the story be the real star.Braddock is a down-on-his-luck aging and hurt boxer who can no longer box and can no longer find enough work to support his wife and three kids. By a twist of fate, he is given another chance to fight, and his career begins again.Braddock and his wife display low-key dignity and honor that we wish we all had. They are good spouses, parents, neighbors and citizens without ""showing off."" While this is a serious drama, it has a lot of light humor throughout the picture that is entertaining and appropriate. Director Ron Howard does a wonderful storytelling job and has kept directorial tricks to a minimum. The fight scenes were the most real I have seen in any movie.This is film-making at its best.FYI - There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past winners going back 70 years."
"This is the best film Ron Howard has ever done. They really caught lightning in a bottle with this one. All the departments brought their A game to the table. I especially loved the editing and cinematography.The cast is perfect and, under Ron Howard's confident hand, all give amazing performances. Russel Crowe's soulful performance puts him back in Maximus territory here and, boy, was this cat born to play these types of roles. Bruce McGill is in it (San Antonio, represent!!!) and that's always a good thing.My only complaint (if it can be called that) is that the boxing sequences break no new ground. They are very reminiscent of the boxing sequences in Raging Bull. They are so well executed, however, that I quickly forgot about this small nitpick.The script works on so many levels, it's not even funny. There is plenty of time devoted to character development and it pays off handsomely in the long run as we really care about Jim Braddock every time he steps in the ring.All in all, Cinderella Man is a rousing, classy film that utterly satisfies."
"I also went to a sneak preview of this movie last night, and it was good enough for me to join this site and write my first review. It did start out kind of slow, but the complete rainbow of emotions was contained in this movie. There were parts that nearly made you cry. There were parts that made you laugh out loud. I could barely contain my excitement during the last 15-20 minutes of the movie, I just wanted to scream out loud I was so excited. When we left the theater there was a ~60 year old woman delicately shadow boxing on her way out the door. Her husband asked her, ""Are you winning?"" She said, ""I'm going to have dreams about this movie tonight."" This was a great movie, and I would recommend it highly."
"Just saw a preview of this film (opens June 3) and as shamelessly emotional as it is, I liked it very much. It provides a more visceral view of the Great Depression era than did another fine film, Seabiscuit. Call it Seabiscuit with even more heart! Ron Howard teams with Russell Crowe (James J. Braddock) again and shows they can repeat with a winner. Like him as a person or not, Crowe puts forth another finely tuned, very convincing performance. Unlike in real life, he can be quite humble and sympathetic while beating the heck out of people. Really, his character is affecting, especially in his scenes with Braddock's children, and may be fairly reflective of the actual person of Braddock. (The fight game at that time, or any time, was not for saints but, whatever.) Renee Zellweger, who is not my favorite except for a brilliant portrayal in Cold Mountain, plays the wife effectively and mirrors the emotions for the females in the audience. (If my observations at the showing are typical, women fans will spend time alternately heading their eyes and virtually cheering out loud for Braddock/Crowe.) There are a number of good supporting actors but Paul Giamatti strikes again! He plays the manager who supports Braddock through thick and thin and his character recalls the era better than anyone in the film. I don't know what kind of research he did for this role but his Joe Gould is the archetypal boxing manager of the time or, at least, our cinema image of one. Here's hoping he pulled some big bucks for a role for once.(You will certainly recognize Bruce McGill, as the seemingly hard-hearted fight promoter who could care less about Braddock but really doesn't want to see him get killed in the ring, from many movie and TV appearances where he is always reliable and who may be remembered from an early exposure as ""D-Day"" in Animal House.)"
"Cinderella Man is the story of a Depression-era boxer and American hero Jim Braddock, but it contains enough love interest, family interest, and great-champion-of-the-people interest to satisfy most Saturday night out filmgoers. It's a total no-brainer, beautifully served up, and all the clichés delivered with such accurate emotional punch that you forgive it for being a tad unoriginal.Gladiator and bar-brawl man Russell Crowe plays the lead role and Renée Zellweger puts in a good performance as the ideal and very loving wife that supports her husband through thick and thin. The story starts in 1928 when Braddock is doing quite well, but the depression hits and, with an injured hand, he is forced to work in the shipyard. He and his family live in fairly abject poverty until a lucky break enables him to make a comeback.This is the working man's hero who never says a bad word, teaches his kids never to steal for food even when they are starving, and nobly gives back his social security money the minute he can afford to. Zellwegger is similarly faultless of course, striking the right balance between supportiveness and concern that her man could get his brains knocked out permanently. The last fight generates quite a lot of genuine excitement due largely to neat editing and intense cinematography - you can almost feel your nose bleed just watching it.This is classic American-style hero creation and worship and, on the face of it, healthy enough. So why the doubts? Sure you can sit back and just enjoy it, it's the type of story the U.S. has done well for a long time; but compare it with European cinema and it all seems very full of absolutes. The heroes don't have any failings. The choice is between total success and total failure, no half measures. Much as I admire the use of role models, I somehow wonder if more human heroes aren't sometimes called for, people who do quite well, who sincerely better themselves and others, but without becoming the most applauded individual on the continent. In watching the big picture we sometimes miss the detail that makes life real to everyone, not just the lucky few."
"I went to a preview screening here in Minneapolis last night, 5/5/05. They said that we were the first people in Minnesota to see the move. Well, let me just say that this is one of the best movies that I've ever seen - Russell Crowe and Ron Howard have done it again! It starts a bit slow, but it gives you background into the life of Jimmy Braddock, a once great boxer who fell into hard times because of the great depression. Him and his family experienced all the heartaches that everyone else did at that time.Even though he retired from boxing (he was viewed as a joke), his manager (Giamatti) got him one fight against a #1 contender to the belt. Everyone expected Jimmy to lose....I'll leave you to see the movie from here on out! Everyone was SUPERB in their roles, and there's no reason that Crowe, Giamatti, Zellweger, and Howard shouldn't be up for nominations. It was an outstanding movie, my heart was POUNDING during the last 15 minutes. After the movie, everyone stood up and cheered...EVERYONE! It was fabulous, and plan on seeing it again when it comes out Nationwide. Go see this movie!!!!"
"We went to this movie today at Albuquerque, New Mexico. My first impression upon looking at the title was ""sounds kinda girly movie"". I have no idea who Jim Braddock is until I saw this movie. Its truly inspiring and amazing. All actors excelled in their action. Its gripping all the way till the end. I don't want to tell the story and spoil the spirit. It was never boring the entire movie.Russell Crowe once again lived up to the expectations and did a very good job. Renee Zellweger played the role of a very supportive wife. Its about never giving up, fulfilling for your promises, staying together what may come, to fight back etc., Watch it and you won't regret I promise."
"Wow, this was an involving story and the best boxing movie I think I've ever seen, and I've seen most of them. It's an old-fashioned underdog rags-to-riches sports story about a very likable hero, heavyweight boxer James J. Braddock, played fantastically by Russell Crowe. This is another ""Seabiscuit,"" meaning a true-life tale of longshot going up against extraordinary odds. More than the boxing, however, this is a great family story of a devoted husband and father and a loving, supporting wife and mother. That's the crux of this biography, more than the boxing angle. Nothing but the highest of morals and ethics are espoused by our hero here, who would starve himself rather see his children miss a meal, while teaching his kids honesty and unselfishness and doing whatever it took to take care of his family. Renee Zellweger also shines as Braddock's wife. After a string of some sleazy roles, it's nice to see Zellweger play this type of character. The two make an inspiring couple which is refreshing to see in this age of cynical film-making. This is another reason why I label this an old-fashioned story. The primary subject's strengths, not flaws, are emphasized.Is it exaggerated? Probably, but I have no complaints seeing a good guy look better instead of worse. One gets tired of the modern-day age of the ""anti-hero."" It's nice once again to see a good man propped up instead of shot down.The third major character in the film is ""Joe Gould"" (Paul Giamatti), Braddock's trainer and loyal friend. Unfortunately, he spits out the Lord's name in vain so many times I lost count, the only objectionable aspect of this film. But Gould was the kind of friend every guy would want.Craig Bierko gets fourth billing as Max Baer, the reigning heavyweight champ whom Braddock has to beat to get the title. Now here is where I would not be surprised if his movie character was nothing like real life because Hollywood has to have a ""bad guy"" to counteract the ""good guy"" so here it is Baer, the last obstacle in the way of Braddock's quest to be heavyweight champion. Whatever the real Baer was like I don''t know but I know Bierko does a great job in this role.The boxing scenes, supervised by real-life Hall Of Fame trainer Angelo Dundee, are lifelike and well-done. Crowe did a wonderful job of imitating Braddock's ring style.The story isn't the only thing that is entertaining. Visually, this is a wonderful treat for your eyes. It's simply beautiful and director Ron Howard really excelled in capturing the 1930s Depression era with some beautifully muted colors. The sets are fantastic and the clothing, cars, buildings, etc put you smack in the middle of the 1930s. There are great production values in this film and the DVD does it all justice with a fabulous transfer on widescreen DVD."
"With Ron Howard directing and Russell Crowe, Renee Zellweger, and Paul Giamatti starring, Cinderella Man was sure to be a worthwhile cinematic experience, if only it hadn't been released in the unsuitable summer months of blockbuster fever. It didn't help that previous DreamWorks summer hit Seabiscuit starred a horse (and was more emotionally uplifting without being too violent or predictable), or that Cinderella Man was preceded by last year's Oscar winner Million Dollar Baby or the lackluster NBC reality series The Contender. But even when taken out of context, Cinderella Man is a fine, elaborately and accurately produced (if minimalistic) Depression-era boxing-pic love story that simply doesn't go where no great movie hasn't gone before.Crowe, as always, gave a studied performance that reflected his involved physical and mental preparation, not to mention his accent! Zellweger, I thought, was the most underrated of the bunch because she really held her own opposite Crowe, stealing many of his scenes as the heart-tugging emotional core of the story. Giamatti's supporting perf should earn him his first (and overdue) Oscar nomination, since it was a fun, snarky kind of role infused with vigor and heart - great for a character actor. Otherwise, though, Ron Howard's direction might have made an already unoriginal subject matter more predictable. Still, it was, without a doubt, a good movie, if not a great one - a film that was well-made, if neither innovative nor emotionally sweeping."
"I've lost a lot of tears on this movie. Don't know exactly why but it must be the choice between dignity and family (wife and children). It's ""beautifull"" to see that 2 people stand a long time on their love. But in this movie you get a view of results of the depression, where hunger and soberness is normal. Maybe the story sounds like the Rocky sequence but this is different stuff. The come back and suffering from the early 30's can't be compared to the Rocky culture.I always have problems with macho guys. In this movie the hero isn't one.Well, I loved every minute of this movie. Thanks Ron Howard."
"This is definitely my favorite dramatic movie of all time and it totally berates me on why no Oscar love. Award shows are tainted anyway, so who cares right? I don't. Anyway, where do I begin? Russell Crowe is absolutely incredible, he captures the essence of James Braddock like none other could, he made you feel the character as if it were your own father or brother, quite like nothing I have ever seen before. Renee Zellweger is my girl, and I have loved her so much more since this. The casting was perfect, the story was perfect, cinematography was perfect, the acting was perfect. It was just a perfect movie. I never did like Ron Howard, but I gotta give it to you man... this will be the best movie you will ever create, as it cant get much better than this."
"Readers of some of my comments might guess that I am not terribly impressed with Ron Howard as a producer or director, and that one of his projects will go down in my memory as an insult. So it should tell you a lot about the quality of Cinderella Man that I found it an enjoyable and moving film. It is not without its faults, granted, but its strengths are great enough that this mostly does not matter. I thought that it could have been better if Howard had not resorted to bowdlerising his subject at the expense of an opponent, but as I said to a fellow viewer the night I saw it, it could have been much worse. Like many films that star Russell Crowe, Cinderella Man literally balances itself upon his shoulders, and it gets very comfortable there for once. Crowe has been carrying films on his individual strength since almost the beginning of his career, so it should come as no surprise that he handles this with expert poise. He may have a reputation for being difficult to work with, but he also produces results that are well worth it.The Great Depression was a time of many things, mostly variations on misery, and Cinderella Man does not let up for one minute in depicting this. The biggest challenge of a film about boxing is giving the central character a reason to box, and this film nails that from the get-go. In an interview before the climactic fight, we hear Braddock tell the press that he is doing the fight because he wants to be able to buy milk. There are few people in today's English-speaking world who know anything resembling such desperation. Most of them only know it because of how they were born a little different to those in power. Anyway, the second challenge of a boxing film is to make the audience feel as if they are part of the match. Howard apparently accomplished this partly by placing a camera in a protective case and having his actors punch that. In other places, he uses the viewpoint of the character, or just films the action from the appropriate angle. Granted, some of the camera-work was a bit on the nose, so to speak, but it was mostly effective. If nothing else, Ron Howard knows how to simulate a fight for a film.Renée Zellweger gives a surprisingly good performance as Mae, the wife of Jimmy. At one (possibly more) point of the film, she tells Crowe that when he is in the ring being hit, it feels to her like she is being hit. Most of the time, when you hear the long-suffering wife character say something like this, it is comical. That one can fully empathise with Zellweger as she says this in Cinderella Man is testament to how well-scripted and well-acted her scenes with Crowe are. Paul Giamatti also gets to shine as Braddock's manager, Joe Gould. For much of the film, we see Gould as being simply a trainer and facilitator, looking down his nose at the thoroughly working-class Braddock. Then in one amazing scene, we learn just how intense the pinch of the Great Depression really was, and how much Gould really had invested in what he thought up until recently was a man past his prime. In a sense, the film works especially because of how powerful a performance these two put in.The weak spot in the film is the portrayal of Max Baer. Yes, Max was a mountain of muscle who loved to punch his opponents into submission. Yes, Max killed two men in the ring. Where Cinderella Man errs is that it portrays Max Baer as having bragged extensively about the incident, even to the point of insulting Braddock's wife. Baer's son claims that Baer senior was haunted by the death of his opponent in the ring, and often wept about it. There is some corroboration to this account, but even without it, one has to consider that killing opponents in the ring and bragging about it is bad for a boxer's business. Not to mention that it is difficult to believe a man born in 1937 would say this about his dad if there weren't a fair chunk of truth to it. The essential problem here is that Howard's film portrays Max Baer with no development and no second dimension. He is a caricature, and thus Jimmy Braddock's victory in the climactic scene is lessened by it. I won't go into all the films that have been made better by multidimensional villains, but I was quite disappointed by this lapse. It is shared by all Howard films, which cannot seem to function without the good guys being very good and the bad very bad.It is for that reason I gave Cinderella Man an eight out of ten. It is not nearly in the same league as Crowe's other riches-rags-riches combat performance, but it is worth a look. With the competition it was up against, in fact, I am surprised it failed to make more money."
Its about the depression era in US when a veteran boxer has to fight again to feed his family. He had seen good days but depression took everything.He fights again to win matches and its about survival this time not entertainment.He got to keep standing till the end (in the ring) to buy heating n food fr his children because he had promised them that he wont be sending them away...n even when he is famous n reporters crowd around him asking how he felt he was humble enough to reply 'i was doing it to buy milk'....its a real story n a touching one. Its names so because he was called Cinderella man as he was a ray of hope fr all the others struggling through the depressions to try n make ends meet...
"I was looking forward to Cindella Man for over a year, I was disappointed when it was postponed from last December, and I was thrilled to be able to make a special showing last Sunday. Generally, when I go in with high expectation (and this film was the one I was most looking forward to this year) I come out more than a little disappointed, although the films are often good, they rarely live up to my rampant anticipation. Cinderella Man, however, exceeded all my expectations. Russel Crowe, who, since Master and Commander has been my favorite actor, outdoes any of his performances to date. He has clearly lost weight, he seemingly effortlessly picked up an accent, and his attitude is flawlessly proud, browbeaten, and unendingly strong. When he first loses his license to box at the beginning of the film he conveys, without shoving anything in our face, his sense of disappointment that he cannot provide for his family. He works furiously on the docks with a broken hand and still cannot keep his house heated. So at last, in one of the most moving moments of the film, he does what he would almost rather die than do, goes to his old friends and asks them for money. I do not want to give away too many details of the film. But I can say, it is the best in years and, although i doubt it will because of A Beautiful Mind, it should win more than a few Oscars."
"""In all the history of the boxing game you find no human interest story to compare with the life narrative of J J. Braddock"".Damon Runyan.Rags to riches films are notoriously divisive amongst critics and fans alike, often tagged derogative wise as Awards Baiters, one could be forgiven for thinking that uplifting pictures have no place in cinema society. On the surface, Cinderella Man was always going to struggle to totally capture the movie loving world. It's directed by Ron Howard, who seems to forever be charged with the crime of lacing his puddings with too much sugar, and it's written by the person who brought us Batman & Robin! So not a good start there for many. Add into the equation that Russell Crowe stars as Braddock, at a time when Crowe was gaining unfavourable press for anger issues and a love of poetry: And also that it's yet another boxing movie, this film was disliked before it had even been released. Which is a mighty shame as the finished product is a triumph of acting and story telling nous, in fact inspiring probably isn't the word to do it total justice.Much like with Apollo 13, Howard has managed to grab a story with a known ending and mold it into a heavyweight champion of a picture. Set as it is in the Great Depression, the amount of sentiment and heart tugging is naturally very high, but what would you have Howard do? Forgo the feeling of the time and Braddock's real life situation? Perhaps in favour of filler scenes that have no actual worth? Cinderella Man has no agenda other than to tell this incredible story of a good honest family man struggling to make ends meet. With a heart of a lion and a chin quarried from granite, Braddock {brilliantly realised by the irrepressible Crowe} went from top to bottom and rose like a phoenix to defy the odds and stun the boxing world at a time when morale was particularly low for many. This is no Rocky Balboa bunting strewn fanfare picture, this is a real story, from a real period, expertly told by all involved.This is not to say that Cinderella Man is a perfect piece, it most definitely isn't. My personal complaint rests with not fully fleshing out the friendship between Braddock and Mike Wilson, with the almost unforgivable crime of underusing the talent of Paddy Considine {Wilson} entered on to the charge sheet. Craig Bierko as the murderously ruthless champion boxer, Max Baer, has obviously studied the character, getting the movements of the champ down pat, but he just never fully convinces as a real life boxer of note, something that Crowe most assuredly manages to do. But they are minor quibbles to me, and offset by the wonderful Paul Giamatti as Braddock's trainer Joe Gould, every sequence featuring just him and Crowe are real cinema high points; an acting tour de force from two very talented men. A special mention has to go to Renee Zellweger, who as Braddock's devoted wife, gets arguably the toughest role in the picture, that she leaves a firm and emotionally enlightening impression is with much credit to the pretty and undervalued Texan.Rags to riches films are here to serve a purpose, they exist and will continue to be made because the world sometimes needs reminders that love, hope and respect can reign supreme, especially in trying and troubled times. Cinema is actually a form of medicine, especially when grounded in facts. Is it right to deny yourself a tonic when the need arises? Of course not, thankfully those involved with Cinderella Man knew exactly what to prescribe for the story of J J. Braddock. 9/10"
"A magnificent production brought to us bye the genius of Ron Howard who we all owe many,many thanks. Inspiring,breath taking, this movie should be the bible of everyone who thinks they had it,they can not take it any more,an example of believing in yourself and fighting for what you think is right and most dear to you.Watch this movie and it could change your life,you could start all over again with a new found strenght.Magnificent play bye both Russell Crowe and Paul Giamatti with the excellent contribution of Renee Zeelweger, both first actors should have been given the Oscars for best actor and best supporting actor."
"I just saw the movie tonight at a special advanced screening here in Newport Beach, and it is so good. I cannot tell you one single performance in the film that wasn't terrific. I can only think of a couple negatives. One being the man coughing behind me the WHOLE time. In terms of the movie, the section where the Braddocks suffer in the Depression went on pretty long, and the Braddock's kids were WAY too cute. A little shamelessly so. As in, no three kids are that well-behaved,loving and adorable ALL THE TIME. Great points: There were a lot more funny moments than i had expected, but none were cheap laughs, all were just honest and nice little moments. The acting and directing are just incredible. Renee Zellweger, Russel Crowe, Paul Giamatti (who practically steals the show), even Craig Bierko as the boxing nemesis were so great! Oscars FOR EVERYONE! It's too bad this isn't Oscar season-- i really hope this doesn't get forgotten by the time nominations come out."
Great movie. Crowe is in for another Oscar. Coming close on the heels of million dollar baby and surviving is massive. Comparisons would be obvious but it stands apart as one of the boxing great movies though at times moving but great performances by Crowe and Renee. The movie may not be a top contender for an Oscar but Crowe and Renee sure are. A lot of people have filled in a lot of details so I guess I won't go there. But I particularly like that scene when Braddock is to fight Max and they meet in the hotel and later Mae is shown cleaning the dishes. Very true depiction of the era. Money's worth by all means though some scenes are very graphic and could have been avoided but I guess Crowe (or his directors) like gore just as in gladiator. The fight with Max is very well shown like history being retold. Roles like this come once in a career and Renee has given a winning punch. Lets see if the Oscar pundits agree.
"Though Cinderella Man got great critical notices it did not do well at the box office which is a shame for those who missed a great sports story and Russell Crowe's performance as James J. Braddock.Between the time Gene Tunney retired in 1928 and Joe Louis ascended to boxing's heavyweight championship, there were a succession of champions who were not among the greatest, but who in and of themselves had some interesting stories. In order they were, Max Schmeling, Jack Sharkey, Primo Carnera, Max Baer and finally the working class champion James J. Braddock. Most of these guys fought each other and Joe Louis in fact on his way up the ladder fought and licked all of them except most notoriously Schmeling.Jim Braddock was a promising light heavyweight in the late twenties who got a title shot against champion Tommy Loughran and lost. As is the usual pattern of things, Braddock went gradually downhill and at the same time injured his right hand. This was the Great Depression and Braddock took work on the docks as a longshoreman to support his wife and family.Ron Howard did a fine job in recreating the era of Braddock and got a great performance out of Russell Crowe as the man. What Crowe gives you as Braddock is the real deal. Crowe nearly won an Oscar on the strength of a very touching scene with one of his children who he caught stealing a loaf of bread. Economics were bad, but Braddock's values stood the test.I suppose it was a matter of necessity, every heroic story has to have a villain and poor Max Baer's reputation suffers as a result of it. Craig Bierko is fine as Max Baer, but he did not give you the real Max at all. Baer was a savage puncher and in fact was responsible for the death of two men in the ring. Ron Howard shows him as a man with no regrets about that. In fact Baer was deeply affected by the deaths and held his punches on many occasions because of it.Baer was however a party animal who loved a good time above all. That was his undoing in his real career and in the film. Viewers will also like Paul Giamatti as Braddock's shrewd and loyal manager Joe Gould. Giamatti's performance might seem a caricature yet boxing manager were and are very much like Joe Gould, at least the best of them.As a personal story and a sports story Cinderella Man rates as one of the best films so far in this new millenia of our's. I wouldn't miss it when it's broadcast. Too bad that so many folks did miss it on the big screen."
"it's difficult for me to make a well-informed assessment of this biopic about James Braddock, because i wasn't there. i'm an ardent history buff though, and i know something about the ""dirty thirties"" from anecdotes and text books.this was beautifully crafted with it's sepia tones and shadowed images, the presence of radios and the poverty that was so much a part of the decade. what powered this film was the great performance by Russell Crowe. if indeed Mr Braddock had this kind of class, Russell brought it forward with his toned down, self-effacing yet proud countenance. and once again, Paul Giamatti was terrific as his manager. Paul is always great and i'd love to see him get acknowledgment for his body of work. Renee Zellweger was OK too, surprisingly credible with black hair. i didn't watch any of Max Baer's fights, and i know nothing about him other than he was world champion and his son was Jethro on the BH's. but i can understand why his family would take exception to his portrayal as a man who enjoyed womanizing, was disrespectful of women and basically everyone, and relished killing people in the ring. did he? was he? one thing i've noticed about Ron Howard is how he glosses over things. he's all Hollywood, and really who can blame him? he grew up in it's milieu. he's no Fernando Meirelles or Terrance Malick and he doesn't pretend to be. Mr Howard likes to entertain, and he's such an amiable fellow, hard to resist. all in all, this is a better-than-average boxing movie about a gracious, classy, humble man who loved his family and represented the little guy who could. Quite a Stretch for Russell. not in the same league as Raging Bull (what is?)nor Million Dollar Baby, about as good as Somebody Up There Likes Me, better than the Rockies and Ali. i'd recommend it, for the performances, and the look and feel of the thirties. even though i knew how it ended, i still found myself cheering."
"""Cinderella Man""  WOW! ""Cinderella Man"" cast  WOW! ""Cinderella Man"" script  WOW! WOW, WOW, WOW  what a movie! The new film ""Cinderella Man"" is the true story of boxer James J. (Jim) Braddock. This film is stunning and exciting from beginning to end. In my opinion, it's the best movie so far in 2005, and it may well be the second boxing movie in two years to win the Academy's nod for Best Picture. How can I say this? Well, Russell Crowe as Braddock has never been better. Incredible! Director Ron Howard also gets terrific performances from Renée Zellweger as Braddock's wife, Mae, and from talented actor Paul Giamatti as Joe Gould.What a lucky hit and maybe it was more than luck that reunited Academy Award-winning producer Brian Grazer, director Ron Howard, and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman (all Oscar winners for 2001's ""A Beautiful Mind"") with Oscar winner Russell Crowe. What a team and what a story! The film recreates the pain of the dark days of 1930s Depression in a way that will stir you to the core. Braddock, a once-promising heavyweight boxer, struggles along with wife Mae to survive and hold their family together. Braddock's impressive run of wins has been surpassed by a string of losses that has rendered him a ring has-been, grubbing for any kind of work. Then an unlikely stroke of good fortune  a last minute cancellation  offers Braddock one more night in the ring against a second-ranked world contender. Unbelievable  except it really happened  Braddock, with no training for the fight, wins that match. Everywhere in the country, this new hero  who is one of their own  uplifts the downtrodden people living through this terrible time. Those controlling the matches can't ignore Braddock's popularity and the potential for profit as the old man is brought back to fight young savages who will probably kill him. (Shades of ""Million Dollar Baby""!)You'll be on the edge of your seat for the whole play-out. If you're a boxing fan, you probably know what happens  but I won't spoil it for you if you don't know. Either way, don't miss this dream moviea true-life fairy tale. I'm giving ""Cinderella Man"" an ""A++"" on my Entertainment Report Card."
"Here's an interesting situation. Evil versus good, or if you prefer: a life of the purehearted versus that of the thuggish.Yes, its the story, but its also the form of the movie itself.The blunt, the stupid, the ugly is the movie itself. Howard and Grazier are so pedestrian it makes me cry. There isn't a shred of sophistication, elaboration or depth in this. Its one arc, unimpeded and unarticulated. Good man, Hard times, Comeback. The only slight elaboration is the worried-wife-as-watcher. Compare this to the richly woven ""Seabiscuit,"" essentially the same story but with all sorts of parallel threads and reflections.These two guys Howard and Grazier are the enemy of life with their industrial storytelling, their plywood narrative. It makes it all the worse that they have achieved a glossy style that looks competent, if you think manufactured cookies with artificial ingredients are competent. Zellweger is not a fine actress, so she goes with the manufactured sweep of the thing.The good which opposes it. Say what you will about Crowe's strutting, the man is an Australian actor and there's no escaping that. Even when told to be simple, and even in spite of his own imperfect and unformed soul, he just cannot avoid some depth, some parallel being  a reality under the cartoon. And also on the good side is the simple fact of boxing. Now boxing is brutal. And perhaps most people involved in it are simple. But they are real, and that's all the difference. And it is a real sport, perhaps the only real one. No complex rules and balls. No question of goals or finish lines, just a straightforward matter of the ability to give and take. Its genuine, and I'm sure that's why it was selected, to counter the cartoon limits of what the filmmaker could handle. And since Scorsece mapped the ring and Stallone in vented the slomo flying sweat, its been cinematic as well.So Its unintuitive that somethings that seem thuggish: Crowe and boxing, are the real things here, the pure and the good. And the bad, the evil, the thuggish; why they are our men behind the camera who make money from simplifying it for the goobs on the street. Who will win this fight, do you suppose?Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."
"Why use real stories if you are going to ""make it better"" with lies? Just makeup your own original story and leave history alone. Couldn't we have cheered on the underdog without defaming the character of his opponent? It is an unnecessary detraction from the storyline to make it so black and white, feeds unsuspecting readers a lie that a generation comes to believe as truth, and creates a great deal of sorrow and pain for those who knew and loved Max Baer. Like a Beautiful Mind the truth has been twisted to tell a good story. Read the real stories of Nash and Baer. Nash's life was far more interesting and complex, he paid many times for his disease and certainly did not sit around the house and the college all those years till he could get back his life. It was a process that was far more interesting, less beautiful, and more really like schizophrenia than Howard's production. People said ""He made me really know what it is like to be schizophrenic."" Ha ha. Read the real story if you REALLY want to know what it is like to be schizophrenic. And look at the truth about the evil ""Black Bart"" Baer before deciding about the man. Howard makes pretty pictures that paint lies as truth and sells it to millions to make money, not to tell a true story."
"Perhaps I had a bad day yesterday before I sat down to watch ""Cinderella Man"", but let me try to convince you why I did not really like this film a lot.I wanted to love this film. I tried to really get into the Depression-era feel and the ""feel-good-everyman"" riches-to-rags to riches story of Jimmy Braddock, the underdog-cum-heavyweight-champion who outlasted a younger, more deadly Max Baer in 1935. This film is perhaps is the most historically realistic and visually stunning film that Ron Howard has ever directed. It may also be the most ambitious film that Brian Grazer and Penny Marshall have ever been involved in, including Marshall's ""A League of Their Own""). ""Cinderella Man"" has every stylistic element in the book going for it. Production design, costuming, set design, general casting, art direction, and music was created by the likes of people who made ""Chicago"", ""A Beautiful Mind"" (which I call ""A Beautiful Lie"", and if I have time one day I will write about why I call it that)"",""Apollo 13"",""Do the Right Thing"", and countless other great movies. This film has more heavyweight talent backing it up than Mohammed Ali every carried into a boxing ring during the height of his career. This film has the painted-portrait ambiance of Depression Era New York City.What could possibly be wrong with ""Cinderella Man""?For me, the real problem is that I have seen this kind of movie too many times before. Remove Sylvester Stallone's self-effacing ""bad-side-of-the-tracks"" Italian untermensch and insert Russell Crowe with his well-practiced but overly-understated Jersey accent and you have ""Rocky I"". Replace Rene Zellweger's half-Betty-Boop, half-horrible-imitation-of-Cyndi-Lauper rendition of Braddock's wife, Mae with Talia Shire, and you have Rocky's wife Adrienne from that same film. Paul Giamatti, who plays Braddock's manager, must have imitated every bad 1930's and 1940's formula picture actor to smooth out the stilted and wisecracking dialog he is given in this film. Let's also just be frank. Brain Grazer was one of the people responsible for the remake of ""Psycho"" which should, by law, prevent him from ever making another film in his life, if justice were truly blind. This film, basically, was made by a group of recyclers. This film is the equivalent of an EPA ""Super Fund"" project for cinematographers.In short, just about everything in ""Cinderella Man"" is too perfect. It is the same thing we get from Ron Howard every time (with the possible exception of ""Apollo 13""). It's the same old substance-less sentimentality wrapped up in a lovely cinematic package that we got in Cocoon, Splash, Far and Away, Willow, and countless other Howard projects.The real imperfections come from the extended length of the film, the predictable dialog, and the severe over-emoting of Renee Zellweger's Mae Braddock character at the end of the film. I am almost certain Ron Howard studied ""Rocky II"" a little too long when he copied the feel of the Stallone sequel for the last portion of this film. I also honestly believe the casting crew could have hired Cyndi Lauper for a lot less and gotten a better performance from her than they got from Ms. Zellweger in this movie. At least Ms. Lauper came from the same neighborhood upon which this film was based. She could even have been made up to look younger. Ms. Lauper also wouldn't have had to fake the Jersey smirk that Ms. Zellweger had to practice for months prior to doing this film.I am also tired of seeing Clint Howard, who still looks too young for his age, in any movie, let alone trying to portray a character much older than his age. Perhaps, when Ron Howard dies and no one else will hire him to act, he can write that New York Times Best Seller ""I Was Opie's Brother"". Until then, we will have to continue to endure his presence. (If you want to see Clint Howard in something truly funny, watch ""Evilspeak"", which is perhaps one of the worst horror films ever made).The politically correct will also likely be angry at the casting and make-up job of Craig Bierko as Max Baer, as well as his portrayal as a violent villain. This will be the second film in which Russell Crowe has been cast either as a character with supposed anti-Semitic views (John Nash) or opposing someone who supported Jewish causes like Baer (even though ethnically questionable to some). I have read that the Star of David was minimized on Baer's trunks to minimize any racial or religious association with Baer's trumped-up villainy in this film. Baer was more clown than villain in real life and was horribly shaken up by the deaths in the ring that he caused. And let's not forget, he was Jethro Bodine's (Max Baer, Junior's) dad. He could only be so mean, if you catch my drift. In the final analysis, we get what we always get from Ron Howard. We get the feel of eating fine prime rib when in reality we are simply sucking on dry cardboard. He has built one more fantastic cacophony of sound and fury, signifying nothing.This will be a wonderful film to rent at home, but I would save my money and not see this one in the theater. It will no doubt do well and I am certain the DVD will go into production very shortly after the film's theater run and will also be successful.I just think there are better films out there somewhere worth dodging commuter traffic to see on the big screen."
"Wow, that was THE film I have been waiting for a long time! I love films of the Great Depression and also I am a big Russell Crowe fan indeed. Since Gladiator he has had no opportunity to show this side of his talent as a warm-hearted fighter. As J. Braddock, he delivers such a powerful performance through his stunning personality that made me cry in the end of the film! Renée Zellweger is a wonderful supporting actress as his wife, M. Braddock. Nevertheless, at the beginning of the film I doubted if they matched each other. Fortunately, after half an hour they grew together and their lovely, romantic relationship made me believe again in true love.This is the movie of the human will's victory, fulfilling promises, never giving up and caring of your family at any time. You will find all the qualities in the Braddock family which are on the brink of extinction these days.10 out of 10"
"In the North American Great Depression, the former successful boxer James Braddock (Russell Crowe) loses all his possessions and savings with the crash of the stock market. His beloved wife Mae Braddock (Renée Zellweger) and their three children survive to starvation and lack of heating and the daily difficulties supported by their love. In 1934, when Jim's couch and manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti) offers to him a chance to return to boxing, he becomes the symbol of hope of hopeless people in a ruined nation.""Cinderella Man"" is a very beautiful dramatization of a true story. The film has a magnificent reconstitution of a period; excellent cast, with Russell Crowe, the always excellent Renée Zellweger and Paul Giamatti; and a really very positive screenplay, showing the fight for surviving in an economic ruined country of a honored family with strong bonds and moral principles. The choreography of the fights is very well performed. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Luta Pela Esperança"" (""A Fight for Hope"")"
"Let's get one thing out of the way right off...this isn't a movie about boxing. This is a movie about family, about the real responsibilities of being a parent, about meeting those responsibilities. Yes, boxing is the canvas and it is presented with no romance or softness. But the focus of this film is Jim Braddock and his wife Mae and how they faced and triumphed as a family in the face of horrible challenges. It has heart, humor and horror of life on the edge. The acting is uniformly superb. Russell Crowe once again shows his mastery of the small moment, the subtle facial expressions, the power of the eyes. Rene Zellwegger rises to his challenge and puts in a surprisingly restrained and powerful performance as his partner in life. Their children are allowed to be children, not sassy Hollywood smart mouths. While many in the supporting roles shine, Paul Giamatti is brilliant as manager Joe Gould. He and Russell create a rapport the likes of Hope and Crosby. This is a movie for adults and those with adult sensibilities. If all you want is special effects, pass this by. If you want a thrilling piece of entertainment that will transport you to another time and place, if you want acting at its best, this is the movie for you."
"I felt manipulated from beginning to end. The director and scriptwriter obviously do not respect the intelligence of their audience to manipulate us with such over the top melodrama. One example of the type of manipulation I am talking about is the scene with Crowe and the son when they are having the conversation that they will never give up their kids....and the son starts crying. Is this really necessary? They are poor, its hard times for the family....WE GET IT!!!Do we need to be hit over the head with this??I felt that so many of the elements in this film have been done before and done better in such films as ""Rocky"" and ""Raging Bull"". The film never tried to be bold or original in its story telling.....it seemed just geared to please Oscar members...thats all. This film does not have the originality or complexity of other films released this year and SHOULD NOT be rewarded with any kind of nominations. If it does get noms...then Ron Howard will have succeeded in manipulating AMPAS. He didn't succeed in manipulating me and based on the mixed reviews and not entirely glowing reviews by most respectable critics.....he did not manipulate critics either."
"Defiantly it deserves more rating that it has. It has everything in it. Influence people to be good in society and try hard and have faith. Love about wife, she never lets go no matter what. Will the modern Wife/Husband stay together in these kinds of situations? In this Russel Crowe's perfect Acting makes Gladiator, Beautiful mind and others look bad.This is a simple but powerful and emotional movie. True story of Jim Braddock. A boxer who came big but lost on the way and survived the depression. Did things that no man will do to keep his family warm and did impossible performance that surprise everybody. Can say it's a miracle but it's his faith. Last matches he fought, he fought for his family, despite Max Baer killed a boxer similar style of Jim, he wanted his family to live a good life so he fought and fought he did. I watch this movie when I am feeling down and make me keep on going. You try too.I Love this movie."
"This movie is really charming and enjoyable. But it totally misrepresents Baer. Consider two facts: -Baer killed one guy, not two. He was haunted by this for the rest of his life and paid for his victim's children's education.-Baer, though a Catholic, wore a Star of David to show solidarity with the the Jews during his fight with Max Schmeling, who he beat much to the Nazi's annoyance.(for more, see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Baer ) I don't think it was necessary to wrongfully represent Baer to sell Braddock as a hero."
"Another boxing movie? Can nobody think of anything new? Obviously the Depression era is total news to today's Americans, but nary a hint in this picture that an economic depression is anything more than a force of nature, like the weather. Nor is there the slightest indication of any solution of the New Deal kind --- heaven forbid.Braddock and his wife are depicted as the ideal working class couple: devoted, devout and dutiful. Yep, it's ""family values"" territory. Wifey stays at home and takes in sewing (although we never see her sewing anything). Hubbie goes down and tries his luck as a navvy at the docks, when he can't get in a legal punch-up at Madison Square Gardens to earn some extra cash. It's enough to make the Bible belt go weak at the knees.When he is driven in desperation to take a welfare hand-out Braddock is depicted as profoundly humiliated and ashamed, and he actually turns up later with a wad of cash and pays it back --- as if his taxes and the human rights of his children did not merit the welfare payments. The conservative financiers of this picture (Ron Meyer/Universal and Miramax/Disney) would have lapped this up.I recommend to anyone fascinated by the climactic bout of this long, women-oriented flick to watch the video of the real thing that is included in the DVD package. They will see a sporting bout with no fireworks, and only a couple of sharp blows landed by either fighter. There's a clear winner on points and both fighters shake gloves at the end.In particular, they may be surprised to see in the genuine film the Baer character shown wearing a prominent Star of David on his trunks. Baer wore the star in honour of his Jewish father (although he was raised Catholic) when he fought Hitler's favourite boxer, Schmeling, and wore it thereafter. The star is unnoticeable in the movie's preposterously distorted version of the match, presumably because Baer was being built up as the big villain.In short the picture is a travesty, not only of the Depression era, but also of boxing history. Definitely avoidable."
"Now I know Russell Crowe may be a jerk in reality, but he clearly knows his stuff on screen so we can move past that. As a buff, bare-chested Gladiator-hero with a big ol' softie heart for his family, we love him in this film. It is set during the depression in the 1930s New York. The fact that he isn't fighting for glory but for for survival immediately makes his struggle much more poignant, and Ron Howard's Cinderella Man (2005) rides on this advantage throughout  this desperate depression time that drives a man to desperate measures.I think boxing is a truly inhumane sport. It shouldn't even qualify as a sport; it's two people inflicting maximum damage on each other. But Jim Bradock (that's Russell Crowe)'s fighting is something different  this isn't something he does for fun. In the beginning, after having lost a boxing match, a sponsor-person tells him ""Go home to your kids, Bradock"" to which Braddock replies, ""Go home? Go home with what?"" He needs to do it and it is apparent in the fighting.So in spite of my dislike for boxing, I have to credit this film for its dynamic, fast-paced and realistic games that even surpass those of Million Dollar Baby (2004). It's pretty damn exciting. Another plus for this film that elevates it above generic sports-movie formula is its setting. The murky, barren feel of the Depression invests the scenes in a kind of simplicity that is only ever present in Dogme 95. It places the environment in the backseat, with minimal visuals flair to detract, to make room for its realistic characters that consume the film. Ultimately, The Cinderella Man is a well-crafted and often entertaining film but it is extremely standard, safe, predictable, logical, been-there-done-that  there are no puzzling detours, twists, or unusual character developments. Sure, it is grounded as a reality-based biography but there is NO flair. Another director could have had more fun with the script. You've seen it all before, the build-up to that one final fight with the most ferocious and feared boxer, the wife's concern, not following the coach's instructions, the favouring crowd.Lastly, I have one more complaint: Cinderella Man could easily have been at least 40 minutes shorter. Not because it dawdled exactly, but by concentrating the key scenes into a shorter version, it would have been even more poignant.7/10"
"As boxing movies go, this one certainly can't compare to 2004's 'Million Dollar Baby' or the original 'Rocky'. However, Russell Crowe is convincing in the role of Jim Braddock, a man struggling to reach the top of his profession and while the underdog story has been done to death, audiences still love it because they always see themselves in their heroes' role. I liked the subject matter and the idea of the film a lot more than its execution, which admittedly, is flawed. Depression era people struggling to make something out of their lives. Crowe's children in the film represent my father's family and his siblings growing up. Something I've learned about in my life, and I'm glad there are those with big hearts like director Ron Howard, still brave enough to make these films in an era when no one seems to care about the impoverished anymore."
"Well the name of the movie didn't attract me at the beginning so i didn't see it. But today i wish i will see it on the big screen. I haven't been a fan of that violent deport. But this movie goes beyond that.. and Russel Crowe with everything (phone history etc..) was amazing.. great.. I was there.. How the desire and the love of their ones can make a regular man a hero for them. About the other boxer.. i actually don't think he was portrayed in a wrong way.. we seems a gentleman.. tough (of course he is boxer also) and famous. What we see is from the point of view of the main character of the story. And probably he wasn't laughing because he kill someone, but for sure what i see is the adrenaline going to top fighting to keep his championship. Or people expect him to knockout someone and been able to have lovely eyes. They are fighting not blessing the people.. So he was portrayed as he was a fighter. But anyway.. i love the movie.. totally impressed with his performance. I cant even feel i was on that time of the history.. but thanks good just for a while."
"It seems today anything done by the Crowe-Howard combo is going to get rave reviews. ""Cinderella Man"" is a pretty good movie, just not a magnificent one. The script is paint-by- numbers. Renée Zellweger was as best mediocre (she has the most embarrassing line in the movie: ""You're the champion of my heart, James J. Braddock!"") the rest of the acting was pretty good, but not as good as other past performances by Crowe and Giamatti.A terrible mistake in the movie was the demonization of champion Max Baer, who was as beloved as Braddock back in the day. As if the poverty and humiliation of Braddock wasn't enough to carry a story of redemption and second chances, they had to bring a villain. That's so Hollywood.Finally, there are two bigger problems with ""Cinderella Man"": The uplifting, true, sport story about people who win back a second chance from the Great Depression was seen years earlier in ""Seabiscuit"". The other problem is, despite being a true story, there was already a beloved boxer who came out of poverty and adversity to win our hearts. His name is Rocky. The real film version of this true story."
"The latest film from director Ron Howard follows the Depression-era boxing career of Jim Braddock (Russell Crowe), who retires after a number of defeats. Because he still has to support his wife (Renée Zellweger) and children, Braddock returns to boxing when he has a chance to fill-in for someone in a high profile match. His unexpected win over the #1 contender begins a series of victories that get the masses behind this true-life underdog.I love underdog movies. They're predictable and safe but still enjoyable and heartwarming. Cinderella Man is the perfect example of a good underdog story. It does feature a bunch of clichés but the film wins the viewer over by the end. I think Ron Howard is a very good director. He kept the film on a familiar path but he still kept it entertaining. He could have edited the movie though. It was overlong and the 140 minutes was not necessary at all. It didn't take away from the quality of the film too much though. Howard portrayed the good guy well, making him extremely likable. I didn't like the way the ""bad guy"" was portrayed though. In real life, Max Baer was a nice person but in Cinderella Man, he's portrayed as a cold and vile man. It was an unfair portrayal and Ron Howard shouldn't have gone over the top with it.The boxing scenes were exciting and well done. Howard captured the danger, fortitude and skill involved in boxing. The first half of the film was a little slow but still nicely done. The second half was faster and not as depressing. The ending was nicely done and very heartwarming. The film wasn't perfect though. The family scenes were too melodramatic. They all fell flat and the actors portraying the three kids weren't very good. There were also a few other cheesy moments that slowed the movie down. I blame screenwriter Akiva Goldsman for this. In my opinion, he's a weak writer and it amazes me that he was able to win an Oscar.The acting was great and pretty much everyone gave a good performance. Paul Giamatti gave a very engaging performance as Joe Gould. It was intense, realistic and he put a lot of soul into the role. Russell Crowe played Jim Braddock extremely well. His off screen behavior is questionable but he still delivers some nice performances. Renée Zellweger was just as good as Crowe and it's surprising that neither of them received nominations. After seeing Craig Bierko in Scary Movie 4, it was a little hard to take him seriously as Max Baer. He gave just an okay performance. In my opinion, Cinderella Man was a strong and heartwarming film but it wasn't anything amazing either. It was far from bland but it wasn't best picture worthy either. In the end, Cinderella Man is a fine film that's worth checking out. Rating 7/10"
"Heavyweight champ James J. Braddock looks back on his humble beginnings: in the Depression Era as a washed-up boxer with a broken hand and a revoked license, he struggles to take care of his wife and three kids before making a miraculous comeback. Director Ron Howard builds every scene as something extraordinary, while his throwaway bits (such as a married couple fighting in front of a church, or a man walking out on his wife) are hammered home with little subtlety. Howard constructs the film disappointingly, with a flashback segue intervening about seven minutes in, and with principal actors who look pained, perplexed or disinterested. Renée Zellweger, playing Braddock's fiercely devoted wife Mae (who sews under a single lamp while her kids always seem to be in bed), is stuck with lines like, ""When you get hit, I feel it, too"". This is the passive, loving wifey movie fans have seen since the beginning of time, and Zellweger does absolutely nothing original with the part; Russell Crowe has some strong scenes as Braddock, but our introduction to him, smugly collecting his money after a fight, is curiously sour. He and Zellweger have no screen chemistry whatsoever, and their dialects and acting styles clash. The smaller roles are filled with scenery-chewing overachievers, and Howard is shameless in allowing them to hold nothing back (everything is done 'colorfully', for effect, and the film plays like a ham sandwich). This true story comes hilariously ""pre-approved"" with a quote from Damon Runyan, with period detail that is careful but disappointing. The whole enterprise suffers from boxing fatigue. ** from ****"
"I'm not going to comment about the movie itself, i think it has been said enough, also the revenues, the critics' reviews and the number of people who went to see the movies in cinemas says all about the quality of this beautiful movie. I can't agree with those who complain about the fact that this film was ""over-emotional"". If the life of a man who got from working on the docks and not being able sometimes to provide food for his children to winning the heavyweight crown doesn't strike you as extraordinarily emotional, then you must be as sensitive as a kitchen knife. Come on, dudes, this was the only way to put Braddock's life on camera on a realistic way."
"I finally watched this movie in January 2009. I should have seen it before, it was terrific! Maybe I subconsciously avoided Russell Crowe films. That is an unfair assessment. And this film did a masterful job of showing hardships people went through during the Great Depression.Renee Zellweger is absolutely amazing in this as well. The relationship she has with Crowe is so believable.The story is great. I suppose some would compare it to Rocky, but this was a true story. I really recommend it.Ron Howard's direction is superb. Whenever I see his name as the director of a movie, I instantly know it is going to be good, like something Steven Spielberg does.Bottom line: SEE THIS MOVIE"
"first thought around midsection of the movie for me was how similar this was to rocky balboa. had that same kinda ""i'm too old for this s***"" feel, but this time, i couldn't help but feel more strongly for Jim because losing the fight would mean more than him just losing his pride. throughout the second half of the movie, there were constant references to the Max's 2 fatal victims, and u can't help but feel for Jim's life, and his family, more than u care about him winning (at least for me).i think the family emotions came on pretty strong, and both Renee and Crowe did a great job of putting it together. excellent acting on both their parts. somehow, it made a boxing movie less about the brutality than it was about the heart and spirit of the masses behind what the commoner perceived as a representative to their woes.i do agree with a previous poster though that it started out kinda slow, but i feel it was necessary in creating the kind of endearing family bonding that Jim, Mae and the 3 kids have. throughout the first half i was constantly asking myself: "" this guy's a boxer? well he ain't looking the part, but he's sure got a soul and a heart."" great movie, just made my day."
"Ron Howard's 'Cinderella Man' is the story of of Depression-era prize-fighter James J. Braddock (Russell Crowe) and his wife Mae Braddock (Renee Zellweger). Howard gives us a glimpse through the ups and downs of their lives. In the beginning we see the Braddocks as a happy family and then we see them during the depression era: James struggling to find work at the docks, his fighting with a broken hand, giving his daughter his breakfast meal, Mae watching her children get ill, she and the children stealing wood from the sign to provide warmthwe are provided with many such hard hitting scenes. We see James trying to keep his head high until despair wins over when he begs for money to get his children back. Through it all the family stick together and their love and devotion to one another keeps them strong. Then things take a turn for the better, when Gould (his former manager) comes up with an opportunity to box. Braddock is back in the ring and continues climbing the ladder to success. He does not let success corrupt him. The Braddocks remain aware of where they have come from. In a wonderful restaurant dinner scene, we see Mae slip some meat in her purse (to feed the children at home). Mae tries her best to be supportive but she fears for his life and her fears become more apparent when James agrees to fight Max Baer.Howard's direction is good, nothing outstanding. There are several memorable scenes (some of which I've already mentioned) most of which is because of the actors' performances.Credit goes to Crowe, Zellweger and Giamatti for turning this movie from good to great. Crowe fits his character like a glove and delivers one of his finest performances. His restraint makes his character human. His chemistry with Zellweger and with Giamatti stand out and make the scenes memorable. Zellweger is gold. Can this actress ever go wrong? Giamatti is outstanding. Check out his facial expression in various scenes especially the one where he requests McGill to take Braddock back. Bruce McGill is adequate and Paddy Considine does well (though his plot appears to deviate). Craig Bierko's Max Baer seems more like a typical one-dimensional villain, but then again, this is not his story.On the whole, this movie is more than worth a watch and one of my favorite 'boxing' movies. It's not just about winning but more about surviving. It's a wonderfully simple, moving and very human story even though it's predictable."
"You have to see this movie to believe that anything in life can be achieved. And this itself is the greatest achievement of this great movie. This is cinema at its best. The movie inspires you, motivates you and elates you. Russel Crowe, along with Edward Norton, is easily the actor of the generation. Its hard to believe that he did not get a nomination leave alone win the Oscar. But the real surprise was Rene Zewelleger. O boy! was she great in the movie!! When you have a tear in your eye, with a sweet smile on your face, you know you just had a beautiful moment. And this movie will do exactly that for you!! Go out and grab a ticket or DVD! Not to be missed"
"There is very little that a determined individual cannot do. Cinderella Man is a case in point. Thought of as an 'over-the-hill' boxer, the fanciful story of James Braddock (adroitly played by Russell Crowe) is a movie which should be seen by anyone who needs a second chance in life. Director Ron Howard has revealed once again that his talent for encouraging actors to perform at their peak is still evident. The film itself is occasionally enhanced by tragic emotional segments which tends to argument the action sequences, but not so much as to diminish the overall structure of the movie. All in all, Crowe and his co-stars, Renee Zellweger, Paul Giamatti and Craig Bierko offer a remarkable segment out of the famous boxer's life and creates a landmark of excitement and entertainment destine to please audiences for generations to come. A fun and compassionate film for those with heart. ***"
"Russell Crowe deserves best actor, and Paul Giamatti deserves best supporting actor in this true boxing comeback story.Ron Howard has become an excellent director.Although my parents described the Great Depression to me, this movie made me experience the poverty and despair as if I were living it. Out-of-work men desperate to feed their families, no jobs, no hope, and no money.Jim Braddock has to put his family on relief. As soon as he has enough money, Jim goes to the welfare office and pays back every cent. Incredible as this seems to us today, to Jim and his generation--it was the right thing to do.I haven't been so moved by a movie in a long time.10/10 but keep little kids away because of some gory fight scenes."
"This is a rich, poignant, full movie - full of real people, real life scenarios, real history, REALLY good performances and wonderful sets and camera work. I saw it yesterday afternoon and I am still affected by the sheer heart and soul of it. And, as Ron Howard can so magically do, I am still feeling a connection with the historical characters he brings to life on screen, such as in ""Apollo 13"" and ""A Beautiful Mind"". They linger in my mind as if I just spent a wonderful evening talking intimately with them over a few glasses of wine. Maybe it's because he deals with emotions in a direct and unsentimental fashion, and yet his respect for the human heart shines through. I dunno. I just know that I was deeply touched by this film from start to finish.Also, I am so pleased to finally see Russell Crowe playing a decent man (not a bully, a madman or a gladiator) in a major motion picture that mainstream America will see. Anyone who hasn't seen his delicate and convincing work in ""Proof"" and ""The Sum of Us"" (both Australian releases) still don't have a clue about this man's range and the depth of character he can somehow bring to his roles. Between his reputation as a bar brawler and the powerhouse characters he is famous for, not many Americans know this side of the man. The heart, decency and love inside of Jim Braddock comes through so convincingly that you ache for him ~ you can feel every punch, every indignity, every moment of despair as if he were sitting next to you. And yet, you CARE so darn much, you can't turn away.And Paul Giamatti (sp?) is incredible ~ funny, human, caring, cocky. This simply MUST be the year the Academy finally recognizes his work. His chemistry with Russell's character is very touching ~ even more so that with Renee Zellwegger (who does a credible job as the anxious wife.) This is a 'must see' because it will surely be talked about in the upcoming awards season. And see it on the big screen. The action is too good to miss."
"Never once through this rather long film did I find myself fidgeting - I was riveted. I have minor problems with the fact that Renee Zelwigger looked fabulous throughout, and, please, some of her lines...poor dear. I have minor problems with the fact that Braddock found his friend in Hooverville in the middle of the night in the middle of a riot - nothing about that scene worked for me. But who cares - the rest was stone brilliant. Paul Giometti should be a lock for best supporting actor - no way that performance is going to be forgotten come Oscar time. Russell Crowe was stellar. Great accent, totally ready for the role, conveyed a world of pain in the smallest ways. Totally believable. Fortunately I hadn't read anything about the film before seeing it, so the suspense was real and unrelenting. I was amazed to get home and discover I wasn't black and blue all over. What a movie."
"There are some movies which can be bought & kept in your DVD collection, this is one of them.Time & again directors have made movies to touch people's sentiments, but the life & misery of James J Braddock has been shown so elegantly in this movie that a tear is bound to roll down your cheeks.The glamor & muscle of boxing mixed with the sorrow & agony of the great depression is excellently portrayed. Each scene has been carefully laid out with the excellent delivery of Russel Crowe.I have seen many a boxing movies, but this one beats them all heads down.I recommend this movie to all age groups!!"
"Hi guys !! Wont go into much details about the plot or the technical stuff. See it for yourself. But one thing is for sure - this movie gave me a LIFE. It shows you that COURAGE and sheer DETERMINATION can take you anywhere. Some of the scenes just take your breath away and leave you really gasping. The boxing scenes are one of the best I've ever seen(yea guys I include Raging Bull in that). OK, agreed, this movie might not be factually/historically 100% correct. But, you know what, I give a DAMN !!!! This movie ROCKS. Russell Crowe ROCKS. Ron Howard ROCKS. Zellweger ROCKS. BRAVO BRADDOCK !!!!!!!10/10"
"I have heard so many people talk about how much they disliked Cinderella Man and how it shouldn't have such a high rating on IMDb. I, on the other hand, consider this nothing short of an amazing achievement in acting, storytelling, directing, as well as choreography. I wasn't the biggest fan of Russell Crowe UNTIL THIS FILM! His portrayal of Jim Braddock completely altered my perception of him as an actor. His performance is so heartfelt, so honorable, it really gets to you while you're watching the film that he (Jim Braddock) and all of the other people who lived in during Depression era USA, are much stronger and tougher than we are now. Just watching this film inspires me to become a more wholesome man like Jim Braddock. The fight choreography is incredible, every fight looks as if you're the one receiving the punches to the face. The story is told masterfully, with the perfect combination of family, personal anguish and triumph, and ultimately, the perfect unfolding of Jim's quest for the title. I have always respected Ron Howard as a director, but Cinderella Man is a cut above anything else he's done before, including A Beautiful Mind. This film ranks in my top 3 movies, and I keep hoping that it stays in the top 250."
"Let me start off by first saying this was a movie I had avoided seeing for a very long time. To be sure, I had heard many glowing reviews as well as some negative ones, but I'm not one to pay much attention to the opinions of movie critics; I would prefer to make up my own mind. As well, I'm not one to go for the ""heartwarming sports story"" type of film, as I find most of them to be unwatchable trash. So it was with much hesitation that I plucked this movie off the shelf and took it home for a look-see. This movie possesses it's own quiet, understated beauty expressed a multitude of ways. The old-fashioned sepia tones used throughout lend an air of authenticity, evoking the atmosphere of the dirty thirties and suggesting the despair of the time. The dialogue of the characters comes across as very true to life to this viewer. I'm not talking about the dialogue being true to patterns of speech typical of depression era New Jersey. Rather, the interplay between different characters comes across as very real, much like what actual people in this situation would say and do.Cinderella Man tells the story of James Braddock, a New Jersey boxer during the depression who, down on his luck, fights his way back into the ring after having his license revoked and finds himself scheduled to fight Max Baer, a man widely known as having killed two men in the ring. The daily struggle to survive waged by the Braddock family has taken it's toll on everyone, as it has with others in the neighborhood. James agrees to fight Baer out of financial desperation. There are many memorable scenes in this film. However, the one which stands out in my mind has to be the one where James, determined to get his children back after farming them out because of an inability to provide for them, goes to the boxing commission to ask for money to turn the hydro back on. If ever there were doubts in my mind about Russell Crowe's ability as an actor, they disappeared as I watched him portray a husband and father forced to pack his pride and do the only thing which could be done to dig his family out of the pit they were in. Heartbreaking isn't a word I would normally use when describing a movie, but it's the only one I can think of to describe his growing awareness that he will have to risk his health and safety to put food on the table.Renee Zellweger and Paul Giamatti provide support in their roles as Mae Braddock and Joe Gould, Braddock's manager, and both of them knock it out of the park, providing performances equal to Russell Crowe's.If you haven't yet, watch this movie."
"Cinderella man-when i first heard the name of the movie i thought to let it go as name sounds like a fairy tale. i thought it might be a romantic flick.so i never went down to see it for last 2 years it has been released.But just after watching it tonight,i couldn't stop myself to give the flick 10 o 10.its an excellent movie on James Braddock.Russell crowe one of the best in Hollywood and my favorite has proved his feat again both as Braddock as a fighter and Crowe as an actor.Renee Zellweger is looking beautiful as always.no one else could justify the role of Braddock's wife as she has. and more over Paul Giamatti as Joe Gould was at his best. I have never seen this actor coming out so crystal clear.All over the movie has been carved beautifully under the back drops of economic crises in America in early 1930's. Director Ron Howard has again proved that yes he has got ""A BEAUTIFUL MIND"".CHEERS TO THE WHOLE CREW OF THE MOVIE ROHIT"
"I love boxing movies! Forget ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Against The Ropes"", Cinderella Man takes the cake! Russell Crowe gives a powerhouse performance as Jim Braddock. A boxer who struggled to make ends meet to provide for his family during The Great Depression. He goes against a lot of boxers, including Max Baer, the famous boxer who's son went on to play Jethro from The Beverly Hillbillies. While he's struggling to get a job after injuring his hand, his family suffers from poverty, and has to go look for work. I recommend this movie for boxing fans, Russell Crowe fans, or fans of the sports genre. Too bad Cinderella Man only came in at #4 on the Top 5 Box Office. It should have won an Oscar. Russell Crowe should'V got the Oscar for his performance. Excellent movie!"
"This is easily the most underrated movie in film history. How could this have gotten snubbed so bad by the Academy? It's one of a few movies that literally sends chills down my spine when I watch it. It is a great story of what it means to be a good father, good husband, and most of all, a good person. It sends the viewer on an emotional roller coaster throughout the entire movie, and the suspense is at high levels throughout. You see Braddock at the both the highest of highs and the lowest of lows. Crowe is perfect for this role, as is Giomatti for his character. And of course, Renee Zellweger captures the heart of us all as she tries to keep her composure in order to raise her family amidst the terror of the Depression. This movie cannot be missed. It is easily in my top 5 of best movies ever. Enjoy."
"This is a story of a man, not just a boxer. We are never privy to all of the training and abuse Braddock must have been through. That's because we are as much a part of his family life and his dealings with the Depression as we are about the series of fights that he endured. He obviously was a great talent. The fact that he is held in such low esteem was a little surprising to me because he had not lost a fight. Granted, his injuries diminished his entertainment value and, as the film states, that's really what it was all about--tickets. But the real substance of the movie is Braddock and his family and the scenes where a man couldn't get work, even though he was able bodied and committed to the work. My parents told me that the word ""depression"" was more than an economic term at that time. Hope was taken away. The character represented as Braddock managed to maintain hopefulness and even had to debase himself to keep his family together. He was like millions of men and women. You could only do so much to hold it together.This is a film strong in cinematography. The fight sequences are very good. I don't know how anyone can step into a ring, knowing that another man is trying to knock your head off. The punches are seen landing. The endurance necessary to keep going for fifteen rounds had to be phenomenal. But the scenes of the depression are also beautiful framed. Not just the sadness but the joys people still create. The group birthday party when all the kids celebrated their birthdays on the same day was something I wasn't aware of. See this movie. It has charm and pain and action. It never sells out."
"Hollywood has shown it's true colors. By not even nominating the movie that should have been the best picture of the year, we can really see that it's all politics. This movie was so unbelievably good, the acting was more than first rate, everyone in it should have won academy awards! Watching this movie, you really see what it was like to live during the depression, but you see the determination of this boxer, and the love he and his family members had for each other. It's a real feel-good movie, whether you like boxing or not (and I never did before.) There isn't a moment in the movie where my attention wasn't held. I couldn't turn away for a second. It made me want to watch it again as soon as it was over! The only thing I didn't like is that it makes Max Baer out to be a monster, and I know from older people who actually lived through this time and followed his career, that he wasn't. But that was it, the only thing about the movie that wasn't good. It was absolutely the best, and I would recommend it to anyone."
"Hollywoods infatuation with the sport of boxing is easy explained : the rules are the sport are simple, its physical and yet can be like ballet and is always a good tool to depict determination.Ron Howards movie is just that...taking us from the golden glitter of the roaring 20s to the Great Depression, plus its a great comeback story, probably the best since the 1st Rocky movie. The fight scenes are intense and brutal - and quick! There are interesting additions including cool ""x-ray"" cut scenes where you can see the hits do inner damage. Plus, its a story with heart with a different type of ""boxing wife"" played by Renée Zellweger, Imagine : A BEAUTIFUL MIND meets ROCKY. Depite, really good reviews, it did really bad at the box-office. I heard the DVD is really great as well.Crowe once again shows his acting is worth an Oscar any day, and Ron Howard showers everything is the perfect light, creating a timepiece epic-sport classic."
"Yet another movie about the triumph of the spirit, filtered through the lens and overall vision of Ron Howard, and acted superbly by today's most masculine actor, Russell Crowe. This is the story of Jim ""Jimmy"" Braddock, and his rise from being down in the dumps during the Depression Era and becoming the biggest man in the world of boxing thanks to the solid support of his fierce manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti).If it weren't such a well-told story and did not have the presence of Crowe and Giamatti, this would probably by a color-by-numbers tale of redemption. Ron Howard knows an audience and establishes a quick relationship with Braddock. He is seen as a stern but loving husband and father, a man who at the start of the film has to step down from boxing due to a hand injury which made him unbankable for business. In seeing him work the docks and in one painful scene, beg for money, we feel for him and root for his eventual success (even when many of us who may have read his bio know he went on to bigger and better things). The thing is, this story has been done one too many times to garner a moving outcome, so when the decisive fight between Braddock and Max Baer (Craig Bierko) takes place, there's the predictability of emotions but no real suspense. Our hero is a very good actor playing a dead role.Even so, Cinderella MAN is a good film. Renee Zellweger brings in her own gutsy persona as Mae Braddock, which also benefits the film, but has little to do throughout. However, as a whole, there is less weight here than in A BEAUTIFUL MIND, and a little pigeon-holing in regards to the role of Max Baer -- seen mainly as a one-note baddie, again an old-trick of the hat to give the audience its Big Moment climactic villain (even when the real man was much different) -- but Crowe keeps on demonstrating just how powerful an actor he has become over the years of playing in American films."
"Ron Howard, the chronicler of the American Dream, the man who loves the happy endings with hurrays and violins strikes back with a new biopic (after ""A Beautiful Mind"", based on the life-story of John Nash), with a new story of long-suffering people who eventually get a well deserved reward. Well, who's the chosen one this time? It is Jim Braddock, a second rate boxer that won the Heavy Weights title in the years of the Great Depression. That way he became kind of a symbol for all the helpless people that were having a real bad time in those days.""Cinderella man"" have such a nice setting and an awesome production, the ones only the big Hollywood studios can provide. The boxing sequences are rather realistic (this is not ""Rocky"", the fighters don't punch in the nose each other 200 times by round), and the recreation of sweaty and filthy boxing world is superb (it will satisfy even the more fussy). Anyway, there's not much to say about boxing, there are hundreds of movies which talk about that sport.Russel Crowe plays Jim Braddock and he makes an awesome show of strength and charisma, he'll probably won the Oscar (that would be his second one, and his fifth nomination in 6 or 7 years). Renee Zelweeger plays the so loving and sympathetic wife of Braddock's. This woman looks like she's got rooted in Bridget Jones' character (please, no more pouting!!!), maybe with 30kg under. And last (but not least) we got Paul Giamatti, one of the actors of the moment. He plays Braddock's best friend and unselfish manager, and he plays it just brilliantly (he should win an Oscar as well).In short: a new Ronnie Howard's hit, a good film that belongs to a genre which has been so mistreated there in Tinseltown. It is not as good as ""Raging Bull"" or ""Fat city"", but it's surely worth watching.... oh, and God bless America! *My rate: 7.5/10"
"Once a young, promising boxer injury and back luck has seen Jim Braddock turn in one poor fight after another to the point where he is stripped of his boxing license and forced to looked for other work to support his wife and young children. This career change comes just as the country enters an economic depression and, like the rest of the country Jim and his family struggle to get by. Eventually he is forced to swallow his pride and start collecting welfare to get by. An injury to another fighter ahead of a big night gives Jim one last payday as his agent manages to talk the commission into letting him back due as nobody else will do it at short notice. Jim takes the fight for the money but knows that a win could start him back again  but he has no idea how important this fight is for more than just him.People on this site are praising this film and also wondering why it ""flopped"" (which is arguable but I'll let it stand) but to me it is perfectly understandable because the film is nothing wonderfully brilliant and is very much a package deal that perhaps people weren't in the mood for. I'm not sure if it is the presence of Crowe, Zellweger or what but here we are. What I mean by a ""package deal"" is that this is another one of those sports movies that follows the ""against all odds"" rise of the ""little fella"" when the rise takes on significant to the community/country. The obvious parallel is Seabiscuit and in a way Cinderella Man does the same thing in the same sort of way. So the sense of period is done really well through costumes and sets, the cast has big names, the big sporting events (in this case the fights) are done with a touch of slow-motion and, as the crowd rises, so does the music; whether you like it not, when they are done right they are very good at sweeping you up in the feelings.Cinderella Man is no exception and it does it all with a professional polish and grand sweep. The details of the story are different but essentially it is the same film and unlikely to be considered ""great"" on its own terms  because it doesn't really have any. That said, it is another good film in this mould and by the end, when the music came up at the end, of course I was into it. Crowe does well to hold back his usual arrogance to be quite a polite figurehead for the film and makes it easy for you to get behind his character even if you don't like him as a person. Zellweger doesn't quite manage the same feat though, and her pained look and trademark whine was quite annoying to me and I didn't like her performance. Giamatti embraces the trainer cliché and makes it work for him while support from Considine, McGill and others help round out a starry cast. Howard directs with a sturdy hand, doing well with the fight scenes in particular; it isn't all down to him but I did think he let the sweeping meaning of the final fight get away with him a little bit but to be honest by then I was swept up in it myself.Cinderella Man is nothing new or remarkable but it is still an easily enjoyable and warming sports movie in the mould of Seabiscuit and the like."
"Well at first I didn't really know nothing at all about the movie and just thought that it's a bum movie made with a small budget and terrible actors, an ordinary boxing movie with lousy storyline. Then I started to watch the movie, and about 25 minutes of watching, it caught me up in it real deep. The storyline is absolute brilliant, and if I'll see it again some other time, I'd get an even better picture of this very, very touching and glorious film. I might say, that this movie is the best movie I've ever seen. The actors are like a bulls eye, Russel Crowe makes one of his best roles in this film. Rénee Zellweger plays also her role very, very well. I haven't got any complaintments of this film, and in the final fight, Jim Braddock vs. Max Baer, I actually went in tears. That tells something about this movie, no other film has done that for me in 4 years now. And I'm, lets say, a ""tough"" guy, and still this movie made me cry. Brilliant actors & their acting! Brilliant storyline! Brilliant directing! Brilliant movie!"
"A middle-aged man with three kids at home and a wife he forever loved, struggling through tough financial conditions in a society that has played hard on him, becomes a mass hero after his miraculous rise to fame.Yes, I've heard and seen such stories numerous times before. I know how this hero keeps idealism even under extreme poverty, I know what words he speaks when he tells his wife it'll be okay, I've seen how he remembers what he's fighting for every time he's down, I've seen how his faithful and loving wife always provides him support, and I know how common people always casts him as their idol in the struggle through life.Yet, when I see ""Cinderella Man"", I shed a couple of tears at two places, I sit tight holding my breath each time Braddock receives a punch, and I clap after the last fight. The passionate work by Ron Howard and the haunting performance by Russell Crowe makes me almost one of the thousand 'ugly Jersey friends' that supported Braddock that night. You know what makes a film great? When you feel like you're a part of it."
"I must tell anyone who reads this review, that this movie is the first movie I have given a score of ""10"" since Schindler's List back in 1993. This movie had everything, from the amazing portrayals given by Russell Crowe, and Renee Zellweger, to the tremendous supporting role played by Paul Giamatti (Sideways). This picture had everything right on the money according to a very good friend of mine who grew up in the era this film depicted. The authenticity was simply as accurate as I could have ever imagined. This movie should win several Academy Awards, actor, actress, supporting actor, and director. Ron Howard hit the bullseye with this effort. Bravo, a job well done. With all of the garbage Hollywood has been producing, it was great to exit the theater feeling like it was actually worth the admission price for a change."
"From the very beginning of this lousy film with the quote by Damon Runyon stating that the story of Braddock is the best in boxing (oh, if I disagree and think maybe Ali's story is more important, I'm a dope?) to the ham fisted inelegant rendering of the final boxing match between Baer and Braddock, Cinderella Man is cheap sentimental hooey that is most definitely Ron Howards worst film and from the guy who made Far & Away and How the Grinch Stole Christmas, that's really saying something!The politics are specious and why does everyone else have to be a total villain in order to make Russell Crowe look like a nice guy? Is Crowe that much of an ogre? He's not when you look at his other work like Proof and The Sum Of Us. No, it's just a stupid manipulation on the part of low talents like Howard and Akiva Goldsman.From the PAST DUE notice on the milk bottle (oh, didn't they realize that if they didn't pay their milk bill they would stop delivering?) to the sick child, one cliché just trumps another.Did Braddock really return his relief money? Did he do it in such an ostentatious, look at me way? I hated this film. Truly hated it."
"I cannot believe that this movie is on the IMDb top 250. It is a bore. There are closeups and dizzy camera moves. It reaches in for tears from the first five minutes. It seems as though it were written for a couple of housewives before their husbands come home. Just horrible.Ron Howard, the poor guy wants to be Scorsese, Coppola, Spielberg, Kubrick... everything that he isn't. He wants to be Welles, Altman, Peckinpah... What I'm trying to say is that he wants so bad to be classic that he cannot settle for pretty good. And that, my friends, is what he is, pretty good at best. And he hasn't even been that for many years.A BEAUTIFUL MIND was overrated, but at least it was entertaining. This film was depressing. Yes, I know, it's about the depression, but it's so full of clichés my TV needed Pepto. Paul Giamati plays the manager, and swears for swearing sake, trying to be Joe Pesci in RAGING BULL, and so did the boxing/fight scenes, but it was just dull, dull, dull.Russel Crowe was boring. Renee what's her name was boring. None of the characters mattered. And Crowe's big claim to fame was that he beat up a guy who looked like a fat slob from Cheers for gods sakes.Ron Howard always shows us who is bad and who is good. Bad directors do this. Clint Eastwood, also overrated, does this. ""This character is bad, because he is a jerk, and this character is good, because he isn't"". This is what their movies tell us, as if we're children.But the fact that this film made the top 250, maybe we are children. Because anyone stupid enough to vote this as a classic should go back to kindergarten and finger paint with Opie Cuttingham.A horrible, horrible film."
"Knocks all the Rocky movies out in the 1st round! Being an amateur boxer at Notre Dame, this movie made me shadow box in the theater while Jim Braddock was throwing 1's and 2's. Even though I'm from Notre Dame, this movie makes me think Jim Braddock would have beat out Rudy for that spot on the football team. If you see one movie this summer, this one is THE ONE! Inspires those down on their luck, and really burns a fire in your heart cheering on Jimmy Braddock on his Cinderella journey.When Braddock's boy was desperate enough to steal some food for the family, Braddock set an example by making him return it, and by doing that he shows the future fighters and workers that you don't need cheap shots to be a champion.Nothing in this film needs to be changed. Everything from the acting to the soundtrack is simply outstanding. The audience is involved not only emotionally, but also physically. When a punch is landed on Braddock, the audience pulls back in pain with him."
"Ron Howard's films are so predictable. He tries to tug at your heart strings shamelessly no matter what it has to do with the story. This piece of trash is just another example. Russell Crowe should have retired after Gladiator because his career is over. Ron Howard should only make movies for LifeTime where all the half witted housewives sitting on their couches all day eating chocolate can truly enjoy his manipulative-no-story-but-who-cares-because-I-am-Ron-friggin-Howard. I am Opie DAMN IT! You had one, maybe two good movies Ron. Your creative tank is empty. Its time to hang it up and call it a day. My only regret is that I could not rate this picture lower than a ""1"". See you all at a better movie."
"like i said its not as good as people say it is, it really isn't that good at all it has no originality, its just like every other movie about courageous stories, people, etc., the acting is okay, but most definitely nothing special, or Oscar-worthy, everything else is flawed, and it really just doesn't have anything good about it, except that it has a good message, and costumes, and it is fairly realistic to that time period, but otherwise it shouldn't have such a high rating or be on the top 250, its all just overrated garbage, which is what Ron Howard has been making lately, I've seen one too many of his bad movies, and i just don't think ill go to any of his other movies anymore i guess i recommend this though, because it is an OK family-like movie"
