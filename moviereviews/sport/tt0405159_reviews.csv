"""Million Dollar Baby"" has great characters, but it doesn't glorify them. It has a wonderful story, but it never tries to impress you. The photography, score and direction is superb, but never distracting. What this movie is, if I have to call it something, is passion. Passion for film-making, passion for storytelling, passion for its characters, passion for its actors, and passion for its story and the means at which it will go to tell it. Amazing.Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) owns a messy boxing gym which is populated, mostly, by downbeat losers who he spends some time training. He runs it with his friend and former student Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris (Morgan Freeman), who now lives contently at a room in the gym. One day a young woman named Maggie (Hilary Swank) walks in, looking for a manager and trainer. Frankie shafts her immediately (""girly, tough ain't enough""). Frankie has bigger things on his hands. He's managing a fighter who has a shot at a title bout.But Frankie is old and weathered and not an appealing manager, so the fighter leaves him. Frankie is broken by this; it is another in a long line of rejections and separations. We can tell that, at this time in his life, he only gets really close with those he's training (Scrap is the only exception). We can tell that his loneliness  and a bit of persuasion from Scrap  cause him to agree to teach Maggie. Teach, that is the agreement, not manage. But, by the end of the film he will have devoted his life to her.So the rest of the story follows these two people. There is no real 'plot' that you could describe in a trailer because it is constantly changingit is not the inspiring underdog story you may think of it as. No, what it's 'about' is these characters, and how they react to the circumstances around them, which change with each scene.Narrating the story is Scrap, speaking like he's looking back to a time long ago when everything has passed. His voice seems flat, deadpan, but there is a working of subtle sorrow in it. Scrap is a sad human being, he sees himself as the result of missed opportunities in the past, and so he spends his time helping the others, offering them his wise advice, with a tone of deadpan humor and even cockiness. Scrap knows what should be done, and what will happen regardless, and he is sort of okay with everything, in a sort of passive way. But the man also knows what's right and he has a deep, inner strength which is displayed in one scene in particular where you just have to cheer. It is an intriguing character, and personally I think it's Freeman's best performance.And Eastwood's best too. He is an elderly man; some might say too elderly to still be working. After all, most people are retired by his age. But if you had to guess when you're watching this film, you would never, ever say the man is seventy-four. You would say something closer to the sixties, because the man has such amazing energy and dedication, and above all, he has talent. It's been forty long years since ""A Fist Full of Dollars"" and film has come a long way, and so has this man. At seventy-four, passed all those years as an action hero, nearing what's could be the end of his career, Eastwood has made his best movie. I really, really hope he has time to make many more.As for Swank, well, she must have found something big that she shared with her character, because this is not acting, it is existing. Swank is Maggie. That's all there is too it. This could be the movie she will be remembered for.So, ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a masterpiece. I saw it last night when it opened in my city, and everyone else was seeing ""White Noise"", and I was shaking my head. Everyone who is even remotely interested in movies should see this one, just so they can know how movies are supposed to be made. I'm trying to think, and there is not a single thing here where Eastwood went wrong. The acting, directing, writing, score, cinematographythey all accomplish precisely what they're supposed to with sublime perfection. Many of these aspects will certainly receive Oscars and all of them should.You may cry through this film, you may cheer. Whatever the case, you will love it.9/10."
"I don't know why, but I went into the theater thinking I was about to see a female Rocky Balboa kind of deal. I left the theater in a daze. Overwhelmed by the simple truth of its conclusion. My hat to Clint Eastwood. What an extraordinary career. An artist of enormous proportions so well camouflaged behind a shy smile and a charming, clumsy attitude. I remember focusing on Clint Eastwood through a very different lens after sitting through ""Pale Rider"" a mythological, lyrical western. Actors love him because he, clearly, doesn't lie to them, doesn't kiss their asses. He quite simply gives them room to maneuver. Even someone like Meryl Streep, felt freer and capable to stretch herself all the way to Italy under his wing. Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, Tim Robbins, Jude Law, Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman yes mostly men but there was also, other than Meryl Streep, Genevieve Boujold. Marcia Gay Harden, Laura Linney and now Hillary Swank with a performance that not even ""Boys don't Cry"" could predict. The film is a triumph in every department. My stomach ached from feeling. That's a compliment Mr. Eastwood. Thank you very much."
"Million Dollar Baby is a movie about boxing like Braveheart is a movie about men in kilts riding horses. What it is is a movie to experience if you find yourself ever entertaining thoughts about loyalty, determination, talent, no talent, age, youth, courage, fear, fate, and the pain and joy of both living and dying.I read reviews of Million Dollar Baby and expected to like it. Roger Ebert can be soft on movies because he is plainly a big fan, but even he does not lightly toss around the M-word, masterpiece. Yet he drops it on MDB, and justly so. The story is simple and searing. A gal (Hilary Swank) with much heart and no experience aspires to be the champion of the world. She is Rocky in a sports bra. A grizzled fight trainer-manager/gym owner (Clint Eastwood) reluctantly takes her on. His best pal and wise-man assistant (Morgan Freemna) stands alongside them, as the plot unwinds steadily, seamlessly, picking up speed, scene by scene, act after act. Eastwood and Freeman are artists at the top of their profession and they, along with the brilliant Swank, present you the very worthy lives of three people you will care about and remember. The arena is boxing, but it might as well have been boating or baking. It is a story about values and truths that far exceed sports and movies. I walked into the Lowes Lincoln Square theater last night knowing Million Dollar Baby was taking me on a ride and willing to hop aboard. What a beautiful, memorable ride it was."
"Flawlessly written, acted and directed, MILLION DOLLAR BABY is being hymned and wreathed by the critics as the best film of 2004. They're absolutely right. ""An old master's new masterpiece,"" the NEW YORK TIMES said in a review that was more of an open love letter to Eastwood than anything remotely resembling a critical analysis of the film itself. For once such honey-tongued critical adulation is fully merited. Dark, edgy, subtle and at times emotionally devastating, MILLION DOLLAR BABY represents the apotheosis of Eastwood's art - the most lucid and intelligently limned expression of his philosophy of the outsider, the noble loners whose personal codes of honour set them both above and apart from the compromised, corrupt societies they inhabit. The Boxing Ring As Metaphor For Life is a hoary trope almost as old as Hollywood itself, employed to varying effect in films as diverse as THE CHAMP, GOLDEN BOY, REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT, THE GREAT WHITE HOPE, FAT CITY, ROCKY and RAGING BULL. In MILLION DOLLAR BABY, though, Eastwood the director brings a fresh eye and an entirely fresh approach to both the setting and characterisations, virtually re-inventing this venerable sub-genre rather than simply recycling its conventions. Eastwood the actor is in fine form - a commanding if increasingly weather-beaten presence - as gym owner Frankie Dunn. A case study in loneliness, Dunn's creased face is a map of places you'd rather not go to and disappointment has clearly been a life-long companion. Co-stars Hilary Swank and the magnificent Morgan Freeman, playing Frankie's unlikely protegee Maggie Fitzgerald and friend ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris, give what are without question the best performances of their respective careers: deftly underplayed, their roles provide emotionally overwhelming impacts more powerful than anything glimpsed in the film's riotous fight sequences. Forming an iron triangle forged from mutual dependence, Dunn and Dupris school the impulsive but untutored Maggie in both the techniques of boxing and the tradecraft of survival in a world pre-disposed to pulverise individualism. The canvas-floored square ring becomes the arena in which all three characters confront their various demons, battling for both victory and personal redemption. Paul Haggis' screenplay is itself a masterwork, improving on its source material without betraying the concise but compelling situations and superbly drawn characters found in F.X. Toole's short stories. And, finally, Eastwood the composer's elegiac but unobtrusive score is a minor classic of its kind, a requiem to both lost souls and lost causes. MILLION DOLLAR BABY is not only the best film released in 2004 it is also the most fully realised and richly textured major studio movie of the decade."
"I didn't view this film until today because I simply wasn't interested in women in boxing; however, I wish I'd seen it years ago! Hillary Swank can never make another film and this one would be her crowning glory. It takes you on a wild ride of emotions from the beginning and Clint Eastwood's curmudgeon self is part of it all. Naturally, the ""voice of God"" in Morgan Freeman is there to explain it all and give some meaning to what each of the characters fell. By now, everyone knows the ending but I still won't spoil it for late-comers to the film like myself. I do believe much has been made about it and it's unnecessary. Yes, you will be torn about what is morally right but you can certainly understand how Eastwood's and Swank's characters feel! Please see this film. You will understand pugilism more than ever before and you just might see some of your own self in the film! It is well worth the time!"
"Clint Eastwood is a man of faith. He is an artist who is confident and experienced enough to have a deep faith in the audience that he is trying to reach. He is also a master of omission, of the left-out detail/line, trusting in his gut that his audience is willing to participate in his films by exercising their imaginations; that they never want any aspect of the story to be 'dumbed-down' for ready consumption. In fact, his trust in the audience to use their own minds to fill in gaps is like a gift of part ownership in the film. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a beautiful gift, and a masterpiece if film-making.Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn, an elder boxing coach, manager, and expert 'cut man' who runs a gym and is learning Gaelic on the side. He's a nice enough guy, but he can't seem to shake the guilt from ghosts in his past (some we're in on, some not quite). His guilt/shame is a constant just beneath the surface and gives him something of a cold exterior, sometimes frozen. Yet, as played by Eastwood, you know Dunn's aware of his own plight, but just doesn't know how to melt the ice. Or more importantly, if he's deserving of such a meltdown.Enter Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank). She's a thirty-something trailer trash woman from southwest Missouri. An unlikely hero for sure. But for my money, Maggie is this generation's Rocky. That may seem an easy, simplistic, and over-reaching comparison, but the parallels are deep, obvious and myriad. Like many people, Maggie's dream (being a professional boxer) is always just out of reach, yet she cannot give it up. She works as a waitress to make ends meet (or at least the ends are almost touching), but spends all her spare time training. Like Dunn, Maggie has her own ghosts haunting her, and through these ghosts they bond tighter than super glue. The heart and work (incalculably huge amounts) that Swank put into becoming Maggie are unnoticeable. It's a silly phrase but it's as if she was born to play this part. It fits like a glove. The real life parallel of her relationship to Eastwood no doubt played a part in her ability to connect with the character's relationship to Dunn. Yet this in no way diminishes her accomplishment. She is brilliant.Morgan Freeman plays Dunn's right-hand man (Scrape) at the gym, and reprises a role similar to Red from ""Shawshank Redemption"". He also voices the omniscient narration to the story, a la Red. Like Dunn and Maggie, he's similarly bruised, but somehow less deeply. He's there when both of them need support and helps to bring them together. I can think of nobody acting in film today who can embody kindness and wisdom through friendship and support better than Freeman. He also serves to bring in another Eastwood trademark – 'Banter'. Even when themes are heavy, Eastwood's sense of humor is never entirely absent and he and Freeman have a good time with each other, as did Bacon and Fishburne in ""Mystic River"". These three characters together create a beautiful and true, albeit small, family unit Eastwood's lifelong themes and 'blurring of lines' are on full display: good vs. evil, right vs. wrong, the role of violence, redemption, guilt/shame over previous acts, even god and death. Never one for easy answers, his version of the truth lies in the shadows, quite literally. Cinematographer Tom Stern crafts characters in shadow, shifting in and out of light. There is a grey area between the light and the dark where something approaching truth lies waiting, and this is where Eastwood takes us, then leaves us there to ponder. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a shadow play. As accomplished as ""Unforgiven"" and ""Mystic River"", yet even more personal, this film is a triumph of human storytelling. As Bacon's character says in ""Mystic River"", ""and the hits just keep on comin'."""
"""Million Dollar Baby"" is the story of three different characters Actually, two of them, Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) and Scrap Iron (Freeman) are pretty much mirror images of each otherFrankie owns a rundown Los Angeles gym where he trains up-and-comers His motto for his fighters is ""protect yourself at all times."" Scrap is an elderly ex-boxer who helps out around the gym and keeps Frankie company Frankie was the 'cut-man' in one of Scraps' fights that turned bad Frankie still feels he's partly to blame But 31 year old Maggie (Hilary Swank) is totally different She works as a waitress but aspires to be a boxer She is so poor that she has to pick leftover meat off her customers' plates just to have the energy to keep going Maggie needs boxing to make something of herself and gain respect When she first approaches Frankie, asking to be trained, he told her he never trains girls She continues to hang around and after much harassment he eventually changes his mind From there, we begin to feel some natural affinity between the twoTo say more would be to ruin a lovely, heartbreaking film carefully layered with surprisesBeneath ""Million Dollar Baby,"" there is a love story A deep love story between two people with scars in their lives... Both are haunted by family problems Maggie's family, led by her opportunistic mother is alternately cruel and exploitative Frankie has an unloving daughter he writes to constantly, but his letters always returned unopened, unread and intact We never know what came between themEastwood handles his role with such ease that it's hard to judge whether his acting or directing is the greater accomplishment He stands as a challenge to his conscience when he finds the correct answer in his heart"
"Saw ""Million Dollar Baby"" in Manhattan last night. Clint Eastwood, one of the all-time most famous actors -- and directors -- has more than enough money where he could choose to pull the strings on block-buster, mindless action pictures, ala Jerry Bruckheimer, or comic books. Or, hell, in his twilight years he could just lay back and enjoy his millions. But no. He has chosen instead to make quieter, lower-budget, heart-felt, character driven films like ""The Unforgiven"" ""True Crime"" ""Mystic River"" and now Million Dollar Baby. And the world is a better place for it. Eastwood uses his multiple talents to make films that have something valuable to say. In the emotionally powerful, Million Dollar Baby, he tells an allegorical tale of boxing to subtly express themes of hope, redemption, sacrifice, persistence, and belief in one's self. The movie emphasizes that failure is a more honorable and personally fulfilling trait than never having tried, while also frowning upon laziness and leeching off others. But see the movie and judge for yourself. I personally consider great films as the ones where I leave the theater with a better understanding of human nature, or a desire to improve the world by even a little bit. Eastwood's latest more than succeeds on those counts."
"Clint Eastwood is a legendary film personality. I am a great fan of his. As an actor, I had my reservations with him, but as a storyteller, I have truly inhaled him. 'Million Dollar Baby' is amongst his finest films, a superb film, that almost reaches a Landmark level!About a hardened trainer/manager works with a determined woman in her attempt to establish herself as a boxer. 'Million Dollar Baby' begins with some humor, then it improves itself into becoming a motivational punch, but ends as a dry and depressing saga. I adored almost everything about the film, except the final 20-25 minutes. The culmination is very depressing. In fact, one just doesn't imagine it would have to end this way! But in all fairness, this one is a winner! Eastwood's understanding to the subject is objective and that's biggest plus point. Tom Stern's Cinematography is splendid. Joel Cox's editing is razor-sharp.In the acting department, Hilary Swank delivers a Knock-out performance. She is the life of the show. Morgan Freeman is wonderfully restrained. Eastwood's performance, is a pure of example, of apt multi-tasking. Jay Baruchel as Danger, is flawless. Anthony Mackie is his usual self. Brian F. O'Byrne is passable.On the whole, the list of accolades this 2004 flick received is truly unprecedented. It's got a legendary tag. From this writer, Thumbs Up!"
"The movie is excellent. Hillary Swank deserves to receive the Oscar for her performance. I haven't seen much of her lately and am so glad that she was picked for this movie. She seems a natural for this role. Like she didn't even have to act, she just let her own emotions take charge. She stole every scene when she was on. Clint Eastwood is one heck of an actor and his directing of movies is even better. He is 75 years old and hope he has another 10 years of good movie making in him. Morgan Freeman is a great actor who never seems to receive the recognition he deserves. Tell others to see it because it isn't in the top 10 listing of viewed movies last week. I'm concerned the subject matter is too deep for most people and it will be pulled to make room for some lame-brain movie like Fat Albert."
"Million Dollar Baby, 25th feature directed by masterful storyteller Clint Eastwood, brings the art that is boxing and implants such raw emotion into it, not one person will leave the theatre with a dry eye.Million Dollar Baby tells the story of an old boxing trainer, Frankie, disowned by his daughter, left by his boxer, and has been attending mass almost daily for the past 23 years in the hopes of finding some sort of solitude from the sins he can't seem to forgive himself for. eastwood has never been a more finer actor, who's skills only seem to improve with age. Mr. Eastwood has for so long been honing his acting skills, he disappears into the role of Frankie, played with such remorse, such pain, the audience immediately sympathizes with him over the events that have happened in his life. once he meets Maggie, he tries so hard to not let her in, but due to her strong will to succeed, he gives in, grows and builds a relationship and a love that is so deep, he sees a light at the end of the tunnel, that maybe life is worth living after all. Mr. Eastwood took full control of his character, taking his acting to such depths that it's amazing to think of all the other aspects he put into this masterful film besides his extraordinary acting.Which brings up Hilary Swank, who in the past few years has experienced a bad run of scripts since Boys Don't Cry, again proves to Hollywood that when given the right material, she is absolutely stunning at becoming and knowing her character. Her face is so expressive the film very well could have been carried off of her facial expressions alone, she was so open to what she was feeling. Swank has cemented an Oscar nomination with this performance and quite possibly her second win as well. Just stunning...Which of course also leads to the wonderful Morgan Freeman. How this talented actor has not been recognized for his achievements by the Academy is astounding, as he again turns in a tremendous performance as Scrap, an old boxer Frankie feels responsible for for the loss of his eye. freeman plays the exposition or the narration in this film, and given to any other actor the performance would have been average. Yet Freeman has such a presence, such power on the screen, that he turns a semi-small part and makes it a standout.The score was poignant, thoughtful, and enduring. the screenplay was stunning, the words these characters said to each other, the story, the plot, the list goes on and on. Do not come into this film and expect not to be moved in any way. The film touches you, stays with you, and makes you think of the own decisions you have made in your life and how you've dealt with the consequences.Million Dollar Baby is hands down THE BEST film of 2004, bar non. See this extraordinary film while it's still in theatres, and prepare to be moved by it's emotional story about overcoming adversity, and fighting with all your heart for what you want in your life.HIGHLY Recommended.MJR"
"Wow- what an incredible movie! There are so many layers to this film, one could almost see it 4 times and get something new out of it every time. I loved first and foremost its message that we create ourselves through our drive, loyalty, ambition, dedication, and work. Secondly, I love its insistence in the good of the American Dream, and I loved its excitement and beautiful, touching message toward the end. A movie about violence and ambition that evolves into a movie about love, hard-earned sacrifice, and doing something meaningful with one's life. Grade A entertainment with a beautiful message to boot! Hilary Swank and Clint Eastwood should both win their second Oscars for their contribution to cinema."
"I've been infatuated with Clint Eastwood from the time I saw his first spaghetti western when I was a teenager. I've seen all the movies he's starred in and directed. And I've seen his skills as a storyteller develop, mature and grow. Throughout this period the infatuation remained constant and re-assuring. But today, after viewing 'Million Dollar Baby', I'm totally and completely in love with this man. Clint, his movie, Freeman and Swank deserve to win Oscars in every category for this film. He is a Master of his craft. I want him stick around and do it again and again!.And I'm in love Hilary too!. She does not act - she becomes!."
"If anyone had doubts about the genius of Clint Eastwood, they should run, not walk, to see ""Million Dollar Baby"", perhaps the best movie that came out of Hollywood is past year.Mr. Eastwood has that rare quality in choosing an odd story to bring to the screen. With this film he accomplishes what could be, perhaps, the best movie about boxing in history. In the first place, the story by F. X. Toole, in which the movie is based, is an odd choice. We have seen, so far, men boxers, but there is a world out there where women boxers compete in this sport that is not well known, or not commonly seen. The adaptation by Paul Haggis is excellent.""Million Dollar Baby"" has a rhythm of its own, seldom seen in boxing formula pictures. Thanks to Tom Stern almost black and white cinematography, this sordid world of second class gyms in the poor areas of the inner city, makes the film more interesting in its texture. Enhancing it all is the great musical score that Mr. Eastwood, a jazz enthusiast, has created. Music has always complimented Mr. Eastwood's work, but never in such a way as in this movie.If you haven't seen the film, please stop reading now.Frankie Dunn, is a man who has trained boxing champions. He is a man at odds with himself. He has demons within him that are tearing away at his soul. We watch him going to mass on a daily basis, but does that qualify him as a devout Catholic? Not according to Father Horvak, who sees a troubled soul in search of redemption.Frankie's letters comes back, returned from a daughter that wants nothing to do with him. Frankie, at the beginning of the film, loses the services of one his better boxers because a richer competitor is willing to pay the fighter much more. Frankie keeps the older Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris employed in the gym because he feels guilty in having let this former boxer down at the highest point of Scrap's career.Into this world comes Maggie Fitzgerald. She is a young woman who wants to make it as a fighter; she comes from a white trash background and everything is against her. The only reason she has been allowed in the all-male gym is because she has paid six months worth of membership. We watch Maggie as she struggles on her own without any help from Frankie, the man she would like to interest in coaching her. Frankie realizes there is potential in this young woman, who he sees on a daily basis practicing, and he relents. Maggie proves she follows his instructions well. Then we watch her progress as she wins fight after fight until the million dollar fight with the vicious title holder.The ironic twist toward the end of the movie arrives out of nowhere; it shakes us up because it was totally unexpected. It makes Frankie and Maggie become father and daughter. Because of the guilt he feels in his own life, Frankie does the right thing in accepting the responsibility of the situation.The ending is the only thing that feels a bit manipulative in the film, although it's handled with a lot of taste, as it would have been worse in the hands of another, less capable director. The only other complain is that Mr. Eastwood speaks in a whisper, which distracts from what is going on, as we strain our ears to catch every nuance of the brilliant dialog. Also, the voice over by Morgan Freeman's character is at times, unintelligible.This is a film totally dominated by Clint Eastwood. As an actor, he brings to the role total credibility as the tormented soul inside Frankie. Hilary Swank makes a brilliant Maggie, the ambitious girl that gets much more than what she bargained for. Ms. Swank has the best moment of her career after her work in ""Boys Don't Cry"". Working with the right elements, Ms. Swank is an actress that works with little gestures to achieve her input in the character she is playing.Morgan Freeman is excellent as the beaten Scrap, a man who ""could have been a contender"". He underplays this character with sensational results. Brian O'Byrne, a theater actor who has been seen in two important plays this year in the New York stages, makes an impression as Father Hovark, who seems to understand Frankie. Margo Martindale is convincing as Maggie's mother.Sometimes it takes a lot for a film to be good. All the right elements were gathered by Clint Eastwood for this movie. It makes one wonder what will his next project be, or if he can surpass the milestone he created with ""Million Dollar Baby""."
"It would be difficult to imagine a more perfect trio of performers the likes of Hilary Swank, Clint Eastwood, and Morgan Freeman in their respective roles in the emotionally-charged ""Million Dollar Baby."" My favorite scenes were the early sequences in which Maggie (Swank) visits the dowdy boxing gym and co-opts Eastwood's crusty boxing trainer Frankie into becoming her mentor. Along with the veteran, retired boxer Eddie, played by Freeman, the performances were as electric as the Ali shuffle.In the overall arc of the story of ""Million Dollar Baby,"" there were three extraneous subplots: (1) Frankie's visits to church and his talks with the priest; (2) the story of the mentally-challenged young man named Danger, who appears in the gym and is taunted by the boxers; and (3) Maggie's family members introduced in two scenes filled with such vulgarity that much of the film's hard-earned credibility was lost. Not only would the film have worked effectively without the subplots, it would have been a much better film without them.While Eastwood's direction was superb, much credit should also go to the designers, especially the stylish work with lighting. I cannot recall a film as dimly lit as this one, and the subdued lighting contributed substantially to the characters and mood evoked in this sensitive film. The three main performances were standouts. But this film was also a very successful team effort."
"Yesterday I finally saw the great Oscar winner of 2005, and I can say that ""Million Dollar Baby"" really deserves the awards of best film, director, lead actress and supporting actor, and even the prize of lead actor in the hands of Clint Eastwood would not be a mistake of the Academy: Ben Kinsley and Jamie Foxx were great, but in a whole I would have given the award to Clint Eastwood.The story is very simple and real: Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), a poor thirty-one years old waiter from the very lower classes and with a dysfunctional loser family, decides to make a difference through the box. She convinces the experienced hardened box trainer Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) to couch her and be her manager, with the support of his old partner Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris (Morgan Freeman), who sees her potential as a boxer. Frankie has a problem of relationship with his daughter, and practically adopts Maggie along her career, until she is seriously wounded in a fight for the championship and he has to take a decision.This unpleasant and sad theme, in the hands of another director, might have become corny. But the awesome Clint Eastwood deals with such touching story without final redemption, very realistic, making a future unforgettable classic in the genre. The characters and the dramatic situation are perfectly developed, and in the end, the viewer becomes sad, but never depressed. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Menina de Ouro"" (""Golden Girl"")"
"At the end of the movie, I cried what deep sorrow I felt, how true to life and moving with emotion this movie is. To be on top of the world to fall so hard, but to have the drive to complete the task, what ever that task may be. The boxing scenes are so real and full of excitement you can almost smell the blood and sweat. I felt like I was in the arena boxing with Hillary. MR Clint Eastwood; has a directing style that is cool and smooth easy going,brilliant. To see Morgan Freeman together with Clint Eastwood two great actors verbally sparring what a treat. Morgan can hold his own against a legend. Hilary Swank Is so believable as Maggie, I feel each blow. Hilary deserves an Oscar for her performance."
"Saw this last night in LA without much knowing what to expect. Hadn't read many reviews...only knew I liked the work of the three main stars. Swank carries the film and is at her absolute best. The last 45 minutes are some of the most powerful film-making I can remember. Eastwood is also in top form but allows Swank's performance to trump his own. Freeman is outstanding and might have done enough to earn a Best Supporting Actor nomination. This is so much more than a boxing movie, but it's right there with ""Raging Bull"" and ""Rocky"". I saw ""The Aviator"" two days ago and enjoyed ""MDB"" more.However, the film is not without fault...Eastwood has a tendency to allow scenes to go on too long and to fill them with too much dead air. The dialogue at times appears a little too ad-libbed. There are some minor logical inconsistencies. But the positives far outweigh the negatives."
"Three people carrying their own injuries and baggage meet and form an unlikely friendship that slowly becomes familial. Frankie is a man who has lived his entire life in the service of boxing but for reasons left unknown, has an estranged relationship with his daughter, so he has little else to do but be at the boxing gym and train. Eddie is one of his better boxers, a quiet man who can still throw a punch, and who lost an eye in an ill-fated match. Though these two men have a close-knit friendship Frankie still bears tremendous guilt over Eddie's loss. And now, a girl of all people -- Maggie -- wants Frankie to train her. She has nothing going for her, she knows it, and boxing is a way out. While at first Frankie sees no future for her -- she's 31 and has no experience -- he gives in and decides to train her to become the best female fighter ever... until tragedy arrives and gives their lives an unexpected left turn that will change them forever.What could have been a feminist's answer to ROCKY becomes something different, revelatory. Clint Eastwood, a film director that chooses to direct his films in a deliberate pace more akin to late-night jazz, takes F. X Toole's short story and re-shapes it into visual poetry that unfolds into a tight tapestry which by the end of the film will have stirred many emotions with nary a manipulative hand in sight. Clint Eastwood finds a quiet note with his performance as Frankie, the man who could have been a curmudgeon but becomes a surrogate father to Maggie. His final words to her, in Celtic, are whispered in such a fashion, yet convey an immense gravity. Maggie herself is a complicated character: her life is boxing, she has become to symbolize the sport, and in doing so she's achieved so much in a world where all she would have been is white trash. She has a family who thumbs their noses at her career yet want her money. However, she is not an aggressive woman. If anything, she is polite, humble, respectful even when she shouldn't be. Hilary Swank strikes every note in her own rendition of the character: a soft spoken fighter who is faced with a horrific turn of events and must relinquish her love of sports. Morgan Freeman's performance is also of note, mainly because much of it happens off-screen: his measured voice, the one who tells the story, evolves into one who brings much needed closure later on.I felt that the film spoke to me for most of its run. Maggie's story was especially compelling (even if a little predictable) but what resonated with me were the reactions of Eddie and Frankie who have less 'action' and more 'reflection'. This is a much better film than MYSTIC RIVER in the way that much of the focus is on the three leads' bonding as a quasi-family in a world that doesn't care about people like them. It takes its time, then captures your full attention, and before you know it, you are immersed in these three lives because these are people you could meet in your lifetime. And that makes a great film, especially when about the little people who are looking for that special place to live out their final years."
"Once again, Clint Eastwood did it. 'Million Dollar Baby' has proved to be an overwhelmingly powerful film. Because of this movie, Hilary Swank won her second Academy Award after winning an Oscar for her role in 'Boys Don't Cry' five years ago. Also, Morgan Freeman finally won the same award for Best Actor in a Supporting role, which is well-deserved. I cannot help mentioning Eastwood's previous work 'Unforgiven' and 'Mystic River'. I think he is a brilliant film director.Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank) is a 31-year-old waitress who aspires to become a professional boxer, despite her age. She finds Frankie Dunn (Eastwood), a boxing trainer with a fine reputation and who runs a boxing gym, hoping he will help her. But 'I don't train girls', says he.Notwithstanding the fact that he has turned Maggie down, she goes to the gym everyday to practise on her own, even though she doesn't know how to do it right at all. Her strong will somehow impresses Scrap (Freeman), an assistant and caretaker at the gym, a former boxer who loses an eye during a boxing fight. He starts to encourage Maggie and teaches her some basic things. Eventually, Frankie decides to train her, out of her amazing will power. Maggie trains intensively, because THIS is her dream, her only pursuit, she wants to get there, and in the end, she does get there...Within a couple of years, Maggie is ready for fights. She is indeed a natural, and it is owing to the fact that she works so very hard. Even though at times she has to confront tougher boxers, she makes it anyway. She never backs down. She becomes rich and famous, and she firmly believes her achievement would make her family proud. Now what she wants to do is to take good care of her family.But her nearly penniless mother despises her, because she thinks being a female boxer is simply ridiculous. She is 'ashamed' of Maggie, laughs at her, and her other family members are totally indifferent.By then Maggie and Frankie have developed a father-daughter relationship. As a matter of fact, the relationships between Maggie, Frankie and Scrap are quite intriguing. This picture portrays their interaction perfectly.'Millon Dollar Baby' strikes you when it's least expected. There are many points which leave you wonder: what price dreams? What do you live for? For basic survival or for reaching your goal, so you can be your true self? Are you willing to pay for it? No matter what? And what is LIFE about? If you had seen the film, you would understand what I'm talking about.Maggie has a family who takes her for granted, and Frankie has a daughter who never sees him, who always ignores his letters. In the end, all they've got is each other, but after all they have gone through, after all the respect Maggie gains (Scrap says 'Boxing is about respect. You win respect and take respect from the other guy) and Frankie's being so proud of her, they have to lose each other.This film makes people think. Deeply. This year's Academy Award Best Picture nominees are all good, I have seen all of them, but I would vote for 'Million Dollar Baby' without any hesitation."
"This film is one of Clint Eastwood's best films ever!!! The story is simple but draws you in and never let's go. The characters are simply too thrilling. Hillary Swank steals the show a bit with a sad and brutal story of a very tormented woman's life with incredible power. Enough to bring viewers to tears in fact. Morgan Freeman is great as a supporting actor and he definitely deserves some recognition for his performance. Clint Eastwood himself deserves an Oscar for his excellent directing and own spectacular performance. His role was perfect, creating a strong yet vulnerable character people will embrace. The climax will touch you as his character is given a choice that decides life and death. The score is moving in itself and I simply love this film."
"ADDITIONAL SPOILER WARNING Coincidentally, both of the best pictures in this year's Oscar are about choosing death against life, although the circumstances are markedly different. The mood is even more polarised. In Mar adentro, I've never seen a story about death that has so much life that while deeply moved, I left the cinema elated and thankful. With Million Dollar Baby, I cannot remember ever leaving a cinema feeling so depressed.Many describe the first half of the movie a ""Rocky"" type of uplifting story. Director Eastwood however is determined not to give people who are looking for usual Hollywood cheap thrills what they want. Resisting numerous opportunities to melodramatic magnifications, he tells the story in a simple old style and with minimalism. In addition, some detachment is gained through voice over narration of an observer (albeit not an entirely detached one) one-time great boxer and now janitor ""Scrap"" (Morgan Freeman). The final acceptance of late comer (over 30) Maggie Fitzgerald (Hillary Swank) by trainer Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) to pugilistic training does bring an emotional stir but even that tends towards underplaying. Then, except for one bout in which Maggie has her nose broken, all her victories are covered in such rapidity that can almost be mistaken for carelessness. But make no mistake about it. That is exactly the way it is intended to be, so as not to take the focus away from the characters, and their interaction.Scrap and Frankie is a pair that have been through a lot together, and have reached a point in their life when there's nothing that cannot be said between them. And it's not what is said, by the way they say it, that counts. The spark between Freeman and Eastwood provides some of the much-needed easy and humorous moods in this movie.Scrap plays a role that is almost like a guardian angel to Maggie. There is not a great deal of interaction between them but whenever there is, he is always gentle and understanding. Morgan and Swank light up the perpectually gloomy screen in this movie with the warmth they radiate.It is course on the interaction between Frankie and Maggie that this movie rests. Through the initial rejection, the gradual acceptance, the intense training and the eventual sharing of success, we see the development of a mentor/protégé relationship that is quite common, even when superbly acted. It's the abrupt and tragic turn of events in the middle that brings into focus the father/daughter relationship that has been fermenting all along. Not even descriptions such as ""heart-breaking"" can do justice to the emotional turmoil the audience experiences through the second half of the movie. The depth of the emotion intensifies as the agony portrayed by Eastwood and Swank towards the end pierce the air like a silent scream.While Million Dollar Baby is undoubtedly Oscar calibre in many respects, it is extremely depressing to watch. Final observation: here's a movie with absolutely no sex whatsoever (those who suggest otherwise may wish to consider consulting a psychiatrist), only one four-letter word (uttered, incidentally, by a priest), and a lot of guts in not trying to please the mass."
"I just got home from watching this movie, and it has left me thinking.I personally think the movie was wonderful. I've read reviews where people say that the euthanasia was unnecessary, etc. However, I feel that the euthanasia was extremely important to the film. Once Maggie could no longer fight, she had nothing else to live for. Her family was trash. She was happy, and wanted to die happy. I think it had a happy ending.I'm tired of movies that have perfect endings and the ending is exactly what you expect when you walk into the theater. This movie proves that happy endings can come in a variety of ways, just depending on how you look at it."
"*Spoilers Inside* (Please, don't read this review unless you've seen the film.) I saw Clint Eastwood's ""Million Dollar Baby"" after hearing glowing reviews from critics and friends. I heard that it spun a story you thought you knew into new and unexpected territories. I heard it was magnificent. I was ready to love it.I left the theater feeling cheated, not only because of the jarring twist that renders all before it null and void, but also because of the genuinely shoddy direction, screen writing, and cinematography. Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) is a white-trash waitress with the dream of making it as a boxer... Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) is the grizzled, crusty trainer who refuses to take her on as a client. Morgan Freeman is... Morgan Freeman, the noble, dignified black man that he plays in every film in which he's ever appeared. No surprises yet. After what feels like the longest first act in film history, Frankie finally agrees to come out of retirement and train Maggie. We are introduced to a harmless, semi-retarded boxer named 'Danger,' which was such heavy foreshadowing that I literally could not stop thinking about him for the rest of the film, positive he would prove to be the red herring that would kill, maim, or seriously injure one of our leads. The joke was on me- the character serves NO purpose in spite of his significant screen time. The idea that Maggie becomes an international superstar and contender for the championship and still does not know the meaning of the Gaelic nickname Clint has embroidered on her robe is absurd. And painful. When Maggie finally gets her title fight, an illegal punch by her monster-like opponent sends her to the mat, landing head-first on her corner stool- an event which in real life would disqualify her opponent and possibly concuss Maggie instead wins her opponent the fight and renders Maggie paralyzed, bedridden and ventilator-dependent for the rest of her miserable life. Are we having fun yet? This third act is where the movie falls entirely apart. Morgan Freeman's character is revealed as nothing more than a narrator, a prop, as he serves no point in character or story.Maggie's monstrously cruel family (ever notice how the antagonists in this ""brilliant character study"" seem to be pure evil?) abandon her and only Frankie will stay by her side, taking care of the once-strong girl who can now barely speak. When she does speak, she predictably begs Frankie to kill her, to end her life and put her out of her pain and misery. Frankie finally decides to oblige after the mandatory wrestling with his conscience... he slips in one night as quietly as the angel of death and wishes Maggie goodbye, finally telling her the true meaning of the nickname he gave her. First, there is no chance in hell she would not already know, and secondly, by this point in the film it's so obvious that Frankie loves the girl like a daughter that the point is moot. The scene could have been saved by Maggie warmly saying, ""I know,"" after Frankie tells her the meaning, but no... she's wide-eyed and surprised and moved beyond words. So Frankie offs the girl and slips away, never to be seen or heard from again. Wouldn't the nurses in the intensive care unit be alerted when a patient's vitals flat-line? Wouldn't there be a criminal investigation as to who killed this girl? A funeral, even? Not in Million Dollar Baby, baby. All we get is the god-like Freeman narrating the epilogue, pondering where Frankie is and what he might be doing. Problem is, I genuinely didn't care. What I did care about was the fact that the movie was filmed in GlaucomaVision... poorly-lit, out-of-focus, and often underexposed. (There's an art to shadows, Mr. Eastwood, and this isn't it) If you don't believe me about the visuals take a look at the scene in which Freeman and Eastwood watch Swank's first bout from the back of the arena... Morgan stands there with his arms crossed over his chest and there seems to be a key light on his little belly, drawing attention to his little bulge and making him look more heavy than he really is. There are a number of Steadicam shots in which the subject of the shot is lost, and boxing matches shot so shaky that people in the theater couldn't tell who was fighting. (At least it wasn't just me.) Million Dollar Baby is not only mis-titled, it's mis-made. The film exploits the boxing genre and a sack of sports-movie clichés in order to justify the idea of mercy killing. It is unsatisfying, incomplete, and poorly-produced. It manipulates the audience by using an absurd fictional story in order to prepare us for the ""shocking"" ending... a better movie would have been less black and white and allowed us to decide for ourselves. The movie is nothing more than a calculated stunt, and Clint should have retired after ""Mystic River."" It's better to go out on top... just ask Maggie Fitzgerald.GRADE: F"
"I find the praise that MILLION DOLLAR BABY has received from critics baffling. I did not feel that the film connected on an emotional level, and that it was more like watching stock characters in action. Hillary Swank is very good, but her character moves from amateur boxer to championship contender while showing practically nothing in between. Clint failed to impress me with his performance (and I am a Clint fan), and Morgan Freeman continues to be highly overrated. The second half drags considerably, and I felt the whole third act to be very manipulative. I know I'm in the minority, but I felt a dissenting opinion should be voiced."
"I can't understand all the praise this movie has been getting. I think it's a case of jumping on the bandwagon for many of the critics. It seems like nobody wants to say anything bad about it just because Clint Eastwood is the director and star.Where does this ""great relationship"" people talk about between the boxer and the trainer come from? I sure didn't see it developing during the movie. And what did Clint Eastwood do that merits a nomination for best actor? All he does is walk around, bear his teeth and growl. The only satisfying scene in the movie is when she refuses to sign the papers that would give her low-life family control of her finances and tells them to get lost. And then even that is negated by the ending which leaves her family getting all her money anyway. And what about the legal mess he leaves behind? After he kills her and disappears isn't there an investigation? And what happens with his gym?People keep saying this isn't a boxing movie and they're sure right about that. I don't think there's more than ten minutes of boxing in it. There are few training sequences of more than two minutes. She just goes from someone that doesn't know how to hit a speed bag to someone ready for a shot at the title. All we here is that ""it's almost like someone has been helping her"". I would like to have learned something about the women's boxing circuit but they don't tell us anything about that either. What was the purpose the whole sub-plot with the mentally challenged guy that keeps coming to the gym and getting laughed at by the other boxers? Was it just there to provide Morgan Freeman with his big scene of decking the bully?The critics all talk about how great Hilary Swank's performance is but there must be a dozen actresses in Hollywood that could have done it just as well or better. Also they don't mention that for the last third of the movie she is flat oh her back with a tube sticking out of her throat.Needless to say I will be hoping that by some miracle one of the other nominated movies will take the Oscar for best picture. I'm not holding my breath though, this is the same academy that picked Shakespeare In Love over Saving Private Ryan a few years ago."
"Please forgive the 'cute' subject line. Also, I never intend to throw in spoilers, but in evaluating the film with total honesty, it's sometimes necessary to do so. I also don't believe in plot summaries, as you can read hundreds of them elsewhere on this very site. In some ways, this evaluation reads best if you've already seen the movie. One or two more notes: I came into this film, as always, wanting to love it, and hoping to be transported, and at times it did take me for a good ride. Also, I happened to love Mystic River, the last directorial effort by Eastwood (Frankie),I could probably listen to Morgan Freeman (""Scrap"") do a voice-over of The Congressional Quarterly, and though I never saw Boys Don't Cry, I am convinced there is an earnestness and an inner beauty to Hilary Swank (Maggie) that impresses me. Okay, on to the evaluation:The good: Swank's performance as Maggie -- she did all she could with the role, although it wasn't the most interesting character, and she was ultimately let down by poorly drawn peripheral characters and a very mediocre script. Freeman is always good, and Eastwood's acting was pretty good. The look of the film was OK, the 3 leads looked their parts, the gym looked authentic, and it gave some insight to the job of the cutman. And, at times (but not often), the voiceovers added to the film. Also, some of the byplay between Frankie and Scrap was good stone-busting, yet it never elevated to great drama or great humor - just okayThe bad: The voiceovers too often told you what to think, or what was coming. They did not enrich the story, a la Shawshank, but often were patronizing, and seemed to be a device to cover for what the ""action"" could not do. All of the other characters - outside of the big 3 - were poorly drawn, and two-dimensional --all of them! For a movie that gave you pretty good boxing scenes and insight, it made no sense that Maggie didn't win the title on The Blue Bear's obvious disqualification. The backstory between Scrap and Frankie was not very interesting or textured. We never get enough, or really anything, about why Frankie's daughter never reads his letters. (That's not minimalism - that's just sloppiness. And, it's not like the film doesn't hit you over the head at other times.) Also, why does Maggie - the ultimate fighter in life and in the ring - suddenly do a ""180"" and want to die? There are so many shortcomings here: Why didn't the scenes with the priest really come alive, intellectually or emotionally? I don't mind that the movie switched tones, but aside from a touching moment or two between Maggie and Frankie, it had very little to say, and it didn't really explore the issues with any depth.The ugly: There was absolutely no subtlety to the depiction of Maggie's family (and they couldn't have been a minor force in shaping who she was) --just horrible, lazy, mean-spirited screen writing here. A little bit of the Danger character went a long way --was there any explanation as to why he was still doing his idiot act for months on end at the gym? Again, he was too stupid to be truly sympathetic, and too cartoonish to be anything less than pitiable. Not funny, not even dramatic - just ugly.When I watched this movie, I thought it was about an '8"" or a ""b"". Every time I reflect on it, I get angry at the bad script, the two dimensional characters and the wasted talent, and the inability to really involve us, other than wanting to see Maggie (the ultimate diamond in the rough) make it. So, at best, this movie, on reflection, was a ""D"" -- I say this with sadness, and the feeling that if I keep thinking about it, its grade will plummet further."
"I thought I was going to see THE movie of the year. Must have been a bad year.Aside from the factual inaccuracies of the portrayal of a quadriplegic woman, the stereotypical ""white trash"" family, the cartoonish boxing, and the ridiculous ""Danger"" character, it was OK.In the end, the movie proves to be a cheap political statement, and sends a terrible message in the process. I was paralyzed from the shoulders down at age 18. I'm not on a ventilator as Swank's character is, but I am totally dependent on others for feeding, dressing, etc.This movie just perpetuates the myth that sustaining such an injury leads to a meaningless life. Swank can choose between school and death, and she chooses death. Thank you for setting the disabled community back a few more years.What have I done differently? I've gone to college, lived on my own, and work as a respected journalist in the community. Where is the story about someone like me? Why does every disabled person in a movie have to be a punchline in a joke or depressed and angry? For the record, my feelings about the message don't have any bearing on my feelings about the quality of the film. It just wasn't that great.My opinion is the only reason it received such acclaim is a) Clint Eastwood, and b) it deals with a controversial subject. We know Hollywood loves to wax on political issues. If you watch this movie, please realize that the depiction of Swank as a quadriplegic is poorly researched. Hit me up if you want to know what it is really like."
"Made-for-the-Oscars cinema at it's finest. This movie is total rubbish. Other than the Oscar(s) it won, it is sure to be forgotten in the annals of film history. Just like Gladiator. And thank goodness for that! In classic Hollywood tradition, the film focuses on a chic subject and a chic controversy -- women's boxing and 'mercy' killing of the disabled. Unfortunately, the film has nothing to say about either.Since I am a former boxer and boxing connoisseur, and tend to be overly picky about such things, I won't go into the details of how they got the boxing aspects of the movie wrong. Suffice it to say that Rocky(I) was much more realistic.The actors in the film turn in commendable performances, but Swank is horribly miscast and Freeman somewhat less horribly so.Swank is far too beautiful, young, and fresh looking to play the part of a deeply scarred untouchable trailer park girl who no men are even interested in romantically. Total Hollywood bol1ocks. Only beautiful actresses need apply. Only the spoon fed masses can accept such nonsense. Freeman is always Driving Miss Daisy, and he is great playing that part, but he's far too benign a face for the pragmatically backstabbing ex-fighter in Million Dollar Baby. But he has a name...The plot of the film is horribly contrived. It was difficult not to laugh when the supposed 'heart breaking' ending of the movie revealed itself, unfolding like the nightmare scenario of a 15 year old pen trying desperately to shock his teachers and impress his peers. *yawn*For the most part, Million Dollar Baby was one big collection of clichés, and they weren't even combined in an interesting way. ""Girly, tough ain't enough."" Are we really expected to take lines like this seriously? Tack on the bit at the end about how life as a quadriplegic is not worth living, and you have yourself a real film's film. At least somebody thought so.If any proof was needed that Hollywood film-making is purely commodified and has completely lost it's moorings, Million Dollar Baby should suffice.Hollywood's 'Best Picture'? I'm not surprised."
"Most of the comments about this film on IMDb are extremely laudatory. And until the end of Ms. Swank's last match, this film does measure up to all the plaudits. The movie is serious in tone, but it also has innumerable funny moments, and it looks great. The film is truly magical until...... until the major twist leading to the end comes, and it comes out of nowhere. That's not automatically a bad thing, but in this case it is. The end isn't organic to what we've witnessed preceding it. My friend said it was manipulative, and I agree.There didn't seem to be any reason to take us where the beginning took us if we were headed where we ended up. What's the point in going so tragic for no real reason? Yes every acting job was flawless, I'm talking about the story here. It was so very odd where it went because there seemed no justification for it to do so. Happy endings are by no means a requirement for a film, but endings that are somehow the narrative extension of what got us there are, and this is far from that.It's really darn odd."
"Or at least it seems like genuine emotions in this masterpiece of a film which incidentally is Eastwood's best drama so far and considering how good Mystic River is that's saying something. The storytelling is both fluent and well paced and all actors involved deliver some of their best work so far which is mainly because Eastwood is so good at bringing out the best in his actors. I think people who have watched this film and Mystic River will agree. Eastwood is a no-nonsense story teller and cuts right through to the bone which means that there aren't many subplots and this is a really good thing in this film because the main story doesn't need a large number of subplots to steal away attention. Also at a running length of 2 hours the film would undoubtedly have been too long if Eastwood had added any more subplots.The acting is as mentioned earlier very, very good. Clint chose to appear in this film himself as he does in many of the films he directs but there is something different about him this time around. Eastwood isn't known as a director who pours his soul out on the screen but in this film he seems to add a few emotions to his range of acting. He is still a tough guy as can be heard from his voice but he is also just a vulnerable old man with an estranged daughter. Its hard to write about his performance without spoiling the film so I'll just say this: This is his most well rounded character to date in spite of the fact that it seems a little far fetched that Eastwood would want to learn Gaelic. Hilary Swank won an Oscar for her performance in this film and in my opinion it was well earned. She plays her character in a way so the character becomes almost instantly likable and you cannot help but root for her. This ability to draw the audience in and make them feel is very rare but Swank seems to have mastered it. Overall her performance is impressive. The last notable actor is of course Morgan Freeman who finally won his Oscar. He brings his usual authority and authenticity to the character and while he is ""only"" a supporting character in this film he definitely puts his signature on it with some very moving scenes. The rest of the cast is decent but as the emphasis is on the three mentioned above there is no reason to talk about them further.The script is rather simple but its simplicity is a quality mark. The film takes you in one direction only to take a twist and turn into something completely different and as the audience had just gotten used to the direction the film was going the twist seems like a genuine shock. I'm not telling what the twist is you're just going to have to watch the film and find out for yourself. The dialog is both witty and intelligent and above all it seems real. Believable. And because of the first class acting it feels even better. When I say that the dialog seems real in fact I mean the entire film seems real. Genuine. Everything from the acting to the atmosphere is highly believable and real even though Swank's character's family and the character of Danger lean ever so slightly towards caricature.The film really managed to draw me in and I felt with and for the characters of the film. The characters are the driving factor of the film and luckily the actors who portray them are skilled enough to make them seem real. Eastwood outdid himself in the drama genre with this film which is undoubtedly one of his best. It doesn't seem fair to compare the film to Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo (or The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) as they are very different films in terms of genre and target group.Million Dollar Baby is undoubtedly one of the best films of 2004 and is deserving of the Oscar it received in the Best Film category as well as the other Oscars it was awarded.9/10"
"Don't get me wrong, this movie is o.k. But it is completely overrated by professional and amateur movie reviewers alike. It is NOT the best film of the year, but it probably is in the top 10.No sense in giving away any spoilers or much of the plot. However, the prevalence of spoiler warnings should let you know that there is a surprise gimmick at the end of the movie. Nice try Clint, but I ain't buying.The acting is above-average, but by no means transcendent. Swank does well enough, and I'm not sure whether her unbelievable ""golly-gee Boss"" portrayal of the character comes from her or from the writer, but whomever is responsible should be cursed with bad gas (because that is what happened to me after consuming 1 1/2 hours of that sickly sweet garbage dialogue). Let's see Swank's poor white trash character travels 1500 miles to LA with no support, no money, no apparent skills, and was raised in a family of criminals, scoundrels, and welfare cheats. HOWEVER, we are supposed to believe she is some sort of saint, with a heart of gold, good morals and manners, hardworking and thrifty, and who talks like a house slave. Yeah, sure. If you had told me she was hooking or in the porn industry because she was down on her luck, fine. Bottom line, Swank's character has depth that is a mile wide and an inch deep. She says pithy fortune cookie type things, but we are never let in on how she reaches such sage realizations. Nice....but hooey.Clint's character is o.k., and he plays him with his regular steadiness. He plays a grouchy old man, but everyone knows that deep down he has a heart of gold and is grouchy because he cares TOO MUCH rather than too little. Clint's buddy relationship with the Morgan Freeman character is a bit false. They did the same buddy thing in Unforgiven, but this time they didn't spend enough time developing the relationship (at least from Clint's perspective).Morgan Freeman is great per usual, but really gets the shaft with this character. For anyone who's seen The Big Picture, you can just imagine how this movie was developed. They wanted Freeman in it, but didn't bother to give him a character worth playing. Cobble together all his popular roles as the wise and good natured black man (e.g. Shawshank, Seven, Driving Miss Daisy, Kiss the Girls, and Glory) and you get the same thing here. No surprises. The use of his voice as a narrator is pulled straight out of Shawshank, and despite the fact that his voice has a depth, quality, and familiarity second only, perhaps, to James Earl Jones, the narration doesn't work that well and primarily serves to let the director off the hook for actually showing us something (instead of merely telling us). It's too bad really.There are some minor characters, but they aren't relevant and do not advance the movie but rather serve merely as a pleasant distraction.Bottom line: a likable movie, but not a great one. If it gets any Oscars, it will be because of the hype and not the movie or the performances."
"Million Dollar Baby (MDB) is about, among other things, a female boxer's fight to get to The Fight, and then her desire to go out swinging. In a sports culture that spits out phrases like ""second place is the first loser,"" Maggie realized that no, she didn't lose: she just forgot to protect herself. Far from feeling sorry for herself, she marveled at the ride she had: traveling the world, being featured in magazines, hearing people chant her name (or at least that name that Frankie gave her). Wow. And when she faced her biggest test, and worst opponent, she stood her ground. Like a prisoner of war defying her captors, she regained her self-respect.Normally I'd conclude by saying, ""bravo Maggie."" Yet I'm hesitant. As noted, isn't it ironic that MDB came out at the same time as ""The Sea Inside,"" which shares a similar conclusion? Which makes me wonder, what would Christopher Reeve think of all this? He could have died as a B-list celebrity and the answer to a trivia question. Instead he faced his situation and kept going, and thereby found a new life even brighter than his first.A beautiful film, Mr. Eastwood. Yes, among other things, it's about boxing."
"900 years ago, the Britons invaded Ireland with the intent on eliminating the Irish race. Those who weren't enslaved were killed. Irish women were forcibly mated with Scottish men so that they would bear Scottish children; their descendants are the Protestants in Northern Ireland. I mention this to give an idea of how utterly insulting it is for a person named Maggie Fitzgerald to be ushered into an arena with bagpipes! But, hey, why do you expect her Gaelic-reading trainer to be up on Irish history when he doesn't even notice that her robe should read ""mo chuisle,"" not ""mo cuishle""?Why doesn't Frankie just visit his daughter, and ask her what the hell her problem is? Maggie gets a title shot, but no reporters show up at the gym, nor does she get a single piece of fan mail! Even before she gets to that point, Maggie should have gotten representation, and Frankie should have been dealing with promoters, but I guess Don King and Bob Arum don't do girl fights! Even those who don't follow boxing know that the stool is put out after the fighter reaches his corner! Frankie doesn't raise hell with the boxing commission after the fight! Maggie tells her family to shove it then dies without a Will, automatically leaving them her estate!But it was her ""If I'm too old for (boxing) then I got nothing"" that's the real hit below the belt! Go to college? Join the military? Find a rich old geezer? Forget Billie (and Frankie's ""sage advice"" to ""hit her in the tits""), that no options are presented to Maggie is proof that Eastwood has a serious problem with women! Why critics kiss Dirty Harry's ass, but refuse to call him on his misogyny is beyond me!The narration, chocked with stupid metaphors, is useless! And how is it that Scrap can dissect every characters' problem like he's Freud? Would he possess such startling insights if he were white? Doubt it. One more example of the shameless pandering toward minorities Hollywood passes off as progress. Million Dollar Baby is one big sucker punch!"
"Clint Eastwood has been directing films ever since the late 80's and has won twice for best picture. The first time was for Unforgiven, which I have to see someday. The second time was for Million dollar baby, which I just finished today. For a while, I thought that Mystic river was his best. But after seeing Million dollar baby, it's official. This is his crowning achievement.Eastwood in his long life has never acted or directed better. I have never been more moved,touched, or tragicly heartbroken by any movie other than Million dollar baby. Maybe My sister's keeper. No, Million dollar baby. I loved the characters so much in this film. Million dollar baby is easily the best boxing movie of all time. Better than Rocky,Raging bull, or any others.Eastwood plays Frank, a boxing trainer, who, as he says in the beginning,""Doesn't train girls"". After lots of persuasion by Maggie(played by 2 time Oscar winner Hillary Swank), he does train her. Maggie wants to be a boxer because she is incredibly broke. So broke, that at the restaurant that she works at, she picks up people's leftovers and eats them for her dinner.The film shows the solace between the two, and it also shows wannabe boxers(such as Jay Baruchel) and has been boxers, like Frank's friend(played by Morgan Freeman) and how gritty the boxing life is.This is such a moving story. All of the characters are so lovable. Lots of the scenes just want to make you stand up and cheer. The film is so sweet,and so touching,and so powerful,and so sad. But yet it's more than that. It's actually well writtenly funny, and extremely entertaining. It's sad to think that this is a true story.I loved all of the characters. Especially Frankie and Maggie. They are so sweet. Eastwood deserved the Oscar that night. He deserved the win, along with Freeman and Swank. Those are three great actors, starring in one great movie. I, like the rest of the world, loved Million dollar baby.A+"
"As a boxing film it is most certainly immersive in the sense that Clint Eastwood brings the audience into the story and uses them as an emotional punching-bag. Before going into this film it must be stressed that the film is not light even for a boxing film. At the end of the film there is no real hope left as we see the consequences of the events preceding. I am not a boxing fan and believe it to be a stupid sport where death lurks in every dark corner and whether Clint Eastwood is a boxing fan or not he deals with my problems with boxing in an intelligent and moving way which express the consequences of what can come from the sport. The direction from Eastwood is quiet and beautiful, something I greatly admire him for that is on perfect showcase here and in other films such as Letters from Iwo Jima and Gran Torino. There is a simplicity to this film which is both moving and harrowing. The acting is brilliant. Hilary Swank's ferocious intensity is perfect and she is the first character we connect to. She's an outsider coming into the realm of boxing just as the audience is an outside coming into the film. The film's narrator and supporting actor Morgan Freeman turns in another wonderful performance which isn't showy but is real and whole and Eastwood leads the ensemble in-front of the camera in one of his finest performances ever captured. His music is also beautiful as it too captures the simplicity of the story. At the end I just feel sorry for Cinderella Man, Ron Howard is probably thinking 'why did I have to release my boxing movie the same year the best one ever made was?'"
"I watched this awesome movie last night on TV, and I could not stop crying for half an hour: its greatness and emotional power are really something rare and precious. It is simply incredible how the genius of Clint Eatwood was able to go beyond the physical violence of a boxing story and make it an astonishing metaphor of life. The mysterious and simple truth about life and death are so plainly but deeply concentrated in two hours. Respecting and protecting yourself, distinguishing between the moment you have to fight and the one you have to wait, searching for the great shot of a lifetime, always recognizing one's limits, suffering till the utmost to prove one's strength, standing up after being knocked down but accepting defeat as part of life, enjoying success, but realizing that fair play is not always rewarded, and in the end, feeling when the game is over, for good: this both boxing and life teach. Also faith, however fragile and doubtful, plays a significant role, Frankie goes to mass every day to expiate some guilt of his past life, he needs to believe in something beyond man, although not being fully convinced and although there comes a time in everyone's life when you are alone with your conscience and no one but yourself can make the right decision (the priest, too, knows that religious teachings do not always go hand in hand with the troubles of life). As the movie approached the end I seemed not to be able to stand the strong emotional engagement, I felt like changing the channel, but I did not, obviously, since it is a movie you have to feel until the utmost. Clint Eastwood is the prototype of true humanity, there are no sufficient words to express his greatness, and his pairing with the always impeccable Morgan Freeman make the story reach the deepest chords of the human soul. Hilary Swank proves to be a talented and courageous actress, in that she let herself be deprived of her natural beauty and femininity to convey the bare truth of life. It is a must see movie, one of those which make you think, cry, feel and cry again in an extreme way, a milestone in the history of cinema."
"Million Dollar Baby is a great, moving story. This is a movie that sort of deserved the Best Picture award. Nearly all the actors did a fantastic job especially Clint Eastwood.Clint Eastwood stars as a grumpy boxing trainer. He trained some of the best over his long career. Then he meets a poor girl with ambition of winning boxing fights. But, Frankie is reluctant to train the girl, Maggie. He eventually gives in and things happen that are destined to change lives.As I said before, the acting is superb. Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and Hilary Swank all gave great performances.The story is a moving one. You do not have to be into sports to see and understand the intense drama. You should expect to have a few tears during this film.Overall, Clint Eastwood did a great job. He had a wonderful career acting and directing films. I rate this film 9/10."
"This has to be a 10. This movie never loses it's impact, emotion, or ""wow"" factor every time I see it. I almost can't say a bad thing about it. As for story and content, I'd probably give it a 9, but the powerhouse trio of Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and Hillary Swank push it to a 10. For one thing, I seem to enjoy movies that are narrated by one of the major characters, and Morgan does a fantastic job at this. It was just the right level of emotion to carry through the film. The boxing scenes were awesome!!! Clint Eastwood pulled off the perfect combination of hardened trainer and loving father. It was almost as if he had Maggie replace his daughter who would not talk to him. However, I must say that this is especially fitting for a boxing movie, two people need to be punched in the face. The first, and the most deserving of a punch in the face is Maggie's mother. She is a disgusting, lazy, selfish loser who wants to just sit and take handouts, living off the government while illegally accepting money and gifts from other people. Then she has the balls to hire a lawyer to try to take Maggie's money under the guise of ""protecting her assets."" Bullcrap! Also, to top it all off, when Maggie's family comes out to see her, they spend the day at Disneyland first! Some winning family she has. I almost cheered when Maggie told them all where to shove it. I really enjoy seeing stupid people like that get what they deserve. The second person that needs a punch in the face is the Blue Bear. The cheap shot she took cost Maggie her mobility and career, and eventually her life. We do not hear later what happens to the Blue Bear, but hopefully she was severely punished and banned from boxing. Somehow, I don't think so because she already had a reputation for fighting dirty and getting away with it, but I think I saw a hint of remorse on her face she she saw Maggie's neck break. All in all, amazing film, great music, story, characters, acting, awesome! See my profile to understand my rating philosophy."
"I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life. It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank. Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby."
"There is both much to admire, and to despise, within this film. I believe the positives far outweigh the negatives, yet the negatives are so odious, so blatant, that they amount to a major defacement--all the more so because they could have so easily been corrected--marring what otherwise might have been a masterpiece of film making. As a drama about two lonely people who find each other and fall in love (though not in a romantic sense), this film is in a class few others share. As a drama about the sport of boxing, it veers wildly between insightful and ridiculous, and the film as a whole too often embraces caricature and melodrama, crippling our suspension of disbelief and leaving it floundering.The film revolves about Maggie Fitzgerald--a 30 year old woman who attempts to escape a difficult upbringing in a single-minded pursuit of a boxing career--and Frankie Dunn, a down-on-his-luck manager/trainer and owner of a rundown boxing gym. She basically takes up residence in his gym, working out and trying to persuade him to take her under his wing. He wants no part of managing a ""girl""--especially one virtually over the hill--and puts her off with one caustic rebuff after another. She persists, and over time, stubbornly refusing to take no for an answer, finally persuades him to train her. Before long, reluctantly, a bond begins to grow between the crusty old trainer, permanently estranged from his only daughter, and this fiercely determined woman whose father, the only person who ever loved her, died long ago. It is this growing relationship that is the heart of the film, and it is magnificently played out between these fine actors. Hilary Swank is mesmerizing, every gesture, every expression is convincing. The fact that her character is so sweet-natured, so adorable (in an early fight, she shrugs her shoulders to Frankie's mock disgust in such a way that it had to have melted the hearts of anyone with a heart) that it might give us pause later after the lights go on when we might ask, ""How could this immensely genial character have been so alone?"" but Swank is so compelling that as we watch her, we never doubt her or her situation for a moment. Clint Eastwood is almost as good, and his brusque, brooding, deeply wounded old gym-rat provides an excellent foil to Swank's more hopeful character. We become ensnared in their emotional dynamics, much more than their pursuit of a boxing title. As we watch their love for each other grow (the love between surrogate father and daughter), our love for each of their characters grows as well, so that the ultimate tragedy that befalls them is almost unbearable to watch.Or at least, it would be if you can ignore the intruding absurdities. First among them are some of the fight sequences. Most of these play well, though there are occasional moments when a punch clearly lands upon air, half a meter from the opponent's face, and yet we hear an accompanying sound effect as if there had been a solidly landed blow. But the principle problem concerns the fights involving a character called ""The Blue Bear""--a figure so ludicrous her appearance in a comic book would be jarringly idiotic. We see her perform acts of deranged mayhem in the ring that make the biting off of an ear seem pacifist. A Nazi Storm Trooper would find her embarrassing. Anyone displaying these traits in real life would be barred from prize-fighting years before reaching a title fight. To suggest that such a one could become champion is light years beyond far-fetched. Apparently, every one of her referees, and the two judges at court-side, are carefully selected for their inability to open their eyes. {Brief Spoilers Ahead} In the climatic showdown, we are told the ""Bear"" wins in spite of egregious violations, including the knock-out punch which occurs 10 seconds after the bell has sounded. {Spoilers End} I thought ""Cinderella Man's"" depiction of the fighter Max Baer was a bit over the top--but not compared to this. In a hundred other boxing films I have seen nothing to approach the outlandishness of this depiction.There were other problems. Maggie's surviving family were overwrought, cardboard caricatures. Morgan Freeman, who plays Frankie's closest friend, provides the film's narration, and though he does his usual excellent job, his comments weren't as finely written (or were perhaps over written) as those he voiced in ""Shawshank Redemption."" Two or three times we hear him talk about being ""somewhere between nowhere and good-bye,"" which was two or three times too many.In spite of the drawbacks, which are far from incidental, I found myself spellbound by Maggie and Frankie's relationship. There are other nice things about the film, not least of which is a crowd-pleasing ""interchange"" between Freeman and a bully/would-be fighter, and Eastwood's direction which, in spite of contributing to the lapses noted above, does a fabulous job of getting the most from his cast and providing a wonderfully paced movie--but it is the strength of the central relationship which buoys the film, keeping it afloat in the midst of its sea of weakness. I cannot help but mourn the loss of what could have been. A more realistic villain, a fine-tuning of the script, and this might have been both the greatest boxing movie of all time, and one of the great love stories. I'd like to shake Haggis (the writer) and Eastwood for failing to fully capitalize on their opportunity."
"Of course, I must see ""THE BEST PICTURE OF 2004!"", I think every movie fanatic has too. Man, cry me a river, this was a good movie! I have to admit, I had my doubts. I'm not really into boxing movies, exception: Raging Bull. But so many people told me that this was a great movie and it was. Hilary Swank, what a performance! This movie makes you feel as if anything can happen. ""I got what I needed"" she says to Clint Eastwood. Clint and Hilary together were absolutely perfect. They made a great team. Clint really did a great job expressing his doubts at first but believing in Hilary, it was truly inspirational.Morgan Freeman is a remarkable actor. I'M SO HAPPY HE WON FINALLY! Even though I feel sometimes his roles are typical, he's the disrespected man, but has knowledge and helps people, he's really good at it.I really enjoyed this movie, but just to let you know, it is a tear jerker. So you might want to have a box of Kleenex next to you. This is a wonderful film that everyone should watch. You'll feel better after you watch it, I know that sounds silly, but I'm sure that everyone else who watched it will agree with me.10/10"
"What in the world was the Academy thinking?!! Eastwood's movies get slower and slower, more and more tedious as he ages. At least in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil the tedious pace worked with the storyline. If possible, this was even a worse movie than the over-hyped Mystic River that took a great book and turned it into a chore of a movie to watch.And Hilary Swank? All you have to do to win an Oscar is put some mashed taters in yer mouth and try to speak and you're a great actress? Shoulda been any of the other nominees but her.Moving on to Morgan Freeman... Another walk on in a long string of walk ons. For a man with such obvious talent, where's the beef? Moving on to Eastwood himself... You've already heard my opinion on his directing style and now the acting (and I use the term loosely). Clint adds this to a long and still growing list of broken heroes,has beens and other sad sack ""strong and silent"" types. I personally think he needs to retire from both sides of the camera. At least he didn't embarrass himself with a nude scene with someone young enough to be his granddaughter again. Uggghhh!! If you have an opportunity to view this movie run, don't walk, back to the video store and rent a superior film, you know, like Gigli maybe. OK I'm just kidding about the Gigli part."
"""Million Year Old Man with Babe"" is the most dreadful remake of every ""you really can make it"" movie ever made. And if that isn't enough, think ""disease of the week TV movie"" to get an idea of how this turns out. Add one bitter old man who's guff exterior is broken down by the young (and, of course, beautiful) girl who so reminds him of the relationship he wishes he had with his missing daughter. Then throw in unfeeling trailer trash relatives.Sentimentality drips through every pore; no cliché is left unused.Unfortunately, one could only wait in vain for Hervé Villechaise's immortal line, ""Boss, Boss, de plane, de plane"", that never came. Now that would have been worth an Oscar."
"This is the best picture of the year -- and Eastwood's finest since ""Unforgiven."" With ""Million Dollar Baby,"" Eastwood has crafted a powerful yet tender story of ambition and remorse, of fearless fighters and broken hearts. Like ""Mystic River,"" it's a tragedy -- but unlike ""Mystic River,"" it packs an emotional wallop, punching into the viewer gradually, jabbing and hooking, weaving a bit, then slamming the audience hard with tragedy, knocking us out with a painful blow that never once rings sentimental, or false. Freeman is superb, as always, while Swank proves the genius demonstrated in ""Boys Don't Cry"" was no fluke. Eastwood gives one of the most sensitive performances of his career. His score contains elements of ""Mystic River"" and ""Bridges of Madison County,"" yet seems perfectly suited to this, a completely different story. Tom Stern's moody cinematography and Henry Bumstead's decrepit sets are superb, often evoking a sense of the past, while never revealing a specific era. The fight scenes are among the most realistic ever filmed. All in all this Eastwood at his very best -- a true American artist who not only refuses to take off the gloves and leave the ring -- he simply gets better and better with each round. 10 out of 10."
"Thanks so much to all who commented NEGATIVELY on this clichéd slice of sodden lemon pie! All the glowing reviews were so wrong! ""You can't tell where this movie is headed."" Yeah, right. Like the second they show Big Bertha the Boom Boom Bear and mention she's a dirty fighter who doesn't care if her cheating ""could kill someone"" you're not gonna roll your eyes and think--""That will NEVER come up again will it??!!?? Give me a break. This movie has the worst script I've seen in a major film in years--utter sentimental garbage. Totally stereotyped characters. And speaking of stereotypes--how come all the good fighters are white and all the bad ones are black? If they hadn't cast Morgan Freeman they'd be open to some well founded racism allegations. What a complete piece of junk!"
"I saw Million Dollar Baby last weekend, and I was very surprised. I expected a movie about boxing to be a tad boring, but since it won Best Picture, I decided to see it. The acting was amazing, and Hilary Swank's character was so believable! I laughed and cried throughout the movie...and the story of the young woman's life was so incredible I wasn't surprised of the great reviews it received. I want to sob just thinking about it! I of course had to tell all my friends about it, and now we all want to see it together. I can't describe how touching this movie was, and I know that sounds cheesy, but it's really true. It seemed to make me forget everything going on in my hectic life for just long enough to indulge in the rare and beautiful story of a poor woman with nothing but hope and determination to be the best she can. Her innocence and sweetness adds so much to the plot. Also, Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman are awesome.. I recommend this movie to anyone, just have a box of tissues ready!"
"Million Dollar Baby is a great movie.Everything about it is extraordinary,the performance,the directing,the writing.It is easily the best Best Picture winner since 2000.It is a tragic story,Frank Dunn a boxer,and his friend Ed Dupris run a worn out looking boxing gym.Frank is training a promising boxer named Willie,but when Willie feels he is being held back,he leaves.Frank is hurt,but we find out he wants to protect his fighters after Ed lost his eye in a fight years ago.When he meets Maggie Fitzgerald a woman with nothing who decides to take up boxing.Maggie wants Frank to train her,Frank is hesitant but agrees.He and Maggie become good friends,and he is able to train her into a promising fighter.****Huge Spoilers Below***** Maggie is then paralyzed in the title fight,and Frank who has grown to love her has to decide if he wants to save her,or answer her prayers for death.Million Dollar Baby is a tragic story,it explores our characters,makes us care about them,and makes you think at the end.Clint Eastwood gives an astonishing performance,but it is in the director's chair is where he gets the gold,the film has a dark sad feel to it.Morgan Freeman gives another A+++ performance,I have never seen a performance by him I didn't like even in Bad Movies(Bruce Almighty) Hilary Swank is terrific in the title role,she soars.A very very high 4/4 even though I saw it today it is the best film of 2004"
"SPOILER ALERT! I enjoyed the cinematography. The gym looked great. Hilary Swank was good and the banter between Morgan Freeman and Clint Eastwood was highly engaging- but reminiscent of many ""buddies"" from many different movies. There was little original here.The strange character of Danger was, well, strange. In the end he seemed to exist primarily so A) Eastwood could say grumpy things about him thus appearing to be gruff and lovable at the same time, and B) so Morgan Freeman could have a moment of glory when he punches out Danger's tormentor. I didn't mind these moments in the plot, but we must admit that they are not the stuff of genius. Disney provided countless similar moments in their live action movies of the seventies (See the Herbie series).The boxing was utterly unbelievable for anyone who has actually watched boxing. However it was amusing to see Hilary knock out boxer after boxer much to her coach's- Clint's- exasperation.The final opponent- the evil woman who cheats and knocks Hilary out- would surely have been suspended several times based on the behavior depicted in the film. This might not be obvious to everyone- but boxing is not professional wrestling.Hilary's family is so ridiculously evil that I have to laugh when I remember them. The scenes of Hilary sitting by the hospital window day after day while her family went to Disneyland were painful- but not in the way they were meant to be.The final scenes seem like a vote for euthanasia and I felt a little ripped off. There is a great deal that's implausible in these scenes. Where does Clint find the needle and the drugs? How does he know what to do? Why don't the nurses on duty catch on? Why isn't there an investigation? But even more importantly- there was no need for the secrecy. As far as I understand, Hilary needed to be on a ventilator or she would die. There is no law that says you have go on a ventilator- at least not in the province where I live. She could have requested to be removed from the machine and died peacefully, without Clint's apparent heroics.Overall, very disappointing for a movie that was so hyped by critics. There was nothing outstanding about it. What was fun was far from original. What was bad was so bad that it seriously cripples the whole thing.I can't imagine why intelligent critics loved it in such large numbers. Had this movie been released in February, I believe many people would have cooled toward it by the time Oscar season rolled around. Now I fear it may displace superior movies at the awards show, causing future critics and fans to scratch their heads."
"Million Dollar Baby, I sit here watching it in 2008 and it is still as fabulous now as it was the first time I saw it in 2005. It is my favorite movie of all time: Clint Eastwood does a beautiful score, he is right on the money. The character development is so wonderful. The relationship between Maggie, Scrap, and Frankie is amazing.It's honest, and moving and sincere. There is no other movie that I love so much. A dear friend of mine is a paralyzed man who had that same glory prior to his accident that Maggie did. The way the movie touches on that is amazing. Maggie's heart and Clint Eastwood's conscious ... The speech she gives to him about ""going home buying a used trailer, deep fryer and some Oreos,"" makes me cry EVERY SINGLE time. It's the beauty in her face, her enthusiasm in working with him. If you don't enjoy this movie and it does not move you: you need to really re-evaluate everything in your life, my friend. The line, ""Yeah this is my fighter..."" Beautiful. Everything and I do mean EVERYTHING in MDB is beautiful. It's the best movie, I believe, to have been made in my life time. Thank you Clint Eastwood - for a life time of beautiful movie moments."
"It is a good thing I did not read Salon.com's review of Million Dollar Baby before I watched it. They derided it by stating that ""Clint Eastwood's boxing movie floats like a lead balloon and stings like a dead bee."" Well, I remember watching a lot of boxing at the National Guard Armory in Tampa 30 years ago, and I can assure you that this was not a ""boxing movie."" The boxing was incidental and only provided the backdrop. This was a story of dreams and failures, of backstabbing and cruelty, of wanting more than life gives you, working for it, and then having some slime ball steal it all when you are not looking because of jealousy. It was about those who take and never give, like the people who grabbed FEMA money in Miami for a hurricane that never came near them. It was the story of life. Real life in the trenches, not life as experienced by those who never worked for anything. It is not about Bush's or Kerry's life, it is about you and me. In that, it succeeded beyond all imagination and I plan to watch it again."
"Thak you Clint,Hilary and Morgan. You teach to Hollywood how acting!!!!how win an Oscar! This is the best Boxin' movie i ever seen. This is the best Drama Movie i've ever seen! the story is cruel, sad but ..real This is the real life, oyu can win but loose too, and if you loose you pay ..all!! the life of boxin' is hard and full of pain, Clint describe the emotion of the ring so well that the ring , the Gym the office became a magnetic and adventurous FILM. Thank you for the wonderful emotions and ...goodbye baby. Great Clint Great Morgan Great HilaryMarco"
"I think everybody who criticized this film either have not seen it or take the controversy about the film out of context. Now that I have actually seen the film, I feel free to comment on the controversy.Spoiler: Unlike in the Terri Schiavo case, in which the patient's desires are debatable, here it is not. Maggie wishes to die because she is not able to walk or move her arms. As a professional fighter, it was the only thing she was good at. Do I agree with her decision? I think it was her decision to make. Whether or not I agree with it is irrelevant. I do understand why she made that decision. If you put her decision in the context of the movie, people who criticize her decision will at least understand why. It is also not easy for Clint Eastwood's character to fulfill her wishes. This does not glamorize euthanasia, but sees it as a very difficult decision to make.As for the movie itself, it is a great story of a boxer, her manager, and a guy who works at the gym. They basically become a family. Clint Eastwood is the father, Hilary Swank is the daughter, and Morgan Freeman is the uncle. Since these three are estranged from their own families, they create a family of their own with their home in a boxing gym. All three of the performances are great and the film takes you on a journey where you want to follow these characters. I contrast that with Closer, which had good performances, but I didn't care the least about the characters or their situations. In this movie, you care very much. It deserved every award it got. 10/10"
"This is a movie which is up there with almost all of Clint's movies,And more so cause he directed this one.Don't know how he manages to get the story, actors and performance from the crew, so brilliantly synchronized time and again to get the Oscar nominations.The bonding between the characters has been portrayed very beautifully in this movie. Once I saw it, I was sure its gonna get a few Oscars among the categories it gets nominated for, and guess what it got the grandest of them all ""THE BEST PICTURE"" and of course ""THE BEST DIRECTOR"".I thought last year he was robbed out of it so probably made up for it this year.Just go and enjoy a real good movie.Better seen than being written I guess....... a real 10/10"
"It's really difficult to find any kind of words to describe this film greatness. What first seems to be a conventional boxing plot turns into an incredible, brilliant and devastating movie. Devastating is perhaps the right adjective to tell about the life experiences here handled. It also shows fight sequences but it's not about boxing at all, it's about second chances and love and also meditates on death, friendship and life failures. It's impossible not to be impressed with the grandness of the lead's performances and in particular with the level of perfection achieved by Clint Eastwood. The moving and emotional finale makes the audience wordless and breathless. Don't you dare miss this masterpiece!"
"Nothing about this film can be improved upon. I heard much of the controversy,but avoided all discussion regarding the surprise twist. So I went to the film expecting another Rocky. During the film I got the sense something unexpected was going to happen - the story was beginning to look like something that was becoming too good to be true for the fighter. Then I was pulled into the drama and the internal struggle the Clint Eastwood charter had to deal with. This film makes neither a pro or anti-euthanasia statement. There are many layers you can peel away and discuss - their meanings, morals, statements, messages and impact. I believed and could identify with the struggle both the Clint Eastwood and Hilary Swank characters went through. It's a powerful character study. You don't have to feel that it justifies euthanasia - it is a powerful drama with an abstract representation of how a handful of people dealt with triumph and tragedy. You can agree or disagree with the outcome, but that does not take away from the powerful impact. One sign of a great film is the controversy it can generate. And this film will be discussed for a long time. If you haven't already, go see it. Think about it and discuss it. It doesn't matter if you don't like or support the decisions made, but identifying with the depth of emotion and struggle will make you the better for it. 10 out of 10 stars."
"In my drive to give out my Oscars I am hurtling through the contenders. I was sure Mr. Foxx was a shoe-in for Best Actor in Ray. This however is the Best Picture of the Year. Clint could come away with three including actor and director. This movie immediately moves into my top 50 and it would win against much stronger fields than this years. I don't like - small spoiler- tearjerkers. This one crushed me. I will remember this movie and Clint reaching for new levels he had only hinted at. If they give it to Clint as Best Actor the age factor will tip the scales in his direction and he is unfortunately getting on in years and may not get another shot.John Wayne got it for the ""honor "" of the role he played - instead of Red River or the Shootist roles where he genuinely deserved to win. This one Clint has clearly earned."
"Frankie went to mass every day for twenty-three years because of guilt he felt about Scrap's lost eye and an undisclosed wrong of his that led his daughter to disown him. Finally, god heard Frankie's plaint and shed a tear for Frankie in the form of Maggie, a muscular bundle of desire and single-minded devotion. Maggie reanimated Frankie. In their short, intense relationship she gave him everything he had lost: a daughter's love, a desire to win (not just to train) and the opportunity to open his heart to her and shed his guilt. At the end, I was not sure that the movie was more of a moving love story or a dark, deep-felt tragedy, just as I am not sure if lemon meringue pie is sweet to the tooth or sour on the tongue. Or both..."
"I thought it was a great movie. If you have not seen it, You need to.I think that Hilary Swank did a great job, So did Morgan freeman. Did you know that this movie got 2 Grammy awards? That is why this movie is so good. I also liked the movie Girlfight,It was also a boxing movie.I think that Michelle Rodriguez did a great job in this movie too. Has any one seen this movie before? This movie is old. It was made in 2000. That makes it five years old.I think that Hilary,Morgan and Michelle has did more great movies.Has anyone seen the other movies that they have made? I think that most are good if not all of there movies are good.The movie million dollar baby is still in theaters,If there is somebody that has not seen it yet. Thanks,babygirl25"
"Clint sure knew how to hit the audience unguarded.When I was watching the movie I was expecting an encouraging girl-dream-come-true story. But the ending was so astonishing and hurting.The movie is great, Clint, Hilary and Morgan gave their top performance in that film while never overacted. The cast was simple and tense kinda helped the audience to focus on the main emotional interactions among the leads.And Freeman's voice was graceful.The story was conventional topics on boxing.But that was exactly what's so marvelous about this movie. They made a cliché into a touching masterpiece.There's a long time since a well-made movie came along. There's one regret though. I think the mother's behavior was exaggerated a little bit and appeared unconvincing. The cold-hearted thing in the hospital was just too much for a mother...just a thought"
"It's always difficult to be objective about a film like Million Dollar Baby. It's winning all the awards and getting lots of tens. When I walk into a theater to see something like this, the flick is already competing with Citizen Kane and Gone With the wind (or in this case Raging Bull and Somebody Up There Likes Me) rather than Kangaroo Jack or the Ghosts of Edendale.I tend to become hyper-critical on such occasions which negatively affects my ability to sustain disbelief. Since I am a boxing historian, this tendency particularly pervades my perception of boxing movies all of which seem way too fake and over-simplified as compared to the sport itself.One time I was covering a fight for Ring magazine and I walked into the dressing room where a manager was trying to force his fighter's fists into a pair of thumb-less gloves.A ruling had recently been passed in New York that preliminary fighters must wear thumb-less gloves as a measure to reduce eye injuries. This fighter had never even seen a pair of thumb-less gloves until five minutes before he was supposed to go into the ring against a local betting favorite. The scene in that dressing room ( ""I ain't wearing those f------ things"") was far more dramatic than anything I've ever seen in a boxing film and these guys weren't even in the ring yet.So boxing films can best be viewed as metaphors and as metaphors they can not be taken literally. Only in movies do fighters score one punch first round knockouts over and over again. Only in movies do fighters foul as obviously and flagrantly as do the heavies in the movies. On an on and on.So I'm sitting in the theater, aware of the maudlin, manipulating nature of the metaphor. I'm sort of rolling my eyes at the phoniness of it all, the clichés, the straight from Of Mice and Men story about Axel the Dog and the foreshadowing implicit within the tale. The too familiar technique of Morgan Freeman voice over. Certainly, our nation's critics couldn't be falling for this crap could they? And then, somehow, I too began to fall for it. I gave up the resistance which was futile anyway.I started pulling for Swank, the actress and Eastwood the director.Let's face it, Eastwood passed John Wayne as the the most iconic of American actors about five years ago and now he takes his place with Scorcese amongst our best directors and here he is playing an old man with no intention of getting the girl. At this point, I'm rooting for Clint more than ever and I've always been on his side ever since the days of Rowdy Yates in Rawhide.Freeman, yeah, we've sen this before too but ya know what? The reason we see it so often is because it works. I don't know what the thing with ""Danger"" was all about but even that worked sorta.And Swank. Top of her game.I'll be a fan forever.By the end, I forgot about the thumb-less gloves and the career of Clint and Glory and Insomnia and everything else except that I was sitting in a movie theater watching a great movie with my wife and daughter and all three of us were getting something from the film, something different for each of us, something we won't be able to articulate but may come back someday and provide us with courage and resilience in the clutch when we're on the ropes."
"My congratulations to Mr. Eastwood for sharing this very moving story with me, and the rest of the world really.Its is a very much talked about issue, deciding to end the suffering of a patient in much pain. I don't know if I could do it, you know, help someone to end it. Although I totally understand that she made this derision.I'm from the Netherlands so excuse my poor English. I wish I could say it in Dutch I would sound a lot wiser lol.But next to the PERFECT performances of the three main actors, I have to say something in favor of the Dutch lady who worked real hard on this film as well. Lucia Rijker, she trained miss Swank, and she played the part of the not so much loved Billie ""the blue bear"", yep the one who messed up Maggie's life. She did play Billie good, for starters, and she did an amazing job on miss Swank. I'm so proud of her. Very well done Lucia Rijker, I'm super-proud of you, you earned the Oscar as well.I see and agree with all the congrats to Mr. Eastwood and Miss Swank and Mr. Freeman. I just had to congratulate Miss Rijker as well.I loved the emotional side that Mr. Eastwood showed, he done it before I know, but I just love it when he does that. My dad loves his work as well, and I will tell my dad to go see Million dollar Baby with my mom. They will be moved just like I am."
"Until the Maggie's injury, the movie was a good-acting version of Rocky. From then on, it's nothing but drama, and trying-to-be one of those pessimistic disturbing dramas. Oh yes, the bad and sad ending is naturally inevitable, although sad doesn't necessarily mean bad every time.Every other frame of the first and the second part is just guessable and expected anyway.The first part is nothing but boxing, and everything seems to be a gift from heavens, until one disgraceful punch, where nobody in the movie could see it coming, even the referee, who warned the dirty boxer before. And this is where the second part begins: Nothing but trying-to-make-you-cry drama. Actually especially with the family acting so badly, and the family plot so bad, it actually *is* some funny drama, more like soap opera. (Yeah, you can come across the events in soap operas in real life as well)Be prepared to be disappointed while watching, or just love Eastwood, you'll love this movie. I wasn't well prepared, nor am I a big admirer of Eastwood (But I do admire him), so one of the most ""I was expecting much much better"" movies I have ever watched."
"MDB is a movie I adored when I saw it when it was released - even though my expectations weren't too high despite the raving press reviews, as I'm not interested in boxing. Seeing it again recently on DVD I loved it as much.So I've sifted through the (quite numerous) ""hated it"" IMDb reviews to try to understand why so many people didn't share my sense of wonderment at what I think is another Eastwood masterpiece. Apparently bad reviews fall in 3 categories: - people who were expecting a boxing movie (Rocky VI) and were disappointed. I can respect that but hey, what can I say? Wrong expectations. - people who disapprove of euthanasia, or who don't like sad movies altogether. Thats' OK, ""tous les goûts sont dans la nature"" (there's no accounting for taste?) - lastly, quite a lot of people -obviously cinephiles, some of them even Eastwood-fans (as a director) thought the movie was clichéd (simplistic plot, bad dialogue, stereotype characters, etc). Well, I can respect that - probably the movie IS clichéd and simplistic. Clint Eastwood the director has sometimes been compared to John Ford, because his art as a director goes right to the heart of the matter (the heart of human nature?) despite/through a deceptive simplicity. Maybe being foreign (ie French) had something to do with the fact I didn't find the dialogs corny, as some people apparently did, or wasn't annoyed by the ""Southern White Trash"" portrayal.Anyway... I just thought (still think) MDB is an absolutely wonderful movie, moving beyond description. It's compassionate but not melodramatic, it's beautifully directed and acted. It's a story of people who try to reach for the end of the rainbow, and ultimately fail - a parable of human condition, depending on your metaphysical outlook. Personnaly I can't think of something more moving or beautiful to spend 2-some hours with."
"The thing that strikes you the most while watching ""Million Dollar Baby"" is just how confident Clint Eastwood has become as a director. Armed with a good story, he allows the drama to unfold at its own pace, never feeling the need to fancy it up or hurry it along to cater to audience expectations. In fact, in every key area, this masterful film finds Eastwood - as both director and actor - at the top of his form.Eastwood plays Frank Dunn, an aging boxer-turned-trainer who has yet to hit the big time with any of his ""clients."" The gym he runs in a seedy part of Los Angeles seems more like a watering hole for outcasts and misfits than the launching pad for the next welter-, middle-, or heavyweight champion of the world. Then one day, into his gym, strides Maggie Fitzgerald, a wide-eyed girl from the Ozarks with dreams of making it big in the arena. Even though she has set her sights on Dunn as the man who will teach her, Dunn makes it clear to her that he has absolutely no interest in taking on ""a girl"" for training purposes. But when he sees her determination and fiery spirit, he agrees - however reluctantly - to show her the ropes. The film is an account of the warm relationship that develops between this old man - who has long ago lost contact with his own estranged daughter, and sees in Maggie, if only subconsciously, a chance to make some kind of amends for his own sins - and this feisty, full-hearted girl from the hills.Even though ""Million Dollar Baby"" has all the earmarks of a typical underdog sports movie, the film far transcends its genre through the excellence of both its screenplay and the performances by Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman, who, in the role of a former boxer himself and Dunn's closest friend, provides the voice of practicality and reason that permeates the film. His narration (as it did also in this summer's ""War of the Worlds"" and ""March of the Penguins"") lends the film the gravitas and classicism it needs to stand out from the crowd.Basing his screenplay on stories by Rope Burns, Paul Haggis has written dialogue that is astute, dramatic and authentic, far more literate than what we are accustomed to finding in most mainstream American movies. And, in his direction, Eastwood establishes just the right rhythm in the speech patterns to draw the audience into the center of the drama. Of course, Eastwood would never have been able to achieve this level of greatness without evoking strong performances from his assembled cast. As an actor, Eastwood himself has never been better than he is here. Gruff and cantankerous one moment, he is tender and warmhearted the next. Dunn has many deep-seated regrets about the past, but, even though his choices have rendered him virtually alone in the world, he still manages to remain both decent in his treatment of others and optimistic about the future. In her second Oscar-winning performance, Swank provides just the right mixture of naïve sweetness, openhearted frankness and unquenchable determination to bring Margaret to vivid life. And Freeman, as always, delivers a beautifully understated performance as the man of quiet perceptions whom Dunn has leaned on for guidance and advice for nigh unto thirty years. Together, this amazing ensemble molds what might have been a cliché-ridden tale into a work of art.Beautiful in its pacing and exquisite in its details, ""Million Dollar Baby"" is, without question, Clint Eastwood's finest film to date."
"For whatever reason, I did had reservations about going to see Million Dollar Baby. I am extremely happy that I decided to go because this movie was totally entertaining from start to finish. It simply grabs you and does not let up. Million Dollar Baby will be a keeper for my video collection! Eastwood, Freeman, and Swank all give superb performances and I sincerely hope they are given their due at the Oscars in March. The character's developed throughout the film and the actor's portrayal of them made the characters believable. Granted a few of the fight scene's were a bit over the top but then it is still Hollywood. What I like the most is the lack of special effects and the total concentration on the development of the story. Borrowing from Roger Ebert: Thumbs Way UP!"
"There is not much more I can add to the praise already posted about Million Dollar Baby. The acting, direction, lighting, cinematography, script, etc. were outstanding -- particularly Hilary Swank. Not a perfect film -- but very nearly. The best movie I've seen in several years.What amazes me is the reactions of those who hate the film...primarily because of the last third of it. Others have pointed out that this probably stems from the naysayers objection to being asked to really feel and think during a film that they anticipated as another Rocky. Eastwood didn't suddenly change directions -- the last third of the film is the point of his film. He didn't betray his audience -- everything before that final 35 minutes or so was the foundation for that ending.A movie that challenges us to examine our beliefs and preconceptions is a rarity these days -- at least in the US industry. By not supplying a lot of details about his characters, he was respecting his audience's ability to use little hints and nuances to grasp their backgrounds.Again, this is a wonderful film."
"I went to see Million Dollar Baby (MDB) with high expectations and a fondness for Eastwood's more compassionate works. I came out feeling mildly disappointed, but with an underlying uneasiness that gradually grew into distaste and even disgust.MDB is two movies, back-to-back. The first is an almost typical sports story, like ""Karate Kid"" or a thousand others. The ""almost"" qualifier is only because of the intensity of the Swank character's extraordinary humility and dedication, and the intensity of the resistance against her from Eastwood's character -- this was so extreme that its inevitable reversal seemed equally unmotivated. Realizing that this more-or-less standard inspirational success story was insufficient for Oscar material, Eastwood tacked on the second plot as a shameless tear-jerker. Both halves seem fundamentally trite, except for their exaggeration of the well-worn themes they exploit.It has been set so that dealing with any specifics of this second plot is considered a ""spoiler"", although I'm confident that by now anyone following the news knows full well what it is about. But it should be considered fair warning to prospective viewers to say that the protests from the community of persons with disabilities (against MDB's ""better dead than disabled"" message) were not only well-founded but given special poignancy by the recent death of one of Hollywood's real heroes (Christopher Reeves).The one-word summary of MDB's greatest sin is STEREOTYPING. Morgan Freeman's character escapes this and gives the movie the bulk of what substance it has (much of rest comes from a ""born-to-lose"" minor character boxer who manages to overcome the extraneousness of his part), but Eastwood and Swank's strong performances can not redeem the stereotypical characters they are condemned to play.But the very worst (again, because so exaggerated) and perhaps most important stereotyping was of the heroine's family. Actually, they were insufficiently drawn as a family to be a stereotype, but each of its members was a stereotype in the extreme: the pretty but spineless and dissolute (and obviously unwed) young mother, her hostile boyfriend who would have been considered a security risk by the Hell's Angels, and the fat-and-ugly welfare queen mother herself. The unifying factors of these three characters were (1) their lack of affection or sympathy for anyone in general and for Swank's character in particular, (2) their dedication to exploiting the welfare system for all they can get (which is implied to be supporting them forever despite the Clinton-era's ""welfare reform"" limits), and (3) their lust for Swank's money. Stereotypes all, but not just any stereotypes -- these are the wet-dream stereotypes of a right-wing ideologue whose goal in reforming the safety net is to destroy it.I am content with the Best Supporting Actor award, and I'm not going to argue with MDB's Best Actor or Best Director awards despite my suspicions. But why the Best Picture award? It is all too easy to suspect that it may reflect the Academy's wish to prove their political correctness and placate their right-wing critics, despite irritating the religious right with its more-or-less positive presentation of ""right to die"". In any event, it seems a travesty to present MDB as the Best Picture of the year."
"it was a breathtaking movie i have ever seen!the acting was flawless and i couldn't help my tears falling down at the end.i strongly recommend all of you to watch this masterpiece.i really really love and admire Clint Eastwood and his talent is for sure to be respected.Hilary Swank's performance was magnificent and in the film if i were in her position i would take the same decision as her.Morgan Freeman was also wonderful as co-actor.When seeing the trailers,i thought that it was a boring film because it was about boxing however when i watched the film my reaction was that'Oh my Godness!Why didn't i watch this film before?'"
"I hate to see everyone nitpicking at stupid details such as when Maggie goes down and hits her head on the chair, everyone is silent. ""In real life there is no way that would happen, fans would get up, throw things, the trainer would retaliate."" People, first of all, Eastwood isn't wasn't nor will he ever be a boxer. He could have chosen any sport or medium through which to tell his tale. Boxing and a woman just so happen to be great choices for a few reasons, #1 not everyday stuff (woman wanting to be a boxer) #2 great way to symbolize a desire and hidden feelings toward the unexpected for both the female boxer and the trainer. This movie was shot with such impeccable detail that you can bet 80% of most viewers have these things go unnoticed, and cannot identify them, yet almost all of these people are subject to the effect the cinematography has. THAT is truly brilliant. The subtleties like the noir-like voice overs and typical lighting (darker) and word choice in dialog esp between Swank and Eastwood as we see how Maggie truly loves her trainer as a father. And he the same. When Maggie falls down in the ring and gets injured, it is such a dark moment because Eastwood has realized the (in his mind) inevitable tragedy which he has led Maggie into. At that point in time, he already realizes retaliation would be of no use. I actually think that part is one of my favorites. Eastwood is so hit by the fall that he is already past anger and revenge. As if there was a part of him that knew this would happen and now he is feeling guilt and hopelessness. Its really an amazing scene. The filming of that scene also totally emphasizes his inner darkness and pain. This movie stays away from clichés and doesn't give the audience what it wants to see. It doesn't even deal with Maggies death in a ""noble"" way. Its very real. And that is shocking. This movie is 100% guaranteed to withstand the test of time. I don't know much about Clint Eastwood, but this is all I need to know. The man is brilliant. If you don't shed a tear in this movie, you have no heart. Swank deserves an Oscar, so does Eastwood for the directing. Freeman is the only Cliché (the wise old has been black guy) but if you study his character closely you will see how he is actually not clichéd at all. This movie is so powerful that you need a few hours to recuperate and that gut feeling you get during the movie sticks with you for days, and the appreciation will last forever. GREAT MOVIE. MASTERPIECE."
"I have always been a big fan of Clint Eastwood, both as an actor and a director. He is so modest and low key that people don't realize he directs the majority of his own films. I hope he retires because this is a wonderful swan song to a brilliant career. I felt like crying at the end of the film. Eastwood will be 75 in May and he looks every year of it, Morgan Freeman also looks terrible, but that suits them perfectly in the roles they are playing. In 1992, Eastwood and Freeman made movie magic in Unforgiven and lightning DOES strike twice in the same place here. Hillary Swank gives a knockout (no pun intended) performance as a woman who has nothing but a dream. Her youthful enthusiasm mixes perfectly with her trainers weary cynicism. Boxing is a seamy and brutal sport that this film captures perfectly, all the pain, hurt and dreams that never came true. The boxing scenes are a delight to watch. You have to wonder how many hours Swank actually trained to get all the moves down. It sort of reminded me of Rocky. However, in these movie fight scenes they throw more punches then in dozens of real fights! A boxer would be dead! SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT. Swank finally became champ in the end, only to have everything taken from her in the cruelest manner imaginable and forcing her trainer to make an unspeakable decision. Forget about the debate on mercy killing, it is just heart breaking to watch because Swank and Eastwood's characters were really like father and daughter in the end. Its all the more moving when it shows his wretched relationship with his own daughter and Swank's money grubbing, ungrateful white-trash family (I was hoping Clint would punch out that punk brother of hers). I think the movie would have been better off if Swank had just won the title and there had been a traditional ""happy"" ending. By the way, this is the only film where I have seen Eastwood weep on screen. He does it at the end when he unplugs her life support and gives her the injection. It is just gut wrenching. You just hope that Swank's character is wearing the crown of everlasting life instead of the championship belt."
"What can you say? Clint Eastwood is like a fine wine that just keeps getting better with age. ""Mystic River"", ""The Bridges of Madison County"", and ""Million Dollar Baby"" from a guy who made spaghetti westerns 40 years ago. Hilary Swank is an ""A"" list actress. This performance was on par with her portrayal in ""Boys Don't Cry."" Then, of course, there is Morgan Freeman. Well, actors just don't come any better than him. Too many great characters in so many outstanding films. ""Shawshank Redemption"", ""Driving Miss Daisy"", ""Bruce Almighty"" and on and on....So, what do you get when you take a great script, a quality actor/director, more quality actors and the big screen to showcase it all? You get one of the best films of the year and a film that will instantly be securely on the list of top films of all time.A great motion picture does not need awesome special effects, loud musical scoring, fad or fashion. It just needs plain old-fashioned quality film making where talented people perform at the top of their craft. Just like films such as ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" or ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", ""Million Dollar Baby"" will be as much of a gem decades from now as it is today."
"In a word this film is brilliant. The excellent script , the masterful direction and the strong performances catapult it into the higher echelon of Oscar winning films. The story centres around Frankie Dunn (played by Clint Eastwood , who was deservedly placed on the shortlist for Best Actor) a boxing trainer who has just lost his latest prospect to a rival promoter. Just before he is about to throw in the towel (or so to speak), he encounters Maggie Fitzgerald (an ambitious female boxer who asks Frankie to help train her). At first Frankie is not so sure ,he doesn't want to venture into the world of female boxing at his age. However Maggies drive forces him to take take notice . Soon afterwards he takes her under his wing and trains her for the big time.After a rocky start they become good friends , she even takes him to Missouri to show her mother the new house she had bought for her from the money she won in various fights and tournaments. However her ungrateful mother throws it back in her face leaving Maggie to seek comfort in Frankie. As time goes on she takes part in more and more fights and even adopts the Gaelic term Mo Chuisle (which consequently means My Darling). Very soon she becomes famous among the Irish supporters who fly the green , white and gold at every match.The films strong point is in the fact that the film is not primarily based on the popular sport of boxing. Many themes run parallel to this central event .It is because of these themes that the film is so good). As I said before the acting is top-notch . Hilary Swank won an Oscar for her excellent performance (her second prize for such a short career).Morgan Freeman also won an Oscar for his supporting role?narrator of the film . Although this is not his best performance it is a worthy accolade for a man who has previously been denied the big prize. If Jamie Foxx had not been in the running , Clint Eastwood would have a good shot at winning Best Actor but his awards for best director and best film more than make up for this. The film was also denied the best adapted screenplay award(which went to Sideways, which I have not seen so I cannot comment on whether it deserved it or not although director Alexander Payne has made such films as Election and About Schmidt).Although this is one of my favourite films it will not suit all tastes. People who dislike boxing because of its violent nature should steer well clear as the boxing in this film is of a graphic nature(which earned it its 16 rating in Ireland).Overall this is an excellent film so catch it if you can."
"This movie is not an action packed boxing movie, its not some random character drama. This movie is all of that and (no pun intended) a million times more. This film, directed by Clint Eastwood, is one of the best films I have seen in my life. It isn't original but this movie does such an amazing job of drawing you into the scenes and the characters and the fights that you will be cheering and crying throughout this journey. The best part is what you take away from this film, a mild sort of hope and despair. This movie blends it all so well that you get involved in the film and love every moment. The acting is some of the best of recent years and Hilary Swank, Morgan Freeman, and Clint Eastwood all give powerful performances that are just involving. You really get to know these characters as the film progresses and the story opens up. I don't think there was any film last year that came even close to the level of perfection for this movie. Everything done by this movie was just on the dot perfect, and this is possibly the greatest film of Clint Eastwoods entire career."
"If your not a fan of ""Clint Eastwood"" don't worry you will still like this movie! I am one of the few people who hated ""The Unforgiven"". I even hated ""Mystic River"" (To Me that was just an all star Law & Order Episode"") However this movie is what movie making used to be in the 1970's! This movie is one that will stay with you. The movie doesn't answer questions but dares to ask them instead. This movie is not preachy and shows the struggles of ""Free Will"" and dares to ask what is living without even asking outright! Right to lifers will hate this movie! But everyone has to ask ""What is Life""?! Also why should you impose your wishes on someone who has a different view? What makes one right and not the other? Clint Eastwood has brought us some of the best action movies ever made. Now he has made a movie that will make even Mel Gibson mad. What a guy!"
