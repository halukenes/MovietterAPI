Reviews
"Anthony Hopkins is simply astounding. The man can disappear inside of characters so diverse and capture you so completely, that you have to wonder if his well of talent has a bottom.This film is at turns charming, bawdy, fascinating, riveting, nerve wracking, hilarious, heartwarming and heartbreaking. As Burt Munro -- an aging New Zealand man losing his hearing, short on money, living in a shed surrounded by weeds, considered a lovable if eccentric oddball by all who know him except one small boy, and obsessed with making a 45 year old motorcycle capable of breaking the land speed record on the Bonneville Salt Flats -- Hopkins takes us along for the ride every minute of this movie. The fact that this film is based on the true story of Burt Munro makes it all the more captivating, but a lesser actor than Hopkins might very well have lost us along the way. It is no wonder that the children of the real-life Burt Munro were moved to tears by Hopkins' portrayal.There's a clever ongoing bit about the taste of Burt's hot tea, and you will also wonder a bit about how his lemonade might taste. Every scene is a jewel in this movie, and the cumulative effect proves that extraordinary films do not have to cost bazillions of dollars and take two years of computer-generated special effects to WOW their audience.Burt is challenged by every imaginable obstacle standing between him and his speed dream: his failing heart may give out any minute, the journey around the world to transport the 1920 Indian motorcycle to the USA seems insurmountable, he has no machine shop or whiz-bang tools and equipment to work his engineering miracles, etc. What he DOES have is an indomitable spirit that will never, ever stop trying. Whether he's battling young ruffians who diss his ancient motorcycle or banking, bureaucrats and red tape, he is a wrinkled but worthy warrior.The supporting cast is as beautiful and bizarre as it gets, and the audience becomes inordinately fond and just about every one of them except for a nasty foreign cabdriver (Carlos Lacamara), but hey, somebody had to be disliked. Great actors in small roles abound, including Diane Ladd as Ada, a frontier gal that's been lonely a while, Saginaw Grant as Jake, an ""Indian"" with a really distasteful solution to Burt's prostate problems, and Paul Rodriguez as Fernando, a human and humane used car salesman. Perhaps the best scene -- and heart -- stealer is Chris Williams as Tina, a cross-dressing front desk night clerk at a fleabag hooker hotel. You gotta love him. Or her, as the case may be. Stellar performance, and Hopkins' Burt treats Tina with such dignity it defines friendship.Don't miss this fine, fine film. And if there is justice in the boffo box office world, The World's Fastest Indian will be a true Oscar contender in 2006."
"It's a good thing I took my wife, because as all men know the only way not to cry is to look over at your wife/girlfriend and make fun of them for crying.Seriously, I am a motorcycle aficionado but I truly think this movie transcends that. It's not a ""guy's film"" at all but a serious look at the life of a man that was average by his own reckoning - by ours he's a hero. When you find yourself looking at that and saying ""I would have quit"" and it was only the beginning of the movie, well, that's some tough stock Burt Munro came from.And it's not tedious, not an uphill struggle all the way against insurmountable odds, none of those clich√©s. It's a great movie about a real guy and I can't imagine someone watching it and not being entertained, moved, and frankly, impressed."
"Seeing the movie ""The World's Fastest Indian"" reminded me why I go see movies. I average about one every two weeks, and this was one of those rare movies that actually made me feel *happy* afterward.The main character, New Zealander Bill Munroe as played by Anthony Hopkins, is a true man's man. He has spent his entire adult life tinkering with his streamlined motorcycle, a 1920 Indian (hence the title.) Now in his 60's in the year 1963, he wants to realize his life's dream of taking it halfway around the world to the Bonneville Salt Flats Test Track in Utah, the only place where he can find out how fast it will actually go.The movie pulls off two often-used themes, The Long Journey and Overcoming Adversity, without a hint of phoniness or melodrama. The Long Journey from New Zealand to Utah takes up most of the movie, with Munroe scrounging up travel money, working off part of his passage on a dilapidated freighter, and the long, event-filled drive from the California coast to Utah in an old used car. Overcoming Adversity is portrayed in two ways: by Munroe's awesome mechanical genius as shown by his ability to fashion spare parts out of almost anything and to improvise a la MacGyver, and in his charm and likability when confronted with more human obstacles. Indeed, one of the movie's chief strengths was the character's ability to make friends easily under any situation, with a cast of colorful supporting characters who wonderfully complemented Hopkins' acting.After finally reaching the test track, the movie's focus shifts from the acting to the cinematography and drama. The dozens of colorful cars, motorcycles, and drivers' outfits contrast strikingly with the blinding white of the salt flats and the mountainous backdrop. And when Munroe finally gets the chance to make his test run, two questions come to mind. How fast can he go? More importantly, will the 64-year-old man and the 43-year-old patched-up bike hold together under the strain?After seeing the movie and while still in my euphoric state, my skeptical mind wondered how much of it was actually true. I did a little research, and the portrayal of this amazing man seems to be true enough. Go see this movie; if you do, you'll leave the theater feeling good, and perhaps even a little inspired."
"I was lucky enough to see this film on a Qantas flight from LA to Melbourne early in December. My expectation was a low budget, low brow, attempt at making a motorsport film. I was truly blown away by what I saw. Anthony Hopkins deserves an Academy Award for the understated performance of Bert Munro. Always polite, and always focused Bert's dream get embedded in your heart and becomes your dream as well. The journey becomes the story with the characters he meets along the way getting obsessed with his vision as well. The scenes at The Bonneville Salt Flats are stunning and picturesque. I was left with a smile I couldn't get off my face and a tear in my eye. A simple film with a simple premise becomes my ""Best Of"" pick for 2005."
"I saw this film on a plane - I know, I know, the worst place to see any kind of film - and thought I would just fall asleep as I didn't expect it to catch my interest enough to put up with the bad audio and small screens. In any case I dislike feel-good movies, and all the Kiwi-innovator stuff makes me cringe, Kiwis don't have the monopoly on being resourceful. And I'd never heard of Burt Munro. So I was surprised to find within a few minutes I was entranced.Anthony Hopkins has made a brilliant job of the role, his accent wasn't too bad, and I loved the way he said ""Invercarrrrrrgill"". Hopkins' talent really shone - without him saying a word or changing his expression, you just knew how Burt felt when confronted by an apparently insurmountable obstacle (I won't spoil it) and his placid acceptance of the inevitable falls, tumbles and injuries told you that for Burt these were a fact of life. The other cast were also flawless, for me there wasn't a weak point in any of the acting. The humour was delivered in the main by Hopkins and with the lightest possible touch. The cinematography was beautiful and conveyed the journey from long quiet light of Munro's idealism in Invercargill, murky 'orribleness of the necessary evil of passing through LA and laying your dream on the line in the harsh open glare of Utah.Hopkins has done a few of these slightly-disreputable, love-em-when-you-get-to-know-em characters but this is the best. And I'm not a motorcycle fan, and no Kiwi-made-good fan, but I will confess to a tear (almost) at the end when the text came up about Burt's unbeaten record.If you watch this film at home you won't want to be disturbed by other people talking - you'll want to catch every word, every nuance."
"All I knew about this movie going in was that it was the life story of an Ivan Mauger-type motorcyclist whom I'd never heard of; that he was a Southlander; and that Anthony Hopkins was playing the chap - complete with a rolled rrrr's Southland accent. I came away with a feeling similar to when I first saw ""Tucker the man & his dream"" and ""Cool runnings"" - A genuine feeling of euphoria that someone whom I ordinarily would have little particular interest in, has accomplished a dream. Roger Donaldson has created a rare cinematic masterpiece with ""The world's fastest Indian"" - he has crafted a feel-good movie which achieves a ""Field of dreams"" emotional level with a climax which is deliberately low-key and in keeping with the subject matter. Despite the fact that Burt Munro's efforts set an as-yet unbeaten world record, he was a humble bloke who just went back to his shed at the end of the day to tinker. I loved this movie because it tells a straight-forward tale of someone so fixed on his dream that anyone he comes into contact with simply can't help but do what they can to help him. There are no villains in this movie - except bad luck and circumstance. And the way Munro overcomes adversity is incredibly charming, and an inspiration to anyone. Sir Anthony Hopkins is incredible, as usual. There aren't many actors who could pull off the Antipodean twang and the Southland R-rolling to boot! But Hopkins carries it off almost impeccably. The shimmering cinematography on the Bonneville salt flats is another highlight of this masterpiece, and I think I'm going to have to see it again before it winds up its run at my local cinema to fully appreciate it! (The first time I was too caught up in the agony of Burt's struggle!) This truly is a great flick. Probably not an Oscar winner, but for me, ""World's fastest Indian"" belongs alongside the aforementioned ""Tucker,"" etc. There's probably not much point in releasing it in the United States - it's not their kind of feel-good movie. But I sure hope Donaldson takes it to Cannes...the Europeans should like it as much as ""Whale rider."""
"'The World's Fastest Indian' is a unique movie that not only provides a film that New Zealanders anywhere can be most proud of, while at the same time contemplating universal themes that everyone outside the borders of the country can relate to.The film contains that familiar 'Number 8 fencing wire' mentality that resonates throughout New Zealand society - and also echoes those tropes of masculinity that are so prominent within the National cinema: Burt tinkers with his 1920 Indian Motorcycle with the most unexpected results, using common household objects; he travels to the Bonneville Saltflats in Utah alone, getting by on his wit; and has that dry sense of humour that is familiar around these parts. It also contains the familiar 'man Alone' motif, but in a foreign country, and also touches on that other image of New Zealand men tinkering in their sheds. The film is, what I would call, blatantly Kiwi.Wider themes that surface are of isolation, alienation, and beating the odds to achieve your dream. What I can definitely say about 'The World's Fastest Indian', is that it's very refreshing - this is no typical underdog story; it's a story that proves that you're never too old to follow through with a dream you've had for years. It was great to have a protagonist that was older than the usual one in contemporary movies, and seemed to give the film more of an anchoring in reality. It makes it far more easier to believe in the story and it's motivations, and heightens the sense of isolation one sometimes goes through when following your heart.Sir Anthony Hopkins does an amazing job as Burt Munro - the New Zealand accent is impeccable, aside from one or two vowel sounds. His subtleties communicate an intense psychological battle and determination to get the chance to achieve his dream, and his typical sense of humour is wonderful. I'm not sure how accurate this portrayal of Burt Munro is, but the screen character is engaging and pulls the audience in for a solid 2 hours as we watch Burt battle with his demons, and the lack of people's belief in his achieving his goal.All in all, 'The World's Fastest Indian' is a fantastic film that New Zealanders can be proud of, soaked with Kiwi humour and a character that will remind a lot of us of our grandfathers and that older generation that never complained and got on with life, no matter what they were up against. For international audiences, it's a wonderful underdog story about an older man who had never given up on getting his chance to achieve his dream.'The World's Fastest Indian' is a fantastic film, and will inspire anyone who gets the chance to see it. Roger Donaldson continues his fine tradition of great movies, and all Kiwis should hold him up to the same heights as they do that other Jackson fulla!"
"I took a look at this film with a slightly wary eye, the title being rather ambiguous and misleading initially. I almost passed it by to watch one of the many screener DVD's I had to view. for possible inclusion in the BAFTA awards. I presumed it was about a runner or maybe an Indian astronaut, possibly. I had no idea initially the ""Indian"" referred to a great American motorcycle,rather than a particular type of human.I am so glad I wasn't thrown by the title, and started watching. There unfolded a most delightful story about Bert, an instantly rather charming eccentric old character (superbly played by Anthony Hopkins), who built an old 1920's motorcycle in his garden shed. He then attempts to break the world-land speed record on a machine designed to originally travel about 90mph. The plot develops into a most charming and beautiful story of Bert's determination to get to the race event and the journey is as much of the story as the event itself. Obviously I shall not divulge the result or the events that happen, suffice it to say that Bert becomes an instantly likable character by everyone he meets. Bert's charm shines through and he takes everyone he meets at face value and welcomes all with a smile and a shake of the hand. He meets various ""characters"" along the way who he befriends like long-lost friends,which is a fresh in these days of prejudice and alienation. This was a very innocent time in 1967 for a New Zealander going to America, and there is one of the films most delightful and charming moments when Bert realises all is not quite what it seems when he meets one certain character......... MAKE SURE YOU SEE THIS FILM, it will have you laughing, crying and will uplift you, which is quite uncommon in these days in the movies of blood, killing, violence and savagery. I would be very surprised if Anthony is not at least nominated for his starring role as Bert. Lovely film which needs a different title to me, but then again ""it does what it says on the tin"", as they say. Go and see it. Great"
"A true story with a nice mix of emotion and motorcycles.At a sneak preview of this movie in Burt Munro 's hometown - Invercargill, I noticed at the end that many of the men had moist eyes -not that the film is weepy or sycophantic in any way - it's simply inspirational. The hero/underdog here is a social misfit, a self-confessed dirty old man but a lovable one. He loves the ladies and he loves speeding on his vintage Indian Scout ""modified somewhat"" along the open beach of Invercargill in Southern New Zealand. Beach bike racers still contest the Burt Munro Trophy on Oreti beach.Burt's 1967 record at Bonneville still stands. Anthony Hopkins manages the problematic Kiwi accent well to deliver a touching, funny and realistic depiction of Burt in his quest to be the fastest thing on two wheels. Sir Anthony said that it's the best thing he's ever done and it's hard to disagree based on his laconic and lovable portrayal.Outstanding cameos by the likes of Annie Whittle and Diane Ladd simply add depth and verisimilitude to the film. Tim Shadbolt, well he definitely acted in the film...Complete and convincing performances that warm the heart and show true humanity shining through. The cinematography is clear and precise, the action scenes are mercifully free of special effects and Burt's kiwi innovation and guile win the day. A new classic from Roger Donaldson."
"Greetings again from the darkness. Writer/Director Roger Donaldson has been very prolific in his Hollywood career creating mostly slick, ho-hum projects such as ""The Recruit"", ""Thirteen Days"", ""Dante's Peak"" and ""Cocktail"". Although there is a touch of sap in this one, Donaldson turns on the charm for the fascinating tale of Burt Munro, the New Zealander who shocked the world with his speed records in the 1960's.Playing a bit like a motorized ""Hidalgo"", the film captures your heart and imagination thanks in large part to the amazing journey of this spirited man and the terrific performance of Sir Anthony Hopkins. Making his way half way around the world with almost no money to his name, Munro realizes a life long dream of running his hand-built 1920 Indian ""motor-sickle"" at the Salt Flats of Bonneville in Utah. his journey and openness introduce him to so many people along the way. His warm heart and courage just will these folks to help him out. Everyone wants ol' Burt to make it.While you may think to yourself this is just a light-hearted Hollywood feel-good film, just remember the man and the story are real. Donaldson and Hopkins worked together over 20 years ago in ""The Bounty"" and have another very interesting project under way now with ""Papa"" - a biopic on Ernest Hemingway. Three supporting performances really stand out: Diane Ladd, (comedian) Paul Rodriguez and Christopher Lawford (Peter's son) as Jim Moffit. Donaldson, in a nice touch, also spreads in a few appearances of the guys from the high speed world.This is one you can take the family to and almost everyone will enjoy the story, journey and spirit of Burt Munro. And believe me when I say, you will never look at Lemon trees the same again!!"
"I am not a frequent movie goer, but when I saw the previews on TV I decided to go to the movie because there was a clip showing the Bonneville Salt Flats. I have spent a lot of time there as my recently deceased brother and my son both hold records on the flats. I went with absolutely no expectations other than to see the flats. I knew nothing about the movie. It was an incredible experience for me. The cinematography and the acting was excellent, but it is the content that makes the movie. Because of my association with the racers and their love of speed, I know how real this movie portrayed what they do and why they race. The racers and the officials were very real. This movie is absolutely RIGHT ON. It really hit home for me and was very emotional in places because it was so close to my heart. It is a must see and I have been telling all my friends. The message it leaves is very important and also helps me to deal with sons still pushing the edge. p.s. I read another comment saying this is no ""chic""film. I am a chic."
"I must admit, on this particular day I was dragged to the cinema with no prior knowledge of the characters, plot and had no awareness of the historical basis upon which the film is based. After a minute or so, I realized my partner (a fairly new motorcycle rider himself, making me a motorcycle widow of course) had lured me into a film about motorbikes. I rolled my eyes at him, yawned and prepared for the worst ...What I got instead was the best film I've seen for quite some time.Anthony Hopkins totally blew me away. His accent was really very strong (it should be noted that the Invercargil accent is pretty distinct from the rest of the South Island of NZ) and he managed to maintain the audience's interest though some pretty dialogue-heavy scenes. All of the supporting characters did a brilliant job defining a diverse physical and emotional landscape for the protagonist. The cinematography was economical and meaningful and assisted the humorous moments beautifully. The story unfolded very nicely and - thanks to some great editing - the small moments of tension were plentiful and kept the story moving along nicely.With all the cynicism and politics in contemporary cinema, it is so refreshing to see a film that is very pure, that speaks volumes about kindness and passion and friendship without saying anything at all. This film didn't try to make any big statements, there were no lengthy diatribes about 'acceptance' and 'tolerance', and I loved that.I left the cinema with a huge grin on my face. I'm so glad I was dragged along for the ride."
"Truly hidden treasure. Movie was playing at an obscure art theater in Pittsburgh, a friend saw it and told me about it since he knew I like bikes and have just recently returned from a very eventful bike trip in Nevada following a dream in the desert. Just like Burt. On a motorcycle. There is something absolutely magic about motorcycles, the desert, helpful strangers and nasty cops, last minute solutions and dreams. Most of all dreams. The kind that inspire anyone that crosses the dreamer's path. Well, the movie is not accurate in every detail but it's such an inspirational story I would recommend it to anyone that likes the classic underdog scenario. And this one is set in the Salt Flats desert! With Anthony Hopkins! And motorcycles! Great set, great story, great acting, great everything! I am SO surprised this movie is so unknown!"
"I'm a geezer now, as was Bert Munro during the period this film depicts, but when he was setting the records at Bonneville, I was a very young, and very broke, motorcycle racer. I even had the honor of meeting Bert briefly when he was in California.But that's not what this review is about. It's about the absolutely amazing attention to detail in the film. Munro's bike, the shop, the tools, the cobbled-together machinery, the low-tech transportation, ... all dead on the money in authenticity. The entire film is like a string of old racing photographs, come to life.Anyone interested in what really went on back then, before full-ride sponsorships and corporate super-events became the norm, should see this film. Even the audio is authentic. When Mickey Thompson's 4-engined, 32-cylinder ""Challenger"" rolls off on a land speed run, that's the actual sound of the original runs you hear in the background.I have to admit that when a replica of Dr. Nathan Ostich's ""Flying Caduceus"" rolled by in one scene, I got a bit of a lump in my throat, remembering those who died in their attempts to ""be the fastest"". Despite the light-hearted goofiness shown in the film, never forget that these people were deadly serious about a seriously deadly sport. Land Speed Record racers were a special, if slightly odd, bunch. Even those of us who raced ""normal"" events were a bit in awe of the ""LSR people."" As someone else mentioned, there are a few corny scenes early in the film that might make the purists wince a bit, but the payoff is worth it. Anyone who lived through those times will instantly recognize the slightly over-bearing track officials, and the (fortunately) loose attitudes towards rules-bending.All in all, this film perfectly captures a time and an attitude that we will never see again. Racing is definitely safer now, but we're only having one-tenth of the fun and satisfaction Munro experienced, way back when."
"I used to own a gas station in a small town in West Texas right where the Hill Country ends and the desert starts. On a bright Summer day a rider on an old BMW rolled up to my pumps. Being a motorcycle rider myself I walked out to greet him.As I approached, and greeted him, he held up a gloved hand. He slowly stretched it out and flexed his fingers and then did this with his other hand and then slowly, with a little bit of difficulty pulled off his helmet. His head had a shock of snow white hair. He had a white beard and eyes that were a stunning shade of sky blue. His smile belied not only and easy friendship but an experienced wit. Looped around his head was a clear thin plastic hose that ran down into a small tank bag to an oxygen tank.He told me he was 82 years old and had been riding motorcycles for 60 years. His old BMW had 200,000 miles on it and he had ridden it in 20 countries on 5 continents. He said he had been diagnosed with cancer and had outlived his doctor's prediction of his demise by two months so far. He had been on the motorcycle since the day of his doctor's prognosis and would continue until he died, which he admitted would not be long. There was not a single inkling of sadness in his eyes. Just merriment and passion. This old man was doing what he loved and was going to go out on his terms after living an amazing and enviable life.I imagined, time and time again, what having such passion for something could be like. I love my bikes. I am passionate about my occasional days at the track, but it does not match what I saw in that old rider that day.Then I saw Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Munro and it became so clear. I wonder if that old man ever watched ""The World's Fastest Indian."" If he had, it would have spoken directly to his soul as it did to mine.This movie had such heart. A story about the triumph of the human spirit. Only ""Rocky"" comes to mind as a movie with such a soul. I recommend this picture to everyone I talk movies with."
"A friend and I went to see this movie with some trepidation as neither of us wanted to see some boy-toy rubbish about piston rods. But the IMDb reviews were so good that we decided to take a chance. We were both so glad we did! Not only is this movie entertaining from start to finish, but it features one of Anthony Hopkins greatest ever performances (which is saying something) and was laugh-out-loud funny to boot! Hopkins depiction of Munro was immaculate. the movie left me wishing I'd known the man, and Hopkins perfectly captures the unpretentious, friendly character of many New Zealanders which made Munro an innocent abroad when he took his bike to the Bonneville Salt Flats. I wondered how Roger Donaldson was going to make this movie interesting, but it's really gripping throughout. Munro's character has a lot to do with it, but it's also more of a road movie than a film about motorcycling. Munro's journey from his garden shed to the record books is a delight and an inspiration. There are some terrifically funny lines in this film which emerge simply from Munro's down- to-earth character. The audience we saw it with was really amused. We didn't expect it to be so funny. As usual, the only downside is that this film doesn't seem to be getting the attention it deserves. If I hadn't seen the IMDb reviews and just returned from a trip to NZ myself, I would have missed the best movie of the year so far. All involved with the making of this film deserve the highest praise."
"Wow, we just saw the film last night, what a wonderful depiction of a great life and a true character! Our local 'arthouse' theater was showing the film, only 2 nights (part of a film festival - sold out both shows). We expected the crowd to be full of kindred old-bike souls, but found ourselves surrounded by yuppie young'uns with no connection to motorcycling.I was very interested to see how they would respond to the film. From the first line, they laughed, then thoroughly enjoyed it to the end - even applauding as the credits rolled.I wasn't expecting much from the movie ¬ñ since usually anything involving motorcycles on film just makes me grit my teeth in frustration at the sheer ignorance of the directors/producers.This movie was completely opposite. Not only did it do a wonderful job at depicting the bikes and riders JUST RIGHT, it also did something wonderful ¬ñ it made even the non-riders in the crowd feel (just a little bit) what it's like to ride a fast bike. The sheer joy of speed, with your body inches off the ground, and nothing protecting you but your own skill and the quality of the machine you've built.Also, having toured the back roads from California/Oregon through Utah quite often, the landscape and regional town shots really made me want to get on my bike and run through there again ¬ñ right now! Taking backroads, you can find those little cafes in tiny towns that time forgot ¬ñ it's one of my favorite reasons to ride.Anthony Hopkins was perfect ¬ñ played the part perfectly and was supported expertly by an exceptional cast of characters. Seeing some of the old legends of the sand (like The Redhead, and its owner) was just icing on the cake.All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable movie. I can't wait to see it again."
"What a great film. A real sleeper, one has to wonder why it didn't make more money? Actually that makes me like it even more, and I can't help feeling Roger Donaldson's underdog Bert Munro character tells us something of Donaldson's own journey through life.Anyway on to the film.There is more soul in this films two hours, than in the last two (maybe 10) years of Hollywood flicks. No one gets killed, no one gets shot or shot at, virtually every character is so memorable, and yet totally believable, not to mention so well played.I'm wondering where all these great actors have been hiding. (more about this later)Special effects are exactly what they need to be, not Hollywood overblown, just totally transparent. Anyone who has ever raced a machine right on the limit, or rather not knowing where the limit is, will be in awe of how they captured those moments in the film, that rush, blur, and vibration that seems part of you, to the extreme your very eyeballs vibrate in your own head, blurring even further.More than one scene left me wondering just where the world has gone wrong today, and long for those days, when people were still people, and prepared to make an effort to help a total stranger, so obviously out of his element in a far off land. I haven't been to Utah, but I hope there are still people there today, like they were in the 60'sAnother appealing asset, is a total lack of Hollywood marketing hype, and no need to suspend your disbelief¬Ö.. (as they so love to say)No, this is a REAL film, about a real guy. I can't help wonder, if the Hollywood marketing bods, missed the point totally, After all dealing with reality is not a strong point in marketing circles ;-)Speaking of missing reality, that reminds me. MPAA, Rated PG-13 for brief language, drug use and a sexual reference. Who are you kidding? DRUG USE! Your all fired! I'm sorry but I don't believe even the bureaucrats at the DEA, have listed ""ground up dog's balls"", Or medically prescribed Nitroglycerine tablets, (used since the early 1900's to this very day) It's only just a little over ONE hundred years of history guys. I guess you don't get out much.Well what else can you say about Sir Anthony? Sir Anthony Hopkins is a great actor, as I think most will agree, And this film proves that yet again, in a not at all typical role for him. His chameleon like skills put him right in time and place and character. I'm not quite convinced with his Southland accent, which is not quite flat enough IMHO, but all same, it's a good attempt, probably better than mine, (and I'm a Kiwi) Regardless, he captures that ""I can do that"" Kiwi attitude so well, and delivery is timed to perfection.Christopher Lawford playing Jim Moffat is SUCH a standout too. From his first scene, the moment he climbs out of his car, you KNOW he's a speed freak. He has that laid back Southern California poise, tan and smile, with his 1000-mile stare. I was racking my memory to recall a 1960's racer of that name, before realising the character he plays is a composite of several real racers. Absolutely convincing!Bruce Greenwood plays a more minor role, but nails it also. I loved the scene when he first meets Munro, and can't tell what to make of him, What a classic.Speaking of classics, Chris Williams, Tina character is hilarious. Especially in the scenes where she tags along with Munro, and the reactions to the bizarre duo.Finally Jessica Cauffiel. What a darling. A sweet 60's belle, with a heart and smile bigger than a mountain. She totally steals more than one scene from Sir Anthony.It is a very rare film indeed that can appeal to men and women, boys and girls of all ages, after all everyone has their dreams and ambitions, and asks ""what if"", even though we so often forget them as we get older, being reminded of them by a film is no bad thing, and it bonds with you along the way. Yet it takes it's time, and tells the tale with a deliberate style, and finesse. Like this film Munro was a larger than life character, who REALLY did things in HIS time.This is a feel-good film, about humanity, spirit, and passion for life, and living your dreams, whatever your age."
"Don't get scared by the title of this movie, this film is just awesome, i cried,and literally shivered because i got so touched by some of the scenes in this film.I have only cried in about 2-5 films ever, but never have i cried in a film because i was glad.The storyline is just amazing, anthony hopkins performance is just totally awesome, you just fall right into the story and pay close attention and love every minute of this film.The script is so original and almost unlike everything i have seen.This is a drama where there is not one second of boredom, it keeps you on your toes the entire movie. It touched me emotionally in a way i haven't been touched since i was a very young boy and saw rocky1 (young boys tend to love that movie). The characters are so funny and they all have a little weird side to them that is lovable, this amazing story with a fantastic end put a smile on my face for more then a day when i finished watching it, i couldn't believe it.I thought i never would see a film in my life again that would actually go straight into top 3 all time films ever without a doubt, i thought i had seen it all, boy was i wrong!.Anthony Hopkins character is impossible not to fall completely in love with right away, he is lovable, weird, funny, completely ignorant, totally stubborn, has a goal and a will to follow his dream.he fits the role of the weird kind man that lives down the street so perfectly and so realistic that it becomes completely obvious that this is a true story, its just too good not to be.For everyone: I recommend this movie with total conviction.I Challenge you to say you do not love this movie, i honestly can't see how anyone can not love this movie....It is in my opinion the best film ever made."
"Anyone who has ever dedicated himself to anything has to love Burt Munro, his quest for speed and this movie. I read elsewhere that, in one 10 year stretch, Munro worked 16 hours a day with the afternoon off each Christmas. That will surely qualify as dedication. Anthony Hopkins portrayed the NZ aspect of the character brilliantly as I have been there and seen the frankness with which problems are dispatched. For example: ""Screw it!"" in response to the problem with asbestos protection. It is only fitting the 1000 cc land record has survived nearly 40 years. Congrats and gratitude to all involved for the existence of this movie. It is a marvelous story depicting how much can be achieved with ingenuity coupled with modest means. It is a must see!"
"We very much enjoyed this film, even though we had to watch it on a small screen in a relatively obscure theater. The true story of a New Zealand hero is a classic and deserved a great film. Here we have it. With minimal pretension and just the right combination of drama and laugh-out loud comedic relief, this film entertains on every level. One can't help but fall in love with the legend that is Burt Munro, and be inspired by his legacy of tenacity and endurance. Although the story is of a New Zealander in the 1960s, the journey Munro takes is universal. His determination to live his dream is a theme everyone can understand. I thoroughly recommend this film to all ages and walks of life - there's something in this film for everyone."
"This was an interesting story of an older, poor guy traveling all the wayfrom New Zealand to the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah to try to set a world speed record on his motorcycle. With Anthony Hopkins playing that man, ""Burt Munro,"" you know it's not some hokey little B-film. It's also based on real-life character who did this back in 1969.This film reminded me of ""The Straight Story,"" starring Richard Farnsworth. That dealt with an old man taking a long tractor ride across the state of Iowa to see his dying brother. It featured a bunch of nice characters he met along his journey. This is much the same as we witness Munro's encounters with a variety of people in the United States. Like ""The Straight Story,"" all the people are good people and help our man. That's nice to see.Once he finally gets to the Salt Flats, however, his problems are far from over as he is unable to meet any of the minimum safety standards. It appears he made his trip for nothing, but, you'll see what happens if you view this movie.New Zealanders say Hopkins did them proud, too, and they would know if he did a good job or not playing a man from their area of the world, whether he sounded and acted realistically. They say he did.I enjoyed the first 35 minutes of this story the most. Maybe because that's the most innocent part of the film and features a young boy who looks up to Burt and encourages him when few others are willing to do so. It's when Munro reaches America where the ""nice, clean family film"" goes south a bit. He hooks up with transvestites, one-night stands, profanes here and there and the PC angle gets a little overplayed. However, despite making America look a little too weird, everything is done is a tasteful way and it still was a wonderful story. It has to be an inspiration for older folks who might think life's challenges are over once they hit a certain age. Not so, as Mr. Munro shows us in this inspiring, well-photographed film.This certainly is quite an unknown movie for one which has such a famous actor in the starring role. It's well worth your time, though, to check out."
"Invercargill, New Zealand, is noted for being the country's southernmost city and for having the least hours of sunshine and the most number of rain days of any NZ large town. It is also famous for being the home town of a gritty old codger called Burt Munroe who set a number of world motor cycle speed records (one of which still stands) in the 1960s at Bonneville Salt Flats, Utah, riding a 1920 Indian Scout motor cycle.Roger Donaldson, one of the midwives to the renaissance of the Kiwi film industry in the 1980s (""Sleeping Dogs"", ""Smash Palace"") and latterly Hollywood director (""Thirteen Days""), made ""Offerings to the God of Speed"" a documentary on Burt in 1972, when he was still alive. This dramatization of the same story ¬ñ little man triumphs though sheer grit and determination ¬ñ is a triumph for his star. Anthony Hopkins is good at quirky curmudgeons but here he manages to exude a little homespun charm as well. His Burt has the happy knack of getting people to help him rather than shaft him. Officialdom melts at his approach and he is even attractive to the ladies, as Burt would have put it. It's Tony Hopkin's film and he carries it off in fine style. I'm not sure about the accent which is more northern British than southern NZ but it hardly matters as the Americans in the film can scarcely understand it anyway.The rest of the cast were all adequate and Aaron Murphy as Tom the kid from next door was actually able to steal some scenes. I also noticed an old acquaintance in a minor role as Frank the bike club president - Tim Shadbolt, student radical of the late 60s and now mayor of Invercargill. Burt had no money but he did get community support at various times, so Invercargillians can take some pride in his achievements.Which brings me to what I think is the hole in this account. The Indian motorcycle, which was a light machine used for dispatch and scout work in World War One, had a top speed, according to the makers, of 57 mph. It had a V-2 cylinder block design and a decent capacity of just under 1000cc. Burt was a backyard mechanic who constantly tinkered with it, even casting his own pistons, which blew with monotonous regularity. Somehow he got the thing to exceed 200mph. No doubt the streamlining helped, but he must have modified the original design radically. Donaldson presents this without any explanation. Maybe Burt wouldn't tell him, or maybe Donaldson thought too much tech stuff would put the punters off. It wouldn't have taken much to explain it.As others have said, this is very much a ""feel-good"" movie and I think, as an ex-resident of NZ, evocative of some of the more admirable aspects of the NZ character ¬ñ the optimism, the friendliness, the capacity for improvisation and the willingness to rise to a challenge, and even occasionally to take risks. Burt had a lot in common with those pioneer settlers from Scotland who arrived in Southland 100 years earlier and founded Invercargill, a place the Maori sensibly regarded as a trifle too chilly to actually live in (though they visited for the oysters and muttonbirds). But he also had some home-grown attributes as well. ."
"It is refreshing to see what a film maker can do when he dispenses with car chases, gunfire, fiery explosions, and cartoon- like digital effects and returns to that one core value-- quality and talent. Anthony Hopkins scores a tour de force with his portrayal of Burt Munro; it is like watching a master at his craft. His looking through his old family photo album with the young boy ""...here's Ernie, there's my Mum....they're all gone now.."" is as moving a scene as the one in Honkeytonk Man where John McIntire talks to his grandson about what it was like in the Oklahoma Land Rush of his youth. Subtle, underplayed, but filled with deep emotion. This isn't a ""motorcycle movie""; it's simply a kind and gentle tale that inspires dreams. A thoroughly enjoyable film. As Burt says when he finally sets foot on the salt of Bonneville, ""...big things happen here...this is Holy ground, Mate!"""
"My daughter urged me to watch this film after she & her partner had seen it. Some few months later I did so. It was all she said it was. One of the loveliest films you will ever watch, it's based on the true-life story of New Zealander Bert Munro, who spends years rebuilding an Indian motorbike & takes it to Salt Lake Flats in Utah, in an effort to beat the land speed record. Bert's charming naivety & amiable, easy going manner captures the hearts of all he came across on his journey. The type of human being you would expect to meet in Utopia, Bert is a wonderful character. Anthony Hopkins is outstanding in this so feel-good film. It makes one take stock of how we view life & treat other people, makes you feel very humble to have known Bert, albeit on a film screen & only for 90 or so minutes. Wish that we were all like Bert, what a nicer place Earth would be."
"The World's Fastest Indian I had read about this movie about 4 months back when it was released in Amsterdam. I did not see that movie at that time. After that the movie was running in other cities in Holland, where I could not go to see it. So when I got to see this movie in the North West Airlines while traveling from Amsterdam to Sydney ¬ñ I did not miss this opportunity.At the prime age of 70 this multi talented actor, director, composer, writer, and producer does not stop amazing you with his talent. I am talking of Sir Anthony Hopkins. He plays the role of Burt Munro ¬ñ a real life old character who took part in World War I, and is staying in eastern corner of a peaceful town in New Zealand. His passion in life is his old Indian motorcycle of 1920s that he is innovating to participate in the American speed racing. The year is 1967, and the story is about Munro's weird ways and eccentric character; his journey from New Zealand to USA and his charm with which he wins hearts of people to give him help and a way to stubbornly participate in the motor speeding event. The movie culminates in an unbelievable thrilling exciting finish.Anthony Hopkins plays this memorable role with ease. The role is so alive that it inspires all of us even in the most painful moments of his old life. When we see him suffering from weak old legs, persisting heart ailments, and breathlessness and sagging body ¬ñ Munro remains natural and at ease without bothering about such things ¬ñ rather keeping his focus on the event.There are many different characters who meet Munro along the way to reach the event location - who laugh and doubt at his dream. Each sub-plot of different characters is presented with exact length without making any portions of the film boring.I liked the cinematography - some shots and photography are very well executed. Sadly Anthony Hopkins has not been nominated for any ""Best Actor"" category in any awards.Just a few trivia - the director ¬ñ Roger Donalson - made his debut as a director in a TV series for the same story in 1971, where he played Burt Munro's old character at his prime age of 26. It has been 37 years since then and 16 movies later the Roger at the old of 62 requests 70 years old Anthony Hopkins to make this character immortal on screen ¬ñ and does he succeed? Yes he does.Last note for our readers ¬ñ the actual record set up by Burt Munro in 1967 of racing at more than 200 Kms per hour speed by a less than 1000 cc bike still remains unbroken till date after 30 years ¬ñ and that too Burt Munro used 1920 bike model and he was 58 years old when he set that record.Is not this absolutely amazing and inspiring? Thanks Roger Donalson for bringing back to life Burt Monro through Sir Anthony Hopkins.(Star 7 out of 10)"
"Forget Hannibal Lector. Anthony Hopkins playing Burt Munro becomes the character. He is crusty but lovable. Hopkins and the rest of the cast take us on a road trip spanning New Zealand to the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah and the audience can experience the entire ride and the intriguing characters that we meet along the way.This is a movie of one man's passion and his quest for immortality. Think of Hemingway's ""Old Man and the Sea"" but with lots of characters.The writing is so good that there is not a dull minute in the film. The cinematography and the music score add to the experience.Its too bad that the movie is scheduled for limited release. It will truly be an enormous crowd pleaser. Don't miss it!."
"I knew nothing of this film before seeing it. This film is just plain terrific on so many levels. The performance of Sir Anthony is one of his best. The ensemble, whether in New Zealand or the US, is top flight. Rodger Donaldson's story and direction show a true work of love. This film is filled with amazing moments. The dialog and interplay of the characters is rich and utterly believable. The fact that someone so unknown to the general public has such a rich story waiting to be told is such a great unexpected gift. You don't need to know a wit about motorcycles to get ALL of the value from this film. And yes the end will draw a tear or four no matter who you are. Thank you Rodger Donaldson for your gift of this movie."
"I thought was a very good movie and I'll readily admit that a few scenes got me a bit misty eyed. Hopkins, as always, did an excellent job portraying the character of Burt Munro. The directing was great as well. If I had one complaint it would be that there was not enough automotive eye candy. I thought it could have been a just few minutes longer and they could have used the time to pan the camera down the length of that motorcycle at least once. This was a movie about a guy with a passion for motorcycles and the biggest share of their audience will be guys that share that same passion...and they want to see that motorcycle. They also could have given Burt/Hopkins some dialog where he explained some of the modifications that made a 45mph motorcycle go 200+mph. And a few close ups of those beautiful Brit bikes on the beach would have been nice. Plus the cars at Bonneville. About 15 more minutes would have made it an even better movie for me."
"I first saw the movie Worlds Fastest Indian in a small ski-resort community high in the Colorado mountains (Breckenridge) that is predominantly inhabited by 'tree-huggers' and self-proclaimed environmentalists. I would judge the community in general to be the furthest thing from motor sports enthusiasts that one could imagine. I viewed the movie in a small public theatre with about 100 seats. Surprisingly, it was filled to capacity. When the movie ended, the ENTIRE audience stood up and applauded! I am 72-years old and I can not remember seeing this happen with any other movie in my life!I subsequently bought the DVD and show it to my friends, family and grandchildren often."
"This isn't a movie in the Hollywood mold, so if you want frenetic action and state of the art special effects, forget it. Its a heart-warming true tale of one of those actual characters we sadly come across only occasionally in life these days.One of the genre of New Zealand real life, quietly heroic movies we're getting to like, this tale of achievement against the odds nails the traditional kiwi 'can do' spirit of invention and the minimization out of existence of obstacles. It also portrays a delightful, almost quaint by today's standards, spirit of true sportsmanship among American speed racers.Being a kiwi, I'm no doubt a little biased, but I don't think anyone with a heart could help but thoroughly enjoy this great little movie. Maybe its a predictable midlife reaction, but I left the theater after this movie a little more determined to pursue a dream or two of my own, however small they may be by comparison."
"I'm not usually drawn to ""feel-good"" entertainment, not because I like to feel bad but because so often these films are pedestrian, manipulative, and without charm. Anthony Hopkins' performance, however, as Burt Munro in Roger Donaldson's The World's Fastest Indian lifts the film to a different level and, though we may have seen movies in this genre many times before, the result is irresistible. For those who never heard of Burt Munro, he was the eccentric 68-year old New Zealand cyclist who set the land speed record at Bonneville Flats, Utah of 201 mph in 1967, a record that still stands today. The World's Fastest Indian is not only good family entertainment (perish the thought), but has a spiritual message about the power of intention to create support in our life.Hopkins portrays Munro as a charming rogue whose greatest asset was his enthusiasm and determination. Munro dreamed about being able to compete in a race to determine the world's fastest motorcycle for twenty-five years and the film chronicles his unrelenting pursuit of that goal. Hopkins turns in one of his best performances in years, captivating us with his Kiwi accent and his sly laugh, the personification of the ordinary man fighting the system for overdo recognition. His instrument of choice was a modified 1920 Indian Scout motorcycle that he spent his years in Invercargill, New Zealand tinkering with and honing to perfection. The cycle had been scraped together with hinges from a kitchen door and a cork from a whiskey bottle and with the tread of its tires carefully sliced off with a knife it hardly looked like it could go around the block much less set a speed record.When we first meet Burt, he is an old man who lives alone and regularly comes into conflict with his neighbors for racing his motorcycle engine in the early morning and totally neglecting the condition of his lawn. His best friend is the neighbor's little boy (Aaron Murphy), a captivating redhead, who is fascinated with the ancient machine and loves to talk with Burt about his plans for the big race. Suffering from money problems as well as heart and prostrate trouble, neither Munro nor the old Indian Scout bike seem to be in any shape for an arduous journey, let alone to race for a record. Thanks to the help of a local club and a friendly bank, however, he is able to raise enough to cover most of the trip but has to pay his passage over by working aboard ship as a cook and dishwasher.Once in America, Burt meets some ""colorful"" characters and here the film sags a bit with some well-worn stereotypes. In Hollywood, he is assisted by a transvestite hotel clerk (Chris Williams), a Hispanic used car salesman (Paul Rodriguez), and, along the road, a soldier on leave from Vietnam, a native Indian who has the right cure for his prostate problem, and a widow (Diane Ladd) who has the right cure for his nighttime urges. Donaldson also depicts cops who graciously do not cite him for speeding on a vehicle without license plates. When Burt gets to Bonneville, he must use all the power of his strong intention even to qualify as he failed to pre-register and his cycle does not meet minimum technical standards. Another savior comes to his aid here as an American racer played by Chris Lawford, the lookalike son of actor Peter Lawford, pulls his weight with the officials and Munro is allowed to compete. Even though we know the outcome, the racing sequences at Bonneville are exhilarating.While The World's Fastest Indian sounds like a typical formula exercise of the underdog fighting for glory against heavy obstacles, the film is too smart, the people too real, and Hopkins too charming to fall into that trap. The film promotes some very welcome ideas: that the power of our intention can transform our life, that there may be some goodness still left in people, and that old age can be a time of possibility, not a time to throw in the towel. This is a warm, charming, and yes, I'll say the ""s"" word, sentimental film that will not appeal to the action-oriented multiplex crowd or those who find it chic to be cynical, but may appeal to those who simply enjoy well made entertainment that actually delivers on its promise of making us feel good. Kudos to Donaldson, Hopkins, and, of course, to Burt Munro."
"Anthony Hopkins captured the spirit of the great Burt Munroe, as no one else could. Hopkins captured a New Zealand accent, and the mannerism of Burt Munroe the true sign of a great actor. From the interaction with the neighbors to the do it yourself mechanical skill. The life of Burt Munroe and Hopkins portrayal of his trial bodes well to the character and his belief that adversity strengthens. I always enjoy when I watch this movie and chuckle at its moments every time. I must have watched this movie at least once a month since it came out on DVD.If you want a great movie to add to your permanent DVD collection this one is it"
"It seems many viewers avoided this film when it was in the theaters because the title was confusing and not representative of the story. The fact that Sir Anthony Hopkins was the lead actor should have been a signal of sorts, but it took the release of the DVD for this viewer to reluctantly rent the film when other possibilities were low. Big Mistake! This is one of the more genuinely fine films about the idomitability of the human spirit that has been released in some time.Based on a true story, the 'Indian' of the title has nothing to do with the heritage of the character Burt Munro, a 67 year old odd but generously kind New Zealander whose lifelong passion is to race his 1923 'Indian motorbike' in the Bonneville Salt Flats Races in America. Burt lives for his dreams and despite the fact that his idiosyncrasies befuddle his neighbors and townsfolk (with the except of the little boy Tom next door who idolizes him), he manages to make everyone with whom he comes into contact admire, and yes, love him. Using his own skills he brings his old motorbike to the point that he can enter the race in the States and with the financial help of his friends he manages to board a ship with his bike and sail to America. In the US he is a fish out of water and must adjust to the city life and attitudes of the Americans, but eventually, through his innate charm and dedication to his dream, he does manage against all odds and, with the help of many American new friends, enter the race to break the world's record for speed on a motorbike.Hopkins owns the role of Burt and despite his not always on target New Zealand accent he manages to deliver surely one of his most endearing portrayals of his rich career. His encounters with Tom, with a feisty widow Ada (Diane Ladd), with a fine old wise Indian man, and with a transsexual motel clerk Tina (Chris Williams), to name only a few of the superb supporting cast - are the epitome of underplayed fine acting and engender so much warmth that tears of happiness just can't be avoided. Writer and director Roger Donaldson deserves a standing ovation for this small, sensitive, gentle, understated tale that demonstrates so well how being true to your visions and your dreams can overcome almost any obstacle. A deeply touching and completely entertaining movie. Highly Recommended for all audiences. This is one to Buy! Grady Harp"
"Just saw this film and thought it was astoundingly well done. No need to write my thoughts, as many of the positive reviews here have touched on all the aspects that make this a great picture. I'm puzzled why it is in such limited release; here in western Canada, it's on ONE screen in Vancouver, and that's it for the western provinces. Likewise, one screen in Ontario (Toronto). What the hell is wrong with the movie industry that a film like this is sent, virtually, direct to home video. I saw it in a really first rate theater, with great screen and sound, and it would be hard to reproduce the experience on home theater...Go see this movie."
"""Spoiler"" noted only because I may reveal surprises.Unlike some reviewers I AM a motorcycle fan, but that isn't a requirement for the enjoyment of this film. TWFI goes far beyond merely showing the life of a gearhead, with a clear, compassionate display of human dedication and perseverance. The fact that it also manages to show accurately the behavior of a man whose life is centered around machinery is icing on the cake for me. Example: Burt trimming his toenails with a sanding attachment on a drill motor. That is exactly the sort of solution a man like him would've found for a grooming challenge. Example: trimming the weeds in the yard by dousing them with gasoline and lighting them. Again, very true-to-life. The production of the movie also showed a real commitment to accuracy and excellence. According to the review in Motorcycle Consumer News, the junk lying around Burt's shop was the real Burt Munro's actual junk, including melted pistons and blown cylinders ruined during his development of the Indian's engine. Also, even more amazingly, the cars on the salt at Bonneville were not copies, not period-correct restorations, but THE ACTUAL vehicles which were there when Burt Munro ran. How the producers were able to persuade the museums in which those beauties normally reside to allow them to return to the abrasive, corrosive environment of a salt flat is beyond my imagination. I just know that they bring an air of reality to this film which one doesn't see often in modern films. I think that even viewers who couldn't tell a piston from a pinto pony will still feel the reality of the environments shown in this film, will ""get the vibe,"" so to speak. Anthony Hopkins is, as ever, brilliant. There are other actors who could've done a good job of portraying Burt Munro, but there is no one who could have done it better. Actors of his caliber don't go to work with the thought that someone will award them a gold statue for their work, but it will be a shame if he is not nominated for every possible award for this role. TWFI is the kind of subtle, quiet film which sometimes escapes the notice of award-givers; I hope it gets noticed."
"""The World's Fastest Indian"" is based on the true life story of Burt Munro (Anthony Hopkins) a man who is in love with speed. Set in New Zealand during the 1960's this movie follows Burt as he builds and repairs his old 1920's Indian Motorcycle. One day Burt faints and is rushed to the hospital where he is put on pills and is told that he is dying. Burt then follows his dream by going half way across the world to Salt Lake City, Utah to compete in the Bonneville motorcycle competition where he wants to race his Indian motorcycle and break the national land speed record. A real life underdog story ensues¬Ö What a great movie! Is what I said to myself as I walked about of the theater tonight after watching ""The World's Fastest Indian."" This movie is not only about a true underdog but also rather inspiring. This movie reminds people to follow your dreams and always believe in yourself even when majority of people think your going to fail. This movie which is based on true events is a remarkable film about a man who just never stopped no matter what obstacles got in his way. This is a powerful film that we see too few of in my opinion.Anthony Hopkins is just terrific as the good spirited Burt Munro. Anthony Hopkins should have gotten an Oscar Nomination for his performance here. I really think the academy overlooked this film because it was definitely worthy of some attention just for Hopkins performance alone. The whole supporting cast was also great. There are to many smaller roles to name but all did a fine job with the part they were given to play. Great acting jobs all around.This film is director and writer Roger Donaldson's best work to date. He has been doing films for some time now and has directed films like ""Dante's Peak"" and ""The Recruit"" but none have the greatness that this film delivers. The character development and production values are excellent and Donaldson does a great job capturing Burt's happiness and struggles. I think this movie could really make Donaldson a well known director in Hollywood.In conclusion, if you want a movie that is smart and interesting see this film. If you want to see some great performances along with a great screenplay see this film. This movie is truly a great depiction of an ordinary man who does extraordinary things in order to follow his dreams and live life to the fullest. The movie is definitely a feel good movie that will make its audience think and ask question ""When will I follow my dream?"" The performance by Anthony Hopkins is worth the price of admission alone but then when you add on the great screenplay and good supporting roles well you got a film that I feel we see to few of. I highly recommend this movie to those who like well made movies that have substance.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""The World's Fastest Indian"" is a 8/10"
"I can't say when the last time was when I saw a movie and the audience applauded at the end, but it happened 2 days ago when I saw Anthony Hopkins in The Worlds Fastest Indian. This movie does not contain any of the special effects, profanity or nudity that has become too common in movie choices today. What it does contain is superb acting and scenes that make you laugh one minute and get your eyes to well up the next minute.Hopkins delivers a performance that enables the viewer to fully understand what Burt Munroe was doing his entire life, striving to live out a dream. When asked asked if he is afraid of dying on the bike he replies ""I live more in 5 minutes on my motorcycle than many people live in a lifetime"".That is what the movie is all about."
"I went into this film with zero expectations and came out absolutely satisfied. This is Rocky for the aged. It shows us that there is no age limit in following your dreams and it does it with style, grace and flair.Roger Donaldson tells the story without allowing the directorial style to overshadow, what is, an inspiring story of one mans journey to become the fastest man on two, albeit, shaky, wheels.Burt Monro's dogged determination and single minded obsession take him across the globe from Invercargill, New Zealand to Boneville, Utah, USA, where he takes on the clock and himself, but in this story it is not the destination that matters, it's the journey.A first rate film and a tribute to it's star, Director, and above all, Burt Monro."
"While I was aware of the land speed record established by Bert Munro, I was not prepared for his personal Odyssey. His work at Bonneville, as I now realize, stands tall in a world of giants - Vale Bert! This film was a beautifully shot, well directed overview of the man and his eccentric story. The fluffy bits may or may not be accurate to the real story, and I can understand that Scripting People and Directors may require the ""human Interest"" to be ramped up... but in this film it is obvious, and gentle - not exploitative in my opinion. The film moves well, and the treatment of the story is calm and 'small-world' in style. I was delighted; we laughed at some comic moments and we came to understand some of Bert's classically Kiwi personality. Hopkins (and this is not a criticism, just a minor dead note) struggles with his character's accent throughout, but unless one is Kiwi it may not be noticeable. Hopkins wanted this role, and I can see why. Purity of motive, simplicity of character - actors must get tired of working in the neurotic, hyperbolic, sometimes pathetic and finally dishonest world of Hollywood Cinema.... This film goes a different path, and deserves it's audience. Trolls who need ""action"" and cretins who live in the ""American Pie"" world need not apply. This is cinema."
"The rating on here should tell you a lot about whether this is a good movie or not. If you miss it you will regret it.All motorbike fans and fans of any motor sport should love this. Anthony Hopkins' acting range has no bounds, he even surprised me in this little gem.Funny, heartbreaking, a bit rude, riveting, nerve wracking and heartwarming. Ultimately one of the most uplifting movies I have had the pleasure to watch more than once and each time feels like the first time.It really pulls you in and you become invested in the character Anthony Hopkins is portraying. Also loosely based on part of the life of Burt Munro.Highly recommended."
"Despite the title of this film, its hero, Burt Munro, is not an Indian, in either the sense of ""American Indian"" or that of ""native of India"". He is in fact a New Zealander; the title relates to his Indian Scout motorcycle. The story is set in the early 1960s, and Munro is a motorcycle enthusiast from Invercargill, New Zealand. His great ambition is to take part in the Bonneville Speed Week with his almost equally elderly motorbike, which dates back to 1920. He travels by cargo ship to Los Angeles with his beloved bike, then rides it all the way to the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah.Burt Munro was a real person, and seems to have been a rather more serious and dedicated individual than the character portrayed in this film, an elderly eccentric in fading health who is obsessed with motorbikes and whose lifetime ambition is to compete at Bonneville once before he dies. The central part of the film, dealing with his journey from Los Angeles to Utah, takes on something of the character of an epic road-movie as Burt overcomes the many obstacles which stand is his way with the assistance of the colourful characters he meets- a transvestite named Tina, a Native American and a woman named Ada who briefly becomes his lover. When he gets to Bonneville he is barred from competing by race officials, partly because he has not registered for the competition in advance and partly because his ancient bike fails to meet contemporary safety standards. Eventually he is allowed to make a timed run, something presented as an act of compassion towards an old man and his dream. Although there are numerous exceptions, such as his Hannibal Lecter in ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Red Dragon"", many of Anthony Hopkins's best performances have come in films where he has played real historical individuals, such as Dr Treves in ""The Elephant Man"", Captain Bligh in ""The Bounty"", Frank Doel in ""84 Charing Cross Road"", C.S. Lewis in ""Shadowlands"", John Quincy Adams in ""Amistad"" and Alfred Hitchcock in the recent ""Hitchcock"". ""The World's Fastest Indian"" is another to add to this list. The real Munro, in fact, raced at Bonneville on a number of occasions and set numerous land speed records for motorcycles, one of which still stands to this day. It is therefore hard to imagine him being quite as amateurish and ill-prepared as Hopkins's character. And yet Hopkins's interpretation of the role is one of the factors- indeed, possibly the most important factor- which make this film such a success. His Munro is an often-difficult but lovable old man who arouses admiration because of his innocent self-belief, his determination and his refusal to take ""no"" for an answer, especially in his dealings with American bureaucracy. The film was a big success at the New Zealand box-office; Munro is something of a folk hero in his native country, and director Roger Donaldson, himself a New Zealander, had long cherished the ambition of making a film about him. (Donaldson had earlier directed Hopkins in ""The Bounty""). Perhaps the reason for the film's success that it encapsulates the way New Zealanders think about themselves; a small country of only some four million inhabitants, they have nevertheless achieved considerable success in the sporting arena (particularly in rugby union), and this film celebrates another Kiwi underdog taking on a bigger nation at their own game and beating them. 8/10"
"Blue-collared New Zealander Burt Munro has one dream; to go fast. Obsessed with his dream to break land-speed records, Burt wakes up every morning before dawn to customize his 1920 606cc Indian Scout to the dismay of his neighbors. Not getting any younger, Burt decides to follow his dream and endure a long harsh pilgrimage to the Bonneville salt flats of Utah.Based on a true story ""World's Fastest Indian"" has become a labor of love for director Roger Donaldson who had been working on and off on the project for 20 years. Donaldson even directed a TV documentary on the same subject in 1971. His passion for his subject is the engine that drives this beautifully shot film. He seems to have tremendous respect and fondness for the Invercargill legend avoiding simple generalizations.Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Burt Munro is arguably the best performance of his career. Burt comes off as a gruff but good-natured backyard eccentric; a big fish who has gotten too big for his pond and despite setbacks, aims to prove he's anything but ordinary. Burt setbacks however are ordinary in a good sense. Ones that we all have experienced: lack of money, mechanical and transportation issues, entrenched bureaucracy, they're all frustratingly there impeding Burt from succeeding in his goal. Burt however handles them with a dose of chipper can-do helping others along the way including a cynical transvestite (Chris Williams), a struggling used car salesman (Paul Rodriguez) and a lonely widow (Diane Ladd).Ultimately what comes across the screen is a small quiet film about a larger than life figure. Not quite a motorcycle movie or a biographical melodrama, ""World's Fastest Indian"" totes the line being equally satisfying for both motorheads and the average moviegoer.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/"
"An elderly man restores an old motor - cycle and takes it halfway round the world to ride it on Bonneville Salt Flats. This is the story of an obsession eventually realised by 63 year - old heart patient Burt Munro.Stubborn,ornery,bloody - minded,call him what you will,he was a man of no small courage,fully aware of the risks involved in pushing himself and his machine to the limit. He makes an epic journey across America towing his ""Indian"" behind a clapped - out old clunker,encountering a full and varied selection of the population en route,giving them the benefit of his wisdom whether they want it or not. From black ladyboy(there couldn't have been many of them to the pound in 1962 even in Hollywood) to Native American to lonely widow to hitch - hiking serviceman on leave from Vietnam,Burt gets to meet a suspiciously ""Cross Section of America"" cornucopia of citizens of this strange land. Gruff but kindly,he's not too happy at being mistaken for a Brit,but New Zealanders were rare visitors to the U.S. back in those days. In fact the inference is many Americans had never heard of it. As Munro,Mr Anthony Hopkins gives a performance of quiet charm with reserves of strength that are brought to the fore just when required. It is a complete contrast to some of his flashy scenery - chewing roles that have bought him the time to appear in movies like ""The World's fastest Indian""which seem to have little general appeal. Not a financial success,it is well worth seeking out and a worthy introduction to N.Z. Cinema to a wider public."
"A charming but perhaps a bit too long road picture, The World's Fastest Indian tells the true story of Burt Munro (Anthony Hopkins), a New Zealand man who spent 25 years dreaming of a chance to go faster than any man ever had. He wants to take his 1920 Indian Scout motorcycle and race it during Speed Week at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah and he's not going to let being 30 years older than every other racer there or living on the New Zealand equivalent of Social Security stop him.Munro is what you could call an old duffer. He doesn't have a house but sleeps on a cot in a tool shed. He never mows his lawn, gets fresh eggs from his chicken coop and pees on his lemon tree every morning. Everybody in his small home town likes him, especially the boy who lives next door and hangs around as Burt constantly works on his cycle. The 1960s New Zealand of Burt Munro is very much like we used to think of small town Iowa before it started to die out, a nice place of nice people who are nice to each other. The town even tries to raise money to help Burt afford his trip to America, but he eventually has to mortgage his property to pay for it.Once in the U.S., Burt has to make his way from the California coast to Utah. His travels lead him to meet a transvestite hotel clerk, a Mexican used car salesmen, an Indian who helps him after he breaks down on the side of the road and a woman who gives him her bed to sleep in. And while Burt is a kind and decent fellow, you can sense that people respond to him because of his quiet sense of purpose.Like all great quests, there are obstacles in his way. Accidents and regulations and police officers and a bit of a heart condition. No problem is ever too terrible or too threatening, though. And unlike many movie quests, but just like most real life journeys, Burt doesn't get through it on his own. Without the help and goodwill of the people he meets, Burt would never get a chance to see just how fast his old motorcycle could go.This is a charming and decidedly uncynical film, highlighted by Hopkins' performance. This isn't the sort of character most would associate him with. Burt Munro is a simple and earthy man whose life is enveloped by his desire for speed. As a young man, he might have been a bit difficult to deal with but age has tempered him and stripped him of the ego that might have sharpened his eccentricities to an edge. His desire to race isn't a compulsion. It's a spot on the horizon he'd just like to reach.Normally, The World's Fastest Indian would be considered a family film. And, outside of Burt getting lucky a couple of times, it fits into that category¬Öso, depending on your attitude toward septuagenarian promiscuity, this might be a wonderful movie for parents and kids to watch together. This is a pleasant story that believes people are basically good and that success is achieved through the consideration of others. There are certainly worse ways to spend a couple of hours."
"The usual pattern of online reviews is followed here it seems. First we get a flush of people who love the film and then a few who don't and seem to delight in telling us. Some of the more recent poor reviews leave me a little confused ‚Äì can you really be that impervious to a good film, or perhaps you think yourself more sophisticated than the rest of us for making disparaging remarks of that which others enjoy? The film is a delight and works on many levels. The acting and story are superb and it deserves those first gushing reviews. It receives criticism for being slow, it isn't, its subtle, there is a big difference. Also - guys, it is based on a true story, so criticising it for the turn of events depicted is pointless. I only got round to watching it very recently, hoping it would be an antidote from the crash and burn pyrotechnic antics of mainstream Hollywood. It is much more than that. I love Burt, you can't help but love Burt."
"Really good movie, showing man dedication and belief to do something he likes and knows he is good at it. On the side track of the movie is shown the main character nature, character, without big words, but still we see his strong personality, easy - naive thinking and getting along with all people he met on his way. You can't not love him, even if at the beginning you think that he might be old, senile, crazy guy with crazy idea. But this changes when you get to know him.The movie is so strong, that I wanted to go in garage and built a racing machine and go in desert to test it, just for my spirit...:-) Must see movie!"
"This movie seems, at first glance, to be over the top. In truth the real story of Burt Munro is actually just as fantastic as this movie. Burt was, to say the least, an eccentric from the starting line. The fact that this man was most likely a genius in the field of motorcycle design is always over looked. In most things I've read about Burt he's given an almost ""idiot-savant"" portrayal. But Sir Anthony Hopkins portrays both Burt's eccentric nature,determination and genius with equal skill. I wasn't expecting to enjoy this movie as much as I did but it was worth my time. The story of Burt Munro and his Indian is a love story of unusual dimensions as it is the story of a mans love for a dream and his determination to achieve it. Hopkins gives Burt a infectious charm that lures all around him into sharing his dream. while I cannot say that Burt was like this in real life. If you enjoy movies where the little guy is up against insurmountable odds and finds the guts to succeed then watch this movie!"
"An outstanding 10... Now,this movie is gonna stay in my list of favorites as NUMERO UNO...! Ever wanted to watch a movie which could elevate your spirits,better your perspective towards life,which could make u sit like a crack with your mouth open and smiling???!,or do u just want to witness sheer acting talent Hollywood hasn't seen for years.. Witness all in the ""World's fastest Indian""...!!! Anthony Hopkins stars as Burt Munro...an ""Indian"" type motorcyclist from New Zealand when such motorcyclists are extinct...Burt is aging in his own way and has a neighbor's kid as the sole companion who gives him company while he prepares his Indian for an annual winter race in the salt lake in America..The story is then how he gets enough funds to get to America and set a record with his Indian..There is also health concerns as Burt is an aging person and needs to take in pills to move on..But none of this concerns are gonna deter his strong determination,but will a strong will alone make up to success..?? Check out this wonderful movie...u will just love it if u r a true cinemaholic..and u will become one too if u r not..!!! Long live sir Anthony Hopkins..!!!"
"Anthony Hopkins is the perfect choice for this role. this film have the perfect ending. My eyes get fulled many times but when they became free there would be a gag and It was stopped it. There are perfect collaboration between dram and comedy. thanks for this working. I will more appreciate to my life and I will be more understanding against older people.I want to see more, Anthony Hopkins in the movies. He is a legend. We should appreciate himhe was in action films when he is younger but now he is in emotional film. I couldn't think that he will take role in like this film."
"This is a film that not a lot of people will see but those who have will be all the better for it.Anthony Hopkins delivers an outstanding performance in a touching and funny film that engages the heart and enriches the soul.Hopkins performance is central to the enjoyment of the film,his character is wonderfully naive,his dogged determination and vision to achieve his goal is truly inspirational.I challenge anyone to not get sucked into his performance and root for his character in much the same way we all rooted for Rocky in 1975 when everyone was against him.The films title wont grab anyones attention, there's no digital effects and no all star cast but with a story as good as this you just don't need the distraction of star names.This is the most unexpected fun I've had watching a film in a long long time.I would urge anyone who is feeling a bit down to give this film a chance as it is a life affirming piece that will have you feeling good and bring a smile to your face. Beautiful film full of heart.10/10"
"The world's fastest Indian is simple enough to sum up never give up on your dreams. Even if there is road blocks put in your path. Anthony Hopkins delivers perhaps one of his best acting roles in years and he shows his amazing talent in portraying Burt Munro a man with a dream and a vision to match. His dream is to race his 1924 Harley Davidson Indian motorcycle at the Bonneville salt flats or as he puts it it's sacred ground, hallow ground. Perhaps no one understands this better then Roger Donaldson who also had a dream and a vision in bringing Munro's story to the screen and in doing so brought to life one of the most inspiration movies I have ever seen. The talent behind this movie was white hot and it hit each and every button they were aiming for. Was it worth watching Yes. Will this movie stay with you long after you see it yes. This movie is as the tagline states is based on one hell of a story and it is true. Burt Munro should be remembered thanks to this movie and the amazing job done by Anthony Hopkins."
"Hopkins is outstanding in this true-life tale of Kiwi Bill Munro who sets out to break the land speed record in the twilight of his life. That Bill Munro's tale was little known outside his native Invercargill is a tragedy for the man but a boon for film-goers, keeping the dramatic tension at a peak throughout. Will he make it to Speed Week? Will he be allowed to race? Will his heart hold out? Will he survive? The film is upbeat and feel-good without ever being sentimental or manipulative. Cynics will say Munro comes over as Forrest Gump meets Crocodile Dundee, that the plot is cookie-cutter from Straight Story or Broken Flowers. Ignore them, these people are doomed to unhappiness. Supported by a host of on-form character actors, Hopkins gives a lifetime best performance in a film that is inspirational in both film-making and life-affirming terms. Budding actors should study the scenes where Hopkins talks about the early demise of his twin brother, and what it means to him to finally see the salt flats. You will come away from this film feeling joyous."
"Its taken me a while to finally watch this movie. Unfortunately it did not interest me initially and no-one really recommended it to me. As I normally do, I did my weekly search at my local video store to try and find a bargain in the ex-rental bin when I came across this movie. Thank goodness I bought it. Its one of the most uplifting, funniest and entertaining movies I have ever seen. Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as Burt Munro, a man chasing a dream and not letting anything get in the way. Burt is one of the most honest and genuine human beings you would ever come across and this seems to always get him over the line as he travels towards his objective of testing his Indian motorcycle on the famous Boneville salt flats. The way he gets to his destination is nothing short of astounding, and very believable. When he gets there he must fight another battle and again his honest nature triumphs over everything that is thrown at him.I really loved this Movie and would recommend it to anyone. It makes you laugh and cry at the same time and leaves you wanting to recommend it to all your friends.Its a great Movie and Anthony Hopkins was made for the role.I'm sure that if you reading this you have most likely seen the Movie. If you have not, do yourself a favor, and if you can watch it with someone, so that you can share the ride."
"That's the kind of movie I love because it's simply refreshing . It's not the story about a hero , it's the story about a real man with a quite interesting dream . No bad guys , no politicians , only average people around him ,just amazed and moved by the quest of this man .. While we are overwhelmed by violence , stupidity , lies , politics and money in the movies business , sometimes a movie like that one can help us to ask for something else , something different . At last a movie without thousands of dead , weapons ,cops , blood , hero with a Q.I. of 80 something ..... Is that the proof that anybody can do it ? Like the Australian Dream ? I don't know but here is a very interesting French quote:"" Help yourself and God will help you !"" Thank you , my wife and I just loved the movie !Phil"
"No Film Is Greater than this. One of the most captivating humorous & adventurous films New Zealand has ever produced. I did not expect this film to be as good. I got it out on DVD, and I'm rapt I did. Anthony Hopkins is a marvellous Burt Munro and the guest role from Invercargill Mayor Tim Shadbolt was a beauty. It was a very easy plot to follow and Legendary director Roger Donaldson sure knows how to do it. As i live in Southland, where it was sort-of filmed, I say you're not a southlander unless you've watched this. So if you live in Southland, watch it! You'll definitely regret it if you don't. This film has given Invercargill a great name...""Where dreams are possible"". If so,more than 10/10!!!"
"I really enjoyed this movie. When I saw the title I had no idea what to expect, and I was watching it late at night, thinking of maybe falling asleep - but the movie didn't give me the slightest chance! I spent a year in New Zealand so I loved the character straight from the start. This movie kept me in constant suspense, hoping that Burt would make his goal.Anthony Hopkins was great as Burt, Id say that he was at his best! The movie is a great flick, no blood needed to keep your eyes on the screen enjoying one heck of a ride!! If you like cars or motorcycles this movie is a must. 10/10"
"I know Burt's family has stopped by here from time to time. I wanted to thank them.My daughter was born shortly after my father died. She'll know him only though photos, a couple of videos, and our stories of him. But one day we'll show her ""Indian"" and she'll know his spirit. He built his own airplane, and late in life he made the pilgrimage to Oshkosh. Whittman Airfield in Wisconsin was his Cathedral. But the salt flats were holy, too. http://tinyurl.com/yg2p44 So thank you.And Mr. Hopkins absolutely deserved the Oscar."
"Anthony Hopkins deserves an Oscar for this role. I'm Australian (Westminster-born), and I love my Kiwi cousins, and I'm a motorcyclist. This film is not simply a chronical of one of the world's forgotten characters, but a story of passion and dedication.It is inspirational, and Mr. Hopkins positively shines in his interpretation of this man.The story starts in the 1950's (or before) and immediately fascinates with an urban portrait of a dedicatated, mechanically-minded, and very average grandfatherly single chap whose one ambition is to make his Indian motorcycle go faster. He is occasionally the subject of ridicule and pity in his home town, but he is never fazed.I can say no more other than 'see this film'. The producer and director (Roger Donaldson) and editor have all done magnificent work. Don't miss it if you're a serious film (and/or motorcycle) buff. Fabulous."
"The Worlds Fastest Indian is probably the best feel good movie i have ever seen. I truly believe it is one of the best independent films of the last ten years.What TWFI real appeal is that it is not really a story about a motorbike rider at all. I mean sure, dumb petrol heads (including my ex-flatmate) will probably love this movie, for its exciting scenes where Bert breaks the world record. But really, the actual breaking of the record itself is only a small part of the movies appeal.What is much more presence are the common themes of triumph over adversity, of the underdog winning out, of a man from a small country, (The mighty NZ) coming to the 'big smoke' to make his fortune and succeding. Indeed this story has some relevance to New Zealands proud sporting history, as while Munro was breaking this record, athletes such as Peter Snell, Murray Halberg, Bill Baillie and of course the great Colin Meads were firmly establishing New Zealand as a strong sporting nation.The humour in this film is a pleasant surprise. All of the jokes contain an element of wit to them, unlike so many other films that come these days (hollowood obvisouly0. Although i like the American Pie films, they kick-started a host of toilet-humour movies which have become tiresome and unfunny. But this film has clever humour to go with a simply, yet effective plot. The 'lemon-tree' running joke is particularly humorous.The accurate portray of New Zealand in the 1960s is very evident, and the community spirit of the town in getting behind Bert is also brilliantly scripted. I also enjoyed the different people that Bert met whilst in American, particularly Native American Jake and the transsexual. The fact that Bert does not judge these people on their appearance alone is very enduring ( although I would have to say this has changed somewhat in New Zealand now days.) In the 1960s, New Zealand was naive to the world in many ways. Nowdays, we are one of the worlds most travelled people due to our isolation and rebellion nature. People like Bert and Peter Snell were pioneers of the travel bug for the average new Zealander.As for the acting, Hopkins was magnificent. he should have gotta an Oscar nomination. if Keisha ""I'm pregnant at 16"" Castle-Hughes can get one for Whale Rider, then Hopkins was clearly robbed, and it is only his previous success that denied him a nomination in my opinion. Hopkins is able to nail the difficulty Invercargill accent ( the only real provincial different in accents in New Zealand) superbly. He really makes this film what it is. Jim ( Berts fellow competitor in Utah)also puts in a quality performance, as do the girls who support Bert. Finally, the little boy whose name i have forgotten really adds well to the cast, bringing back childhood memories for everyone i am sure.Overall I Cant say enough good things about this film. Im hopelessly biased, but if you are an American or European out there who doesn't rate New Zealand films, i would honestly recommend this one. It will have you feeling happy the entire movie and will confirm your faith in the kind spirit of the human race."
"Is it really necessary to write a review for a movie in which Anthony Hopkins stars? He has played a dominant part in many magnificent movies like Silence Of The Lambs, Hannibal, Instinct, The Edge, etc.An actor like Sir Anthony Hopkins can break or make a movie. In this one, I really believe him to be the adventurous Burt Munro. In this movie he has this funny accent and he meets a lot of exceptional people. Like Tony already mentioned this movie lacks any special effects. But when Mr. Hopkins is performing at his best, there is absolutely no need for expensive, special effects.Take a nice bottle of red wine or a glass of whisky and a cigar and enjoy this movie. It really is one of the best movies that has been released this year."
"This film is presented as a quiet adventure really. Monroe's character has excellent dialogue. The whole film is really crafted well, and engulfs you leaving you fully entertained by a great story. Anthony Hopkins presents his character brilliantly with his usual skill. His character is of one of those rare people who touch other lives in a way that seems to be a thing of the past in the film industry. The scenes on the salt lake flats are well done, and look credible. Not sure how they managed to do that, but that is Hollywood. Well done script writers. I would recommend that you go and see this film, or at least rent it."
"One of the best movies I have seen in a long time, ""Worlds Fastest Indian"" is enthralling from the beginning to the final second. Anthony Hopkins does a brilliant job of portraying Burt Munro, a world motorcycle speed record holder, and someone most people have never heard of.He brilliantly reminds me of all of the older grey haired ""tinkerers"" who built racing cars and bikes in Australia and New Zealand in the ""old days"" who had no other means of achieving their goals other than to make it happen themselves, and who would stop at nothing to realise those dreams.I could not fault the movie, the photography was sensational, the acting was brilliant, the story was inspiring. The only criticism of the movie as such was the marketing of it, a lot of people would not bother to go because they would think its a movie about racing motorcycles, which it isn't. I only went after checking out the movie's web site, otherwise I may not have bothered. I suspect it will be a big hit on DVD as a lot of people who missed it at the theatre will want to check it out. Hopkins should get an Acadamy Award for this one......"
"Take 1 part Crocadile Dundee, 2 parts Oscar Madison, 1 part McGuiver and you have the raunchy old biker character Hopkins created to approximate Burt Munro...a 68 year old pensioner from Kiwi land that set the world speed record in the 1000cc motorcycle class.Burt Munro lives in his garage, fills his tea pot with quench water from his forge and urinates on his lemon trees ( best fertilizer you can give 'em)...but the ladies seem to take to his free and easy life style and Hopkins/Burt seems to have no effort charming bunk mates....he even charms the cross dressing desk clerk at his Hollywood motel.Much of the movie is spent with Hopkins developing and personifying Burt's character and playing his rustic stoicism and mellow temperament against life's hard knocks, modern times and some pretty bizarre Hollywood denizens and the pursuit of his dreams of speed....and this works because you are kept enthralled with his hapless journey to the ""holy ground""...the salt flats of Bonneville not realizing 2 hrs have shot by.The final stages of the movie involve Burt's endearing himself to the""kids"" competing for the Bonneville speed crown and having the rules bent so he can make his famous run on the flats.If you ride motorcycles and don't usually like motorcycle movies ( like me), this one is for you....actually this is a great old fashioned success-against-all-odds movie that entertains, makes you laugh and also reflect. Hopkins shines in characterizing the resilient grease monkey Burt Munro and there is enough action, comedy and pathos to keep a broad audience absorbed in Burt's quest.Probably the most enjoyable movie I saw this year. Donaldson has a sleeper on his hands with this fine effort. You can tell that the director had a passion for telling Burt's tale. It comes through strong in the small details that make this movie so believable and the characters so real. Too bad it was so poorly promoted. I don't understand how such a great film got 3rd rate distribution and promotion...methinks some politics are at work...shame, everyone should see this one it's a classic."
"I was only partially looking forward to this movie. I thought it would be mostly about motorcycle racing and his various attempts at breaking the land speed record but I love Anthony Hopkins and my husband was really looking forward to it so off we went. Boy was I pleasantly surprised. What a wonderful story. I was so glad that a big part of the movie was his journey and the characters he met. The scenes that involved the racing were equally as entertaining. He was such a likable person and so entertaining. I was never bored during this movie and found myself wanting more when it ended. I, too, believe Anthony Hopkins should be nominated for an Oscar. I will buy this movie when it comes out on DVD."
"This movie is one of the best 'feel good movies' I've seen in a long time, yet it is almost impossible to find playing anywhere, and that pisses me off! They ran a trailer for it during the SuperBowl which is not cheap, but only released it in just a little over 100 screens across the country! What is wrong with these people? I know a lot of people who want to see it, but are having the same problem as everyone else. I called my folks who live near Sacremento, Ca., and they haven't been able to find it anywhere close to them. I've seen it twice and know they would love it, and want them to see it, but with the pathetic distribution, that looks doubtful until it comes out on DVD. I realize the studio or movie may not have a 'King Kong' budget, but why would you spend $25 million on a movie and then only put in out in such tiny quantity?"
"I just saw this movie earlier this evening and have to say I enjoyed it. The parking lot at the theater was quite crowded for a Sunday matin√©e, and I joked that all the bikers in town must have come out...then, once inside, I ran into one of the local Harley-Davidson shop owners! Turns out I was right!Anyway, the story told in the movie is inspirational and heartwarming, though formulaic and rife with factual inaccuracies. For instance, the movie depicts a number of incidents taking place on Munro's first trip to America, when in actuality they happened on subsequent trips. In the film, Munro speaks of a twin brother killed in an accident; the real Munro's twin was a sister who died at birth.None of this, in the end, takes anything away from the very real accomplishments of the very real Burt Munro.The cinematography throughout was beautiful, saturated with the colors of the 1960s. The scenes of ""Speed Week"" at Bonneville Salt Flats were particularly lovely. Hot rod nerds will drool themselves dry watching the classic iron roll by in these shots. The costumes are spot-on for the era, too.I found the percussive, repetitive music score a bit distracting, personally. It sounded like the score for ""American Beauty: Down Under"" (the production was based in New Zealand, so maybe that's where the flavor came from). I got used to it, though.Anthony Hopkins is really great in this role. He reminded me of a few old grease-stained geezers that have crossed my own path over the years. This role is diametrically opposed to characters like Hannibal Lecter and Richard Nixon, and it really gives Hopkins a chance to step into a benign skin and own it. He was totally believable, even when the forced dramatic license of the film was not.This is the type of flick that might well appeal to both men and women; it's got an iron-balled hero on a motorcycle, but it's also a testament to the indomitable human spirit. I saw it on a date, and we both had a swell time.Just my $.02."
"In 'The World's Fastest Indian' Anthony Hopkins plays Burt Munro, a retired motorcycle enthusiast from New Zealand who dreams of becoming the fastest man alive. He wants to go the Bonneville Salt Flats and see how fast his bike will really go. When he finds out he has a heart condition, he becomes more determined to fulfill his dream before it is too late.This is probably the best movie I have seen thus far this year. Sir Anthony Hopkins make this movie believable and worth watching. Along with Hopkins performance, the movie itself is very authentic. A complete replica of Munro's bike was built and used in the film. Also, many of the props used belonged to Munro including some of Hopkins' wardrobe. I would compare it to 'The Right Stuff' meets 'Hidalgo'.If this movie had not opened so early in the year, I would think it would be an Oscar contender. I will keep my fingers crossed."
"This was a great ""feel good"" movie, which I haven't seen in a long time. Mr. Hopkins is obviously proud of this movie and should be - it was a very fun night. His love of the character that Bert Monro truly was, is captured in this movie. It makes me want to know more about this man from New Zealand. You couldn't help but pull for this character. Bert had such a positive view of life that is lost in this age. It was very refreshing to see something original in amongst so many remakes and sequels. Hopkins should have been in the Oscar nominations, but I don't understand why this reached the Oscar voting window so late. I would think that the release of a movie revolves around what an Oscar nomination can do for profits."
"I loved this movie. It was wonderfully filmed and the story kept me entranced from beginning to end. The storyline at first appears quirky and in some respects the movie seems to be much ado about nothing. After thinking about the movie after viewing, the enormity of what Burt Munroe achieved sinks it. This is a story of a dream, of determination, of vision and of the human spirit. Anthony Hopkins was superb, I don't think many actors could of pulled it off like he did. One of my favorite films in the last 12 months. MAKE SURE YOU SEE THIS MOVIE if you want something different from Hollywoods blood and guts routine, it a delight."
"This is much more than a bike film. Its about a guys journey to achieve something, basically leaving ones mark on this planet. An entertaining film with humor and a lot of detail in terms of the original setting worked through. Which as an ex neighbor of the old codger received some scrutiny. There is much more to Burts life than shown on the film but the essence is there and a flavor of the guys skill is seen in the casting of his own pistons. The film crafts in nicely the guys passion and determination which is what the films about. As a consequence the film is very appealing to a wide audience. My 90 year old aunt was rapt with it... as well as the grand children. The film stays away from sleaze and smut and excessive stunts. The fact is Burt had many pile ups in his life and there could have been a number shown, but that wasn't the main story. The film is a story of working towards ones goals and ultimately achieving them. This journey should be appealing to all ages because we all need goals in our own lives. I would highly recommend it as being suitable family viewing."
"In all respects this is a wonderful film. The story is great, the acting is great its hard to pick faults.The main character played by Anthony Hopkins overcomes many obstacles on his way to breaking the world land speed record. The way he overcomes these problems is often amusing as much as it is uplifting.The first part of the movie is set in Invercargill New Zealand but the majority of the film is shot in Los Angeles and Utah.Its probably one of the few films which feels as though it finished too soon.Go and see ""World's Fastest Indian"" Satisfaction guaranteed"
I've seen this movie once - and I definitely plan to see it again and again and again. It is just a brilliant movie about how an ordinary guy lived his dreams and made them real. Burt is SO passionate about what he is doing and not letting anything stop him. I came out of the movie feeling that I could put an equivalent amount of energy into the things that I am passionate about that I too could achieve my dreams! It is the ultimate feel good movie AND it is based on a true story! A number of liberties may have been taken with timing of some of the events and some of the characters along the way - but from all accounts it is a fairly good representation of Burt Munro. You don't have to be a petrol-head or into motorbikes to enjoy this movie - my eleven year old niece and my 73 year old mother enjoyed it equally as much!
"I went to see this movie not only with someone who knew Burt's family but whose mother also used to ride an Indian! Burt rode an Indian Scout, she rode and Indian Chief bike and never aspired to break records but we had some expectations (and criticism at the ready) when we walked into the cinema, not least of which was 'why didn't they pick a Kiwi actor for this role?'We walked out having seen a slice of life as we knew it and with cheers on our lips for a good old Kiwi bloke who loved speed, loved the ladies and showed what it was like to dream dreams.We wondered how Anthony Hopkins would tackle the difficult Kiwi accent, most actors end up sounding like Aussies, which is a totally different accent but he managed it just fine, even with a slight Scottish burr which many Southlanders have.He's an absolute master, an expert in his field - as Burt was in his and Mr Hopkins' understated rendition (how did he know we Kiwi's are so laid back about our achievements?) was first class, so we felt the casting director was justified after all!In spite of what the world believes, WE Kiwis were the first to fly more than 1km - Richard Pearse flew almost a year before the Wright Bross. WE split the atom and we've been first past the post in many other technological and scientific achievements...we just don't crow about it and this film exactly captured the way someone like Burt Munro broke records which haven't been bettered 40 years on and yet is relatively unknown, even in Aotearoa. (Incidentally, Hopkins/Burt said 'Aotearoa' wrong in the movie, but many New Zealanders do that anyway so it was probably an accurate mistake!)Not only did Anthony Hopkins do a darned good job for us in portraying an innovative Kiwi, he captured the spirit as well.A wonderful movie, inspiration and superbly low-key."
"www.kajatm.com Finally after consecutive week of seeing Good Night and Good Luck and Firewall and I got to see a movie that was worth the admission. A movie that had a good story line. A movie that had good acting. And a movie that I would recommend to anyone of any age. Unlike Katie Holmes' parents, this movie did not disappoint me.The World's Fastest Indian is based on the true story of Burt Munro (Anthony Hopkins), a guy from New Zealand that is obsessed with getting to the United States so he can drive his custom made Indian Motor cycle on the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah. The movie really focuses on the adversity Burt Munro had to overcome to get to the US to achieve his dream. Anthony Hopkins is excellent, like usual, in the lead role of Burt Munro and really demonstrates how Munro was an individual from a generation that was kind and courteous, a generation that was considerate of others and a generations that knew if you treated people with respect that you'd get a lot farther than being a prick. People of today can learn a lot from Burt Munro.It is going to be a sad day when Anthony Hopkins dies and can no longer bring us great performances like this one. He has been good for so long that I think we often take his acting ability for granted. He does such a great job of portraying Munro that you eventually forget that you are watching Anthony Hopkins on screen and you start to believe that you are watching the true life story of Munro. Anthony Hopkins is what every actor in Hollywood should try to strive for with their career. He doesn't play himself; he plays an accurate representation of the characters that are put before him unlike some actors in Hollywood, Harrison Ford I am looking in your direction.I really cannot say enough about this movie. It gives me faith in Hollywood that there are still directors out there that can make movies that are original, that have good acting and actually have a storyline that you give two shits about. As far as I am concerned directors like Roger Donaldson and Jerry Bruckheimer can keep making movies that are based on true stories because they are far more interesting than the ""Blockbusters"" that get put out every year. The fact that the World Fastest Indian hasn't gotten a lot of hubbub in advertisements or that it isn't playing at some of the biggest theaters in South Eastern Wisconsin speaks volumes of how the movie viewing public has been brainwashed into thinking what should be a good movie.At this point of the year, The World's Fastest Indian is my pick for Picture of the Year. I know it is a little early but I have confidence that this movie will survive until the next nominations. I will be very surprised if Anthony Hopkins doesn't get nominated for Best Actor and wins that category but then again I am never surprised what the ""Academy"" does anymore. This movie doesn't have political undertones, it doesn't have two dudes humping each other on screen and it doesn't have some unbelievable thing that happens on screen that only a computer could generate. So maybe I should retract my previous statement that this is going to be nominated for picture of the year because it doesn't fall under the Academy's new definition of what a best picture should be.Overall this was a very good viewing experience for me. If you have the opportunity and if you can find it playing at a theater near you I would recommend taking the time to see this cinematic master piece. But then again, what do I know?"
