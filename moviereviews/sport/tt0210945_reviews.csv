"How great was this movie? I fell in love with it from being made to watch it in Health class in 11th grade. I love films about adversity within races, and this movie was a classic. Herman Boone has to bring blacks and whites together for a highschool football team to play with each other. Of course, it's the 70's and racism is still rampant. I love the message that people will mesh anyway despite outside complications. Julius' and Gerry's relationship was really profound and special. It crossed a lot of lines. Denzel was remarkable as Coach Boone. He took no crap, yet was scared to lose his position underneath. There was tension everywhere and it worked for the film. The players were really memorable to me. Blue, Rev, Sunshine, Petey, and Louie Lastik were adorable and hilarious. A great ensemble cast effort. The guy who played Yoast was good as well, because he had to learn to overcome prejudices he had that he never knew he did. Even better, was the fact that it's a true story which makes it all the more sweet. I watch this movie over and over and can practically say every line by heart. Great, great film. The Titans really were greater than the gods of Greek myth, and these guys were greater than any stereotype."
"By looking at REMEMBER THE TITANS you are probably saying ""oh geeze, another football movie.  How can this one be any better than the last one?  The only good recent football film is RUDY.""  Well, after seeing this film, you'll be taken by surprise, just like I was.In 1971, in Alexandria, Virginia, the town's high school football team, the T.C. Williams Titans, are very popular.  T.C. Williams High School current football coach, Coach Yoast (Will Patton), is nominated for high school Hall of Fame.  But a few weeks before the start of the school year, a white store owner shoots and kills a black man who was suspected in stealing a product.  This causes a racial seperation between blacks and whites in Alexandria.  Then just before the start of the football season, Coach Yoast gets demoted to Assistant Coach in place of Coach Boone (Denzel Washington). What's bad is that Boone is black, and Yoast is white.  Most of the town's residents are angry, and even some of the players are willing to ruin their football career's to quit the team to make a statement.  But at the start of football camp, Coach Boone won't take any racial diversity.  Boone treats all of his players equally, he has his football camp practices appear to be a mixture between boot camp and group sessions.  If the player misses catching a football, he has to run a mile.  If the player doesn't know anything about the person of the opposite color that they are rooming with, they have homework to get to know one another.  With this, it creates a special bond between these men.  Men who act more mature and humane, unlike most of the residents of Alexandria.  But when Coach Boone and Coach Yoast prove that the Titans are a winning team, the issue of race is erased and the true meaning of teamwork is born.The way to make a great sports movie is to have it be adapted from a true life story.  Like PRIDE OF THE YANKEES, HOOSIERS, and RUDY, all are films that show that what appears to be a sport, is the true triumph of the human spirit.  I really did enjoy the characters in the film, since they are factual, they have very humanistic qualities.  While one loves to hum ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough,"" another gets excited while listening to ""Act Naturally.""  And although you can guess what happens in the end, you don't care.  You enjoy and like the character's so much that you are cheering for them.I highly enjoyed the acting in this film.  I think if Denzel Washington should get his long overdue Oscar for Best Actor, it should be for this film.  He teaches his team that black or white, these men are a team, and that the only way to win is teamwork.  Washington gives a bravura performance, that it will stun the people who think that Washington usually plays ""racist"" roles.  I also enjoyed Will Patton a lot, he's not playing the cliche coach who gets demoted, and wants to ruin the new head coach. Instead, he understands the message that Boone is giving to the team that he helps as much as he can to help the team succeed.  I thought Patton's role is the best assistant coach role that I have seen since Dennis Hopper's role in HOOSERS.  And the football players are also great, the ones I thought stood out were:  Preston Brant (Jerry Buck, the team's captain), Donald Adensun (Petey, the team's running-back), Kip Perdue (Sunshine, the team's quarterback), Craig Kirkwood (Rev, the team's defense player), and Ethan Suplee (Lastik, the team's leading defense, and by his size, he should be!)  I was glad to see Suplee change his roles in his career.  The last time I remember seeing him, he was the vicious skinhead along with Edward Norton and Patrick Furlong in AMERICAN HISTORY X.  In REMEMBER THE TITANS, he's the exact opposite, he's the first white player who makes friends with the black players!!!Director Boaz Yakin and producer Jerry Bruckheimer should be commended for this film.I am pleased to see Jerry Bruckheimer made a really enjoyable and intellectual film, which is the complete opposite of the type of films that he's famous for.  In fact I think this is the first one intellectual film Bruckheimer has made! The message that it sends out is really powerful, and if it doesn't convince you to change, then you are probably dead.  And director Boaz Yakin does a fantastic job with this film, that along with Cameron Crowe, Wolfgang Petersen, and Ridley Scott, he should be nominated best director.This is quite a film, in fact, I think this is the best football movie that I have ever seen!  I really really enjoyed this film, and as I left it led me to believe in the message that this film was sending to it's audience. And this being only ""PG"" and put out by Walt Disney Pictures, I would love to see both junior high schools and high schools to show this film to it's students.  If they did, then chances are, the violence in schools will go down.  And it took Jerry Bruckheimer, Boaz Yakin, and Walt Disney Pictures to do it.  Great job guys!  Don't miss this enjoyable film! ***** (out of five)"
"Remember the Titans is much more than a story about a high school football team. It is a true story about two men who overcome their differences and help an entire town deal with frustration, anger, and mistrust. Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) is the head coach of the football team at the black high school while Bill Yoast (Will Patton) is the head coach of the football team at the white high school. In 1971 the high schools are integrated and Coach Boone is chosen to become the head coach of the football team while Coach Yoast is demoted to assistant coach.Remember the Titans is a powerful film with incredible performances by both Denzel Washington and Will Patton."
"""Remember The Titans"" is one of the two best films to have a chance to win an oscar for best picture.Denzel Washington leads a cast that is young, fresh, talented and determined to make this movie a success. ""Remember The Titans"" is laced with strong performances from Will Patton, Ryan Hurst, Wood Harris, Donald Faison and Greg Alan Williams.Based on a true story ""Remember The Titans"" follows the 1971 T.C. Williams High School Titans football team and their struggles with integration. Washington is Herman Boone, who has run up against racism after he has been brought in to coach the Titans. Patton is Bill Yoast, the man Boone replaced as head coach. Washington and Patton are just two pieces of the puzzle, which makes ""Remember The Titans"" a real gem. However, the strength and real beauty of ""Remember The Titans"" does not come from Washington or Patton, but the Titan football players because they are the ones who give the strongest performances in the film.I must say that the best performance of the whole movie other than Washington and Patton is the young actress who portrayed Bill Yoast's daughter, Hayden Panitierre. In ""Remember The Titans"" this young actress single handidly made it worth watching this film. Her talent shines through and her presence on screen is as fresh as the daily air; furthermore, every time she is on screen she sparkles. It is so pleasurable to see talent like this being discovered.I hesitated to see ""Remember The Titans"" because I didn't want to see another football film, but it is more than just another football film.
""Remember The Titans"" is a special film that has special performances and is well worth every dollar you spend to rent this film."
"If their is ever a film to watch to get motivated, it's this. You don't have to be an American football lover, just any sport, or activity. The passion displayed on the screen could get Sven Goran Eriksson in the mood. Their are particular inaccuracies in order to make this into more of a film, but I wouldn't call it predictable. This is based on a true story, and the 13 and 0 record really happened, so this true story was what created the predictable film stereotype. I love the choice of actors in the film. Each person seems to be able to tap in to the feelings of their character, which creates a much more realistic film. It depicts the nature of racism within peoples lives very well and shows how common loves for different things can pull people together so that simple and wrong beliefs are forgotten. Needless to say this film makes me feel better about the world, while making me want to be a winner as well."
"Being a former white athlete and coach I am sick of sports movies where the story involves a team eventually winning a championship so I passed this one by when it first came out. Big mistake!! Like ""Hoosiers"" this one was an exception and what an exception. Remember the Titans is in my top five movies of the past ten years. Denzel Washington, as the coach, gave another of his consistently outstanding performances.Like ""Hoosiers"" this is a true story and it is not just a story about sports but a strong story about race. I probably appreciated it more than most because of my background I connected to the movie. During the 1940s I attended schools which were well integrated and students of different races and cultures existed harmoniously. To a large degree, it was because the high school had a very successful football program in which unlike almost all of the other schools, minority athletes were welcome. In my junior year we went undefeated and won the State Championship and the team is still considered the best high school team of all time. The only time the team came close to defeat was in the State final when we played another well integrated team.Consequently the community while generally middle and upper class except for its minorities was well integrated. As a result although I knew racism existed, I never encountered it in my community. But then I began to see its ugly head. First, the All-American end on our team, a superb athlete, was denied scholarships both to USC and Stanford because neither school accepted minorities. I had always wanted to go to USC but because of what USC did to my friend I turned down its offer of a scholarship the next year as I did to Stanford which I considered a snob school then as I do today.But my college was cut short when the Korean War began and I was in the service. I was sent to bases in the South and I spent much of the next thirteen years in the South witnessing how bad it was for the blacks and I was involved in the civil rights movement in the South which got me into a lot of trouble with my military superiors.During my tours in the South I became head coach of a football team at a Southern base. Filled with ex-collegiate stars and some pros, we regularly played Division I colleges and universities. However, because I had black players on my team I couldn't schedule games with any white southern colleges. Instead we scheduled one black college and several state universities in the mid-west.Some critics have compared the summer camp at which Washington as Coach Boone brought the blacks and whites together as a team as like a Marine Boot Camp but everyone missed the subtlety of this. I went through Boot Camp at a time when the military was just integrating and we had southern blacks and whites as well as a mix of races from other parts of the country in my platoon as well as all classes. It didn't take very long for us to become as one unit. The first part of boot camp is sure hell and the reason for it is that it reduces everyone to the lowest common denominator of misery and you quickly learn that the only way to escape that misery is to work together. This is just the way Coach Boone made it work.What I liked about this movie is that it showed how all this played out. Most moviegoers today are not really aware of how bad racism was in 1971 but this movie illustrates it well. Even though the movie has a few corny moments and the actors playing the roles as football players look old for high school, these faults are minimal and do not detract from the power of the film."
"Based on real events in 1971, where T.C. Williams High School, a now hot bed integrated school, becomes a beacon of unification via their mixed race football team.As is normally the case with films of this ilk, it quickly comes to pass that certain artistic licence has been taken with the truth. In reality the issues of race, integration and the near powder-keg atmosphere portrayed in the picture, were long past their worst in Virginia 1971. However, that should in no way detract from the thematics and truthful aspects of this Disney production. As is told in the film, the Titans did have what became known as the perfect season, whilst the bond formed between the black and white members most definitely existed. All told, the film soars high as an inspirational piece, not only for the mixed race community coming together plot's essential being, but in the crucial tale of one Gerry Bertier.That this film urged me to seek out the story of Bertier is a testament to the power of film, regardless of any sort of sentimental prodding from the film makers. It's hoped that this film also prompts newcomers to research further the topics within the story.The cast list is impressive, Denzel Washington and Will Patton find instant chemistry as the head coaches thrust together by outside influences, with both guys beautifully doing credit to the real life friendship that would be born from the situation. Ryan Hurst, Wood Harris, Ethan Suplee, Donald Faison, Kip Pardue, Craig Kirkwood and a pre-fame Ryan Gosling fill out the integrated football team. With two important family roles nicely portrayed by Hayden Panettiere and Nicole Ari Parker. The soundtrack is nicely put together, with the core offering of Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell's thumping rendition of ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" particularly potent and uplifting.Though not primarily offering up anything new in the pantheon of race and sport related movies, Remember The Titans does have so much good going for it. It's hard to be picky, even churlish about the little faults (are these actors really the age of high schoolers for example?). So hopefully come the end, after the credits roll, you will be suitably inspired, and perhaps a touch more better off for having spent time with this particular football team. 8.5/10"
"This movie received a lot of criticism for being a little too ""light"" in it's depiction of racism in that time period. However, the fact that Disney decided to take on the topic at all astounds me. I think that this movie is incredibly effective and an excellent football movie. It really sucks you into these characters and make you feel for them. I am emotionally affected by this film no matter how many times I've seen it, and I think that this movie will stand up over time as one of the most endearing sports classics of all time.Quote that i believe defines the movie: ""I don't care if you like each other, but you will respect each other. And maybe, I don't know, maybe we can learn to play this game like men.""My personal favorite: ""I don't want them to gain another YARD, you blitz all night! They cross the line of scrimmage I swear to God I'm going to take every one of you out. You make sure they remember FOREVER, the night they played the Titans."""
"This movie is more than just about football, race relations and integration. The lead characters excellently portray the human spirit, showing that everyone can overcome not just on the field but also in life. The ending is predictable, but it draws you in with the intense emotion to win both on and off the field."
"""Remember the Titans"" is a movie that by the end of seeing it makes you feel good. And why shouldn't it? You would figure that it'll be a nice little picture since it comes from the Walt Disney Company, and I think it's perfect for the whole family. ""Remember the Titans"" is a comedy-drama based on the true story of a high school in Virginia that is integrated with white and black students, white and black teachers, and white and black athletic coaches. Oscar winner Denzel Washington gives another one of his fine performances as the new head coach of the high school football team, and Will Patton is equally good as the current head coach who is now demoted to assistant coach under Washington. Together they try to get their players of both races to get along and put on a winning team. In addition to Washington and Patton, there are some other terrific performances by the young actors who portray the football players. I see some future stars here. The movie has plenty of dramatic moments with some delightful comedy thrown in the middle of it. It obviously gets a little predictable towards the end which keeps ""Remember the Titans"" from being a perfect movie. But so what? This is a sports movie and usually sports movies almost always ends with ""the big game"". Who's going to win that big game? I won't say who wins the big game in ""Remember the Titans"", but in the end you'll be rooting for the Titans to win, win, win! And that's all that matters. Bottom line: ""Remember the Titans"" is an excellent film, very well made and very well acted by everyone involved.***1/2 (out of four)"
"Other reviewers here have covered the backstory, the direction, the production, and just about everything there is to cover for this excellent and unforgettable film. Except for one thing. It is a peculiarity of the film business that some actors peak early, for no obvious reason, and others just keep on going, like the Energizer rabbit. Michael Caine -- excuse me SIR Caine -- has been making movies for decades. Sometimes he is brilliant and sometimes he is not. Samuel L. Jackson has been in so many movies that (to this reviewer) it seems like the writers have reached the point where they no longer bother naming a character, they just pencil in the margins that they have written a part for Jackson. Denzel, who was beyond brilliant here, it is so hard to imagine anyone else doing this role with the conviction and the diction that is his trademark, seems to have stopped doing these sorts of parts (written in 2013) and frankly, more's the pity. Hollywood is like that. So on top of all the other excellent reasons to see and enjoy this film, here is one more. Denzel at his peak. What more can I say?"
"Remember the Titans was touching, uplifting, inspiring, motivating, and triumphant.  It will make you cry at parts, laugh at parts, ""goose pimples"" will appear on your arms at parts, it will also make you cheer out loud from your seat! A must see."
"A very good and very well written story about integration of a high school football team in Virginia. In 1970, segregation ended and a championship football team takes on a whole different complexion. Herman Boone(Denzel Washington)becomes the head coach of a team that already has an acclaimed coach played by Will Patton, who stays on as assistant for the good of the team. The blacks and whites work hard to overcome differences and keep the team in winning caliber. The team teaches the towns folk how to come together.I was hoping for more football scenes, but this actually turned out to be a character drama. Based on a true story, this movie leaves you feeling good and somewhat proud. The most unrealistic thing about this movie to me was the absence of swearing that is usually associated with sports and teenagers. This film comes from the Disney stables and earns all accolades on its own merits.Many stand outs in the cast featuring: Wood Harris, Kip Pardue, Craig Kirkwood, Donald A. Faison and Ethan Suplee."
"This movie is more extremely annoying. In 1971, I was in 10th grade at Washington-Lee High School in Arlington County, Virginia. We were about 5 miles from T. C. Williams (Titans) and we played them regularly in every sport (including track, which was my sport). I have personal knowledge of the events in that film. First of all, the idea that T. C. Williams had just been integrated is incorrect. Schools in the area had been integrated for 15 years. By 1971, it was routine to have blacks and whites in the same school. Come look at my yearbooks and I'll show you. What happened at T. C. Williams was this: the Alexandria school system decided to change the status of three schools..........Hammond HS, George Washington HS, and T. C. Williams HS. Hammond was reduced to a junior high, and its students were sent to Williams. GW was closed and its students were sent to Williams. Everyone in the ENTIRE AREA knew that Alexandria had just created a super sports school and it was true. With the best athletes from three schools combined into one, there was no beating T. C. Williams. We played them in football that year and they beat us about 49-0, but it sure as hell had nothing to do with integrating a school and everything about creating a super school. Next, the idea that Alexandria was a small, backward town with rampant racial prejudice is laughable. Alexandria is a MAJOR suburb of Washington, DC. You can stand in Alexandria, look across the Potomac River, and see the Washington Monument, Capitol Hill, Lincoln Memorial, Jefferson Memorial, etc. It was and is a rich suburb of DC, and racial prejudice was about as far from being mainstream as I am from marrying Miss America. In my school, the white kids were afraid of the black kids. We didn't initiate fights, we tried hard to avoid them, but sometimes they were forced upon us by angry groups of students who roamed the halls and you sure as hell better look out if you didn't cringe to the side and let them pass. There is one scene in the movie where a white football coach calls the T. C. Williams coach a ""monkey"" on local TV. Good Lord.........that sort of thing would NEVER have been put on a Washington, DC sports channel and that is where ALL the channels received in northern Virginia originated (with the exception of channel 20 which had no news at that time). The people who made this movie had an agenda. I know the facts. I was there. I ran track in that T. C. Williams stadium and they beat the hell out of us because they were a super school. It is both sad and annoying that people will watch this movie and believe that how things are portrayed is actually how they were. They absolutely were not!"
"This excellent film based on a true event is set in the early 70s and concerns a trainer (Denzel Washington) along with with his wife (Nicole Ari Parker) and family . He replaces a famed coach (Will Patton) and gets a chance working as a coach at a town (Alexandria , Virginia) , in the High school football team formed by diverse characters (Ryan Hurst, Donald Faison , Suplee, Kip Pardue, Ryan Gosling , among others) and facing the dual challenge of bringing the team to the state championship and redeeming themselves by breaking racial barriers . The coach makes the team , and each person in it , better than they thought possible . The picture is seen through the eyes of the football team where the man hired to coach the Black school is made head coach over the highly successful white coach .This enjoyable tale with a classic plot deals about a slice of American history, and is plenty of good feeling , heartfelt , interesting characters and formidable performances . Based on the real events of 1971 , the team becomes the unifying symbol for the community as the boys and the adults learn to depend on and trust each other , thanks to an enjoyable coaching . However , being sometimes extremely sentimental and predictable , but still pretty entertaining. Exceptional Denzel Washington giving a first-rate acting reaching an important milestone and terrific Will Patton in the role of assistant, they are backed by a phenomenal support cast formed by young actors with a great future and to have a wide career , as a little girl finely performed by Hayden Panettiere , today well known for ¨Heroes¨ and especially Ryan Gosling . It contains a spectacular and sensitive musical score by Trevor Ravin and colorful cinematography by Philippe Rousselot . The story follows the wake of previous sports films hits, just like : ¨Rudy¨ and ¨Hoosiers¨ (David Anspaugh) . The motion picture was well directed by Boaz Yakin , he's a notorious writer (Rookie , Punisher) , producer (Hostel I, II) and director (Fresh , Uptown girls) . Rating : Better than average , worthwhile seeing."
"Although it was quite a few years ago when I watched Remember the Titan the first time, I do remember how good it is. When it came on TV, I wouldn't want to miss it, even when it came with the commercial interruptions. It was just as good the second time around, and there are new discoveries. For example, the first time I saw it, Ron Gosling (The Believer, Murder by Numbers, The Notebook) had not yet proved to be such a good actor.What attracted me to the movie was the football, set around the time Joe Nameth took the Jet's through its most glorious season in snatching the Superbowl from the heavily favoured Baltimore Colts. But this is college football. In the movie, in a vital game when the opponents tried a shotgun, someone in the Titans quipped, ""Who do they think they are? The New York Jets?"" While the movie seems to concentrate on the Titan's defence, it was just a little before the time when the Minnesota Viking's defence, the ""purple gang"", became legendary. But then the Titans set an example for the NFL to follow, they had a ""perfect"" season, a feat the Miami Dolphins repeated in the NFL a few years later.But this is more than football. It is a wonderful movie about racial harmony, uplifting, feel-good and touching. As one commenter so beautifully puts it, let the cynics sit out on the sidelines on this one, and groan about clichés and all that. This is a movie that will warm your heart, and don't let futile vanity cheat you out of enjoying it.Nor is the movie a fairy tale. It is based on a true story. It is also realistic. The camp is an isolated environment where wonderful things can be made to happen. The kids themselves understand this when the come back to the ""real world"", as one puts it. But then, through determination and good will, they bring these wonderful things into the real world. Finally, anything with Denzel Washing in it is worth watching."
"Rememmber the Titans is a wonderful film, compelling, compassionate, funny and often moving. It tells the story of a dedicated coach seen tackling the explosive combination of football and racial desegregation in 1970s America. The film is quite ambitious, but it not only really does pack an emotional punch but it does linger long into the memory and is several notches above sports movies I have seen. For one thing, it is slickly directed by Boaz Yakin, and benefits also from wonderful cinematography and a music score of sweeping grandeur, almost epic. Even better than any of these put together, is the marvellous lead performance of Denzel Washington that was worth an Oscar, it seems as though in every film I've seen of his he manages to give a compelling performance and this includes the underrated Cry Freedom. Will Patton matches him perfectly in a smooth, quiet and perhaps low key performance as his counterpart that isn't at all clichéd. Hayden Pannetiere also gives a fine performance, even though I didn't see how her character would ever overcome her differences with her sister. The script is extremely sharp and decisive, the editing is crisp and fast and the football parts are enough to pump up your adrenaline. The epilogue could bring tears to your eyes, as it is so beautifully put. All in all, wonderful film. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"This film is one terrible lie. As with a handful of other reviewers here, I was also a victim of the TC juggernaut, having attended Groveton High School during that period. It was a joke to play TC in any varsity team sport: football, basketball, soccer... it didn't matter. Everyone knew that a school three times their size was going to destroy us -- the only question was how badly. They were never, ever, an underdog in any sport — to suggest otherwise is absolute bunk.To add insult to injury, they changed the name of our team from the Tigers to the ""Lions"" (because they felt that Tigers was too close to Titans), and they depicted us as backwater hicks... which was laughable, since Groveton served Hollin Hills, the most intellectual and progressive community in the entire DC area, as well as other upper-middle class neighborhoods filled with career government professionals.The problem, of course, is that Hollywood dreck like this becomes gospel to those who have no knowledge of the actual events. Rather than accept moral responsibility to make a film based on real life events reflect the truth, they purposefully pervert it to satisfy their biased fantasy and obliterate the historical record.I wish I could give this grossly insulting film a negative rating, to help make up for those who have embraced it as heart-rending ""truth"", given that they know nothing about the events it claims to document."
"I was slightly amused by Remember the Titans. The film is unrealistic in its portrayal of racism and prejudice in the 1970's. The sing-songy happiness of Disney ruined the film in its attempts to portray the prejudice and bigotry that existed then and still is ubiquitous today. As an example, Herman Boone didn't have a brick thrown through his window, it was a toilet. Disney added some useless things to the story in which I am referring to how they said Ronnie Bass was homosexual which in real life he wasn't and never has been. In fact he has a wife and kids. Even though the film was created by Disney, which was founded upon dreams, I say Disney overdid the fictionalization of the movie. The movie may be based upon a true story giving Disney the right to change it, but that doesn't give them the right to change it to the point that it is almost completely fiction. Disney said that the Titans played Marshall in the movie when in fact the Titans never played Marshall and really went against Andrew Lewis and won 27 to 0! The Titans only had one team put up a fight against them, in real life, and that was Woodrow Wilson during the playoffs where the score was 36 to 14 with the Titans being the winners. Gerry Bertier was crippled after the big game, not before. All schools were integrated, not just T.C. which Disney didn't say. This movie is contrived and tripe. I do not recommend this movie to anyone looking for a true story, but to people who want to see a movie with useless suspense. Like all movies made by Disney it has a happy, predictable ending that you won't remember. The only good thing I have to say about this is it has a wholesome, positive message, but I still say it is a waste of your time."
"Remember the Titans is one of the most contrived, audience insulting movies that has ever been made. Where to start with the things that suck about this movie.....1.) Not all black people break into song every few minutes of their lives.2.) Not all white people listen to country music.3.) All state championships are not won on the final play.4.) A team would not be running the ball with 20 seconds left in a game, risking a fumble. They would have just taken a knee and the game would be over.5.) There were more than 8 songs released in the 1970's. Apparently, Hollywood never got that memo.6.) The little girl. Enough said.7.) The ""transformation"" of the Gerry character happened way too fast to make it realistic. Over the course of a 2 week football camp, he went from telling the coach he didn't need any of ""them"" on the defense, to being the main guy who brought the races together.8.) Even without knowing the real story, you could see the car accident coming light years away.9.) No football team would ever just throw guys into a game on defense in the 2nd half of the state championship game who had never played on defense previously.10.) Awesome waste of Kate Bosworth. ""Now that you've won some football games with both black and white players, I'm willing to shake your hand Julius."" If only she had gone to the training camp. Then she'd understand it all so much better.11.) Let's throw in a California hippie to show that white people can be discriminated against too. The audience will never see that coming.12.) We're supposed to believe that the ""Sunshine"" character would actually doubt whether he should go into the game because he can't throw an option pitch?? 13.) Way too many impassioned speeches about being ""perfect"" and this being ""our time"". I was afraid they might run out of music to score these scenes.14.) Love the slow clap and standing ovation for Gerry's mother. Of course, the TV commentators would announce when she enters the stadium as well. By the way, did they really televise high school state championship games in 1971? 15.) Ryan Gosling's character giving up his spot to Petey because ""Petey's just better coach"".16.) This whole racism thing is important and all, but I really wanted to make the Virginia high school sports hall of fame. Now that's some big time stuff right there.17.) Let's use the white coach's trick play on the last play to show just how far these two men have come so they're winners in life as well as on the field.18.) Apparently, every time a new player comes into a game, he makes a game changing great play within the first two plays that he's in there, propelling the team to an easy victory.19.) Darn those crazy backup quarterbacks. They'll getcha every time. Can we see a movie where the starting QB gets hurt, and the season goes to hell because the backup QB sucks? There's your reality.20.) And finally, what a great message the movie gives by showing how winning football games is the solution to all the world's problems. Want to end racism? Just win some football games."
"""Remember the Titans"" tells about a black football coach (Washington) who transfers to an integrated high school where he's faced with turning black and white prejudices into teamwork and winning the state championship with a racially mixed team in a racially divided society. On the downside, ""Titans"" shows us nothing new, runs too long, gets too busy and is a journeyman production at best. On the upside, the film turns black and white issues into appropriate shades of gray, delivers lots of grid iron action, and waxes to a Rockyesque ""feel good"" conclusion. The fact that females scored this football flick higher (on IMDB.com) than males is telling."
"To say that Remember the Titans didn't stir some emotion in me would be a lie.  Having been out of high school almost seven years, the scenes on the football field stirred that old burning desire to be back on the gridiron cleaning people's clocks and having that sweet taste of victory in my mouth (although that actually happened a lot less than I'd like to admit).  And to see the way the two races forged friendships and integrated did cause a rush of emotion as well.  However, by the end of this movie, I knew all too well that my emotions had been deliberately played with and that this was the entire point of the movie.This film evokes the typical stereotypes of both a sports movie and a free-you-mind flick.  The whites and blacks who play for the newly integrated Titans are hostile to each other at first, and then miraculously at football camp they all become friends.  They are then met with the same prejudices they once shared when they return home, and the movie chronicles their struggles to remain friends as well as the rest of the communities fight to become more tolerant.  It's a great message, but one that has been done before.  Furthermore, it is such a formulaic account here that it's hardly worth the initial emotion it evokes.  On the field, the same formula (and this paragraph might be a spoiler, but then again, I'm sure you can already determine the outcome).  The Titans face tough opponents but come together to defeat them all, and, on the last play of the game with only a prayer, they somehow manage to score the winning touchdown and take the state championship (gee, haven't we seen that 300,000 times before?).If you like the emotional roller coaster ride, then this is your movie.  If, like me, you tire of seeing the same formula plugged into movies with only the names of the characters different, then avoid this like the plague.  All in all, when the emotions subside, I realized that this movie left a bitter aftertaste.I give it a 3 out of 10."
"In the last decade, I've realized that perhaps the most difficult ""genre"" of movie to make work is the SPORTS movie! Not only are there only probably a handful of 'great' sports films in the history of cinema, there are really very few 'good' sports movies (relative to how many sports films that have been made). Really, the 1980s is the end of the era of even good sports movies (and most of them about baseball!). It was officially over and done with then.All the so-called major sports flicks made in the last 10 years are pretty much formulaic and follow the same recipe: tell the tale of a bunch of downtrodden, undertalented (yet scrappy!) ""brothers"" who band together to pull off the impossible...win the big game! And I actually think that this film that I'm reviewing REMEMBER THE TITANS (2000) started this new trend of rather formulaic, soft-headed, cheesy sports movies of the last decade, which include WE ARE MARSHALL and GLORY ROAD, all of which were supposed to be ""fact-based"" movies. The problem with all these movies is that, while they may have gotten the very general details correct (character names, opponent mantres, era costumes, etc.), all these films fail where it really counts: character, dialogue, and story.Set in a 1971 D.C. suburb and starring Denzel Washington (who really had gotten long in the tooth at this point in his career!) plays yet another typical in-your-face, take-no-junk, proud black man, a hodgepodge of pretty much all the characters he had played up to that point in his career, and it's annoying! Virtually all the characters in REMEMBER THE TITANS (including Washington) are all one-dimensional and cliché. The ever reliable Will Patton does his best to overcome a thankless role as the white assistant coach that Washington's character deposes (and pretty much runs over for the entire movie!); of course Patton's character turns out to be a closet liberal and completely understanding of the man who took HIS job from him! Hayden Pannietierre, as Patton's annoyingly spunky and super-smart daughter certainly shows talent for a child actor (at the time), but what kid in the history of the world has ever acted like this?! Then you have a bunch of nameless, one-note footballers and assistant coaches of both races who somehow learn to LOVE each other! The absolutely most annoying character was that faux-gay transfer surfer dude from California, who is one of the weirdest characters ever to grace the movie screen!The only tolerable characters in the film are played by Ryan Hurst and Wood Harris as the prospective leaders of the white and black players and help bring them all together. Their personal relationship is actually authentic (thus the extra star!), but everything surrounding them is NOT! In real life (which this movie is supposed to be based on), even post 60s (1971 to be exact), I find it hard to believe that opposite races would have hated each other so vehemently at the start of the film, only to end up getting along so famously by the end of it, especially on a team that was literally FORCED to be together!"
"Racial prejudice is the pariah of our society. It permeates every avenue to making the world a fair place to live. It's not just American society either. It's in the North, the South, and everywhere overseas. Prejudice is counterproductive and ugly. This movie sort of pretends to rise above it. It's a feel good movie in some respects. While racism is at the center of the film, the answers are just a little too pat. It's just a little too easy. Granted, it's just a movie, but I wish it got a little more down and dirty. A trip to a training camp out of town and a lecture on the Gettysburg battlefield just wouldn't do it. Some of these kids are going to hold onto stuff their parents have driven into them a lot longer than this. Now all that said, I still enjoyed the film. The characterizations of Coach Boone and Coach Yoast are well drawn. They are both good men who love their players. They are both excellent role models. And the players and the game scenes are believable (although I am getting tired of every hit on the field sounding like a Buick hitting a concrete wall--this is happening in most football movies). The growth of Gary and the Rev is nicely done and we hope that it really happened that way. I enjoyed the two white guys who just kind of matter of factly walked into practice--Sunshine and Louis--who just wanted to play football. There are some kids out there who don't think about race very much. They are pretty naive, but they are charming. I loved when Louis hugged Coach Boone and told him he was going to college. That's a nice touch. I could go on, but others have said so much already. It's a good action movie with nice human characters. It just gets a little simplistic at times and it needs to answer for that."
"It is common knowledge in the film critic community that sentimentality, if used improperly, is among the most hated of all celluloid evils. ""Remember The Titans"" provides a step-by-step lesson in how not to use it.The film is based on the true story of the Titans, a high school football team from the small town of Alexandria, Virginia. It is 1971, their school has just been integrated, and their beloved head coach (Patton) has been replaced with a fiery African-American named Herman Boone (Washington). The players encounter a flurry of racial problems, and Boone hauls them all away to training camp to make them become not just a perfect football team, but friends as well. The film then chronicles the Titans' perfect season as they struggle to cope with a hateful, bigoted nation.From the first to the last frame of ""Titans"", the audience is bombarded with an insurmountable amount of genre clichés and cringe-inducing cheese. To give you an idea of said cheese, let me just say that I cannot count on my fingers the number of times one or more characters randomly burst into song for no reason, usually singing what is sort of the film's theme song, ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" by Diana Ross. This is meant to be heart-warming, playful, and inspiring, but it just comes off as irritating. As far as clichés...lord, where do I start? We have copious amounts of ""soulful"" black characters who want to do nothing but love their ""brothers"", the ""tough"" controversial coach who just wants to unite the team (and his underdeveloped assistant who just acts as someone to feed him back lines so he can essentially have conversations with himself), the promising athlete who is injured just before the ""big game"", the ostentatious ladies' man with a big ego, the sensitive, ""enlightened"" hippie with long blonde locks (who is, of course, considered homosexual), the up-tight redneck who always hates ""c--ns"" no matter what, the lovable ""Bubba"", the ""cute"" ""I'm nine and a half!"" tomboy girl who loves football, not Barbies (complete with a foil little girl to emphasize how much she loves football and hates Barbies!), and two, count 'em, two token ""fat guys"" whose purpose is to simply provide contrived comic relief, usually in the form of singing the aforementioned ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"".On top of the script being shallow, predictable, conventional, and all too sentimental, I think one of the things that bothered me the most about ""Titans"" was Trevor Rabin's intrusive, grating score. It was nothing but a ubiquitous, inescapable cliché trying to tell the audience what to think. It was, to put it bluntly, insulting.The acting is capably handled by Denzel Washington and Will Patton (who are both very talented actors who consistently accept awful roles), but everyone else in this turgid mess stumbles through their bland scenes and poorly-written lines with about as much intensity as a dead turtle. The direction, delivered by Boaz Yakin (whose illustrious directing career is comprised of three other films including the fabulous ""Uptown Girls""! He also wrote such fantastic films as ""From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money"", ""Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights"", and, surprise, surprise, ""The Rookie"", another touching Disney sports extravaganza!), is utterly pedestrian. Also, the soundtrack is comprised of '60s and '70s rock songs that are all great, but have become nothing more than mood-setting clichés (someone's been watching too much ""Forrest Gump"").""Remember The Titans"" also suffers from the severe detriment of taking itself too seriously. It is trying so self-consciously hard to deliver a message that it ends up doing nothing but degrading the audience's intelligence with its obvious agenda. It tries to force us to laugh, cry, and be inspired, but it only succeeds in annoying us.The only thing that saves this film from falling into the D range are its occasional entertaining moments, but they are far too little to save this twisted wreck of overused morals and tired storytelling vehicles. Denzel, please try to stay away from horrid wastes of celluloid such as this and try to star in more films like ""Training Day"". You can do better.4/10"
This was boring. I couldn't believe how typecast the characters were. Each scene felt as if it were cut short or compressed into a small time frame so that the story could be told. What a waste of time! The acting was wooden and none of the characters were believable.
"Although a mite too predictable, ""Remember the Titans"" is an inspiring and entertaining movie.  The true story of the integration of a Virginia high school football team and the warm multicultural relationships which developed among the team members, staff and families, the film reminds us once again when working together in a common effort, one can find love and friendship in the most unlikely places.  As the head coach, Denzel Washington uses military-style techniques which have been shown time and again to succeed in creating unity and team spirit among people from different backgrounds.  Big surprise here.  The film's most important lesson is for people to give each other enough respect and trust before making judgements about other people.  The film glosses over the genuine cultural differences between black and white communities.  They do exist, though are generally minimal among people of the same socioeconomic class. This isn't really important except to those who feel this kind of thing has been done to death over the last three decades.  Even they will find plenty to enjoy in ""Remember the Titan's"".  There's plenty of humor and action (some really tough looking football plays).  There is also one truly amazing performance, that of Hayden Panettiere as Cheryl Yost.  Hayden is TOTALLY convincing as Will Patton's football-obsessed daughter.  She's also spunky, charming and strong-willed. There's nothing bitchy about this little girl.  You believe she could tear your head off if she put her mind to it.  Yet, She still manages to be very feminine and cute.  As I said, a truly amazing performance.This movies a keeper.  I'll probably pull this one out about once a year just to lift my spirits."
"It certainly wasn't the sport shown in this movie that made me decide to give it a try. I don't know anything about American Football and it's probably one of the least known sports over here, because we only get to see something of it once a year: when the Superbowl is on. So that didn't do it for me, but what made me decide to watch it was the fact that Denzel Washington played an important role in it.He's coach Herman Boone, a newly appointed African-American football coach who will have to lead a high school football team in Virginia, during the early 70's. Racism is still the norm and even though the school has been recently mixed under federal mandate, integration is far from reality. Many white players even threaten to sit out until he is replaced by a white coach. But he doesn't give up that easily and during a training camp, he learns the white and black players how to get along. In the end they all become friends and it's that bond that will get them through the season undefeated. But when the captain of the team gets injured in a car accident, just before the state championship, they will have to prove that they can adapt and that they still can win the match...True stories have always been a great source of inspiration for Hollywood, but personally I can't name too many of these movies that I really liked. The main reason for that is that they are almost always preachy and as sweet as syrup. ""Remember the Titans"" doesn't completely get caught in that trap, but isn't really able to avoid it either. Or wouldn't you call a movie that shows a coach, who goes with his team to one of the greatest battlefields on the American continent, while giving away a speech about team spirit, fighting for each other and things like that, not preachy??? I certainly do, but I'm glad that not everything about the movie was like that.The acting for instance was OK. You can't expect anything less than OK from a man like Denzel Washington of course, but most of the other actors did a nice job too, even though most of them were complete strangers to me. The direction too isn't bad. Again, Boaz Yakin is a complete stranger to me, but what he has done with this movie could have been a lot worse. OK, there is nothing exceptional, original or daring about it, but he knows the conventions of the genre and has followed them rule by rule.All in all I must say that this wasn't the worst movie about sports. OK, it will never be in my list of favorite movies, but there are worse ways to spend your time. I'm sure that it will be loved by the American audience, especially the young males, because this is one of those typical American spectacles. But even the others might give it a try. I did and wasn't completely convinced, but also not entirely disappointed by it. That's why I give it a score in between a 6.5/10 and a 7/10."
"Tossing it out there like a football, this sport movie produced by Jerry Bruckheimer isn't really much about football, but preaching against racism. Inspired by real events, the movie starts out with a new football coach of the TC Williams High School Titans, Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) must put a newly desegregated school football team together. He faced pressure from a staff, and town not yet ready to be racial diversity. Denzel Washington portrays Boone as a hard-ass man. Most of the scenes, we hardly see him lightly up. He puts his team of real life athletes made out of yet famous oncoming actors through the grinder through football camp. Look out for Donald Faison, Ethan Suplee, and Ryan Gosling all new, whom gone off to bigger and better roles. This team is lead by team captains Gerry Bertier (Ryan Hurst of 'Son of Anarachy' fame) and Julius Campbell (Wood Harris) or as they are mostly known as Main White Guy and Main Black Guy. After returning from football camp, Boone is told by a member of the school board that if he loses even a single game, he will be fired. Not only that, but there is hatred for him, replacing long favorite coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton). Note to audience, look out for a really young Hayden Panettiere playing his tomboy football fan daughter. Bill decides he wants move on to other coaching opportunities. In a show of respect and in an attempt to ease racial tension, Boone offers an assistant coaching position to Yoast. Yoast at first refuses Boone's offer, but is then tempted to join after the white players pledge to boycott the team if he doesn't participate. Dismayed at the prospect of the students losing their chances at scholarships, Yoast changes his mind. Subsequently, the Titans must go through the season undefeated while battling racial prejudice. The movie has a good message, but it's so predictable, and formulaic. It's always there to remind you that racism is bad. Sometimes the movie can be a little bit too preachy. The long-suffering, heroic black players are all portrayed as decent if understandably angry given the atmosphere of overt hostility, but with few flaws that might flesh out or sully their characters' purity as symbols in the civil rights struggle. The white players, on the other hand, range from the villainous to the buffoonish to the saintly. You see this time after time in Hollywood movies before and after. It's become too much of the same. The film also suffers from historically inaccurates, and fabrications sub-stories, while it's doesn't hurt the film at all, it shines some real-life characters in a bad light or misleading such as Bertier's girlfriend being racist and Ronald 'Sunshine' Bass being bi or gay. The people of Alexandria were rarely racist at all, but also sophisticated and multicultural at the time, as the streets were suburbs rather than a small, isolated town picture in the film. I'm not saying there wasn't racial tension, but not in what they made picture in the film. One of the worst thing about the film is the third act and ending--- the film goes off into 'Win one for the gipper' mode to demonstrate the essence of the film; that despite differences the team was united and the legacy of the monumental all-out-victory football season carried on. Rather than ending the film at the final game, the film leaves the audience in a sour-note by explaining what happen to one of their team members 10 years later. The epilogue reveals what many of the Titans are doing today was kinda cheesy. The film does a great job on the use of music, both in film score composer in Trevor Rabin 'Titan Spirit' which is epic and the use of popular music of the day such as Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" of Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell & 'Na Na Hey Hey Goodbye"" Steam. All three songs has been associated for years after this movie with the Titans. Most known those tunes by this movie. The movie is a family friendly movie. So check it out, and remember the titans."
"Although Remember The Titans is based on a true story from Northern Virginia in 1971, I couldn't help feeling that I had seen this story before. Then I remembered that a short time before the incidents on which this film is based occurred, there was a film made called Tic Tic Tic. This also involved a southern town growing out of the old days and into the new ones with the post Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act. In that film a new black sheriff played by Jim Brown is elected in a southern town and he asks the former sheriff George Kennedy to stay on as his deputy to help ease the tensions.When the folks who were making Tic Tic Tic happen on the big screen, how could they have known that life was imitating their art. This northern Virginia town was being integrated, black people were now voting, the schools and businesses were being integrated, the city fathers had to take into account a whole new population with the franchise. Successful football coach Will Patton is asked to step aside for Denzel Washington, newly arrived from North Carolina. Patton agrees to stay on as his defensive assistant coach to help the team and not incidentally the town. Because of the good will and good intentions of two strong personalities they make the newly integrated team the Titans work.Even with two Academy Awards and several nominations besides, I doubt Denzel Washington will ever get a more beloved role than Herman Boone. In addition to coach, Washington is husband to Nicole Ari Parker and father to Krysten Leigh Jones. Later on when Patton's daughter Hayden Panettiere comes over to the Washington household to visit, she spends more time with Washington going over the game than with her peer dressing the dolls that little girls are supposed to play with. My favorite scene in the film is with Washington and Panettiere who loves the idea of a child even a girl taking an interest in what puts food on the table, but not quite understanding it. The kids make it work as well. Ryan Hurst who was the team captain under Patton and Donald Faison one of the new black players forge their own bond and make it happen for the rest. Those who won't go with the new program have to learn or leave. My two favorites are the two outsiders who also help make it work. Kip Pardue plays a California hippie type kid who also likes football, if you can fathom that combination and Ethan Suplee who just moved into town and just wants to play football. Neither of them are hung up on all the racial stuff the town was going through, they're presence on the Titans is invaluable.You won't have any problems in remembering the Titans. This is a fine inspirational film showing that people of good will can put hate aside if the better parts of their person is appealed to."
"The person who assigns parts to actors always has a very important job, but his choices can become crucial in the case of a movie involving a sport. Miscasting in this kind of movie can subject some performers to ridicule and doom even the most thoughtful and well written story to mediocrity. In a story about a singer/musician, for example, the woman selected to play the part of the entertainer can learn the lyrics to various songs, sway and smile, engage an audience, move her mouth and her hands. She does not have to truly sing or play an instrument. Similarly, a man chosen to play the part of a United States president or well-known foreign leader can prepare by learning the significant events that took place during the ruler's reign, study his idiosyncrasies and mannerisms, and memorize important speeches - almost a natural task for an actor. He does not have to have ever held a government post as a prerequisite.I don't mean to imply that an actor with only community theater experience could easily play one of the above parts in a major motion picture, or that a person awarded for his performance in one of these roles would not deserve the recognition. The person who portrays an athlete might in some ways, in fact, have a less challenging job. But unlike the actor who plays the part of an entertainer or a politician (or who portrays a doctor, a priest, a teacher, a criminal, a soldier, a pilot, an explorer, or a lawyer, for that matter), the one who plays the part of an athlete has definite limits with respect to what he can pretend. He can't fake agility, coordination, a comfortable running style, a natural throwing motion or catching form; he must demonstrate skills beyond his acting.Remember The Titans moved and inspired me (despite a few scenes and some dialog that sort of manipulate a viewer's feelings) partly because the young men playing members of that football team not only swaggered, jostled, bantered, and jived like high school athletes, they also played like them. This movie benefits from equally impressive performances from the adults. Denzel Washington did a commendable job as Herman Boone, the demanding, domineering, yet fair head football coach, and Will Patton did tremendous work as the demoted head coach Bill Yoast, the mentor with the softer approach and rather folksy style, who must deal with the immaturity of his bigoted friends as well as his tendency to patronize the African American members of the team."
"Remember the Titans is an excellent sports-drama, written by the American Gregory Allen Howard. It's directed by the seemingly unknown Boaz Yakin who puts his skills to action very well in this film. It is film that's based upon a true story it premiered in the U.S late 2000.A small suburb in Virginia seems perfect from the outside, but the society is based on racial inequalities of large proportions. But under a federal mandate a school in for Afro-Americans in Virginia gets integrated to T.C. Williams High School. Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) is a successful football coach who gets assigned to lead the merged high school football team. Tensions arise when this fact is introduced to the Titans, consisting of both black and white students. Due to the segregation within the group, their performance as a team is obviously unsatisfactory.Consequently Herman takes them on a bonding trip, to overcome the racial differences. Herman is not like any other coach, he distinguishes himself as a winner, and he will not tolerate any mistakes. The team's affections for each other become more profound than Herman ever expected. And as the season progresses the team's success ultimately causes the entire community to accept the changes.The overall performance of Denzel is rock solid all the way through, and same goes for the rest of actors. The soundtrack is also a delight since it's filled with great oldies recognized by anyone. Among these songs we find ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" by Marvin Gaye and ""Spirit in the Sky"" by Norman Greenbaum just to mention a few. The main symphony theme also blends perfectly during those special, touching, moments.Personally I got very interested in trying out American football while watching this film. It's also a very inspiring interpretation of what's possible when you work as a team. They Titans believed in their caused and proved for the rest of the society what's possible together. If black and white can cooperate perfectly in the football stadium, why wouldn't it be the same on the outside? I particularly admire this film for it moral values. It surpasses the ethical differences and shows that everyone is capable of respecting each other. I think this is an important message to remember, considering mankind's violent nature, and history, with wars and discrimination."
"Similar to ""Hoosiers"" but a totally different story just the same. Washington was perfect as the hard nosed coach dedicated to winning. His efforts to bring the players together as a unit and the boys attitudes toward him and each other made for a very good drama. I foretold the ending, plus the picture contained some corny scenes, but I still give it a high rating."
"This film is a bastardization of black/American history. Now, lets start from the beginning, another film about interracial, or prejudicial/bigotry issues between players on a team (played out to death in modern American movies). I can think of countless examples; Coach Carter, School Ties, Radio, Rudy, Varsity Blues, The Program, and...yes, the list of mediocrity continues, but I'll cut it short! You see, I'm not really into sports, but that isn't why I dislike this film so strongly. My reason is that the whole racial issues aspect is a little out-played/out-dated, the acting-lazy, and the film as a whole, rather corny and pretentious, with a lingering air of belligerence and predictability. The little girl (Sheryl) played by Hayden Panettiere as Coach Bill's outspoken daughter was absolutely unrealistic and obnoxious. She was loud, boyish, and downright rude at times. Her father deserved a slap in the face for raising such brash, insensitive little child. She reminded me of a lesbian version of Rhoda from the Bad Seed (1956). The lead character Coach Herman (Denzel Washigton) had no character-development and was at times overly dramatic, rash, and had an exaggerated confidence that destroyed the intended character. I also found the film to be very mediocre, and if that wasn't bad enough, sexist as well. Yes, I know, the film is about men on a football team, but the women characters that were present (rare), like the wives and girl friends, were plain, waif-like and generic. They mostly had one-liner dialog and scenes that lasted literally seconds. So if you appreciate not-so-predictable, fresh and more captivating entertainment and history told as it is without the commercial addition of crude jokes and bad characters, skip this film. Overall, an interesting premise, but horribly executed and poorly acted/directed."
"ye gods...will people never tire of films that simply gloss over ugly history? stereotypes abound in this film: the black players are mostly a minstrel show (with the exception of julius who is the silent angry one). and among the white players are a bunch of corny hokey hicks and the hippie Californian. also, historical inaccuracy is just irksome. face the truth: not all whites were bad, not all blacks were noble. the football scenes weren't bad, but being a former linebacker, i was shushed several times for laughing at the inaccuracies. all in all, this is barely fit for grade school age kids (incidentally, the very group i rented the movie for: my niece and nephew, age 8 and 10, and even the youngest of the two had enough sense to be skeptical). heck while they were at it, why didn't the makers of this movie throw in a kid from the wrong side of the tracks who proves himself to have a heart of gold and a physically deformed kid with ""shining inner beauty."" the most entertaining part of the movie was seeing Denzel Washington ask one of his players ""Who's your daddy?"" well, that and watching a fumble being returned for a ""touchdown""...in the wrong direction. seems bruckheimer can blow stuff up, but can't handle the simplest parts of football. stick to what you know."
"This movie started out as a straight drama, and took a serious wrong turn towards a comedic styling better suited for MAJOR LEAGUE/BULL DURHAM/REPLACEMENTS and others of that ilk.  When the guy kisses his teammate with no motivation whatsoever, it's burlesque farce.  When the team unites to sing Motown (and badly at that), it's the equivalent of Romeo and Juliet in character doing a scene on ER. These scenes intercepted the film midway for a touchdown on the side of political correctness and created an inconsistency in styles of performing in the open against style at the end.To paraphrase the late Robert Reed: ""once a film opens in a given style of acting/writing/directing;  it cannot under any circumstances introduce (let alone accept) a different style"".As such, I cannot recommend this film to anyone.  For straight football drama done right, rent BRIAN'S SONG or THE LONGEST YARD instead."
So what is the big deal with this nonsense? Just another jock macho sports movie filled with clichés. Except in this one the players feel some silly need to come dancing out onto the football field like a bunch of girls. Too many films have been made about sports and how they inspire kids to be better or help bring young boys into manhood with a fancy been around the block coach. Denzel Washington plays the part well but his speechifying about respect and race start to drag after a while. Even the cute little girl who throws temper tantrums during the Titans games when they are not playing well or lectures Denzel on the strategies of the sport made me want to say enough. So do yourself a favor and forget the Titans. Plus the fact their singing sucks!
"""Remember the Titans"" is a terrible movie. Period. If you are ten years old and have only seen cartoons before, it might hold your interest. I really wanted to like it, because it is based on a real story and involves serious themes (overcoming adversity, racial prejudice). The script would not let me enjoy it, with one ridiculous cliche after another. Also, I played high school football, and the idea that a guy as out of shape as Ethan Suplee would even survive a practice, let alone play, is insulting. Rent ""Lucas"" instead."
"Generally speaking, I am a pretty jaded reviewer on IMDb. I am not known for being overly generous to films and I must admit that I am often very critical. It is in light of my very critical nature that my loving this film is so amazing. I have seen it several times and although it occasionally changes a few minor details of the real-life football team to make the film more poignant, the overall film is truthful and uplifting. If you are curious about these inaccuracies, read through the list on IMDb, though this didn't lessen my appreciation for the film when I read them. That's because despite these changes, the acting still was great, the direction and writing wonderful and highly manipulative (in a positive way). This is a film for anyone--child, teen or adult. And the part about this I like the best is that I have shown this film to teens and those who hate football still have loved the movie. Marvelous entertainment that anyone but the most jaded can enjoy."
"This movie insults its audience.Where should I start? To begin with, the cast is ok. Denzel is as usual, Denzel, but makes a good job. Will Patton is more softspoken and more believable. The rest fills in rather nicely as college students or inbred rednecks.But every character is stereotyped, you know where the plot will take you, and the lines are so, so, so incredibly stuffed and rigid. Nobody says things like that in real life. Every line is like a well rehearsed speech (which frankly they are, since it's a movie).The football matches are well shot, but not very interesting. If you don't know the game they are too short to really give a feel of the game. If you do know the game, they are too short to be exciting, as you never actually can follow a game in the movie.Based on a true story, but nevertheless totally predictable, right up to the ending. Dull, dull, dull.Oh wait, there's a message; Don't judge anyone because of their colour. Well, the bible could probably tell you that. As for the race issue, there are lots of other movies which both delivers the message better, and are better as movies. Like American History X, which tries to deal with the root of the problem instead of glossing it over like this movie does."
"I don't know if it' my bad history with Disney movies or what, but this movie was a complete waste of time. It has a story line that's too slow and boring. If you haven't seen Remember the Titans, and are thinking about renting it, DON'T!! It's not even worth the 5 bucks, or how ever much they charge at you video place. One of the worst things about this movie is it's got this real annoying song that they sing about every 5 incredibly boring minutes! I would not recommend this movie (obviously) due to boring story line and annoying song."
"Normally even if I don't like a film i'll explain the plot and trash it eloquently, but not with this heaping-pile of diseased walrus dung.This film is what happens a bad hallmark card vomits and mixes with Disney. When this abomination was complete it let off a stench so foul and heinous it actually started global warming. This should have been one of those garbage straight to video Disney films with unknown actors. That would have been to easy they had to go get the great Denzel Washington, veteran of films like Glory, Philadelphia, Training Day, etc, and drag him down. Worse even then Denzel, they dare to sully the glorious name of Football. How dare these vermin try to castrate America's true National Pastime. I wish I could line up one of those stuffed shirt, studio, prancing, pre-madonna's that green lighted this, and go flying into them helmet first. If anyone's ever played football, or just enjoys the game, they'll realize this film has nothing to do with football. The higher ups involved had better hope there is no God or surely there judgment will be great, prehaps they'll even be forced to watch this film.If you come upon some individual whether it be a friend or neighbor, co-worker or boss, relative or stranger, big or small, black or white, and in the course of your discussions this film comes up and by some reason they should bring up this film and mention something the least bit positive about it berate them immediately and forcefully, show absolutely no mercy as they deserve none. Remember at this point we may not even be dealing with actual humans that have souls. Let them know they are lowering the bar on humanity, tell them they should not be allowed to procreate and your opinion of them has changed to a degree that it might never be saved. If they start to argue remain calm and go straight to the evidence. Show them the film, I know this opens up an ethical dilemma as to paying money to see it but that's another discussion, and point out the garbage frame by frame and line by line if necessary. If they see the light and error of their ways openly embrace them and tell them everyday will now be better then the last. If however they still like the filth tell them to leave and never bother you again, so that you and your family might live in peace separated from such dastardly swine."
"This movie was very good..It is now my favorite movie..the characters played the parts very well... It was really funny and at the end very sad which it probally made a lot of people cry, i know i did. Well it is the best movie i have ever seen.."
"Wow! What a great movie. Really well done.It concentrates on football, sure, but it really is about addressing racial issues, and the strength of the human spirit - that you can overcome any boundary if you put your mind to it. The film does this through football. What I really like about Remember the Titans, is that it addresses these issues in a subtitle way. It isn't all in your face harmony. It does it through the characters' journeys, and experiences, and this seems to come out more maturely, and gets the point across much more powerfully. I have to say that the only reason this was not rated higher is because I have seen it so many times it is beginning to annoy me. But I would recommend it to anyone. Great movie, addressing great issues."
"It's no secret that Remember the Titans gives everyone goosebumps. Granted, there's a lot of historical inaccuracies. But who cares? It's awesome! If you don't get a shiver down your spine when the defense shouts, ""LEFT SIDE, STRONG SIDE"" you're not human. Just go ahead and watch this for the 15,000th time."
I love this movie is really interesting. And it has a lot of action.i will really recommended this movie to anyone that likes football or any sports.I also love this movie because i love Denzil Washington. he plays a really good character in the movie like he always does.i believe that the movie was great except for the scene that sunshine kiss Garry in the mouth. but besides that scene the movie was great. i like the fact that the coach re-united the team with African Americans and white men but at least they should had put Mexicans too.I really enjoy this movie i really hope that everyone would have a chance to see this movie because is wonderful.
"I don't get the common ""its too predictable"" argument. What do you want from a movie made by Disney about football? Some peoples complaints are as unrealistic as the movie they are complaining about. Of course the whites and blacks miraculously go from hating each other to liking each other. THATS THE POINT OF THE MOVIE! Of course the championship is won on the last play. Sorry to say but most footballs games, especially the ones that are over quickly are BORING AS HELL. When a game goes down to the wire its entertainment, the point of a movie is to entertain.I always enjoy Denzel Washingtons performances, and this is no exception. Another great performance from a great actor.Its a fantastic movie to take your kids to as well. Drop your pretensions and enjoy it for what it is."
"I grew up watching this movie and it has been one of my favorites for a long time. When I was really young, I used to say that I liked it just to impress my dad by liking a football movie (he loves football), but once I got older, I actually did love it. I just love the feel of it, the characters, and the growth that the team goes through.
The movie is about a high school football team that is put together right after the desegregation of black and white students in schools. Throughout the movie, the team grows closer and become a really good football team.
This movie is based on a true story, but it is not very accurate. I think it may be accurate in portraying what it was like after schools were desegregated, but not totally accurate in portraying the specific story of this high school football team. I think a lot of what it shows still applies today even though that event occurred in the 70's. Today, there are still people fighting against change and against people who are different than them. There is still discrimination among many groups all over the world.
The director of this movie is Boaz Yakin. He did an amazing job directing this movie. This is the only movie I have seen that he has directed. Some of the main actors in this movie are Denzel Washington, Ryan Hurst, Wood Harris, and Will Patton. They are all great actors and played their roles well. I have seen Denzel Washington in other movies and I love him as an actor. My favorite scene in this movie was when Gerry and Julius become really good friends after hating each other. I just loved the connection that they had.
Even though this movie is not very accurate to the story it is based on, I still love it. I thought it was really well acted, and the characters worked well together. I liked that it brought out serious themes like hard work, equality, and treating others with kindness, but was also fun and entertaining. This is a movie that I definitely recommend."
"This is a good film with a lot of good uplifting music but like all Disney films it is highly sanitized and joyful. Its set in the early 70's in Virginia, and yet the only racial slurs used where ""coon"" and ""boy"" both derogatory racial terms for blacks, but still not truly how it would have been back then. That is the problem with Disney is that they try to make every film super clean and G-rated to get the widest audiences but they often forget how to keep it true and realistic to the time and place that it is supposedly taking place. And to top it off, having to compress it into a regular time allotment for a film they sped up the parts of training in which the people actually did bond and become close, but that took most of the training camp for them to do not over night."
"Remember the Titans Review""Remember the Titans"" is a compelling story of perseverance and tolerance that warms your heart with the bond of a tightly knit high school football team. Throughout the movie, there are battles between whites and blacks, and the Titans against their weekly opponents. They are playing to prove that they are the best in the state and that blacks and whites work as one. This movie acts as a metaphor for the struggles of life, which makes it easy for anyone to connect with the movie. ""Remember the Titans"" is set back in 1971 in Alexandria, Virginia, less than 10 years after the Civil Rights act was passed. Tension between blacks and whites is at its highest in Alexandria when the high school becomes integrated and Coach Boone (Denzel Washington) is hired as the head coach of the high school football team and he replaces, now assistant head coach, Coach Yoast (Will Patton). This change causes the white kids to second guess playing football because they don't want to play for a black coach or with black teammates. But both coaches come to agreement and take their appointed roles as coaches. They haul both black and white players off to football camp so bonds can be made and they can learn to play as one. The director, Boaz Yakin, does a great job of showing that friendships are important through the plot of this movie. Boaz gives us an important example of finding who your true friends are. He illustrates this point by showing us a scene where a white player breaks up with his girlfriends because she didn't approve of his interactions with the black players. This one decision made by a white teammate proved to most of the other players that whether they were black or white, that they could put aside their differences and just be friends. Boaz Yakin presents the dialogue and setting of this film in a way that makes you feel like you were watching a movie developed in the 1970's. Like explained before, there was still tension between blacks and whites at this time. This movie really gives you a good demonstration of what life would be like to be black, friends with blacks, or even what goes through the mind of white people who discriminated blacks. This is another aspect of the film where the director does a great job.. Though I really like this movie, there is one thing that might take this movie down a notch. That factor is that it isn't very original. This isn't the first movie ever made that shows the integration of blacks and whites in sports. Also, there are characters that have been used in previous sports movies like the classic fat kid. Or the guy that joins the team and has never played before who ends up being a key player. Then there are the moments where two guys that fight each other end up being the closest of friends. Even though they may not be original thought, I think the director and the actors do a good job of using these ""old news"" situations and making them intertwine with the plot of the movie. The overall mood of ""Remember the Titans"" is excited or happy even though there are some sad moments. I say the mood is exciting because there are lots of moments where your skin begins to tingle from what just happened or from what is about to happen. The mood ties in with the acting and the atmosphere very well. Just look for a slight smirk from Coach Boone or listen to the roar of the crowd. Those small bits in the movie make you feel part of the moment and give you flashbacks of good times. ""Remember the Titans"" is a good movie. It has everything a person could want in a film and everything you really need. I personally feel that everyone should watch it, either just to watch a good movie or to have a very good message illustrated for you. I give it an 8/10."
"Without a doubt, the movie ""Remember the Titans"" tries to depict the challenges and difficulties of racial integration after the Civil Rights Act was implemented. In the case of this movie, this film tries to show racism within a particular high school football team. Their attempt was promising but the movie's aim was not to show the racial harmony and problems but rather simply about football. This movie is based on a true story that talks about an African American football coach named Herman Boone (played by Denzel Washington) who is hired by a Virginia High School during 1971 to coach the Titans on his first year in T.C. Williams High School replacing Bill Yoast (played by Will Patton) whom is beloved by the school. Both men are not happy with the situation and circumstances they are put into. But they agree that for the sake of the team, they must cooperate and achieve their goal. A great example would be when Yoast tells Boone to treat his players like marines rather than high school students and does so. I thought that both Boone and Yoast were portrayed quite nicely, Boone does not show any sense of noble or arrogance and neither does Yoast show any signs of racism of being a racist for that matter. In fact, both characters show their ambition to win and how skilled they are at football. Another scene, which I personally enjoyed, was the ending where there was the closing touchdown, I felt that it resembled the end and victory over racism. The Film somewhat historically accurate but I felt that there was a lot of drama throughout the film. Of course, Hollywood loves to alter certain parts of the story to make it more ""interesting"" or ""compelling"". It also seems that the film was ""exaggerated"" but overall, the film was quite accurate. But there are some raising questions during the film, such as we could only see that the Whites are afraid of losing their positions in the team thus not wanting to play with the blacks, but what about the blacks themselves? Didn't they transfer from an all black school? This film shows that the white people are very possessive and want to resent the blacks, and that the blacks themselves are feeling grateful and happy due to transferring to a better school. Another questioned raised is that what happened to the coach in the all blacks school? Why was Boone transferred to coach but not the coach from the all blacks school? This shows that the film has left out some possible information that might affect the movie dramatically. ""Remember the Titans"" is a predictable and heart warming film with strong emotional themes and powerful music but there are some areas where the film was lacking such as stated before, over-exaggeration of dramatization and the limited solution of racism depicted during the film. Overall, I would give this film a rating of 7/10.-Nicholas Chong"
"Remember the Titans Engaging But ExaggeratedEven though the film Remember the Titans, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and Chad Oman was a very emotionally engaging and entertaining movie, the sequence of events that occurred were seemingly exaggerated. The film Remember the Titans was inspired by the actual events that occurred in Alexandria, Virginia in 1971, which explores many of the fundamental issues of racism in the 19th century.The film, directed by Boaz Yakin, follows the story of Herman Boone (played by Denzel Washington), an African American who comes to T.C Williams High School to coach the T.C. William's football team, the Titans. Racially divided, Herman Boone faces difficulty in getting the boys on his team to connect with each other, and also faces many instances of conflict with his white assistant coach, Bill Yoast (played by Will Patton), who had previously been the head coach. After going to training camp together and forcing the African American boys and white boys to further integrate and get to know each other, eventually the team learns to come together despite the racial divide that is still present in their town, Alexandria, Virginia. As the movie progresses, the bond between the players of both races develop and grow stronger, despite the initial hostility that plagued both the blacks and whites on the team. Wood Harris and Ryan Hurst also star in the film, playing the characters Julius Campbell and Gerry Bertier, respectively. Both characters play important roles in the film, leading and setting an example of the strong relationship that can be developed regardless of skin color. Initially facing a lot of discrimination from other teams, parents, and townspeople, together the Titans eventually start to change the views of the common people through football, in which they continue to have an unbelievable season. The film Remember the Titans was overall a very well made drama that at the same time also informed viewers of the issue that surrounded that time period. Through out the film, you begin to gain a great love for football after seeing how it affectively brings together the whites and African Americans in the movie. Furthermore the choice of music further enhanced the emotional connection with the film while also exaggerating it to make it more amusing. An example being where the song Ain't No Mountain High Enough by Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terell was played in a scene where everyone was joyfully singing together in the locker rooms. The storyline seemed well developed and was easy to follow, always leaving the viewer interested and engaged with the film. However, in comparison to how the events actually occurred, the screenplay did seem exaggerated and in some cases, the characters misrepresented. For example, near the beginning of the film, on the street you see angry citizens, both black and white, ready to attack each other while standing on the opposite side of the street, divided by only a few policemen. Even though at that time there was a lot of racial tension, the film did over exaggerate the conditions. Ronnie Bass who was portrayed by Kip Pardue in the film was quoted saying, ""They had a community divided down black and white, and it really wasn't like that in 1971 Alexandria,"" in an interview with the Greenville News. Besides this, the scene in which Herman Boone woke his team up at 3:00 am to go to the Gettysburg battlefield to give a motivational speech seemed far fetched from what actually happened. Furthermore, it was Ronnie Bass who also seemed to have been misrepresented in the film. In the film, Ronnie Bass was portrayed as being a hippie who was attracted to guys, where in one scene even ends up kissing a fellow teammate on the lips. However in actuality, these events did not occur and was only added for audience amusement. As for the historical accuracy of the film, the producers and directors of Remember the Titans did affectively present the issue of racism and discrimination in towns and schools at the time. However when looking at a historical timeline of the events that occurred, the film seemed to be a little off as well. In the film, T.C Williams High School is seen as the first high school in their championship tournament to fully integrate black and whites together in 1971. However in reality, T.C Williams High School saw the integration of white and black students in 1965 where at that point, other schools had also began to integrate sports teams and classes as well. As stated before, even with the racial tension that was present at the time, it was not as bad as what was portrayed in the movie, where people were protesting on the first day of school. All in all, the film Remember the Titans is a well-produced film that keeps you emotionally engaged through the events that occur and the characters that are portrayed. Remember the Titans is definitely a movie to watch that will leave you satisfied, but should also be known that in some cases, the events that occurred are slightly exaggerated and inaccurate."
"This movie is a basic archetype for all other inspirational sports movies. Pride of the Yankees was good but this movie has everything that is an American film. Overcoming prejudice and uniting to become one of the greatest football stories ever told.So many movies have followed the example of this one; Coach Carter, Glory Road, Gridiron Gang, Friday Night Lights, and more recently Pride. All are good in there own way but they seem almost redundant compared to Remember the Titans. Probably one of the best family films of all time and a movie that i have seen probably over a dozen times and can still seen over a dozen more."
"With the Superbowl coming up, I decided to watch Remember The Titans. I knew it was about high school football and dealt with race. It was based on a true story in 1971 which involved integration of both black and white students into one school. I found it quite interesting.Denzel Washington plays Herman Boone. He is brought into the school to replace Bill Yoast (Will Patton) as head coach of the high school football team the Titans. Yoast is upset at first, but then he decides to stay on as defensive coordinator of the Titans, and together these two men find away to get through their differences and bring a football team of both black and white students together as winners. Both give very good performances The young cast is also splendid, especially Wood Harris as Julius and Ryan Hurst as Gerry Bertier. These two are the team captains of the Titans, and they are the first to break through their discrimination against one another and become fast friends. Honorable mention should also be given to Hayden Panettiere as Bill Yoast's young daughter Sheryl.What makes this film work though is how race is not one sided. You see the good and bad from all sides. A recent movie that did just this same thing was Crash from 2005.Now for the bad. There were some things in Remember the Titans that just never quite fit. The character of Ronnie ""Sunshine"" Bass (even though it was a decent performance by Kip Pardue) was one, and all the singing was another. Was Sunshine gay or not? There's one moment where you think it's true, but then afterward it's never really explained. The singing that was used in the movie also went a little too far and distracted somewhat from the movie. Other than that, this was a pretty good film."
"I Recently did a project of this movie during school. The movie was fantastic, and I really enjoyied watching the movie, When we are watching movies, I'm always either throwing paper, or talking. But... NOT THIS TIME! It was a fantastic movie, my eyes were not off the TV, Denzel Washigition played a amazing roll in this film, and so did others. I really enjoyied the movie, I even rented it out of school. This movie is great, it's a high quality drama, that kids off all ages can watch. Some people I know Thought this movie wouldn't be good, because its just about football! No, It had a sensational storyline to the movie, It had times when you could laugh, and also had times when you could almost cry. This movie isn't just about sport, its about the times, when things were hard for everyone. The movie was based on a true story, so all the events were true, You should really rent this movie, I will guarantee you would like it. good movie 8/10"
"This is by far my favorite movie in history. This is the story of two races from two different places putting there differences aside and binding through the great story of football. Even what the parents and the town people told them they would not listen as friendship was to great for them. This movie is feel good with the music to the team comedy. It shows every aspect of racial differences, and how where not all that different. Denzel Washington gives off a breathtaking performance as the coach who never quits and Will Patton who gives up his life long dream to be in the hall of fame to see his team shine. It is a great story of team-work, and should never be forgotten. I give this movie a 10/10. It is the greatest football story ever portrayed."
"Remember the Titans are one of the best movies to come to theaters. Denzel Washington was portrayed as the coach of the only black and white football team in the district. His part in the movie had him under a lot of pressure and he played it real well.My favorite part in the movie was the moment when the football players finally started to play as a team and stop fighting each other for whatever reason. I think this is a great family oriented movie that will stay on the top of the charts and will soon be a classic. Denzel Washington is self explained. It's like whenever he's in a movie, you know its going to be good. I think Remember the Titans is one of the best movies to come around. I've probably seen the movie 50+ times and I still get a warm feeling inside every time I see the scene when they win the championship game and everybody is happy and jumping for joy. Its sometimes brings tears to my eyes."
"This is a very moving and heart lifting film. I am a fan of sports films in general because of the way they lift your spirits and are great if you're looking for the feel good factor. But this film is extra special. It has a fantastic cast (Denzel Washington is amazing in this film) and the way the film deals with the issue of race and how it was dealt with in the 70's is really strong. It has all of the feel good factors of a sports film but manages to deal with important issues along side this. As the film is based on a true story, it makes the storyline and the characters much more identifiable and you really care about what happens to them. I like the way that the film portrays the prejudices of both races. It doesn't focus on one point of view and try to place more blame on one culture. When the boys come together at bootcamp it is incredibly heart warming, in particular the relationship between Julius and Gary. These characters are the ring leaders of the two groups in the film and their union brings the whole team together. They have one of the best film friendships, it seems incredibly genuine. 'left side...strong side.' Another friendship that develops throughout the film is that between Coach Boone and Coach Yoakes. They are never going to be the best of friends but the film follows their journey as they learn to respect one another and learn 'to trust the soul of a man and not just the look of him.' All in all this film is a fantastic sports movie and incredibly touching, so i would strongly recommend it."
"Yakin's sports film about a newly appointed African American coach in a town where racial tension is high as the school team prepares for its first season as a racially integrated unit in contrast to its segregated past. Denzel Washington is absolutely inspiring as Coach herman Boone, while i also enjoyed Will Patton as a white coach who works with. Ryan Hurst, Wood harris, Donald Faison, Ethan Suplee and Ryan Gosling and the rest of the characters that made up the team were all impressive. The film is very charismatic, atmospheric, and enjoyed the sports sequences. Philippe Rousselot's cinematography was great as well as Michael Tronick's editing. The film is directed v ery well by Boaz Yakin and has a perfect screenplay for a sports film from Gregory Allen Howard. This is one of my favorite sports films of all time. ----IMDB rating: 7.4, my rating: 10/10"
"I must admit: I avoided this movie in the theatres, then I avoided renting or seeing this movie. A white boy who's seen enough ""integration"" films that his heart is really hardened to that sort of thing, and really I care little to see any more of this sort of film.Let's be honest, after finishing Remember the Titans tonight -- I was a fool.It's a movie about football, but, to me at least, it was very little about football, and very much about people. It's about one life touching another, and how hard it is to change people, and their outlooks on life, and especially their outlooks on other people, and MORE especially their outlooks on people different than themselves.It would be simple to make a movie about a hardened group of white people who are ""turned"" into more understanding individuals, as if by magic. It would be simple to make each person tolerant, and to watch everyone around them fall like dominoes into this more tolerant attitude. We've all seen it a million times.. This movie doesn't do that.As each person is transformed somewhat into a more enlightened person, they are pulled back by those around them. We see time and again the small respect that grows between the two ""sides"" is torn down. As one person makes strides, their family or loved ones pull them back into their racist ways. It's a struggle clearly defined, and beautifully played in Remember the Titans.I am giving this movie an 8 out of 10. While I did find it striking, and nothing short of enlightening, there were enough of the Hollywood trappings and stereotypes to bring it down a bit for me. Still, there are few movies I have enjoyed more, and none I have enjoyed more that cover this tricky subject."
"Remember the Titans has got to be one of the all time greatest movies that I have ever seen. The movie about T.C. Williams High School, in Virginia, where they are schooling black and white students, and combining the races on the football team, is truly an inspirational story. Coach Boone constantly has to deal with his players fussing with each other over race, but they are able to come together for a perfect season. In the movie, Boone says, ""In Greek Mythology, the Titans were greater than even the gods. Well, that field out there, that's our universe. Let's rule it like Titans."" is truly an incredible inspirational quote from the movie, and I would choose this quote to describe to someone what this movie was about. All in all, this was a great movie, and it is one I would watch several times."
"One of Denzel Washington's best movies thus far! Remember the Titans is awe-inspiring, and will leave you in tears. From looking into the segregation going on in Virginia at the time, to seeing the end result of a community uniting through a football team, this movie is by far the most inspiring movie in years! You'll become familiar with the character's personalities, and you'll feel as if you know a Gary, or a Rev, watch the movie, you'll know! It becomes so real, and you'll feel as if you know the people! It's a must watch, it's hard to describe the impact this movie will have on you and those who watch it! You'll join along on the experience by seeing the racial outlook our society had at that time, and will end with a finale worthy of bringing tears to yours eyes! This is not one of those movies that you'll put away forever. You'll want to pull this movie out over and over from your collection to take a stepback, and to be inspired to become the greatest you can become!"
"Of course, I had seen it before, but to re-watch Remember the Titans on Good Friday was appropriate. Some may call it sacrilegious to compare the resurrection of Jesus to the resurrection of a Virginia town through football, but I see the Easter story in this movie. The self-importance exhibited by the Pharisees and the resulting hatred of those different, was no different from the hate exhibited by the town fathers in Virginia. The insistence of brotherhood by the coach, as played magnificently by Denzel Washington, resulted in a rebirth of the town - a resurrection from the hatred that blinded, and sometimes still blinds, the sons of the Old South. None of us is perfect, but we can all come together and form a perfect society. That was the vision of Jesus and the vision of our forefathers. Remember the Titans reminds us of what we can accomplish if we try - and if we try with love."
"In 1969, there was a survey taken that rated the majority of Americans' opinion of the Ku Klux Klan as being more despicable than the Viet Cong. Yet judging by the inability of many communities of the 1970's to accept integrated schools, such a sentiment would seem hard to believe. I passed up numerous chances to watch this movie, and when I finally saw it on The Disney Channel(of all places), I realized I missed a good one. Boston and Detroit weren't the first battlegrounds for school integration in the 1970's, but even if Alexandria, Virginia wasn't one of them, southern cities were just as hostile towards it as they were in the 1950's and '60's. I had a glowing review planned for this movie until I saw some of the user comments here, and I almost changed my mind.Denzel Washington plays as Herman Boone, an African-American coach, hired on the basis of affirmative action who faces a great deal of resentment for it, especially from former coach Bill Yoast(Will Patton), who is demoted to defensive coach. From the beginning, Boone makes it clear that he's a coach first, and not that much of an activist. Yoast's football-crazed daughter(Hayden Paneittiere), is such an outstanding character, that if this wasn't at least loosely based on a true story, you'd have to make someone like her up.Needless to say, most of the kids don't get along with each other, but Boone is determined to make sure that ends at training camp, and it does, which nearly creates a rift between first string Q.B. Gerry Bertier(Ryan Hurst), and his girlfriend(Kate Bosworth). What we eventually learn is that there's a sinister plot to make sure the integration fails both on the team and at school in general. Boone finds that he can't lose a single game or else he's fired. So, being the determined coach that he is, he wins every single game. However Yoast finds his white friends are plotting to revoke his membership in the local hall of fame if he doesn't agree to let them dump Boone, so they rig the next game.Big Julius(Wood Harris) sounds a great deal like Mr. T when he tells an opposing player, that he'd better get used to being on the ground.As Louie Lastik, Ethan Suplee does a complete 180-degree reversal from his role in ""American History X(1998)"" as a kid from New Jersey who LOVES black culture! This is a kid who knows segregation is stupid and pointless. If he were a kid of anytime since the late-1980's he'd be the kind of kid who drives a pimped-out full-size sedan with huge speakers and chrome dubs.I don't think the movie suggested that Sunshine(Kip Pardue) really was a homosexual, but that his fellow students just taunted him simply because he was such a hippie. Aside from this, I can't really say anything about this movie that hasn't been said before. Even if the events of this movie didn't exactly take place the way the movie depicted, it was still memorable and glorious, clichés or no clichés."
"I don't even like football, but this is one of few football-based movies that I enjoyed.I think this movie deserved an Oscar for the great movie that it is. Based on a true story, ""Remember the Titans"" is a uplifting experience.It begins with a coach of a low-down high school football team. Coach Boone (Denzel Washington) and Coach Yoast (Will Patton) are combining blacks and whites; many people were racist back then, and the coaches wanted to put an end to that.Thanks to hard training, the boys finally made a great team, and that team won the state championship. Earlier, after a previous win, one of the jocks was involved in a fatal car accident. He lived for ten years after that.This is a great movie. Watch it if you like football."
"Not usually a football fan, I rank this well cast and directed dramatic true story as one of my top 10, truly and movingly evoking an era I lived and schools I attended in the 60s-70s, but also with larger, deeper, and timeless themes of human rights, change, and acceptance, that make you think and test your attitudes, while also uplifting with the inspiring power of vision, courage, perseverance, and unity.Youths, adults, and entire cultures clash and make history in the struggle to meld or not to meld, to face and entrench or overcome cultural differences in order to achieve a common goal, and in so doing, also develop interesting new relationships and the discovery of hitherto unknown qualities in themselves against a dramatic backdrop of challenging events including unfairness from trusted adults to dependent youths. ""Let the boys play,"" appeals Coach Herman Boone!Supported with humor, interesting and likable real-life characters and their actors, as well as the classic and alive music of that era, you're transported to a time in America before the 21st Century, when our culture was less jaded and world-weary, with more vitality, vulnerability, jubilance, and depth. As the movie ends I wish I could continue to know these people and experience more of life's twists and turns and ups and downs in their company. You want to watch them continue to grow and see what happens in the lives of people you've come to know. As a result, I've looked up here in the IMDb the movie's writer, director and actors to find more of their movies, especially Ryan Hurst, Kip Pardue, and Hayden Panettiere!(Denzel Washington was already a favorite.)"
"This was a great, great, GREAT Movie! Denzel Washington plays Coach Herman Boone. He was an African-American football coach brought in to be the Head Coach of a recently desegregated Virginia High School back in 1971. Based on true events, there may have been limitations on Artistic License, but this story may not have needed much of that. I laughed, cried, and was so moved by the actors in this film. If, however, I have seen this correctly, I can't believe that this film, nor the actors in this film, were not even nominated for Awards; i.e. Academy Award, Oscar, etc. It did received some (please don't hate me for using this term, I just hadn't heard of these awards) minor awards and nominations, but not the ""Big"" Awards. My feeling is that, the movie itself, Denzel Washington, Will Patton, and many of the other young stars should have been considered with nominations."
"Just few words.. i'm not as much of a crybaby myself and i come from a country with a minimum racism activity.. a though the movie brought tears to my eyes.. somehow the movie seems very unrealistic, beautiful dream we wish to be true one day. It was hard to believe, even though it is just a movie, that bonds of ignorance and prejudice could be broken that easily.. The fact that it's just not possible especially for people living in fear and hate for a longer period of time. Or is the movie telling us something that we don't know and see yet. Is it really possible.. Is it possible that we figure it out one day? The future will reveal the possibilities of that."
"The movie is about racial tension and how a sporting activity can make a difference to change attitudes. It's a movie about friendship, honesty and prejudice. A good movie with good acting performances. The movie is based on a true story where an African American coach is hired to lead a high school football team in a town in Virginia, USA, in the 60's where racial tension still existed. The racial differences accompanies the whole movie, and the audience can see how the friendship that emerges among the team members and their struggle for common goals (to win as a team) can diminish the racial tension among the team members and further on in the hole city. Although one should criticize that the team members become friends to quickly."
"I must say this movie is amazing. I was looking through the cast and could not find who played the older Sheryl Yoast. I am wondering if anybody does know or knows of other movies she is in. Denzel Washington, acting as coach Herman Boone put forth a superb performance which i found to be very believable and motivating. Watching the extras on this DVD was just as good as the film. Being able to listen to the two coaches talk about their experience that year and show their solid friendship was great. I also think it was a very classy move by the school to name the gym after Gary, that guy commands respect and was giving his rightful amount. But mainly, if anybody knows who plays the older Shery, it would be greatly appreciated."
"Highly watchable, yes. It pushes all the right buttons, sure. But I am always so amazed by the seriousness of American sport movies... and the age of their players. Here, what look like thirty year old men compete for their one chance to be great athletes at a boot camp run by a Sergeant major-type coach straight out of the marines. This is life and death and your whole future rolled into one.The only thing is, this is high school. The men are supposed to be seventeen year old boys. The coach is just an ordinary teacher. I think about the school I come from where the teachers have to do unpaid after school sports training for disenfranchised students who often have to be nagged, cornered and marched on to the field to get a complete team together."
"This movie is so good on so many levels. The acting is superb by both Denzel Washington (as Coach Herman Boone) and Will Patton (as Coach Bill Yoast). The movie focuses around the football team of a recently integrated high school in racist Virginia of the 70's. The team battles the heavy racism of the town and overcomes with a spirit that brings the entire town together.The film features more than just the story of a team winning it all with some sort of magical happening as many other sports movies are. This film shows a group of teenagers who can overcome the racism that lives relentlessly in their lives and go on to turn it around and bring the entire town together. The differences between all of the boys on the team are set aside as they instead come together in a way that allows for them to go all the way and win in the face of racism.I highly recommend everyone to see this movie, not because it is just a good movie about football, but because it is a good movie about settling your differences with others. The movie reminded me much of the story of the US hockey team (which was recently made into a film too, also by Disney entitled Miracle). It is a timeless movie that I can still watch and enjoy."
"Remember The Titans is my favorite movie of all time. The main reason why I liked it was because, it showed black and white football players who hated each other at first, but later on they became best friends and an awesome football team! the acting was very well done too, and they really made you care for the characters. those characters were all very interesting and the movie wouldn't have been the same without them. After seeing this movie, and seeing how well Denzel Washington acted, I now want to see more movies with Denzel Washington. That was awesome how this movie really supported the fact that, you don't have to be the same skin color to be best friends! This movie made me laugh and it also touched my heart, I think that if you like to see a well acted football movie with a good plot, and a good meaning to it don't miss Remember The Titans! On a scale of one to ten I give this movie a Ten."
I had never heard of this movie until it was advertised on T.V. and I thought yeah I'll have to watch that and I did and I loved it I taped it then I watched it over and over again but its also a bit sad but its a really great movie for some reason I love all movies with American Football in them and I don't know anything about American football lol! I've never even seen a real game it looks a bit like rugby except in rugby you don't wear those weird armor things or the helmet things anyway back to the movie its a great movie I love how the black and white come together its so cool. So if you haven't seen it I recommend you do!
"I just watched this film this afternoon and boy was I surprised how all it takes is a great story to make such a great film. Stories like this are not made up, they're written in history. Its about a black man (Washington) taking over as coach from a white man (Patton) of a High School back in the early 70's in Alexandria, Virginia. As you can imagine the whites do not take too friendly to this, especially when Patton's character is a championship coach. Denzels task of then trying to make a winning team is clearly hardened as both sides (blacks & whites) of the community are split down the center.But Denzel does more than get the team talking to each other in this heart warming film. He brings the whole community together in Alexandria. Of course this film is about football but the strong theme of racism and how to overpower it really does overshadow this, making it not just enjoyable by sports fans. The story is predictable at times but it's the journey that you go on in the film is what matters.This is a real heart warming story that should leave everyone feeling good at the end, recommended for everyone.8* out 10"
