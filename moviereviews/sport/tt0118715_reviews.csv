"It's actually kind of hard to describe this movie (and what's so great about it) to people who don't already know it and love it; as with many cult films, The Big Lebowski will either speak to you (in which case you will become a fervent follower of His Dudeness and abide by his code for the rest of your life) or, if it doesn't, the film will either leave you completely indifferent or you'll even downright hate it.I believe it's a very funny film and I'm sure it can be rightfully called a comedy, but don't expect punchlines, gags, jokes or slapstick - it's not that kind of comedy. If you want to enjoy this film, you have to meet Jeffery ""The Dude"" Lebowski on his terms, hang out with him and his bowling buddies and follow them at a their (perhaps somewhat leisurely) pace through this weird and unbelievable tale about nihilism, theft (of a car and, more importantly: a Creedence Clearwater Revival tape), kidnapping, abstract art, porn and - of course - bowling. The story is actually kind of simple. You see, some no-good German nihilists urinated on The Dude's rug - and this kind of aggression just won't stand against The Dude. With the help of his bowling buddies, he will do everything in his power to get someone to pay for his rug - or possibly get a new one (because that rug really tied the room together). So he embarks on this worthy quest during which he will encounter many wondrous things and fascinating people (even Jesus - who is NOT the messiah but a very naughty man).With Jeff Bridges in the leading role, the Coen brothers have found the perfect actor to incorporate one of the most iconic characters that has ever been created. But it's not just The Dude that makes this a winner; the whole film is such an inspired folly and simply inventive filmmaking at its finest (the hilarious dream sequence alone is worth the price of admission). The supporting cast is outstanding (J.Turturro, J.Goodman and S.Buscemi among many others), the song choices are perfect and the dialog is the funniest, most quotable in any comedy I've ever seen. This - for me - is without a doubt the film with the highest rewatchability factor of all time. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/"
"The Big Lebowski is the type of movie that is so funny, and so clever, you want nothing more but to meet the Coen brothers, congratulate them personally for their unique talent, and get inside their heads and find out what makes these two geniuses ""tick"".  The main characters are Jeff Bridges (who plays such broad roles like The Muse, The Contender, and Sea Biscuit), John Goodman (who should have won an oscar for best supporting actor for his character, Walter Sobchak)Juliane Moore (Maude Lebowski)and Steve Buscemi (who is unique in every Coen Brother movie).The first time I saw this movie, I will admit that I enjoyed it, but did not fully appreciate its level of humor and raw talent.  I thought the middle section was a bit too depressing and long.  But trust me, this is a movie that gets more funny every time you see it, even if it's your thousandth time seeing it. Its level of comedy, action, brutality, and vulgarity become that much more evident and important.The characters are brilliantly written by the coen brothers, and, likewise, are brilliantly portrayed by the actors.  The Big Lebowski is like no other film.  It will make you laugh and it will make you cry.  There is no other film such as TBL that is sharp and witty all the way through. One of the Joel and Ethan Coen's best, and one of the movie industry's best comedic film of all time.  You want to go see this flick."
"It's a travesty that most critics only read The Big Lebowski at its most superficial level and called it a modern take on a Raymond Chandler potboiler. I simply can't begin to perceive how one could sit down in front of this cinematic pop-poetry, as it plates gold on the silver screen, and not feel so incredibly alive. The dream sequence Busbee Berkley musical numbers are unique and awe-inspiring; the humor is rich, subtle, and clever in the way it satirizes politically correct arrogance; the free-flowing story avoids (even pokes fun at) nonessentials like plot points and pay-offs. But what really makes this film such a masterpiece, such a panacea, is the incredible humanism, the care that the Coen brothers put in developing The Dude (Jeff Bridges), Walter (John Goodman), Donnie (Steve Buscemi-tremendously endearing), and Brandt (magnificently played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman). Looking at the films use of Sam Elliott to play The Stranger, who constantly rambles about the many wonders of The Dude (among other things), it is clear that the film is an ode to a Dudist way of life. And in a time where so many film promise that they have the answer to the worlds problems and end up as slick, stylistic show-off films, what more could one ask for than a good-hearted film like this? Not to mention the performance by Jeff Bridges, which ranks among the best performances of the nineties; he has a relaxed slouch, a goofy smile, an enthusiastic dance, and his buttons can only be pushed by Walter, who John Goodman plays with charm and fury. The Coen brothers have always been considered 'cold' filmmakers, but there is nothing here but warmth and humanity (as is the case with the Coens' Fargo). What we have here is one of the greatest achievements in modern cinema and if you can't see that, grab a White Russian, hit the bowling ally, and find your inner-Dude as soon as possible."
"My favourite Coen brothers movie changes over the years as I watch and rewatch their amazingly original and consistently surprising oeuvre. When I first saw 'The Big Lebowski' on its original release I enjoyed it but thought it was a bit of a slight ""fun"" movie with less depth than many of their previous works. Now, a few years and several viewing later, I have come to realise just how accomplished a movie it is, and it has become one of my all time favourite movies. Other film makers have attempted to weave together various genres, styles and images in a similarly eclectic, postmodern fashion, but few do it as seamlessly and with such wit as Ethan and Joel Coen. 'The Big Lewboski' is an extremely smart film, but it doesn't shout ""look at me! Aren't I clever?"". It sucks you in from the get go, and bottom line it is FUNNY, and as it is a comedy that's what counts the most! Everything about the movie is perfect, the script, the direction, set design, costumes, and the wonderful soundtrack (one of the most brilliant ever assembled, it includes lesser known Dylan and Elvis Costello numbers, Creedence classics, and songs from cult favourites like Yma Sumac, Captain Beefheart, Moondog, Esquivel and garage gods The Monks). Plus of course the actors, who are well cast and virtually flawless. Jeff Bridges ('Fat City', 'Starman') IS The Dude, and it's impossible to think of anyone else acting the role. Coen regulars John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, John Turturro, Peter Stomare, and Jon Polito are all on board, as well as Julianne Moore ('Boogie Nights'), David Huddleston ('Capricorn One'), Philip Seymour Hoffman ('Magnolia') and Sam Elliot ('Mask'), even surprise cameos from Ben Gazzara ('The Killing Of A Chinese Bookie') and singer Jimmie Ray Gilmore. I can't fault 'The Big Lebowski', it is one of the most original and entertaining comedies ever made and a genuine modern classic. It's movies like this that keep me watching despite the endless mountain of mindless garbage that Hollywood continually spews out. If only every movie in the box office Top Ten was as inspired and amusing as this one!"
"Those Coen brothers have an ear for language. You feel it in the sing-songy banalities of Fargo, and in the noiresque machine-gun dialogue of Miller's Crossing, but neither of these can prepare you for the feast for the ears that is The Big Lebowski.Channeling the opaque mysteries of Raymond Chandler, the Coens throw LA resident bum and Bowling aficionado Jeff Lebowski (""The Dude"" to his friends) into a strange triple-crossing case of kidnapping, ransoms, nihilists and urinated-upon rugs. It is the equivalent of throwing unrelenting forces at an immovable object, the Dude's bemused stoicism at constant odds with the world around him. He'd much rather be bowling with crazed Vietnam Vet Walter (John Goodman) and pure silent soul Donnie (Steve Buscemi).As with so much of the Coens' output, style is more than half the point: not just visual, though ace DP Roger Deakins paints an alluring canvas, but tonal and auditory. This is an insanely funny head-trip of a movie, with wonderfully idiosyncratic characters, down to the smallest part. Who better than the Coens to reinvent the comedy of errors?This is without a doubt one of their very best, a personal favorite, an unmissable film and the kind of experience that will plant an indelible smile on your face. Do yourself and see this now, if you haven't already."
"With the combination of the writing of the Coen brothers and the Cinematography of Roger Deakins, they created a film as beautiful as it is funny. The Coen brothers consistently impress me with their ability to write an interesting story with fascinating yet quirky characters. Without resorting to gratuitous sexual scenes like many other writer/directors of R rated films the Coen brothers manage to add the right amount of language and violence that is necessary to the story without it becoming the only reason for watching. 'The Big Lebowski' has so many clever and hilarious lines that you have to watch it over and over again. Nothing else needs to be said about it other than it is the greatest movie ever made."
"No movie has entertained me more in the last year than this film. It's delightfully written, directed with poise and acted with extravagance and excellence. I do admit that this is a film that I had to see six times to get. Every time I watch it I learn something new. The genius of the film lies within a game I think the Coen brothers play with their audiences. There are the touches of the masters in many of their films. In ""The Hudsucker Proxy,"" it was Preston Sturges and Frank Capra. In ""Raising Arizona,"" I felt a touch of Sam Fuller. In this film, I felt many touches of greatness, but more specifically I felt John Sayles or even John Cassevettes in spots. The camera was manipulated beautifully and I felt a tinge of their talents lurking in at many a turn. The performances are astounding, especially Goodman as the deranged bowler still living deep within the jungles of the Vietcong. Huddleston is also quite wonderful as the title character. Turturro gives a fine cameo as ""Jesus,"" coupled with a rousing and humurous version of the Eagles, ""Hotel California,"" done in Espanol. I hope this is a film that is looked at with more seriousness. It is, once you dig deep, a fine piece of filmmaking."
"How mysterious certain films can be. They become addictive. I've seen Lebowski at least a dozen time and most of the times by accident. It was on TV or a friend is watching it and it is enough to catch a glimpse to be hooked, completely hooked. Last night I saw it on purpose with a couple of friends and I think I'm stating to realize what is it - A unique combination of talents all looking in the same direction --- The Coen Brothers are, probably, the only ones who know what they are seeing and the rest just trust their vision. Totally. Jeff Bridges is miraculous. His character is unique, never seen and at the same times is all of Bridges characters put together. I love him in this part and I love the Coen brothers for writing it knowing, I'm sure, that Bridges was going to give it that real, totally real surreal kind of life. Philip Seymour Hoffman, comes in to do what he does best, being memorable and then, of course, John Tarturro, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, delicious, each one of them - I'm pretty sure The Big Lebowski will be around for centuries and it will always have something to say even if we don't know exactly what."
"The Coen brothers are up there with my very favorite filmmakers (Scorsese, Kubrick, Carpenter).  I am very fond of their work.  Throughout their irreverent career, they have explored different subjects and themes.  Their best stories evolve from  kidnapping schemes in films like ""Raising Arizona "" and ""Fargo"", one of my very favorites.  I thought that film was fervently free.  I was so ever wrong. It's as if the Coen Brothers have celebrated their complete breakthrough success (Academy Award winners), and now are willing to do whatever they please.  ""The Big Lebowski"" is a film so meandering, so wonderfully novel, that I found myself missing the many other sporadic jokes as I was heaving from laughter.  The film is basically about mistaken identity, eccentric characters, and a soiled rug.  This film extols the bowler, the allies, even the pins.  We experience an actual bowling ball POV, as the Dude (Jeff Bridges) hallucinates.  This film has nihilists, feminists, millionares, paedophiles, drugged out hippies, underachieving students, incompetent criminals, pornographers and 'Nam veterans.  This movie is open to anything , anything... Some people are turned off by absurd looniness, because it's so grandiosely different.  Yet who couldn't chuckle, if not explode, when a bowler dressed in a tight purple suit licks a bowling ball's finger hole, and the camera pans down to reveal his name as Jesus! I will disclose no more, but urgently recommend you to traverse to your nearest video abode and rent this true escapists' feature. Abandon all solemn inhibitons, though!  One can not keep a straight face whilst watching."
"I'd heard a lot of bad press about this movie. Not as good as Fargo, was a much used phrase. I wasn't overly impressed with Fargo, the atmosphere just didn't click for me, but anyway, that made me a little apprehensive about this.It's easily better than Fargo, IMHO, and it's right up there with Barton Fink or Miller's Crossing. A true comedy classic with so many memorable lines and characters, but it's the movie's atmosphere which is so truly joyous, a wonderful celebration of basically doing nothing. Achieving one's goals is important, yes, but it's okay to set them low, is what I perceived this movie to be saying. As long as one is basically a good guy, then that's enough. Well, that's what it seemed like to me, and it was expressed so beautifully in the stunning cast of grotesques, lovely music ( although more Burwell would have been nice ), and the trippiest, funniest, most absurd dream sequences you've ever seen. Great stuff."
"The Coen brothers (Joel and Ethan) are the most innovative and, perhaps, the best filmmakers working today. Or they at least rank along side the likes of Martin Scorsese and rising director star Quentin Tarantino. Think about it: ""Blood Simple"" was the best film of 1984; ""Raising Arizona"" was the best film of 1987; ""Miller's Crossing"" was the best movie of 1990; ""Barton Fink"" was the best movie of 1991; and ""Fargo"" was the best movie of 1996. Now comes their latest effort, ""The Big Lebowski,"" which, while it isn't in quite the same league as the above films, is still one of the most thoroughly entertaining movies of 1998.It tells the shambling story of a man named Jeff Lebowski, who calls himself The Dude (Jeff Bridges). The Dude's apartment gets broken into and a thief urinates on his rug. He finds out that the criminals were not looking for him, but looking for the OTHER Jeff Lebowski, the disabled millionaire (played by David Huddleston). That's all I can tell you. The rest is really too bizarre and complicated to put into words; but it's bizarre and complicated in the best ways of the words.Still, what I'll remember most about ""The Big Lebowski"" is the outstanding number of utterly terrific performances. Bridges delivers the best performance of his career and probably the best of the year as a bum lie-about who just wants to be left alone. John Goodman is the real comic gem here as the forever-loudmouthed Walter, The Dude's bowling partner and best friend. Steve Buscemi co-stars as the dimwitted, bug-eyed Donny, the third bowling partner; there's a small but interestingly offbeat spot for Julianne Moore; and John Torturro stops in, as Jesus the bowler, for what is probably the best walk-on performance in years. If you are a Coen brothers fan or like humor that is distinctly offbeat, you have found your movie. As a rather avid moviegoer, I found the film to be a great excersise in pointless extremeties and respectable raunch. Rated R. 117 minutes. 10 out of 10."
"Acting is one of the most key elements to success or failure of a film. Some film types can survive without superb acting. These motion pictures can entertain the viewer with special effects or intense action scenes. A film based on heavy dialog and back-story can not survive with out excellent actors. One such movie that meets the dialog-based criterion is The Big Lebowski. The film follows Jeff 'The Dude' Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) and his two close friends through a not so normal chain of events. The story is augmented by the supporting characters Walter (John Goodman) and Donny (Steve Buscemi). Written by Joel and Ethan Coen, the creative forces behind Fargo, the intriguing story succeeds because of the actors' impeccable skill. As with many other films by the Coen brothers The Big Lebowski is an odd array of out of the ordinary characters slapped right in the middle of an improbable situation. The Dude is an unlikely hero living in the city of Los Angeles who becomes embroiled in a botched kidnapping. This is not the average kidnapper comedy that has been seen a thousand times before. The Coen brothers take a fresh look at an old tired subject. The story they have created is intriguing and entertaining, but the true entertainment comes from the unique characters. Walter, played by John Goodman, is a Vietnam veteran who seems to have some parts of post traumatic stress syndrome. Donny, another one of The Dude's close friends, is a quiet unassuming character who often interjects into conversation, but no one pays close attention to what he says.As well as these characters are written, they would not be as effective had they been played by other actors. This effectiveness of acting can be seen in the opening scene at the bowling alley where the supporting characters are first introduced. This scene is comprised of Donny, Walter, and The Dude sitting at their lane in the bowling alley discussing the attack on The Dude by some hired thugs (7min 25 sec). The Dude is approaching the situation in his usual lackadaisical way. Jeff Bridges conveys The Dude's overall demeanor in his laid back, sauntering, walk. Although being laid back, Bridges is direct in his speaking showing that The Dude is not the average confused old stoner. Bridges facial expressions during this scene show The Dude is distressed about the loss of his rug which 'tied the room together.'Donny seems to be an outside observer in this scene and throughout much of the film. Buscemi conveys his character's attention during discussion by following the flow of the conversation with his head. He looks from The Dude to Walter and from Walter to The Dude depending on who is talking. He may seem to be paying attention, but his asking of simple questions dispels this assumption. Another technique Buscemi uses is while he is observing the conversation he furrows his brow as if in deep thought and contemplation. This look of concentration is juxtaposed with the look of confused happiness, an empty smile, Buscemi uses when Donny makes a point in the conversation. These techniques which are introduced by Bridges and Buscemi early in the film are used throughout the entire picture. Although Bridges and Buscemi do an excellent job of introducing their characters traits to the viewer, Goodman superbly shows his character's inner traits. Throughout the conversation it is apparent due to dialog that Walter is becoming upset. Goodman conveys this anger with facial expressions and body movement. In the early part of the conversation Goodman puts on a stone face to show that Walter is firmly set in his position. The Dude begins to agitate Walter as the conversation continues. Goodman shows this agitation by furrowing his brow, leaning forward while talking, and turning progressively redder. As Goodman continues, his speaking becomes more staccato and flustered. When The Dude refers to one of the attackers as 'the china man,' Walter continues on his tirade momentarily then quietly addresses the non politically correct nature of The Dude's comment. Changing from this aggravated manner of speaking to a more politically correct and lower tone shows that Walter has some sudden mood swings and a short fuse, as he returns to his tirade quickly. This scene exemplifies the acting skills of John Goodman, Jeff Bridges, and Steve Buscemi. The characters in this story have been given interesting and entertaining dialog by the writers, but it is up to the actors to make the characters exude a certain feeling or trait. In each of their roles the three main actors add a level of feeling to the characters that is lacking from many of the offerings of the dark comedy genre. Goodman's portrayal of Walter as the 'know it all' with a short fuse is downright hilarious. Jeff Bridges steps out of his usually serious persona to portray a character as laid back as they come, 'quite possibly the laziest in Los Angeles county.' Steve Buscemi is as entertaining as ever. His depiction of Donny, the character to rarely speak, adds depth to an otherwise bland side character. After viewing this film one can see why actors who can actually practice their craft are worth their weight in gold."
"The Coen Brothers did it again! Just when I had lost my hope of seeing a new, GOOD, American movie, I went to see this. It absolutely blew my mind! Now I've seen all the Coen-films, and I'd have to say that this is one of the very best. It's about this guy, ""The Dude"", excellently played by Jeff Bridges, who gets an unexpected visit from two thugs who soil his carpet. This event triggers a kidnapping-drama, filled with black humor and crazy characters. I'd recommend this film to everyone with an open mind and a twisted sense of humor. Perhaps thats why I liked it so much."
"Certain movies you can sort of understand why they are cult classics, other films such as this one, seem to be funny and intelligent because someone said it was funny and intelligent and therefore must be funny and intelligent.I suppose you could find deeper meaning in this, or perhaps the meaning was right there on the surface. But like many of the Coen Brothers films that I have watched I either like them or I don't.The ones that I liked usually have a strong story behind them, the ones that I don't like seem to be more of a ""day in the life of"" story about people who really don't seem to matter and about events that no one really cares about.Maybe there is some type of amusement in trivial matters, making bored college frat boys feel more intelligent then they really are, but I need something deeper for intellectual stimulation.For my comedy, I don't need slapstick or pie in the face humor to make me laugh. Cynicism, witty dialogue, sarcasm, commentary and so on, not one line random events that happen out of no where with no real context and then expected to be funny.(which is not to say that slapstick pie in the face humor doesn't make me laugh at times...) A very random film with very to little no substance to it. A few quirky one liners here and there, but in all honesty I was more looking at the clock waiting for this film to end then I was looking at the film waiting for it to be entertaining.Yet for some reason it has a cult following and there it is... However one should keep in mind that cults generally comprise of brainwashed individuals who really can't think for themselves anyways and generally follow wherever they are pointed to like mindless sheople..."
"Honestly a laugh-out-loud comedy that I agree with others, does not get old! The bowling scenes crack me up. Steve Buscemi is hilarious in this and of course Jeff Bridges. There are just moments of sheer comedic cringe-worthy moments that will have you in stitches. Check it out!"
"I like non-main stream flicks - Blue Velvet, Boxing Helena, and so on. I like comedy that is not dependent on stupid sight gags or scatological humor. This movie had been out for a few years before I watched it. It was, I had heard, a gem that was waiting for me. I had looked forward to it greatly.I didn't find any aspect of the movie funny, other than the enigma that it's well liked by many.I suppose this is where I differ from most - I don't find a guy walking around with a mixed drink all the time funny. I don't find Dan Conner overreaching as a guy who is a Vietnam vet freaking out about anything funny, particularly because that's been done before. I don't find the Italian guy acting fooling while bowling to be funny. I don't find referencing a guy as ""the dude,"" with article obligatory, to be funny. And on and on. What's funny? Dennis Miller. He's funny. George Carlin. He's funny. The Big Lebowski - not funny.I really don't have any comment on the ins and outs of the movie. Just not funny, and, given that it's a comedy, that, to me, is a fatal mistake."
"Spoilers ahead.I frankly do not understand why ""The Big Lebowski"" has been elevated to the point of being considered one of the best cult classics of all-time. Why this cult around the character of ""The Dude"", one of the blandest, flavorless, most uninteresting comedy protagonists ever to be put on celluloid? He's simply some dopey hippie who loves to hang around a John Goodman cardboard-cutout Vietnam vet gone loco (real Vets should raise their fists in anger over such an overdone, unfunny, disrespectful and insulting characterization) and a seldomly-seen Steve Buscemi, who doesn't really do much. The plot winds into so many different twists and turns and includes so many supporting characters, all of whom seek The Dude's bag of money, that trying to understand this movie is like trying to untangle the Gordian Knot by hand. What's the point of placing layer upon layer upon layer of weird, uninteresting characters to the point that you forget what the hell this movie is about? Nihilist German rockers? Some sicko Hugh Hefner clone? A gorgeous yet incomprehensible avant-garde artist who wants to have ""The Dude's"" baby? A strange drugstore cowboy who serves as some sort of Greek chorus? Stop it! ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"" had an array of weird characters, but it succeeded because it had a straightforward plot and brilliant acting and writing. The Coen's monstrosity has little wit or signs of superb comic writing, and all of their characters, though weird, are totally boring and flavorless. For weird characters to work, they must act totally off-the-wall and twisted beyond realism. The weirdos in ""Lebowski"" are actually regular, and seem like a mish-mash of all-too-real rejects from a yuppie coffee bar.Who likes this stuff? I have just seen ""No Country for Old Men"", and, like ""Lebowski"", that was poorly written in terms of a smooth plot; and, like ""Lebowski"", lacked any interesting characters. I'll give ""Fargo"" a chance; otherwise, the Coen Brothers ain't reeling me in with their weird, clunky movies."
"Absolutely unwatchable. Tried it twice, figuring one attempt wasn't sufficient.I am not offended by vulgar language, but when it is such a major portion of the dialogue, it had better be with good reason and to great effect. Neither is the case, here.These characters are the types of people that normal people with lives pass by numerous times a day without taking any notice. There is a reason for that. Folks like that are uninspiring, dull, and generally useless to the world they inhabit. Centering a movie script on them is going to make you a dolt or a genius, depending how sycophantic your fan base is. It seems too many people checked their good judgment at the door - not only giving this movie a free pass, but pumping up the votes to the extent that this turd rates in the Top 250. Whoa geez.Again, I say, ""Absolutely unwatchable."""
"the title sounded funny. Actors: Julianne Moore, Jeff bridges. OK, at first glance it looked promising. I really thought that I was going to have such a great time watching a comedy movie with great actors.This movie has the great rating, the prominent actors that I much enjoy watch in many of their great performances... It seemed that it automatically was going to be a great comedy. so, I sat there waiting and waiting for the next great scene that never came up:-( I just felt that I wanted to laugh, but could not... needless to say, I did not get this movie...all the topics were funny but did not click together: the rug? The same name? The unusual nickname? The kidnapping of the girl? I mean... Jeff bridges and Julianne Moore can do way much better. I would not have waisted my time..."
"Looks like while making ""The Big Lebowski"" (1998)– weird, nutty, outrageously funny and deliciously twisted movie, the brothers Ethan and Joel Coens, known for their unique and dry humor, sat back, laughed out loud, and had fun. ""Big Lebowski"" turned as one of the funniest comedies ever made. It is funny because of the incredibly off-beat characters, their weirdness, flaws, their interactions, the surreal situations they found themselves in, and perfectly written and delivered hilarious dialogs. There is the story, of course, which is based on the case of mistaken identity with the following kidnapping, villainous nihilists, vanguard erotic flying painter, the bowler named Jesus but the story is truly secondary to the delicious craziness of the movie.Some reviewers call Big Lebowski misfire and deranged mess, saying that the story is convoluted with the characters we would not care about a bit. It was also interesting to read the reviews that were written upon its release and compared it to Coens' ""Fargo"" that had been made a year earlier than the adventure of Jeffrey ""the Dude"" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges).""Fargo"" could be Coens' masterwork but it does not make Lebowski any worse. It was dismissed as the inferior film and was predicted not to stand the future re-watch. The time has proved the predictions wrong. ""The Dude"" Lebowski - middle-aged pot smoking, White Russian drinking, bowling enthusiast ex-hippie, and his friends, Polish Catholic converted Jew, ""more Jewish than Tevye"" Vietnam veteran Walter with anger management problems (John Goodman) and timid, little slow, ""sweet prince"" Donny (unusually quiet Steve Buscemi) have become the cult figures, the beloved characters, for millions of film lovers of different generations, not only the baby- boomers.The Coen Brothers have made twenty films, and all of them are treasure, including their contribution in the 2006 anthology, Paris, je t'aime. I've seen all their films and I want to repeat the title of my review on their latest, ""Burn after reading"" - The Coen Brothers don't make bad movies, because they don't know how. Their films, Including the cult favorite, Big Lebowski, should not be missed. They are clever, darkly funny, and beautiful without being pretty pictures. In short, they are first class entertainment."
"This film was supposed to be a comedy, and I admit that the very last scene was funny, but the rest of the film had no humor. The tremendous dependence on a single expletive and its many forms became dull and boring after the first five minutes during which it was used about 100 times. The two scenes in which a topless woman appeared were obviously inserted just so she could be shown, but there was no point other than that one. The scene in which a Corvette was destroyed was completely predictable, and it unfolded in a strange way, and then faded away.Julianna Moore was the best part of the film, and Joe Pesci's talents were wasted on a trivial part for which he clearly had no enthusiasm.Jeff Bridges practiced in his role for his academy award as the character was identical.Once again, Hollywood insists that all drug usage is good, lack of moral character is good, drinking is good, and being a bum is good if you have a heart of gold.The film was long, too."
"I recently saw an interview with Jeff Bridges where he commented that he has become personally identified with ""The Dude,"" the character he plays in this movie. He also noted that ""The Big Lebowski"" has developed a cult following. The interviewer added some praise. That, together with the high rating on IMDb, convinced me to give this a shot. Early on I realized that the story was not to be taken seriously. This movie is a series of loosely connected comedy sketches (well, some hardly connected at all). The result is an absurdest comedy that had very few laughs for me.I did not find The Dude at all appealing as a person. How much is there to admire in someone whose life goals seem to be bowling and drinking white Russians? I do give Bridges credit for inhabiting the role. John Goodman's character really grated on me--his passions seem to be bowling and the f word. The positives: the scenes with John Turturro gave me some laughs; the scenes filmed from within a bowling ball were an interesting curiosity; some non sequiturs were worth a few chuckles.I guess one person's humor is another person's tedium. I found this movie to be tedious."
"I'd been nagged by friends and colleagues for years to watch this movie, face-palms all around - they couldn't believe I hadn't seen one of the best movies of all time.I have a 30min rule for movies, if it's rubbish I turn it off to avoid wasting my life on a bad movie. As this one came with such a high regard, I gave it a full hour and then was forced to turned it off.Don't ask me how it ended, it was so dull and boring I really don't care. It was slow, I found myself falling asleep and I've never before watched a comedy with no laughs. Reading the other reviews, I wonder if we were watching the same movie.I watched ""Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li"" earlier this year just for fun as it had such poor reviews and ratings. Sadly I enjoyed it more than this ""classic"". Whoever invented the ""dark comedy"" genre should be put against a wall and shot."
"How can anyone not dig The Dude? In a world where energetic go-getters are idolised and looked up to, it's nice to know that there are fat, indolent, scruffy, pot smoking, beer drinking bums out there taking it easy. Or they would be if people would leave their rugs alone The Big Lebowski is a film where the plot is entirely inconsequential; it doesn't matter. It's just a mere device to set The Dude on his way. The joy is in watching him interact with all the weirdos in Los Angeles and in listening to the dialogue  the script is the most quotable since Withnail and I. Therefore it's the perfect film to just sit back and absorb.Picking a favourite scene in a film that is jam packed with great moments and wonderful lines of dialogue is a near impossibility, but you'd be hard pressed to beat the scene with the Malibu police chief. ""I don't like your jerk-off name. I don't like your jerk-off face. I don't like your jerk-off behaviour. And I don't like youjerk-off."" And then to cap it off he throws his mug at The Dude's head. Brilliant! And making it even funnier is the scene that immediately follows it where the taxi driver throws The Dude out of his cab.But another favourite is Jesus. He only has two scenes but both are hilarious. (I hope the Coens make 'The Passion of the Jesus.') And I love the flashback where you see him knocking on doors to tell his neighbours that he's a pederast. Especially good is the way that a large, bearded man with a dirty shirt answers the door (I always crack up at the breath Jesus takes when he sees the man  I also noticed, for the first time, that Jesus in that flashback is visibly showing in his tight jeans; he's not a small guy).But then there's the scene where The Dude first meets Maude Lebowski (excellently played by Julianne Moore). ""I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but"" And I also like the little dig at the porno film they're watching: ""The plot is ludicrous."" But the comment isn't really aimed at the porno film; the film is talking about itself. It knows the plot is nonsensical but it also knows that it doesn't matter  it's best to just let it wash over you.Mentioning porno has reminded me of Jackie Treehorn. Is there a better visual gag in modern cinema than The Dude scratching a notepad for a message or telephone number only to find a cartoon of a man with a gigantic erection? Well, maybe there is, because even earlier in the film there's the moment where The Dude spends a long time making a homemade device to keep intruders out only for him to forget the fact that his door opens outwards instead of inwards  he nails a bit of wood to the floor, props a chair up to the door handle to keep people out and the very second he walks away, the door opens and the chair comes tumbling down. Pure genius! And Jackie Treehorn's brainless goons are brilliant too. ""You're not dealing with morons here."" Oh yes we are. But the film's all the better for it.But I'm not sure what my favourite line in the film would be  again it's almost impossible to pick just one. But ""I still jerk-off manually"" would have to be up there, as would virtually every line Walter spews (""The Chinaman is not the issue""). However, if I was forced (at gunpoint) to choose, I'd have to go with a piece of Dude wisdom: ""Fortunately, I'm adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regiment to keep my mind, you know, uh, limber."" And The Dude's reaction when Maude tells him that she's trying to conceive is magnificent.Yet another brilliant scene is the Larry scene. Walter and The Dude are trying to get information out of some kid but the kid just stares impassively at them, so Walter destroys his car  or what he thinks is his car. Now at this moment I could quote the real dialogue, but the TV version dialogue is perhaps even better. ""Do you see what happens, Larry? Do you see what happens when you find a stranger in the Alps?"" It's even better than: ""Fun you, melon farmer!"" Then there are the nihilists. ""We believe in nothing, Lebowski. Nothing. And tomorrow we come back and we cut off your johnson."" But try as they might to intimidate, the only scary thing about the nihilists is the techno music they listen to. Well, that and their obsession with the male member.But I could quote lines from The Big Lewbowski all day. I just dig the film so much because it puts a goofy grin on my face; its stupidity is remarkably intelligent. Plus, in the end, it's actually quite heartfelt  if the film's about anything, it's about friendshipwell, that and smoking pot, drinking beer, bowling and keeping hold of your johnson. Yeah, the world's a better place with The Dude in it."
"The Coen's most endearing film perhaps, the Big Lebowski was unappreciated upon release but since has garnered a massive following. Jeff Bridges plays the ultimate slacker- Dude whose sole purpose in life is to laze around in his room smoking pot or go bowling with his strange friends- a militant gun lover played by John Goodman and a meek fellow portrayed by Steve Buscemi. One day he is mistaken for another man (a very wealthy man) with the same name by a batch of inept crooks who take his rug forcefully. What follows is a bizarre, offbeat tale of mistaken identity and revenge. This is a typical offbeat Coen's film ably supported by Julianne Moore who, for once, chooses to tackle a funny role (and has a hilariously surreal dance sequence with Bridges)."
"I have just written one review, but this awful movie deserves one. This is absolutely incredible, but seems that lots of people liked it! I did not found anything funny in it, nor action, nor story, nor the way the story is told, nor the script that is horrible. This is a flat movie without any depth, the most superficial movie I have ever seen. You simply can't find any knowledge nor inspiration, nor entertainment in it. It is a great black hole, you'll only spend time watching it. There is no way to found something interesting in this movie. Except some seconds in a bowling scene, I can't find any interesting point of interest in this movie. And the hilarious part is that it was recommended to me by two friends of mine. There is something wrong in this world that I am not aware about."
"It's hard to pick out one line of dialogue in particular for two reasons. One-almost everything said in this film is downright hilarious. And Two-the F word is spoken 281 times so there's not many sentences that don't contain it. 144 sentences also end in 'man'.Jeff 'The Dude' Lebowski is a man living a minimalistic existence. He has no job, no ambitions and no worries. His days, be they weekdays or weekends, are spent bowling, driving around or having the occasional acid flashback. His pals are Walter Sobchak, a security expert and half-crazed Vietnam vet and Donny, a humble, mousy little man who is left out of almost every conversation.The Dude is happy with his easy-going life of nothingness until two thugs ambush him in his house believing him to the OTHER Jeff 'The Big' Lebowski, the millionaire with a trouble-making wife who owes money all over town. These thugs are none too happy with their dumb error and re-assert themselves by peeing on The Dude's rug.This very much displeases The Dude as this rug really tied the room together and since he cannot track down the 'Chinaman' thug responsible he decides to take it out of the Big Lebowski, as it's now HIM who owes a new rug. The Dude is welcomed into the Big Lebowski's mansion by Brandt the butler, a man so appallingly sycophantic he'd make Weylon Smither's look bad. But his millionaire namesake is not so ready and willing to give hand-outs and basically tells The Dude to get lost.At this point things become quite complicated as a bunch of ex-pop star Nihilist thugs, a powerful pornographer, a dejected feminist daughter, a Brother Seamus (NOT an Irish Monk), a joyriding teenager, a revolting pederast champion bowler, Saddam Hussein, a mysterious cowboy and a doctor who is insistent on him removing his shorts all make The Dude's life suddenly a helluva lot more interesting. The plot thickens and thickens and the dude is dragged to dozens of different places across LA, going from limo to limo, never too far from a white Russian or a doobie.There are zillions of idiosyncrasies in this film that keeps it new and interesting every time you watch it. Every scene and every line of dialogue is so memorable that, like me, you'll be acting the film out for years. Even on a 100th viewing you'll notice dramatic ironies, character arcs and ingenious wordplay that went right over your head before.The acting is superb. I am a fan of Jeff Bridges but he completely disappears in this film. He truly BECOMES The Dude and shows little of his recognisable self. John Goodman, in probably the most under-rated role of his career, is the world's angriest man. Bringing frustration and smart-ass arrogance to every scene (though he's almost always right). Set well over a decade after 'nam (and during the first Gulf conflict) Walter seems to be suffering from perpetual, ever-lasting post-traumatic stress syndrome as he blows up in any situation. Take a look at his 'minor' confrontation with Smokey for example.It's not about plot, or even characters. It's about a certain moment in time, the early 90s. And the definitive man of that time was the Dude. The rug-peeing just happened to occur simultaneously."
"TBL is not a terrible movie, but I apparently just don't get it. My lady-friend's daughter is always telling her that she should see TBL in order to understand some of the ""in-humor"" and comments of her generation. I kept telling my friend that I really didn't think that the movie would be what she expected, but we watched it together anyway. (I had already seen it a couple times.) My friend was flabbergasted, as she couldn't identify any phrases, humorous scenes, or references that she had ever heard or seen her daughter's group use. She didn't like the movie, either, and was actually checking to make sure that it was the same movie her daughter had recommended.I feel the same way. Frankly, this movie is boring and pretentious. I love most of the Coens' work, but not this film. It goes into a category, along with ""Young Frankenstein"", of movies about which other people make a fuss and I just don't get. Maybe I'm slow.Anyway, if your idea of fun is watching a laid-back dude drink White Russians and a lot of unnecessary one-dimensional characters get layered on, go ahead. It's just not my cup of tea."
"This movie is not funny, it is not memorable, and it is not enjoyable. It's a story that reads like it was written by some pinhead with ADD who heavily self-medicates with marijuana; a ridiculous amount of random things happened for no damn discernible reason or even a more than tenuous connection between them. I am a charter member of the Jeff Bridges Fan Club and the way he was wasted was nearly criminal, and the same goes for Steve Buscemi. The movie needed a lot less John Goodman and a lot more John Turturro. It feels like some film student decided to ape the Coen brothers. If i hadn't rented this movie for free with a coupon, i would feel totally ripped off. Something about the movie made me dodge it when it came out, and all the years since, but i finally decided to fill in a gap in my Coen brothers movie track, and now i'm sorry. I blame all of you jerks."
"Why the heck did I tell you the Big Lebowski is not funny three times? Because this is once for every 50 people that told me this movie was the funniest most entertaining movie EVER. After years of being berated at parties and get-togethers with people spewing line after line from the movie, I gave in last week and rented it. Wow.It's so bad on so many levels it's hard to describe. Let me be very very clear: It's not funny. At all. It's mildly amusing in parts but of the six people I watched it with, no one laughed once. Not once. I don't think it's a spoiler to tell you the language is sickeningly bad. Up there with Team America bad. Like Scarface bad. There is one reason and one reason only that this movie is popular: College aged men (or guys who wish they were college aged) own the DVD and watch it repeatedly. After watching the movie once (and not laughing), they then watch it repeatedly memorizing the movie. They sit around the DVD owner's sectional couch elbowing each other before each ""big"" scene almost spilling their friend's beer and yelling, ""HERE IT IS! HERE IT IS! HE""S GONNA SAY IT!"" They then laugh at how clever they are. They're part of ""The DUDE"" club and they are very, very special indeed.This is the most unfunny movie I have ever seen. Other than Scarface and Team America, the movie contains the foulest most unnecessary language I've ever heard in a movie, and overall is one of top five worst movies I've ever seen (and yes, this includes You Tube cat movies)."
"This is just a long boring crime movie with no mystery and fewer jokes. This movie has no more comical moments than any other ""action"" movie. Jeff Bridges is not a comedian nor funny, and is insolent in his satire. He is just another terrible actor riding his parents coattails. The Coen Brother are also not comic writers, frankly, they are the definition of overrated. Writing long boring movies isn't being deep, it's writing long boring movies. This film fails to entertain, unless you are some uptight over privileged classist who has never met real people, and enjoy the mockery of the lower class. There is a reason this bombed the box office..."
"i saw this movie because of good rating and expected a good movie. My expectations were torn to pieces after seeing the first 20 minutes itself.i was literally bored to death but went on expecting something at the end due to its rating. but the ending was something far worst than i thought. well it was nothing i only understood it was the end when the credits came up. this movies is worst crap ever. the summary of dis movie would be weakest plot, worst acting ever, use of F word for almost every second maybe more than the actual words, no proper ending. There isn't absolutely anything good to write about this movie the lead actor was total bullshit. for review i wanted to give 0/10 but options started from 1. If you want to ever waste your 120 minutes, your energy and totally spoil your mood please watch this movie."
"Sometimes the film is so good you have to say something. Sometimes the film is so bad you have to say something. Unfortunately it is the latter in this case. I finally started to watch The Big Lebowski. Great reviews everywhere. Have to watch it. It is one of Coen brothers movies. It is rated almost five stars in Amazon. It is rated 8.2 on IMDb. It has to be good, right?Not quite. I couldn't finish it - I had to stop watching it.In the beginning you see a resemblance in the style of this movie and a lot of Quentin Tarantino's movies. I don't know if Coen brothers are borrowing from Quentin Tarantino, or if it's the other way around, but there seems to be plenty of resemblance to this film and Tarantino's films in general.The best Coen brothers movie that they made was Fargo, and maybe it was so good because it was based on a true story. But for this, The Big Lebowski, it reeked of stupidity...but without comedy. It seemed to border on fantasy and improbability."
"Mild SpoilersThe classic Hitchcock premise of dropping an ordinary man into extraordinary circumstances and watching him go is used to terrific effect by the Coens, who are matched all the way by their players.The Dude, a permanently stoned, nihilistic hippy for the nineties who likes listening to tapes of Creedence, whales singing and bowling pins tumbling is attacked in his apartment by two thugs who mistake him for a millionaire of the same given name - the Big Lebowski of the title.Jeff Bridges as the Dude, excited by intermittent moments of clarity, is sent on a journey through mazy plots and sub-plots populated by outrageous characters from the Los Angeles netherworld. Confronted by kidnap, deception, extortion and German nihilists desperate for cash, he is alternately helped and hindered by his buddy, a Polish Catholic, 'Nam obsessed vet who thinks he's Jewish and who threatens fellow travellers who commit minor bowling transgressions with summary execution. The character is played with relish and perfectly by John Goodman in what may be his finest hour. Their bowling buddy, Steve Buscemi, is underused but sports his best crestfallen facade throughout and demonstrates first-rate comic timing as his character tries to get with the programme.The Big Lebowski is not for all tastes, but, if you get it, is one of the most engaging and side-splitting films around, and one which is eminently quotable: ""Walter, you're my friend and I love you, but sooner or later you're going to have to face the fact that you're a goddam moron.""If you don't get it, watch it again. And, if you do get it, watch it again."
"I love the Coen Brothers work.I watched all their films, and Fargo was in many ways the best.However, their latest effort - The Big Lebowski - I found almost unwatchable. The Coen Brothers' films have always, shall we say, been quirky. This hasn't got in the way of good acting, a great script, an interesting plot, a relevant musical score, or excellent cinematography.However in this film, the quirkiness got in the way of everything else. The plot is awful; the script is dire, with the dreaded 'f' work appearing at least once every five seconds (I'm not anti-swearing, but I do get intensely bored of hearing the same dialogue over and over again), the acting is uninspired - Buscemi is totally wasted, Bridges is irritatingly whining (though Tuturro is great, in a small part), the score is unmemorable and the camerawork is dull, except for the dream sequences, which seem forced, irrelevant and pretentious.I couldn't wait for this movie to end. I also cannot believe that people honestly buy into the hype and liked this movie. This is NOT a good movie."
"This movie is truly awful! It's supposed to be some legendary comedy, but it IS NOT funny! This movie is just really weird and stupid. Literally nothing makes sense in it, i hate every character except Julianne Moore's. The dude is so stupid and annoying, and so is John Goodman! I was struggling to understand what in the world the plot was about, and i never laughed, not once! This movie's ONLY saving grace was Julianne Moore, she actually did a good job, and i liked her character, but everything else....nope! 2/10. Save your time for a much better comedy, and just movie in general, such as Plains trains and automobiles, or a million other better ones!"
"The movie isn't bad, but as one of the best of all time? Hardly, the scenes were bland, jokes were average and not a highlight of the Coen's career. John Goodman had a small role, the movie may of been more impressive if it wasn't seen as such as masterpiece. Worth watching ill admit but should not be raved about like a Pulp Fiction 2. Judge for yourself but your taste of movies would of swooped to a new low if you consider this as a 90's classic. Fargo, O brother where art thou, Paris... they can be remembered but this was just a standard movie to kill some time. Best 250 films of all time? hardly.. Feel free to comment back but don't blame me if you are utterly disappointed"
"The story is so nicely lightweight that the whole case is actually dismissible from the entire movie. All those crazy antics The Dude does, and the stupid practical jokes that his responses make is just hilarious. I really like the marmot gag and the ash spreading gag, they are very entertaining. The character building is also very strong. The Dude, Walter and Donny are nicely three sides of a coin, the lazy no good bum, the overly strict and cranky hot-head, and the cowering coward ready to run from anything that shows the slightest sign of danger. The acting overall is quite nice. Jeff Bridges proves his acting prowess in role here as the lazy bum. John Goodman really inserts the crazy comedies from his lines and character role. Having Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare really adds very nicely, while Julianne Moore and Philip Seymour Hoffman complete the angles needed for the story."
"This is definitely one of the most worthless movies I've ever seen in the theater.  I'm STUNNED that it has been voted in the top 250 movies, which shows you that this must be a movie you either love, or totally loathe, as I did.I'm not going to be like most other negative reviewers and just post ""it sucked"" and not give any reasons for that opinion.I'd gotten a ride to the movie theater so I didn't have any way of getting back, so I sat through a movie I ordinarily would have walked out of.My main problem with this movie is the dialogue.  It is laced with so many swear words, yet this doesn't give the dialogue any additional kick.  I have nothing against swearing in movies as long as it accomplishes something. The fact that nihilists feature prominently in this movie makes sense since the whole movie is pretty meaningless.  No real plot, random and incoherent dialogue, just a loser of a main character (Jeff Bridges), and I really didn't care if he lived or died.Obviously the ""genius"" of the movie eludes me.  Note that I have nothing against the Coen brothers, I thought Fargo was brilliant.This movie was awful though.Ack."
"Yes, there was a plot, but for this picture to exist was only because of the actors names. They were not good in this awful example of a comedy either. Not really a spoiler, but, Jeff Bridges finally figures out what is going on with the other, main Lebowski and confronts him at the end. Also not funny. The whole movie is not that funny for listing this as a comedy. I'm sorry I wasted my time watching and am writing this so others don't waste theirs. I think I may have laughed once, if that. Also, in IMDb movie synopsis it states that there were two people pissing on his rug. There were not. It was just one of the thugs doing the pissing. I really wish people would get their facts straight. Really stupid movie. Not a funny movie, at all."
"I was quite interested in watching it.I thought it would be a 2 hours of laughter marathon.In the end i realized i didn't even laugh a single time. the whole story is hardly bears any meaning and there were some jokes i didn't get at all. One more important point is IMDb has been very poor in case of judging comedies.I just found ""Monty Python and the holy grail"" the same boring as Big Lebowski.So,don't be fooled by rating like me.My rating is 1(aweful)"
when i saw this movie i thought how the hell can this make the IMDb top 250 when it should have been in bottom 250.This film is about a pair of lazy douchebags who are supposed to make you laugh but all they are able to do is make u angry with all their useless talk. Then the hero gets attacked in confusion with a man of same identity and the attackers pee on his rug we are treated to his stupid talk of trying to claim the carpet from the original intended victim and the man throws him out.But unbelievably he employs him as a negotiator when his young wife is kidnapped.Julianne moore in the role of a nymphomaniac looks pathetic.And the hero's friend walter tries to be funny but he falls way short of that and makes you sleep with his boring and brainless talk.And i will not talk about the end but i will say it it's as stupid as the movie itself. So if you want to watch this movie on basis of its high rating you will be hugely disappointed. Avoidable.
"It's such a boring movie. I wasted some valuable time watching it. There is nothing funny in it and I couldn't laugh even for once even though I tried. I really don't understand why this has such a good rating. It's such a usual Hollywood story with stereotypical characters. As soon as the daughter of Mr.Lebowski(the millionaire) appears, you know she is going to have sex with the main character. Such a stupid script and the message they give at the end is just for the sake of creating some sense to what they did with the movie. IMDb says they need ten lines of text in a review. Seriously? I don't think this movie even deserves a review. But, I'd take this opportunity to warn those who haven't watched it already."
"First of all, what the f**k was this? I found 8.2 rating on IMDb and movie totally sucks! I am still wondering what made people liking this movie so much? Plot was totally stupid and very much ordinary without any extraordinary element or one-liners, funny scenes, acting, or even photography. This was way too boring and pointless movie to me and it got 8.2 rating? :) Are you kidding me? I think even 3 stars are higher for this boring, jarring, pointless, stupid, silly, worthless, waste-of-time, mind-sucking movie. From the first scene to last scene, I have watched it and thought now there would be something now there would be something but no, at the end, credits started rolling and I simply threw the movie out of my collection. I think I should stop believing IMDb rating as there are movies with 4, 5 or 6 ratings and they are wonderful whereas this got 8.2 stars and movie? Cut it off."
"The Big Lebowski, whether you laugh during the film or not, is assuredly one of the most laid-back of the nineties. I don't mean that by saying that its main fan-base are slackers or hippies or other, but that the whole tone of the film has that air to it. The plot the Coens construct, which is as wonderfully convoluted as a 40's mystery tale (the kinds of stories they get inspired by- The Big Sleep was most likely their title goof), almost gets in the way of the main character and his friends' lives. ""The Dude"" Jeff Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) has a good, if devoid of ""meaning"", life- he bowls constantly with his crazed, Vietnam-vet friend Walter (John Goodman, also very note-worthy) and quiet friend Donny (Steve Buscemi, a fine performance based mostly on reactions), with the occasional setback or weirdo to confront him (i.e. John Turturro's Jesus, a highlight in the film's most absurd moments). Enter in a group of deranged ex-musicians turned nihilists (which include the likes of Peter Stormare and Flea), a pornographer, and a rich man with the same name as Lebowski and his family, and the Dude's cycle is turned upside down, though not knocking into his chemical intake.On top of The Big Lebowski, at the core, one of the most odd, off-the-wall, and creative of the Coens' scripts, with a interesting story and dialog as real as it is sometimes insane, the casting is near perfect, if not so already. It's been said by the Coens that they write some of the parts specifically for the actors, and it shows because it's pulled off. Aside from some usual Coen regulars that don't disappoint, Bridges, for lack of a better term, displays his versatility in taking on this role. Often his roles are of the normal-Joe or the businessman, but what the Coens see is that with the right character he can be funny, and make the people around him just as funny. Not to say there aren't serious parts in the film, where he's put into a rut of conflict by way of the plot. But by the time the audience starts to shift its mindset, another strange, surreal, and/or hallucinogenic bit is kicked in. Throw in some unique production design, and Roger Deakins' expert eye on the scenes (will there ever be another film that captures bowling the way this film does, or at least in such scope and lack of subtlety?), and The Big Lebowski ends up as a cult classic. Not the kind of film that could really play for long in a multiplex (it made back its budget during its run, but not by much), yet one that will continue to have at least a little relevance in not just the indie crowd and Coen fans, but with the kinds of movie viewers who like to have a film on during a party or get-together. In fact, I'd say this beats films like Dazed and Confused and Mallrats as being something that can appeal to a younger (and older, depends) viewing crowd with its ridiculous set-pieces and still be a considerable artistic achievement. Look at it this way, think of the silliest, though smartest Cheech and Chong or Three Stooges film you've seen, and when filtered through a mindset that's loaded with European and film-noir influences, and you'll get The Big Lebowski. Not to mention it's one of the most quotable comedies of the 90's, and has a toe-tapping soundtrack. A+"
"Spoilers herein.The Coens shine into one of the bright zones in my film universe. They are intelligent and fun.I believe that they first select some intellectual issue related to problems of narrative, here identity. Then they, independently, select a film style to exploit, here screwball through Busby (instead of the screwball through Capra of `Hudsucker'). Then they run wild with all sorts of cinematic devices, always cinematic narrative.Of the Coen films I know, this is the most fantastic in terms of shifting realities. Hudsucker shifted often, but only into the `newspaper' mode of `It Happened One Night.' Here we have an arbitrary number of realities and levels, all unstructured which is the point. It is also a favorite because it has Julianne doing what she (and very few others) does best: playing a character who is acting. She gives us herself as the actress, the character as the actress (here an abstract painter) and the quite different character the character plays (the femnist family anchor). She's a gift that the Coens know how to use.The narrative ground zero is supplied by the countertop Cowboy as chorus. The `play within' is the Berkeley dream sequence.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching."
"I have been a fan of a number of efforts from the Coen Brothers. Truthfully, even when they miss the mark, I am still able to find something worthwhile in the effort. The Big Lebowski is the exception to that rule. I originally saw it in theaters, where it played for an eyeblink and received mixed reviews. It was one of the few films my family has ever walked out on. I caught it later on cable and watched it to the end to see if I missed anything worthwhile, since it had inexplicably developed a cult following. The answer was a resounding no.In what can complimentary be deemed a plot, the action centers on a zoned out bowler nicknamed The Dude, who somehow is mistaken for the title billionaire and gets pulled into what must be the most ill-conceived kidnapping plot in the history of cinema.The ludicrous nature of the action would seem to recommend it to comedy, but the film is devoid of laughs. Unless the idea of a young woman's body parts being sent via mail is especially funny to you. The film introduces one needless and ostentatiously bizarre character after another in order to drum up some semblance of entertainment, but since none of them are important to the ""plot"" and have nothing of comical worth to contribute, it all seems a huge waste.The dialogue is basically thinking up new ways to drop the f-bomb every 10 seconds. What passes for comedy is having the avuncular narrator (Sam Elliott) actually stop the proceedings at the midway point to good-naturedly ask The Dude why he has to to use such chronic foul language, to which The Dude responds with another f-bomb. How meta! How coy! And to rouse viewers lulled into a stupor, there are occasionally pointless unrelated fantasy sequences.Julianne Moore shows up to no avail, speaking in some wacko old-Hollywood actress rhythm (think Jennifer Jason Leigh in The Hudsucker Proxy). But whereas Leigh's impersonation had a legitimate reason to be, Moore's quite simply does not. Jeff Bridges can be an amazing actor and has contributed some wonderful cinematic contributions. This is not one of them. It seems incomprehensible that a following has cropped up around this character, because The Dude is little more than a cipher. The Dude is a completely passive non-entity, who spends the duration in a zoned out state. He seems to have nary an opinion on anything and it is inconceivable that anyone could mistake him for the title character, much less a sentient being at all. The plot careens him from one improbable and unfunny set-up to another eliciting little in the way of energy or emotion from him. He is just not remotely interesting here.The only appealing or likable characters in the film are Elliott's narrator and Steve Buscemi, as a perpetually sunny and helpful fellow bowler. Alas, Buscemi is basically here to be bullied, brutalized, cursed at, and finally die. If most of the cast is awash in unlikable and appalling characters, the worst by far is John Goodman. The normally reliable Goodman is so over-the-top that his every moment on screen is like fingernails down a chalkboard. He plays The Dude's ""best friend"", a completely incompetent bully who inserts himself into everything to the detriment of all involved. He drops the f-bomb as much as The Dude and treats everyone around him with loud-mouthed contempt. He is an illiterate, detestable, brutish bore and the performance desecrates the screen, yet the filmmakers actually seem to think his antics are a riot. The film is pretty awful without Goodman's godawful work, but with his participation it descends even further into cinematic hell.I cannot think of anything to say complimentary about the film and the fact that this abomination was vomited forth by otherwise talented filmmakers seems inexcusable."
"This has to be one of the most overrated movies I've ever watched. I mean, I don't hate the Coens, and while I think that Fargo is also very overrated, I love NCFOM and consider it one of the best movies of this century. But as far as The big lebowski is concerned, this movie is not only not funny, as it is incredibly boring and clumsy. I mean, I don't really mind unlikable characters, but when I start wishing them to just die so the movie can end faster, then I know something is very wrong. Or maybe that's what the directors were going for and if that's the case, I can just say congrats, because the totally hit the right mark... I do realize people have different tastes, so I won't tell anyone not to watch it. Maybe it's better in a second viewing or while high or drunk... I will never know it, however, because I'll never watch it again..."
"This story circulates around a bum like perpetual hippie apparently living on some kind of assets as the story makes a point of him being out of work. He's a lazy, viscously phlegmatic and self centered persona.Some ""hired help"" enters his home and almost flushes his head down the WC. The reason for this is not clear but obviously they mistook him for a different guy with the same name, The 'Big' Lebowski, who's enormously well off and sits in a wheel-chair. Some kind of revenge or threat. Anyhow, they pee on the hippie namesake's oriental rug. And thus the story starts rolling.Now, if you know anything about rugs you'd know that you can actually wash off pee. It's done regularly in Iran where almost every home is furnished up the walls in hand manufactured rugs and carpets, and where young kids might pee, or worse, on them.This picture, on the other hand, is not washable. After seeing it a dozen of times, I still don't get what it's all about.The story is too blurry and unintelligible to summarize.It's entertaining, though, and the soundtrack is great.I get the feeling that the Coen Bros really wanted to impress Tarantino, as TBL could well have been a comic book story, just like Pulp Fiction."
"I am in shock that the Coen brothers, who are responsible for Fargo, one of my ten best, could have written such a sophomoric waste of talent, most especially Jeff Bridges who is given the wonderful words, hey man and hey dude, over and over. It is as if Beavis and Butt head have turned from cartoon figures to real flesh and blood. Bridges is the dude, who has been mistaken for a rich guy with the same name. The wealthy mans wife is kidnapped and the dude is drafted to be the go between for the ransom payoff for her safe return. The dude smokes loads of pot, drinks heavily and enjoys bowling on a regular basis. His best friend is Walter, played by John Goodman as a Gulf War veteran with a violent temper. Steve Buscemi completes the triad and all three have never had so little to work with. What a huge disappointment from the usually reliable brothers."
"The story of the Dude (Jeff Bridges) is a strange one indeed. Content to spend his days drinking white Russians and bowling with his buddies Walter (John Goodman) and Donny (Steve Buscemi), the Dude is the alpha bum and ultimate passivist. A case of mistaken identity is what forces the Dude to react (first to get reparations for his soiled rug and secondly to assist in the recovery of Bunny Lebowski) and a torrid tale of plot twists ensues. The Coen brothers are master story tellers that love to tell dark tales that focus on the internal truths of human nature. They do not give us heroes, but instead present us with realistic characters that possess questionable morals as seen in some of their other films like No Country for Old Men, Fargo and more recently The Ballad of Buster Scruggs. The Big Lebowski is no exception as every character introduced possesses some form of character flaw. Ultimately what the Coen brothers are trying to show us (Theme) is that nobody is perfect and that even a bum like the Dude can own the moral high ground over those of higher stature.The Dudes first interaction with one of these characters of higher stature occurs when he is mistaken for the other Jeffery Lebowski (David Huddleston) as one of the thugs urinates on his rug. The Dude visits Jeffery ""Big Lebowski"" Lebowski at his mansion to ask him to rectify the situation by paying for the soiled rug. Even though Mr. Lebowski is clearly at fault and morally obligated to make restitutions, he proceeds to deny any responsibility for the wrongful actions taken against the Dude. This theme continues when the Dude meets Jackie Treehorn (Ben Gazzara), who is the one responsible for the earlier assault. At first Jackie comes off as a reasonable man, offering to pay the Dude a finder's fee for recovering the money he is owed. We quickly find that this was just a set-up, as the Dude slowly drifts off to sleep from the drugs Jackie has mixed into his drink. On a lesser note, though Maude Lebowski's (Julianne Moore) character comes across as cold she appears to me morally sound, however she tricks the Dude into impregnating her as she does not want a father that is going to ""stay in the picture"". All of these characters are elevated members of society yet lack the same morality as the lowly Dude.Throughout the film, the Dudes character is challenged mostly by his friend Walter, who continues to try and manipulate the Dude's decisions. While making the drop off of the ransom money, Walter manages to botch the entire operation by throwing a ""dummy"" bag, and jumping out of the moving car (while driving) which subsequently wrecks into a tree while the dude is inside. However, the Dude maintains his laissez-faire attitude (except with Walter) and remains static all through the film. The reoccurring theme or motif of bowling and white Russians further solidifies the Dudes character as a devil may care ""hippie"" that is very much lost in time. His mind is never truly in the moment at hand, subconsciously thinking about bowling as evident in the two beautifully constructed dream sequences. The soundtrack for the film is the who's who of 60s era music, including the Dudes favorite Creedence Clearwater Revival. Deemed by many as a cult masterpiece, The Big Lebowski shows that even the humblest vagrant can be righteous if their moral compass is true."
This movie came out when I was 5 and yet I was still able to find it years later and relate to the dude! Hilariously loose and laid back performance by the lead. Excellent supporting cast and an all around cult classic for sure!
"I like the way coen brothers write and direct this movie. He always made ""above average films"" in his history. In this movie, he try different thing, it's to make a comedy genre films. But i think he specialize at character depth. Every movie he made such as ""no country for old men"" and ""true grit"" have very strong lead character depth in the films. And he also success in ""the big lebowsky"", the characters depth portrayal (Dude,Walter,Donny,nearly all of the actor and actress) were very exceptional and convincing.Some people said the best thing from this movie was it's humor, they said it's clever. But not for me, this movie has more artistry inside. the strenght of this movie definitely not from it's humor, but from the other things such as character performances, photography, rich script, art-decoration, and music although they're not reach a word ""superb"". We can't compare the humor from ""the big lebowsky"" with ""monty python and the holy grail"" (most intellect comedy), TBL was nothing. But when you see the performances, it is unbelievable. Dude portrayal was astounding even dude was a hard role to play but he did it, and the supporting all took part also. the music really match with the genre of the movie. The script was soft and light but it's clever, not too much badwords like comedy genre movie nowadays.For me, this movie has good entertaining aspect. Because it's light, easy plot to follow, soft and rich script, with great music, and extraordinary acting. If you want got entertained from your stress in the weekend, watch this with your warm people, friends, family, or couple, and i assure you all will got a great experience."
"I caught this film a few years after it came out, with no real expectation, and thought it was OK. However, I had a nagging feeling that there was more to it than I first realised. So I watched it again, and laughed or smiled the whole way through! The Characters play off each other so well; Walter who is actually never really wrong, Donnie who never quite manages to get involved, and the Dude, well, he just wants his rug back.As I am writing this I feel a sense of pride that I re-watched this film as quick as I did. I have since found other ""Lebowski"" enthusiasts who agree that it was on the 2nd watch that the film really comes together.I could quote the film silly, but that would spoil it, so just watch the film. If you like the Coen's or just quirky humorous films, then this is for you..."
"Well , It's my first review here , I really couldn't resist .. I just watched the movie because it has a high rating and Julianne Moore . I really was shocked of the film , gave it 2/10 only because of the last scene that I felt some comedy about it . Rest of the movie I saw no comedy at all . The story isn't that powerful and didn't sound interesting enough to me or maybe it could have been done better. I don't know why it has that high rating or what the people liked most about it but everyone has its taste for sure .. The most boring film that I've ever seen till now .. It's my first time to leave a movie and go to sleep then continue it later .. As for it's genre ,, It's not mysterious as it looks like , not enough crime and Surely not Comedy ..I was expecting much more and I am really disappointed about it"
"Agreed, the enormously popular Coen Brothers are an acquired taste.  And the David Lynches of quirky slapstick must be considered a hit-and-miss affair, but diehard fans are almost always left hungry for more.In the indigestible ""The Big Lebowski"", however, somebody REALLY forgot to tell the boys that off-the-wall just for the sake of off-the-wall can REALLY be bad.  Like the equally indulgent and incomprehensible ""Mulholland Drive,"" this so-called entertainment misses at every step -- as spoof, satire, revenge comedy, whatever.Check out ""Raising Arizona"" and ""Fargo"" to see real genius at work. Unfortunately, the Bros took a total sabbatical from creative filmmaking when they locked horns on this one.  I guess the success of ""Fargo"" went SO to their heads that they decided to test their core fans.  Are we now SO cool and SO popular that we can pass anything off as long as its weird? 
Obviously, from the looks of things, they can.  Oh, please, IMDB people -- this ""film"" is BOTTOM ""250"", not TOP ""250"" material.  It reminds me of the time back in the 1970s when Paul McCartney wagered that he too could throw out anything musically and have the gullible public eating it up.  And so he did.  He composed a new pop tune using the lyrics of ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"", of all things, and earned his next solid hit.  Ugh!  I fear for the future of mankind when stuff like this happens. A thuddingly dull, incoherent mess that purports to be a quirky comedy, Jeff Bridges and John Goodman, who play bowling teammates, are the primary victims of this highway robbery.  Sad too, because this could have been Goodman's night to shine (as he did in ""Raising Arizona"") and, God bless 'em, he does give it both barrels, but what can you do when you're given blanks? Always the professional, Goodman tries to act cool...like he's in on the insanity.  A sleazy Bridges too rolls with the punches as a pothead slacker named Dude who through a series of mistaken identities finds a way of making make some quick dough involving a porno king and mobsters.How can such a dazzling, eclectic cast, who are perfect for this peculiar type of movie fodder, be so abominably misused?  Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, Peter (""Fargo"") Stormare, Ben Gazzara, and David Huddleston in the title role are such pros and come off looking like rank amateurs.  The last vignette with narrator Sam Elliott on a barstool is the capper. Terrible...just terrible.There are two reasons only why I gave this ""BOMB"" a ""2"" out of ""10"" instead of ""1"".  John Turturro as a creepy bowler named Jesus literally comes out of nowhere and demonstrates the Coen Brothers at full potential. His freakishly hilarious scene (which, of course, makes no sense whatsover) shows exactly what can happen when the Bros assert themselves.The other reason is sentimental.  Much of the action takes place at the Hollywood Lanes on Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood, California, where I use to bowl every Monday night.  I loved that place as it holds many fond memories.  Out of nowhere the district decided to tear the place down in the summer of 2002 to make room for a school.  Opposers, like myself, felt it was a landmark and deserved to be protected.  Anyway, it's gone now.
The good news:  Any time I get nostalgic for the old bowling center, I can always rent out ""The Big Lebowski.""  The bad news:  I have to rent out ""The Big Lebowski."""
"I can understand that our average bong-smoking, jobless, couch (or rug) potato American doesn't see himself represented too often in the movies, at least not in a favorable light, so The Big Lebowski must be appealing to a sizable portion of our population. But, for the rest of us, this movie is painful to watch. Have you ever tried to listen to a gang of complete idiots chitchatting for ten minutes? Then go figure what it is to watch it for a full length movie. The worst thing is, the fact this movie was done by the Coen bros. and has a well known cast gives it an aura of respectability it does not deserve. Forget for a second the names in the credits and you're watching standard Cheech & chong material. And that's not a good thing."
"I would like to get the last two hours of my life back. It's the first time that I write a review about a movie but I can't let go this one without trying to low down the score that it has on IMDb. Honestly, it's unbelievable that somebody may enjoy this crappy movie even a little. Maybe is for all the dudes that pretend to be cool enough to understand this kind of ""humor"". Maybe the only good thing about the movie is that it has good performances but I can't believe that such good actors agreed to participate. Hope tomorrow I will not even remember a couple of annoying characters that gave me a nice headache. Don't waste your time."
"Trust me, I am a very open minded film viewer and have enjoyed a vast variety of movies. This film however was a complete waste of time.I got what was trying to be achieved with the movie but it just didn't get any where near where it was supposed to.Sorry folks, a terrible movie that had good intentions but bad guidance!It seems this was a movie that Tarantino would have got a few ideas from but then made a so much more enjoyable film. I was just sitting watching it getting more bored and tired by the minute.This film has a serious 'false' rating."
"This movie is sort of like a circus minus the clowns and the freak show; everything about it is attractive and entertaining. The characters are deep and interesting, and even the most minor of characters have their own unique personality. The camera work is ingenious, as are the visuals and costumes. The comedy comes in from all sides, whether subtle, witty, or straightforward. The Coen Brothers use stereotypes and wording like Van Gough used a brush. It is one of those few movies where almost every line is quotable and easily recognizable. Unlike most comedies (if you could call it such) the story is both followable and enjoyable. One of the true masterpieces of our time. If you don't like this movie, I'm sure you hate to laugh."
"I like the Coen Bros usually,....Fargo doesn't seem as great so many years later but films like Miller's Crossing the recent and very excellent No Country For Old Men are masterpieces,....but this should be changed to The Big Nothing. God, this movie sucks so bad. It was tedious to get thru it. Why do people love this movie so much? I thought it sucked worse than House Of The Dead. Talk about bad stilted dialog, poorly staged scenes, and uninspired scripting....hard to believe it's the Coens at all since their stuff is usually really great. This movie has attained almost cult status and for what? Pure crap. I'd rather watch a Troma film made for 50 bucks."
"I wanted to spend my night laughing and so i skimmed through about 100 movies on IMDb, i came along some really funny movies, but i wanted to see a really good one so i kept looking until i came across this one. Excellent reviews, excellent rating !!!!! What more could i want. I rent the movie from the store, get cozy with my girl friend, and wait for the fun t begin.The movie starts with a guy being a target of a mistaken identity.....some bad things happen....to a certain extinct, little funny....and the plot continues and it goes on and on and on....and nothing at all is funny...by the mid of the movie, me and my girl friend are both bored and pi**ed off...... We couldn't take it anymore. I dint watch the rest of it.Moral: DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. I dunno what kind of people gave a high rating to this crap."
"Jeffrey ""The Dude"" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is an unemployed slacker whose only interest is bowling with his moronic friends (John Goodman and Steve Buscemi). He becomes involved in a kidnapping case when he is mistaken for a millionaire also named Lebowski. Mayhem ensues.I had heard for years that this was a Great Movie, a piece of Film Art from the Coen Brothers. So much for my curiosity. If you like your movies PG like I do, this is a movie to avoid at all costs. The main character is a disgusting slob with no redeeming qualities and the ""F"" word is used 260 times in 117 minutes. The movie is vulgar and pointless. I give it one star only because I can't give it zero stars."
"A highly original neo-noir comedy, one the greatest feats by the brothers Coen. Great roles by all involved (even the tiniest, like the ones by Jack Kehler or David Thewlis), but of course Jeff Bridges and John Goodman steal the show. The story is simply a load of fun, but with great attention to detail, and with a perfect sense of humour. The soundtrack has no striking Carter Burwell theme this time (he only did that technopop thingy near the end), but it consists of various songs and themes, aptly chosen to befit the required mood; from classical to country or pop music and so on - I just discovered there's even a little bit played by the (Dutch) Koninklijk Concertgebouworkest.Apparently, there are some folks even who dón't like this film, or just don't get it, but I certainly don't feel like the Good Lord gypped me, because sometime there's a film... sometimes there's a film - kinda lost my train of thought here... but, aw, hell...11 out of 10."
"Can someone explain what was funny about this movie?  I know I am in the minority, but I just don't get it.  I found it predictable and annoying. I just wonder what I missed.  Anyone have a clear explanation ?"
"The Big Lebowski is the 7th film written, produced and directed by the Coen Brothers. The script was written in the early '90s around the time they released Barton Fink. In the meantime, they wrote, produced and directed the box office bomb, The Hudsucker Proxy, as well as the critically acclaimed and Oscar award-winning, Fargo. They waited as long as they needed to get Jeff Bridges and John Goodman in the cast and it paid off big time.Similar to The Big Sleep, The Big Lebowski takes a convoluted plot to extreme measures. Both films include a wealthy, handicapped millionaire, promiscuous young women, blackmailers and pornographers. Both films make us connect characters to one another and piece together a scattered plot.Taking a large step back from everything that happens in The Big Lebowski, the story is essentially about nothing. There is no money in the briefcase. There is no hostage. The nihilists believe in nothing except money. The Dude is not seen bowling. The Dude has no job and we don't know how he makes an income. Walter uses Shomer Shabbos as an excuse to do nothing on Saturday even though he's no longer Jewish. The only reason The Dude gets involved with Lebowski is due to his rug and agrees to work with him for just a small portion of the ransom. From the beginning, The Dude, Walter and Maude assume that Bunny kidnapped herself to extort money from Lebowski.The bowling alley is the safe haven for The Dude and his team. Walter takes the bowling league very seriously. He threatens a bowler with a gun for stepping over the line and gets him to mark zero on his scorecard. When bowling rival Jesus Quintana (John Turturro) confronts the team, Walter reminds them he's a sex offender that exposed himself to an eight-year-old. Throughout the story, The Dude shares his news to Walter and Donny at the bowling alley. The mysterious man most likely overhears their conversations which is why he can narrate The Dude's story. He's seen talking to The Dude at the bowling alley's bar and appears again at the end. He never introduces himself, but Sam Elliot's resonant accent and thick mustache make his character memorable.The script is very funny and explicit. The Dude and Walter's dialogue often clash but it doesn't get in the way of their friendship. The script was written specifically for Jeff Bridges and John Goodman's characters. Jeff Bridges is perfectly cast as The Dude, he's often misunderstood and spacing out in his own world. Unlike previous Coen Brothers films with Steve Buscemi, Donny can barely get a word out before Walter tells him to shut up. Julianne Moore puts on an interesting accent as Maude, that isn't distinct to any one place. Maude's giggly assistant, abstract artwork and sexual nature make her one of the funniest characters in the film. She's the centerpiece of the Gutterballs dream sequence as a sexy Viking surrounded by bowling pin dancers.The soundtrack is great and it's referenced throughout the film. The Dude and Walter are listening to Creedence Clearwater Revival's ""Run Through the Jungle"" when delivering the briefcase. The cops who look for the car are worried the tape deck with Creedence would be stolen and are relieved when they find it still there. The song used in the opening credits, ""The Man in Me"" by Bob Dylan is used again when Maude knocks out The Dude and takes back the rug. They play the Rolling Stones song ""Dead Flowers"" by Townes Van Zandt after Donny's death.The directing by Coen Brothers is very well done. Many of the cast members are reoccurring from previous films they've directed. The film's structure was influenced by detective fiction writer Raymond Chandler. The cinematography by Roger Deakins made the scenes look contemporary with the time period and the dream sequences to look bizarre. Deakins worked on previous Coen Brothers films such as Barton Fink and Fargo, as well as The Shawshank Redemption. The editing is impressive, especially during the dream sequences. The first-person camera shot inside the bowling ball as it rolls down the lane for a strike looks very sharp. They use pan and zoom shots frequently to go from a wide view of the setting to the subjects. They use long takes, the most impressive coming in the final scene, that finishes with a strike.At the time, The Big Lebowski was one of the Coen Brothers highest budgeted films at $15 million. It grossed just over $46 million worldwide. The Big Lebowski can be enjoyed on many viewings and it succeeds as both a comedy and a crime film. I highly recommend this film to adults.4/4"
"Great comedy, great story, great characters and great acting. I really love this movie, and I have seen it over ten times. I'll be watching it again soon, and I advise, if you didn't like it, to try and put yourselves in the shoes of Jeffrey Lebowski and imitate him, for the duration of the movie. Thanks"
"Is it supposed i have to laugh with the most ridiculous and stupid characters i've ever seen? I hope not. I'd say it's the most stupid movie i've ever seen. There is no hidden humor, or smart comedy. Everything goes around the big dude. Or I'd say, the big asshole! The movie itself is a comedy, it is a parody of a comedy. I have no clue why people loved this movie so much. I start seeing the movie because of that and I've to say it was a complete disappoint. How someone can laugh with such a bad movie? No clue, if someone can explain me that I'd really appreciate it. The big fraud, the big piece pf crap, the big plot without any story... all of them would be really nice names for this movie. Make yourself a favor and don't miss your time seeing this movie."
"The 'dude' a.k.a. Jeff Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is unemployed and likes to bowl. He is unfortunately confused with another Jeff Lebowski who just happens to be very rich. When a case of mistaken identity causes the 'dude' to get beaten up and have his rug damaged he goes seeking retribution from his namesake, because 'the rug really tied the room together man'.The dude's bowling buddies (John Goodman, Steve Buscemi) commiserate and offer their advice while they prepare to meet their arch rival Jesus (John Turturro) in the league playoffs.Along the way the dude becomes involved in a kidnapping and runs across a number of strange characters including a fringe artist (Julianne Moore with a great throwback accent) and a group of German nihilist with a marmot.Weird and at times muddled (intentionally I think) story about confused identities and bowling, the actual plot owes a lot to Raymond Chandler detective stories and films based upon them. Thus we a labyrinthine plot and a large cast of eccentric characters.Features good performances across the board with some wonderful character work a trademark of a Coen brother's film. Also some surrealistic dream sequences and some effective camera tricks.No really deep meaning here for me but it's an interesting exercise in film-making. Not among my favorites from them but It still very entertaining."
"Every so often, I need to watch this movie. At first it was because I would be in need of a laugh. Now it's like chicken soup for the soul. 
I will admit, first time I watched it, I thought it was ok, but it needs a second viewing, a deeper viewing. That's when you will realise how much you love it.
It's a film filled with career best (and loveable) performances. Particularly from Jeff Bridges, John Goodman and an insane performance from John Turturro.
Also Sam Elliot's stranger is the standard that all narration should be held to. His final speach in this movie makes me smile and cry at the same time. I can only hope that someone will say something as beautiful at my funeral."
"Recently given a one night cinematic return to mark 20 years since its initial release. ""The Big Lebowski"" remains on the highpoints of the Coen Brothers remarkable career of excellence. Their farcical homage to Raymond Chandler stars Jeff Bridges, as ""The Dude"" whose real name, Jeff Lebowski drags him into a plot to ransom the wife of his namesake, played by David Huddleston. Blackmailers come to the wrong address, rugs are pissed on and threats are made. Eventually the ""Big"" Lebowski chooses ""The Dude"" to be the bag man for the ransom drop off. A decision that all involved soon come to regret. Twenty years has allowed me to watch ""The Big Lebowski"" a few times, and to be fair it's a film that improves with each watch. The plot is nothing special, in fact it's almost non-existant. The character revolve around each other and at the end of it you're no wiser as to who, if anyone, actually kidnapped Bunny (Tara Reid) or what happened to the $1M dollars. . But you come to appreciate that the plot isn't as important as the characters and what characters they are. Jeff Bridges gives a career best performance as ""The Dude"".... Mumbling and ""man-ing"" his way through the film, which belies the wit that he sometimes allows a glimpse of. It is one of the funniest, most quotable movies of all time. Full of the Coen's regular acting troop, some of whom show up for just one or two scenes, make their memorable mark and then are never heard from again. It is a stone cold classic, and we'll still be watching it in another twenty years."
My Rating : 9/10You either hate it or love it. I am in love with 'The Big Lebowski'! I love most of the Coen Brothers' work and this one is right up there with Fargo and No Country For Old Men. It's super funny and can be watched again and again. I think I watch it once a year and always have a great time.One that I highly recommend. Go watch it! And then watch it again and again.AN AWESOME CULT FILM.
"The story's message is very simple as in all Coen Brothers' movies, 
the symbolism is so subtle and exquisite as in all Coen Brothers' movies, and every character with or without an arc or a sub-plot has a thing to do in the movie's plot or at least make you appreciate the movie even more than you do, but despite all that the redundancy of using the allegory by using many characters and sub-plots with the fast pacing could make you feel the movie's story is very sophisticated and convoluted even it's not. Also, I found some characters haven't been merged well with the plot (even they are very meaningful like the rest of the characters as I said). That being said, these issues didn't bother me at all as I was so invested in each character and I really enjoyed every second in the movie.Jeff Bridges maybe give the best performance in his career. It's really a shame he didn't get an Oscar nomination for his vivid and stellar performance in The Big Lebowski. 
John Goodman was great, and he had a wonderful chemistry with Steve Buscemi as well as with Jeff Bridges.
Philip Seymour Hoffman didn't have a lot of time on the screen but he was so hilarious.Roger Deakins did an awesome job as usual and crafted not just a beautiful cinematography but also a very smart and shiny one that has aged (and will age) very well.The soundtrack maybe is one of the best soundtracks ever put to movie. It's a very very underrated one.The Big Lebowski is a delightful ride. It's one of the best Coen Brothers' movies, and hands down it's the most ""Coen Brothers"" Coen Brothers' movie.(8.5/10)"
"The funniest part of this, 'down and outers' comedy is, that I know several guys, that if you took and rolled them into one, they would equal the Dude, Jeffrey LeBowski. that's pretty scary. I don't even think that they have seen the movie, but who cares? Jeff Bridges is so stinking versatile I can't believe it from a reel-live slacker extraordinare to (The Big LeBowski 1998) a reel-President- (The Contender 2000) with out skipping a beat. For all intensive purposes this movie would be a real waste of time, but this was a side splitting whimsical good time!! From Julliane Moore as the egocentric, emotionally-sterile 'Maude' who was a suspicious investigator, to the best friend (Goodman) who's religious nationality 'changes' because of his 'Ex' who dumped him cold. But as long as he can 'bowl' with the Dude, all his other short-comings, just seem to go by the way-side. But through it all, he (Goodman's character) was a loyal buddy to Jeff and a decent friend, even if he could acquire 'fingers' by 3:00...with nail polish. In all fairness though, LeBowski as a 'private' investigator, reminds me of a quote from 'Dirty Harry' where Harry states (after the 'demise' of a man who is a victim of his own stupidity and greed) 'A man should know his own limitations.' and in this case, having Jeffrey investigate is just as swift as letting the 'fox' guard that Ole' hen house. This was a 'slackers delight' and watching someone who is as good a player as 'Bridges' play a tremendously convincing 'Loser' is just a rare treat. In the comedy section, this one is an ever so often player. Just one that you 'havfta see' every now and again. I don't know who he studied, but if I didn't know better I would swear that he got together with my two 'old school' buds. (****)"
"I get why people gravitate towards the Coens' ""Big Lebowski."" It has a certain appeal that you don't find every day in movies. While most say it has a profound wit and originality that makes it special, I say ""The Big Lebowski"" is an overdone and forced film relied heavily on its weak script. ""The Dude"" Lebowski (Jeff Birdges), mistaken for a millionaire Lebowski, seeks restitution for his ruined rug and enlists his bowling buddies to help get it. With help from John Goodman as The Dude's crazy friend, ""The Big Lebowski"" stays away from complete failure. The film never strives to do anything but portray a goofy crime story that we've seen hundreds of times. Not one performance feels witty or unique, and the direction has zero creative input by the Coen brothers. The Coens are masterful filmmakers, there's no question. It's just that this film is their big flop that everyone still liked. This is perhaps the most overrated movie of all time, and I don't say that lightly."
