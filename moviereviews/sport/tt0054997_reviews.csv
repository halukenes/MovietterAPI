Reviews
"""The Hustler"" is steeped in the seedy atmosphere of smoke-filled pool halls in the ugly urban hinterland of America. The Ames Billiard Hall is funereal in feel.  When 'Fast Eddie' Felson walks in with Charlie, his manager, Charlie remarks, ""These tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.""  The film is about the talented men who perform, but equally about the talentless predators who exploit them.  The habitues of the pool hall cling to the shadows.  They wince when a blind is opened and sunlight gets in.  A new hustler enters, and these vultures gather silently on the margins.Eddie is the youngster hungry for glory.  He and Charlie pose as salesmen and Eddie feigns drunkenness, hooking the punters by repeating an almost-impossible shot.  For all the slickness of the con, Eddie is impatient for bigger things.  He wants to challenge Minnesota Fats, the best hustler in the land.Newman gets his name above the title, but this is a film with four exquisite pieces of acting.  Jackie Gleason as Minnesota, Piper Laurie as Sarah and George C Scott, playing Bert Gordon, turn in wonderful performances.Eddie matures as the story progresses.  He starts as a cheap chiseller, hustling ten bucks, but ambition carries him to Louisville and the world of the high rollers.  Sarah's love opens emotional dimensions in him which he previously lacked.  Bert Gordon confronts him with his own spiritual inadequacies, forcing him to understand himself.  Eddie is jejune in the first game against the Fat Man, but by the second meeting he is emotionally strong, and completely his own man.  He has made the spiritual journey from the whining ""everybody wants a piece of me"" to the inner knowledge that Sarah bequeathed him - that only those who give can truly live.Bert Gordon, with his dark glasses and hawkish features, is a creature of the night.  Loving the 'action' of a clash of talents, but lacking any talent of his own, Gordon is the predator on the sidelines.  Hearing of the new hustler's presence, Gordon arrives soundlessly and sits watching intently for hours.  His dark genius sees the weakness in every soul.  In the bar, when he and Eddie talk business, Gordon is foreshortened to look tiny alongside the talented youngster.  For all his money and sharp wits, Gordon will never be more than a parasite living off the ability of others. Finally, Eddie and Fats walk into the sunlight, heroes who have proved themselves.  Gordon remains perched on his gloomy barstool, a prisoner in his own dark kingdom.If Sarah is the vulnerable, physically-disabled woman who relies on drink too heavily, the victim of the men she encounters, she is also the heart of the movie.  She destroys Gordon's certainty and she shows Eddie the meaning of love.  Her tragedy is Eddie's salvation.  She and Eddie find each other in a deserted bus station in the dead hours.  They are both lost souls, Citizens of Hell.  She is the deformed girl with the empty life, and he is the emotional cripple with no resources of education or character to sustain him.  They cling to each other  as if shipwrecked.  When the seduction comes, Sarah hesitates.  She knows this will lead to suffering. ""Why me?"" she asks, then surrenders to her fate.The time when Eddie's hands are in plaster is Sarah's brief season of happiness.  She stops drinking and even makes progress with her writing. Somebody needs her, belongs completely to her.  It cannot last.
""I made you up, Eddie,"" Sarah tells him, and in a sense she did.  She imagined him to be loyal and stable.  On the night when the truth dawns, Sarah goes from feeling pretty in her new dress to being a rain-sodden wreck.  She is supplanted in Eddie's attention by the sinister Gordon, who asserts the new power-balance in the railroad dining-car.  The hotel suites are adjoining, and though Sarah closes all the doors, she can't keep Gordon out.  By Findlay's party, she has hit the bottle again.  The patterned dress which Eddie bought her, a symbol of her incarceration, has the shadow of the ballustrade projected onto it, seemingly magnifying her sense of ensnarement.Though Jackie Gleason does very little in this film, he dominates it. On screen for a fraction of the film's totality, and having neither great speeches nor grand gestures, he impresses by his sheer presence.  Stillness, self-containment and an ironic amusement make Minnesota Fats the perfect foil for the angry, ambitious Eddie.  In the final showdown, Fats' quiet poise outshines the grandstanding of the others.  Gleason conveys beautifully the fear at the core of this big dandy.  When Eddie has him in trouble, the Fat Man begins to lose his sartorial integrity as his confidence unravels.This contrast of stillness and motion is effective in the first meeting of the hustlers.  Fats and Gordon, who know what they are about, remain motionless and tranquil.  Eddie the incontinent wannabe gradually loses control of both mouth and limbs.  The film is rich in symbolic language. The cheap rooms which Eddie rents are mere boxes for hire, like the bus station locker which he lives out of.  When he and Sarah meet for the second time, the inevitability of their coupling is conveyed in a scene without words or gestures.  Eddie's plastercasts are manacles - without his hands, he is nothing.  A sumptuous restaurant and a happy couple are transformed when the brutal truth emerges.  The camera angle is reversed, and Eddie and Sarah are now separated by gaunt shelves of crockery.  The illusion has been shattered.  When Eddie sneaks out on the sleeping Sarah with the stake money in his hand, it is the betrayal of Charlie re-enacted.A marvellous film is enhanced by a superbly sleazy jazz score (Kenyon Hopkins) and the violence is all the more gut-wrenching for being suggested, rather than shown.Verdict - probably a masterpiece."
"It's an intriguing idea. If a person is talented, that person should be a winner. And, we would expect a loser to be someone who is not talented. But the idea that someone could be a talented loser is a paradox, a contradiction that doesn't fit into the conventional mindset of American culture, and is the basis for ""The Hustler"", a character study of an ace pool player who can't seem to win respect from his peers.The pool player is (Fast) Eddie Felson (Paul Newman). The plot moves along by means of four secondary characters with whom Fast Eddie interacts: (1) his manager, Charlie; (2) the veteran pool player, Minnesota Fats; (3) Eddie's girlfriend, Sarah; and (4) the money man, Bert Gordon.""The Hustler"" is very much a product of the late 50's and early 60's, when progressive filmmakers were trying to buck the staid post WWII era, with its reactionary Cold War mentality that resulted in strict conformity to established American values. In this film, Bert Gordon and Minnesota Fats represent the establishment. Eddie Felson is the loner, up against the establishment; he's the renegade kid, out to beat the system. Yet, at every turn, the establishment beats Eddie, one way or another. His idealism is useless. He must conform to the establishment's rules, expressed in the film as ""character"", or give up his dreams.The film is therefore very cynical and incredibly cold. From start to finish, there's not an ounce of humor. It depresses the spirit. But the film is a very good metaphor for a terrible era wherein societal repression was the norm.While the story's main character may be a loser, the film itself is a talented winner. The excellent B&W lighting, together with a jazzy score, create an effectively somber and downbeat tone, consistent with the oppressive political atmosphere of that era. The dialogue is sparse and incisive. And the acting is persuasive. Paul Newman is convincing, as are the secondary characters. I especially liked the performance of Jackie Gleason, who comes across as suave, serious, and in total control, a great contrast to his comedic side, in ""The Honeymooners"".""The Hustler"" is depressing and grim. But the film is very well made. It entertains in ways that are obvious, and educates in ways that are subtle."
"I've seen The Hustler repeated times, thought not as many as some of the other commentators.  Recently I saw it for the first time in the theater, at the Alamo Drafthouse in Austin.  Watching ""The Hustler"" in a theater is like listening to Dave Brubeck's ""Time Out"" album: you start to see and even hear things in black and white.  You know the pool tables are green, and the balls are multi-colored, but somehow the black and white perfectly matches the colorless existence of the protagonist and his supporting players.  You can smell the cigarettes, taste the booze.Newman, Gleason, Scott, and Laurie all turn in great performances.  But this movie, made after the heyday of the studio players' contract, still bears the hallmark of great movies from that era: strong supporting performances all the way down the line.  Vincent Gardenia, for pete's sake, as the unlucky bartender in the first scene!  Michael Constantine as Big John. Myron McCormick as Charlie, Eddie's sponsor most of the way through the movie.  And Murray Hamilton as the millionaire Southern mark.  This movie was made when supporting roles were an end in themselves, by actors who believed every second they were on screen should be of high quality.The day I wrote this review -- January 18, 2004 -- The Hustler was no. 143 on the Top 250 list.  No way are there 142 better movies."
"This is, without a doubt, the closest anything out of Hollywood ever came to touching the soul of a pool player. Paul Newman plays ""Fast Eddie"" Felson, a young player from California who travels east to take on the ultimate challenge: to beat ""Minnesota Fats,"" played by the late Jackie Gleason.Willie Mosconi, probably the greatest pool player who ever walked the Earth, was technical adviser and choreographed many of the game sequences. On technical merit alone, this film is a pool player's classic. Beyond that, however, the way ""Fast Eddie"" takes to his skills and relationships pushes this film out as a classic for the general audience. In one scene, he is describing what it is like to be really good at something. It is one of the best speeches about excellence I have ever heard. This is one of my top three films. On a scale of ten, I give it an eleven."
"Because of his tragically erratic, often interrupted career, Robert Rossen is rarely put into the pantheon of great Hollywood directors. However, he produced three films which deserve  a permanent place  among the classics, All the Kings Men( probably the best film about American politics), Lilith( one of the greatest films about mental illness) and this, a movie which DESERVES to be ranked with the hundred greatest, and possibly the fifty greatest, American films. It is superbly acted, brilliantly photographed and edited, and directed with clarity and assurance. In a just world ( if there is such a place), an special Oscar would have been bestowed on Newman, Laurie, Scott, and Gleason AS A GROUP. Piper Laurie was unforgettably poignant, Scott unforgettably sleazy, and Gleason... well, Gleason simply IS Minnesota Fats. Paul Newman almost certainly deserved the Oscar.It was  an amusing irony, perhaps a little joke by God, that the bartender in the movie was played by none other than Jake LaMotta."
"I think ""The Hustler"" is the best sports movie ever made. Fast Eddie Felson is perhaps the most talented pool shooter in the country and yet, at his core, he's a born loser. Why is Eddie so self-destructive? He has Minnesota Fats, ostensibly the country's greatest player, beaten in the first marathon match only to drink himself into insensibility and let Fats off the hook. Throughout the movie Eddie is surrounded by other people who are self-destructive or only interested in making a buck off of him. Even Charlie, his original manager (Myron McCormick in a terrific role)needs him for a meal ticket. Bert, his second manager, is a slithering, calculating parasite who uses everyone around him. Sara, Eddie's pathetic girlfriend, is going through life in an aimless, alcoholic haze. The movie really lets you into the lives of these people who live on the margins of society. The cinematography is outstanding, the settings and mood of the movie draw you in totally. The acting is uniformly outstanding from top to bottom. Great movies get great performances from the minor characters, too. Vincent Gardenia, Michael Constantine, Murray Hamilton and McCormick are perfect in the smaller roles while Paul Newman, Jackie Gleason, Piper Laurie (all getting well-deserved Oscar nominations) and George C. Scott are indelible in the major roles. Even boxer Jake LaMotta has a cameo as a bartender. Can Eddie finally overcome being a born loser? Can love redeem any of these lost people? What makes a person a champion? Is it talent alone or does a champion need some inner demon that can only be defeated by pursuing victory at all costs?"
"This must be one of the best movies I have ever seen. Just about everything was perfect about it.The acting was top-notch, especially George C. Scott as the Hustler hustling the hustler. His performance gave the movie a gritty underworld feel to it. Piper Laury delivers a powerhouse performance as the ill-fated drunk girlfriend of the lead player Paul Newman. He probably delivers one of his best roles to date. Just like Robert De Niro in Raging Bull he plays a character who is incapable of handling the pressures of fame and fortune, who is as George C. Scott's says ""A born loser"". If you look in Newman's eyes during the picture you can see the troubles he is going through. He loves the girl, but is unable to express this because he is afraid she will know the real him. He has to keep playing this Hustler-character all through his life to keep himself going. He knows nothing other than playing pool and hustling people out of their money.The cinematography was absolutely brilliant alongside the set-dressing. The dirty, low-life feeling that must have hung around these dives called poolhalls was conveyed perfectly to the screen through brilliant lighting and art direction. The scenes in which Newman plays the different people at the pool table were shot and edited to near perfection (which has been redone again to near perfection in The Color of Money by Martin Scorsese).The music gave a real emotional feel to this moving picture. Kenyon Hopkins deserves all the credit for this.Absolutely a must-see for everybody who like to watch movies that are worth watching.10/10"
"The Hustler is a classic 1961 film about the shady pool halls of the post-WWII era. Anyone of the three main characters could fill the titular role, whether it be Paul Newman's up-and-comer, Jackie Gleason's man-to-beat, or George C. Scott's behind-the-scenes angle-shooter.These three stars (all-Oscar nominated) carry the picture, both individually and collectively. The thirty-ish Newman is simply a revelation to anyone (me) who hasn't seen him act much in his prime. He perfectly captures the smooth, in control but on the edge persona of Fast Eddie, who has the physical tools, but not necessarily the mental skills to be a champion. Gleason likewise perfectly fills the body and clothes of Minnesota Fats, with a graceful elegance uncommon to a man of his size. Scott (who declined his Oscar nomination) could easily have been overshadowed in his role, but his subtle and shifty eyes and movements create a character that occasionally outshines his two huge co-stars.The Hustler reaches its zeniths when at least two of these men are on the screen. The dialogue exchanges of Newman and Scott as they feel each other out crackle with intensity. Gleason and Scott ooze wary respect for each other; and Newman and Gleason combine admiration and competitiveness into one neat package from which the entire film derives its energy.A film about pool sharks seems to demand brilliant representation of its colorful world. But French cinematographer Eugene Shuftan instead opts for black-and-white, which surprisingly works wonderfully. His Oscar-winning imagery particularly excels in displaying light and shadows, such as the sun streaming into smoke-filled billiards halls. Shuftan accomplishes an exceptional feat, using a monotone style to effectively paint vivid pictures.Despite high achievement in so many areas, The Hustler suffers from Doughnut Syndrome: there's a hole in the middle. The pool scenes that bracket the story are very good, and one middle scene between Newman and Scott is the best of the film, but the romantic portion of the story flounders. The drifter Newman falls for a fellow drifter (Piper Laurie) for no apparent reason, other than alcohol and the fact that they're both alone. To their credit, they do acknowledge that their relationship is flimsy and depraved, but the movie squanders too much times on this wafer-thin story arc, rather than stick with what works.Those parts succeed wildly, about as enjoyable as any scenes ever shot, but without adequate buttressing material, the film as a whole falls short of the high watermark left by its parts.Bottom Line: Phenomenal at times, but subpar at others, the male performances carry the film. Seven of ten, but definitely worth viewing if you haven't seen it yet."
"Spoilers herein.Here's a game I play: find the similarities between the story and how the story is told. After all, the same mind makes both decisions. Often there isn't deep reflection on the choices -- they just feel right. But sometimes the relationship shows careful selection of strategies and philosophies.  We see here that the key artists know what they were about and engineered the drama to reflect the dynamics of pool.The story is simple: characters as pool balls, bouncing off of one another, with a particular combination shot resulting in both a death of one and the better placement of another. Every element of the story reinforces this notion. The staging is very abstract, very clean. Cinemascope black and white provides a wide table. But watch these actors. I really appreciate actors who have both ability as actors and ability to integrate their methods into the larger methods of the project. Very few actors know how to do this, or even care. They instead substitute what we as viewers call ""ensemble"" acting, which consists of bouncing off of each other like balls. That happens here, but this is Scott's project: he adds a dimension to this, the dimension of manipulating the dynamics of the actors. Meta-acting. His character manipulates everyone else; two of them (Fats and Fast, whose very names indicate permutations like poolballs) try to manipulate each other, and the method is manipulating balls. But then of course, the balls are them, their configuration affects the competition between Fast and Fats, and on up the chain determines how well Scott and his character play their games.Scott is an underappreciated actor, actually I mean to say that he is appreciated for his superb ability to do the ordinary rather than his risky attempts to do (as here) the extraordinary. I can this folded acting. Newman knew he was being manipulated as an actor and himself claims to not have learned folded acting until much later in ""The Verdict.""Piper is exploited as an actress just as her character is. She's clueless.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching."
"Possible minor spoilers.'The Hustler' is a great movie that involves the game of pool. Although this is important it is not really about the game. It is more about the life around it, Fast Eddie Felson's life in particular. Paul Newman plays this man in a terrific way. Eddie is a great pool player, he could be the best, if only he had more character. This is what Bert Gordon (George C. Scott) tells him. It is true. Eddie is a self-destructive man. He drinks too much and he does not know when to stop. At one point early in the movie he is playing the man who is considered the best of the country, Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason), and he has won 18.000 dollars but he gets too drunk and loses everything.(Minor spoilers.) Then he meets a girl Sarah (Laurie Piper) who, like him, drinks too much. They start living together and it seems that Eddie is changing, but we suspects he is always thinking about playing Minnesota Fats again. Eddie gets in some trouble, his thumbs are broken, and after this he decides that he needs Bert Gordon to get back on track again. Gordon made him an offer before his thumbs were broken which seemed pretty unfair but now Eddie thinks he has no choice. He has the woman he loves on one side, who could get him out of trouble, and the game of pool and his desire to be the best on the other. What will happen is for you to see.The interesting story about this self-destructive man is also about the self-destructive woman and the events around her are almost inevitable. The hero is a hero in most ways, but it is a hero who must face his weaknesses instead of discovering his strong points. This kind of hero is rare these days. Paul Newman shows us why he became such a great star with this memorable role.Other things are very good too here. Although the game is never explained it is fun to watch every shot, some of them almost impossible. The black and white cinematography looks great. Fast Eddie Felson would return in Martin Scorsese's 'The Color of Money', a lesser film in some points but very good as well."
"When is a movie about pool not a movie about pool? When it's The Hustler. Watching this for the first time, i was expecting a movie full of games of pool with trick shots galore, with Newman the hero getting the girl and beating Fats the champ, role credits...a nice little feel good story. wow, was i ever mistaken (and very pleasantly surprised to be). The Hustler is filled with great performances: Newman, Gleason, Scott, and Laurie all give great, GREAT performances that makes a fairly simplistic plot with little real action absolutely riveting to watch. Newman is great as Eddie the born loser with talent coming out of his ears, but not enough brains to know how to utilise it best. Gleason is great and says a lot with simple body language more than the few lines he has. Scott is phenomenal as always as a soulless gambler only looking out for himself and dragging all those around him down as well. Laurie is perfectly suited to her character, a desperate, lonely alcoholic who seems to know her relationship with Eddie is bad for both of them, yet is unwilling or unable to break free.The Hustler is amazingly written, with quotable lines and dialogue that just cuts deep into the cores of these characters; as they interact with each other and are forced to show their true colours, we see the true people underneath as the facade is stripped away. These are damaged, broken, confused, troubled souls who seem to gravitate towards one another, as if they can sense a kindred spirit. I have to say that the reason these characters resonated so strongly with me, is because, as unpleasant as it is to do so, i can see elements of myself in each character.This kind of movie is one that would be nigh on impossible to get made in contemporary Hollywood. A downbeat story from start to finish, with unlikeable characters, it is one of the greatest films i have ever seen. an absolute classic in the purest sense."
"Director-scriptwriter Robert Rossen provides a realistic glimpse into the dirty world of the pool hall, and makes it a battleground on which strength and courage are tested Fast Eddie is not the traditional, heroic white knight He's a crafty pool hustler, a man who makes his money by tricking opponents into thinking he's not as good as he really is But he wants more than cheap hustlinghis ambition is to beat the country's top player, Minnesota Fats, and this places him with Newman's other obsessed seekers of grand goals Newman really gets inside the charactermakes us feel his desperate drive In the opening scenes, depicting Eddie's marathon match with Fats (Jackie Gleason), he personifies overwhelming confidence, coolness and conceit; as Eddie puts it, he's ""fast and loose."" He grins, moves with assurance around the table, and baits Fats: ""I dreamed about this game, fat man. I dreamed about it every night on the road. Five ball. You know, this is my table, man. I own it.""But there's an underlying insecurity, and a self-destructive tendency He doesn't know when to stop, and even though he's $18,000 ahead, he won't quit until Fats is demolished His cockiness leads him to become careless and eventually to fall into a drunken stupor Fats, in contrast, remains casual and emotionally serene, and he takes all of Eddie's money As Fats' manager, the crafty, snake-like Gordon (George C. Scott), says, Eddie's ""a loser.""Eddie's arrogance is unpleasant and his lack of restraint is pathetic, but he's partially redeemed by his affair with Sarah (Piper Laurie), a self-pitying, sore, worn-out alcoholic, whose vulnerability attracts him It's a splendidly enacted relationship between two derelicts, beginning as a casual pickup and developing into tentative affection Initially all they do is drink and make love, and, even though Sarah (Piper Laurie) realizes he is not much better than a bum, she (like many women in Newman films) wants more The turning point occurs when Eddie again loses his restraint and shows off to some men he's hustling, whereupon they break his thumbs Now, for the first time, he needs Sarah's help, and their relationship deepens as he realizes his dependence upon herAnd she's the only person he can talk to about what most moves him In a picnic on a hillsideone of the best scenes in Newman's careerEddie explains that he lost his restraint with the small-time players because he had to show them what pool is like ""when it's really great."" He says that at times he becomes so immersed in pool that his arm and the cue perform as one beautifully functioning organism This speech is rendered almost poetic by Newman's passionate expression and delivery; together with earlier scenes in which we saw Eddie's movements in the game and his look of admiration at Fats' grace, it convinces us that whether he wins or loses, Eddie is alive only when playing poolSarah is moved to express her love, but the closest he can come is: ""You need the words?"" She does, but he can't say them And ultimately, whatever love he may feel is overshadowed by the all-consuming need to get back at Fats He cruelly rejects his fatherly manager (Myron McCormick), who has no such haughty ambitions, and becomes a slave to Gordon, who says he'll always be a loser unless he rids himself of Sarah""The Hustler"" is Newman's most balanced characterizationon the one hand, ruthless ambition, arrogant confidence and inability to express love; on the other, vulnerability, recognition of dependence and genuine self-realizationand he brings it all off to perfection It was his most critically acclaimed performance to that time The film received nine Oscar nominations, including Newman's second as Best Actor The award went to the vastly inferior Maximilian Schell (Judgment at Nuremberg), but Newman did win the British Academy Award"
"THE HUSTLER is a sport drama about a bitter life and an unscrupulous competition. Film is based on Walter Tevis novel of the same name.A small-time pool hustler travels cross-country with his partner and earns, on fraud, some money. His attitude and his big mouth forcing him to challenge the legendary player ""Minnesota Fats"". A challenger and legend finally meet each other. Straight pool duel can begin. Their game attracts the attention of a professional gambler. The young challenger has, despite a noticeable talent, lost the match. He leaves his partner and he meets, at the local bus terminal, a girl, who is an alcoholic supported by her father, attends college part-time, and walks with a limp. They start a strange relationship. However, the pool hustler wants again to challenge a famous rival. His talent does not seem sufficient, he needs a strong character...A restless, irritable and evil protagonists are perfectly integrated into a dark atmosphere. Their greed for a fame and money has ruled out any form of love and nobility in this film. The plot is brisk and exciting. Every word or move is full of passion and has its price.Paul Newman as Eddie Felson is a passionate and violent pool hustler. The protagonist, who is, at one point, on the top of his life goal, and then drops down until he touches the bottom. He was intoxicated with his ambition. The loss of a loved person and a bitter life knowledge are his brutal sobering. Mr. Newman has offered a quite good performance. Piper Laurie as Sarah Packard is his girlfriend, who has lost in her unclear past. However, when Eddie comes into her life, she revives her pathetic reality. She is a dominant character in one part of the film, in which she emphasizes their tragic fate. George C. Scott as Bert Gordon is an antagonist on duty. He is an evil which trades with feelings and souls. His performance is very convincing. Jackie Gleason (Minnesota Fats) is a cool as a legendary player. However, he has become a prisoner of his talent and money.Maybe this movie is a strong projection of the real world, which is complemented with a cynical reviews and a tragic-ironic end. The protagonists have condemned themselves to a bitter taste of life."
"Paul Newman stars along George C. Scott, Jackie Gleason and the reclusive Piper Laurie as his neurotic girlfriend, who will ultimately prove her mettle by being nominated for no less than three Oscars for three movies, including the mother of a very special girl in Carrie two decades later. Newman is still in his raw, just-becoming-a-star period of his career, having completed The Long Hot Summer, and then Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, and having finally figured out his tumultuous love life, leaving his wife and kids for Joanne Woodward, with whom he would forge a lasting relationship of fifty years. Newman cements his position as one of Hollywood's finest leading men with Hustler, although the script leaves him a little bit short of material. But Hustler is considered a classic, with nary a mediocre performance in the bunch. The cinematography is a bit short on the pool hustling scenes, with the later remake (albeit in color) better succeeding in dramatizing the action and flow of the pool games.For buffs who are watching this slightly darker movie after the Tom Cruise version, The Color of Money, where Newman trades places with George C. Scott to play Cruise's handler, it bears noting that this black and white classic is a bit slower paced, taking the necessary time to build up the characters and their associated pathologies, although younger viewers may find this off-putting, having been fed altogether too much action in the first five minutes of everything cinematic while just ignoring character depth.Consider that The Hustler is a must see, just like Breakfast at Tiffanys or Raging Bull, in that it marks the beginning of a screen acting legend and suggests his future prowess, while providing a gripping storyline along side some really talented actors, and suggesting its rightful place in cinematic black & white classics."
"Robert Rossen carefully directs this film with every ounce of poise one can muster. There's not a dull moment within the entire picture. It's filled with exciting characters, fine editing and a compelling story that'll shock and thrill you. The cast is incredible, as to be expected with these names: Newman, Scott, Gleason, Piper Laurie and Murray Hamilton are crystalline in their performances."
"Positives: The cinematography deserved all of its Oscar, and George C. Scott and Jackie Gleason are majestic. When they're on screen or the story picks up, it's a gripping movie. There's not a duff turn among the supporting cast either.Negatives: Was Newman trying to be Brando? Because for me, his performance bombs - he looks like a nerdy college kid trying to act tough, the cockiness is totally forced and overplayed. And what are the redeeming features of Piper Laurie's character that Eddie puts up with her? She goes around being a mouse and bringing everybody down, the wrong sort of drunk for the story. These tough guys would have found a good-time gal, or at least told her to cheer up once in a while. If Eddie's trying to help her because he feels the need to help himself it doesn't come over in the script. Her aspirations to becoming a writer consist of four lines typed up one drunken afternoon, and the three (ten-dollar) words on the mirror. That's pantomime. There's no hint that she knows she's deceiving herself, or drinking secretly, or that she has any inner pain at all - she's just grumpy ALL the time. (She had polio and her father died - that's it? Maybe it's the hairdo). Sarah's misery is all taken as read, same as Eddie's genius (he never practices) and the characters come across as half-baked. Sarah's story also steals the focus from Eddie; she does make a far bigger sacrifice after all. But because the character is so thinly written, there's no chemistry between her and anybody. In fact the only dramatic tension is in the pool contests, which may make you feel 'The Hustler' is better than it is. Presumably this movie was part of the early 60's gritty realism trend in drama, but these preppy actors attempting a methody thing with the progressively more overripe script just come across as pretentious. 'The Cincinnatti Kid' is a far better sports drama of the time. 'The Hustler' tries to do too much."
"Character, class, love, greed, are all examined under the glaring light hanging over the pool table in a movie about everything but pool. Classic photography, editing, and performances by Paul Newman (self destructive Fast Eddie), Jackie Gleason (Minnesota Fats, the man to beat with the Cheshire Cat grin of knowledge), Piper Laurie (the wary walking wounded) and George C. Scott (brutal capitalist with the watchful eye and cutting commentary).  They just don't make em like that anymore.  Perfect from start to finish."
"Fast Eddie Felson is one of the all-time great anti-heroes.  He is a drifter who is arrogant and has used many people in his life to get where he is. But when where he is is nowhere, he grows up.  He learns the value of lost opportunity, and he gains integrity at a high price.  It is worth a look for anyone who wants to see the redemption of a lovable curmudgeon."
"The Hustler is one of those rare films that has been so well crafted that it is lauded by both critics and savvy audiences alike as a benchmark film, the quintessential movie about pool, its players and hustlers, and the obsession and drive involved with wanting to be the greatest. What makes a movie great is when all the elements come together so beautifully, from the casting, acting, directing, cinematography, editing, etc., that it works virtually flawlessly both as a whole and as individual elements. The Hustler is one of those films. You could argue how you could have made it differently but you would be extremely hard pressed (or delusional) to claim you could have made it better. As anyone who has seriously acted or otherwise participated in a film or play will tell you, once enough of the right elements have come into play, the film or play will take on a life of its own and all the strengths will make each other stronger and better, the rare phenomenon of a group of individuals working on the highest common denominator, as opposed to the too frequent degenerating into the lowest common denominator. The casting is great with not a single weak performance anywhere from a young Paul Newman when he was at the peak of his craft, down to Jake LaMotta (the real ""Raging Bull"") who plays a bit part as a bartender. The acting is so often brilliantly understated you might think you are watching a documentary, especially since the film is shot in stark black and white. The unflinchingly honest realism is one of the underlying elements that gives this film such great life. None of the characters or situations are glamorized, including the love between Eddie (Newman) and Sarah (Piper Laurie). They are two lost souls who are drawn together by their shared angst and alcoholism yet develop a true, powerful love that is heartfelt and realistic. They don't magically make each other perfect but they do bring each other some happiness and relief from their loneliness. Jackie Gleason is perfectly cast as Minnesota Fats, partly because he was ""The Great One"", Jackie Gleason, but also because he really knew the game of pool. Probably Holloywood's greatest all time pool player, in real life he hustled full grown men when he was an eight year old kid. Incidentally, both Newman and Gleason did their own pool shooting in the movie, adding to the movie's realism. George C. Scott plays Bert Gordon, the powerful, dangerous hoodlum who controls the money and action for both Eddie and Fats. Scott gives such a fine performance you could easily imagine he would have been a real life Bert Gordon if he hadn't been an actor. If you want light, shallow fare, then ""The Hustler"" is not for you. But, if you are looking for a great, honest movie that will haunt you as you remember many of the moments in dark poolrooms, where everyone smoked and drank too much back when they were socially encouraged and viewed as relatively harmless; a film that neither preaches nor glamorizes, it just shows what is, powerfully and unapologetically, so you are forced to draw your own conclusions as you see that everything has its price and that even for the supposed winners, there are no magical, happily ever after scenarios where everyone and everything is beautiful and perfect, but rather flawed and struggling to find an elusive state they will probably never achieve, then you will truly enjoy ""The Hustler"", a great film."
"""The Hustler"" and ""The Color of Money"" are movies for two different generations and ought not to be considered as a movie and its sequel. The only person who can carry from one movie to the other is Paul Newman, and his ""Hustler"" performance, for which he received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, is far above the performance in ""Color"" for which he got an Oscar for Best Actor! There simply is no comparison. Rent (or buy) both and see for yourself. No question the first movie had the better acting in it: George C. Scott, Jackie Gleason, Piper Laurie, Murray Hamilton, Myron McCormack, etc. We want to see Eddie redeemed in ""Color""  hinting that it might not have yet come for him in spite of what he experienced through the loss of Sarah (Piper Laurie) and the betrayal by Bert (George C. Scott). He seems to have survived in ""Color"" but it is unfortunate he did not allude to anyone who was in the first movie, particularly Sarah. I first saw ""The Hustler"" when it came out in 1961, and now that I own the DVD, I plan to enjoy it many times. It depicted a very small world, but it was a world made up of people like you and I. The ending was classic. In spite of Eddie's defeat of Fats, life seems to go on. Fats goes home, Bert goes back to his chair, the spectators of the game shuffle off into the nothingness from which they came, and Eddie moves out into his new life, but with hope. It is a good movie if you want to come out with a good feeling about the spirit of life itself."
"Perhaps unsurprisingly given its title, The Hustler is a film about deception. Fast Eddie (Paul Newman) is a handsome, honest looking guy who hangs out in seedy pool halls, bars, and motels so he can hustle people at pool. He pretends to be drunk or impaired so the denizens of these places will look at him and see easy money. Once they are hooked, Eddie employs his great skill and beats them easily. Eddie is so good at this that in some cases the mark doesn't even realize he's been hustled.Merely beating common people out of their money is not enough for Fast Eddie, however. After what seems to have been years of hustling people, he decides to go after Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason) the man who is supposed to be the best pool player in the country.After his match with Fats, Fast Eddie ceases to travel. Before long he meets Sarah Parker (Piper Laurie) a depressed alcoholic and moves in with her. Eventually he prepares to return to the world of pool, upsetting his fragile lover. The conflict between the two sides of Eddie's personality (emotionless hustler and passionate lover) leads to the climax of the film.Every character in The Hustler is a hustler of some sort. Fast Eddie makes a living hustling and his relationship with Sarah begins as a hustle. Sarah's own hustle involves her invention of a character that she pretends to be all the time instead of being herself. Everything she tells Fast Eddie in early scenes is later revealed as a lie, ironically including the part about her past career as an actress. Eddie's manager Bert Gordon (George C. Scott) hustles Eddie by mocking him at certain times to keep him in control. Even Minnesota Fats hustles Eddie in subtle ways by acting as if he is in control during their contests.Essentially The Hustler is a character driven film about Fast Eddie's struggle to find meaning in his own life. He has to choose between success in pool or his relationship with Sarah. This conundrum (and his desire to prove himself) torments Eddie, but the decision is ultimately taken away from him and Eddie learns the bitter lesson that an individual doesn't always have time to make his own decisions.For those looking for a grimy, cynical character study seasoned with a pinch of melodrama, The Hustler is a great choice. Those looking for a glossy feel good film should look elsewhere."
"Because this is Paul Newman's signature role, a lot of people overlook Gleason's performance. Like Brando in ""The Godfather"" or Hopkins in ""Silence of the Lambs,"" his screen time is very short but hangs over the entire film. After the first shoot-out, as the story progresses, you know in the back of your mind that he's back at Aames waiting. Newman's performance is one of the greatest, but he's young, still coming into his own and has a few awkward, heavy-handed moments--for example the ""I'm the best you've ever seen"" speech is done awkwardly in a Brooklynesque accent that's just weird. Having BEEN a hustler, Gleason's performance is massively confident, flawless. Iconic performances: Ralph Kramden, Minnesota Fats and Sheriff Beauford T. Justice (Bandit I, only)--this guy was a GREAT actor with the right material. At one point, in the late 50s I think, he was considering playing an old-time ward pol in a John O'Hara script. That would have been something to see and may have put him over the top as a dramatic actor. Recommended: the movie version of ""Requiem for a Heavyweight"" with Gleason as Maish Rennick, another top Gleason/late-noir turn."
"There isn't one weak scene in this movie. Not a one.  To me this truly is the  cinematic ultimate of what a movie is all about. In no other movie has there been such a universal theme so well portrayed. The theme here is what makes a winner, what defines a loser.  The answer is character. How do we obtain that elusive ring? Through the crucible of disaster? Of a love lost? By selling out?The pool game in this movie is merely a convenient prop. This movie is NOT about pool.  We have seen this shoot out before.  The fast young guy challenges the king. King of the Hill is a nice term for boys growing up. Some gain the maturity to move on, to quit using people for selfish gain. Tevis & Rossen state it takes character to overcome those early base animal instincts and to find inside ourselves there is more than raw physical talent that makes us winners. How many times have you read about a sports team `They have no character.'It could be anything other than a pool game; business `brick laying' `a jockey.'  The most telling statement was delivered by the character Bert Gordon (George C. Scott) to  Fast Eddie (Paul Newman) after Eddie's ego got him humbled, and his thumbs broken, hustling suckers.  ` This( read - life) isn't football, you don't get paid for yardage.' Just count the cash. And isn't that life in 1999? Just count the cash.  There are so many dialogue lines that that just hammer the senses.  Like "" You know what beat you Eddie? Character.""But there is another side to this. Because as Fast Eddie Felsen states (Paraphrasing.)...If I take that then she never lived she never died.... Eddie doesn't sellout to cash, he already sold out a greater value, too late does he realize it, and finds some pride gained through newly found inner strength. Character, maybe?Yeah Eddie there is more than cash and technical talent to life.The acting, absolutely brilliant. Newman's best. He had the game face and demeanor of a dominant aggressor.  Everything in this movie is what life is : Power. It is at times subtle, linear, abstract, existential (They wear masks Eddie.) Piper Laurie delivers fragility and vulnerability better than Leigh in `Streetcar.'  Scott is the loser and is stunning in role.  Gleason is the mountain of a man Newman had to `climb' over to get to the top.  It is all here in one superlative package of cinematic art.The best ever."
"The Hustler (1961) **** (out of 4) 'Fast' Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) shows up to play the legendary Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason) in a game of pool and soon the hotshot realizes that there's more to winning than just talent. After some time off the hustler winds up with a woman (Piper Laurie) who suffers from alcohol abuse but even worse is when he teams up with a gambler (George C. Scott).Robert Rossen's THE HUSTLER is without question one of the greatest films of its type. Most people are connected to it because of its story of a hustler and the gambling aspect but there are some of the greatest performances you're ever going to see on display here as well as a pretty depressing look at losers. Throughout the movie Felson is constantly called a loser, which is a term that fits the majority of the characters in this rather grim, dark and depressing film.For me the greatest thing here are the performances with Newman easily leading the way. It's easy to see why this is the film that turned Newman into a superstar. Up until this point he had played a fair share of troubled rebels but everything in him just came together for this role. He's certainly very believable as this young guy who can't seem to stay out of his own way when it comes to trouble. This is a very troubled character and the actor perfectly nails every aspect of it. Gleason will always be known as a comedic actor but he could nail drama when he needed and this is the perfect example. It certainly doesn't hurt that the two actors were also great pool players and this brings a real nature to the film.Laurie is rather heart-breaking in her role as the drunk and then you've got Scott playing one of the biggest snakes in film history. There's no question that his Burt character is one of the great villains in film history. Myron McCormick is excellent in his small role and then you've got a young Murray Hamilton. THE HUSTLER also benefits from some wonderful cinematography that perfectly captures this pool world. I mean, has there ever been a better example of why B&W is so great? Add in the terrific score and you've really got something special.THE HUSTLER is a classic film that constantly gets better each time you view it."
"This is one America's best dramas.  The acting and story are excellent, with some of the finest artists working both in front of and behind the camera. Even those areas that are weak in this film are part of the over-all excellence of the movie. I saw this thinking I would be watching a 'billiards movie', but was met by a solid drama that could be about a card player, a musician, a weight lifter, or a dancer.  It's about people being the best at their artistic occupation and the human struggles they go through. This is one to see if you like acting, stories, or gritty scenes.  It's all here, along with some stars and some action. Truly a worthwhile investment of time to watch."
"This is the movie of all movies to me. I have been a pool hustler since i was 16, and this movie is the most realistic portrayal of the art ever captured on film. The Camera Views are beautiful and the action is intense. Paul Newman made his permanent mark in the industry with this movie right here. Jackie Gleason plays the great pool shark ""Minnesota Fats"". He does a wonderful job of playing the pool halls top dog. He never shows the hand he has or the cards he's about to play. He is very very cool under pressure and you can feel the ice in his veins.  Fast Eddie better watch out because he is about to play the most important game of his life. Never before have I been so impressed with one movie in every way. This is a top notch film that could be enjoyed by all. Please take the time to watch it. If you like this one also check out ""The Color of Money"" very good movie!"
"The Hustler had the misfortune to be up against films like West Side Story and Judgment at Nuremberg in 1961. Another year it might have carried away more Academy gold than just for black and white cinematography and for black and white art&set direction.A lot of people think The Hustler is about pool, what it really is about is obsession at being the best and how it can cost you in other things that really matter.Paul Newman as Eddie Felson is one such obsessed creature. He wants to be the best pool player ever. To do that in the words of that eminent 20th century philosopher Ric Flair, ""to be the man, you got to beat the man.""The man is Jackie Gleason playing the legendary Minnesota Fats, champion pool player of all. They have a marathon match in which Newman seems to have the upper hand, but Gleason pulls it out in the end. Nevertheless Newman comes to the attention of George C. Scott, a gambler who wants to use him for his own ends.Jackie Gleason and George C. Scott both got nominated in the Best Supporting Actor category, but lost to George Chakiris in West Side Story. Scott is a dangerous and malevolent figure, he was probably at his most evil on the screen in this role. Piper Laurie got an Oscar nomination for Best Actress and this turned out to be her career role. She's an alcoholic floozy with some dreams that keep her ego afloat, but she loves and respects Newman. They complement each other's needs and Newman finds that out way too late. Laurie unfortunately lost to Sophia Loren in Two Women.But what I liked best about The Hustler is the contrast between Paul Newman and Jackie Gleason. Gleason is on screen at the beginning and at the end. Note how he sits apart from everyone in the pool room. No social life, no people in his orbit, it's lonely at the top. And to stay there Gleason dedicates himself to pool to the exclusion of everything else.Yet this is who the ambitious, but very vulnerable Newman wants to be. In creating his character Newman gave it equal doses of ambition and vulnerability, both working at the same time. Not an easy thing to do, but Newman is at the top of his game as Eddie Felson. Sadly Newman lost the Oscar that year to Maximilian Schell in Judgment at Nuremberg.But eventually some 25 years later Paul Newman got the Oscar for playing a more mature Eddie Felson in The Color of Money. A kind of justice, certainly few players ever get that kind of opportunity again.The Hustler was also up for Best Picture and Best Director for Robert Rossen. It lost to West Side Story in both categories. Both films hold up well after almost half a century, that was a tough call for Academy voters.The Hustler is about pool the way Moby Dick is about a whale. And there both classics."
"Robert Rossen's ""The Hustler"" is widely considered to be one of the greatest films of all time, and I would eagerly agree. Although it may seem dated on first inspection, it still contains rather subtle (or not-so-subtle) elements of sex, alcoholism, violence and drug abuse -- although it doesn't ""show"" all of these things, it certainly implies it. ""The Hustler"" is one of the key films of the 1960s and paved the way for the controversial, mature cinema of the late 1960s and 1970s. In an era when color comedies starring Rock Hudson and Doris Day were flooding the cinemas, ""The Hustler"" -- shot in grim black-and-white -- carries an aroma of steamy sensuality and visual decadence that helps to retain its classic status to this day.""The Hustler"" follows the young ""Fast"" Eddie Felson (Paul Newman), a pro pool player renowned for never losing a game. When he goes up against Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason), his pride pays a price and he loses everything. Meanwhile he falls in love with the seductive Sarah (Piper Laurie), an addict who pulls Eddie down into her world. And he strikes a contract with the seedy manager Bert (George C. Scott) in order to regain his composure and take on Minnesota Fats again.""The Hustler"" follows the routine sports-film formula: Our hero loses, falls in love, trains again and goes up against the ""villain"" of the film (who, in this case, are probably two people -- Minnesota Fats AND George C. Scott). This approach can be seen in just about any sports film, particularly ""Rocky"" which would be released over a decade later.But like ""Rocky,"" at the core of ""The Hustler"" is an examination of a man, and not the sport. This is a character-driven piece that uses pool as a backdrop to the human conflict.Fast Eddie Felson is one of cinema's deepest characters (his evolution in ""Color of Money,"" based on his wisening experiences here, particularly satisfying and realistic). ""The Hustler"" portrays Fast Eddie before he matures into the older man we see in Martin Scorsese's belated sequel -- this is great because it only complements the story and character's continuation.Some people have complained that the movie becomes too ""bogged down"" in its middle and focuses on the home-life of Fast Eddie with his girlfriend. Although I initially felt the same, and do feel it probably is a bit too long at times, it's important to remember that this is supposed to be a character study, not a sports film (as the DVD documentary claims many people misjudge it as).As a sports-themed film, ""The Hustler"" is very good. As a character-driven motion picture, it is one of the best of its kind and a true classic with some of the most steamy b & w visuals ever captured on film. Highly recommended!"
"The performances, the settings, the story, the dialogue, the characters...this movie has it all.  How it sat on the shelf for so long before it came to DVD is beyond me. A tough, gritty, intense, complicated movie that I rank among the finest ever made.  This move preceded ""L.A. Confidential"" as the bridesmaid to an over-rated movie.  The Hustler had the unfortunate luck of being released the same year as ""West Side Story"". The B/W film only adds to the flavor and tone of the movie."
"""The Hustler"" was criticized by Variety when it came out for being too realistic, making it boring. If that was true at the time (and judging from the Oscar nominations, I would have some doubts), it's what makes it endure so well. This movie is smooth, nothing seems dated. The acting isn't theatrical or too ""Method,"" there are no big moments where someone flips out. Made today, this movie would be just as good, although I wonder if someone would have the patience just to let things be, the way Rossen does here.The opening sets the tone: the opening music behind the freeze-frame credits. The score by Kenyon Hopkins, who hasn't done much more than ""12 Angry Men,"" has a stressed yet sleepy, jazzy style and a minimal quality. The movie is similar. It's quiet and forceful. The actors make use of the lack of words, and make the best of the words when they have them (""You owe me money!""). Of course, it doesn't hurt that all four of the main characters are terrific. It's where Newman, in one of his greatest anti-establishment roles, became a truly respected actor and not just someone from the Actors Studio who looked good in an undershirt (he still does). He's like a more human Marlon Brando -- not as volcanic, but more realistic.
For the supporting players, Scott, as the man who wants a piece of Fast Eddie Felson (Newman), the hot new kid, is at his very best (early in the film he makes moving a chair seem utterly compelling). Gleason, as the legendary Minnesota Fats, has few words (and making appearances only at the opening and closing, his performance is almost like an extended cameo) but that makes him all the more memorable. He doesn't need to talk -- this guy's got tenure (he's also the film's heart and soul). Piper Laurie, as Sarah, Eddie's girl, is partly a mystery. She's an alcoholic and she has some troubles, but we don't know much else about her. Her interactions with Newman are superb and their relationship grows believably; by the end of the movie (well, not quite the end, I guess), they're nowhere near where they began.In the first pool game, we can't help but smile when we look at Newman. He talks tough and because of it we expect him to lose. Throughout the film he has some looks of disappointment that are genuine and perfectly timed.Eddie's partner, Charlie, adds something to the film, as well. We don't know exactly how to feel about him. Does he think of Eddie as a son or as someone to generate money? He's getting old and would like some financial security, but he's not a bad guy. He's not vicious the way Scott is. There is a really small cast at work here. The only other person I feel I should mention is James Findley, the rich Kentucky billiards player that Eddie goes to beat. He plays his character as an effeminate southerner and it worked well. He's an elegant (probably gay) man that gives the film a little something else.Some of the personal moments between Newman and Laurie get longish, but with the appearances of Scott, the movie is immediately recharged. And sometimes it's enough to simply watch Newman -- the man couldn't look bad if he tried (the dinner scene - my God).I don't know much abut pool or billiards, but through and through this movie had me convinced. The pool shots are handled well, and I liked that we are shown more the players' technique and their face as they shoot, rather than the trick shots themselves.This is a serious movie -- for anyone who loved the poker scene in ""The Sting"" (which I see as a pleasant, but over-valued, crowd-pleasing entertainment that required Newman to do little more than strip down to his natural charm), this offers a more honest take. The hustles here aren't about a smile and a giggle, they actually mean something. The stakes are big here -- it's not just the money Eddie's playing for.""The Hustler"" is a hardboiled American classic and one to see in widescreen -- it will suffer on TV. If you're looking for a classic with some class -- business as usual -- here she is. ""That's the way it's done.""****"
"The Hustler ; is one of the greatest movies &#305; have seen.Especially Paul Newman's performance was great.I am trying to translate the subtitle of this movie to Turkish Language, but it hurts when I see the magic words which has more powerful the performances of actors or the famous of this film. No you're not a loser Eddie....and you will never be the one and only winner...And I just wonder what does the Hustler real mean on this movie.Searching the online slang dictionaries and, try to find out a meaning from the comments of the other voters.I just couldn't say to Eddie's character the Hustler as mean as the crook, or swindler, cheater means.If anybody wants to help me to find out the real Hustler word mean for this movie, I will appreciated it....Best Regards Ufuk CANKOY"
"Movies like The Hustler are a reminder that film CAN BE a true art form. The writing, direction and acting perfomances are flawless and inspired. There are about 15 films that I cannot resist watching each time they come on TV.  This is one of them.  It is simply one of the best movies ever made."
"Incredibly strained and ambitious, every scene feels either like a fight is about to erupt or a fight does erupt. The acting is hammy, and aside from Jackie Gleason's engagingly laid back Minnesota Fats, most of the performances are strident and strenuous, and don't stand the test of time.There are too many parallels with On the Waterfront, A Face In the Crowd, and probably even Somebody up There Likes Me, for comfort, or at least my comfort, as I continually had a feeling of deja vu while watching this film, which at times feels like a pastiche of better, earlier movies.For all this, the film has its virtues. Eugene Schuftan's photography is one. There are scenes in bus stations, on city streets, and cheap apartments that capture a certain neglected aspect of the urban sixties that wasn't to show up again on screen for many years, till Schlesinger's Midnight Cowboy, by which time things had changed a good deal. Marginal lives, much less places, are seldom shown honestly in movies, with the bark off, so to speak, and no sentimentality. Here director Robert Rossen shows himself to be once more the brilliant and compassionate New Dealer he was in earlier days, and as sharp an observer of human life as ever there was."
"'The Hustler' treats pool not just as a game, but as a self- destructive addiction of the protagonist Eddie Felson. The film is about character or more specifically about the development of character. It's about a character coming to realise what's really important in life. Robert Rossen commits to making Eddie a very complicated character who has both positive as well as negative traits. This is why, the character arc that he undergoes seems very effective. Phil Newman is charismatic as well as extremely emotive in his portrayal. What I also like about the film is the treatment of the character of Sarah. On one hand, she isn't the damsel in distress who is supposed to be saved by Eddie. But on the other hand, neither is she the pixie dream girl who is perfect and the fantasy girlfriend from a male perspective. Just like Eddie, Sarah is a complex character who is given requisite amount of importance and attention by Rossen. Piper Laurie's performance is really really great. There is a particular scene in the film where Eddie and Sarah attend a party. There is a particular tracking shot in that scene(which is marked by extremely loud music) where the camera is on Sarah as she walks towards the camera with Eddie visible at the background talking to another woman. The facial expressions and general demeanour of Laurie in this scene is absolutely heartbreaking. My only little gripe with the film is the treatment of character of Bert Gordon. Performance wise, George C. Scott delivers a good performance which exudes authority and charisma. But unfortunately, the Mephistopheles-esque aura that the character is supposed to personify(this symbolism gets explicitly verbalised in the film) doesn't get enough build up and I didn't really feel his influence on Eddie to be as strong as the film wants us to feel. Overall, 'The Hustler' is a really impressive film that revolves around a sport, but is mainly about character ala 'Raging Bull'."
"If Paul Newman wasn't already a star, The Hustler would have made him one overnight. ""Fast"" Eddie is a Paul Newman trademark role: smart, quick, sexy, and just as likable as he is bad. Newman has played this character many times, and it never gets old. This time around, he plays a pool hustler who gets himself into trouble by challenging a well-known pool master when he's still small-time.Even if you don't know the rules of pool, The Hustler will hold your hand and explain the rules to you so you don't feel lost by the time the major game sequences start. If you already know and love the game, you'll find yourself in heaven while watching this movie. It's a total classic, full of drama, tension, and a steamy romance that's easy to root for. Paul Newman gives an excellent performance, showing vulnerability in the highs and lows of performance gambling. It's worth it just to watch him, but chances are you'll probably come away liking the entire movie, too!"
"This film genuinely surprised me. I watched it out of curiosity since it appeared to be about a man playing pool and conning his opponents, but it turned out to be more than that. The cast all gave great performances and it was realistic in that it was believable. Newman gave a superb performance as a guy who was talented but too arrogant and not to bright in a way.This film had a pretty simple plot but the cast really brought it to life and gave great performances that saved the film. At first glance, ""The Hustler"" would appear to be about a man hustling pool with aid of a mentor and his girl. But the film was able to portray a story of a man conflicted on a much deeper level than one expects. Newman shows how morals are challenged and on a level, what it means to be a man. The film is more than meets the eye.The director gives us a pretty depressing story, but it was a great ""noir drama"". The film had the dark lighting and conflicted main male character with his femme fatale diverting him off his course. This film was able to capture much more than a movie of pool and I was not disappointed watching it. I would recommend this film. It was in a way your typical noir film, while being very different from typical."
"I love this film. It was the second film I saw starring Paul Newman. ""Somebody Up There Likes Me"" (1956) was the first, which is the biopic of legendary middleweight boxer Rocky Graziano. My older brother used to work in a billiards hall, and was a very good straight pool player as well. In straight pool, the table is larger and the pockets are smaller; which makes it quite difficult. It also makes you a much better player on a standard size table. In addition, a very close friend of mine's father played Willie Mosconi in an exhibition game. Mosconi, who was one of the greatest pool players of all time, does the one trick shot in the film (known as a masse shot). Other than that, Jackie Gleason (who is a brilliant player himself) and Paul Newman did all their own shots in the film."
"You get a pretty good idea where ""The Hustler"" will lead you after witnessing Paul Newman's utter defeat at the hands of pool legend Jackie Gleason (man, it's cool to watch him shoot). It's such a marathon contest that the effects are devastating. And that's only in the first 40 minutes or so, and the depths that Newman has to go to to overcome his personal demons and experience rebirth are gut-wrenching. I guess it'd qualify as spoilers to say he comes back and wins, but not the way you'd think.This is a fantastic movie - about character, not really pool - and it boasts some amazing talent. Newman, sure, but George C. Scott's a magnetic presence in an unscrupulous role. and Piper Laurie is the painful reminder of the bitter cynical undercurrent flowing beneath all of it.Outstanding.9/10"
"American film ""The Hustler"" features too many hustlers for whom winning is everything.They are so determined to win all their games that neither night not days matters to them.It is the incessant playing of the ball game which reveal their true selves.However,it is Eddie Felson played by Paul Newman who ends up outsmarting himself due to his excessive passion for pool.As far as this film is concerned, there is a lot to learn and watch for the lovers of the game.One can simply marvel at the manner in which both actors Paul Newman and Jackie Gleason play their pool shots.One would be doing tremendous damage to 'The Hustler' as a serious film by declining to comment on the way it transforms itself from a sports flick into a serious one.It achieves that effect by depicting a different ball game involving human feelings to be found in society especially in a relationship between a man and a woman.A lot of 'Sports' films who have won both critical as well as commercial acclaim have been made in Hollywood but 'The Hustler' would remain the most elegant sports film which portrayed that a player should also give equal importance to life which is found outside the game."
"The Hustler (1961)An archetypal man's movie in the poolroom. It's about power, and bluffing, and class. It really isn't about pool, or billiards, though there are some great shots by the leads, especially Paul Newman (and some great trick shots, too, not showing who is shooting them for the camera). But it is a little bit about poolrooms and poolroom ethics, and poolroom hustling.Hustling is the art of scamming, and it gets applied to pool in particular because it's a classic place to bluff your way in as a mediocre player and then win big at the end of the night. But as easy as this seems to keep an eye out for, or to avoid by playing your best no matter what, it gets to be a complicated mind game. And a game of plain old violence in the bathroom, where losers win in the end. Sort of.Jackie Gleason plays the great Minnesota Fats and does both of them justice (Gleason is stoic, sharp, and overweight, all important counterpoints to Newman's Fast Eddie). The third player is the ugliest character, the money man behind the players and ruthless, played with more restraint than usual for this actor, George C. Scott. Yes, three great male actors in a beautifully filmed, black and white, Cinemascope gem. And look for the actual ex-boxer great, the Raging Bull himself, Jake LaMotta as bartender. (No coincidence that the sequel to The Hustler and Raging Bull about LaMotta are both Scorsese's, but that's another tale.) Director Robert Rossen might be better known for some top notch screenplays, but among his other films is the great boxing story, Body and Soul (1947).As much as Newman is amazing, a defining presence in nearly every scene, it is the one woman in the movie, Newman's girl Sarah, who gives it depth and, oddly, life. Piper Laurie bounced between the stage and screen for decades before and after The Hustler, and managed two Oscar nominations in that time, including here. She not only gives her character believable depth and pathos (when she is allowed to--many scenes she's just sitting and watching), but she brings out the human side of Newman. My favorite scenes are when the two of them have something of a life together.Director Robert Rossen might be better known for some top notch screenplays, but among his other films is the great Body and Soul (1947), about boxing."
"""The Hustler"" (1961) made by Robert Rossen from a sad novel with the same title and this is still an odd movie, in which it was for the most of its duration located in a main set. Like the backstage of people surviving as they could, before they lost any opportunities for choosing their way, as searching misery by non sense of daily life in an urban surviving style at the backyards of night activity. It was this lack of poetry from such an ordinary people, nonetheless skilled and waiting for chance in their lives, that this movie wins its fame as hymn of wrong side from the consumption society of values, to the time when should fighting for more dignity in their social blindness. This is still a portrait of modern misery, with a slight touch of gangsterism in a dramatic pause for any kind of sport. Where a big guy doesn't like anymore lose whatsoever, when gambling with such a young man in the middle of night till dawn. The quality of the main prize here is having for the least his thumbs broken and a less crippled girl as lover, because she killed herself meanwhile waiting for his lost soul helping still her busy dependence.In this small universe of little corruption there, getting from the ground of bitter expectancy, as though a new kind of morality to the loser by such a convenience of the boss from his own tough underground soul, that still he - the young character of a snooker's player - will have much for learning about his ambition and ambitious career for this candid fellow here. Meanwhile, staying alive of course is enough and thinking better with such an empiric mind of daily struggle on snooker - green tableland of caves with smoking fog, sleeping in degraded hotels with cockroaches on the bed - is not so easy for instance. This movie also displays us degradation, as inside a fake luck's mentality for winning for the less an abyss by the lack of resources, even though the currency there it is not always favorable at the hands of such a young individual, in an odd match of snooker forever with apparently no way out.What can he does, on the spot's snooker with such a style, when then he was here with both hands in such a weakened condition, for would thinking to play again less better next time, with such an adversary who controls himself the gambling landscape nearby in this borough ? The scene that shows us a resigned man, watched as though with his own professional way of life cutting down for a while - out of the labor, perhaps as a new kind of vagabond from the roads - in this kind of provoked fatality in his capabilities, it is illuminated crudely with the neon on the ceiling and the shadows on the walls of such a kind of new misery, in a place where predominated individuals like some of the same generation of men without scruples nor comprehension for a young winner needing a renewed of the beginning of his life properly. This is irony about the contrast between the two gamblers, in a fake trend with the robbery of the money, as win it by the character of a gambler performed at this stage by Paul Newman in his best movie ever, it seems now. The money that is not due by the strength of the next events, it is in itself enough as symbolizing an atmosphere but quite dry on its smooth for displaying in its anodyne brutality and sordid welfare at stake in such a defeat. It was an odd story, without another immediate sequel at the same decade, like a television story later."
I bought this just recently and now I want to play pool.  Paul Newman just can't quit!!  He MUST be the best and HAS to beat Minnesota Fats (brilliantly played by JACKIE GLEASON).  This is the ROLE that Paul Newman was BORN FOR.  The role of Fast Eddie was TAYLOR MADE for Paul Newman. This is just a good ol' fun movie with some drama mixed in.  It's well shot and George C Scott delivers just as many goods as Newman.  The EXTRAS on the DVD are great.  There are some wonderful pool playing tips on the EXTRA FEATURES section.
"'Fast' Eddie Felson is a pool hustler who is small-time despite his attitude and mouth. His attitude leads him to challenge the mighty Minnesota Fats to a game of pool, a game that lasts for over 24 hours and leaves Eddie broken and broke. Eddie dumps his manager and goes back to working small poolrooms for small change, hooking up with an alcoholic girlfriend who he met in a bus station and settling into life on the bottom.Widely regarded as a classic, it has been a few years since I last saw this film (well  almost a decade) so I decided to rewatch it in order to be able to review it properly rather than just writing off from memory. The film opens well with the scenes that are the strongest of the film  the hustling scenes in the poolrooms. However once the film gets past Eddie's emasculation by Minnesota Fats it enters into it's middle section where we watch Eddie slowly hit rock bottom before starting to try and get up again. It is this section that takes up most of the running time and it is this section that contains many of the film's weaknesses. As Eddie falls deeper, the film trades in its atmospheric style for something more akin to social realism. Given that this is the gut of the film it is a major problem that it really fails to engage to the same degree that the other parts do. It feels a little dated and obvious and, although it still works, it is not effective enough drama to be worthy of it's place on so many critics' top whatever list.However the real drama works well in the pool scenes and the related bits, these are delivered with style, good dialogue and atmosphere to boot. The characters spark off each other here and at times you can feel the silence in the room as if you were there  like Eddie himself says, silent like a church. It is in these scenes where Eddie changes both times and it is therefore here that the drama works best. Of course we needed the middle section to deliver a story and give us Eddie's whole tale as opposed to some cool and stylish pool (like Scorsese mostly did) but it is overlong (it didn't need to be literally a long night of the soul!).The cast perform well and really help the film. Newman is very good even if you can see that he knows this is a good role for him  the odd time you could see he was showboating a little but he mostly kept his performance accessible and under control. Laurie has less to work with and is merely a driver for Eddie's actions at the end and a comfort for him in their shared destruction; her performance is OK but she is left to carry the weight of the film's middle section. Scott is good despite only being in part of the film while Gleason and Hamilton are both fine in small roles.Overall I felt pressure to really love this film because it is a classic and so highly regarded by the majority of critics. While I did love parts of it and liked it on the whole, I didn't think the main middle section was really that good  it got itself bogged down and delivered too little over too long a time. It still works sort of but it isn't good enough as a story to be worthy of such high praise as it is often given. The pool scenes are really well done and it is here where we see just how stylish, gripping and interesting the film can be as the characters really spark off each other with a palatable tension but sadly, for me, these scenes only served to show up the middle sections failings all the more. A good film but for my money not a great one."
"This was a famous movie in its day and one I have remembered well since I first saw it. Then I viewed it on TV once or twice in the '70s and it was still enjoyable. For that, it gets points. However, looking at the film in 1999 after many years without seeing it, it didn't hold the fascination anymore. In fact, it was downright unpleasant to watch, too sleazy an atmosphere for me.The main characters, except for Jackie Gleason as ""Minnesota Fats,"" are all unlikable people. Gleason was fascinating but Paul Newman (""Fast Eddie""), the supposed ""hero"" of the film, was an arrogant punk; Piper Laurie was a drunk with an irritatingly horrible voice, and George C. Scott was a crude low-life.As for the billiards angle of the story, that was very good. However, the sordidness of the romance, which was not a pretty thing to see, ruined the film for me. This is simply too much of a downer. Who wants to get depressed?"
"No need to recap the plot.Despite the hype of the time and Newman in a tailor-made role, the movie is spotty at best. Altogther, there may be 90-minutes of usable material, but stretched to over 2-hours, the pacing drags, particularly in the middle part. Writer-director Rossen inserts too many unnecessary pauses long after we've gotten the idea. For example, Sarah's (Laurie) alcoholic stagger down a city street goes on for a minute when 10-seconds would suffice. Then there are the many dialog pauses in the Eddie-Sarah conflabs. These may imitate life, but here they simply drag out the scenes pointlessly. Maybe if Sarah had more than a single drearily predictable personality, there might be more interest to the scenes and what she says. However, as things stand, her one-note character blows a hole right through the movie's middle.The film's strength lies in a raft of colorful supporting players, including the underrated Murray Hamilton who injects just the right amount of oily decadence into his Southern gentleman. Newman at the time was one of Hollywood's hottest properties. His rebellious role here was a near perfect fit for what would become his definitive screen image, though I agree that his Fast Eddie is not very likable and without the compensatory charm of a Hud or Cool Hand Luke.If my little review seems weighted with negatives, it's because I think the movie's overrated, and needs some deflation. Reputations can sometimes be misleading, especially now that the initial hype has worn off. At the same time, the hype was somewhat understandable since Hollywood was promoting more adult features like this one to escape the deadening hand of 1950's conformity. At its best, The Hustler's a good series of colorful character studies; at its least, however, it's slow and repetitive and far short of a classic.(In passing— for a sports movie, the action here is an oddity. Most sports films mine the moment-to-moment suspense of a crucial play. But there's none of that here. That is, we get no close-ups of crucial moments when winning or losing is in the balance. Rather, the detail in the games between Fast Eddie and Fats is skipped over in cursory fashion. The narrative's only interested in the overall outcome without playing up the suspense. I suspect that's because the rules of pool are not widely known, plus the action itself is too visually chaotic for an audience to easily follow. Anyway, I found the absence unusual for a sports movie.)"
"This movie is a classic - every single aspect of it works: the direction, the cinematography, the acting (Newman and Scott are great) and its story is superb...Firstly, it has to do with one of the greatest sports of all time - pool - and manages to capture the exact feelings that a player has (when Newman explains how the cue stick becomes one with your arm is very accurate)... The best scene (if you exclude the pool scenes) is the ""greatness speech"" that Newman gives to Sarah - proclaiming that ""anything can be great""...The next best scene is the closing scene - actually the opening scene is also very good.... anyways see the movie all the scenes are great - a true classic... extremely recommendable for pool junkies"
"People more eloquent than I have made some recent and perceptive comments about this film, so I can only echo some of what has been said...I enjoyed the stark and crisp black and white cinematography. And enjoyed Newman's moving portrayal of the talented, but undisciplined, Eddie.Eddie's romance with Sarah was a weak link in this film, and the middle part of the movie dragged as a result. The classic Minnesota Fats scenes, on the other hand, sandwiched the romance and really held my interest and (in my humble opinion) were much more central to the overall story.(This movie, along with Hombre and The Verdict, is part of the Paul Newman Collection DVD set)"
"When you are comparing first rate movies and trying to pick the very best of the very best, `The Hustler' must be in the running, and when you make comparisons you should remember Fast Eddie Felson's challenge, `That's right, it's my turn to shoot.  When I miss, then you can shoot.'  And this movie never does miss.  It is one of those cosmic events where everything was in the right place at the right time on the right day.  Casting, acting, direction, camera work, sets, editing, flavor and smell: all perfect.Paul Newman is absolute perfection in the role of Fast Eddie Felson as he shows how ego and naiveté can work against each other to first destroy and rebuild character.  When viewed against Jackie Gleason's Minnesota Fats he is almost touchingly vulnerable.  `Pay him.  I can't beat him.' is Fats' exit line.  Just another hard days work for him, the consummate professional.  Eddie has destroyed everything for his one moment at the top, and he knows it, and Newman makes sure that we know it, too.  All of which would be just a little too heavy handed and metaphoric if it weren't for George C Scott's, Bert Gordon.  Bert is the ultimate utilitarian cynic.  He is pulling the strings, or thinks he is.  His only flaw ends up being his inability to truly judge the inner being of someone as elusive as Fast Eddie.My only complaint with this movie is that they should have given `Star Billing' to the poolroom.  It is like no other place on earth.  Not because it is physically unique. It isn't, but it is where the best come.  It is not a mighty arena where great pageants are staged and tremendous throngs cheer the victors.  `This is Ames', Mister.'  This is where you win, not to please the crowd, but just to win.  Winning has a high price for Fast Eddie, far higher than the price Minnesota Fats pays for loosing or Burt Gordon pays for backing him.We know how the movie ends, but we don't know how the story ends, and we wonder what becomes of the characters.  What is most surprising about watching this movie is realizing that we care about the characters in the end.  That is a great compliment to any movie, one of the highest.  This is of course the parable of an art form corrupted into a status symbol and a quest for glory, but don't let that stop you from watching it.  It is also a marvelous evenings entertainment."
"The Hustler is seen as a well respected, getting Oscar nominations and making Paul Newman's name as an actor. Here is a film noir style film with gritty, flawed characters, looking at working class culture. It made during a great period of cinema.The film tells the story of a small time pool hustler, Fast Eddie Felson (Paul Newman), who had been traveling around America, making a lot of money and wanting to challenge Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason), the best pool player in America. After initial success, Fats beats Eddie, with him being battered and beaten. He ends up forming a relationship with an alcoholic woman, Sarah (Piper Laurie), a woman who is beaten down by life. They both help each other and seem in love, but Eddie does the only thing he can do, hustle, getting himself in dangerous. In a bar Eddie meets Bert Gordon (George C. Scott), a gambler who offers to back Eddie up and give him his chance to beat Fats.The film is considered by some a sports movie, but the film isn't. It is a character drama, it is about the broken American dream (like the writer John Steinbeck focused on). Many of the characters are flawed in some way. Eddie is a very arrogant character, who doesn't know where to stop and is almost on the path to self-destruction. Sarah is an alcoholic, who has given up on her dreams. Bert Gordon is a user, a man who only thinks of his own self-interest, an good villain. The Hustler strongest element is the acting, with top performance from all the actors. They made you believe in their characters. The director, Robert Rossen, does a good job, using fading shots, strong fixed shots, adding to the atmosphere and does well filming the pool scenes.They are some problems with the film. It is a little too long and seems unfocused. Just cutting a few minutes properly would have made this a better film.I personally the grim and gritty reality that this film sets out. This is a worthy film from the film noir school."
"I've heard people calling ""The Hustler"" the ""best sports movie ever"", and although the movie has some fascinating pool-playing scenes for the fans of the game, it hits me as, above all, a gripping character study. Paul Newman's Fast Eddie Felson is as brilliant at his game as he is self-destructive. His relationship with a loving but troubled woman (Piper Laurie) is shattered by Eddie's cross: ambition and love of the game over other important life decisions. Newman and Laurie deliver outstanding performances as always (the scene when they meet for the first time is classic); Jackie Gleason and George S. Scott (all of them were Oscar nominated) are not much behind. From Felson to ""Hud"" to ""Cool Hand Luke"", Paul Newman made a career of brilliant outsiders. With his stunning beauty, he could have been just another leading man from Hollywood's Golden Age, but he went beyond. Newman's one of the few stars that had (wait, he still has!) it all: an amazing talent, beauty, charisma, and integrity. ""The Hustler"" is one of the big screen legend's finest moments; don't miss it. 10/10."
"Paul Newman stars as ""The Hustler,"" a fantastic film that costars George C. Scott, Piper Laurie, and Jackie Gleason. It's the story of a young man, Eddie (Newman) who makes his living as a pool shark. Then he meets three people who will change his life: Minnesota Fats (Gleason), Bert Gordon (Scott), and Sarah (Laurie). Both Gordon and Sarah see the man that Eddie can be - but they're seeing different things. Which man he will become remains to be seen at the beginning of the film.This is a gritty, black and white movie that takes place in pool halls, cheap hotels, and rooming houses for the most part. The people populating it are drunks, hustlers, parasites, and desperate people. Eddie is a young guy obsessed with winning, money, and taking down Minnesota Fats. Gordon is a gambler who bets on men, staking them with his money and taking their souls in return. Laurie is a lonely, lame alcoholic who falls for Eddie but finds him distant and preoccupied. They all play their parts as he learns what the game of life is all about for real.There's no question that even if he had not made some of the films he did, Paul Newman would have become a tremendous star. He's a magnificent actor, magnetic, and handsome to boot. But he probably owes a couple of his films to the death of James Dean - ""Somebody Up There Likes Me"" was definitely one, and more than likely this would have been another. Both men, of course, had the talent and unique sets of qualities to enable them to make a role their own, and Newman plays this complex role beautifully. In some scenes, his character will not permit any emotion to show, but toward the end of the film, faced with a tragedy, his whole body gives way as if someone has just hit him in the stomach with a boulder. The great thing about Newman is, despite his tremendous fame, you always forget it's Newman and become involved with the part he's playing. 25 years later, this role would win him the Oscar he should have received the first time around. Well, better late than never.George C. Scott is great as Gordon. In the case of Gordon, he has a put-on persona - but when the real Gordon comes through, it's scary. Your heart goes out to Laurie's character through her touching and very strong performance as a pathetic woman whose life is isolated and stuck in a bottle.Each actor in the film has a difficult role to play, as there are no one-dimensional characters, and each actor cast has amazing ability. Probably few actors or performers ever had the ability of Jackie Gleason. As Minnesota Fats, he projects a rock-solid persona that takes over the screen - and he does it with precious little to say. The expression on his face, the way he sits, tell you everything you need to know.Stunningly directed by Robert Rossen, ""The Hustler"" is a no-miss but only if you want to see great acting and a compelling story."
"This drama about an up-and-coming pool hustler was said to be the model for all the formulaic sports movies, like ""Rocky"" and ""The Karate Kid"", that have appeared since. But ""The Hustler"" is different from it's imitators due to a tragic, ironic edge to its plot. Whilst it's a popular saying that every loser wins, the hero of this film learns the hard way that sometimes when you win, you lose.Fast Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) is a young, arrogant pool shark regularly playing other would-be glory hunters for up to thousands of dollars a game. Eddie's ambition is take on and beat the long-time pool champion Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason). But in his first match with Fats, Eddie gets too cocky and his rival gets the better of him. Obsessed with getting a return match, Eddie gets involved with a sleazy manager (George C.Scott) who tries to develop in Eddie the 'character' necessary to defeat Fats. Things are complicated when Eddie falls in love with a lonesome alcoholic Sarah (Piper Lawrie), an affair that eventually leads to tragedy...The film succeeds through a flowing blend of great acting and tight scriptwork. Although the film meanders inconsequentially through it's love story, the performances and memorable dialogue ('Fat man you shoot a great game of pool') ensure an engaged viewer. Pool fans too will enjoy the array of trick shots on display here. Paul Newman was taught by billiards legend Willie Mosconi, while Gleason himself was already a very telented pool player.Paul Newman is on top form as the talented but tortured Eddie, while Piper Lawrie engenders sympathy as his fragile, weak-willed girlfriend. George C.Scott is brilliantly dislikeable as Eddie's scheming manager, while Jackie Gleason plays Minnesota Fats with a quiet subtlety. In his hands the pool king is not really a villain, but just an honest, hardworking professional.Despite it's slow pace at times, this is still an immensely enjoyable, well-acted drama. ""The Hustler"" spawned a sequel over twenty years later with ""The Colour of Money"" (1986)."
"Great B/W cinematography, interesting story, and host of fascinating performances. Paul Newman as Fast Eddie in one of his best roles of his youth. Ambitious, selfish, and good at what he does, Eddie finds out more about himself than he wanted to know and Newman is perfect. Piper Laurie is touching and tragic as the damaged Sarah. Jackie Gleason is composed and stylish as the Fat Man. Myron McCormick is completely authentic as Eddie's manager. George C. Scott is incredible as the gambler Burt and relishes his power over people.A 10 out of 10. Best performance = Mr. Scott. I think Rossen only made one more film after this (LILITH). The editor is the great Dede Allen (BONNIE & CLYDE). Should have won Best Picture and many other awards, but '61 was the year of WEST SIDE STORY. Great Stuff!"
"Watching this film, you have to keep asking yourself, how did Newman not win the Academy for his performance. Newman gives a great, self destructive performance as ""Fast"" Eddy Felsen, a pool shark, trying to find his way. However, there are many great performances in this film. George C. Scott as a shark of his own, and Jackie Gleason as the legendary ""Minnesota Fats"". Top actors at the top of their games, it does not get any better. **** out of *****."
"Well-acted masterpiece which has Paul Newman (Oscar-nominated) as the young hot-head who wants to hustle all comers at the pool table. He is the best, no doubt about it, but his cockiness and his inability to see the ""big picture"" will lead to tragedy on more than one occasion. He shows that he is better than the excellent Minnesota Fats (played brilliantly in a short role by Oscar-nominee Jackie Gleason), but being the best is not good enough for Newman and he sinks himself. Oscar-nominee George C. Scott then takes Newman along with him to hustle high-class players, but Newman's naivety and lack of intelligence do not help out his situation. ""The Hustler"" is also a love story as Newman and Oscar-nominee Piper Laurie self-destruct as Newman cannot control himself and Laurie cannot control a terrible alcohol problem. Heart-rending, entertaining, fascinating and brilliant in every way, ""The Hustler"" is one of the greatest films ever produced hands down. 5 stars out of 5."
"For those of us brought up on ""The Jackie Gleason Show"" and especially ""The Honeymooners"", we thought of ""The Great One"" as a gifted comedic actor. Imagine our shock when we discovered he was a world class dramatic actor. His portrayal of Minnesota Fats ranks as one of the great acting turns in motion picture history.  Watch Gleason carefully. No mugging, no great elastic face, no punchlines, only total believability. We always knew he could play pool. It is a fact that some of the shots were done by the great Willie Masconi. Forget that, Gleason plays a one-of-a-kind character coupled with the era's hottest mail star.  Perhaps women swooned at the sight of Paul Newman, but Gleason walked away with the Oscar.  This could have been a television drama taken to the screen, ala ""Marty"", but the era of live television drama had passed.  Jackie Gleason is simply amazing. Those who knew him said he was larger than life. A/B this title with ""The Color of Money"" and I defy you to say the later version was better. It couldn't have been. The Great One didn't appear.  BTW: Check out Soldier in the Rain as Gleason stretches his acting ability even more.  Again he's teamed with a hunk of his era (Steve McQueen) and again he steals the picture. WOW!"
"It's sad to me that Paul Newman won his only Oscar for the forgettable sequel to this brilliant movie.  The Hustler is a masterpiece on so many levels.  Owing to superlative acting and direction the movie is as cool as can be.  The pool hall scenes pulse with tension and drama.  The stark soundtrack and cool dialog make the movie sparkle.Most of the cool movies today can't get beyond cool (think Tarantino). Like cotton candy the sweet taste fades in an instant.  Beneath the coolness and style of The Hustler lies a deeper theme emerges: character is about more than determination alone.  The movie is really about maturity.  But fantastically rich story with penetrating moral themes.  Midway through the movie the viewer gets it: ah, this movie is about the triumph of determination over talent.  But soon another like all good moral tales, far from preaching, the medicine goes down smooth in a deliciously entertaining spoonful."
"Viewing this film on video fifteen years after first seeing it on TV and its becoming a milestone on my way into adult life, I can´t but have understanding for disappointed viewers deriding it as dated, the acting being strident und strenuous - but it really is none of that! We are talking here about a true ""Bildungsfilm"", and Paul Newman`s arguably overacted moods (the nervous grinning, the outbursts of anger) are not the actor´s fault, but Eddie Felson`s - an adolescent thirty-something in search of character (i.e. of himself), which he eventually finds only after paying a huge price for it.If the purpose of art is the pursuit of truth, i.e. the attempt to overcome the absurdity of life in order to ""explain"" it, ""The Hustler"" can only be considered a masterpiece."
"The hustler combines action and suspense with deep character development in a movie that has drama, comedy, and action.  The quintessential hustler is played by Jackie Gleason(minnesota fats), while the arrogant young pool huslter Paul Newman(fast eddie felson), is at first hustled by the best in spite of his superior talent, for as George C. Scott(bert gordon) later tells him ""it takes more than talent to play big league pool for 40 hours straight, it takes character and thats something you don't have""  The movie develops as fast eddie realizes his lack of character and eventually finds it the hard way.  Eddie's love in the movie is Sarah, who has character problems of her own that must be overcome.  The cast is great and the story is profound, while also having its lighter moments, one of the most underrated movies of all time."
"I first saw this movie as a teen, I was heavily into Pocket Pool, Paul Newman's performance certainly deserved an Oscar, his acting was so tense and emotionally draining, a true classic.  If I watched this movie once I must have watched it 100 times or more, and when shooting pool, I used some of Paul Newman's lines as he did to throw off my opponents.Eddie Felson sacrificed all for a game or pool, to be the best there is, at such a tragic cost.Its a must see film whether you're in to shooting pool or not, his character was well developed, intense and sad to throw away everything to beat Minnesota Fats."
"The movie, the director and the four main actors in the movie were nominated for academy awards. Acting recognition in a movie hardly gets better than that. And it's a great story, too. Having read the book before seeing the movie when it came out I wondered what would be changed, but as I recall, it stayed faithful to the book. If you've seen The Color Of Money you owe it to yourself to watch this movie. I recommend it highly and rated it 10 out of 10."
"This is a beautiful movie.  It is one of the very best black and white films I've ever seen.  I love the intensity of each actors performance.  The contrast between the young hustler of Fast Eddie's character to the calm confidence of Minnesota Fats is depicted so artfully.  The camera angles and shots are extremely thought provoking, while at the same time it perfectly tells the story."
"Part of me thought that black and white Cinemascope was a good idea - in general it's not a BAD idea, given Cinemascope - and part of me thought that Robert Rossen needed his head examined.  The film is about a POOL hustler. All those coloured balls moving around at key moments, and he goes and shoot in black and white!  Not that the camera ever really focuses on the pool table; and, to be sure, the camera's casual attitude to the game itself feels surprisingly apt.  Anyway, it's a bit rich MY complaining.  I didn't do my homework.  I know only vaguely the difference between pool and billiards - although I'm still not sure what constitutes success in the latter - and I wouldn't have a clue how either of them differs from snooker. For all I know pool IS snooker, under another name.  I don't think my ignorance was a problem.  ""The Hustler"" offers a satisfying story told at a satisfying length: two and a quarter hours spent on a simple fable, yet the narrative looks and feels pared to the bone.  It's amazing what some people can draw with a minimum of line.  Take the scene where Eddie meets Sarah for the first time (although I could have chosen almost any scene) - so little is said and yet the lines are perfectly placed just so, giving us a sketch full of detail.  With this kind of perfection it's impossible to know whether to credit the acting, the script, the direction, or all three - not that it matters."
"As the film's tag line states: ""Only the angel who falls, knows the depths of hell"".The Hustler follows Newman from a cocky young up-comer - learning the tricks of the 'hustling' trade, to an experienced professional - becoming 'the best there is'. 'Fast' Eddie discovers the troubles of hustling, as his life hits rock bottom. He can no longer play in any pool hall, and turns to his good friend Jim Bean, for comfort. His girlfriend (Piper Laurie), also an alcoholic, helps get his life back on track, and sets Eddie up for a memorable finale, with Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason).Raw and uncomprimising, the Hustler is a classic film of its type."
"Being a pool enthusiast, I was originally drawn to this movie by it's general theme.  But this one covers much more than that, several ""real-life"" subjects such as alcoholism, and the misunderstanding most people have of the disease and the frequent mistreatment of its sufferers.  And as always, it's interesting to see, even if dramatized, life on the ""other side"", the darker side.  Great supporting cast, heartfelt performances by all.  I've viewed this one more than once and feel it's a necessary addition to any serious collection."
"Okay, this movie was all about pool, but I was told it was a good one, so I put it in the VCR last night and dared to press play. Only to find out I should NEVER judge. Newman was excellent in his role as Eddy. Made me feel the pressure he felt and the emotions he felt. Gleason was good in a serious role. Never saw him in a dramatic role before. Great film. Can't wait to see Color of Money now."
Paul Newman and Jackie Gleason give an oustanding performance in this classic movie! Being an avid pool player myself I must watch this movie at least 5 times a week!! I don't think anyone could've asked for a better performance from either of these two great actors!!
"One of the best movies ever made. I can think of none better. Paul Newman, Jackie Gleason & George C. Scott all were tremendous. The kind of movie you can see over and over. Watch the movie and then go and shoot pool; You'll play  200% better, at least temporarily. Look for Willie Mosconi !"
"When Paul Newman got his teeth into a role he could really deliver. Nobody else could have handled roles like the leads in ""Cool Hand Luke,"" ""Hud,"" ""The Verdict,"" or this, his first major effort, ""The Hustler."" Not to say that Newman's performance makes the movie because ALL of the major performances are superb, as is the direction by Robert Rossen, the script by Rossen and Sidney Caroll, and the jazzy blues score by Kenyon Hopkins. Even the set dressing couldn't be much improved. This one is a winner.Newman is ""Fast Eddie"" Felson from Oakland, California, who comes to New York to play the reigning king of the game of pool, ""Minnesota Fats"", done to a turn by Jackie Gleason in a dramatic part. The initial contest drags on for twenty-five hours. Newman, a small-time hustler, is as talented as Gleason but he drinks recklessly and becomes over confident, fatigued, and careless. He loses everything he'd won when the game began.Cutting a long story short, Newman ditches his sensible old partner, Myron McCormick, meets a lame alcoholic, Piper Laurie, and moves in with her. Laurie falls very convincingly in love with Newman but his attitude towards her is casual, sometimes callous. Failing at local hustling and getting his thumbs broken in the process, Newman comes under the tutelage of gambler George C. Scott. Scott had made a good deal of money off Newman's losing the bout with Gleason, which Scott attributes to a lack of character. There is an immediate antipathy between Laurie and Scott. She sees Scott as a materialist with no soul, and he sees her as structurally weak, which she is. Scott wins the contest but Newman acquires ""character"" in addition to talent, and in the final match up, he beats Gleason flat, then leaves town alone.It's a tragic story. Newman may ""win"" in the end but Laurie loses everything in order to make that victory possible. Newman's character arc is clear. He begins as a cold-blooded hustler, using everyone to advance his standing in the game's hierarchy. He dumps his old friend and partner, McCormick, and chooses to play a game of billiards with the effete Murray Hamilton over leaving with Piper Laurie. By the end of the film he is almost destroyed and willingly gives up big-time pool, which is not a bad idea since his achievement, in beating Gleason, was stunning. What could he do for an encore? I kept waiting for some trap door to open and have the whole enterprise collapse but it never happened. (The deck sagged only once, during the final shoot out between Newman and Gleason, when Newman spells everything out for an audience that, in its infinite maturity, must already understand.)It's hard to believe that Piper Laurie once played third fiddle to Francis the Talking Mule or Elvis Presley the Singing King. She's not the cloyingly sweet cutie from the early 1950s. She's worn -- just enough. She doesn't play the character of the drunken slut flatly either. She brings nuance to the part. Her voice is a mellow contralto and has peculiar and unpredictable ups and down, and often she turns her face from the person she's speaking to and looks at him from the sides of her eyes. It doesn't come across as an acting trick. It seems more like the kind of habit we might find in someone we know. When she tells Newman in an firm declarative statement that she loves him, and Newman looks away embarrassed, we find that scene familiar too.Murray Hamilton's ultra-wealthy gentleman gambler is likewise outstanding. The photography has given us some angles of Scott that lend him a Satanic cast. Hamilton gives Scott some curious regard then turns to look at a statuette of a satyr, or perhaps its Bacchus or Pan, and remarks that Scott could have modeled for the sculptor. (Scott stares at it for a few seconds then says, ""It's possible."") And when Hamilton loses a bundle of money to Newman and Scott during a game of billiards, he gives new meaning to the descriptive adjective ""shaken."" But there isn't space enough to give this movie the attention it deserves. It was, in its time, a breakthrough film for Newman, Scott, and Gleason, and it led inevitably to one or two pallid imitations like ""The Cincinnati Kid."" Fats and Fast Eddie became icons of vernacular culture, enduring enough that Eddie was resurrected by Martin Scorcese for ""The Color of Money."" Scott repeatedly refers to Newman as a ""loser"" while Piper Laurie tells Newman he's a ""winner."" Well, in the end, Newman is a tragic winner. The film itself is a winner."
"Robert Rossen's ""The Hustler"" centers on 'Fast' Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) and his goal of beating 'Minnesota Fats' (Jackie Gleason) in a high-stakes pool game, thus proving himself to be the best there is. However, unlike most sports films, this one is equally concerned with life outside the pool hall.Paul Newman gives a standout performance as a charismatic pool hall hustler. He has exactly the right mix of charm and assurance that makes his character both likable and believable. Jackie Gleason, on the other hand, gives a nicely understated performance as 'Minnesota Fats' which is the perfect complement to Newman's brash portrayal of Felson. I was also impressed by George C. Scott's turn as manipulative gambler Bert Gordon. These three actors all received well-deserved Academy Award nominations. So did Piper Laurie as Felson's love interest, though I must admit that I wasn't completely sold on her somewhat mannered performance.The story is interesting and will certainly take you by surprise if you're expecting a cookie-cutter sports film. The matches between Felson & Fats are central to the plot but the events in between are the real guts of the picture. That being said, I do think that there was just a little too much emphasis on the non-sports elements of the film, causing it to drag slightly as a result.While none of the technical aspects of the film particularly stood out for me, the direction by Rossen is solid and so is Dede Allen's editing. Meanwhile, the cinematography & set decoration won the film its two Oscars (out of nine nominations). The jazzy score is also ideally suited to the subject matter.I particularly recommend this movie to fans of sports films though its value as a serious drama should not be underestimated. Certainly a film worthy of classic status."
"Robert Rossen created an absolute classic with this inspired drama about a pool hustler and the true value of character. Paul Newman was perfect in his role as Fast Eddie Felsen and delivered a full menu of the many sides of this character. The authentic on-scene locations were a vital part, as were the fantastic excellence of the roles played by Piper Laurie, Jackie Gleason and George C. Scott. Piper Laurie had withdrawn from movies for several years demanding not more money but rather a substantive role. Thus her portrayal of the alcoholic and lame Sarah Packard, the finest role she ever played. Likewise TV superstar Jackie Gleason stars in his first movie and puts aside his comic side to deliver a restrained and excellent portrayal of Minnesota Fats. A new actor named George C. Scott would find his career built on his role as the bad guy. JTS Brown bourbon was put on the map by this picture. People were ordering it left and right after hearing Newman's demands for it. (Minor spoiler) So many quotes on this website, but not this one. Newman has suggested that he get a bottle and take Sarah Packard take him home. She agrees. At the door: SARAH: Why me? EDDIE: (A hard kiss). SARAH: You're too hungry! (She turns and enters alone). Some extra history --- Theater owners in 1961 were justly furious with 20th Century-Fox for selling the rights to 20+ prime movies for NBC'S Saturday Night at the Movies, making quality films available at home and free on the movie theaters' prime night. In revenge, THE HUSTLER was given almost no promotion or advertising in either its first or subsequent neighborhood runs, moving it quickly into a planned early death. Then along came word-of-mouth advertising and a few theaters cleverly booked and promoted re-runs after the movie's theatrical rental fees had dropped to minimal. Some theaters in my city played the re-run for 14 to 16 weeks, when just one week was normal for a hit film. One last comment: There was an unfortunate and substandard sequel made in 1986 by Martin Scorsese. Forget that one and find the original. Too bad in 2005 or 2006 not one single film comes even close to the excellence or entertainment value of ""The Hustler."""
"In this and Rossen's ""All the King's Men,"" professional success was depicted as a dubious benefit of a devil's bargain, with many unintended consequences. ""The Hustler"" may have also been intended as a depiction of labor/management relations, so ""character"" may be synonymous with swallowing your pride and submitting to ""the man."" Of course, at the time this was made, some still thought Communism was a viable alternative. For those of us who aren't political scientists, these films also offer great stories (from great novels), scripts, acting, and direction. You may have to go along to get along, or you can try to go your own way. It doesn't pay as well, but there may be fewer costs."
"The Hustler is hands down the story that most people would refer to when confronted with a pool room; unfortunately, many of these people would be referring to the movie. While it is still a classic and deserves to be on many hit lists, The Hustler (movie) takes too many liberties with the story by killing Sarah, changing Bert's character, etc. While the core of the movie was kept the same, most of the decorative wrapping that Walter Tevis (author of the book) crafted was smashed, or lines were transplanted from their original context into new ones.However, if one were to look at The Hustler (movie) by itself without taking into consideration the above mentioned issues, The Hustler is still a great movie with outstanding performances and superb casting.If you do not read the original book by Walter Tevis then you are missing out on one of the greatest stories of all time."
"Although the above review is on point in many ways, referring to Eddie Felson as a ""born loser"" is missing the point of the film. Even before the finale, Eddie experiences the type of glory that few (probably including the above poster) experience in life because he knows he's the best pool shooter/""hustler"" around. Eddie knows this subconsciously and that is why he expresses such confidence as telling Fats that he's the best Fats ever saw and that even if Fats beats him, Eddie's still the best. As Sarah points out to Eddie in their touching picnic scene, Eddie's a ""winner"" because most people never get to experience that type of confidence. Eddie doesn't have to ""own things"" to be a winner -- he's a winner because of his talent."
"Like most great works, 'The Hustler' presents behind stark simplicity (e.g. one could simply the film is about a 'loser' who makes good, just as one could say that the great book Madame Bovary is about a bored wife who commits adultery, etc.)a number of themes that are handled all the more powerfully by being either hinted at or gone into by the director using all the power of the medium: when Eddie gets back again with Sarah, not a word is said, the camera flickers over the faces, holds certain expressions for a second more, gestures are understated (they hold each other as they walk off). Dialogue is either taut (George C. Scott is great), as in Bert Gordon's very few but essential exchanges with Sarah; or, poignantly penetrating, as when Eddie opens himself about pool(wonderful expression of the supreme joy and satisfaction of anyone who really loves what he does and is a master of his craft - whatever that may be) and Sarah quietly says what we all think: 'you're not a loser'. In the circumstances, her words 'I love you, Eddie' acquire a resonance and depth hardly every acquired by other pathetic speakers of that deathless line. There is the counterpoint with Bert Gordon who is 'dead inside': a hint at one of the sides to the nature of evil. The 'good' ending is not the all-too-often Hollywood syrup, and to call it the triumph of positive values over empty vice would be so simplistic as to be laughable. You do not have to be a pool/billiards/snooker player at all to enjoy this aspect of the film: the focus is not on the table; the seediness of the place and players are part of a social comment which is so light yet so penetrating - the external furniture of the souls of those concerned, especially Eddie's, naturally. One thousand words are not enough to analyse this film (what about Sarah's character and the acting of Piper Laurie, for example?). It is a masterpiece."
