"From the creative mind of INDIA'S best actor, writer/director aamir khan the film brings to light what it is truly like to be dyslexic. AAMIR created this film with one purpose kept firmly in mind: to raise awareness about dyslexia. (great film, it speaks out to anyone with Dyslexic disorders. and is a relatable story to anyone. definitely an award worthy film.Did I mention the script is absolutely brilliant? There are a lot of =truly= funny moments. And the music rocks. But those are only specific aspects of a movie that has just about everything else right about it as well.See it, enjoy it, think about it, see it again. Think about it some more."
"As I just became aware of this film a few weeks ago, and ordered a DVD and watched it today (10-9-11) this review is unlikely to be seen by many because the film is 4 years old and there are nearly 250 user reviews already. So rather than rehash the plot, I will first mention that I have been an Educational Therapist for over 45 years, and have worked extensively with dyslexic and ADD and ADHD children in my practice, so this film had intrinsic interest to me going in. But despite seeing many films on learning problems through the years, some very good, I have never seen any movie that can come close to this one both in emotional power and subject accuracy. When I saw that the film is 165 minutes long, I was expecting to watch it in two sittings, but I never once felt the need to take a break, and in the second half of the film, when the director Aamir Khan enters the story, I was riveted continuously, and embarrassingly shed more than a few tears. If you have any interest in education and the problems the outsiders face, this is a must-see. And if you just want to see an intelligent drama with no car chases, explosions, sex scenes, or ultra violence, then you will be glad you saw this wonderful film, which, by the way, while it is about children, is not really for children, unless they are over about 11 or 12, or have suffered the experience of failing due to undiagnosed or treated reading or similar learning difference. Don't let the Disney Studio name fool you, this does not feel like a typical Disney movie, but the film does point out that Walt Disney himself had school learning problems as a child. Another aspect of the film is something I always try to impart to my clients: There is life after school. And it is not necessary to be the best at everything to be successful. Just become the best you are able and try to find something you like doing that makes you happy.The rest will take care of itself. What a great film!Since I first wrote this review, I have rewatched it 5 more times, and now consider it the best film I have ever seen, and that encompasses about 2500 films."
"First point: Taare Zameen Par is not a movie for children. Its also not a movie only about 'special' children. What it stands for and depicts stunningly is how the cruel world outside is stealing away our children's precious childhood. It is about how our parents are turning into monsters and imposing their own dreams and aspirations on their children which eventually destroys our children's confidence and can only create a generation of hate. Its about how each child needs attention and care and how we so lack those qualities in this life thats bounded by time.Aamir Khan does a fabulous job both behind and in front of the camera. There are scenes in which just his facial expressions tugs at our hearts and moves us. That is truly the hallmark of a great actor. But then, Taare Zameen Par is not about Aamir. Its truly owned by Darsheel Safary. Right from the first scene to the very end he steals the show and our hearts with his endearing acting.Taare Zameen Par is a biting criticism of the times we live in. But it also makes you smile, laugh, cry, nod in agreement and seethe with anger.. everything that a movie is supposed to do. It truly is a movie which everyone can relate to. Reminds you that movies are meant to make us think.. to provoke us and act as a mirror of our times. Taare Zameen Par does all this and much more. Watch it if you like watching meaningful movies.Sreejith - dailyrium.wordpress.com"
"for a mainstream Hindi film, the following is rare: 1. a film for children2. the only star of the film getting a limited screen space 3. high quality animation4. choosing undertones over melodrama, 5. no regular masala stuff 6. strong message that can actually change lives of people 7. conviction and honesty of the makers palpable in every frame 8. and in spite of all this, the movie offering complete, healthy entertainment...the only problem with the audience is that although we keep shouting on the extreme want of quality cinema, meaningful cinema, when a good film actually comes, we tend to find more flaws in it than appreciating it. Are we insecure of accepting somebodies honesty and creative genius?Sure, Taare Zameen Par has moments that could have been better, but shouldn't we just try to overlook those and once, for all, applaud the effort the makers have put...and believe me it is not difficult... for there are innumerable other moments that leave you spellbound, a wet film over your eyes, a strange pain down your throat, a mild ache at your heart, but a pure smile on your lips... there are times you wish you were a kid... may be it takes a child to love simple tales told with honesty and warmth... may be we grown ups have lost that quality we all once had... but Taare Zameen Par should touch a chord somewhere in every one's heart... we all have been after all, at least for some beautiful part of our lives, special. the film is dedicated to that special child in all of us...P.S- no one can hate it...at least i would like to think that way"
"Although Bollywood releases 100s of movies every year but few of them has really left a mark on the audience for a long time. I am pretty much sure that this movie has done an excellent job for all those people who are creative but not good in academics. Many people think things differently but in India like country where competition begins at the age of 4 they are just a dumb in the society. Amir khan has done a very good job on both sides on the screen and off the screen besides he doesn't appear too often on the screen but Darsheel Safary steals the whole movie show.What a nice performance by a 8-9 year old child you are really gonna love this child. The movie brings our sweet childhood memories back.Its a mix of emotion, laugh and cry. We can imagine how we exploit children because they are not like us or they are not able to do what their parents want them to do.At the start, movie shows that how a little child(Darsheel Safary) is forced to do what he can't understand. He gets lowest marks in the class and he has failed once in class three.Sometimes he bunk the class and most of the time he has been out of the class because he don't understand how to turn a page number of the book or while reading letters dance so he can't read. After fear of being thrown him out of the school his parents put him in a boarding school.They think he is lazy and notorious.But in boarding school situation gets worse until a drawing teacher(Amir khan) gets an appointment as a temporary teacher. After that Amir teaches him in different way and ultimately he gets the success.In this movie director has taken two child one who always gets first and who is punctual for his work and other one is Darsheel Safary who is not good in academics because he can't understand letters and can't memorize too much things at a time. This movie is a motivation for all kind of child and their parents. Everyone should must watch this movie at least once. If you are too emotional then u may cry with Amir khan."
"How many times has there been a movie you could really relate to? How many times has it happened that you've seen a character on the screen that reminds of something that you've been through in your life? As I saw Ishan (Darsheel Safary) today, I felt, somewhere deep within that that's me.Notwithstanding the slight retard nature, dyslexia and bad academic performance, the character of Ishan really made me remember my childhood today. I remember I was something like him as a child.creative and imaginative. And my imagination always went unappreciated. I used to curate gibberish  just like he did. I painted, I dreamed and I fantasized about different things. So I feel writer Amol Gupte and director Aamir Khan (what a wonderful debut!) have picked an incredibly moving story. Frankly, I am not easily moved by movies. Not even the greatest tearjerkers have managed to ""move"" me, but for a moment I was stunned. Is this really happening to me? Am I trying to cry? In fact, the scene where Ram (Aamir Khan) walks into Ishan's room and discovers a score of sketches and drawings, it made me feel like somebody had in fact, opened my closet and discovered my secret childhood fantasies (Believe me, I still have them.) This movie will surely engage all those who have had similar incidents in their lives. That's for sure. I am moved. I love this film. I don't know and I don't care how this film does in the box office but let me tell you don't watch this film if you're looking for regular boy meets girl story. Don't even skip this film thinking it's children's movie  no it isn't. In fact, Taare Zameen Par is a movie potentially targeted towards parents. But if you think you too have undergone similar childhood conflicts and lived a life where the people around you refuse to appreciate your fantasies, then definitely go for it. TZP mirrors many of those people's lives that looks just plain and simple but those who compromised their dreams for the sake of the earthly existence.Okay, enough of fantasies. Technically, writer Amol Gupte delivers an A Grade script. Aamir Khan shows his talent not just as an actor but a very versatile and intelligent. Oscar Wilde, Leonardo da Vinci and Sally Gardner were hardly ever heard of in Hindi cinema before this. The writer just does not deliver a well written script but also his knowledge of research (which other filmmakers hardly ever do!) Musically, it's two-thumbs up for Shanker Ehsaan Loy. The title song is fascinating. Maa and Jame Raho combine talents in all respects- music, words and voice. The production design is superb. Not for a moment you feel anything is fake. They even managed to squeeze in some quick visual effects and animated scenes. They're there to add another dimension to great story telling. The casting is good and well justified. Little Darsheel steals the show. Tisca Chopra grabs attention.Aamir Khan, however stuns the audience by appearing at almost near half of the film. That's the surprise but you don't miss Aamir in the first half because Darsheel will definitely grab your attention and Aamir gets to show some good directorial talent.All in all, I'd say go and watch the film. I wouldn't recommend if you're addicted to Yashraj stuffs but if you really want to see some intelligent film-making, then Taare Zameen Par is a treat."
"If you haven't seen Taare Zameen Par, you are missing out. The best Hindi movie of 2007 without doubt. Extremely sensitively handled, and flawlessly executed performances, especially by Darsheel Safary. This movie really hits you.In a way, everyone can relate to it, especially if you have grown up in India where most children are classified as dumb or unintelligent if they ""can't"" become engineers or doctors. I went in with huge expectations, and this movie exceeded them.Some reviews have complained about situations in the movie being too simple or repetitive in parts, but I have absolutely no problems with that. This is no thriller. You know what's going to happen, but you are looking forward to it too.The songs might not be great hits, but they gel really well with the movie. They are beautifully worded, and capture the emotions of the characters perfectly.When the end credits started rolling, most people started walking towards the exit, but even when they had almost stopped rolling, most of them were still standing near the exit, watching the images in the end credits."
"The ghost (director) has been resurrected in human flesh and yes, Mr Perfectionist has got it all perfect. His maiden directorial venture is a delight for one and all. Whether you are a kid, or a teenager, just married, or if you are a parent -- Yes... You'll love it! Pre-release in what appeared to be a non mainstream film, shines like a UNIVERSAL film which will keep the box office abuzz.The story moves along at a very natural pace at which the viewer is able to connect to the 8 year old dyslexic boy played by Darsheel Safary. That is the biggest plus point of the movie, the viewer draws parallel with the boys character connecting with him at a very high emotional level. You'll reminisce and be transported back to those wonderful years of your childhood and will have more than a tear in the eye. The scene where the boy is admitted in the boarding school and bidding goodbye to his parents and brother followed by the 'Maa' song is a real tear jerker. But tears is not all what you are going to have, the screenplay makes sure that those tear jerking moments are followed by heavy doses of laughter with some lovely and innocent humorous moments.If you thought that only Sanjay Leela Bhansali knew how to capture art on celluloid then watch TZP. The boy's bunked day at school, his room, classroom decor, and the painting competition in the end are a colorful visual delight expressing a million words to the viewers.Yes, its true. Aamir's character appears just before the end of the first half, but one is so engrossed that Aamir - The actor's absence is not felt. Thats remarkable! All the credit goes to the protagonist played by Darsheel who in my books gives the best performance till date by a child artist in Hindi Cinema. He is the heart and soul of the movie and how naturally this boy handles scenes of intense emotions with such ease in his first movie is stunning. Tisca Chopra as the boy's mother gives a top notch performance at par, if not above the likes of roles played by Nirupa Roy, Rakhi and Kirron Kher.Aamir the actor has a shorter but powerful role which he performs decently. But at the end of the day its Aamir - The Director who wins hands down by extracting 'A GRADE' performances from all the cast, and making a movie which connects to the heart of the viewer. The second half becomes a little slow in between and it could have been more crisp. But thats negligible because in the end the movie manages convincingly to convey a very important message to today's parents - Your kids are not race horses of a derby. Let them travel life at their pace as each has their unique mission which only they can fulfill.Lastly, TZP just made 2007 better and interesting. The award season is knocking and well, watch out, TZP may just pull off a surprise or two by upsetting the favorites so far..."
"A good film on children has always been much needed for Indian film-goers. And when in this moment of dearth one gets treated to a movie that simply touches the soul - needless to say - Taare Zameen Par - does just that.Aamir Khan proves his mettle as a director. As an actor he is fabulous. The story captures a look at a middle class family who feel the younger kid (Darsheel Safary) is not a patch on the elder one who is a topper at class. The younger one is always struggling with his ABCs and spends more time out of his class rather than inside.Its only when he is sent to boarding school with the hope that an iron fist will help him improve that he comes across art teacher (Aamir Khan) who correctly identities his problem of suffering from dyslexia and decides to unleash his creativity and make him an achiever.To know more one should watch this movie since it has elements that everyone could relate towards while at school or boarding, and brings into focus the need for underprivileged and slow learning children to be given the chance to prove themselves with patience and love that would help them merge with mainstream education and become worthwhile contributors.Brilliant job Aamir and your team for treating the subject with respect, honesty and flair. Darsheel Safary as the struggling kid has done total justice to his role and puts in a performance that will always be remembered.The movie will make you cry, make you laugh, make you rejoice and come out feeling that there are some people out there who take Indian cinema several notches higher."

"""Taare Zameen Par"" is an exceptional story, but it is only and exceptional film because of its director (Aamir). Aamir does an amazing job of engaging his audience, introducing a brilliant main character (Ishan), and making the audience experience the reality of children's paradise & their inner world. The story to which very people could relate; however, the directorial & cinematography mastery exhibits throughout allows the audience to accompany Ishan on his journey and awareness of his weakness. Anyone who has been close to the frailties of the human mind will appreciate how respectfully and honestly this film approaches the subject. Aamir is able to portray all the complex reactions to mental dimension's while maintaining the humanity and essence of the subject. Superbly directed, wonderfully acted by Tanay Chheda (ishaan) and cast, this film succeeds on every level."
"An excellent direction, beautiful narration and an emotional ending. This movie deserves the best of applause. The director has done an out of the world job. At no point in the movie does he overshadow the kid. The best thing I love about the movie is the facial expressions of Kid. This kid is a genius and has filled life into the role of a dyslexic. Movie is so perfect, doting mom, lovable brother and a strict dad. The manifestation of problems has been toned beautifully and the way the kid is helped to get out the problems is artistic. I hope I could vote more than 10 for this masterpiece. Missing this movie would be a blunder."

"I sat down in my local theatre with no expectations at all, and what I was in for, for the coming couple of hours, was just mind boggling. Taare Zameen Par might not win any awards, might not get the praise it so surely deserves, but don't let that fool you. For this movie is not just a story about Ishaan, but a masterpiece ! Ishaan is a 8 year old boy who suffers from dyslexia, no matter how hard he tries he just doesn't succeed in day to day activities. But what is mostly the case in our hard society is that people don't understand him and his shortcomings. Most of the times they paint him off as a lazy-no good-brat and this drives his father so far that he will have no more of this nonsense and sends young Ishaan off to boarding school, where he gets treatened even worse. But one day arrives Mr Ramshankar Nikumbh, a temporary art-teacher and the only person in the world that understands Ishaan's problem. Taare Zameen Par moves on as Mr Nikumbh tries to understand and help out Ishaan with his problem. This starts a journey far greater and more beautiful we could ever imagine.I have seen a thousand movies and I must say that I haven't seen a script acted out so well for quite a while now. For non-movie buffs let me explain good acting, there are a few ways to tell brilliant acting from good acting . Just look for the quality, view every character as the character itself and not as the actor behind it acting the part out. If you don't see the actor, only the character that means you are convinced of the quality of acting. A view examples, Marlon Brando played The godfather so convincingly that for years to come people didn't see Brando but Vito Corleone same goes for Pacino when he played Scarface and so forth. Taare Zameen Par is a work of great acting by everyone, it feels so real and the characters grow on to you as the movie continues. And this is very strange for a Bollywood movie. Let's be real this is the film industry who had us believing that Hritik was a jewel thief and that Abishek was a police officer, how entertaining it might be, but it just doesn't feel real. For a character to feel real, like they do in Taare Zameen Par, there is need for a great written script and clever dialogue. The actors just do what they are supposed to and the movie plays out nicely. Then there's only the editing, the background score, the location, ... to worry about. And if everything is according to a pallet, compare it to a painting, where every element blends in with the other we get a great movie. And only once in a while we witness a masterpiece and that's exactly what TZP is, and this time it's not because of Mr Khan but because of his apprentice Darsheel Safary. The young boy who played Ishaan (Darsheel Safary) is one of the best child- artists I've seen coming out of Bollywood and what a first starrer this kid got. I surely would like to see more of him in the near future. And for Aamir Khan's first movie TZP wouldn't have been the same without Safary. Although some credit goes to Mr Khan himself as well. Known to be a perfectionist, his directional debut is a clear-cut proof of this. TZP is not just a movie about kids, it's a movie about life, society and yourself as a personality. The story moves you, into nostalgic days of your childhood when you were forced and pressured by your parents or teachers, into the world of a child who is ill-treated an misunderstood, into the hard truths of our society were failure is looked down on. If there ever was a movie who could make you smile, cry and enjoy the trip it's Taare Zameen Par. A great watch for everyone. This doesn't feel like a movie coming from Bollywood, but a movie for the masses. I surely hope this does well."
"I was impressed with this movie. Even more than with the Kite Runner. Mainly because it is one of the most sensitive and realistic Hindi movies that I have ever seen in my life. The first thing my sister said when we were out of the theater was ""I want that kid's autograph."" Darsheel Safary did a brilliant job as the dyslexic but cute Ishaan. I recommend that ALL parents watch this movie WITH their kids. This movie shows the effects of parental pressure, social isolation, andinspiration, of course. Aamir Khan was very provoking as the caring art teacher, Nikumbh, that recognizes young Ishaan's mental withdrawal yet his amazing ability to paint and build. It is one thing to imagine such bizarre things, but to put it on paper or construct things in an appealing way is definitely a gift. I thought that no part of the movie was melodramatic or overly done which is a major concern in Indian movies. Instead, I thought that there was a lot of promise in this movie just like how there is a promise in every child that has the motivation and faith to achieve something. And the title translated as ""Little Stars on Earth"" describes all children that are looking for this promise although they may not have everything that most children have. Wowwhat an effect this movie had on me"
"I'm not always a fan of the Bollywood style of filmmaking: overrun with musical montages and exaggerated dialogue and acting. But 'Like Stars on Earth' is a magical film about the magnificent abilities that children have, even when all the odds are against them. With a story as powerful as this one, it doesn't matter where or how the story is told.Luckily, most of the Bollywood clichés actually enhance the film experience. Being such an integral part of the story, the soundtrack and score complement the film wonderfully. Each song aligning nicely with the film's dramatic but hopeful tone. Admittedly, having a rap song play over Ishaan's family getting dressed and ready for the day is a bit jarring, but the songs that play after Aamir Khan appear are nothing short of enchanting.This film is about a dyslexic child who has basically given up on school as no one seems to think he's worth anything. His father beats him for goofing off and all of his teachers scold him for not being able to do the simplest of tasks. So, Ishaan finds his way to a boarding school where he meets Ram Shankar Nikumbh (Aamir Khan) who may change his life forever. Everybody had that teacher who changed the way you approached school and perhaps even life itself, which is why I thought this movie was so effective. There's nothing more gratifying than watching someone struggling to find their way, only to have one uniquely suited person put them back on track. It seems so simple but coming from a teaching background, I'll be the first person to say that it can be nearly impossible to connect with someone who doesn't want any help. However, when and if that connection is made, it's possibly the most fulfilling thing a person can do. Aamir Khan captures these emotions perfectly near the end of Like Stars on Earth. I don't think I'll ever get the image of Ishaan's father breaking down into tears out of my head. There's some really powerful stuff here.8.6/10"
"Though the film is about children,it shouldn't be confused as a film for children.The film excelled with fine performances from Darsheel Safary and Aamir Khan.The first part of the film dealt mainly with the problems faced by the protagonist Ishaan.He is a bundle of creativity,but is not able to fare well academically being dyslexic.His father,tired of the numerous complaints from teachers and other parents sends him to the boarding school to get disciplined.There he gets even more lonely and dejected,being away from his family.Aamir Khan steps in as the new art teacher,Ram Shankar Nikhumb.He encourages the children to think differently and act on their true potential.He soon realizes the reason why Ishaan is so unhappy.The rest of the film is about Ishaan realizing his true potential.The film is a must see for this Christmas!!So what are u waiting for..."
"""Every child is an artist."" -- Picasso""The child must know that he is a miracle, that since the beginning of the world there hasn't been, and until the end of the world there will not be, another child like him."" -- Pablo CasalsIt's a little while after intermission in the movie Taare Zameen Par. By this time we (the audience) have already seen that Ishaan Awasthi (Darsheel Safary) is a kid who's been failing his classes at day school and is mocked as an idiot by both teachers and classmates. He has now been packed and sent to a boarding school. His parents hope this will improve his grades. In the new environment, Ishaan finds it all the more harder to understand concepts that are easy for his peers. The teachers who rap on his knuckles and the rules at the school have broken into him. He has lost the zest of a kid, he's become a zombie, deaf to the world.It's the Arts class, being taught by the temporary Arts teacher Ram Nikumbh (Aamir Khan). In the quest to understand what's been eating Ishaan, he has examined his notebooks, talked to his parents and discovered that the silent pupil in his class might be dyslexic. In this class, he starts to tell a story to the students. ""Once upon a time, there was a kid. He had trouble understanding numbers and alphabets. He couldn't read, write and study like his classmates."" He pauses, then asks ""Do you know whom I'm talking about?"" The camera now slips down to the level of the class desks and zeroes in onto the face of Ishaan. His mouth is agape, his sad eyes are looking down, and as the silent tension in the class rises, tears form, ready to roll down his face. His name will be mentioned and the students at this school too will mock him now.Ram answers his own question, ""that kid was the great scientist Albert Einstein."" Ishaan looks up and is surprised, he looks relieved that his own name wasn't brought up. Ram smiles at him and continues to tell the class how Einstein, Picasso, Leonardo da Vinci and even Abhishek Bachchan had trouble with reading and writing in their youth. As we learn later, Ishaan and Einstein are not the only two possible answers to Ram's question. Ram himself is a third.That's just one of the scenes from this movie about a dyslexic kid and a teacher who discovers and helps him. It is the first directorial attempt by Aamir Khan. AK is the only Bollywood hero I admire and I saw the movie today on its release weekend. And loved it! It's a bit long, it might be AK's baby, but he should've edited it a bit. Other that that, I was positively moved by it. There were many scenes that were absolutely golden, some even brought a tear to my eye. Watch out for the one where Ishaan floats his propeller boat (made of sticks, pencils, corks and rubber-bands) in the school pond and it slowly makes its way towards Ram. That scene is both moving and metaphorical. There are many more like that.How do you even attempt to show the audience how the world looks to a kid, a dyslexic one? Using beautiful cinematography, attention to detail (observe how the camera is usually at the kid's height, not adult height) and sometimes story-telling animation (remember Calvin and his space adventures?) we get to see how Ishaan relishes the simple sights and sounds of the real world, while at the same time is being hounded by the terrors of his textbooks. This is the finest attempt I've ever seen in a movie (Hollywood or Bollywood) to show how a kid sees the adult world. Brilliant scripting and story-telling, AK the director rules!The background music is top notch, the title track and its music is superb, but the other songs are just OK. AK doesn't even enter the movie until the intermission and even after that he is just a secondary character. Darsheel Safary owns this movie!!! It's his show all the way from the start to the end. Acting that is so brilliant that you can't call it acting. Ishaan has a strict (but caring) father, a loving mother and a helpful elder brother, all of whom are characterized very realistically. I'm willing to bet that you will laugh in some scenes and cry in some of the moving scenes, especially with his mom and him.I found the movie to be both inspiring and introspective. Dyslexia actually occupies a very small piece of the movie and its message -- that each kid is unique and his/her creative imagination needs to be handled with care by parents, teachers and society. A highly recommended watch."
"If all start living on their own terms, this world will be altogether a different place. Childhood is that juvenile period in life when the dreams have no boundaries and sky is the limit. It's only when the weight of someone else's dream comes on your shoulder; life turns full circle and you start as if there was no past. Resisting sticking with past raises questions to your capabilities as in this world there is only one way to get praised which is to perform the best in all the fields.This is not just a movie but this is a world from a child's view. Here 3*9 can be 3 and yes it's logical since Pluto (The 9th planet) has no more existence. Ishaan is an eight year old boy who is little different from others. Lost in his own world, always short of words but yet understands every single aspect of life. Problem with him is to express himself loudly, no one understands the way he behaves since he himself is puzzled the way things are going around him. Unclear in expressing himself, he presses his parents and teachers to start thinking that he is not one of the normal child but someone who requires special attention. This forces his demanding father to sent him to a boarding school, an eight year old boy who always lived his life in shadow of his mother couldn't adjust to this abrupt distance from her and goes into mental trauma which makes him a speechless kid, Berated by the teachers and friends around, this new world takes every color from his life until his new art teacher Ram comes in and helps him to get outside the nutshell to prove that Ishaan is no less than a brilliant artist in making.It's a lesson for all those parents who expect their child to win all the races; one has to accept that you can't have no# 1 in every house, someone has to be in lower down the order. Actual problem starts when parents start pushing their child to fulfill their own dreams which they saw but couldn't convert into realities. It's not always about being in the race and finishing first, sometimes finishing it gracefully also matters. In a way, everyone can relate to it, especially if you have grown up in India where most children are classified as dumb or unintelligent if they ""can't"" become engineers or doctors. Movie is a biting criticism of the times we live in. But it also makes you smile, laugh, cry, nod in agreement and seethe with anger; everything that a movie is supposed to do. It truly is a movie which everyone can relate to. Reminds you that movies are meant to make us think; to provoke us and act as a mirror of our times. Taare Zameen Par does all this and much more. This is outstanding heart-warming stuff, hats off to Aamir for once again taking on an off- beat topic and bringing it to life in his directorial debut. This movie surely belongs to children and their childhood.I myself have worked with kids who require help like Ishaan and I know it very well how do they feel when the world is too demanding and there is less power in you to fulfill them. I am happy that I saw this movie well in advance, now surely I am going to do justice to the new age coming. I rated this movie as PRG and surely it's a must watch for each parent and future parents."
"(I notice that there are many spoilers here already,therefore I wont go much into the plot detail)There seems to be an implied understanding that Aamir Khan represents the last word on intellectual mainstream cinema.It was many years back when he decided to curtail the number of projects he takes up in an year which was considered suicidal then but now is the norm for most of the top stars.For last 14 years this man has pushed the envelope for mainstream by taking some unprecedented risks with young directors and pulling it off time and time again.For some of us who have followed his career choices,there was a feeling that he would make a great director.His choices of films are a testimony to his understanding of the medium and the audience within the mainstream perspective.""Taare Zameen Par"" is his first directorial venture,less by design and more by circumstances.Based on the brilliant script by Amol Gupte who is one of the innovative painters and theater personalities,the story dwells into the life of boy struggling to find himself in this ruthless world.Briefly,the boy ""Ishan"" who suffers from dyslexia comes from a middle class Indian family who is unable to read/learn or identify letters.Constantly bombarded with unrelenting taunts for his poor academics and being labeled as a ""duffer"",he is isolated into his world of colors which is the only place he can seek solace in.But Ishan reaches a new low when he is packed off to boarding school by his father.The hard regimen and discipline of the school frustrates the boy out of his wits and he is finding drastic ways to put an end to his misery.He no longer feels th need to communicate .Just when things seem irrevocable,comes the art teacher,Aamir Khan,who being a dyslexic himself and working with the ""less privileged"" children identifies Ishan's troubles and can read through his silence,is sanitized by the apathy towards him.Then starts the process of resurrecting the boy's dying self belief and charting out a way for him to read and learn.The boy starts to slowly but surely come out of his shell and become a ""child"" again.One of the many aspects of a perfect film is that nothing seems to stand out,every aspect whether it be the performances,the camera work,the sound mixing,the lighting,the editing etc everything seems in sync.Same can be said about this movie.But the thing that I found overwhelming as a viewer is the music by ""Shankar""-Ehsaan-Loy"" and the lyrics by ""Prasoon Joshi"".Watch out for ""taare zameen par"",""Meri Maa"",these will definitely break you down.The cinematography by Setu is flawless and Aamir does not fall into the trap of being slick or showing off in his debut effort.(Watch how the camera is usually at Ishan's height to show his perspective,watch how slowly the camera pans into Ishan's space and how still and focused it is on his face when he is about to bare his emotions) The performances are top draw.Darsheel who plays Ishan is the crux of the film.Being the main protagonist his performance was critical to the film.I dare say,we have found a new star.The boy is brilliant in his joy,in his enthusiasm,in his loneliness as he allows us to enter his world.I feel he represents children all over the world and more critically the ""child"" within all of us.Of the support cast Tisca Chopra and Aamir Khan are brilliant as his mother and teacher respectively.Because the movie revolves around a middle class family in suburban Mumbai,I guess these characters and their emotions are something I can relate to.Finally(on the movie),kudos to Amol Gupte and Aamir Khan.Let us not forget this was Amol's baby and he had worked with children and done research for 7 years.What he came with was a near perfect script and it is only fair that he was credited as a creative director.What can I say about Aamir Khan that hasn't been said before?I think with every movie he is setting new yardsticks for Indian cinema.His movies clearly have elaborated that our movies can have all the commercial trappings yet need not be ""dumbed down"".They can be as intellectually stimulating.All I can say is that it is privilege to be in an era where this champion actor is at the absolute peak of his powers.With this movie he goes into the elite list of actors who happen to be great story tellers.But is this movie about dyslexia?Is this movie about the failure of our education system in not nurturing the individual talent but creating assembly line products?Are we as a society so obsessed with the ""idea"" of security through academics that creativity is of no accord to us?Are we preparing our children for a rat race or we preparing them for life?Are parents right in imposing their ambitions on the life they bring to this earth ?Some question that I have asked of myself before and some that I ask now.I guess the main motive of the film is as the tag line says ""every child is special"" for the talent he has.Our job is to nurture it,not mold it.p.s. I have been a frequent movie goer for last 7-8 years.But haven't seen a response like I did for this one.Everyone in the theater was in tears and simultaneous applause and is not because it was a sad film but it was ""overwhelming"".I guess there some part of Ishan in all of our lives.The second aspect that I have never witnessed in theaters before was that nobody moved till the credits were over.There is documentary on children at the end(do not miss it for anything,it is as moving as the film)."
"Well no words can describe this awesome movie, had a chance to watch it a couple of days back but the feeling is yet to sink in. Aamir scores and how, when his colleagues in the industry are dishing out nothing but junk. This man has dared to be different, how else could one describe the first half of the film where a kid is the only spotlight. A kid who was an unknown identity until the promos lashed on the TV screens. Yes the kid has delivered big time and holds the viewers attention through the first half with aplomb.There are many scenes which stay through, the first scene where Ishaan is fishing in the gutter, the scene where Ishaan is punished by the teacher and he makes some animal noises and licks the frame in the corridor, then the scene where he finds out that his dad was just joking about leaving the home, then the diwali scene ... just too good these are the few scenes, others have seem to missed.Stop reading reviews, Go watch it man. Such films only come once in a blue moon."
"Now this one has to be The best Hindi movie of the year , most authentic and daring child movie u can think of. It relates with parents and to be parents and everyone else at the same time. Please don't miss it, Aamir as director has arrived! Its his sensitivity which takes u right into the mind of the child and suddenly when the film unfolds, u r thinking as a child. Aamir come later just before the interval but has a very major part to play. The child actor darsheel had arguably given performance of the year even beating best of the best performances.Whole team of this movie deserves special standing ovation 1st to choose such topic and then to put it on screen in such sensitive way that u bound to melt!"
"Anyone who has rated Tare Zameen Par lower than 8 out of 10 (especially those who have given it a 1 out of 10 rating) either has not seen the movie or has a heart of stone because this was an absolute beautiful and heart touching film about a relationship between a teacher and a student. I felt really sorry for the boy Eshaan and his main problem was that he has a learning disability and is always lost in his fantasy world. The film gave a terrific insight to his fantasy world by showing spinning objects around his head and by an animated sequence. The best scene was the first appearance of Aamir Khan. I have always liked Aamir Khan's films and I would put Tare Zameen Par number 2 on his top 5 best movies & number 1 would be Lagaan. The story was very uplifting, which shows that even the worst student can become the best. It was already on the IMDb top 250 when it came out and was on about 180 place but sadly not anymore and I'm disappointed. There is a huge list of crappy films that are on the top 250 but not a single Bollywood movie and this gem is original."
"Taare Zameen Par is a film about childhood, about dreams, about love, about innocence, about the joy of little things. It is about the simple things in life, things that are most beautiful, yet most often missed by the eye. This is a film that will make you cry, make you laugh, entertain you, and make you love every moment of it.Amol Gupte has written a brilliant story, and the director, Aamir Khan, has only matched up to it. I am sure the film will appeal to the mass audience, yet ever individual who watches it will identify with it very personally. That is the magic of cinema, and because in this film the entire process, beginning from the concept, to the post-production, has been so honest, it has happened flawlessly. It is about an 8 year old dyslexic boy, Ishaan Awasthi, enacted by Darsheel Safary, who lives in a world of his own. He is not good with academics, but excellent at painting. His family cannot understand or accept his problem, and they try to set things right with the use of force. The boy is sent to a boarding school, which only distances him further from his family, and he grows more and more into himself. He withdraws himself from people, from painting, even from his little pleasures and simple things that once brought him joy. And then, a new temporary art teacher, Ram Shankar Nikumbh is inducted, and everything starts to change.We all live in our shells. We live in denial, till the time a problem hits us directly. We need to open our eyes. It is not just about dyslexia, but a lot more. I think the film shows people what they refuse to see, and while it entertains, it subconsciously makes them accept. I honestly feel, India really needed a film like this.The narrative, the way the story unfolds, is excellent. The pace is just right, it moves along with the boy, and takes you with it. It is a visual treat, with the attention to detail and slick editing in Jame Raho to Tarkovsky's Stalker like shots of the drain. Darsheel has given an excellent performance, and Aamir Khan has definitely done a great job of his directorial debut. Shankar, Ehsaan, Loy's music and Prasoon Joshi's lyrics fit the film, and the world of childhood, just perfectly. The film is sure to touch the lives of anybody and everybody who watches it. And I definitely recommend it to everyone, it is a must watch!"
"Being Aamir's directorial debut, one was sure of a didactic film. Somehow, Aamir never sets out to just tell a story or make a movie; the social message is never far away. He would almost be a Shyam Benegal if not for the dollops of humor he manages to sprinkle in his movies. The archaic belief that humor stains the ""purity"" of a serious message is the biggest mistake made, I feel, by ""art movie"" makers. A brilliant work like ""Khoya Khoya Chand (2007)"" was ruined by its droning pace and monotonic atmosphere. You look forward to Aamir's cinema because he uses humor, songs-- even pretty heroines-- to make sure his serious cinema is taken seriously!The movie is straightforward. Tells the story of a misunderstood dyslexic kid who leads a tortured life till new Teacher Aamir uncle comes and makes everything OK. Everyone is sorry they treated him bad. Happy ending! Blah Blah. Hardly a spoiler, I'd say, but you'd been warned.What I was not ready for was the dollops of tears that forced their way out of my eyes. I am a ""Kill Bill"" type of viewer and any movie with less than 100 explosions and 35 gallons of blood is usually not worth my while. Imagine my surprise when TZP easily squeezed those emotions I never knew I had. So much for ""predictability""!What makes it stick with you is the uncanny acting of the kid. I must commend Aamir's direction, in the absence of any other reason, to get so many kids to act so naturally. Move over, Mr.India! The repressed anger, the fear, the small joys and the yearning to belong. Ishaan displays everything so effortlessly it would put many matinée idols to shame. He manages all this without being corny or melodramatic. Then there is Setu's photography that captures the tiny details we all remember having watched as kids. Then forgotten in the rush to to attend the next con-call. Like the ripples made in a puddle after a car runs over, the aggressive spray of shower in the bathroom, the miracle of watching ""ice gola"" being made at Juhu beach...Finally there is Prasoon Joshi. The only reason one would watch this (like, RDB) many times over-- in theatres! Simple, non-complicated (Gulzarji, you listening?) and pedestrian lyrics. Stuff you can identify with, stuff that makes so much sense and yet sounds so poetic! Funny and sad at the same time. Added to Shankar Ehsaan Loy's music and Ram Madhvani's (of ""Let's Talk"" fame) cameo direction, each song tells a story.The innovative start credits and lovely collage during end-credits are not to be missed. The movie got a standing ovation at the Bangalore theatre we visited, from a predominantly college crowd at that.I hope it sensitizes Indian schools and society to treat all children as mere ""children"". We have to let them enjoy the colors and miracle of nature that adult life requires us to ignore. I loved this movie not so much for its message on dyslexia (although it makes a powerful statement) as for how it reminded me that I was a kid once. It reminded me how I wished those damn adults would just ""understand""! I remembered how I'd decided to ""remember"" my childhood and not change into an ""adult"". Now that I have a kid of my own, TZP is just what I needed to make sure I treat my little star with the respect he deserves and not as a ""race horse""."
"Taare Zameen Par  Words fell short as I start writing about this impressive emotional movie from ""Aamir Khan"" & his team. Unarguably the film deserves a standing ovation for its unusual content and for its near perfect execution. The impact I felt after viewing it was quite similar to what I felt after watching movies of great film makers like Bimol Roy and Guru Dutt. Aamir Khan delivers what was expected from him, an out of the routine, emotional, memorable and enlightening film which is capable of bringing changes in the lives of many families. The film revolves around a boy who is facing difficulties in studies and his teacher who comes in his life as a morning breeze. The film emphasizes completely on the character of the child, his thoughts and it's a journey into the imaginative world of his mind. The visual interpretation of what he is thinking is innovatively shot and is a visual treat to watch . Aamir Khan is a thinking brain with a heart of gold and that he has proved with his directorial venture. He has the guts of following his heart and coming out with an unconventional film like this. Another merit of the film is that it is not preachy, it teaches along with providing the required entertainment to the viewers. The film talks about a condition of a child who is finding tough to compete with his classmates but it never talks about it as a disease or a mental disorder to cure. Aamir focuses on the fact that we got to give proper attention to all kids as everyone has his own areas of abilities. He also pin points on to the parents who always want their children to score in their studies and just ignore the other aspects of life relating to art and culture. Darsheel Safary, the eight year old child has given a stunning performance. He is not acting, he is emoting his character and has done his part so well that he even overshadows the subtle and cool performance of Aamir. Another actor to watch out is Tisca Chopra as the mother of the child. She is just perfect and makes you remember the motherly touch in your childhood days. The scenes of Aamir with the father of the child are the most effective in the movie. The lyrics of Prasoon Joshi are above than the music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy. They both are more impressive while watching the movie. In short, it's the movie which should be watched as a compulsion by all parents along with their children (would be parents too) and also by all the teachers who should feel the responsibility they have towards each & every child they teach. Concluding my review I would like to request my Indian film lovers that this is a movie which is meant to be watched without munching the popcorn and rightfully deserves a respectful viewing. Hats off to Aamir Khan & Thanks for giving us ""Taare Zameen Par"". The movie is simply above the star rating system"
"this movie is one of the best movie produced by Hindi Cinema. And i wish this one gets nominated for Oscar and wins the same. Best part about this movie is that somewhere in your life, you have faced each and every character of this movie. You can relate yourself to a child who has gone through sweet and bitter time of school age. Or you can relate yourself to parents who is trying their best to keep their children to get prepared for competitive world. This movie can remind you of all strict, result oriented school teachers whose punishments you can never forget. Personally i liked two best scenes in the movie: 1. When aamir khan finds out about the troubled boy at his parents home and trying to convince them to help this child. 2. When Aamir tells the story of Solemon island where people curse the trees to let them die. i recommend each and every individual to watch this movie at least once in their lifetime."
"wow, Cinema at its best Thank you Aamir khan for making this movie...Brilliant work from all actors specially the kid.Hats off Aamir khan production !I seriously could not believe we could make movies like this i hope people at the Board whoever sends movie for Oscars send this one ...at least this one has a slight chance .Taare Zaameen par will sweep all awards there is this year.Best movie i think in last 5-6 years and till Aamir khan production makes another one.11 out of 10 !"
"Everyone knows Aamir Khan the actor - now they have seen Aamir Khan the director - a sensitive and artistic director with a fine eye for detail. A maker of true quality cinema; a director who extracts the best from every actor, every department, every person contributing to his movie.Ishaan Awasthi (Darsheel Safary), is a young boy of eight who admires and adores the simple things in life, such as Nature, colours, animals and toys. The 'real' world - as his parents tell him - which consists of grades, neatness, and homework, is just too tiring and boring for Ishaan to deal with and he spends his time daydreaming and having fun. Unlike his older brother Yohaan, who has earned an admirable reputation for his top marks and studious attitude, Ishaan cannot seem to focus, however hard he tries, and reading and writing are torture on his mind. Ishaan starts a reputation of his own, one of mischief and bad behaviour, and is ultimately packed off to boarding school, to be ""disciplined"". Torn away from his family, and isolated in a world of bright, prim-proper children, Ishaan is lost in a new world, of misery and and tears. His impressive talent for painting and drawing is barely recognized - he cannot fit in academically and this is causing him to succumb to stress and fear, not to mention killing his self esteem completely. One day a new art teacher joins his school, Ram Shankar Nikumbh (Aamir Khan), who encourages the children to think bright an bold; fill their minds with imagination; dance, sing, express themselves. As the other kids grow to love Nikumbh, Ishaan barely acknowledges his new teacher, and remains in his daze of homesickness and gloom. Nikumbh sees past Ishaan, and views the pain in his eyes, and using his kind, patient nature, he discovers that Ishaan suffers from Dyslexia - a learning disorder which is the cause of his low marks. Nikumbh holds out a helping hand to Ishaan, and becomes the one person to look past the grades and see the boy inside, resulting in a close and caring friendship, and exulting Ishaan into the clouds once more - but this time to find his foothold.Taare Zameen Par is Aamir Khan's directorial debut, as well as his debut as a producer. One very impressive thing about his direction is the pace of the movie, which progresses naturally until the very end. The cinematography and production design were superb, as was the music. The added animation, which surprised me, was better than anything I expected for a Bollywood movie; much crisper and sharper, transporting the viewer to the world of Ishaan's dreams. The A-Grade script by Amol Gupte also contributes greatly, and I did not find the ending to be ""cheesy"" or too dramatic in the slightest.The fine performance by Darsheel Safary stands out, and the little one is sure to be remembered for his fantastic portrayal of Ishaan Awasthi. Though I found he didn't speak much throughout the movie, he brought a life to his role and endeared himself to the audience. His performance brought a lump to my throat on more than one occasion, and reminded me of certain parts of my childhood. Whenever anyone says 'CHILD STAR', I will think of him. Aamir surprised me once more by letting the little one carry the movie forward, and only appearing just about halfway. Even then, Aamir did not steal the film, though he did give a powerful performance, and the spotlight was kept on Darsheel. The two actors playing Ishaan's parents, Tisca Chopra and Vipin Sharma, were adequate, though I was more impressed with Chopra than her male counterpart. The chemistry between the cast seemed good, though I thought Darsheel and Aamir's on screen connection could have seemed stronger.The soundtrack amazed me. My favourite song, had to be 'Maa'. The amount tears I shed during that one song is hard to explain. The beautiful lyrics added to the charm of the song, and even hearing it now makes me want to cry my heart out. 'Bum Bum Bole' is a lighthearted and catchy track picturised on Aamir, and 'Jame Raho' is an addictive number which was used and picturised very well. 'Kholo Kholo' is a soulful song with again, gorgeous lyrics, leaving 'Bheja Kum', an interesting track, used to show Ishaan's trouble at Boarding School. The title track was also lovely.I really regret not having seen this when it released. After viewing it, I strongly believe this is the best movie that came out in 2007, every film seems weak before Taare Zameen Par, it overshadows almost every movie by far.A great and inspiring experience."
"You have seen aamir khan as an actor in many beautiful films, He is called the perfectionist of the Hindi movie industry and want to know why again then go ahead and watch this beautiful film.For the first time he is on the director's seat and guys has handled the project very beautifully. Not even a single second you will feel bore with the film and at the end you will take some thing with you while you leave your seat.great performance by the child artist, if you keep all the performances of this year on one side and performance of this child on other side, you will feel that this child is the best of all.On the whole a great film to watch which not only entertains you but make's you to love children's and make you to understand that they have a world of there own. Just go and watch this film."
"This movie was a great surprise. It was creative, beautiful, and intelligent. It is difficult to find flaws with a movie which promotes good and shows the way forward.Being from a western culture, there was things in the movie I struggled to accept such as the dialogue, music and length of the movie but as I watched it, the message or spirit of the movie caused me to see it in a different light and to see the struggle as my own limitation.A very touching movie about two of the most important things in life, learning and love. It may not be a movie for everyone, but I hope it will be for I believe whats taught in this movie would do wonders in improving the quality of life.Judged by western eyes ""flaws"" can be found in the movie as it is very different, but it promotes me to wonder if the true ""flaws"" are not in only accepting what is ""normal"" or what we are familiar with, a judging it in a similar way as the boy in movie was judged.This may be the best movie I have seen all year."
"Well, some films are bad, some are good. Some films are great, some are superb. But there are a handful of films that come once in a while to create a new landmark in the history of Cinema. They are above of those mere 'good' 'great' adjectives and the only way to describe them is by telling the person ""Go and see for yourself!"" Taare Zameen Par is among those rare & remarkable films that may change your life once you see it.So I'm not going to spend anymore words describing how brilliant the movie is and how you may end up crying not in sadness but in joy instead, the only thing I can say is watching Taare Zameen Par is mandatory regardless of whoever you are and whatever you do. 'Stars on Earth' is itself a glittering Star came down from the sky as a Christmas & New Year present for everyone."
"Congrats Aamir Khan!!!! Kudos!! A very very touching movie..!! Not a typical commercial movie, not an Aamir-Khan movie either... you will not even remember to note how smart Aamir is looking; the story will take you away.Strangely, the story line is not very unpredictable. I mean, we all know what is going to happen to the kid. But, somehow so much reality and feeling has been poured into the story line, you will not even blink.Ishaan is a 8 year old kid, who is a complete day-dreamer and study-phobic, literally. His attitude towards reality and conventional study becomes torture to his parents as regular complaints are received from teachers, neighbors. Ishaan's strict father sends him to hostel overnight. Ishaan is suddenly burdened with all the discipline and conventional ways. When he cannot cope up with that, he is continuously discouraged by everybody, which breaks his confidence. In addition, he isolates himself from his family, as they left him in this insensitive world of disciplined humans, who do not care about his problem and only want proper standard textbook behavior, by cane or pain.At this point a sensitive and understanding temporary teacher joins the school, which changes peoples lives and way of thinking. Sorry, don't want to give away any more than this.Aamir Khan did a splendid job, both in acting and directing. Tisca Chopra looked and acted exactly like a vulnerable mother of a young confused child. Other actors in the movie were properly chosen and none of them did leave a chance to criticize. However, the best Part is Darsheel Safary. This little kid is so realistic and so convincing, that you CANNOT control your tears. God....!!! Where did he learn that much acting!! He is the hero of the movie and the backbone too.Anybody having even a nut-sized heart will love this movie. After all, we were kids too!!!"
"Another one from the Aamir Khan stable with him in his elements. Amir Khan has been, from the launch of his first movie, a little ahead of contemporary Hindi cinema. He has proved one more time that he is maturing in the art of movie making/acting. Simply said that's his way of sharing his evolving experience. Much in contrast to actors who tend to stagnate. It's about a special child ""Ishaan Awasthi"", who seems to see life from a different perspective, not because he wants to, but thats the way God perhaps created him. His ambitious father however sees him, as they say in the movie, as another horse that he needs to breed for the ""race called life & career"". An illustration of middle-class India in its battle for survival of the fittest. The father overlooks the probability that his 8-year old is perhaps not meant for the regular races, and pushes him further into isolation by packing him off to a boarding school. While the kid battles the indifference and taunts thrown at him, Amir Khan, his art teacher, lets him free his imagination and creativity and bring forth the special quality Ishaan has and not the other so-called regular kids.Ishaan wins an art competition, gets on the cover of his school's year book and begins to be coveted by all. That's quickly said, but watching the movie is bit of a dramatic experience especially if you are watching with women around. Man!! they cry a lot!!"
"WOW - the only word that comes to mind to describe this movie.10 minutes into the movie and the tears started.I gave this movie a 10 for one reason only. ISHAAN. I don't think there is a single bollywood actor that could make me relate to them as this boy did. His pain, torment, confusing, hesitation.. every emotional he feels you feel it too.Amir Khan has out done himself. Not only is he a phenomenal actor but now he is a master as a director.Yes all is well at the end of the movie and this by no means is how it is realistically but when you are watching a movie you have to keep one thing in mind IT IS A MOVIE it is OK if the director/story-writer wants you to leave the cinema with a good feeling it is not necessary to put reality into everything.Final words... you don't have to watch this in a cinema in fact i think you should buy/rent it on DVD and watch it with the family.. and a word for the wise HAVE LOTS OF TISSUES HANDY because this film guarantees water works :D 10/10"

This is what you call MARVELLOUS!!! I have become a die hard fan of Aamir for his unique way to express his love for every child... it is really astonishing to see that child indisputably a great actor.i am highly influenced by the acting skills of Tisca Chopra too..Music was lively.I Haven't SEEN A MOVIE LIKE THIS.. The craze for this movie was evident when i saw people rushing to have tickets at the box office.. I also got the ticket after a great fuss. Enthusiasm of elders was very much noticed.. They have just come to see that brilliant child artist whom they saw in promos..Aamir has proved he can be a great director too..with such a triumphant script..HATS OFF!!STANDING OVATION!
"""Taare Zammen Par"" is not just a movie, its a emotional journey into the life of an ordinary Indian child. This truly depicts the life of an average Indian household, its very true that a lot of stress is being paid on being on the top, ranking first in studies. Parents don't want to admit that their child needs help just because they don't want others(family, friends, neighbors...) to say anything. They feel as if such thing reflects on themselves: ""How can my son/daughter be so and so"". They ignore the needs of the child to maintain their false ego in front of others. This movie takes the viewer into a life an average person can relate to, nothing fantasy. Its a must see for the parents who believe their child is infallible. A wonderful movie!"
"People were clapping, girls were crying with tears rolling down their cheeks, boys were spell bound and every child, every person in the hall seemed to be taken aback by the brilliance of this movie. This is a class act, a marvelous concept and direction to perfection makes this flick different from others, which is always the quality of an 'A' movie. It is the movie of a lifetime; sincerely I would say this is one of the best Hindi movies I have ever seen. It is not a roller coaster of emotions or just another emotional drama; this is the story of a child who was just left alone with his misery. Aamir comes to his help and becomes his only hope. Aamir is not the hero he comes in the second half, actually Darsheel Safari can be described in one word as ""Outstanding"".This is a serious Oscar attempt. I am happy that this time if we nominate this, we have a movie which we will not be shy of sending for Oscars. Aamir once again proves that film making is not everyone's job. One class act, one nice movie is all I want from a year; I don't want a pile of crap. As it finished, people were not ready to go, they were still there, sitting and watching those credits rolling.If you miss this, I have no words to tell you what you will miss. GO FOR IT."
"I had just watched the film last night and after that, I was discussing it with a friend, a fellow IMDb member. For me 'Taare Zameen Par' was indeed an enjoyable film and I liked how the research was done on dyslexia as many Hindi films seem to lack that. Also technically it's quite well made. The use of animation is endearing and cinematography is brilliant. I love the songs too.As a director, Aamir Khan does a fine job. Amole Gupte deserves equal credit for giving the film a heart of gold. The screenplay isn't bad but I found the placement of the title song awkward. I mean it seemed to drag things a little. The sequences in the song may have been necessary but the song itself was a strange placement.Also the character development especially of the parents and the few plot holes could have been improved. For instance, how is it that a stay-at-home mom not know at all that her son has learning problems? How did he make it to third grade? The parents are shown to be from an educated family. The parents claim to have thought that the reading problems were a result of his lack of interest and perhaps, they were in denial too as they didn't want to accept that he cannot read because it would mean that he's 'mentally retarded' but none of this is explored and we just get the impression that they didn't know. The child's also shown to repeat the 3rd grade but his classmates look older than him. Even Aamir Khan's characterization seems a little flawed. The character might be that of a very sensitive person but the way he broke down at all the children was a little unbelievable especially since he's known as an experienced teacher in India who would be used to seeing such problems.While some may argue that the teachers are demons, I have gone to school in that part of the world and myself have encountered such 'demons'. Hence it's not completely unbelievable but I agree that not every single teacher should have been shown as demons. However, I find the sudden transformation of the teachers from 'demonhood' very unbelievable. Also, that Hindi literature teacher is mind-numbingly stupid. The kid gave a simple yet fantastic interpretation of the poem and he doesn't get that? What a moron! And this is supposed to be in a prestigious school? I also thought it was awkward bringing Abhishek Bachchan as an Indian example of a 'dyslexic super-achiever' especially since he's mentioned with names like Picasso, da Vinci, Christie and Einstein.Though some may argue that the competition sequence mislead the viewer regarding children with learning disabilities in one area can be supremely gifted in other areas, I think it was probably there to move the story further and give it a happy ending. Perhaps at the end, they could have also stressed on the fact that every child deserves love (no matter what) and attention and effort so that he can achieve his true potential. This point was brought up in the conversations between the teacher and the parents but if it was stressed at the end of the film, it would have made 'Taare Zameen Par' more impactive. Then again, the film is more Ishaan's story and with this competition he has to get back his confidence, that was previously shattered. What about this for an alternative ending? The kid loses the competition but his work is praised and everyone appreciates his effort, his parents still accept and love him and he's happy? 'Taare Zameen Par' belongs to child actor Darsheel Safari. His performance is very natural and he shines throughout the whole film. It's one of the best acting by a child actor. His bunny tooth smile is adorable. Aamir Khan is mostly decent although he does seem to go over the top in some scenes. The actor who plays the dad is awful and Tisca Chopra is okay. The teachers are caricatures.In spite of its flaws, 'Taare Zameen Par' might be a called manipulative but in my humble opinion it is a sincere film. I just loved how it portrays the mind and imagination of a child using animation and art (note the wonderful reference to Calvin and Hobbes) and also the natural behaviour we see in young Safary especially when he bunks class. Some other examples are how he tried his best to read but just can't be bothered anymore because he simply cannot do it, how he's fascinated by things others take for granted or simply ignore, how his confidence is broken when his parents leave him and teachers beat him, the look on his face when someone calls him 'duffer', his lack of interest in daily activities (e.g. playing with water when he's supposed to take a shower). All his scenes are worth watching and that alone makes 'Taare Zameen Par' a pleasant viewing."
"I couldn't sleep the whole night after watching this movie last night thinking about it and thinking about its message. No other movie has ever moved me so much.It's not only highly creatively made, well-directed and original but has a huge message that we ought to learn from.Life is really not about getting the top grades and competing with others. We really have to learn that ourselves and teach that to our children to fix the problem at the grassroot level.Kudos to Darsheel on his unbelievably natural acting. In fact, kudos to everybody for their great acting, great direction, and great everything that went into making this masterpiece."
"Saw it today and this is the best movie by far of 2007 .. In every aspect its a punch .. Child Artist darsheel safary gives out the best child performance ever n Aamir khan well what can i say about him he is the definition of the word perfectionist .. TZP truly delivers,Aamir khan is god he's shaping up to be the best thing ever happened to Indian cinema .. The movie has its own magic just like the latest top-grosser ""into the wild"" by Hollywood actor/director sean penn.. Well AK is easily shaping up to be the Sean Penn of Indian cinema ! And this shows that he's in a totally different league as compared to other biggies .. Easily the best directorial debut i'v ever seen hope AK lives up to his standards in his next as a director .. Eagerly waiting for LAJJO .. In the end would like to conclude by saying everyone should go and watch this movie its the most beautiful thing ever happened in Indian cinema so don't miss it !! TZP Rocks !!"
"When someone goes to watch an Aamir Khan movie, what does he\she expect?1. Brilliant performance\efforts 2. Tight story 3. Some relevant social message 4. and the USP ...something different that will blow your mind!! Here the USP is Aamir's direction and his total commitment to his script.This latest effort of Aamir is simply brilliant! Told in a very simplistic manner the film touches your heart and takes you through a roller-coaster of emotions. Even though the protagonist has dyslexia the story could have been of any child. The movie speaks about the pressure a child faces in today's competitive world and how he\she tries to match parents' expectations. But, never once does it get preachy.There are many brilliant moments in the movie and will not spoil them for you by highlighting any one specifically. Watch this movie to realize a reality which most are oblivious to. Watch this movie for it's brilliant story, performance and direction. Watch this movie if u r an Aamir fan.. Watch this movie if u r not an Aamir fan and I promise u will become one after watching...and watch this movie to encourage such movies to be made in India and let the world acknowledge our cinema!"
"Aamir Khan's debut directorial performance is an astounding feat. Its product is one of the best films of 2007. And I'm not just talking about Bollywood. Taare Zameen Par is a different type of film that does not conform to the typical norms of the masala industry. It is a breath of fresh air that does just enough on the predictable side to reel in typical Hindi film audiences. However, at no point does Taare Zameen Par conform to the standards of melodrama or impossibility and fantasy. The characters are of a different mold. The actors and actresses that portray the roles are even more different. There are no big-budget stars in this movie besides Aamir himself. The main character, Ishaan Awasthi, portrayed by Darsheel Safary is a young dyslexic boy who struggles to read and write. Hidden underneath his math and reading difficulties, lies a talent unnoticed by the ""Jame Raho"" lifestyle. Darsheel does a fantastic job as Ishaan who reminds us of our old childhood days and evokes tons of emotion from the audience. He is in fact the main character of the film with Aamir Khan appearing only after the intermission. The scenes and settings are colorful and vibrant. The crowded streets of Mumbai are beautifully shot while the New Era boarding school also possesses its own sense of foreboding upon Ishaan's entrance. The songs are also quite a treat. I can't say that I really minded any of the songs of the movie although a few seemed unnecessary. The lyrics in some of the songs are fantastic and the music throughout the film is coherent of the theme: light and simple yet bewilderingly and colorfully complex. The story itself is a great one. Aamir plays the unorthodox temporary art teacher who changes the life of Ishaan through his unconventional practices. We are reminded to appreciate our childhood and remember that every child is special. The film does at some points tend to get a little melodramatic and slightly predictable; however, these are the elements that adhere to the standards of the majority of Hindi films. Therefore, it isn't necessarily a bad thing but it isn't a good thing either. Moreover, Ishaan's volte-face from a confused, misunderstood child to an overachieving and talented painter is brushed over a little too quickly. In my opinion, the scenes when Ram Shankar Nikumbh (Aamir Khan) works with Ishaan are some of the best of the film and I would have appreciated it if they would have made his learning experience even more believable. Nonetheless, those scenes still carry a powerful resonance like most of the film. Overall, the film is a delight. It isn't the conventional Hindi film nor does it stray too far from accepted norms. It's always good to see a different type of film especially one that is so emotionally resounding. It reminds us that we all have purpose and most importantly, that children are the most precious thing we can lose and our only measure of wealth. The film has certainly given me a new outlook on life as well as entertained me. What more could I ask for?"
"Taare Zameen Par is an excellent movie and I recommend everybody to watch it.The last movies of Aamir Khan : Earth, Lagaan, Mangal Pandey, Rang De Basanti were all good movies as compared to the stupid repeating stories that other actors (such as Shah Ruck Khan) would play and cheered by the foolish public.I am shocked that a movie like Om Shanti Om with such bad scripts and performances is rocking in India. Is it a blind love for Shah Ruck Khan or the majority of Indian people prefers stupid movies Taare Zeeman Par is the first Indian Movie of this year which made my heart cry and laugh.Faara and Karan have a lot to learn from Aamir..."
"Here is the deal this time. If you are sensible, you are gonna get crushed. This movie is deep in so many aspects of our society, and at the same time deals with everything in such a cute and delicate way, that one cannot watch this and feel nothing. The movie talks about a boy that has dyslexia and is miss interpreted by everything he cares about. It is touching at the same time it is critic. The entire history is permeated with subtle irony and heavy criticism about the contemporary way of doing things and solving problems. Talks about the objectification of persons in order the achieve our own personal goals... well, there is so much to this movie that I believe I just got lost here. Lets get to the point, this movie is just beautiful. Completely amazing. Who should watch? Everyone. I'm not going to talk about moods in this one since it is so important because of its contents... Just watch it."
"The movie ideally reflects the situation in my family - my daughter is the best at school, I never even cared what she does over there, and my boy is just like this poor guy from the movie... Many parents wouldn't even believe such children exist. And I think movie doesn't touch those parents. I really believe Aamir experienced similar childhood, as he reflected that unbelievably comprehensively - I really see my son there. Really.That's a healing movie. I recommend it to all parents and especially to Teachers. It also reminds me Pink Floyd's - just another brick in the wall - thats what school wants to make of each child.Absolute masterpiece - 10/10"
"Taare Zameen Par, which spells ""Stars on Earth"" in English is probably one of the most anticipated films of the year 2007 by Bollywood. It came out in December last year, and it got received with a blast, and director Aamir Khan was extremely happy with the final outcome. One of the factors which distinguishes TZP from other Indian movies, is that it is not based on the regular cliché of two individuals falling in love, but rather puts a real subject in the limelight. The story follows the nine-year-old protagonist called ""Ishaan""(Darsheel Safary). Ishaan is a brisky young boy, with a wild imagination. He loves to admire nature, and enjoys painting with bright freshening colors. The one thing he hates the most is to sit down and do his homework. He never manages to write a word correctly and letters seem to dance in front of his eyes, whenever he attempts to read a sentence. This rare condition sets a barrier between Ishaan and education, and leads to frustration. Ishaan eventually tries to ignore his homework and school because of countless episodes of outbursts from teachers and his parents. His exam papers are a pity for the human eye and Ishaan's teachers say that there is no hope for him. Ishaan's father takes this personally and decides to send Ishaan to a boarding school.Ishaan disagrees with his father of course, as he is not accustomed to living without his mother. Ishaan's mother falls in a dilemma, but ultimately decides that sending Ishaan to boarding school would be the wisest choice.Things get even worse when Ishaan gets into boarding school. It is a strict school with discipline as their main principle. Ishaan is welcomed by strict teachers in every class, and receiving punishment from every teacher soon becomes a part of his daily routine. Ishaan eventually stops talking to anyone and usually meets everyone with a scared eye.One day, a substitute teacher replaces Ishaan's regular arts teacher. Ram Shankar Nikumbh(Aamir Khan) is his name, and he makes a grand entrance with a song. He is well received among Ishaan's fellow students, but Ishaan is still upset with a sore face. Ram instructs his students to paint anything which comes to their mind using vivid colors. Every child paints whatever comes to their mind, with the exception of Ishaan, who usually loves to paint. Ram is a little worried for Ishaan, but he does not torture him with questions and lets him go. However, Ram's concern over Ishaan's behavior is intensified after several days of his reticence.Ram tries further investigation and analyzes Ishaan's textbooks in all of his subjects. He discovers something unusual. It seems to him that Ishaan always misspells certain words and letters in a particular way. He has trouble identifying himself with different letters and their sound. Ram is stunned by seeing Ishaan's textbooks, and wants to investigate even further, and decides to visit Ishaan's family.When Ram tries to explain that Ishaan has difficulties identifying himself with letters and words he is met with rude comments from Ishaan's father. Ishaan's father has always assumed that Ishaan was avoiding doing homework because of his laziness. After a dialog between Ram and Ishaan's father, Ram tries to convince him that Ishaan really has a disability. After his investigation, he concludes the problem as dyslexia. Of course, Ishaan's parent are not aware of this learning disability and are scared for their sons future. Ram responds to this comment by saying that nowadays all parents care about is how to make their sons and daughters toppers of their classes. How they can make them excel in every subject, even though they have to work day and night. Every child is special, and should be allowed to pursue their dreams.When Ram begins his arts class back at school he begins by telling a story. A story about a boy, a boy who had difficulties during childhood. Letters and numbers seem to dance before his eyes and he never remembered that ""y"" comes after ""x"". After countless attempts he failed once at school and got dishearted. He decided to take the defeat as a man and continued working. After a time his mind brightened and his mind discovered a treasure. After telling the story, Ram asks his class which boy he is talking about. Ishaan's heart starts to beat much faster, as he is doubts that it is him, Ram is talking about. Ram shows a picture of Albert Einstein. Albert Einstein also had dyslexia, but he managed to overcome it and is considered one of the biggest scientists of human history. These encouraging words brightens Ishaan and he becomes really good friends with Ram. Ram goes to the principle of the school to discuss Ishaan's dyslexia. The principle is shocked at first, and then assembles the puzzles and sees the picture. He appreciates Ram's work with Ishaan and suggests to send Ishaan to a special school for children with disabilities. Ram disagrees to his suggestion and requests him to tell all the teachers to ignore his mistakes for a few weeks. In that period of time, Ram can work with Ishaan and improve his skills.I think I have revealed more than necessary, but I will leave it here and let you watch the movie for yourself.TZP is a film which combines emotions with real life situations and the outcome is mind- blowing. It delivers a great message and has opened eyes of millions of parents around the world. This film exceeded all of my high expectations and I came out satisfied after watching it. Darsheel Safary has done a great job as a child artist and his performance has earned him a handful of Indian awards. I really hope to see more of him. Aamir Khan is great as always as an actor, but has also done a excellent job as a director."
"When the movie is about to release, i saw the promos and thought the movie will be good for serious cine-goers who believe in quality cinema. But it proved me wrong when i saw the movie. Though Aamir Khan directed the movie, the script and dialogues belong to Amol Gupte. I would like to thank both Amol and Aamir, first the former for getting involved with the script so much and enlightening us and kudos to Aamir for bringing out stellar performances from almost all the artists. Most of them lived their character rather than acting in it.Everybody knows Aamir always tries to bring best music in his movies which he act. So its no surprise that the music is great in the movie. Thanks to Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy and prasoon joshi for those amazing lyrics.P.S: I donno Hindi, i watched the movie first in theatre without subtitles . This movie proved the saying ""language is no barrier for good cinema"". Later i watched so many times with subtitles. I love the lyrics of the songs.But how many ever times i watch my eyes fill with tears at the climax scene."
"Let me commence by saying that I rarely see Hindi movies for one main reason. And that is a majority of them are mainly 'love stories'. Love story between a boy and a girl (and vice versa). No matter how many twists and turns there may be, the essence of the film revolves around the boy and girl end up being together and loving each other and 'living happily ever after'.But this movie is not the case and if you are into seeing Amir Khan love story films than you will be bitterly disappointed. Let me warn you right now that this movie will not be for you. This movie is for the Amir Khan fans who admire him for his versatile film types and also for movie critics who has to rate movies for the sake of rating them. By far this is the best film I have seen starring Amir Khan. For the record, I am not an Amir Khan fan.It a movie that displays three human characteristics that is so prominent in our human society. They are: i) Not everyone is born equal with the same intelligence, cognitive and learning level; ii) How much of an a**hole and blind parents can be when they selfishly and eagerly want their children to achieve something that they (they as in the children) may not want to achieve because it is not in their heart; and iii) A child's imagination, wonders and thoughts is something that was in all of us when we were little but is lost as we are exposed to the corrupt elements of the world.The character build up within the film was great. The main attraction of the film was Ishaan Awasthi played by Darsheel Safary. The film was well crafter and progressed at a pace that really made you realize what the world is and can be like from a child's point of view who has trouble reading, writing and understanding things of general. Darsheel Safary was brilliant as the leading character. The expression on his face said it all when he was being put down by his parents, neighbourhood kids and teachers. His performance really makes your mind and eyes open to issues that intellectually disabled kids face on a daily basis. It gave a view of the dangers people with disability/ies may face if they are not properly looked after to build up a base for them.As mentioned above, not everyone is born equal. But given the chance, opportunity and support by people, then the person with disability can head towards the right direction and be successful in life in his/her own way and rights. And this is the most important element that this movie was able to show.The key to success is not by how much money or materialistic things that you may have, but rather what you have achieved how you have achieved it. And this is something else the film displays. Ishan not only achieved the basic understanding of school literacy within his year level but achieved even greater success with something that came naturally to him. And that is his passion for art. His teacher played by Amir Kahn achieved success by bringing out this talent in his student and showing to his colleagues and Ishan's peers the great potential that he has inside of him.On a personal note, its funny how as parents, most of them don't see the potential talents that their children have inside of them. To them if their children are not doctors, lawyers or engineers then they are nothing. That is dead wrong!! If you think about it, most of the successful people in the world were not straight A students at school but rather they struggled during their school years. Rupert Murdoch, John Major (former British Prime Minister), Sylvester Stallone and Richard Branson are just to name a few.For those of you who are struggling or have struggled in school with homework, watch this movie as it may be an inspiration to you to pursue with what is inside your heart."
"Bollywood has always been deprived of such movies. Aamir Khan, a talented actor, ventures into directing a movie, a movie which is a bit different, and does it brilliantly. The movie starts with story of 8 year old, naughty kid, Ishan. Ishan has played a role of a boy who is very poor at studies. But his thought process is a bit different than others and his mind, very creative!! His parents are really worried about his future. Due to regular complaints about him from School, building etc his dad decides to send him to a boarding school. And this is where the movie takes a real turn. The story then takes us to the problems faced by the boy, his mental stress and then very emotional relationship between him and his arts teacher (Aamir). The flow of movie is just awesome. It is full of emotions. Though the movie is about a kid, it is meant to be watched by parents along with their children. I think this movie certainly deserves a spot in IMDb top 250. Also after so many years, a Bollywood movie has given hope for an Oscar."
"If Bheja Fry asked questions to Hindi contemporary cinema, Taare Zameen Par should answer it. A movie is not worth watching unless it has a purpose. This purpose is encapsulated in a message, and delivered. Its simple.The purpose is to spread awareness about the pressure normal child carries at an age he should be experiencing completely the opposite, to highlight child labour, to what extent parents' expect a child to deliver and most importantly because of competition (population?) there is no place for failure, & the best way to avoid failure is to study.The message is encapsulated in the story of Ishant Awasthi(Darsheel Safary), who expresses solace in randomness, trusts his capacity to pluck symphony from noise. But every system has to be imperfect, and his unparalleled advantages arise from a congenital condition of mind. His hobbies are unentertained, his sufferings are treated excuses and he is about to be labeled incompetent by the world. His teacher (Aamir Khan), could be his only saviour.The delivery occurs through unique cinematography, expressions over whelming our hearts and Darsheel Safary.As it should be, the director(Aamir Khan) wants us to only ponder. After experiencing his effort, its not a choice most of us will have.."
"I already knew when I walked into the theatre - what the movie was gonna be about.. A kid with some disorder and how the open-minded new teacher rescues him and helps him beat the odds. Something like that..But even then, Aamir has managed to pull a rabbit out of the hat again. He made me cry my eyes out!The disorder here is dyslexia... the pointed comment on today's parents goading on their children relentlessly to be toppers. The lesson... each child is different.He got a new kid who holds the movie on his own till the interval, after which Aamir joins into the act. The movie begins with a frisky lil kid who lives in his own world.. how he can't read.. doesn't fit in with the rest... soon how he recedes into a shell. Finally how the new art teacher finds him again and brings him out. The music fits well into the movie and switches with the mood in the film. You feel for the kid, his mother, his family,Aamir may be accused of perfectionism and hijacking directors... but then he has proved he is too damn good at it. So shut up and watch!"
"Bollywood has felt the need for Child Themed movies as much as the fish needs the bicycle. Considering that, this movie comes as a fresh change, something that every movie lover could love forward to. Aamir Khan is his usual brilliant self but it is Darsheel Safary, the kid that steals the show all the way.Taare Zameen Par is a movie every young couple should watch -- Its a movie every parent with a teenage child must watch. Its a beautiful movie because it shows us how parents, with all the good intentions in their hearts, can still go wrong.The reason why I did not give this a ""9"" is because I thought the parents role could have been a little more defining. Since for most of the first half, the family of the child plays a role of importance, one hoped that they could carry some of it, if not all, to the second half as well. But overall, by the second half, the story has a good foundation and the protagonist of the movie takes it off from there. The songs are well sequenced and not ""just put there"". This has been an area that Bollywood has really improved over the last few years.Aamir Khan impresses with his behind the screen antics and considering that he directed himself and a nine year old kid while working on a very sensitive subject that must have involved a lot of background research -- all for the first time, I think he has done a brilliant job. I will not take away one thing from this man, who for all his brilliance, has often been misunderstood in the industry."
"Have we ever thought about how easy it would be for a Pied Piper to come and steal all our kids away ? It wouldn't take much, would it ? What do we really offer them, right now ? A life full of discipline and homework, an unyielding drive for progress, bound to timings, curriculum and the ever pervasive rat race ? Even when we do extra-curricular activities, we make it as bad as work - are we on time, are there special classes, how good are they, will they be successful ? When do we really let them just be kids, with their own special time ? Can't we just let them enjoy childhood, before they enter this big bad world of grown-ups and of adult rules ?Such are the thoughts that flit through the mind as you watch this Aamir Khan masterpiece, borne out of a lovely story woven by Amole Gupta and his wife Deepa Bhatia through their work with children over the years. Its about a eight year old kid, Ishaan Awasthi, who finds it difficult to focus on letters or numbers, to catch or throw a ball, to generally do the things we expect children to do. He has failed in the third standard, which is a major source of misery to his middle class parents, whose other son, Yohan, is a topper. The school is now threatening to throw him out since everything points to his failing again. He is a misfit, preferring to live in his world of dreams, finding solace in the company of animals or anything else that catches his fancy. He loves to paint, is good with jig-saws etc but these things of course, will not help you pass the exams. Borne out of frustration, as a kind of punishment, and also with a intent to help him improve through greater discipline, he is put in a boarding school. The discipline, rules and punishments there though, break his spirit instead, making him retreat into his shell. He stops communicating, stops painting, stops talking to his parents. And then a temporary art teacher joins, Ram Shanker Nikumbh, who has his own theories on how to teach children. This is outstanding heart-warming stuff, hats off to Aamir for once again taking on an off- beat topic and bringing it to life in his directorial debut. As he says in his note on the official site, to children and to childhood....And if they dare send another movie to the Oscars, they'll have to deal with me ! My full review is available on blogspot at my blog apurvbollywood. Thx"
"Being a keen observer of the art of movie making (mostly self observed and learned) I as a student of this genre was eager to see the product coming out of the stable of Aamir Khan  the Director. His venture as Producer, in Lagaan  did fetch him accolades worldwide, including the Oscar nomination. So would this next product also be so special? The story is about a 8 year old boy Ishaan (Darsheel Safary) who finds it difficult to concentrate on his studies and finds innocent pleasures in the worldly things around him. This attitude of Ishaan makes him a centre of laugh and taunt that leads to his cranky and odd behavior. His parents decide to send Ishaan to boarding school to improve his studies. Being away from parents Ishaan goes into a shell and looses all interest in everything around him. There enters a drawing teacher Ram Nikubh (Aamir Khan) who recognizes Ishaan's state and takes it on himself to bring back life in the boy's life.Aamir says that he worked with his friend, painter, writer, and Creative Director of the movie Amole Gupte for 3 years to make Taare Jameen Par. Credit to Aamir to take this simple, delicate and difficult subject in the first place and standing ovation for preciously presenting the simplicity of the story in the way it has to be presented. Aamir had with him all the star power and resources to hog the lime-light of the movie, but he renders himself to play a pivotal but side and supporting role. He gives the real burden of the movie on the tender shoulders of Ishaan, uff Darsheel  a great search by the casting crew. Darsheel carries the movie along with him, and drags us into his world with such an ease that the moments of Ishaan will remain in-grained in our memories forever as twinkling starlights. Kudos to this young and gifted actor! Wow  what a performance.Similar credit to the master script and screenplay  which is so strong in its narration, that it required somebody as sensitive as Aamir to produce and direct the movie. The story evolves slowly and sucks us into the movie. The background score and music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy is superb. The lyrics by Prasoon Joshi are worth hearing and reciting.I was thinking as a movie maker  what would I have changed in TJP? I think, I would have surely added 5-7 minutes in the recovery phase of Ishaan with an added sub-plot event. I would had made the teachers less clichéd and caricatured. I would have used a little more of long shots for the enormity of the emotional pleasure and loss of childhood.Understanding that Aamir must have made this movie in a shoe string budget  with mostly unknown or little known cast.This movie may not do great business like other Bollywood commercial movies, but it has its heart in the right place  where it should be. It gives out a very important message of seeing children and childhood  with immense treasure and not destroy it in today's cut throat competitive world we live in.My only comment to Aamir is that if he had released the movie in Europe, I would not have had seen a pirated copy of the movie (which I do not mind watching anyways), but I regret not going for big screen experience (that I love) for this wonderful gem of a movie that should be watched by every parent and teacher.(Stars 7.75 out of 10)"
"OK, so i may be a little biased as this movie is still fresh on my mind from last night. But when i look back on all the movies that I have seen, world cinema or mainstream bollywood, the one thing I can tell you for sure is that I have never cried so much throughout a movie! This movie makes you feel. I am not a mother, yet I could feel the separation during Ishaan's first day in hostel. I am not dyslexic and yet I could feel the humiliation and helplessness that Ishaan must've felt when mocked by the others...The movie has tackled the issue of dyslexia brilliantly. Subtly highlighting the obstacles a parent faces when accepting a dyslexic child and most importantly what a child goes through when he just cannot fit in... every scene is cinematic brilliance. The dream sequences, the paintings, the imagination... wonderfully done.Technically I am not even gonna comment. All I can say is that it is a Masterpiece. Every scene is going to take your breath away. I mean it.Go ahead and treat yourself to this piece of cinematic brilliance. And I am not saying it 'cos of the films superstar director, but really, TZP just goes to show what good cinema with a strong message can achieve.PS: The critic in me couldn't believe that I'd give any movie a 10. But really, as I write this I cant help admitting that this is one movie which I cannot rate. Any kind of rating will just belittle it."
"The Film has done great justice for the Children not only in India but overall, All praise for Aamir Khan, his writer and the Actora and the whole crew.Unfortunately, for many in India Dylexia is a not so well know a symptom. But in western countries this has been taken care of. There are many who have this kind of a problems. There are many more problems that kids have which go unnoticed and hope through this media we would be educating people who are unaware and help those kids to seen a better future. The child artist has done great justice to the role. Aamir plays the role of a teacher with great in-depth The concept was always there but putting in into screenplay is excellent There is no greater satisfaction than seeing a child with confidence I hope many more issues relating to such topic is brought to light in India."
"To start with, let me make it very clear that I am a fan of Aamir Khan's acting. I was waiting for Aamir Khan's latest movie as I have feel that there is always something extraordinary about his films. Rangeela, Sarfarosh, Ghulam, Lagaan, Rang De Basanti and even Mangal Pandey (which I thought had a strong performance from him) are all a testament to that belief. I was a little skeptical about this film as it appeared from the promos to be a very ordinary film.I was also wary of the film having an overdose of melodrama. So I was a little unsure entering into the cinema hall to watch the movie. The opening credits of the movie have an imaginative style. It was clear that something creative and beautiful was in store. I was proved right. The movie opens with an introduction to the main character Ishant Awasthi, staring wide eyed at fishes in a drain. The opening shot gives you an insight into the nature of the boy. It is revealed that Ishaan has already failed in Class III and is struggling to cope with his academics even in his 2nd year. The movie takes a very interesting and amusing ride through his adventures in school while giving a glimpses of his artistic capabilities and some hints of his problems. Ishaan's parents get fed up of his careless attitude to studies and send him to a boarding school. Move to a boarding school, away from the protective shell of his parents has a crushing effect on Ishaan and as a result he completely switches off and goes into a shell. His cheerful smile and fascination for arts completely vanishes. At this stage a new part time arts teacher - Ram Shankar Nikumbh enters the scene. He has captures the imagination of the students trough his innovative style of teaching and introduces the children to a completely new perspective, forcing them to think and imagine for themselves. Ram notices that Ishaan is not responding to any of his attempts at attracting interaction. He is curious about Ishaan and investigates about him and his performance in School. Ram discovers his problems and goes about bringing Ishaan out of his troubles and face life again. The 2nd half of the movie is awe-inspiring as the events unfold and some startling revelations are made. The scene where the teacher confronts Ishaan's parents to explain them about Ishaan's problem is very delicately done and brings out some very strong elements of Aamir's acting. The movie finally ends with a truly breathtaking finale, which serves to reinforce your faith in miracles. The pace of the movie is gentle and moves beautifully without slipping into melodrama. There are a million breathtaking moments in the film. The intense scenes are handled with subtlety. Aamir Khan as the teacher gives in an endearing performance without trying to outdo or overshadow anyone else. He comfortably stays in the background without stealing any scenes and at the same time coming to the fore when needed. The star of the movie is undoubtedly Darsheel Safary as Ishaan Awasthi who displays a wide range of emotions through his expressive eyes. He looks very believable and steals your heart within the first few minutes of the movie. To conclude, the movie is a winner mainly on 4 counts - a very strong and well written script by Amol Gupte, sensitive and simplistic storytelling at just the right pace, intense and brilliant performances by the cast of the movie, a lively and catchy music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy. Aamir Khan, the Director has truly arrived and I am pretty sure the movie is gonna bag a few awards. The movie is worth watching once and many times over. I can't wait for the DVDs to come out so I can lay my hands over one."
"I'm not a big fan of bollywood, I think it is getting a bit to commercialised ''dhoom 2''but Taare Zameen Par was just amazing. Amir Khan is for me the hardest working man is Cinema. He takes his movies so seriously (rang DE basanti). TZP is what I call great cinema,so much effort has gone in to this movie the music is superb and the acting is great. I just hope it gets in to the Oscar so everyone can appreciate how good this movie is. The message is portrayed so well by all the actors especially the little boy and his ''loving'' parents.It is easily on my list up with the great movies like Juno, stranger than fiction, matrix, spirited away i can't wait for Amir khan's next project. so please do watch this movie!"
"I saw Taare Zameen Par last night and I walked out of the theatre feeling that we're finally maturing as a movie making and watching country. For too long Bollywood has been associated with the typical ""masala"" movie. Its heartening to see that in the past 5 years or so, film makers have taken to making films about real issues without killing the fun of the entire celluloid experience. TZP would have probably been categorised as a ""art"" film about 6-8 years ago. TZP is about a child (Darsheel Safary) who suffers from dyslexia and his painting teacher (Aamir Khan) who helps him thru it. Safary is pretty good in his role as the confused yet earnest kid exuding innocence and mischief at the same time. Aamir Khan was absolutely terrible and thoroughly unconvincing in his role and if you believe that, you also believe that little green people orbiting Earth in flying saucers are about to abduct you. I've been a big fan of this particular Khan for a long time now. Despite being a fine actor, he's been part of some cinematic disasters. That being said, TZP is NOT one of them. I think long time fans of Aamir's work realise there was always some ghost-directing by him in a lot of his movies. It seemed inevitable that he would don the director's mantle at some point. Fortunately he had something that a lot of first time directors don't have - Aamir Khan the actor. On a side-note, the soundtrack is pretty cool. Prasoon Joshi's lyrics are simple and yet they strike a chord no matter what the mood of the song. Once again Shanker-Ehsaan-Loy prove why they are at the top of the game. I'm listening to my favourite song Kholo Kholo while writing this. Great stuff!Lastly, I've rated this movie an 8/10 only because i felt it was a tad too long. Perhaps I'm being a fussy nit... I'm not a regular Hindi movie watcher but i believe in the paisa-vasool philosophy completely. This is one of them. Go watch it with your parents and maybe you'll come out with a grand ole feeling of nostalgia like I did."
"This directorial debut by the ""perfectionist"" Aamir Khan carries the tag-line ""Every Child is Special"". Ishaan Avasthi, an 8 year-old, is a dreamer and dreams best in class. He is repeating 3rd grade and under-performing by a lot. He has a superstar sibling who aces all his tests and badminton. Ishaan is ridiculed by his teachers and classmates, berated by his ambitious father and pushed along by his harried mother. One day he bunks school and is packed off to an expensive boarding school, but things are no better for him there. He has but one friend, and the teachers continue to be tartars and caricatures - until a colorful sensitive substitute art teacher, Mr. Nikumbh, arrives and sees that Ishaan is locked up in his inward looking universe. Nikumbh is dyslexic and immediately knows that Ishaan too is suffering from dyslexia. He champions Ishaan's cause most vociferously  this includes telling the class that dyslexics can be geniuses  like Einstein, DaVinci, Abhishek Bachchan (???). Ishaan builds a most DaVinci like transport vehicle model out of twigs and knick-knacks he collects, begins to learn letters from Mr. Nikumbh, and eventually to READ. Then there is an art competition in which we see how fun filled and normal the teachers and kids really are, we see Ishaan winning and becoming the hero of the school and his parents. The movie ends with Ishaan running back in slow motion towards Nikumbh!! To call this well-intentioned fare bland would be unkind, after all it deals with learning disabilities and the message that parents need to love their kids no matter what, and kids need love to develop a sense of self worth. The film delivers the message in a fairly decent way that is several notches above public service messages. What is most likable is the protagonist Ishaan, played very well by Darsheel Safary. His buck toothed smile is used most effectively (not unlike the use of Michelle's wide eyes and duck walk in Black). Aamir plays Nikumbh in a preachy way that ranges from weeping at the drop of a hat to thunderous speeches delivered to the parents. Tisca Chopra is good as the harried and browbeaten mother. The father and all the other people associated with the educational system are caricatured to the maximum - they do help generate a lot of sympathy for Ishaan, but also some for the teaching profession that has been uniformly vilified here. The message gets muddled by Ishaan's winning the art competition  was it not that every child is special whether he has something special in him or not? Special schools are not spared either and branded as schools for retarded children. Again this is a less than desirable message about such schools that can focus expert teachers around kids that need them.The film does touch the child within all of us  that same child who did most of his thinking while sitting on the potty, spent time day dreaming about being Spaceman Spiff, did not care much about studies, and was sometimes sent out of class  for me it was with my desk and chair, for an entire day!! The music is excellent, and 'Maa' is heartrending. The art competition sequence is very well staged. But in the end one is less than satisfied with this story that has lots of black and white, but no shadows or nuances to many of the characters. We are not told much about Nikumbh (or any other character except the protagonist) and there is no enigma to him to make us care to know more. Overall this movie is a decent effort, well intentioned and exceptionally well shot in parts."
"It's not everyday that a movie takes you with itself on a journey and lives you in a state of mind, where you don't know whether to appreciate the simple narration that touched your heart or to get thinking on the questions raised in your mind. Come to express what you felt, no words can do any justice to the experience called ""Taare Zameen Par"". No doubt it was a untold story with great potential. But, we always have great untold stories around us, which are waiting to see the daylight or should I say screen light. What we don't have is people who can venture into these projects and make sure that they build a strong bridge or should I say screenplay, that connects the story and the audience. Thanks to prior attempted bridges devastated by box office cinematic conditions. Aamir not only decided to swim against the tide with this story , but also did a great job as a first time director. Aamir's presence did made sure that audience makes it to the movie hall. But, from that point on it's Amole Gupte's screenplay and Darsheel Safary's performance that holds the movie together. Darsheel Safary plays the central character of the movie ""Ishaan"", who is a 8 year old boy, who lacks complete interest in studies. The movie starts with the outside world of Ishaan, where no one seems to understand his problem and eventually takes the audience into Ishaan's inside world. Once you are into his world, your ears can hear the silence on his lips and eyes can feel the pain in his tears. But you're not sure how to help him. Yes, I said ""help him"" because now Ishaan's journey is no more on screen. You are into the journey along with him and that's why you start thinking for him , instead waiting to see what unfolds on screen. The screenplay holds you so tight that you are only and only with Ishaan. Even when the songs come , they flow so smoothly in and out of the movie that you don't bother to tap your foot or think if the music is good or if this song was required. Shankar, Ehsaan and Loy have added lot of feathers to their musical cap, but ""Taare Zameen Par"" is a precious stone added to their cap. That's how beautiful their work is. Prasoon Joshi's lyrics feel like they are embedded into the script of the movie. They don't stand out as songs. Prasoon has proved his way with words before, but this movie demanded more than writing caliber and he does come out with flying colors. Setu's cinematography perfectly balanced the inner and outer world of Ishaan. The camera work did complete justice to the screenplay, by making sure we see the movie thru Ishaan's eyes. The great film captured on lens got perfect scissors on editing table. Deepa Bhatia's editing was so smooth that you just don't feel the presence of her scissors throughout the narration and that tells me she knows her job too well. Coming to background score, sometimes they are so overwhelming that take over the scene and sometimes they take backseat and softly add to the feel good or feel sad mood of the scene. But here, I seriously don't remember getting any feel for the presence of background score. It was neither in the background nor foreground, it was part of the scene and that too me was quite amazing. Coming to the performances, as I said before Darsheel Safary is a great find and Aamir as always is Aamir. One actor who really surprised me was ""Tisca Chopra"" , extremely delighted with her portrayal of Ishaan's mom. I think, more than kids this movie is a must see for parents. Back in India, even before the child enjoys the childhood , he is thrown into the competitive world and expected to excel only in academics. Hopefully this movie will bring in some change in the way we look at kids who don't come out with flying colors in their exams. Finally, Aamir's bridge connecting Ishaan and audience totally ROCKS..! and I hope we will walk on more bridges like this one."
"""Taare Zameen Par"" means stars on ground and Aamir Khan has proved to be one of those stars capable of projecting a good and decent story on to the screens as well as being a good actor, An eight year old boy, Ishaan, is in a world that seems to be filled with what no one else can understand - not even his teachers at the school that he goes to. They all punish him for the mistakes that he makes and one day, this leads to him missing his school as well as Maths test. Later, on returning home, he informs his elder brother about it and asks him to write a sick note to the teacher. Next day, the note is found after school time and his parents, after meeting the teachers and the headmistress, decide that it is time to send him to a Boarding School.After ""Fanna"", ""Rang De Basanti"" and ""The Rising - Ballad Of Mangal Pandey,"" Aamir Khan has come with an excellent story tag: ""Every child is special"" in this movie and I would not hesitate to agree with him. Not only that, but the child actors can be considered to be the real stars of this movie as well as all the other cast, including Aamir Khan himself, who doesn't appear until almost intermission. Filmed in the hill station area of Panchgini and Mumbai, not all songs are good but one that is worth listening to is the title song it self. Written by Amole Gupte, Aamir khan, in his first Directorial debut, has accomplished something unique in this movie and has gone onto highlight as to what a child, as well as an adult can be suffering from - Dyslexia, which is a Greek word and means ""difficulty with words."" Not only that but it is varying in severity, from person to person and it can range from difficulties with spelling to severe problems with reading."" But people with this problem, sometimes have either normal or above average intelligence but yet perform below that ability in reading and writing than in other tasks such as those of no reading. It is estimated, that here in the UK, 4% of the population is dyslexic and a further 6% suffer from mild to moderate problems related to this. A lot of people may not even know that they have this condition, or, even that their child has it. This is mainly existent in male than in a female and it is genetic and therefore tends to be passed on. Just recently, there was a case, which I had heard about in India, where a woman did not know that her son was suffering from Dyslexia until she did some research when she was informed. Today her son is at a university in the USA. This just shows how many more people there are in the world who may be suffering from this and may not know about it.The child artist, Darsheel Safferey has been nominated for this year's award for ""Best Actor"" for his role as ""Ishaan,"" while Amir Khan has been nominated for ""Best Supporting actor. Darsheel, aged nine, is the first child artist to have been nominated in this category in the history of ""Bollywood"" and will be against the likes of Shah Rukh ""King"" Khan (for ""Chak De India"" and ""Om Shanti Om""), Abhishek Bachchan and Akshaye Kumar.I praise Aamir Khan for making such a movie. There have been other movies relating to children stories but only this one has really been so touchy, it has brought a change to the normal movies that have been released and contain glamour, glitz, catchy tunes and music. This is a movie that is worth watching."
"There is always a hype surrounding an Amir Khan movie. It's not the commonly masala type movie which we are used to seeing featuring the likes of Sharukh Khan or Akshay Kumar. Nor are they overtly stereotyped like movies of Kay Kay Menon or Manoj Bajpai. When it comes to Amir Khan it's all about being in the mean, and it's all about perfectionism. This is his directorial debut, and he duly delivers the goods.He chose the topic of the movie very carefully, combo-ed it with a master script. Add to the fact, he had Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy to o some amazing tunes, and lastly he sought out a cast, which is almost unknown, yet gave a stellar performance. I mean, really, I cannot recall any of the actors apart from Amir Khan from any movie, TV show, etc. And the kid Darsheel, deserves to go into the Hall of Fame. I cannot recall someone giving such a good debut performance ever since Amjad Khan in Sholay, and that's telling something, since there has been loads of brilliant actors since then.The story is relatively simple. There is this boy, who is disinterested in anything that is remotely related to academics. When he fails in third grade, his parents shift him to a boarding school against his wishes. This breaks his mental state and he goes into a shell. But with the help of a new teacher, who convinces his parents that he suffers from a rare state of neural disorder called Dyslexia, he helps him on the path to recovery. In the end all his well, the boy is treated as a rare genius, the teacher becomes his closest confidant.This all appears to be a simple story, but it is culminated to a treat to the eyes with some magnificent direction and some mind boggling acting both on the part of young Darsheel and Amir. Add to that the fact that there was some serious good visual effects, something which is totally absent in all Bollywood movies, and superb music from Shankaar-Ehsaan-Loy. The tracks were brilliant and cleverly used throughout the movie. There's this rebellious track, much similar to Floyd's ""Another Brick in the Wall"", which mirrors the turmoil state of mind of our young friend when he is sent to a boarding school. Also, there's the sad track which tells us about the sense of loneliness, of betrayal, when he is left at the boarding school in his first night.A lot of word has been spoken about Amir Khan's credibility as a director, about his overtly sense of perfectionism. Well, if this is his first test, then he gets flying colors. Apart from a very short sequence in the movie which is animated, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The photography, and the direction is impeccable. And once again I have to say that young Darsheel was fabulous. There are fanatics who are craving to give Deepica Padukone the best débutante award. I'd say after Taare Zameen Par, ""Deepica who ?? Give the award to Darsheel, its a walkaway.""I'd like to touch up on another point. This movie was an emotional experience for many. I found many people leaving the theaters with tears in their eyes. I can understand their state of mind. There may be many parents, whose child did not turn up as brilliant as they assumed they would. I also found hordes of children flocking to see this movie. Well, after seeing it, I didn't find any reason to think that this is a movie for children. I mean sure, this movie features a kid, but it isn't for kids, its a film about kids, but not the other way around.A superb experience. 9/10 !!!"
"I am still overwhelmed after the show has long ended. It's has been an enriching roller coaster ride back to my childhood days. The emotions of the child artiste in the movie has left a big impression in me.He is truly amazing to say the least (the real hero of the movie).We all know the movie is all about a child who fails to impress one and all due to a disease (dyslexic) which no one realizes or try to realize. He is packed off to a boarding school to get it right and that's when the world is teared apart for the child. He seems to be betrayed, he goes into a shell till to the point when a new teacher re-discovers his inability and helps him fight back to the main stream of life.Many may think it to be non-entertaining stuff or non-masala but once credit comes up at the end of the movie, they will bite there words as it is both entertains and enriches us. As I said it will be overwhelming experience for one and all.Watch it, it will worth every penny you spend. Thanks Aamir for showing us a sensible, emotional, enriching movie like TZP."
"Bollywood is the eternal caricature of flamboyant glitterati and endless dance sequences to woo audiences with mindless aberrations from the mundane. The greatest achievement of Taare Zameen Par is that this film has effortlessly achieved all of this with just sheer sensitivity.It takes you out of the world of the mundane, only to turn you back to the little nuances that make the mundane so special.A drop of orange, with swirling highlights of red and yellow, another drop, and it grows larger and more enchanting, the spirals of antagonistic colours form a crescendo of light against the white blankness of paper.Its just a drop of paint, a miniscule drop in the subdued night-light,that Ishaan stares at,enraptured into a trance.His eyes glow bright and in that instant you realize that this is what makes this film so special.This film holds forth the enchanting beauty of the world around us, seen best through the eyes of a child.Ishaan is a dyslexic child, but this in no way a film about dyslexia or for that matter any disability.Ishaan is just any other child,the child in all of us.He is naughty, he is arrogant and he is desperately in need of recognition.Like the way he recognizes the beauty in a drop of paint,Ram Nikumbh, his art teacher sees in him his own past,sees in him the potential for greatness.Having gone through the pangs of separation and utter disregard,Ishaan loses this spark and its up to Nikumbh to discover it for him and make him overcome his troubles.The heartfelt emotions of Ishaan moisten the eyes of even the hardiest of viewers.The audience will cry not because this is a sad movie(which it is not),they will do so because the emotions are portrayed with such utter honesty and childlike simplicity. There is no embellishment of the script.This movie is spontaneously slow.All the emotions of Ishaan are polarized in that simple flip-book,where he finds himself slowly shifted out of frame from the picture of his idyllic family.At one point, when made to face his parents,Ishaan runs away, not into the sunset, but hysterically in circles around the school playground, giving vent to all his emotions.The sheer pain in his shining eyes grabs you by the heart.The film is so entirely honest and involving that you don't even realize until Aamir Khan finally turns up,that you have come to see the movie to watch him.All moralist films with a message end up doing so with philosophical contractions and mighty story lines.This film does so by a simple childlike ""Yes or No"" and no presumptuous ""Let me see""'s.No amount of accolades is enough for this film.Be it Aamir's simplicity in direction,his deliberately subdued acting style,Amole Gupte's script,SEL's ""different"" original score and last but not least the awe-inspiring performance by the ""Taare"" of the film-Darsheel Safari.Every child is special in an unique way.In an age when parents are churning out ""assembly line products"" ,""toppers,rankers""... there is little space for those who fall behind-the ""duffer""s.This movie simply tells society to stand up and recognize the simplicity in a child and the overwhelming potential each and every child possesses,be it a dyslexic child or otherwise.For all children are truly shining ""Taare"" in this darkness of ""Zameen"".It is up to each and every one of us to nurture this star around, and more importantly, within us."
"Like Stars On earth is a very inspiring movie. It is about Ishaan Nandkishore Awasthi (Darsheel Safary) is an eight-year-old boy who dislikes school and fails every test or exam. He finds all subjects difficult, and is belittled by his teachers and classmates. But Ishaan's internal world is rich with wonders that he is unable to convey to others, magical lands filled with colour and animated animals. He is an artist whose talent is unrecognised.Ishaan's father, Nandkishore Awasthi (Vipin Sharma), is a successful executive who expects his children to excel. His mother, housewife Maya Awasthi (Tisca Chopra), is frustrated by her inability to educate her son. Ishaan's elder brother, Yohaan (Sachet Engineer), is an exemplary scholar and athlete, which Ishaan is frequently reminded of.After receiving a particularly poor academic report, Ishaan's parents send him to a boarding school. There he sinks into a state of fear and depression, despite being befriended by Rajan (Tanay Chheda), physically disabled and one of the top students in his class. Ishaan's situation changes when a new art teacher, Ram Shankar Nikumbh (Aamir Khan), joins the school's faculty. An instructor at the Tulips School for young children with developmental disabilities, Nikumbh's teaching style is markedly different from that of his strict predecessor, and he quickly observes that Ishaan is unhappy and contributes little to class activities. He reviews Ishaan's work and concludes that his academic shortcomings are indicative of dyslexia. On his day off, Nikumbh visits Ishaan's parents and asks if he can see more of their son's work. He is stunned by the sophistication of one of Ishaan's paintings, and tells his parents that Ishaan is a bright child who processes information differently from other children in his class, but Ishaan's father is suspicious that the explanation is simply an excuse for his son's poor performance. Nikumbh demands that he read some Japanese text on a box and berates him when he cannot, giving him a glimpse into Ishaan's experience of school. Nikumbh describes dyslexia to them and explains that it is not a sign of low intelligence. He tells them he can provide extra tutoring that will help Ishaan, highlighting the boy's artistic ability evident in his many paintings and other creative works.Nikumbh subsequently brings up the topic of dyslexia in class, and offers a list of famous people who were dyslexic. As the students are leaving the classroom, Nikumbh asks Ishaan to remain behind and reveals to him that he too experienced the same difficulties with dyslexia. Nikumbh then visits the school's principal and obtains his permission to become Ishaan's tutor. He attempts to improve Ishaan's reading and writing by using remedial techniques developed by dyslexia specialists; Ishaan soon develops an interest in language and mathematics, and his grades improve.Towards the end of the school year Nikumbh organises an art fair for the staff and students. The competition is judged by artist Lalita Lajmi. Ishaan, with his strikingly creative style, is declared the winner and Nikumbh, who paints Ishaan's portrait, the runner-up. The principal announces that Nikumbh has been hired as the school's permanent art teacher. When Ishaan's parents meet his teachers on the last day of school they are left speechless by the transformation they see in him. Overcome with emotion, Ishaan's father thanks Nikumbh. As Ishaan is getting into the car to leave with his parents for summer vacations, he turns around and runs toward Nikumbh. The film ends with a freeze frame shot of Nikumbh tossing Ishaan into the air."
"Really heart touching story of Ishant Awasthi, a boy possibly suffering with dyslexia and problems he face as his parents and teachers are not able to understand him. His journey to boarding school where he is send because his parents think this would help. There he finds his art teacher Ram Shankar Nikumbh (Aamir Khan) who helps him find himself. He realizes his problems with learning words and his interest in art as he himself had dyslexia in his childhood. This seems a very serious kind of subject and movie makes you think about but is presented in a very interesting and fascinating way and will keep the grip of your attention all the time."
"Taara Zameen Par is one of the best movie in long time coming from India.Entire team has done a marvellous effort.It makes you smile, cry and touches you deep inside and make you feel if we are really listening to our children. A marvellous Movie, truly a master piece of our generation. Aamir Khan has once against proofed why he is the best This time not only as a actor, but as a producer and Director. He has done a marvellous job as a actor and tremendous job as a Director. As without his proper direction we would have to being able to see Darsheel daftary super performance. Script of the movie by amol gupte was brilliant. All the artist have performed well.Songs were brilliant specially Mera Jahan, Maa, Title track, Jame raho, Bheja Kum and who can forget Bam Bole. Aamir was looking very sexy in this song.In all a wonderful experience which will melt even the hardest person.Go for it."
"Initially, when I came to know that Aamir's next film is based on children's, I was a bit disappointed since children's movies are not appreciated in India and neither does they run at box office. And later when I read that Aamir is directing it, I was completely shocked and thought this is not a right step from Aamir Khan.But when I saw the movie, I realized how wrong I was. After watching this movie I should say that Aamir Khan should have taken director's seat few year's back since Bollywood lack's good director's and fine story teller's.Taare Zameen Par is definitely the great film of 2007. I have watched the movie trice on a same day in order to find some flaws in the movie, but didn't find any but on other hand the movie was more interesting the third time when compared to first time. This is the magic of the movie.Amol Gupte has written a powerful script and full justice has been done to the script by débutant director Aamir Khan. I think a lot of research on children's has been done by Aamir Khan and Amol Gupte before making the film which you find rarely in Bollywood film maker's these days.Thank you Aamir Khan Production's Private Limited for producing such a great film and keep going. You guy's really rock."
"Sure to touch your heart. Not even a single scene is out of place. Songs are beautifully written (watch out for ""Maa"" - You are bound to have moist eyes), even the rap song makes sense...Can you imagine Aamir khan being absent in the whole 1st half of the movie. And i never felt his absence...Darsheel excels and couldn't have been better. Aamir khan, as usually delivers the best. Somehow i felt the kid's father's character could have been moderated a bit but it never impacted the flow and storyline. Kudos to Aamir for taking up such a concept and making such a beautiful movie. I can wait for 2 more years for such a quality movie. Must watch movie."
"MY REVIEW -After an Average Fanaa,Great RDB i was in a hungry to see next Aamir movie. as we know Aamir do less movies in one year i had to wait almost like 1 and half year to watch his Next Movie called TZP.. being an Die hard Aamir Fan we had that experience since Lagaan days.. I kinda get angry at Aamir sometimes because of his huge releasing gap and doing less movies. But TZP destroy my all minus, angry feelings about Aamir and it made me a PROUD Aamir fan. :) Now i can even wait more 4 years to see an Aamir movie if he makes more Classic movies like TZP.OK some peoples might not believe it but this is my first Aamir movie in a theater ever, and woo-ow what a Great DAY it was. Speaical NOTE - I'm not very good at giving reviews so be patient :) Thanks.STORY -Everyone knows the story it is about Dylexia, and an Art teacher trying to Help a kid who suffering from dyslexia while his parents, rest peoples Trashin him.ABOUT THE MOVIE -What Aamir said in interviews was dam true. ""In my opinion it is THE most important film on children to come out of India."" Simply it is The Best movie on children in Bollywood ever IMO. it's really change how u look at the children's. If i become a father someday i will try ma best to caring ma kids properly. That's the Meassege what i got from the movie. That's what Aamir, the writer trying to give to peoples. BEST Scenes -# All Scenes between Darsheel ( the kid ) and parents# When Darsheel Start to read the book in the class ( ah-aha everyone in the theater laughed ) # Darsheel's Entry to Boarding School & MAA song.. ( i cried ) # Aamir's Entry, Aamir and Darsheel's First Meet# When mother looking at Darsheel's Art books# The scenes in Taare Zameen par title song ( Amazing )# When Aamir meets Ishaan's parents ( A Classic scene ) # When father comes to meet Aamir at the school & The Conversation between Aamir and father ( BRILLIANT ) # All scenes in Art MELA# The ClimaxActually almost every single scene was too Emotional, Touching simply Amazing. As a Director Aamir have done an Awesome job. he made that Kid act, his camera angels, the way camera moves really great.. Directing and Acting in a movie together isn't that easy thing. Only few peoples in Bolly did that, Few Succeeded. I gotta say Aamir is the BEST Actor Turn director in Bolly. If anyone think i'm being biased please go watch the movie and decide yourself. HATS OFF To Aamir for making an OUTSTANDING Movie like this. MUSIC - Amazing. it suits very well to the movie. MAA, TZP title songs are very touching. Mera Jaahan was very good.. a good energy song. Bum Bole an Great Entertaining song. Khoolo Khoolo is AWESOME. rest were alrightDIRECTING - One WORD TOP NOTCH PERFORMANCES - What can i say about performances ? Almost everyone was PERFECT in it. only the English teacher didn't seems very comfortable when he jokes, but that was nothing.. just nothing.. It is Ture The Movie Belongs to the KID Darsheel. What a Great Talent. HATS OFF To Aamir again for finding such an Amazing talented kid like him. His facial expressions, body language everything was just GREAT. He make u laugh in first 40 minutes and he will make u Cry in Rest. He deserve a Special Award for this Mindblowing performance. He was just brilliant in every single scene. Rate - 5 / 5 Now comes to the ACE Aamir as always he gives his best. When he talks to kid's parents his facial expressions was just PERFECT. i don't have words to describe how good he was. same as the kid make u cry Aamir make u cry whenever he enter..

Ratting - 5 / 5"
"Aamir has proved with this movie, what a perfectionist he is. This movies is a classic example of what an ""uncompromising movie making"" is all about.I walked into the theater with my 8 family members and very high expectations and after three hours, we all were entertained to the very core. In the last scene, all 8 /9 of us were crying, and believe me it was in the sparkle in the eye but it was big tears. About the content, movie has an excellent story line, great performances, fantastic music and neat direction. Only thing which has some room for improvement is the length of the movie. Editing could have been a much better especially the fist 70 % of the movie. There were quiet a few scenes, situations, emotions which are repeated more than twice. But this, does not in any way take away , what this movie has achieved.Not to mention, The subject of the movies is as relevant as anything else.KUDOS TO THE MAKER ON PRODUCING THIS GEM !!!"
"This film should be watched by all esp parents of young children.The script is fantastic and also performed well by the two leading roles(Amir and Darsheel)The highlight of this film is that it doesn't preach a lot.It makes us, feel the emotions of the child with a learning problem(dyslexia)The film opens with a superb scene and most of the scenes in the first half are entertaining.It is in the second half that the message is really addressed thru Amir's character. It is one of those few films that can make a difference in the lives of people.The only irritating performance is that of the child's father else, the overall performance by the main characters is praise worthy.some songs are really slowing down the film. Using animations to evoke a child's feelings has worked out well.Finally, some may shed a tear and some may laugh,but none can ignore the film and its issues.It will be nice of it is included in the curriculum of the schools."
