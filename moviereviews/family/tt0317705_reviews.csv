"Shortly after Dreamworks screwed up with the uninspired ""Shark Tale"", Pixar contains its remarkably success story with ""The Incredibles"". And while I have to say that I liked ""Finding Nemo"" a bit better, ""The Incredibles"" is still an amazing movie.First of all, this is because it's funny. It's not so funny that you're constantly laughing out loud, but there are more than enough good jokes in the movie to keep you entertained, and it's full of good observations about superhero movies (note all the ridiculous superhero and villain names) and references to other movies. It's also a brilliant James Bond spoof/homage, containing all the gadgets, secret island bases and crazy schemes that made early Bond movies so much fun.Secondly, this movie has heart and charm in droves. It's full of memorably and likable characters you can really identify with and care about. Characters like Edna are instant classics. The voice acting is universally excellent, but Holly Hunter steals the show as Elastigirl. This is a movie that doesn't need toilet humor, characters modeled like celebrities, or a ""hip"" soundtrack...it easily succeeds on charm and style alone.Also, I found it to be a surprisingly good action movie. The plentiful action sequences are full of energy, extremely fast-paced, and exciting, and put many a live-action movie to shame.Finally, I also liked the tone and message of the movie. ""The Incredibles"" basically makes a plea against mediocrity, breaking with the politically correct idea that ""everybody is special"" (and thus nobody really is), and encouraging people to use the talents they have been given. I think this couldn't be more true. Not all people are equally talented (just compare Pixar to Dreamworks), but this is no reason to keep the talented people from not reaching their full potential just because it makes the less talented ones feel bad.""The Incredibles"", while maybe not as hilarious as I had hoped (though it's still very funny), is nonetheless an extremely entertaining movie, that manages to charm you wit its combination of great characters, lots of style, tongue-in-cheek attitude and good message. Highly recommended.****1/2 of ***** stars"
"WOW! What a movie. I can honestly say this is in my top ten movies of all time, how do Pixar continue to out do themselves at every movie release?The Incredibles is a fantastic story, wonderfully scripted and with the most stunning animation you have ever seen, it provides a perfectly rounded story with plenty of action, laughs and (almost) tears.Basically, this is a story of a man encountering a mid life crisis and leaping headlong into it without a care or a thought for his family, proving exceedingly selfish and failing to see the good in his life. Meanwhile the wife is left to try and look after the family. Really, that's the story. Now, what Pixar have done is drop in the idea that the parents are Superheroes, banned from being Super many years previously by the Government and the people, trying to live a normal life. Add to the mix that some of their children have inherited their own powers and that the Super villains are planning a comeback, and you have this wonderful movie.I can't begin to convey how wonderful the animation is, it's perfect. I mean you'll always be looking at it knowing it's animation, but when the story takes you along you'll suddenly realize you're still watching animation. The subtle difference is that you forget, and there are parts (for instance when the father is cheering his son during the race) that you actually think it is real. The effects for water, fire (two of the hardest things to recreate in animation) and lava are wonderful to watch and caught me drawing a breath when I first saw them.The characters and acting are wonderful, and you will find yourself caring about them as real people. At some points I could feel a big swallow coming up and a wavering adams apple, obviously due to the food earlier, nothing to do with the movie.I often find that movies aren't paced well, that they either have too long or too short an introduction to the characters, or the events that lead up to the pivotal point of the movie are unbalanced against the climax, all sorts of combinations. Not here, this move is perfect and well balanced, the story takes you along just when you are ready, and there were no points where I wished we could move on, or something could happen quicker. My only frustration were at the kids, and this was only because they were behaving exactly as real kids would.It was interesting to see the comparisons and links to other famous Superheroes through comic-lore. Definitely with nods to The Fantastic Four, Silver Surfer and huge nods to The Watchmen. My only concern is that there is so much similarity to The Watchmen that those who haven't read the graphic novel will be saying ""That's the Incredibles movie"" when Watchmen finally comes to fruition.The short film showing before this was wonderful in itself, and had the audience laughing out loud loads. Excellent, and once again, outdoes every short that they've produced before. Boundin' was beautifully animated and wonderfully told. Guaranteed to bring a huge big smile to your face.All in all I think this movie is perfect and truly incredible."
"Writer-director Brad Bird here has something that I was caught off-guard by just a bit. I always expect Pixar films to be above-par, family entertainment, the kinds of films that can have an appeal to adults on a satirical, jab-in-the-side effect by having the characters reacting to each other as they would on a film with a higher rating, whilst giving the bright colors, action, and silliness that appeals to kids. Watching The Incredibles, their sixth feature-length offering, I wasn't so entertained and amused since their 98 film A Bug's Life, and it almost brought me back to the emotional impact I felt when in the theater for the first time getting Toy Story into my system. It's a film that takes on a type in society that we all know well (in the past they've done toys, bugs, monsters, undersea life, and now comic book archetypes) and transforms it superbly to the imaginative computer-animated landscape. This is also in credit due to Brad Bird, who proved five years ago with his sleeper The Iron Giant that he could transcend the genre and appeal with heart and vigor for almost every age bracket.So what little touches make The Incredibles so appealing? How it starts to deconstruct the idea of a superhero, perhaps, as well as how the family unit is shown in the usual conventions under unusual and funny circumstances. As an example, one of our heroes Mr. Incredible, a.k.a. Bob Parr (voiced wonderfully by Craig T. Nelson), goes to visit a woman who fixes and creates the uniforms of superheroes. In one scene she explains why a cape is not a good idea. This is the kind of scene that might not make it into most Hollywood movies, and would sometimes if not often be discredited as being too 'smart' for kids to get. But by appealing to a kind of level late teens and adults can relate to, it reaches a higher, far more intelligent plane. In fact, many of the best scenes in the film take on what we all know in films displaying the 'family unit' and morph it with the power and imagination of superheroes.I won't go too much into the plot as some may already have, except to say that what makes the story in and of itself appealing is how it is a fully formed story, and doesn't try and sell itself short like other animated films (i.e. Sharktale for example). It also uses it's PG-rating perimeter wisely, and Bird and company create action sequences that are as exciting, if not more so, than in the action films that have been released this year (in fact, some of the scenes in the climax, for my money, could rival a couple of those in Spider-Man 2). By setting up the right emotional bases with the characters- Bob, his wife Elasti-girl (Holly Hunter), their kids, and with supporting characters voiced finitely by the likes of Samuel L. Jackson and Jason Lee, by the time the high-charged, internally fantasy scenes take off, they take off with great conviction and excitement.Overall, The Incredibles is a film that is, in a way, what audiences wish they could get and rarely do- it's a film with wit and observance, a kind of video-game where the results are not as expectable as can be. Some kids may not get it as much as adults might, which is just as well, as it sometimes operates on a level like Antz did, only through the sphere of Disney. In other words, if you say the teaser trailer, which involved the out-of-shape Mr. Incredible trying with all his might to buckle his tights, you'll know what the film could bring. Personally, I can't wait to see it again."
"I hope that this movie does really well because this has to be one of the best animated movies I have ever seen. The story is really cool and it's obvious that there is a lot of respect here for the source of superheroes, whether it be comic books, serial flicks or Saturday morning cartoons.The movie has an undeniably cool retro feel to it and it shows not only in the design of the picture but also in the music, which definitely sounds like something out of a 60's 007 flick. It is also unusually dark, especially for a Pixar flick. I'm not saying it's dark where people are getting their heads delivered to someone in a box or family members are sleeping with each other or anything like that but there were moments where I found myself wondering if a little kid might be able to deal with the intensity of what was going on on screen. Maybe it was the fact that the heroes were in very real danger most of the time. The bad guys weren't out to catch them as much as they were out to kill them. When you discover who the film's villain is, you can literally feel his anger coming off the screen. I may be over-exaggerating a bit but then again, it really is to the film's credit that it deals with human emotions in the way that it does.Even though you are watching a film that is populated by CGI characters, the emotions they convey in what they say and do come across as purely believable. Whether watching Bob Parr interact with people at his job or just sitting at his desk was something that rang true to me, just in the feeling of it. Everything about this movie has a very concrete feel to it, even while looking like something you'd see in a comic book. The computer graphics in general were absolutely amazing and the voice acting is excellent across the board, so good in fact, that I really can't pick a favorite from the entire cast. I have to say that Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter were very good as Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl respectively. They had a moment near the end of the film that actually touched me but you can see that for yourselves. Samuel L. Jackson was hilarious and thankfully, he wasn't overused. Dash and Violet were realized so well that every time they came up on screen, I loved every minute of it. Dash, in particular was one of the funniest characters in the movie. Jason Lee made for a formidable villain as Syndrome. I loved the fact that he was your typical antagonist but was also aware of the conventions surrounding such a role, like when he chides himself for 'monologuing'. He was also one ruthless bastard, I'll give him that. Even the bit part characters were hilarious. There was a kid on a tricycle in this movie who comes out twice and made me laugh out loud both times. In fact, this movie reminds me of why I like Finding Nemo over Monsters, Inc. In Finding Nemo, not only are the main characters great but every other character they run into makes some kind of impression on you. Remember all the characters that Marlin and Dory ran into on their adventures together? Of course you do. Whether it was that crazy pelican with the Australian accent, Willem Dafoe as Gill, leader of the fishtank crew, or Bruce the Shark, you remember them after all is said and done and it makes the viewing experience that much richer. That's exactly how The Incredibles is. Every character that appears will make you laugh or intrigue you in some way. I have to admit that I was laughing myself throughout the entire movie, especially with the character of Edna Mode who almost steals the movie. Man, even the end credits are awesome! I have to give the director Brad Bird a big thumbs up for this one. He pulled it off and hopefully this will attract attention to his other animated film, ""The Iron Giant"", which was sadly overlooked when it was released and is also a really great film.All in all, I can't recommend this movie enough. I left very satisfied and felt no need to compare this to the rest of Pixar's movies. This one is just as good if not better than any other animated movie released this year and rightfully deserves its place among the best animated movies of all time.RATING: ***** out of *****."
"The Incredibles is a great film, and probably my favourite Pixar picture (Toy Story is the best, but that's different to favourite). It takes a while to properly get into the action, but when it does, it delivers it in spades.And that's exactly it. I would actually call The Incredibles an animated action film, because to be honest, I don't think there was enough comedy to call it an animated action comedy film. There are quite a few funny moments, but the gags don't come as fast as Finding Nemo or Toy Story.That being said, it does have truly amazing action set-pieces, brilliant voice acting, a fabulous script, wonderful characters and the animation is simply.....well....incredible.The music is definitely a stand-out. It actually made me smile, with it's jazzy tones and James Bond type scores.One of the greatest things about The Incredibles is that it's not a kiddies film; it's completely different to all the other Pixar films. They bring out tommy guns in the second scene, for crying out loud! If you want to see a more adult animated film, then go see The Incredibles, and enjoy every minute. But I wouldn't bring someone younger than 4 maybe, because it isn't really aimed at them, and they probably would find it quite scary.This is a great film, one of the best of 2004 in my opinion. If it just had a slightly higher gag rate, than this would be an absolutely perfect picture.9/10"
"This is one of the finest animated films I have ever seen. Not only is it a fine animated film, it is a great film period. The film obviously takes its cue from several real life super hero comic books, especially The Fantastic Four and the Justice Society of America. The Fantastic Four comparison is obvious due to the fact that Elatigirl and Violet were obviously inspired by Mr. Fantastic (aka. Reed Richards) and the Invisible Woman (aka. Sue Storm Richards) respectively. The J.S.A. influence is a little more obscure. Several years ago, DC Comics issued a mini-series that attempted to explain the demise of the Justice Society by claiming that the group was forced to disband after their loyalty to America was questioned during the 1950's. In this film, all the heroes were forced into hiding after the government refused to pay for wrongful legal claims brought against the super heroes of this film. Also, there are many in jokes that the casual viewer might not get, but that made it enjoyable for comic book fans. This the island scenes look as if they could have been inspired by many of the series produced by Gerry Anderson of the 1960's (eg. the Thunderbirds and Captain Scarlet).Another thing that made this film unique was its look. If you notice, the city where the story takes place looks like a fairly modern metropolis. However, if you look at the cars in the film, most of them look as if they would have been more at home in the mid to late 1960's. Also, the way that many of the characters were dressed also could have put them in that time.However, the thing that I really loved about this film was the fact that even though it was geared primarily to children, it was dark enough in theme to appeal to adults. In fact, there are a couple of scenes that you wouldn't normally associate with a film geared towards children.This film is definitely a classic of animation and once again Pixar shows why they are the masters of computer animation."
"I finally saw Pixar/Disney's ""The Incredibles"" after several scheduling glitches. Writer and Director Brad Bird's ""The Incredibles"" is truly incredible. It is one of the best movies of the year. The CGI animation is both cutting edge and simply stunning, and like all Pixar projects it has a solid story as it's foundation. Bird uses the Superhero mythology to tell a funny and poignant story: that when we forfeit or withhold our greatness, we are not being true to ourselves, and more importantly it is a disservice to those around us. As the story begins, Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) was the superhero's Superhero. As voiced by Nelson, Mr. Incredible, is very confident, on the verge of cocky. He uses his super strength and powers for good. He marries super, Elasticgirl (Holly Hunter). However, Mr. Incredible soon falls victim like his fellow ""Supers"" to the plight of our litigious society-- the people they save are suing them. Instead of getting malpractice insurance (which would have been a different movie), the persecuted... and prosecuted Supers assume their secret identities in a covert government relocation program. They also promise never to use their powers again even for good.We catch up 15 years later with Mr. Incredible, now just Bob Parr, insurance claim adjuster. He is suffering. His wife Helen, the former Elasticgirl, is busy getting settled in their new home with their kids, Violet (Sarah Vowell), Dash (Spencer Fox), and little Jack Jack. Violet and Dash have super powers, and Jack Jack is not yet toilet trained. Bob is totally frustrated by his job, and really the lie he is forced to live. Every week he and fellow Super, Lucius Best aka Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson), on their ""bowling"" night, listen to the police radio band so that they can save people in danger. Mild mannered life is killing Bob. He tells Helen regarding Dash's 4th grade graduation, that they keep ""creating new ways to celebrate mediocrity"".One day Bob is contacted by the mysterious, Mirage (Elizabeth Pena), enlisting his super powers for an undisclosed benefactor. Bob, still super strong, no longer has the six pack abdominals. He proceeds to train and trim the waistline. He sees his suit designer, Edna 'E' Mode (Brad Bird), to fix his super suit. In a hilarious exchange, E enrolls Mr. Incredible in a new suit, sans cape. It is disclosed that the benefactor is villain, Syndrome (Jason Lee). Turns out that Mr. Incredible was the one responsible for Syndrome's genesis when he invalidated the young Syndrome 15 years ago. Thus, we have the classic Superhero tale of conflict and revenge.What also distinguishes ""The Incredibles"" along with the story about reclaiming greatness, is that it is about family. In a very touching scene when Mr. Incredible is about to do battle with the seemingly invincible Omnidroid, he admits to Helen ""...I'm not strong enough..."" Having super powers is great. Having the love of family is truly powerful. Craig T. Nelson is perfect as Mr. Incredible. He is bold, funny, and endearingly vulnerable. Holly Hunter is solid and folksy as Helen, who also projects a quiet power. Jason Lee is at his annoying best as Syndrome. Brad Bird as 'E' steals every scene that she is in. Director Brad Bird's ""The Incredibles"" is amazing to look at, and also has something special and touching to say."
"I am tired of reading reviews about how an animated film is too violent for children, deals with mature issues like segregation or death, or is simply ""too grown up"" for small children. Since when did we decide to water down the truth for children, and when exactly are they old enough for certain issues, and why is it animation means it's suppose to be for children. Animation has allowed movie makers to break molds, has allowed them to do things that could not be done with regular actors or locations. We use CGI to accomplish effects we otherwise couldn't do, why is the art of illustration not considered on the same level as the art of computer graphics? I don't feel that just because something is made for children it should be dumbed down and I don't believe that an adult is too superior to watching something that is animated. Stories geared toward children such as Aesop's Fables or the fairy tales of the brothers Grimm, and Hans Christian Anderson, were told to teach life lessons; don't cry wolf, be happy with what you have and don't trust strangers. These are lessons, and stories, that were not watered down, that showed to what evil depths greed, slothfulness and envy, just to name a few, could take hold of in a person.The Incredibles does not shy away from being real; it has an amazing message for both adults and children. The message I saw over and over again in the movie but could not find in a single review was how society was oppressing people to be no better than someone else. We seem to be headed towards embracing mediocrity, Harrison Bergeron, the short story by Kurt Vonnegut that was later turned into a film with Sean Astin, is the perfect example of someone smart being held back because it would hurt the dumb kids feelings to know there was someone better than them. The Incredible's attacks this head on, in one scene the villain Syndrome (voiced by Jason Lee), who has no real super powers but invents rocket shoes and remote controlled robots, tells Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) that he plans on killing all the truly empowered people and, using his inventions, become the only super hero until he's had his fun, at which time he will sell his inventions allowing everyone to become special ""which of course means no one will be"".Mr. Incredible and his wife, Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), have three children. Daughter Violet (Sarah Vowell) can make herself invisible but only uses it to hide from a boy she likes, she's been broken down in spirit to feel like there is something horribly wrong with her and that she should be ashamed for being empowered with this amazing gift, to her it is a curse. Violet's younger brother Dash (Spencer Fox) on the other hand is angry with not being allowed to play in sports, because of his super speed, even though he promises not to show off. Their character development is some of the most in depth I've seen for ""children"" in a film, in part because it's real, they face death and failure and they rise above their shame and anger to become real heroes.This movie is funny, it was honest, and it was one of the best films of the year. There is real development, there are real issues and real messages and at the end of the film I wanted to find the super hero in myself. I don't see why we should deny younger people, our children, the right to see something that is so beautiful just because of its honesty."
"This was somewhat of a surprise hit when it came out in 2004. Most of the attention was on a competing animated film but this is the one that turned out to be a huge box-office success. Word of mouth helped his immensely. It's what made me check it out, as several friends recommended it. I wound up agreeing with them: it's excellent entertainment.The visuals and sound are very impressive, but it's the story that carries this film: a solid combination of humor, drama, suspense, family ties and action. The action, as in many modern-day films, was overdone in the last half hour of the movie but overall....the DVD is a good investment since people 3 to 63 should enjoy this.As an adult, it's not always easy to keep my attention for two hours with animation but the fact this movie does, tells you how good the story is presented. There are wonderful colors in here, too, and a good 5.1 surround system with a sub-woofer would probably blow the roof off!"
"Wow. This isn't just the best animated movie I've seen in a long time; it's one of the best movies, period. For sheer giddy enjoyment, stunning visuals, engaging characters. When the industry makes films with this much action and special-effects wizardry and a couple of big-name faces up front, they generally don't spend money on niceties like writing and character development. But Pixar, since they have something to prove with their computer-generated actors, has done the hard and loving work to infuse these cartoon characters with a humanity that most big-budget live-action movies don't match. Go see this one. Go see it for:Visuals. There is a reality to this picture that hasn't been present in previous feature-length CG movies. Hair, foliage, rust, water-all are executed very convincingly. You know these characters aren't human beings, but it's hard to believe that they aren't somehow real.Acting. The voice work is excellent, particularly Holly Hunter and Craig T. Nelson. The animators have done a great job capturing the subtleties of those performances in the motions of the on-screen avatars. If you saw the ill-fated Final Fantasy movie (of technical interest only, not really for the general public)-these cartoonish characters don't look as real, but they seem much more human.Bond References. There is an secret lair in this movie the likes of which Dr. No and Blofeld could only dream. Every Bond homage is pitch perfect, and we found ourselves laughing in an otherwise quiet theatre at the wonderful invention of the production design. Hey, we're movie geeks; apparently the others weren't. This movie is worth ten bucks for the modern architecture alone.Edna Mode. This character is the manic love child of 007's ""Q"" and Edith Head, and will surely be remembered as one of the great animated characters. She is voiced by the director, Brad Bird.I know I'm not exactly going our on a limb here; the Tomatometer shows 96% as of this writing. But I wanted to see this movie again as soon as I left the theatre.Notes: This one is for older kids and adults, as the PG rating indicates.There are no ""outtakes"" in the end credits. (Anti-spoiler?)"
"Pixar has again proved that it's ethics and capabilities are inexterminable even for the tough-willed Dreamworks, which are gradually attempting to catch up on with standards. But with Pixar's new title, we once more experience a great gratifying animation which deeps you inside by it's humorous and enthralling plot and keeps you laughing out loudly until the very end. Dreamworks' titles compared to Pixars are not too peculiar, but they seem to rip all their titles from Pixar and create a fake illusion of originality. Now that Pixar has created another chef-d'oeuvre, no doubt Dreamworks will once more rip the idea and create a title relating to superheroes. 9.5/10"
"Yes, I've seen this story a million times. I'm also not a very big fan of Disney and Pixar together, but this time they got me hooked. After fearing to rent this, many of my friends convinced me that I should take a look at it. So, I did and feel in love with it.The effects, I feel like today, there are way too many fancy computer effect movies. But it works with ""The Incredibles"" because that's half the humor with it. There are some very reconizable voices in there that you know very well.Is this just a kid's movie? No, it does contain some adult humor. I can see with parents taking their kids to the theater, it has to be somewhat enjoyable to adults too. So as a family or whether you have children or little relatives, I would recommend this movie for you guys. It is very enjoyable and fun to watch.10/10"
"Is it a bird, no it's a plane, no it's the IncrediblesImagine if one crazed scientist had a colossal sized blender and put the love and affection of The Modern Family in it, then sprinkled some dysfunctional madness of Malcolm in the Middle and then added superpowers to the mix, I guarantee that what comes out still won't be a match for the crazy, adorable, high octane and utter zaniness that are the Incredibles. The dad is supper strong, the mother can stretch like taffy, and the teenage girl can become invisible and throw up force fields and the 10 year old is lightening fast, which is quiet lucky when they must come up against the rich, genius of the villainous Syndrome, who seeks to destroy the hero he once worshipped in Mr. Incredible and an the whole city along with him. Despite the film being an animation featuring a story line that was extremely fantastical, not once did I remember it was a movie. The actions scenes were spell bounding and highly imaginative. But most importantly, I really believed in these characters that spat witty sharp dialogue at each other at a furious pace, not just because they were funny, but because the characters were so believable and relatable. Subsequently it should come as to no surprise that film was nominated for a best screenplay Oscar, which is a rarity for an animated film, but this ain't just your average animated film, it's an Incredible animated film"
"It's tough to be a superhero and not be allowed to manifest your prowess due to a lawsuit which has made you go into a ""superhero protection program"" and live the life of an Average Joe.This is the case of Bob Parr, Mr. Incredible as he is also known. Living in marital complacency in suburbia with his wife Helen, also known as Elastigirl and his three kids, he works as a mindless office drone who needs to support his family and occasionally gets together with his buddy Lucius Best/Frozone and tries to fight small crime.Until one day when he gets called on a special assignment in a remote location which leads him smack into the lair of a former fan, now turned arch-nemesis, Syndrome, who has an interest in destroying the world and also destroying his family.What could have been a by-the-numbers story is enhanced by much of the ""performances"", or rather, the way the characters are made to interact to one another as per the screenplay. Bob and Helen are clearly in love even though their glory years as superheros (they believe) are over. Bob frets that he's become this paunchy bear of a man, Helen now has to multi-task since she is raising three children, each with a personality of their own, each with superpowers of their own.I find it interesting to see how their kids also are given distinct personalities: Dash has the restless spark that his superpowers will require him to have and Violet is as close to channeling Lydia Dietz from Beetlejuice as possible -- shy, goth, and starting to develop her powers of invisibility and create force fields but beset by feelings of insecurity. Even Jack-Jack, the baby, has his moments, mainly caused by typical baby tantrums and in a crucial point, sheer fear. And this is where the script works: it never forgets that they are essentially kids who have these powers and would treat them as any kid would.Brad Bird has in his hands an excellent, humanized tale of superheroes that borrows liberally from the Fantastic Four and takes it into an Ozzie and Harriet setting. He's created a movie that is tricky: while animated, it has some elements that will not be understood or suitable for children, such as Bob Parr going through his identity crisis, for example. At the same time, this is the first time that a film has broken grounds in its background animation. While the people are seen as cartoons, the locations are something else and have the look and feel of actual scenery. It's the first time water looks like water; that made me almost feel like reach out and touching the screen.Much of the credit in establishing the characters are the voices used. Craig T. Nelson brings a beautiful masculinity to Bob Parr who would probably resemble bodybuilder Jeramy Freeman. Holly Hunter's voice makes Helen spunky, resourceful, feminist but devoted at the same time. Samuel L. Jackson brings his own star power into Lucius Best and the scenes involving his wife at a tense moment is side-splitting and cheerfully stereotypical. And what Bird himself does with his own rendition of Edith Head is nothing short of camp heaven.In short, excellent family entertainment with a smart spin on what becomes of superheros once their fifteen minutes of fame are over."
"""The Incredibles"" is by far and away the most mature and engaging Pixar film to date. This movie is nothing less than a display of sheer brilliance to an utmost prestigious level that proves the genius in director Brad Bird (""The Iron Giant""). From the perfectly created characters to the witty and humorous dialog involved, ""The Incredibles"" is the ideal film for true fans of the animation and/or comic book genre. It doesn't fail to provide viewers of with a fragment of every genre; incredible animation, action, and even a bit of drama. However, the aspect most evident in ""The Incredibles"" that was frequently credited for the success of its predecessors was the emotional aspect. The thesis on midlife crossroads on personal and professional dilemmas was well presented.Bob Parr (Craig T. Nelson) seems an average guy who works in an insurance agency, and lives a ""normal"" mediocre life with his wife Helen and three kids: Violet, Dash, and Jack-Jack. But there's more to it, actually. Bob used to be Mr. Incredible, and Helen was Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), two of the world's greatest crime fighters until a series of lawsuits have forced superheroes to adopt civilian identities. But when Bob receives a mysterious call that has him for a top secret assignment, he sees this as an opportunity to be Mr. Incredible again. He accepts the mission but soon discovers that it is a trap of a nemesis from way back, and the whole family eventually has to to join him to fight evil and save the world.What we have here is something that unfortunately becoming quite a rare thing nowadays: an example of a truly brilliant animation. As I have said, not only does it have some of the most phenomenal computer graphics and action sequences ever committed to film, but like all the best movies it also has the heart to support the movie between the adrenaline-pumping moments. The main reason for this is the great characterization. ""The Incredibles"" may contain a little too much of violence that may be better suited for older children than the younger ones. Yet one cannot easily discount the family themes and comic episodes, with characters like superhero-costume designer Edna (voiced by Bird) and Bob's friend Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) providing ample support. Another is that the film, as is with previous Pixar films, is effective in the use of computer generated images (CGI) which is a major plus for moviegoers. The details in which the animators for the film present are awe-inspiring and breathtaking. The music also pasted itself impeccably with the atmosphere Bird has created for the film. Very retro.It is a demonstration of precision and excellence, created by the brilliance and meticulous mannerisms of the director. It goes beyond an animated movie and is without a doubt one of the best animations of all time. It is truly incredible to see a film like this."
"This website has ranked this film to be one of the top 250 films ever made...You want to know something, I totally agree with this verdict!! This high definition surreal film by the master of animation...Walt Disney, evoked a successful culmination of cinematic brilliance on a myriad of artistic production levels!! An accomplishment like this epitomizes the term ""entertaining"" in it's most resounding form!! In evaluating the initial premise of this film, it compounds the dilemma of the proverbial glory days being a thing of the past!! A guy who was a football hero in his school days whereby it was routine to score four touchdowns in a game, and eventually, it fades due to a knee injury or being out of shape or something, this signifies that his best days are over!! When a former head cheerleader who was the starlight of every male's eye, who counted on her good looks, and she loses them, her best days are over as well!! So too is the case of a family of superheroes who leaped through buildings at a single bound in a vigilante crusade to capture nefarious criminals!! Ultimately, their vicarious damage to buildings and citizens meant that the municipality had to insulate itself from any further pecuniary culpability, and relocate them!! This would seemingly suggest that the Incredible's best days are behind them also!! As is the case with so many has beens, the end result winds up being a case of the breadwinner getting relegated to the monotonous plight of an inane job such as an insurance salesman. Such mediocrity reduces the Mr and Mrs to the state of being sedentary and overly mortgaged!! This movie depicts how even a family of manufactured stick people representing the world of fantasy, cannot hide from the afflictions of mid-life crises!!!! The ultimate undoing in these superhero's lives are the non-visceral elements of banality such as; indemnity forms, traffic jams and paranoid nightmares about deteriorating marital trust!! Just as someone wants to be a star football player,or a head cheerleader, all over again, these Incredibles wish to return to their exciting lives as the superheroes who took on capital crime!! Such a plot is very innovative, the writing in this dressed up doggerel of entertainment was remarkable!! This movie has a succinctly homogeneous blend of voices which induce an appropriately heinous cacophony of emotions which effectively illustrate exuberance and despair!! The sound effects were outstanding in this movie!! The cinematography in ""The Incredibles"" was superb!! Middle class hang-ups have been injected into teenage movies and television ever since ""The Simpsons"". This trademark of domestic rancor is for purposes of appealing to a broader audience range!! I found this film to be an ingenious use of satire, while mastering a digitalized analog of intelligent caricatures!! ""The Incredibles"" is not just a kid's film, or an overgrown adolescent's film, it is for everybody!! The family was called the Incredibles, the movie is called FANTASTIC!!"
"Although ""The Incredibles"" is not the best film Pixar has released (via Disney) since 1995's ""Toy Story,"" I felt it is the most epic. When I went to go see ""Toy Story"" in 1995, the epic scale of the picture -- the non-stop frantic pace, the action sequences, etc. -- were all so breathtaking that it contained the same tour de force attitude as, believe it or not, a blockbuster such as ""Terminator 2"": a crowd-pleasing, overwhelming picture.""Monsters, Inc."" wasn't quite as epic. It was a great movie, just as good as ""Toy Story,"" but it didn't have the same style per se. ""Finding Nemo"" was very good as well but still didn't capture the same epic scale as ""Toy Story."" (I'm not saying that's a bad thing, just different.) ""The Incredibles"" seemed to. I saw it on DVD and from beginning to end the action is non-stop, the laughs aplenty, and the exotic locations and action-hero references continuous. For this reason, somehow, it reminded me very much of ""Toy Story."" It seemed like older Pixar, rather than some of their newer stuff (all of which is great as well). Pixar has yet to make a bad movie. Even their worst -- ""A Bug's Life"" -- was better than most animated films.""The Incredibles"" also returns to the spoof roots of ""Monsters, Inc."" and ""Toy Story"" (something ""Finding Nemo"" did but not as often) -- it parodies cultural references. (Something hard to do in an underwater sea adventure.) Although this is a family film, it is NOT a ""children's film."" That is evident from the beginning when the fake news reel in ""The Incredibles"" features articles about a suicidal man suing superheroes because he ""didn't want to be saved."" This is clearly a tongue-in-cheek criticism of the shameless legal standards of the day. (Such as the woman who sued McDonald's because her coffee was too hot. A true story!) Another film might not be clever enough to integrate iconic cultural references into itself but ""The Incredibles"" does.Similarly, using superheroes, Pixar examines the at-home relationship of a family and spoofs our own rituals. (Such as eating at the dinner table -- the mom tries to stop the squabbling kids just like we do, only because she has superpowers, it's a bit... different.) All in all ""The Incredibles"" really is a great animated film. I enjoyed it more than ""Finding Nemo"" (which I didn't expect to as I loved ""Nemo"") and just as much as ""Toy Story"" and ""Monsters, Inc."" Pixar has solidified a new style of family film-making -- the cultural parody animated film -- and the evidence of this can be seen in such take-offs of the formula as ""Shrek"" and ""Shark Tale"" (which featured many cultural references as well).All in all ""The Incredibles"" is incredibly fun. And funny."
"'The Incredibles (2004)' is a masterclass in character, always putting its central family in front of its superb superhero action. That action is often somewhat counter-intuitively but cleverly conveyed using the tropes and language of the spy genre, giving the movie a decidedly 60s flavour in the process. The piece is a much more mature affair than you might expect, being a family film in every sense of the word - a movie suitable for kids as opposed to one made for them. It is nuanced, affecting and will actually pay off more for the older members of its audience. It plays like a live-action picture with the world's most convincing special effects, since they're rendered exactly like the rest of the flick, and some of the most convincing characters, too. What makes the film so fantastic is that it's genuinely entertaining all the way through. It's properly funny, intriguing, suspenseful, emotionally impactful and exciting, too. What's so impressive is that it easily rises to the top of its genre, standing amongst the best of its peers (and even, in itself, commenting on them), despite being released when that very same genre was still in its infancy. It stands tall as apparent 'kid' fare that's far more mature than most 'adult' - or, at least, 'teen' - stuff being produced even today (over ten years after its release). It's effortlessly enjoyable and wonderfully conceived. Really, it's just incredible. 8/10"
"In every review of *The Incredibles*, it has become a refrain: ""This movie could have worked as well in real life."" Big Bob Parr (voice of Craig T. Nelson) is a cone-shaped mountain of a guy, an ex-superhero doing time as a layperson in a world gone small  from his office cubicle to his aspirations. Married to superheroine, Elastigirl (voice of Holly Hunter), like every husband, he sneaks out at night occasionally to hang with the boys  in Bob's case, to fight crime as Mr. Incredible with his former teammate, Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson).Bob's two kids have inherited superpowers as well: son, Dash, super speed and daughter, Violet, telepathy and invisibility (think Phoenix from the X-Men). (A discussion on how the genetic combination of super-strength and elasticity in the parents would yield super-speed and invisibility in the offspring would get us nowhere.) This 3D-animation marvel is separated from its peers by its thematic thunder - sure, it gives us the usual ""familial values,"" but digs deeper by making the characters smart enough to ponder their roles as super beings in a mediocre world. The parents know that provincialism denotes they must keep their powers/identities hidden and their children sheltered, but the kids don't understand why, raising Socratic questions about herd mentality and the conundrum of being ""created equal"" yet more gifted. Mom tells Dash, ""Everyone's special"" (which is its own special form of condescension) and Dash, instead of taking it like a Disney knockout punch  as most kids in these ""family"" movies are inculcated to accept  retorts (quite logically), ""Which is another way of saying that nobody is."" And when the action comes, it delivers in ways that even some live-action superhero movies do not. And by this I mean, the whole group uses their powers efficiently and intelligently, working together to combat their threats, rather than getting taken down by some inane plot point which they could have easily escaped simply by being themselves.And of course, there is the mandatory Group Hero Pose, perfected so gaily by N'Sync during their two-month heyday. (Apologies to my more sensitive readers for using the ""N-word."") Jason Lee voices the villain, Syndrome, whom the family team must combat to Save The Day.Written and directed by Brad Bird (who does triple duty as Edna Mode, a fashion designer for the hero-conscious), the humor is wit, rather than slapstick, the heroism is moral rather than muscle-bound and the whole outlook is adult rather than kiddie - *The Incredibles* is as real a movie as a cartoon gets."
"The Incredibles is a simple and slightly formulaic comic book-style animated Disney/Pixar feature with a great big heart. I just experienced this film for the second time, and though I didn't really catch anything new, or achieve a different perspective, I was certainly as entertained as I was in the theater the first time.The Incredibles are the family of Mr. Incredible and Elasti-girl, living in a nightmare future where superheroes have been sued and regulated to the point that they are either forced underground or into protection programs complete with assumed identities and mediocre jobs. Mr. Incredible himself is invincibly physically strong, but emotionally drained by the uselessness of his new life as an insurance claim examiner, and his depression is so complete that he feels as if he is detaching from all that he loves. The children are ""Dash"" - a miniature Flash clone, ""Violet"" - who has all of the basics of Sue Richards, The Fantastic Four's Invisible Girl, and infant Jack Jack - about whom little can be said. Eventually, the entire family gets swept up into a crisis of vast proportion as a forgotten piece of Mr. Incredible's past comes back to threaten the very world which has rejected them all.The film really does derive a lot of its archetypal character points from Marvel's classic Fantastic Four, but adds brilliant humor, a very positive message, and some voice work which really is nothing less than Incredible. I was especially impressed by Sarah Vowell's Violet. The voice talent in general, however, is exceptionally good, and the supporting cast doesn't slip a centimeter. Brad Bird's Edna is also a memorable stand-out. Visually, the film is as good as any of the recent animated features most movie fans have enjoyed, though perhaps slightly less inventive and a bit less pretentious. I guess I would have to say that it's also my favorite, with Finding Nemo running a close second. This would be a great film to see with your kids. It's clean, fun, and yet serious enough to engage even the most angst-ridden teenager. It also contains some very positive messages about the value and meaning of heroism, family, and 'sticking together' through the worst and the best of times."
"Spoilers herein.All movies are about other movies. Most simply quote them, and most of these are bad. Some are very clever quoters, like Tarantino. But still mere quoters. A few weeks ago, I saw 'Van Helsing' which impressed the daylights out of me. It was all about transmutation at many levels including transmuting itself through several other movie identities.Meanwhile, I've been impressed by Pixar for other reasons. They've always been the leaders in folding and introspective dimensionality. Their logo even shows it: an illuminator jumps on the 'i', replaces it, looks around and then looks directly at you.In this film, their introspective experiments extend to quoting other films. But instead of the simple shopkeeping of Tarantino, we have appearances of other films but instead of being quoted they are re-imagined. Each transmutation is better than the original: This is better Bond than Bond, better Spy Kids than Spy Kids, better family drama than any recent experience. Better through-the-trees chase than Star Wars. Much, much better than 'Spiderman' and its ilk because it really understands pacing and manages ever-more unseen camera swoops.And it does everything it does with familiar images. For instance, the scene where Bob smacks his boss through several walls and he ends up wrapped in bandages and in traction is a collection of classic images from old cartoons, starting with the big guy grabbing the little guy. Except you don't notice that the big guy is the good guy. Never happens in the classics.There are two interesting folds here: the one that folds many movies genres as we mentioned and the one that conflates the folds of reality. Here's how this works: Usually there are two layers of a folded movie: the movie and some more abstract story within the movie. Spoofs depend on you knowing the layers, even if a layer isn't shown. So 'Austin Powers' has the intermediate level of Bond, even though it doesn't have an explicit segment that exists in the world of Bond. Ted's law says the folding distance must be equal, so the abstraction between the real world and that of Bond is exactly the same as that between Powers and Bond, extra cartoonishness if you wish.This Pixar project has two levels squashed into the same world. One level is the very realistically abstracted story between Bob and Helen. This isn't very cartoonish at all compared the regular world of cartoons. Then you have the superhero world which Bob and later Helen dive into; this is the most extremely abstract world of cartoons. Three levels, us, Bob and Helen as people (and they seem more real in this mode than most 'real' characters) and Bob and Helen and kids as superheros.The novelty of the fold is that these are squashed together as if there is no distance. That (plus some very human-like camera angles and the 'interview' footage at the beginning) squashes the world of the viewer into what we see. Its the kind of brilliant novelty that can only be done by close students of the art.A side comment that follows: the standard Disney cartoon has to have an obvious moral. Parents enthusiastically use this as a sad excuse for parenting. This film puts the moral in the spoof level. That means, folks, that it is equating it to the mediocre fictions Bob berates at the beginning. To distract the dopes in the audience, they do damage control by splicing an 'ordinary' moralistic dippy thing at the beginning.The real moral is that most movie houses have 'insurance:' they test their films into mediocrity. Pixar does no testing. They figure it out and trust their geniuses. Along the way, they take two heavy hits in the story at insurance companies who literally put superstars out of business, and incidentally steal from the worthy. Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"I cannot say enough about the cleverness of the writing and the animation of this film. Even the animated acting was better than many live action films. The story, about what happens to a group of superheros when the public turns against them and they are forced to go underground and be normal, and then a tricked back into action, is so well thought out that hardly a moment or a shot passes in which there is not some small brilliant detail that catches you off guard and amuses. Even the music is funny. When Mr. Incredible is creeping around the island fortress of the evil Sundrome the music is strikingly suggestive of the kind of tense themes John Barry would write for James Bond's infiltration of the island fortress in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE and many others. The Incredibles is particularly striking, I think, for those of us who grew up reading comic books regularly because it gives answers to fun questions like, where does a superhero go when he needs a new costume? I cannot recommend it enough for both kids and adults."
"The Incredibles is further proof Pixar focuses more on story and characters rather than in-jokes and celebrity voices, as in Dreamworks'features (not that there's anything wrong with that, just look at Shrek 1 AND 2). Okay, there are quite a lot of pop-culture references in this film, because of the story, but that doesn't stop The Incredibles from being an... incredible movie.For the first time in a Pixar film, the main characters are human: Bob Parr (Craig T. Nelson) used to be a great superhero, Mr.Incredible, until such activities became illegal (fans of Alan Moore may find that concept familiar). Now he has to deal with a boring job and his family: wife Helen (Holly Hunter), aka Elastigirl, and three kids, Dash (who's called Flash in the Italian version, guess why), Violet(who's got the same powers as Marvel's Invisible Woman) and baby Jack-Jack, who so far seems to be ""normal"". He's desperate to return to the old glorious days, not realizing his family is the ""greatest adventure ever"". And their help will be needed when a new threat shows up...The film's best element is the script, which teaches a valuable lesson (family matters more than anything) while providing some jaw-dropping action scenes (no wonder the movie got a PG rating) and various references to the genre (almost every existing superhero is poked at, as well as James Bond and Indiana Jones). The other awesome thing is of course the characters: the titular family is basically the ""super"" version of the Simpsons (Bob getting home from work is pure Homer), and two supporting characters deserve a special mention. One is Frozone, Mr.Incredible's buddy, the only one in the movie who's voiced by a real star (Samuel L. Jackson, who's a gas as usual). The most important one, though, is Edna Mode, who makes the supers' outfits. Wonderful and hilarious, she's one of the best animated characters in years (ironically enough, she's voiced by a man, the movie's writer/director, Brad Bird).For those who really love movies, The Incredibles is a must-see in the animated feature category. Don't miss it!"
"Saw this when I was 10 Years Old back in late 2004 & bloody loved it from the get go! So much so, me & my family seen it 3 times!! It was simply amazing!!The story-line is simply great & epic! It follows Bob Par as a super strength hero saving people lives among others including his wife, Elastagirl! They all get out lawed by the public who are too fickle & ungrateful to understand there goals in saving the world & protecting the innocent. So 15 years on we see Bob & his now family with Violet & Dash, both also born with powers living a normal life, but Bob simply can't get away from his hero lifestyle so he & his best mate Frozone secretly save lives & continue to fight crime, but a past fanboy, Syndrome wants vengeance from Mr. Incredible!The film was just epic in every aspect! It was dark, funny, raw & simply one of the best films Pixar have ever made! I even recall having a crush on Violet when I was younger after seeing this film! It really does remind me of my childhood & basically the older days back in the early 00's which was a great time to grow, especially when watching films like this one that never ever seem to get old or boring & can be watched over & over again!Overall this film gains a rare but strong & solid, 10/10!Classic film! Go watch it!"
"Just as its name suggests, It strikes its themes deep into our hearts, inspires us to be heroes and shows us why we need them. Simply put, the best super hero theatrical performance of all time. Loved it."
"Highly engaging animated comedy, The Incredibles is a highly amusing picture made by Pixar, and as you can imagine, this is a solid piece of work from the studio that constantly turn out great movies. This is a well crafted film, one that boasts a great story, a great cast of voice actors, and brilliant animation. This one of the finest films that Pixar has made and one of their most elaborate. This is a highly engaging picture, one that is sure to satisfy any viewer of every age group. The script is laced with great humorous bits, and there is a good mix of action and excitement throughout the film. This is a perfect film, one that just so much fun from start to finish and each actor chosen to voice their character are just wonderful. If you loved previous Pixar features, then you're sure to enjoy this one just as much. The Incredibles is one of the finest animated features that I've seen. There are plenty of things to enjoy here, and any genre fan will surely enjoy the film. The idea behind the film is wonderful and it is a well crafted picture and director Brad Bird delivers a stunning animated feature that is guaranteed to appeal to anyone looking for a fun and entertaining picture. If you love Pixar films, don't pass up on this film, it is a highly memorable affair, one of that is a lot of fun from start to finish. With great characters, well scripted dialogue and beautiful animation, this is a stunning piece of work from the studio, and is definitely a modern classic."
"This film for Pixar has to be one of their greatest achievements. Many of their movies revolve around animals who have feelings, but The Incredibles is a nice change of pace from that usual plot line. The Incredibles tells the story of the Parr family, a family of undercover superheroes, who try to fit in to suburban life after being told by the government they most go into hiding. Some of the superheroes wish the old days of crime fighting would return while some wish that they could be normal rather than just pretending to be. Stakes are raised as the film continues to show the stories of each character and how they react to the events that happen around them. The film has great characters that are more than two dimensional story conveyors. The writing is superb and will entertain adults just as much as it will kids. The Incredibles is a fresh breath of air brought to animated films by writer/director Brad Bird (The Iron Giant, Ratatouille). The story he made for the audience is one that is intricate and deep. It deserves to be remembered as one of the Pixar greats."
"For his directorial debut in the Pixar Studios, Brad Bird had an idea of genius.Indeed, ""The Incredibles"" is two things: a superhero movie genre with all the predictable archetypes and it's a commentary on the restraining uniformity of American suburban life. That ""super hero/ ordinary family"" contrast is the core of the film and the inspiration for its greatest moments. This achievement is even more remarkable given how familiar we are with these archetypes, yet they work in such a symbiosis that the set-ups are always predictable but not the outcomes, and the starting gimmick reveals itself a never-ending source of fun and entertainment.The identity of superheroes and their struggle to fit in the real life is an overused theme but because we're watching a family movie, the formula is totally reversed, ""The Incredibles"" is about a 'normal family' trying to keep their super-heroic background secret, the focus is on the normal identity, not the superheroes. The first scenes are misleading: Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) has an appointment yet finds the time to save a cat, stop a bank robber, and bag thief with the providential help of Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), he meets one of his friends, Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson), he prevents a man from suicide, he intercepts a French villain with the suave name of Bomb Voyage, and one of his fans, a wannabe sidekick named IncrediBoy (Jason Lee) to blew it with his intervention. What a night, but he finds the time to join the church and marry the woman of his life, Elastigirl  the tone is set, the whole super-heroic stunts were just the prelude to a beautiful family story.But these stunts weren't without consequences, two of them will be particularly dramatic. The suicidal man sues Incredible for having ruined his death rather than saved his life, starting a streak of successful lawsuits where heroes are condemned to pay indemnities for undesired interventions, hence becoming a liability to the Stage government. Finally, it's decided each of them to be relocated in a sort of witness protection-like program, with the order not to ever interfere, and live in anonymity. Superheroes all have weaknesses, Kryptonites, but no one can beat the bureaucracy. The enemy is normality. And this is a constant theme as the father Incredible, now Bob Parr, can't resuscitate the old past glory and is forced to work in a cubicle for a petty boss, Helen is a devoted housewife teaching her son not to run too fast, and fit in the crowd by not being special, not the super-heroic way. This contributes to one of the best quotes : ""everyone's special"" ""which means no one is"". I love how they twist the old cliché of the little boy who can't fit, but this time in the other way.The second consequence was that the rejected sidekick will finally fill his heart with enough anger and resentment to become a supra-villain, in a mix of Lex Luthor and Spectre, in fact, many elements from ""The Incredibles"" borrows from James Bond and the 60's secret service superheroes classics, and the vintage feeling is a delight for the eyes. Even the setting looks like a futuristic view of USA as it was envisioned in the 60's, on this level, Brad Bird and team did a terrific job. Sensual secretaries, tropical landscape, launched missiles, a scene-stealing little designer, voiced by Brad Bird, and who plays the Q role, the super-heroic element is responsible for the greatest thrills while the family is the heart. This combination is the secret of ""The Incredibles"". We know the little boy Dash, will have to run faster than ever for an extreme great chase, we know Violet, the shy teenager will sure be capable to use her power to create magnetic field and impregnable bubbles, but how refreshing to share their first frustration. The kid can't run, and she's so shy she makes herself invisible.It's great to see Mr Incredible reluctant to use his force although sometime he can help it, while he breaks the car window by closing the door too strongly or lifting it out of anger, or doing something we're all dreamed of like squashing the boss in the walls, he has to wait before fully using his powers. And Helen is reluctant to wear her new outfit and when she does, she can't help but notices her curves in the mirror. The script characterization keeps us with the sensation that we're watching real people, and the super powers become almost accessory, they do contribute to a variety of actions but it's all Bob, Helen, Dash, Violet  and yes, the baby Jack-Jack whose powers are unknown yet, but we can figure that they're letting it for the last act. It's a Family film in the real meaning of the word, it's for the family and about a family.Most of the plot relies on very common clichés, but the film is much aware for them, and never hesitates to show it, denouncing the infamous monologue cliché or the way capes can become a lethal target, not to mention Samuel L. Jackson's performance, so authentic, calling it self-parody would be insult."
"This refreshing cartoon is so much fun! And it's honest fun, built on character and story without relying, for a change, on pooh-pooh humor or juvenile idiocy. This film has a family of all-too human characters, which, although each member has special super- human characteristics, is also burdened with all-too-human personal challenges-- whether it be a boring job, the struggle for adolescent identity, or the need to be special in some way--this family is quite wonderful. The Pixar animation is dazzling, from the recreation of wild, tossing seas to the attack of whirring saucers in a tropical jungle, pixar magic takes you there, but only in context of a thrilling story--and the characters are tellingly memorable, especially a costume designer likely based on Hollywood's Edith Head combined with Coco Chanel--who would have thought it in a kiddy pic? How refreshing to have a film that doesn't go for the cheap trick, the easy laugh, the lowest common denominator, but instead aims for genuine heart. This is a family film in the best possible sense of the word and will withstand the test of time."
"The Incredibles was one of Pixar's best films. I didn't find it as good as Ratatouille, Wall-E and Up, but it wasn't as bad as Brave, or as pedestrian as Finding Nemo. It is a very long (for US standards) animated feature at 110 minutes and has much more complexity and character development than the usual animated fare made in the US: this is a family film that adults will like nearly as much as the children (though not 100% as much). It is full of action but nobody appear to die in the film besides the villain: in one scene Mr. Incredible throws a massive metal thing over some guards and they are only disabled. It is a James Bond and superhero spoof, a very well executed one."
"The Incredibles is actually a film better than I thought. I feared to see this film because it sounded boring. I was able to like this film. The story is about a former superhero who went into hiding with his family because of legal lawsuits. Fifteen years later, he wants to return to his old glory days. Now he has to fight one evil superhero to save the world. The acting/voicing in this film is great. Craig T.Nelson and Samuel Jackson were great. The story was written well. It keeps the audiences attracted to the film. The jazzy music is different, but good. This is a film for all ages. I rate this film a 9/10."
"Okay, by now, it's unanimous that Pixar's ""The Incredibles"" is a great family film. So why add another review? It's not because I think I'll say anything that a plethora of other reviewers hasn't already said, but because I feel the ~need~ to say that this is a great family film.Too many movies barely pass for family films these days. They oftentimes contain elements and themes to which we do not wish to have our children exposed. They even, more often than not, contain messages or morals with which we do not agree and find awkward or inappropriate to explain to our children. They even promote lifestyle choices, hereditary and/or cultural differences, or unfortunate wardrobe malfunctions and still pass for family films.This is not one of those movies. The Incredibles is wholesome, witty, and clever, while appealing to all ages. You can't say that about many movies, especially today.All in all? This is a great movie, anytime you want a movie you don't mind your grandparents or young children watching. Plus, it's fun and does not fail to entertain.It rates a 9.2/10 from...the Fiend :."
"I want to congratulate director Brad Bird on one of the most original animated opening sequences I've seen. From the very start of the film, the viewer is all ready to submerge into a film that takes animation and ""children's entertainment"" to a whole new level, and this level isn't just pretentious gibber concocted to look revolutionary. This is the real thing. And it's almost a superb film. But I must take strong, even drastic conflict with the underlying themes that the film presents. What makes the ""The Incredibles"" both excellent and reprehensible is Bird's writing that unfortunately overlooks and neglects aspects in it's presentation. At least I hope so. The film leaps back and forth from a respectable animated film into something dark and ugly, and, amongst such, paints a gloss over it and claims accessibility to children. It is such a fact that I pray is never repeated. Bird's writing flounders in the very fact that it is trying to promote a message, and not a silly one. While doing so in the context of a superhero film, the film meanders back and forth from being real and fantastical. Essentially, the film can't decide what it wants to be. Does it want to pay homage to classic comics where elements of our reality are taken for granted or does it want to portray a strange new world where supers are taken out of context and applied a different role in the society? That is, the film begs to be taken as some kind or allegory, at the time maintaining, even emphasizing it's seriousness. The film contains fantastic voice work from the whole cast involved, and toward the middle of the film there are some impressively convincing moments of drama and suspense. What is further done with this is utterly disappointing. The film sporadically morphs back into a comic book where the lives of everyone except our heroes are meaningless, as is the physical and emotional pain of these characters. Some situations that involve very serious acts perpetuated by the protagonists are never resolved and are thusly deemed as acceptable. This is evident from the very start of the film when our hero, who's personality is much more like the appearances of the characters in ""Monster's Inc"", derides the talent of the soon-to be powerful villain as a youngster and never cares to say anything about it until years later, when the tables are turned. The film's message is to point out that ""no, we aren't all special"", and I can live with that to a certain degree because it's true for the most part. But one wonders if these certain facts are necessary for smaller children to digest? Perhaps this film isn't for them at all, and that's fine. What do I as an older person think? I think these themes scream some pretty reprehensible notions, and it killed any entertaining factor that ""The Incredibles"" had, as well as making me dislike the characters. Aside from our hero's treatment of Buddy and his hardly fairly matched boss in the beginning, when you view what occurred in terms of the film's overall theme it fails to mesh into anything we'd think as admirable if you're the average caring person. Buddy's child-like enthusiasm for his talent is not a bad thing, but it is treated as such. One talent is favored over the other, and I'm not sure why. Justifably, Buddy seeks out to be like his ex-hero and is killed for it. Wait, I'm completely aware of Buddy, who's later turned into Syndrome, is a serial killer. But what can we say about the depiction of a struggling person desperate to be labeled what is considered ""special"" as a vicious murderer? Something just isn't right here. It isn't helped by the very fact that virtually every non-super is either looney or negative in nature. There are further questionable sequences in the film, including the aforementioned violence occurring toward the end, that even while in self-defense, it is not believable when compared to the same intensity of other scenes involving the protagonists in mortal danger. I certainly do demand that films, despite the lowered standards for family entertainment, be further observed beyond their entertainment value or admittedly very good direction. Still, the film is also to be commended for it's artistic landscape, a somewhat 1950's universe laden with modernist design. A true rarity animation for adults is, and this so disappointingly has to offend in an unusual and problematic way."
"Shortest review ever: Incredible.You need more? Fine. Pixar continues an unheard streak of high-quality storytelling and captivating creativity with 2004's answer to the question, ""is there happiness in the world?"" The Incredibles takes place in a world where super-strength, super-speed, super-cool superpowers exist and heroes are adored by the masses they protect. Yet because of impending lawsuits and municipal damages, the government has stepped in to insure our heroes' secret identities are now their only identities. Bob Parr aka Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) is struggling with his new ""normal"" life married to fellow superhero Elastigirl aka Helen (Holly Hunter). His job sucks, the kids have superpowers of their own they're itching to explore and he desperately misses the thrill of crime fighting. In comes a mysterious benefactor who just might be his ticket to a better life.The Incredibles is Pixar's first real attempt at a completely human world populated by four limbed humanoids as opposed to toys or fishes or bugs. Instead of opting for close-to-human features, which most people find creepy, the characters are exaggerated and cartoony. But don't let that fool you into thinking the details of this marvelous film aren't spectacular. The settings range from Tropical Island to bustling metropolis and exhibit a unique feel and personality. The animators must have taken years out of their lives to complete a film of this caliber.Yet even if the film wasn't as technically brilliant as it is, it'd still have a great story populated by great characters. Each main character is a new spin on the typical nuclear family with Bob being the lovable but unrealized provider who needs help with his priorities. Helen is the overworked mother, wife and voice of reason yet unlike the valium-taking housewives of the 1950's she can kick all kinds of butt. In tow are three precocious, bickering children: Dash (Spencer Fox) who possesses super-speed, Violet (Sarah Vowell) who has the power of invisibility much like many young teenagers feel they do and Jack-Jack a toddler seemingly lacking superpowers. Also in the mix is the nefarious villain Syndrome (Jason Lee) who reeks of abandonment issues and riotous Edith Head parody Edna Mode (Director Brad Bird) who nearly steals the movie.I'm honestly surprised that a story like this hasn't been done before. There might be some serials back in the day that expounded on similar themes but I cannot recall any. Sure there are elements of superheroes turned unsanctioned vigilantes in Batman-lore and The Watchmen and The Fantastic Four does have familial ties. But mixing these two themes and adding in a cottage industry in superhero costumes; that's not just new to film but to superherodom.If on the off-chance you were trapped underneath something heavy for the last ten years and haven't seen The Incredibles, I recommend that you go and see what you've been missing. It's a brilliant original story, artfully crafted to perfection by the dream-makers of Pixar and voiced by smartly casted actors. Did I also mention it's a non-stop thrill ride unlike any other? Well believe me when I tell you that it truly is."
"It is often said that there are 2 things in this world that are guaranteed: death and taxes. I would like to argue that there is a third: Pixar movies will be an instant classic. Ever since the first Toy Story was released in 1995, I have eagerly awaited the release of each new movie. When The Incredibles was released in 2004, I could not get to the theater soon enough, and needless to say, I was not disappointed. In a time when generic superhero movies are released every few months, Pixar created a superhero movie with an engaging story that focuses more on the characters than watching the heroes save the world from total destruction. The story focuses primarily on Mr. Incredible and his struggle to find meaning in life after a series of lawsuits has caused superheroes to go into hiding. The once loved superhero spends his day working a monotonous desk job and his evenings listening to a radio scanner with his friend Frozone in hopes of reliving the glory days. The story connected with me because I believe we all have the desire to live for something greater than ourselves and to find purpose in life, yet we find ourselves sitting behind a desk and never reaching our full potential. The ""superhero"" story revolves around Mr. Incredible attempting to save the world from his one-time #1 fan, now turned villain, Syndrome. This challenge brings the Incredible family together and helps them realize the importance of working as a team and realizing that their abilities should not be hidden, but used to make a difference in the world.Another area where Pixar shines is in their character development. From the insecure adolescent with the ability to disappear to the super busy mom who can stretch herself to accomplish whatever task is needed, the characters powers were brilliantly chosen to fit what power one would expect someone in that stage of life would need. Even the villain was someone that I could relate to. I'm sure most people have had someone they looked up to let them down, and although most of us do not become that person's arch-nemesis, I could feel sympathy for the guy. If anything, Syndrome's back story shows how much of an impact we can have on people who may look up to us. All of this plus the stunning computer animation, intelligent humor, and wholesome fun helps continue the company's streak of top-notch movies. It challenges the viewer to find their purpose/meaning in life while also encouraging them to accept and use whatever gifts he or she may have. Six years after its release, this movie still remains at the top of my list of favorite Pixar movies and in the top 5 of my all-time favorite movies."
"Superheroes have to go into hiding ala the witness protection program after civilians start to take advantage by suing the gifted ones in crazed lawsuits. Now all superheroes must live as their alter egos in a world where having special powers is frowned upon all of a sudden. The patriarch of the titled family though becomes the target of a deviant individual who was once his biggest fan. Thus it is up to his family to save him so the group can save the world once more. ""The Incredibles"" is strong with its animation, but honestly the story is hit-and-miss. Hanna and Barbara-styled ideas from the 1960s and 1970s mix with that dark comic book look that was so prevalent in the 1930s and 1940s to form a long (and I do mean long) cartoon that suffers an identity crisis with its tone and pace. The characters have their moments, but most are not as interesting as they look. Director Brad Bird has crafted a film that definitely has more upside than down because of its glossy look and hot visuals. However, I still think that a little more time could have been spent on the script and on the movie's potential uniqueness. Unfortunately, ""The Incredibles"" really pales to most recent computer generated productions. 4 stars out of 5."
"After many unfair lawsuits against superheroes, inflicted by persons saved by them, the government requests the superheroes to retire and hide their identity as if they were normal citizens. Mr. Incredible marries Elastigirl, has three children (Violet, Dash and Jack Jack) and has a boring job in an insurance company. When a chance is offered to Mr. Incredible to become a hero again, he becomes happy and in shape. However, when the identity of the mysterious contractor is revealed, the family has to fight together against the evil Syndrome to stay alive. ""The Incredible"" is an amazing movie, and has superseded my best expectation of an animation. The story is excellent, having action and humor in right doses, the characters are very charismatic and it is a movie recommended as an excellent family entertainment. Today there are 528 comments, most of them favorable, and the movie is in top 250: #91. Therefore, I believe it is not necessary to extend my review. Last but not the least, ""The Incredible"" is a movie that really deserves to be among the IMDb Top 100. Lets wait for the inevitable sequel My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Os Incríveis"" (""The Incredibles"")"
"Most Pixar films get good reviews from the critics, but they seem to be falling all over themselves for THE INCREDIBLES. I'm not sure why.First off, the film strikes me as a pastiche of the Saturday morning cartoons I grew up watching, like THE FANTASTIC FOUR and JONNY QUEST, with a little James Bond thrown in. As such, it seems designed to appeal most to 10- to 14-year-old boys, a group that may be reluctant to go to an animated movie; witness the anemic box office of TITAN A.E. or TREASURE PLANET for proof.By and large, the story is played straight. There are a few laughs scattered here and there, but the tone is nothing like the mixture of humor and pathos Pixar established for the medium with TOY STORY and Dreamworks exaggerated ad nauseam in SHREK 2.Perhaps that's what the critics find appealing. THE INCREDIBLES is certainly not like any other animated film I've seen; at times, it's easy to forget that it *is* animated. Some of that is due to the ever-growing artistry of the Pixar team, which often makes you feel like you're watching a comic book/video game come to life.But as solid as the movie is -- and except for a slow start, I was not bored -- for me, it's missing that little bit of magic to take it to the next level, where millions have found Shrek and Nemo."
"Movies don't just entertain -- they MEAN. They have messages. They instruct, influence, and evoke.So what is the meaning of _The_Incredibles_? Simple: You Don't Count.I am, perhaps, unusual in that I scrutinize every movie, TV show, newspaper story and advertisement for its deeper message -- but I think that practice is a lot more common when we consider media aimed at children, as this movie, with its toy tie-ins and McDonalds-driven marketing, most certainly is. So when friends suggested that Pixar had hit another one out of the park with _The_Incredibles_, I naturally screened it for my kid, thinking this would be a beauty.Imagine my shock and dismay to find that, underneath the comic-book overtones, this is not a movie for kids at all. Not only is the violence fast, furious, and rampant, it's deadly...as the characters themselves point out, Saturday Morning Cartoons offer kids an unrealistic belief that deadly violence is somehow fun. Well OK, I can get behind that message, but it's going to be tricky explaining to my six-year-old that when he sees a plane full of bad-guys blow up as it rips through a tree, that this isn't just metaphorical -- that guy is DEAD.But I got more and more disturbed when I saw that the majority of the violence in this movie wasn't being perpetrated by the bad guys at all -- it's mostly coming from our ""heroes,"" The Incredible family themselves. Mr. I. uproots trees, tosses bombs, knocks down buildings, and punches mere mortal villains with fists which we've seen lift train cars. And then, in a fit of pique, in an early establishing scene, Mr. Incredible punches his boss. Who is *NOT* a villain. He's an unarmed civilian, which Mr. Incredible outweighs by about 200 pounds. He punches this guy through several walls, and later views of this poor guy in the hospital make it clear that he's broken a lot of bones.This is our HERO???? And then there's the main message of the film: you don't count. You see you, me, all us non-super-heroes, we aren't ""special,"" like the Incredibles. And no, the idea that everyone has some special quality, that everyone has unique skills or traits, that's disdained by our hero as a ""celebration of mediocrity"" -- his normal job, like the one you and I have, you see that's not good enough for the special people. No, the special people should be given the opportunity to requisition government aircraft, to own supercars they haven't paid for, to throw civilians through walls without any consequence if they act annoying. In fact, the guy who suggests that everyone *could* be special or super, if given the chance, is the VILLAIN of the movie! So there goes about 2,000 years worth of morality, right down the drain. According to this movie, might makes right, and anyone who thinks otherwise deserves to be stomped into the pavement. Jesus wept."
"People have been making fun of superhero clichés for more than ten years, since before The Tick, Tiny Toons and the like, and this itself has been a cliché: to observe, ""Bad guys have giant secret lairs! And they ""monologue"" before they kill you! LOL."" It's an easier formula than actually inventing a new superhero saga.Now this worn-out schtick has unfortunately become the basis for a Pixar movie. Not nearly as well-written as ""Toy Story,"" this thing feels like it was written on autopilot, with only the most obvious plot developments proceeding from the ""what if a suburban family were superheroes?"" premise with a clanking predictability (Writer: ""OMG, here's the part where they fight over a remote control! And they fight over traffic directions! And...what else do married couples do?"") that made me wonder whether Brad Bird was a screenwriter's pseudonym for Omnibot 7000.While the movie pretends like it's about breaking out of suburban conformity, it comes across like a celebration of it. I would rather have watched a movie about Samuel Jackson's character, Frozone, who provides some spark amid the numbing sitcom vibe. The pic further loses points for taking cheap shots at the French, public interest law, and human life. 'Cuz halfway through, the movie seems to get superheroes badly confused with James Bond, and this annoying family proceeds to spend quite a while killing off identical-looking bad guys, rather remorselessly: someone is blown to bits, and in the next shot everyone is hugging. The family that kills together...Real superheroes bring people to justice, rather than slaughtering them. Not that this is a violent movie in its slaying of faceless drones. No, what you get feels like you're stuck at the house of the dullest people you know, while they play PS2 in their living room. I liked it better when it was called ""Metal Gear.""And, yeah, would a memorable joke be too much to ask?"
"Though well made, sometimes very funny and imaginative, in the end THE INCREDIBLES could just as well be called The Unremarkables. While certainly a nice job is done by all, THE INCREDIBLES has the poor fortune to follow Pixar's other masterpieces to the screen and can't rise out of the shadows of the TOY STORY films, MONSTERS, INC. and FINDING NEMO. THE INCREDIBLES sets it sites higher than those films, as far as its outlandish story goes, but while its save-the-world adventure seems more grand in comparison to the seemingly mundane antics of the other films' miniature characters, the story comes off as being really rather ordinary. THE INCREDIBLES has really nothing new to offer, just an odd juxtaposition of old ideas and clichés from the two genres it grafts together. In tying together the world of the typical family sitcom with the premise of a routine superhero adventure, the film seeks originality, but the most remarkable thing about the film is that it shows that superhero tales have become just as mundane as your typical family sitcom. I think the magic of Pixar's previous efforts comes from more than just the wonderful artwork. Those films took us to other worlds or forced us to look at our world from a different perspective. THE INCREDIBLES goes from everyday suburbia to the inner sanctum of a mad genius out to control the world and the sad reality is that we have already been to the latter as often, if not more so, than the former. Saving the world is just not what it used to be; on the heels of James Bond, Spider-Man, Superman and an endless list of others, what The Incredibles do is old hat. And let's face it, in the toon world what these characters do is not that big of a deal either; from Bugs Bunny and Wiley Coyote to Goofy and Roger Rabbit, being indestructible and defying the laws of physics are pretty common tricks.Everything THE INCREDIBLES offers -- strength, speed, flexibility, invisibility -- has a been-there-done-that quality. All the classic cartoon characters were, to one extent or another, already superhuman.As such, superheroism in the toon world is a given; it is when the gifts that defy physics and common sense are endowed on real actors that the genre still has a sense of awe. When Christopher Reeve flies, when Tobey Maguire swings, when James Bond whips out Q's gadgets or Indiana Jones cracks his whip, the images still carry a kick -- men doing what cartoon characters take for granted. We can live vicariously through Superman or James Bond, but how often do we fantasize being Donald Duck or even Underdog?To me, the Incredibles' derring-do pales in comparison to the toys in TOY STORY figuring out how to drive a car or the great aquarium escape in FINDING NEMO. Just as much imagination may have been expended in helping The Incredibles save New York City, but how many times have we seen New York saved in recent years? On the other hand, the trip through the closet to Monstropilis was a wonderful new experience. This is not to say that THE INCREDIBLES is a bad or unrewarding. Indeed, it was worth it just to hear Holly Hunter as Elastigirl -- with that voice she was born to do cartoon voiceovers."
"Maybe it's because I first saw this film six years after it was made, but I can't really see why such a big thing was made of it.I got an overwhelming feeling of ""is this it?"" when I saw it. That's not to say that this is a bad movie by any means, but there is nothing outstanding about it either. Of course, this could be said about a lot of films but is particular pertinent here when one considers the huge hype surrounding it when it first came out.It is quite an enjoyable tale about superheroes being forced to hide their identities, bring up families and fitting in until one day Mr Incredible gets the chance to relive the glory days...There are some very funny characters (Edna and Huph in particular) and most of the cast do their job well although Holly Hunter's lisp does get a little distracting after a while. Having the fifties titles and appearance is a nice touch which makes the whole film appear a little different from the norm.Like I said before, this is a good film, although if you haven't seen it before, try to forget all the hype surrounding it when it first came out."
"this movie is perhaps one of the best marketing/advertising feats of recent years. a movie that is totally without redeeming qualities - a movie that in fact is politically insulting and totally formulaic becomes a hit that makes the IMDb top 100. either the population at large is sadly lacking in intelligence and standards, or they are sheep. or both. this movie was so terrible there aren't words enough to describe it.for those of you considering renting/buying it - please, I BEG you - DON'T DO IT! these are a couple hours you will never get back!!! for those of you considering this film for your kids I'd say great idea, if you want them to grow up with the same values and personality (or lack thereof) as june cleaver and betty flintstone."
"This film is from another from the much acclaimed Pixar company which have made other hits such as Finding Nemo, A Bug's Life and Monsters Inc, and F.N. and B.L. were pleasant enough (M.I. was pretty poor) so it was slightly unexpected to see Pixar deliver us this dull and unoriginal script for a superhero flick.The Incredibles lacks the intelligent humour which has made so many animated movies in the past decade appeal to all members of the family and it tries to make up for this with poor references to things parents might know and it works with the concept of superheroes who can't just use their powers and have the glory in the world we live in. This is a good concept for a movie to work from as it hasn't been tackled particularly successfully in the past but unfortunately, this doesn't do the job any better and we are left wondering how such a mundane and 'going by the numbers' movie has made so much money. But then we realise, any society which can enable rubbish such as Titanic, Harry Potter and Wedding Crashers to make money will give any movie a chance.I guess I'm in the minority with these views but I'm sure people will come round to my way of thinking and make the movie industry deliver us better comedy than this tripe."
"I know it's a common practice to aim straight at the ""one star"" rating for films you only moderately dislike. But if I could give this movie ZERO stars, I would do so without blinking. This movie is one of the worst things I've ever sat through. It was impossible to even try to care about anything here - story, characters, animation, action, and so the list goes. I admit I was turned-off from the movie right from the start, just because of the hype, the advertising, the merchandising, and all of that. And I also hated Shrek with a passion, but when I rented this DVD, I honestly, sincerely tried to like the movie, approaching it with an unbiased mind. Really, I did. What a disappointment. If I watched the movie already expecting to hate it, my feelings wouldn't be so bitter.The entire movie is pretty much an insult - a preposterous ""family"" story involving superheroes (a culture that I *despise*, but hey, I thought this would be awesome, cruel parody on it) and lame, idiotic morals. I'm actually puzzled at what *was* the message here, but in the end, the less I think about it, the better. None of the characters did anything to me. Nothing at all was even remotely funny. But what really got me was the attempt at doing something ""adult"", ""serious"" and ""meaningful"". To me, it was just overreaching. They were trying so hard to make a *statement* with that movie, they failed to make it entertaining and rewarding. Besides, why was the movie advertised for kids, anyway? This movie had *nothing* at all to do with kids. To me, it isn't very honest to do ""serious"", ""adult"" animation and advertise it as a kids movie just to earn easy money. Not honest at all.The attitude of the movie bugged me. It seemed to be building up towards something important, something truly earth-shattering. And as it approached the end, it just became more and more ridiculous and insulting - the scene showing soldiers making a ""drinking game"" with the live footage on TV, culminating with Mr. Incredible ""heroically"" beating them to a pulp (away from the camera, of course! Gotta be P.C.!), was the moment when I was convinced I should stop watching. But I didn't, and it just got worse. The movie climaxed with the baby, Jack-Jack, showing his superpowers as if nobody saw that coming (come on, did the writers think I was THAT dumb?), and humiliating the villain with all sorts of glories. And like that wasn't enough, the writers KILL the villain, just to make us go ""wow, that's SO bold and unexpected for a family movie!"" The ending arrives, and happens exactly the way I predicted it to go. Well, not true... I didn't think the movie would sink SO LOW to the point of making another moralistic climax with Dash purposefully finishing the race on second place.I am convinced. The more gushing, brainless raves a movie gets, the worse it is. That is the only logical explanation I can come up with for garbage like this to be passed off as some revolutionary masterpiece. Not even the animation was noteworthy - it was so polished, so squeaky-clean, so show-offy and state-of-the-art that it was just plain boring to look at. Instead of trying to entertain us, Pixar just tried to show off. And since people are so easily impressed by such arrogance, I guess they can get away with it. But in a few years, that stuff will be horribly dated - kind of like The Matrix. You know such love for technology has a price. Please, if you want to watch a movie, go watch a movie made for human beings. Leave ""The Incredibles"" for the robots and the androids when they take over the human race - it will be surefire MST3K material."
"When Pixar announced that they'd recruited Brad Bird to direct their new film it was treated with surprise. Sure Bird had been a major part of the Simpsons, he'd been instrumental in creating one of the best recent cartoon features (the Iron Giant) and sure he was a breath of fresh air to the Pixar formula. But why try and fix something that is not only not broken but is positively bursting at the seams with creative energy, commercial viability and critical acclaim? The naysayers, and there were a fair few of them, urged caution and sat back to see if Pixar would make their first misstep after a series of blindingly brilliant films that had knocked their competitor from a perch that had been regarded as impregnable.Disney's misfortune had been our, the viewing public's, great reward. From their childish cartoons we'd suddenly learnt to appreciate and even prefer other possibilities, most specifically computer generated films. Toy Story had come out of nowhere to deliver a killer blow to Disney's tired remakes and uninspired sequels. Ignoring realism in favour of a fun, flexible world where reality existed but didn't automatically infringe on the entertainment, the geniuses at Pixar created a film that didn't try and reinvent the wheel but gave it such an overhaul that the finished product really did look completely new.By realising that people don't like computer generated images, particularly of human beings, which always look and move too perfectly for us to ever accept them, Pixar instead showed us a world of cute toys and giant, fairly irrelevant humans. With the voices incredibly well cast and the images sharp enough to impress without trying to blitz us with colour, Toy Story demonstrated just how excellent CG could be, provided it was married to a good story aimed at kids and adults alike. From there Pixar went from strength to strength, both at the box office and in the reviews. So, again, we must ask: why did they seek the change? We may never know exactly what happened. My understanding is that Brad Bird approached Pixar with the story and they offered him the directing stint by way of reflecting how impressed they were. This rings slightly false in that you wouldn't entrust millions of dollars to a screen writer to make a live action film and the money and directorial duties are by no means reduced for 3D animation. Therefore I think that Bird was given the gig for other reasons, most specifically that the Pixar team were worried that their tried and tested formula was becoming too obvious - mismatched buddies must retrieve something/someone precious from a perilous situation. Regardless, employ him they did and The Incredibles was the result.The Incredibles represents Pixar's best, most adult film and was both a critical and commercial hit with adults and infants alike. It contained all the action and special effects one could wish for, but kept them based around a solid, emotional core of plot, characterisation and witty story telling. Like most, if not all, Pixar films, The Incredibles was designed by adults for adults who were looking to entertain children, rather than by adults looking to exploit children (Disney should take note here and, given that they've recently acquired Pixar, it looks like they've done exactly that). This meant that the film was just as interesting to parents (and uncles) as it was to children, doubling the audience size and making the later, night showings at cinemas just as popular as the daytime ones. In foreign countries, France for example, many of the adults actually ignored the dubbed, local language versions in favour of the original English, for fear of missing some of the brilliant, adult orientated jokes (Bomb Voyage can't possibly have been as amusing in French as he was in English for example).All this comes from Bird's screenplay and it is from there that The Incredibles bursts forth, ahead of the pack. Bird fused numerous, diverse elements to tell the story of a dysfunctional family of superheroes. Mr. Incredible, Bob Parr, is a former superhero forced into retirement, along with all other super heroes, through legal action , an idea I have long considered given how litigious modern society has become. Bob and his wife Helen, the former heroine Elastigirl, disappear to start a family in suburbia.After 15 years and three kids Bob is fast approaching a midlife crisis. Other than helping the occasional client dodge the pitfalls in the insurance company he works at the only fun he has is illegal hero work found by listening in on the police radio network with his friend Frozone, another former superhero voiced superbly by Samuel L Jackson. Bob is heading for emotional meltdown when, through an unfortunate series of events, he finds himself approached with an offer for true heroism...The first half of the film, Bob's emotional emancipation followed by his attempted breakout and its consequences, gives way to the action filled second, which I won't spoil by delving into, save to say that it incorporates more than Bob. There is brilliance a plenty, the jet fight was one of the most tense scenes I've ever experienced, while at no point do you end up seeing action purely for its own sake. Each action has a far more important reaction, not least in terms of emotional growth. Numerous issues are analysed and a very positive message of family, confidence without arrogance and just being there for other people are subtly advocated.All in all I can't recommend this movie enough, particularly as it may well be the last great Pixar film. With Disney's takeover of the company we now have the bringing together of bland, tasteless, star heavy, plot lite films such as Shrek 2, Shark Tale and the like with the genius of Pixar. We can only hope that the heart and minds of the latter win out."
"Bob Parr(Craig T. Nelson) is famous superhero Mr. Incredible who gets married to Helen(Holly Hunter) who is Elastigirl. After lawsuits against superheros for not wanting to be saved, they settle down, have three kids named Violet, Dash, and Jack Jack, and Bob gets a steady job. But Bob still wants the excitement in his life and spends late nights looking for evil with Lucius Best(Samuel L. Jackson) who used to be Frozone. After almost losing his job, Bob suddenly gets a secret message telling him that they have a job for him on a secret island. Bob fixes up the old suit and goes back to Mr. Incredible leading to journey that the whole family can enjoy.This the best animated film of all time. The movie is funny for kids, teens, and adults. I'm 17 and I still watch the movie constantly. The animation is incredible too. It is better than that of Toy Story and Finding Nemo. The movie is action packed and carries a great story with it. Overall, the movie is the best animated film I have ever seen. I was very impressed.I highly recommend this family film."
"THE INCREDIBLES (2004) **** (VOICES of: Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Samuel L. Jackson, Jason Lee, Sarah Vowell, Spencer Fox, Elizabeth Pena, Brad Bird, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger) (Dir: Brad Bird) Pixar does it again! Wonderfully funny and fast-paced animated valentine to comic book heroes with a unique spin: the titular family of action heroes are part of a federal witness relocation program - after society has deemed them too 'special' resulting in far-too-many legal woes  that eventually find themselves back fighting the good fight when Mr. Incredible (Nelson in square-jawed jocularity) faces a new enemy in the form of Syndrome (Lee, having a snarky field day), a former fan of the superhero who has now made it his life's mission to off his one-time would-be mentor, while attempting to raise a family with Elastigirl (the ever feisty and able Hunter) with varied results. Excellently cast  especially NPR personality Vowell as the Incredible' eldest, painfully shy daughter (love the curtain of hair-one-eye look!) Violet and Fox as the middle, precocious tow-headed son (aptly named) Dash who both are becoming aware of their 'specialness' as adolescence beckons (metaphors aplenty!) Jackson lends able support as fellow hero Frozone, a (literally) cool dude bud of the family as well as the ever irrepressible Shawn as the pip-squeaked 'boss' of Mr. Incredible's alias Bob Parr, an insurance claims adjustor; and Pena as a femme fatale named Mirage who bares more than a striking resemblance to Gwyneth Paltrow morphed with a pipe cleaner. But it is director Bird who steals the show voicing the fashionista/costume designer Edna E. Mode  think Linda Hunt meets Edith Head  in a hilarious no-holds-barred slap of surreality to the reluctantly returning superheroes into the fray. Bird is also no slouch in keeping the breakneck pace and overall retro '50s/'60s look of the film (think those Rankin Bass holiday animated specials) while expertly sifting pop culture in-the-knowisms to the genre at hand. What is most surprising is the warmhearted emotion that is on display with the gut-busting comedy juggling act of breathless action. One of the year's best films."
"Am I missing something here? When this movie came out last year everyone went on about it like it cured cancer. Well I just saw it on DVD. What is remotely new about this movie? Nothing. It's nice visually, but so what? I thought it was going to be a biting, snide and outrageous parody. Instead we get the same old family dynamics and boring ""be yourself"" speeches.A few minor jokes about expanding waistlines do not carry a movie. And frankly, too much action leaves me numb and animated action even more so. The whole idea of the stay-at-home (not to mention incredibly NAGGING) mother was a bit tired. And I thought the black character was really insulting. Was it necessary for him to be a jive-talking stereotype? This movie is for people who actually thought Finding Nemo was good too."
"This movie could have been so much more. Unless you're a fan of the technical aspects of animation this movie is a real letdown for all but the preteens. If you take your 8 year old to see this movie I'm sure they will enjoy it and want to see it a million more times, just look at the box office for Yûgiô. Unlike the feeling you get from the trailers and promos, that is the audience that will be attracted to this movie. I left the theater with my brain feeling numb, you know, that feeling you can get when you've spent a whole Saturday morning in front of the TV watching cartoons. The feel of the animation is better than Saturday morning cartoons but the plot is the same. The characters don't develop and the inconsistencies in the plot are horrible. It is very obvious that the creators have hopes for a long running series for these characters. I couldn't shake the thought that I was watching a pilot for a bad ""Simpsons"" instead of a feature length movie.For parents of young children this movie will be great as your children will be entertained. This is doomed though to be one of those movies you will buy for your children when it comes out on DVD and then have to watch with them thousands of times. It lacks the ""smart"" type of humor that can transcend between both child and adult so prepare to be bored. All in all, this is a good movie to entertain your small children but don't expect much on an adult level. 2 of 10 for the nice animation work."
"Big Pixar fan here. Also a big CGI fan. I took my three kids today to the movie and left a little dazed by its pace and length.I had superhuman expectations for this movie and it came up just a bit short. The action was great. The CGI was fantastic. But after all that, it just seemed to be missing something. To me, the ""style"" of the movie wasn't terribly notable either. Unlike Nemo and even Toy Story or Bug's Life, there were few ""wow"" moments where the eye candy of the CGI spoiled the viewer. Perhaps it's because we've already been spoiled from past Pixar and Shrek level pictures. This picture takes the action to a whole new level but that aspect tended to blur too many times for my tastes. Viewers who loved the thoughtful moments of The Iron Giant may be a bit disappointed here. Some of my favorite moments of The Incredibles were the small, clever instances rather than the manic action. I laughed out loud at some of these instances and wanted more. The Samuel L. Jackson character seemed underdeveloped. Even the main characters seemed thin to me. Yeah, we learned about Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl's early career fame, but nothing prior.I think this movie will stand out in the Pixar collection for the action, but it's getting easier for these CGI movies to numb the senses. There's enough here to satisfy many types of viewers, but the pace will make a second viewing necessary to get everything. Having seen The Polar Express premier the same weekend, I may have been jaded. TPE is heads and shoulders above TI in my opinion, but the former's story was already a classic. The quality of its CGI was jaw dropping too, where as The Incredibles just seemed very good.I think we expect each new computer animated movie to set a higher standard than the previous, but they'll have to level out at some point. I think we may be near that point (i.e. Shark Tale). It's now possible with CGI to do ""anything"". But the story will continue to be most important. I noticed during several points of The Incredibles that I should be more impressed with what they were able to do on screen, but I felt it didn't matter. The story wasn't keeping my interest a well as I would have liked.Pixar has set a high standard and this movie will make them financially happy, but I don't think it's Oscar-worthy. They're mortal and may not please all of us all of the time. But it's hard to not expect instant classics from them, which may be our fault more than theirs."
"I saw the previews, read the articles, checked IMDb and thought this was going to be a fantastic film along the lines of the 'Finding Nemo' and 'Toy Story'. From the extra preview to the cartoon to the feature I was more and more disappointed. The voice talent was good with Craig T Nelson surprisingly good as the voice of the Bob Parr and I enjoyed Holly Hunter as Helen Parr but the story was rehashed bits already done well by others and the plot was flat. The movie turned into ""Spy Kids"" halfway through. The chase scene through the jungle was directly out of ""Return of the Jedi"". The dysfunctional family angle was boring and Samuel L. Jackson's character was too small and stereotypical. I would have left early but I kept hoping that it was going to finally start getting good and sad to say it didn't. The only good part of the movie was the little boy on the Big Wheel."
"With the on-set of numerous law suits, which are costing the Government millions, super-heroes are forced to go into hiding under the witness protection program. Forced to lead mundane, ordinary lives and go under societies radar; one of these heroes turned civilians is Bob Par (aka Mr. Incredible aka voice of Craig T. Nelson) and his wife Helen (aka Elastigirl aka voice of Holly Hunter). But life is difficult for the Par family; especially with their three confused children. Especially for Violet (voice of Sarah Vowell) and little brother Dash (Spencer Fox) who have grown up believing their super-human powers are a flaw, not an asset. On-top of family crises, Bob isn't happy. He misses the 'old days' and tries to cling to his past by keeping in touch with his old friend Frozone (aka Lucius Best aka voice of Samuel L. Jackson) and listening to police radios for the 'low down'. So when Bob is approached by Mirage (Elizabeth Peña) who offers him a chance to step back into the limelight, he jumps. But the tests Bob is put through; like defeating a ball robot; are really apart of Mirage's evil boss Syndrome's (jason lee) attempt to wipe-out superheroes until he is the only one left. Now it is a matter of Helen and her children working together to save their Incredible father.... and the world.While ""The Incredibles"" had praise heaped upon it; I simply cant see what all the fuss was about. There are no gags in this film whatsoever. Pixar's usual trademark wry, adult humor are not at all present in this film and it is sorely lacking because of it. And despite the glossy, bold colorings; it is essentially a dark film. There are moments of conflict which are entirely too serious for a children's movie; and a little uncomfortable. And while I am not one of those people who rambles on about violence in the movies and TV affecting today's youth; there is a lot of violence in this animation, and it is simply too excessive not to comment on. A lot of guns; which, despite being computer-graphics, are still very real in appearance and frequently used. Lots of explosions, crashes, punches etc... I know this is a film about super-heroes and villains; but I just couldn't get past how unsettling it all was. And trust me when I say it is odd for me to comment on such a thing; I am usually one of those people complaining about how up-tight all those PG13 lovers are.The Incredibles lacks the charm and essential wit normally characterized by a Pixar film. In comparison to its predecessors, ""The Incredibles"" is incredibly lacking. It is unfunny, uninteresting and all of the violence is somewhat unnecassary. What a disappointment. But hey; if you want to jump onto the band wagon, go right ahead. When has quality ever really gotten in the way of that sheep-mentality anyway?"
"I was trapped at a family gathering and forced to sit through this turkey, or else insult my host! Who can I send a bill to at Disney to get my time back? Plot TOTALLY predictable, I could tell you which movie EVERY SCENE was ripped off from, same for the music, no chance passed over to make some politically correct, feminist, Dad is a moron little message.WAY too long! I don't think I'll ever watch another Disney movie again.I don't know of any kids who are stupid enough to enjoy this loser!I don't care about special effects, I've got to have a STORY!Why doesn't Hollywood believe in hiring real writers anymore?Save this one for Thanksgiving dinner!"
"possible spoilersThe Incredibles, the latest film from Pixar, is yet the latest disappointment for me. Don't get me wrong. This is by no means a bad film... sadly, it's just that the film isn't that good, or at least as good as I would have hoped. The film takes place in a world where super-heroes, or ""supers"" as they're called, have been prohibited. One of them, Bob Parr, aka Mr. Incredible, is eventually called back into action by a mysterious person, who turns out to be... Buddy, a guy who lost it after Mr. Incredible refused to let him be his teen sidekick. Since then, Buddy, now calling himself Syndrome, has secretly been killing all of the supers off one by one, until there's only a handful left: Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, and Frozone. When things eventually get too tough for Mr. Incredible to handle, it's up to his wife Helen(aka Elastigirl) and their kids, Dash and Violet to land a hand. Overall, the storyline is pretty weak. It's a bit predictable, and nothing that much comes as a surprise, although the characters are for the most part likable. My major complaint with The Incredibles, however, would be that midway through it completely changes into a brain-dead action film, and if I wanted something like that, I would have watched a Bond movie. There isn't enough of the trademark ""Pixar"" wit that has been in films like Toy Story and Monsters Inc, something that I really enjoy. If I wanted an all-out action flick, I would have watched something like Overall, I probably could have waited until this came out on video and DVD."
"This film is just a monumental bore! I have even conducted a straw-poll amongst my colleagues in the IT System Support Dept and have yet to find anyone who has actually watched/suffered this movie right to the end. The animation may be good but the story is immensely dull and ponderous. I wonder just what is supposed to be the target audience for this movie? My eight-year old daughter found that much of the dialogue was too grown-up for her. Whilst my wife and I found much of it to be down at ""cartoon level"" and rather too simplistic for an Adult Audience. At least we were able to enjoy watching ""Shark Tale"" as a family, as it worked on several levels! I heartily recommend &#8220;The Incredibles&#8221; as a cure for insomnia!"
"The entire setup should have taken perhaps 10 minutes. The script was clunky, and the dialog was mundane, boring, and trite. The chemistry between the characters was missing. Very little of the cleverness I usually associate with Pixar. Usually I'm laughing from the opening credits, but this one had me searching for something to find redeeming. Even the opening cartoon was weird, tho I credit Pixar for bringing back the wonderful tradition of a cartoon before the main feature.I just couldn't relate with the characters and the whole premise.On the plus side, the animation work was very nicely done. We got our money back after asking politely at the front desk.I suppose I'll have to rent it to see what happened in the latter 45 minutes. Please enlighten me as to what I missed!"
"I'm sorry but this is one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life! First there was simply nothing I could find that was funny in the movie.. YEAH! there were some small jokes, but none that made me burst out in laughter... Also the family scenes were terrible because all you can hear was bickering from the little twits.. it was a total waste of time, money, and probably for the creators even if they don't admit it.. I have to say the first time I saw it I thought it was OK... BUUUTT only because I was so excited to see the movie that I was open to everything.. then when I saw it for the 2nd time I just left the place.PIXAR HAS DONNEE WAY BETTER FILMS!!!!! Don't see it seriously it is a waste of time!!!"
"I don't know what movie the other comments refer to, but it was not The Incredibles.To start with, the Internet short that has been around for a long time seemed to indicated that this was a comedy. Well, the Internet sequences WERE NOT EVEN INCLUDED IN THE MOVIE. So those who laughed over the making the belt fitting scene will be sorely disappointed not to see it.This movie is NOT a comedy. It is black on a number of fronts and is not good for a younger audience. Try an incredibly violent Spy Kids.The violence is on many fronts. There is a missile downing of an aeroplane with children on board. There are several violent deaths e.g. enemies flying into cliffs. This is culturally wrong because super heroes do not kill people. Secondly, billing this movie as an animation implies a level of non-violence.There is a marital dispute that runs sourly throughout the entire movie. This is never even resolved by the end of the movie. I went to be entertained, not reminded of the difficulties of balancing my marriage.Holly Hunter was a bad choice for the mother.There was appalling grammar throughout the movie, further advancing the entertainment industries intention to ruin the English language.From a technical perspective there were a number of advances in wet scenes, water in general and lighting. However, Pixar concentrated a lot on human faces and the lip synching was noticeably bad and was a distraction throughout the movie.I am not sure where Pixar is going now, but this is not a good direction. We went to a afternoon performance with a younger audience and the only laughter was at the end.Boring, violent, and very disappointing."
"I saw this movie with my girlfriend a while ago. I thought it was pretty shocking. I can not believe such a crappy movie can get a better rating than beautiful movies such as Platoon and The Deer Hunter. Those movies actually have some meaning. This is just garbage.Apart from the animation which is, I have to admit fairly good, this movie is probably one of the worst I've seen. Not only is it incredibly boring (which is probably where it gets its name from) it glorifies violence. Killing people is seen as normal and to think little kids will be watching it, thats not a good thing for them. To make matters worse the plot is inconsistent. Also the film wasn't funny. I mean they made fun of Bob Parr's weight so many times that it just wasn't funny anymore. (Not that I personally thought anything in this film was funny). About 2 times in the entire movie, people actually laughed. So thats saying something about the humor content of this film. All in all it's an insult this made the IMDb top 250. Probably all the little kids came on here and gave it tens. Or the population enjoys being bored out of their mind watching a disjointed plot.In conclusion, if your a preteen thats been brainwashed by the media to love this, then I feel sorry for you but at least you have an excuse, you haven't been around very long and haven't had the opportunity to see many good films, yet. If your a(n) teen/adult who enjoyed this movie then your obviously an idiot who should simply grow up and actually watch some good films like Platoon or The Godfather."
"Don't get me wrong...it has its moments. But they are few and far between in this film.The decision to make the story more ""real"" by having the superheroes portrayed as an ordinary family with ordinary family problems went a long way to disappoint me, even though I had expected this from reviews. To me ""ordinary"" and ""super"" are two words that should never get mixed together. I appreciate the movie's thought that, if everyone had superpowers, then everyone would be ordinary, but come on. I want to be entertained, not run through an updated episode of The Flintstones.Another nail in the coffin for this one was the hype. Once again, the movie moguls hype up a film, raising our expectations to silly levels. How can we be anything but disappointed with the reality?If you compare this movie to the likes of Toy Story or Finding Nemo it doesn't even come close to being in the same league.Unlike those movies, where a bit of affectionate scene plagiarism was appreciated for what it was, The Incredibles just annoyed the Hell out of me with its ""Return of the Jedi"" jungle chase scene. A quick flit through the jungle with the hero being chased by the bad guys - just long enough for you to realize it for what it was - would have been fine. But no. They had to drag the scene out for minute after minute, adding in all the scenes from the RoTJ chase, such as the enemy drawing alongside, the swinging from the vines etc. until you were sick of it and praying it would end.There are some good ideas, but on the whole the film doesn't get my thumbs up of approval. Once again, partly the hype to blame, but also mostly because it's not that good."
"I remember to be expecting to watch ''The Incredibles'' since the first time I watched the trailer in the movie theater; and I also can say that I was not disappointed when I watched it. This movie is very cool! Many years ago,Bob Parr and Helen Parr were famous heroes that helped to save their nation, being known as ''Mr. Incredible'' and ''Elastigirl''.And they were not the only ones: many other heroes also worked with them, one of them 'Frozone'(normal name: Lucius Best) Mr. Incredible's best friend. But the time was passing, and things were changing: many people were unhappy with the heroes, seeing their efforts to help as a threat instead of a good thing. Soon the government asked the heroes to retire their 'uniforms'and act like regular citizens. That's the main base about 'The Incredibles', showing the life of Bob, Helen Parr and their kids trying to fit as 'regular people', trying to avoid their powers. Until a destroying plan of a guy of Bob's past comes to action.."
"Sorry if someone has already asked this, but there are too many posts to go through. What was the message for this film? When Syndrome gave that speech about giving inventions to everyone and then nobody being super because of it I was really confused, as because of that the only message I could see was that if you aren't born with talents don't try to do anything good because only special people can accomplish their goals. Not exactly the most positive message no? I think I've totally missed the point so can someone spell the point out for me? Please? I'll give you a cyber kitten if you do! =^.^= Watch him dance! =^.^= =-.-= =>.>= =~.^= =^.^="
"This is a very enjoyable movie, with a lot of smart and interesting twists to the superhero genre. however it feels like two separate movies. The first half is more serious and is like a cross between a superhero spoof and the idea of a superhero taken as reality. The problem comes when the movie switches from being something that questioned the genre and made it more real to something that no longer takes its characters seriously. By the end this is just a ride movie, not an action movie with consistent character development and a point that people could walk away with. now, i'm not talking about a sound-byte ""Message"" that was missing, because something like that actually was there, it was just betrayed by the ending. The family of the incredibles became people with extraordinary powers rather than truly special or extraordinary people. *Spoiler* The lack of responsibility towards the villain that Mr. ""incredible"" showed disproves that he is anything other than a man with superhuman strength. He is not a hero. His ego had a part in creating the villain. syndrome had free will and choice to do what he did and it couldn't be called Mr incredible's fault, but Mr. incredible does kill him in a very cavalier manner with no attempt to capture or rehabilitate him, as a hero, incredible is supposed to be better in character than regular people. The film also treated the killing of syndrome as a joke, with that cape thing. on the one hand something like that can be considered funny in a cartoonish comic book setting but not in a world that is supposed to be taken seriously as the world of the incredibles had been set up to be. This movie had great potential and is still excellent in many respects, but it is not the great film that many critics and audiences seem to think it is."
"Bob and Ellen Parr are happily married with 3 children, but Bob is stifled in a demoralising office job. He fondly remembers the time 15 years earlier when he and Ellen were Mr Incredible and Elastigirl, successful super-heroes before too many lawsuits forced all super-heroes to retire. Then an opportunity arises to resume super-heroing and, before you know it, Bob and his entire family are in jeopardy.The Incredibles is an excellent film, with plenty of action, adventure, humour, and superheroics, and a surprising amount of James Bond-iness (including musical references). At its heart is the family relationships between the Parrs, and the threats to this are shown to be just as important as the larger and more physical threats from the villain.The animation is superb, the character design is brilliant, and the set design - particularly the island locations - is just stunning. The film is a visual treat. But the characters themselves are beautifully realised, too. The voice work is fantastic (if I had to single out anyone it would be Jason Lee, delivering a character which is funny and seriously scary at the same time) and the animation acting is always heartfelt and true.If I had one criticism - and I do - it is that the film feels a little flat during the period while depressed Bob is working at the office. But this is a minor quibble about a film which, in all other respects, is a spectacular success."
"On the face of it this may look like it is very much a film for children that will have little appeal to adults unless they are watching it with their children; this however would be a mistake as it has a good story that adults can enjoy too. Some aspects are clearly aimed at the adult viewer such as obvious references to James Bond, these are done in a way that people who don't see the reference won't get the impression that they are missing something.The film opens fifteen years ago in a world where superheroes routinely fight crime and protect the population... until the population is fed up with paying to repair all the damage they do while fighting crime. Banned from using their powers they are forced to hie their super powers and live regular lives. Back in the present Mr Incredible is working in an insurance office by day and sneaking off with his old friend Frozone to fight crime by night... while his wife Helen, formally Elastigirl believes he is just bowling. After one such outing he is contacted by the mysterious Mirage who offers him a chance to use his powers again in service of the government. He thinks he can hide this from his wife but she spots that his costume has been repaired and contacts the designer Edna 'E' Mode who tells her that not only did she repair it but also made him another. Helen goes to see her and while there learns that her husband has been captured; she must go to his rescue, accompanied by their two children who stowed away on her plane... luckily they have powers that will help rescue their father from Syndrome, his former number one fan who has gone somewhat insane and makes up for his own lack of powers with an array of gadgets.Pixar did a great job making this film, making the characters feel believable even though they are animated superheroes. The story was fairly gripping and there was a sense of danger... we were shown that Syndrome had already killed several other ""Supers"". Some parents might not be too keen on the fact that some people die, including a few in an amusing scene about the dangers of wearing a cape, none of these deaths are likely to scare children though. I would certainly recommend this film to anybody wanting to see a well made film with a good story and nothing to offend."
"Strong point: Excellent Action, surprisingly deep characters, hilarious comedyWeak Point: How in the name of all that is purple did this get a PG rating?This should be an action-comedy superhero film, not a family film. The producers should have gone the whole way and made this an action film. As it is, the film is stellar. When I finished watching it, I immediately felt invigorated and exhilarated. For the first half of the movie I could not stop laughing. For the second half, I was constantly on the edge of my seat.Its hard to decide which is more appealing, the characters, the comedy, or the action. Each of these is beautifully done, and excellently presented. The special effects and action are as thrilling as a trip with Peter Jackson. The characters emotionally deep and complex. For Director Brad Bird, this is familiar territory, and something he did very well in the Iron Giant. It defiantly carries over into this masterpiece. the film is also peppered with some of the best comedy you will ever see in a film. Bottom Line: What I've meant to say with all this yakking is: Watch this movie."
"Wonderful movie. For a moment, I forgot that I am watching a comic. Emotions looked real. Characters just fitted very well. Story is really good and animation is world class. No noise, no deviations and narration was straight to the point. Everyone in the superhero's family is given a unique power and they are given a pie of their share fighting with the baddies. All characters are balanced really well which most of the superhero movies miss. suspense about the villain really stands out. I enjoyed watching this movie. I am curious about the second part of this movie. I haven't found anything to complain. This movie deserves a 10/10."
"Wow! The cinematography, the camera angles, the action shots, the direction!!!!! This movie is ""incredible"". On top of that - its got a great story line and plot! It's even got good character development! And this is a kid's movie involving super heroes! Usually a setup for cookie cutter cardboard cut outs! I think Walt Disney would be proud of this movie. The digital technology in this not only rivaled the animation of his classics - but outdid it in some ways! Action, adventure? Try James Bond in 'Thunderball"" and Indiana Jones meets Superman! Kids will love this and so will grown ups, the true mark of an outstanding animated feature.Yes, it is a little more violent than Disney's classics. Unfortunetely, that age of innocence is gone forever. By today's standards, where car jackings don't make the news because they're so routine, this movie isn't bad. I would say 9 years old. On the other hand, I used to watch a kid's cartoon called ""Space Ghost"" whose sole attraction was that he blew up half the universe every Saturday morning.......and I was 7......So, on that score I guess parents will have to make their own call. That aside, there are no weak points in this movie: voice casting, script, cinematography, action, plot, set direction, everything is great. A really fun movie to watch. And, about as entertaining and wholesome a family movie as these things get, today."
"(Karthik Narayan) When I saw this movie rated quite high on the movie websites, I wondered why an animated picture could be given high preference as an all-time great movie. That inquisitiveness made me watch this movie more than anything else. But after watching it, I staunchly recommend it to everyone who likes classic comedy, super hero clashes and a down to earth storyline that anyone can associate themselves with.Action super hero movies have come in aplenty, mostly taken over from comics. This movie isn't the proverbial average Super-hero (oh boy, what an oxymoron). A superhero family who try to live a common man's life and suffer the consequences and the pang of not being able to save the world in time. Instead they are at home reading the newspapers, listening to the radio which alerts the world against danger which is bound to happen anyway.The family of Mr.Incredible is secluded away from the rest of the action simply because the Government wanted them to stay away from daily life; The Government poking its nose into the common man's world, so what's new about that, you might ask. Mr.Incredible isn't able to judge what is right  to save the city against the dangers or to save his family against the dangers of the city (read people). The moral of the story is trouble is always by the people and for the people. For without people, there is no trouble.In their quest to save themselves against the world, the Superheroes succumb to the temptation to save the world against the real lurking dangers that were carelessly ignored. This causes them to throw all caution to the wind and take on the dangers that were more impeding and important. Along the way, the family unites as a team and the children learn a valuable lesson in confidence and self defense mechanisms to take on the world.The villainous fan is outrageous, the practicality of a superhero living a human life is well said and the Super powers are quite staggering  especially that of the children.The theme is superb; the comic way in which the story is woven is marvelous and overall, incredible indeed! This movie is honey spread on a plate waiting to be tasted. Don't forget to take the toasted bread with you as you move on to relish it."
"7/10 - not the cult classic others make it out to be, but still fun animated fare"
"This is an incredibly entertaining film that should delight the whole family. It's filled with excitement, meta-humor, great characters, it boasts a fantastic soundtrack, and enough action to keep me coming back for more.

"Ready to become a superhero?Pixar brings to life a family with superpowers with 4 people try to cooperate.Voice talents by Holly Hunter,Samuel Jackson and Graig Nelson and here's the new jackpot"
The Incredibles is a funny and very entertaining original story about a family of superheroes. This is one of the most mature Pixar movies (if not THE most) with certain themes in the story and action and is incredibly entertaining.
