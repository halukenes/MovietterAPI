Reviews
"While perhaps not as celebrated now as some of Chaplin's later features, ""The Kid"" is an excellent achievement and a thoroughly enjoyable film. Charlie and young Jackie Coogan make an entertaining and unforgettable pair, and there is a lot of good slapstick plus a story that moves quickly and makes you want to know what will happen.  Chaplin also wrote a particularly good score for this one, and most of the time the music sets off the action very nicely.While it's a fairly simple story, this is one of Chaplin's most efficiently designed movies.  Every scene either is necessary to the plot, or is very funny for its own sake, or both.  Except for Chaplin and Coogan, most of the other characters (even frequent Chaplin leading lady Edna Purviance) are just there to advance the plot when needed, and the two leads are allowed to carry the show, which they both do extremely well.""The Kid"" is also impressive in that, while the story is a sentimental one, it strikes an ideal balance, maintaining sympathy for the characters while never overdoing it with the pathos, which Chaplin occasionally lapsed into even in some of his greatest movies.  Here, the careful balance makes the few moments of real emotion all the more effective and memorable.This is one of Chaplin's very best movies by any measure.  If you enjoy silent comedies, don't miss it."
"I've always thought there's a great beauty and poignancy to the best slapstick comedies, even unsentimental ones like Keaton's ""The General"" or Laurel and Hardy's ""Way Out West."" The latter comedy has a scene where L&H perform a soft-shoe dance; it always brings me to tears. Why? Maybe physical comedy has the same kind of effect on me as a dance performance. Both art forms are very expressive; the fact that I'm laughing doesn't dilute the emotional charge.One of many things that made Chaplin a genius was his understanding of how close slapstick is to pathos already. Why not marry the two things? That's what he did in some of his early short films, and that's what he does in this feature comedy. The Little Tramp finds an abandoned baby and raises him into boyhood. But the authorities find out and want to take little Jackie (Jackie Coogan) away. Meanwhile, the mother who abandoned him has since become a wealthy singer and doesn't know if she'll ever find out what became of him.Jackie Coogan (about five in this film), with his charming manners, his talents as a mimic and his adeptness at physical comedy, is one of the all-time great child actors. Want more evidence of Chaplin's genius? Coogan doesn't steal the film from him. This is true even though Chaplin, as producer, star and director, makes every evident attempt to spotlight the boy's talents. Coogan is even better here than he is in his own vehicles, like ""My Boy"" and ""Oliver Twist.""Chaplin's storytelling—even with the foolish sub-Dickensian plot twists, such as Jackie suddenly taking ill—deftly draws out the comedy and pathos for maximum effect. The individual scenes themselves are flawlessly constructed. The window-breaking scene, the flophouse scene, the dream sequence, the trying-to-get-rid-of-the-baby scene—they're perfect. Chaplin's celebrated pantomimic skills are examples of storytelling in themselves.Want me to criticize something? How about those thudding attempts to link the mother with Jesus? But you know, I can't even complain about that. It's too sweetly naïve. And the movie as a whole is too good to allow us to sneer at the (very) few flaws.One important note: children love this movie. Show it to them while they're young, and you'll make Chaplin fans of them. And that's better than their becoming fans of almost anything that's being peddled to them."
"Wow, is this a memorable film! It is one of the most famous silent movies ever and justifiably so. That fact that it still entertains over 80 years after it was made is quite a testimony. It is a wonderful blend of humor and drama. Charlie Chaplin's unique humor, combined with an involving storyline and strong sentimentality make this one to remember. Chaplin's humor ranges from pure slapstick to some clever stunts.The ""kid"" - Jackie Coogan - is just as memorable, maybe even more so. He is unbelievably cute, especially in those old-time clothes he wore. Watching the expressions on his face, even as a baby, are fascinating and facial expressions certainly were a trademark of the silent era.So, between Chaplin and Coogan, and a very involving story that can break your heart one minute and have you laughing out loud the next, it's an amazing piece of work. This is a very fast-paced story which lasts less than an hour.The special edition two-disc DVD has a restored version of the print so the picture is very clear, actually astounding for its age. Excellent entertainment."
"THE KID (First National Pictures, 1921), a comedy-drama written, directed and starring Charlie Chaplin (1889-1977), plays an important part his screen career. Aside from Chaplin cast opposite Marie Dressler in TILLIE'S PUNCTURED ROMANCE (1914), a Mack Sennett production hailed as the first feature length comedy, THE KID starts Chaplin with a whole new cycle of feature comedies, but releases coming once every two to three years. A comic genius who got his start in comedy shorts starting in 1914, eventually under the supervision and direction of himself, Chaplin's methods in movie making improved with each passing film. Like himself, Jackie Coogan, Chaplin's littlest co-star and title character, made such an impression with his initial performance, nearly upstaging his impresario, that he immediately found himself starring in movies on his own, becoming Hollywood's first important child star.THE KID starts off with inter-titles, ""A picture with a smile and perhaps a tear,"" followed by ""The woman whose sin was motherhood,"" titles much to the liking of a D.W. Griffith directorial tearjerker starring Lillian Gish, yet, in fact, might have seemed more logical for a Griffith film than Chaplin's, whose very name personifies comedy. A young girl (Edna Purviance) leaves a charity hospital with a baby in her arms. who turns out to be an unwed mother whose father (Carl Miller), a young artist, never returns to her life. The mother places her baby in the back of a limousine and walks away. Crooks enter the scene, stealing the car, discover the baby and place it in a trash bin in the poor district of town. Noticing the infant wrapped in a blanket, Charlie tries to pass it off to someone else, but after stumbling upon a note which reads, ""Please love and care for this orphan child,"" he decides to raise the child himself. Five years pass. The kid (whose name is believed to be John), now Charlie's adopted son and sidekick, start off each day with brand new adventures in raising money. As for the kid's mother, she's become ""a star of great prominence,"" devoting her spare time with charitable work handing out gifts to the children of poor districts, where lives the kid. The paths of the kid and his mother meet on numerous occasions, unaware of each other's identities. When the kid becomes seriously ill and in need of immediate medical attention, a middle-aged country doctor, having discovered Charlie not the boy's true father, sends for the authorities from the County Orphan Asylum to take the child away.THE KID consists of many ingredients to make this an everlasting product, especially for a silent movie made so long ago. Chaplin, who constructs his gags to perfection, has one difficult scene that comes off naturally, this being where Charlie cuts out diapers from a sheet for the infant as he's lying beside him in a miniature hammock crying out for his milk. The baby immediately stops after Charlie directs the nipple attached to a coffee pot (a substitute for a baby bottle) back into his mouth. Another classic moment, on a serious nature, is when Charlie is being held back by authorities, being forced to watch his crying ""son"" taken away from him. Charlie breaks away and goes after the truck as he's being chased by a policeman from the slanted roof-tops. The close-up where father and son tearful reunite is as touching as anything ever captured on film.Chaplin and little Jackie (billed Jack Coogan in the opening credits) display their talents as both funny characters and dramatic actors. Little Jackie is especially cute as a miniature sized Chaplin, right down to his baggy pants. Chaplin giving one of his most sensitive performances, is so convincing that it doesn't take away his screen persona as the lovable funny tramp. From this point onward, he would become less characteristic as a slapstick comedian and more agreeable as an serious actor, at the same time, adding more plot, pathos and truly great comedy routines.As much as the present showing of THE KID barely reaches the one hour mark, Chaplin includes enough gags and pathos to make it work. The dream sequence where he finds himself in Heaven surrounded by angels might appear trite and unnecessary for some, but actually makes it essential to the plot which fits into the scene that follows.THE KID, which had been unavailable for public viewing for many years, was resurrected in the 1970s in revival movie houses with a brand new and wonderful orchestral score conducted by Chaplin himself in 1971. It would be nearly another decade for many to fully get to see and appreciate this little masterpiece when distributed to video cassette in 1989 as part of the Charlie Chaplin centennial collection, double billed along with a comedy short, THE IDLE CLASS (1921). In the DVD format, the two disc set includes rare out-takes and deleted scenes. Turner Classic Movies has brought forth THE KID as part of its movie library, where it made its debut December 15, 2003, during its weekly Silent Sunday Nights, hosted by Robert Osborne, and later in March 2004 when Charlie Chaplin was selected as its ""Star of the Month.""For its age, THE KID holds up extremely well, thanks to the convincing performances of both Chaplin and Coogan. There's no doubt Jackie Coogan (1914-1984) became an overnight star with this one film. He was a natural. While the paths of Chaplin and Coogan would never meet again, on screen anyway, without them, there would never have been such a true classic from the silent screen era as THE KID. (****)"
"""The Kid"" is a powerfully emotional and wonderfully hilarious motion picture and was a tremendous breakthrough in Charlie Chaplin's oeuvre. He hadn't filled a film so fully with pathos since ""The Vagabond"" (1916), and then it was in a very limited way--subject to the confines of two reels. And, ""Sunnyside"" (1919) was a failure. The feature length of ""The Kid"" also allows Chaplin to elaborate and refine the gags, pranks and set pieces, and with the support of Jackie Coogan, it's one of his funniest comedies.The parent-child relationship has proved potential as sentimental entertainment, and, for me, not many have neared Chaplin's exploitation of that formula in ""The Kid"". The sequence where they take the kid, for a workhouse, away from the Tramp is probably the most powerful and endearing tearjerker moment in the film--or maybe of all film. In addition to Chaplin and Coogan, Edna Purviance is also quite effective in the dramatic side of the picture. Furthermore, Chaplin and cinematographer Roland Totheroh's photography had by then improved vastly over their work at Mutual, and Chaplin was already an eccentric perfectionist, but the musical score added to the 1971 release, composed by Chaplin, taken from Tchaikovsky, gives the sentimental parts its most verve.Of the slapstick, one of my favorite scenes involves the Tramp in fear of a bully. It's reminiscent of his Mutual short ""Easy Street"" (1917), which is made especially clear when the bully bends a lamppost with one punch. There are many other great moments of humorous pantomime and farce in this film. Yet, ""The Kid"" is much more than that, which makes it such a breakthrough; the slapstick fills the plot, and there is more of a developed plot here than in Chaplin's previous work. This was the beginning of the Tramp as the sympathetic, pitiful hero, as well as clown, that's so recognizable and beloved to this day.Moreover, the dream sequence is an ingenious plot device; it adds dimensionally to the narrative and asserts its themes while delaying the inevitable conclusion of the outer narrative to poignant effect. It's also funny in a silly way. It's somewhat analogous to the outer reality story, although with much ambiguity. I wasn't always sure Chaplin was making any clear point, such as with the Christ image earlier in the film, but that seems unimportant; ""The Kid"" affects the emotions and isn't especially aimed at engaging the mind. At six reels, with more sets and a developed plot, this film was already an expansion compared to Chaplin's previous work; the dream sequence satisfyingly expands the narrative depth, thus making ""The Kid"" Chaplin's first complete feature."
"It is hard to find such delightful and adorable movies these days as ""The Kid"". It is a silent movie but so rich, winning and beautiful that you don´t nead words. Chaplin and 6-year old Coogan are possibly the most charming pair I have ever seen in my life. The film succees to be nicely light and full of joy but also overwhelmingly sad and sentimental. I always get my eyes full with tears of saddness and happiness. And I really never cry in movies. And the music...its simply Oscar-level! The movie is sympathetic, full of feeling, touchingly funny moments. It is truly a masterpiece showing how extraordinary talented person Charlie Chaplin was considering this film is respectively over 80 years old! So don´t you miss it because of it´s age, don´t miss it."
"Charlie Chaplin was perhaps the most innovative auteur of the silent era and certainly the most famous. His character, the Tramp, is now a cultural icon and will forever be a symbol of poverty and travesty that was American society in the early 20th century, but something all of us can overcome.In one of his first roles with this character, he played opposite a very young Jackie Coogan, who would go on to play Uncle Fester in the cult TV series The Addams Family. Taking himself and this very talented young boy, Chaplin made a masterwork; one that he truly could call his own as he wrote, directed, starred in and composed the score for this film.Here, Chaplin feeds to one of the most basic of all human desires: to care for a child and be needed and loved by one another. The Tramp finds an abandoned baby in an alley and in order to not be caught by a policeman he takes the child in as his own. He hasn't got much but he does have love, which is more than can be said for the child's mother.Flash forward five years, and now the mother wants her son back. Circumstances arise and soon the Tramp is fighting for the right to keep his little companion. Even so, the story is thin but I believe Chaplin was going for something more deep and meaningful. This also gave him a chance to work on some different visual styles and comedic gimmicks, things not used much at the time in the movies. Using these little tricks and ideas, Chaplin creates a real persona not just for himself but also the supporting cast and involving us in the story.However, at the heart of the story are the emotions about fighting for the right to be a parent/guardian; someone the kid can look up to and sleep beside and confide in. It tugs at your heart all while making you laugh, sometimes in the same scene. This shows the work of a true genius; someone who knew what he wanted to create and the style in which he wanted to portray it."
"Is there a way to name the greatest filmmaker of all time? Probably not, to different people it's gonna be different person, so I can speak only for myself. Let me try to describe my favorite contestant for this award:
This man is the true embodiment of the ""American Dream"": Having grown up in poverty and misery and virtually without parents (without a father and with insane mother), moving to America with basically nothing but his ability to speak English (in the era of the silent movies), this man manages to establish his own film company (United Artists) and becomes one of the creators of Hollywood. He produces, directs, writes, plays the leading role and composes the music for his movies. He is the creator of the most famous movie image on the earth-the Little Tramp. As you all probably know I am talking about sir Charles Spencer Chaplin. There are attempts, sometimes I read, to make Buster Keaton candidate for the Chaplin's throne. Well, I won't comment on that for I am not familiar with Keaton's work; I grew up with Chaplin so you could say I am being biased, however I would mention only one fact here: the only time the two meet on the screen is in a Chaplin's movie ""Limelight."" I think this says a lot.Why did I choose the movie ""The Kid"" as a podium for my tribute to the great Charlie? I have to say I like all of his movies, mistake, I love all of his movies, but this one is the true purl in his work to me. I don't think of any other movie, not only Chaplin's, that made me cry, I mean really cry, and laugh, I mean really laugh, like ""The Kid."" The closest I can think of now is another Chaplin's masterpiece ""City Lights"" but unlike the later one in the former one that is only him, the tramp, and the kid; and everything is silent. Think about it: the movie making at its purest.
I don't know whether I could make my point with this review-probably not. There are not enough words to describe the respect and gratitude I feel towards Chaplin. To me he is simply the greatest filmmaker of all time."
"It's easy to call Charlie Chaplin a genius, but I'll say it once again: the man was a genius, if only at doing a certain particular kind of film. You wouldn't ever see Charlie Chaplin doing a silent horror film, or at least one like out of Germany, or even a big epic that ran Griffith lengths. His artistry was concerned with those who could just about afford the price of a ticket back in the 20s and 30s to see his films and he combined pathos that was incredible and unique in and of its spectrum of humor and compassion. Some may call films like the Kid and even City Lights sentimental, but they may miss the greater picture at work which is that any sentiment is orchestrated and (the usual kicked-around word) manipulated amid the comedic set-ups. Earned sentiment is different than faux sentimentality chucked on to the viewer, and if any case could show this distinction better it would be hard to find a better example then the Kid.As it stands even at 50 minutes, which was trimmed by Chaplin himself 50 years after its original release and including a new musical score, it's just about a perfectly told tale. It is short in either cut form but its so simple a story to tell that anything else would just likely be padding; even that 'Dreamland' sequence towards the end of the film is crucial and allows for Chaplin to let loose on a wonderful light-and-dark examination of all the major characters in the picture- now with angel wings and devil horns! What it's about, in complete basics, is that a woman leaves her baby in the backseat of a car thinking she won't be able to take care of him, and the baby winds up by chance in an alleyway the Tramp is at, and the Tramp decides to take care of him (he even names him, in one amusing aside, John). Then it cuts to 5 years later, and the two are an intrepid duo as they break and fix windows, eat lots of pancake, and the Tramp nearly gets pummeled by an ""Older Brother"" of a kid John gets in a fight with. Meanwhile, the mother is now a success, not knowing her child is somewhere- right in front of her nose.This may sound like a bit of story, but it's told briskly and without a missed beat in editing, and Chaplin's re-edit tightens it to a point where we're mostly with the Kid and the Tramp. Their scenes are everything that Chaplin wants them to be: playful, absurd, cute, and bittersweet to a degree. We know this can't exactly last, but the moment the poor maybe-sick Kid is taken away to the orphanage becomes one of the most tragic (and yet partially triumphant) sequences in the movies. It's in a case like this, where we as the audience tear up, more or less, as the Kid is being carted away crying his eyes out, and then inter-cut with Chaplin's daring dash across the roof-tops to save him, that we see the genius of comedy and tragedy combined and working off each other. This is assisted greatly throughout by child actor Jackie Coogan who may be one of the very best child actors in any film, silent or otherwise; that it's silent adds to the challenge and success of pure pantomime that without fault feels true: even a beat with the Kid playing with toys, an obviously ""cute"" bit, is great, and up for the task of playing off a quintessential clown like Chaplin.Featuring some excellent set-pieces just unto themselves (aside from Dreamland there is the fight between Chaplin and the Brother with that belly-laugh part with the repetitive brick-hit to the head, or when Tramp and the Kid stop to sleep for the night at the home and have to sneak around to try and not pay an extra coin), an absolutely beautiful musical track from Chaplin, and excellent performances from all supporting cast (including frequent Chaplin star Edna Purvivance), it's altogether an awe-inspiring feat. To see this or City Lights or Modern Times to an extent is to see ideas and character outlasting far beyond their time and place as something far more valuable to the public consciousness."
"Charlie Chaplin's study of a tramp teaming up with a street kid (the cute little Jackie Coogan) has a fine line to tread between humour and pathos, and true to what you would expect of his best work, does it superbly.  The tramp always manages to wring the hearts of his viewers and adding a little boy to the mix was the finishing touch.  Look out too for little Lita Grey in the angel sequence, who would become Chaplin's 2nd wife four years after this film was made."
"What makes a feature film different to a short? It isn't just length. After all, some of Charlie Chaplin's later shorts were as long as forty-five minutes, while The Kid is barely an hour. No, when Chaplin made his graduation to full-length features, he also strove to broaden the scope, scale and above all the dignity of his work. The Kid is not just the addition of another fifteen minutes of funny business; it is truly a turning point in Chaplin's career.The Kid begins with a bit of backstory, as a few of Chaplin's shorts do, but never before has he conceived one as professional looking as this. Here we have the opening of a drama, and yet one written and staged with such simplicity that it does not overbalance the rest of the picture, and does not leave us waiting too long to get onto the comedy. Two shots and a title card tell us that the woman in this story is the mother of an illegitimate child. A couple more shots tell us that the father is now out of her life, and revealing him to be an aspiring artist gives us an idea of why she may have been attracted to him, and why perhaps their relationship was passionate yet brief. Of course, such seriousness was the sort of thing to be lampooned in a Chaplin short, but here that wouldn't be appropriate. Instead we are eased gradually into the comedy world, but having the pair of hoodlums who steal the car slightly buffoonish characters – they are by no means laugh-out-loud funny, but they certainly don't belong in a straight dramatic setting. And throughout while the drama remains very genuine Chaplin takes care never to allow any environment to become too serious, for example having Henry Bergman turn up as a flamboyant impresario in the dressing room scene.And never before has the effort gone into directing actors been so evident in a Chaplin picture. The performances in The Kid are full of subtle gesture and timing in ensemble pieces. Edna Purviance demonstrates a good sense of dramatic realism, with a little too much melodramatic exaggeration, but still very natural by the standards of the time. And of course, little Jackie Coogan is astoundingly impressive, his movements, expressions and timings all spot-on, so much so that it almost looks impossible for a child to be acting with such apparent awareness, and he appears more like a human cartoon character. Coogan steals the picture with ease, and for once the normally egotistical Chaplin steps graciously aside.This too is an important difference with The Kid. Chaplin had always resisted anything verging on a double act, famously severing his partnership with the funny-in-his-own-right Ben Turpin back in 1915. Now however he allows his rapport with Coogan to become the main basis for gags. Notice how there are very few protracted comedy sequences in The Kid that feature Chaplin on his own. The few examples, such as the routine with the policeman's wife and the window ledge, are often hilarious and Chaplin could easily have filled the picture with such material. However, he does the bulk of the comedy in duet with Coogan, in material which is perhaps not quite as funny but also has that endearing touch to it, and Chaplin willingly sacrifices his own time in the limelight to bring this out.Today The Kid can be looked upon as the ancestor of the successful feature-length spin-off. If you look at something like the 80-minute Christmas special of The Office, it similarly broadened out the scope of the TV series by adding some serious dramatic and emotional elements, and has become recognised as a masterpiece – better than the series. By comparison The Simpsons will always be best remembered as a TV show because The Simpsons Movie just felt like an extra long episode. Chaplin's full length features however were far more than just spin-offs, and have always been revered and regarded as the most important body of his work."
"The Kid became a critically hailed international hit. A tramp (Charles Chaplin) brings up an abandoned baby (Jackie Coogan), and later loses him to his mother (Edna Purviance); but there is a happy ending.The film is a sentimental silent comedy set in the slums. The comedy is sparingly laid on, but the overall effect is much less painful than the synopsis would suggest. The production is comparatively smooth, young Coogan is sensational, and the film contains much of the quintessential Chaplin. Chaplin had difficulties getting The Kid produced. His inspiration, it is suggested was the death of his own first son, Norman Spencer Chaplin a few days after birth in 1919."
"The world's most famous tramp is back and this time he has kid sidekick! Sounds kind of gimmicky, right? But it works perfectly! Chaplin and child actor Jackie Coogan work extremely well together. Their scenes are filled with heart and you can see that they both enjoyed themselves during the making of the movie. The movie has the signature Chaplin slapstick that is guaranteed to have you in stitches, but it also has some genuinely sad and emotional moments making this movie one of Chaplin's most fondly remembered from his gigantic and legendary filmography."
"Wonderful picture mixes sentiment , drama , slapstick and pursuits in a winning combination . While walking the slums the Tramp (Charles Chaplin) meets a baby left by an unfortunate woman (Edna Purviance who played several Chaplin films) , including a note : ¨Please love and care for this orphan child¨ . He then cares for an abandoned child , as Charlie struggling to nurture the castoff illegitimate kid (Jackie Coogan who launched as the first child superstar) . The Tramp has to face nasty cops , doctors and orphanage workers who want to carry the kid to County Orphan Asylum . As events put that relationship in jeopardy .This sassy picture packs slapstick , inter-weaving gags , melodrama , opulent Victorian sensibility and a lot of laughters are guaranteed too . ¨The Kid¨ is a culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant drama that originated a great influence of wide range . Ordinary sentimentality is made available both by the balancing presence of harsh reality and Chaplin's amusing grace of pantomimic skills . The sensitive drama is set amongst garbages , flophouses , a slum world described in Erich Von Stroheim style . Being accompanied by an adequate soundtrack , as the main theme from Charles Chaplin's score is based on a theme from Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's 6th Symphony . Duo starring is frankly magnificent . As Charlot's marvelous acting as a tramp who takes home an abandoned baby . Nice acting by Jackie Cooper as streetwise orphan that launched him as major child star , and it's easy to see why . Furthermore , agreeable Edna Purviance as unlucky mother , she acted in a lot of Chaplin shorts and in A Woman of Paris: A Drama of Fate .The motion picture was masterfully directed and played by Charles Chaplin . The production company tried to cheat Charles Chaplin by paying him for this six-reel film what they would ordinarily pay him for two-reel film, about half a million dollars. Chaplin took the unassembled film out of state until they agreed to the one-and-a-half million he deserved, plus half the surplus profits on rentals, plus reversion of the film to him after five years on the rental market. Deemed to be Chaplin's first real feature but he had made many shorts such as ¨The Vagabond¨, ¨Night at the show¨, ¨Burlesque on Carmen¨, ¨The immigrant¨ and ¨The circus¨ . Chaplin subsequently would make a string of successful films such as ¨The Gold Rush¨, ¨City lights¨, ¨Modern times¨, ¨The great dictator¨, ¨Monsieur Verdoux¨ , ¨A King of New York¨ and his last movie ¨Countess from Hong Kong¨."
"The simple, lovely story of an abandoned kid and found and raised by the little tramp is executed by Chaplin with an incredible sensitive touch. I'd say that it is as much funny as sad, and the music score couldn't be more accurate.Perhaps the most delightful surprise was to ""In the dreamland"" scene. So full of symbolism and lyrically narrated, the scene made me question myself if, at the moment, I was watching Buñuel and not Chaplin. It is not my Chaplin's favorite, but it's for sure one of his bests. Totally recommend to be watched. Chaplin will never disappoint you, that's for sure. If you watch this one, also with ""City Lights"" and ""Modern Times"", you'll be ready to enjoy his talkies: ""The Great Dictator"", a classic, and the perfect, touching till tears, ""Limelight""."
"Due to an unwed mother abandoning her child in an automobile and said automobile being subsequently hijacked, The Little Tramp winds up with the baby and proceeds to raise it in its first five years.In reading Charlie Chaplin's memoirs I learned two things about the making of The Kid. First he had to get child star Jackie Coogan away from Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle under whom the lad was contracted. Chaplin saw him and was determined to make a film with him. The second thing was Chaplin's determination to make a film that combined both pathos and comedy which many said could not be done.The success of The Kid is due to the chemistry established between Chaplin and Coogan. As Chaplin said in his memoirs young children in their uninhibited way are natural actors. Part of the chemistry though is to make sure they don't totally steal the film from you.The Tramp gets his innings in with The Kid. He's the same rapscallion Tramp we all know, but The Kid showed another side of The Tramp, one of deep feeling and protectiveness. Two people who need and love each other very much. This film couldn't miss.First National Pictures sure thought so as it became part of a three way tug of war between Chaplin, the studio, and his estranged wife Mildred Harris. The Robert Downey, Jr. biographical film Chaplin illustrates that whole bit of business where Charlie smuggled out the negative of The Kid and took it on the lam across state lines. He edited it and was able to get it back to First National as a finished product on his own terms. That whole business probably would make a good movie unto itself.Till that one is made see and enjoy the Tramp and the future Uncle Fester in The Kid."
"Charlie Chaplin's first full length feature film, and his biggest success up to that date, is a remarkably heartwarming story , which makes the surprising connection between slapstick comedy and dramatic tragedy. It begins with a woman who's ""sin was motherhood,"" who gives birth to a baby she can't support at a Charity Hospital which is kept pad-locked from the inside. She is forced to abandon it in an alley, and before long Chaplin wanders by and what follows is one of the best sequences of the film, as he is casually strolling by and then, through a series of odd but entirely believable situations, he is unable to get rid of it. It is no secret that little Jackie Coogan nearly stole the show from Chaplin (who was in top form) playing the little boy at 5 years old. Charlie's life is thrown into turmoil by the unexpected arrival of the baby, but eventually he sort of organizes his life and when the kid gets a little older they make a nice living together, the boy breaking windows and Charlie selling replacements. Soon the police notice so they have to cut and run, because there are other conflicts approaching which will warrant screen time much more than how they make money. It is interesting to watch the film oscillate back and forth from Chaplin's traditional slapstick comedy and a much more developed, dramatic story. The film is interspersed with pure slapstick and some genuinely moving moments (sometimes simultaneously, if you can believe that), but overall it is a truly heartwarming tale of friendship and family and survival, and it is never once predictable, all the way until the last frame.There is a quick scene where the kid gets into a fist fight with another little boy, and in between ""rounds, "" Charlie is rubbing the kid down and congratulating him on fighting so well, and giving him hints for the rest of the fight. Meanwhile, the other kid's brother shows up, a massive oaf of a man who looks more like Frankenstein's monster than anything else. What follows is a pretty funny fight that looks startlingly similar to the fight between Charlie and the town bully in Easy Street. This is a slapstick set-up that is so simple that it could have been thrown in just to take up screen time, were it not for it's direct relevance to the story.At another point, there is pure slapstick taking place in their little shack of a home, as the 1921 version of Child Protective Services shows up to tear the young boy crying from Jackie's arms. I think this is the only time in any film that I've ever seen genuine, low-brow slapstick so seamlessly combined with a truly sad and heartbreaking incident. This combination, not just here but throughout the film, is The Kid's biggest achievement. There is a dream sequence near the end of the film that I am really not sure what to think about, although my understanding is that volumes have been written about it's symbolic meaning, both within the movie and in reference to Chaplin's personal life. And speaking of which, supposedly there were some legal issues involving money and divorce for which Chaplin sped the film stock to Utah for editing. I don't know which story to believe, that it was because of Chaplin's painful divorce or because he was unhappy with his salary (I would bet it's a little of both), but the film is here and I guess ultimately that's all that matters. In the five or six times that I've seen The Kid, I am always a little uncomfortable with that kiss that Charlie gives the kid when he finally rescues him from the back of that truck, if only because I am conscious that he is not the tramp's real son, either on screen or off. Then again, I am looking at it with 21st century eyes. Some of Shirley Temple's early films are also a little disturbing to me, although for not quite the same reasons. By this time, Chaplin was fully on the road to his career in full length feature films, and after 36 short comedies for Mack Sennett at Keystone Studios and a dozen or so more for Essanay and Vagabond (along with a few assorted others), Charlie was fast on the way to establishing himself as one of the greatest stars in the history of the cinema."
"""The Kid"" was released in 1921, at the pinnacle of the Silent era, when emotions came to screen through looks and body language, when ""we didn't need dialog, we had faces"". And if there's one film where Charlie Chaplin's face oddly illuminates the screen, it's definitely ""The Kid"". Sure, many fans would argue that ""City Lights"" is Chaplin's masterpiece but something is too perfect, too masterfully directed, it was made during the talking era, Chaplin was in his 40's and had more experience, while ""The Kid"" features a more youthful director, It belongs to a whole other era, and has the historical feel of a Mark Twain or Charles Dickens novel, which is not surprising when you consider that the movie is chronologically closer to these classics  Indeed, in 1921, Chaplin was 32, Hitchcock 22, Brando wasn't even born, discovering ""The Kid"" is like turning the pages of a dusty yellow-paged historical book, one eye is watching the film, while the other discovers a period. And I don't know if I'm the only one, but there's something in the setting, the location that makes the film look even older. For all I saw, the movie could have been set in the early century, and considering the timing of the film, maybe this feeling has been deliberately accentuated by Chaplin, himself. The film was made in a difficult personal time, when he'd just lost his son after his birth. There was a great wound in Chaplin's heart and a movie evoking childhood was the best way to exorcise his inner demons, and his discovery of a very young gifted child named Jackie Coogan the perfect encouragement.The context of ""The Kid"" is crucial to analyze and comprehend the personal motives of Chaplin beneath the simple desire to make a movie. Chaplin was a successful comedian at that time, which is even more impressive considering his seven-year experience, a short time but enough to create an icon, the Little Tramp, an immediately recognizable character that put a face in a rather young art named Cinema. Chaplin's story is also the perfect illustration of the American Dream and I'm sure that he felt privileged for having gone from a difficult childhood in a poor London district to Hollywood fame ... and maybe somewhere deeply in his heart, he felt obliged to let this part of himself having an occasion to shine, maybe he knew he was the only one who could direct himself in a more serious tone, and maybe the weight of the past was the little flame that ignited his desire to be a film-maker.""The Emigrant"" in 1917 was like the first step back into Chaplin's past, inspired by his own experience. The movie doesn't feature many emotional moments probably because the emigration carries a sort of hope for a better future, and leaving the motherland wasn't synonym of sadness, but the emotions were there, beyond the slapstick and the comedy, and waiting for another step back, to finally explode in an emotional firework, which directly transports us to Chaplin's past. He who grew up without a father, and started working at an early age, he who learned entertainment for survival more than for a living, before it cemented his talent, he needed to dedicate a film to what made Chaplin Chaplin. And this is how ""The Kid"" was made, and for the first time, Chaplin would become more than a simple clown, and get all the respect he needed from his peers, as a gifted film-maker. He could finally make his first masterpiece ""The Gold Rush"", but ""The Kid"" was this necessary last breath before taking the big dive.Many aspects of ""The Kid"" highlight Chaplin's past, and the level of pathos depicted in the introduction will disconcert many fans who expected good laughs : a woman abandons a child, expecting him to be adopted by a rich family, until funny yet hazardous circumstances put the child into the Tramp's arms. But what strikes the most is the level of maturity from Chaplin who, despite the archetypal situations, didn't make the gesture as spontaneous as it could have been, the mother of the illegitimate son is obviously devoured by guilt, as is the father, a nice-looking fellow, and a sign that Chaplin doesn't hold any grief against his father. These things happen, and we shouldn't feel sorry, as it contributed to the creation of one of the greatest early cinematic duos : the Tramp and the Kid.In every aspect, the Kid is Chaplin's alter ego : he's smart, tender, funny, sensitive and more than anything extremely convincing. We've seen so many child performances since 1921 to get a definitive opinion on what a great one is, and Jackie Coogan is one of the best, if not the best, almost stealing the show from the King of Comedy, and that the kid didn't become as much a star as Chaplin, is one of cinema's cruelest ironies. The chemistry between the two characters is genuinely authentic, and it takes its highlight at one irresistible emotional scene. I surrendered to tears when I saw the poor little kid crying, while the movie showed one of the rarest and most intense close-ups on Chaplin's face : his devastated look and his eyes suggesting an icy blueness as to incarnate the cold cruelty of a world that would allow the worst to happen, and whatever inhabits the Tramp's heart is communicated through an emotional score composed by Chaplin himself.Chaplin, like Disney for animation, handled drama with the same strength as for comedy, the necessary tears for a movie mostly made of joy, fun, cheers, and even some dreamy escapism allowing a self-reflexive approach of the magic of childhood. ""The Kid"" is not perfect, but it's a masterpiece of sincerity, of humanity that only Chaplin could have made and embodied through a magnificent music. If not his best, it's his most defining film "
"This is such a incredible movie...Along with ""City Lights"" and ""The Gold Rush"" this has to be one of the best movies starring Charles Chaplin, and it is also one of the best movies ever made.It is true that for the modern viewers, the story of this film could be way too melodramatic and dated, but personally I think it is one of the most heartwarming and captivating films ever made, and a timeless classic from the age where movies were made with heart and not only thinking only in the box-office.That doesn't mean this movie isn't entertaining: In fact, I found this movie to be way more enjoyable than many modern unfunny ""comedies"" and also way more emotional and engaging.I truly loved this film. It is one of the best movies of the story of cinema and shouldn't be forgotten."
"The opening title to this film reads ""A film with a smile - and perhaps, a tear."" Truer words about a motion picture have never been spoken, for Charlie Chaplin's ""The Kid"" has a plethora of smiles from start to finish, and yes, a few tears as well. The film tells the tale of a woman who abandons her infant son, who is eventually stumbled upon by the famous Little Tramp character, played by Chaplin. The Tramp takes the baby into his own care. Five years go by, and the Tramp and the Kid, portrayed by a young Jackie Coogan, are getting along just fine. However, a turn of events results in the two being separated, and from there the film moves on as the Tramp desperately tries to be reunited with the boy he has grown to consider his son.Charlie Chaplin is a true master of filmmaking, and this film is one of his best. His direction is truly remarkable, being able to manipulate the audience's emotions so much without sound. He is able to do more with silence than any living filmmaker could do with an insurmountable budget. He manages to make you laugh almost non-stop from start to finish, and even wind up causing you to shed a tear. It's so emotionally gripping, and you just fall in love with these characters from the get-go. Even though the Tramp may not have the best living conditions or resources to properly care for the Kid, his love and loyalty to his job of caring for the boy makes their relationship a truly beautiful piece of cinema.As emotionally wrenching this film is, it's simply hilarious. This film has some great slapstick humor, and Chaplin is a true master of it. Jackie Coogan is also great. If I had to find one flaw with the film, it would be the slightly odd and silly dream sequence, but it is symbolic of the rest of the film and I don't really mind it, despite being odd and out of tone with the rest of the film. Overall, The Kid is a film that can make you laugh out loud one minute, then tug at your heartstrings the next. It's an absolute riot, but one of the most emotionally satisfying pieces of cinema I've ever seen. And to think that Chaplin did all this without a line of dialogue, it's just incredible. And not to mention the music is just stellar too, Chaplin is a master at composition. The Kid is one of my favorite films, and anyone who has yet to see it should definitely get on that!"
"When watching this, I wanted to give the film a 7 rather than an 8, simply because I do not think it is as good as ""Modern Times"" or one or two others. However, taking into account that this is 1921 and the film technology is not all there, I will give it a little extra bump because it is so clean and well done, it could have been made a decade later and looked the same.Chaplin has to, of course, be given a lot of credit for producing, writing, directing and starring. Being a great comic actor is one thing, but being able to run your whole production takes a special skill. And young Jackie Coogan sells the picture. The film succeeds or fails depending on your casting of the kid, and they nailed it -- he's adorable, emotional, and seems able to handle any situation."
A tramp finds an abandoned kid on the street. He tries to get rid of it in Charlie Chaplin way but ends up raising it with road side values. Child becomes an apple of his eyes in a few years but the mother comes back to claim her son. I had heard that this was the best movie Charlie Chaplin made but I disagree with that statement completely. No doubt it's a fantastic movie with a very strong story and message but it's definitely not his best. I found the last scene of the movie a little contrite and compromising. The story has been adapted and tried in very many forms. Extremely sensitive and though provoking cinema. A must see for all.
"I was hardly a Chaplin fan, in fact, I loved Laurel & Hardy, and really didn't like Charlie Chaplin, until I found that I could impersonate him as a look-a-like.  Then, while viewing his films for the need of impersonating, I have become a big Charlie Chaplin fan.  His comedy mingled with pasos and pantomime was unique, and very funny; and this one is certainly one of his best.In it a six-year old Jackie Coogan makes his screen debut as a little orphan that the tramp picks up and cares for five years.  Every moment of this film is terrific, it moves along swiftly, and made me shed a tear three or few times.  Chaplin's score is undeniably a great piece of artwork, and the acting is superb; nobody in this film lacks-especially Chaplin.I recommend this film for all to see.  It's age has not diminished this little love tale for a family, in fact, it makes you realize family love even more.  You'll laugh, cry, and have a great time out.  Rent it.  Buy it. View it.  It's a film for all to see."
"There's some genuine slapstick brilliance in 'The Kid (1921)', with Chaplin bumbling about in his typical clumsy style. The comedy is marked by an innocence, not often seen anymore, that just makes you smile. The physical comedy is to an incredibly high standard and there are some some genuinely dangerous stunts, too, seen during an exciting chase sequence. There are some heart-string tugging moments as well, because this picture as a real heart to it. It's probably the most emotionally resonant of Chaplin's silent films, with a real emotional payoff. Of course the feature is dated, it is nearly a hundred years old, and there's a bizarre fantasy sequence towards the end that stands out as an odd and unnecessary aside. The piece's silent styling and heightened reality setting allows it to more-or-less totally stand the test of time and provide some honest enjoyment, though. It's an endearing and entertaining ride that definitely fulfils its opening promise of a 'smile and, perhaps, a tear.' 6/10"
"They say Chaplain is a cultural icon and all that but I'm not so sure anymore. There has been a generational discontinuity, at least in the USA, that seems to have happened about 20 or 30 years ago. I suspect that most people over the age of 40 could identify Charlie Chaplin, and most people under that age would have to stretch a bit. Just one more item in the cultural data base gurgling its way through the age structure towards extinction.Generally I disapprove of kids in movies as straightforward objects of a particularly putrid kind of manipulation, but Jackie Coogan is an exception.Sentimental manipulation there is, but it's mainly limited to one or two scenes. The comedy is pretty acerbic. Saddled with possession of an abandoned baby, Charlie holds it in his lap and sits on the curb to think about how to get rid of it. He notices a sewer grating in the gutter and lifts the lid thoughtfully for a second before glancing around and lowering it again. That's not what passes for sentimentality.Besides, Coogan is cute when he's 5 or 6 years old, a ragamuffin dressed in floppy over-sized bags of clothing, so that when he runs at high speed he looks like a little football with tiny feet on it. And the kid can act too.Charlie demonstrated every move the kid was supposed to make and Coogan did a good job of imitating him, which was all he had to do. Coogan is also refreshing when compared to all the adult actors in the film because he's too inexperienced to know how to overact. Chaplain is good too, of course. How could one person be so inventive? It's said that TV ""eats up"" talent because of the constant demand for new material. One of the better series, ""Twilight Zone,"" had about three good years of collaborative effort in it. Chaplain in the same period of time appeared in 62 films and directed something like 28 of them, and he was just getting started.I'll give one example of a joke, without an iota of sentiment in it, to illustrate how well Chaplain and Coogan worked together. Coogan gets into a street fight with another kid, a big bully, who knocks him about. Chaplain spots this, interrupts the fight, and takes Coogan to a neutral corner where he gives him a quick lesson on boxing -- go for the belly, keep your guard up -- and sends him back into the fight. At this point the bully's hugely muscular big brother swaggers over to Chaplain and says, ""If your boy beats my boy, I'm going to beat you."" Coogan begins beating hell out of the other kid, knocking him down again and again while Chaplain sweats and twitches with fear. Finally Coogan lands a tremendous blow on the bully's chin and flattens him. But he swings with such force that he himself twirls around a couple of times and falls flat on his back. Chaplain dashes over, puts his foot on the Coogan's chest to hold him down, quickly counts to ten, rushes to the befuddled bully and raises his hand -- the winner!A rather tight rein is kept on the pathos and the comic material is edgy. You'll enjoy it. Especially if you're one of those rare folks under 40 with the patience to sit through a movie in black and white that has no dialogue."
"I have seen just about all of Chaplin's feature films and I would have to say that this is the worst of them, though it does have a rather high IMDb rating and quite a reputation. For me, the problem with the film is that it doesn't even come close to the polish and quality of films made just a few years later. THE GOLD RUSH (1925) and THE CIRCUS (1928) are masterpieces, as were his next few films. They managed to combine pathos, excellent story telling and comedy. THE KID, instead, was mostly a very superficial attempt to elicit tears and pathos--while having very little comedy and a paper-thin plot.On top of these complaints, I also was amazed how ""out of left field"" his whole dream sequence was. The flying angels and neat special effects did not in any way contribute to the plot and it served more as a distraction.So, in summary, I found the film not particularly enjoyable. See any of his other features (even the much earlier and very rough TILLIE'S PUNCTURED ROMANCE) or a feature by Harold Lloyd or perhaps Keaton. Historically, this is an important film because his other features and those of Keaton and Lloyd did follow THE KID, but unless you are watching this solely for historical interest, don't."
"A picture with a smile and perhaps, a tear.That is the first line of the movie as it begins, and it stands true. We cry when the kid is being taken away from his father and we smile when they unite and share the feeling. Wow, I can't say ho much this meant to me as a father and son story. Now, we have got so many movie where a child is taken away and united finally, recent great movie is Finding Nemo. But what's special about this movie is simplicty, honesty and a rare kind of emotion that only Chaplin could bring into us.Done by the genius Chaplin, there is not a moment where we are left without a feeling, we either smile or bring tears. So to say there is never a dull moment would still be an understatement. Look for that dream scene and most of the things that we wish to do, are done there. Winning over a fight from a neighbour, meeting angels and all. Now, look at the editing in this less than an hour film, its neat and precise. The cinematography tells us the story superbly by moving camera at right pace. The music supplements at most places and yes it is great music in the context of the film. Acting is sublime by Chaplin, only few can do what he did and even today, hardly anyone can match him. It's a great movie undoubtedly and a must watch, atlas watch it before you die, you may learn something you never wanted to miss. It's 5/5 for one of the finest silent movies ever."
"004: The Kid (1921) - released 1/21/1921; viewed 7/22/05 Martial Law is declared in Ireland following Bloody Sunday. An 8.6 earthquake strikes China, leaving 180,000 dead. Bricks of wine are widely sold throughout the U.S. during Prohibition.BIRTHS: Dave Brubeck, Jack Lord, Rodger Ward.KEVIN: Finally, we come to our first Charlie Chaplin film, which was also Chaplin's first full-length feature (even at 50 minutes), and one of Chaplin's best ever. And it has little Jackie Coogan, the first full-fledged, honest-to-god child star. And what an absolutely great film it is. Every moment of this one was just wonderful. You can tell that this film meant a lot to Chaplin emotionally. And Coogan is just as cute as can be, even when he's throwing rocks at windows with his tiny arms. Another thing I noticed was that the title cards in this film were much simpler and to-the-point, unlike the cards in Griffith's films, which were always very poetic and biblical-sounding, even in Broken Blossoms, where things were as far from epic as they could be. I must also say that the DVD restoration on this film is astonishing. It literally looks brand new, like it was shot yesterday.DOUG: In 1921, silent filmmaker extraordinaire Charles Chaplin (Charlie to his fans) released his first full-length motion picture (what passed for full length in those days at 6 reels and 50 minutes), The Kid. Let me first say that the DVD restoration for this film is excellent. It looks like it was shot yesterday. You can make out every window on the buildings, every leaf on the trees. I imagine this has something to do with the fact that the film was re-edited and re-released in 1971. I do kind of wish we had checked out some of Chaplin's earlier short work leading up to this, but we still have plenty more of the Tramp to go. This film was wonderful. Jackie Coogan is simply adorable as the title character, a perfect sidekick for the Tramp. Of course the big moment in the movie is when the workers come to take the kid away to a workhouse, and the Tramp ferociously fights back and reclaims him before they can cart him away. This is an intense moment in a very light and comedic film, no doubt with roots to Chaplin's own childhood. In Intolerance we also saw workers taking a child away against a parent's will, so I wonder if this was an issue in the 10's and 20's, this thing of taking young children away from parents who were deemed ""unfit,"" to give them a ""better home."" We're rooting for the parents all the time; ""All I know is that some strange men came into my house, asked me a lot of weird questions, and then tried to take my son away!"" And hey, we get to see a glimpse of young Lita Grey, who will become important to Chaplin later...Last film viewed: Way Down East (1920). Last film chronologically: The Mark of Zorro (1920). Next film: Nosferatu, A Symphony of Horror (1922).The Movie Odyssey is an exhaustive, chronological project where we watch as many milestone films as possible, starting with D.W. Griffith's Intolerance in 1916 and working our way through, year by year, one film at a time. We also write a short review for each and every film. In this project, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the time period, the films of the era, and each film in context, while at the same time just watching a lot of great movies, most of which we never would have watched otherwise."
"Chaplin's The Kid is more of a 'normal' movie that makes points towards wealth/poorness and is interesting more like a social study, instead of a slapstick comedy.The Kid, a brilliant Jackie Coogan, is abandoned by his then poor mother, who's idea it is to leave her son in the hands of some rich people. Instead, the car in which she puts the baby is stolen and The Kid is left abandoned yet again somewhere in the streets. The Tramp just happens to walk by and decides to play the father.The movie then takes a funny turn as 'father and son' pull some schemes to earn some money, until The Kid gets ill. Then he's taken to an orphanage, but he's 'rescued' by The Tramp.New problems arise when the real mother, who now is a famous actress, wants her son back and finds out about the true identity of The Kid she met some times. But thankfully, all ends well.Movie starts out by stating: 'a picture with a smile - and perhaps, a tear' but there aren't that many funny scenes in this Chaplin. Too bad as the movie is good natured and moving at times. Although a good movie overall, not the classic many people think (IMHO).6/10."
"One of my all-time Chaplin favorite. Everybody have seen the picture of Charlie & litte Jackie Coogan. A lot of people have a poster of that, even if they never seen the film. Of course, the two make a very unforgettable pair. Chaplin presents laughs and emotions. The emotions are melodrama. I think that aspect was old-fashioned even in 1921. But I can't help it : I cry when I see Coogan crying in the truck, waving his arms to Chaplin. I think I saw that 500 times, but Chaplin's always got me! That's what I mean by a truc classic!"
"""The Kid"" makes the case that Charles Chaplin was the greatest silent movie star of all time. Now that does not disregard the excellent works of Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd, but Chaplin was the best, and, to prove the point, he had the greatest number of major screen hits: ""The Kid"" (1921), ""The Gold Rush"" (1925), ""The Circus"" (1928), ""City Lights"" (1931), ""Modern Times"" (1936), ""The Great Dictator"" (1940). And he produced, directed, wrote screenplays, composed, edited, and acted (starred). ""The Kid"" was Chaplin's first as a director. The movie begins with a title card, ""A picture with a smile - and perhaps, a tear."" An unwed mother (Edna Purviance) and entertainer ""whose sin was motherhood"" walks out of a charity hospital and abandons her baby, and Charlie Chaplin eventually happens to notice the infant wrapped inside a blanket. He tries humorously and awkwardly to pass the little tyke onto others, but just cannot succeed. So he decides to raise the baby as his own. Five years later we see a spunky kid with baggy pants (Jackie Coogan) named John."" It is obvious that Tramp's reward for his adoption is the happy presence and meaning that the Kid gives his life, despite conditions of poverty. The two are partners who work together to raise funds, which are always short. Their ""work"" consists of the energetic Kid breaking windows with rocks, with the Tramp just happening to show up as a glazier with a window replacement kit. There are a number of classic scenes: the Kid's grooming session, pancake breakfast, the bully fight, flophouse, and dream sequence. Meanwhile the Kid's real mother, who has finally made it big, has wanted her child back for some time. She is still searching. Will the three lives intermingle?The blend of comedy and pathos throughout are skillfully handled by the director. Also, there is incredible screen chemistry between Chaplin and six year-old Coogan, who made his debut. The latter stole most scenes, especially the part where the County Orphan Asylum authorities are separating him from his father. Chaplin didn't seem to mind as he and Coogan made quite a pair! The Chaplin-Coogan combination was a winning one, and Coogan's career as a child star, the first one in movie history, was launched. Chaplin himself became – not only the biggest Hollywood actor in the world – but also the most famous personality on earth. His image was recognizable in most places. The music score is very sentimental, and appropriate. The original 68-minute feature was trimmed to about 53-minutes by Chaplin in 1971."
"Charles Chaplin was born on April 16, 1889, in East Street, Walworth, London. Though his parents, both music hall entertainers, separated before his third birthday, they also raised him into the entertainment business. His first appearance on film was in 'Making a Living (1914),' a one-reel comedy released on February 2, 1914. It didn't take long for Chaplin to find his niche in the film-making industry, and his character of the Tramp  who first appeared in 'Kid Auto Races at Venice (1914)'  guaranteed his popularity and longevity in the industry. After a string of successful short films, among the most accomplished of which are 'Shoulder Arms (1918)' and 'A Dog's Life (1918),' Chaplin commenced production on his first feature-length outing with the Tramp. 'The Kid (1921)' proved an instant success, becoming the second highest-grossing film of 1921 {behind Rex Ingram's 'The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (1921)'} and ensuring another fifteen years of comedies featuring Chaplin's most enduring character.'The Kid' opens in somewhat sombre circumstances, as a struggling entertainer (Chaplin regular Edna Purviance) emerges from the hospital clasping her unwanted child. Unable, or perhaps unwilling, to care for the infant, she regretfully abandons the baby in an automobile, which is promptly hijacked by unscrupulous criminals. The car thieves discard the orphan in a garbage-strewn alleyway, at which point our humble vagrant hero comes tramping down the street. Upon his discovery of the little bundle-of-joy, Chaplin demonstrates the most practical response, and glances inquiringly upwards, both at the apartment windows through which residents like to toss their leftovers, and at the Heavens, who conceivably might have dropped a newborn from the sky. After several awkward attempts to unload the baby on somebody else, Chaplin lovingly decides to raise the kid himself, crudely fashioning the necessities of child-raising (a milk bottle, a toilet seat) from his own modest possessions. Five years on, the Kid (Jackie Coogan) has blossomed into a devoted and energetic sidekick, a partner-in-crime if you will, and it is then that Chaplin's fatherhood is placed in jeopardy.The Tramp's young co-star was the son of an actor, and Chaplin first discovered him during a vaudeville performance, when the four-year-old entertained audiences with the ""shimmy,"" a popular dance at the time. Chaplin was delighted with Coogan's natural talent for mimicry, and his ability to precisely impersonate the Tramp's unique expressions and mannerisms  becoming, in effect, a childhood version of Chaplin  was crucial to the film's success. The domestic bond exhibited by the pair is faultless in every regard, and, adding to the poignancy of their relationship, Chaplin began work on the production just days after the death of his own three-day-old newborn son, Norman Spencer Chaplin (during his short-lived marriage to child actor Mildred Harris). The mutual compassion and understanding underlying the central father-son relationship remains very touching nearly ninety years later, particularly when the pair employ their combined talents to promote the continued prolificacy of the Tramp's window-repair business. However, even during proceedings as ordinary as a pancake breakfast, that the two share a genuine affection for one another is beyond question.According to Chaplin's autobiography, actor Jack Coogan, Sr (who plays several minor roles throughout the film, including the troublesome Devil in the dream sequence) told his young son that, if he couldn't cry convincingly, he'd be sent to a workhouse for real. We can never know for certain if this was the case, but what we do know is that, during the separation sequence, young Coogan delivers one of the most heart-wrenching child performances ever committed to the screen, his hands stretched outwards in a grief-stricken plea for mercy. His performance is intercut with Chaplin grappling frantically with the authorities, his widened eyes staring directly at the camera, as though actively pleading for the audience's sympathy and assistance; it's one of the director's all-time most unforgettable moments, and first decisive instance that Chaplin was able to so seamlessly blend humour and pathos. In the 1970s, Chaplin  ever the perfectionist  re-released the film with a newly-composed score, and deleted three additional sequences involving Purviance as the orphan's mother, which might explain why the kid's father (Carl Miller) apparently serves no use to the story."
"While I don't consider The Kid Charlie Chaplin's best, along with Limelight it is his most charming and most touching film. The Kid is a wonderful film and a near-masterpiece in my opinion. If anything though I feel it could have been longer by about 5 or so minutes, but it is my only minor complaint of this film.The story is quite a sentimental one, but it is also very touching and very involving. I love the comedy which was very unique and I think holds up well, it still makes me laugh and smile. The Kid also has a lot of sentimentality and it is very strong. But it is incredibly touching too, any scene with Chaplin and Jackie Coogan makes me cry as the final scene gets to me every time. The film also moves quickly, and has many effective scenes particularly the brilliantly done dream sequence. The performances are astonishing too, Chaplin is excellent and conveys a perfect balance of sympathy and humour, but Jackie Coogan almost upstages him in one of the most adorable and heart-wrenching child performances on film. The Kid is lovely to look at too, and has a charming score.Overall, while not Charlie Chaplin's best, it is a beautiful film. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"The woman (Edna Purviance) abandons her baby in a limo with a note that reads ""Please love and care for this orphan child."" She intends to commit suicide, but changes her mind. Meanwhile the limo is stolen by thieves who dump the baby in an alley. The tramp (Charles Chaplin) finds the baby. When nobody else would take him, he discovers the note, and he decides to raise the boy (Jackie Coogan). Five years later, the woman is now a big star but her missing child still haunts her. When the authorities find out that the tramp isn't the boy's biological father, they come to take away the boy. The woman finds her note in the tramp's room, and realizes the boy is actually her's. The tramp battles to rescue the boy from the authorities.This is funny and emotional. It has the slapstick antics of Charlie Chaplin. The emotional impact comes from the kid. It doesn't get more heart wrenching than when the kid is taken by the authorities for the orphanage. I do have a minor difficulty with the heaven dream near the end. It disrupted the need to finish up the movie at that point. The only thing it achieved was to have an awkward encounter with the bully and his girlfriend. Although it has some fun with Chaplin flying around. If he actually went to heaven, then it could have ended in an interesting way. The dream explanation just fakes out the entire sequence. It's a minor problem which doesn't really detract from the overall awesomeness of the movie."
"The Kid is a comedy film about a baby abandoned by his mother (because she's single) is founed by a Tramp, in this he seems way more lovable than in the 1910's shorts. 5 Years later the boy is now helping his guardian earn a living, The kid smashes windows and The Tramp replaces the glass.That was the movie without spoilers, anyway I think if anybody finds the comedy dated then you will find an element of drama in the film namely the part where The Kid is taken away from The Tramp.To keep this short: a very well done comedy with an element of Drama (if not, according to you then this is my interpretation and that is yours)."
"The Kid is one of Chaplin's first major films. It combines elements of comedy and drama to tell a story that, even by todays standards, is highly engrossing. Charlie Chaplin plays the Tramp, a poor but sophisticated man. When he discovers a baby on the ground in the alley, he initially tries to get rid of it in a series of humorous attempts. Finally he finds a note inside its blanket, and decides to take care of it.The key factor that makes The Kid so compelling is the acting. Charlie Chaplin does his usual flawless performance, while Jackie Coogan makes a believable portrayal of the kid. If I did my math right, Coogan was only 6 years old during filming, which is phenomenal. The chemistry between the two characters is priceless. You grow to care about what happens to them, which is one of the things that makes the later parts of the film so interesting.The story uses elements of comedy and drama, and succeeds in both categories. The comedy aspects are still very effective today. Any of the fight scenes are exciting and well- planned. The dreamland sequence towards the end is pure genius. The drama aspects are also still fresh. Its probably the most emotionally touching film of its time. One of the few gripes I have is that there wasn't anything that made you want the mother to get her child back. There are obvious attempts to do this during the scenes where she breaks down thinking about the baby, but more could have been done.The Kid is very accessible even to today's audience. The mix of comedy and drama presents something that practically anyone would like. Chaplin and Coogan give charismatic performances that will make you leave with a smile."
"A beautiful film, 'The Kid' features touching performances from both Chaplin and little Jackie Coogan, as the abandoned child who the Little Tramp adopts and brings up as his own.Chaplin's first feature-length is perhaps a little light on the gags we are accustomed to, yet it fills any void with a fine sense of cinema craftsmanship and storytelling. Chaplin was more than just a master of pratfalls- he was an amazingly skilled director with a keen awareness of broader social areas. This is apparent in his sympathetic treatment of Edna Purviance's character, the unmarried single mother of Coogan who is forced to abandon the child as she does not possess the adequate financial resources to raise him with. Purviance, Chaplin's regular leading lady in his numerous comedy shorts, provides a warm and engaging performance as the woman, now wealthy, who regrets having given up her child.Coogan is absolutely amazing and lights up every scene, almost stealing the picture from Chaplin. Chaplin appears not to be too overly concerned with this, as he looks to be in complete appreciative awe of his young co-star's precocious abilities throughout.This is an incredibly moving Chaplin film with one of the Tramp's most emotive performances. Chaplin also provides a beautiful moment for early silent cinema in his creation of the dream sequence near the mind of the picture. It is beautiful, daring scene that must have taken quite a bit of time and skill to set up. Keep an eye out for Lita Grey (Chaplin's future girl-wife)as the tempting Flirtatious Angel in these scenes. Lita Grey apparently was the inspiration for the seductive Lolita in Nabokov's famous novel. I also appreciated the heart-shaped camera dissolves that are employed a few times. Also memorable are the 'boxing' scenes between Coogan and another young boy. That said, all of Chaplin's scenes with Cooper are infinitely memorable.A rewarding silent-film experience."
"Story of a Tramp (Charlie Chaplin aka The Little Tramp), who accidentally stumbles across an abandoned baby who by a strange turn of circumstance has ended up in a alleyway. Although reluctant at first the Tramp raises the Kid (Jackie Coogan) as his son and teaches him the ways of the street. All seems well until the authorities try to step in.The film is incredibly evocative for its medium (silent film) in conveying both humor (always to be expected from Chaplin) and also very effectively portraying a human drama. The scenes between the Tramp and the Kid are very touching and expressive almost from the moment they appear on screen together. The comedic set pieces for which Chaplin is best known are of course wonderful as well.The film features great performances from both Chaplin and Coogan. In addition to his performance Chaplin wrote, directed, edited and produced the film. The post production score added to the film in 1971 was also composed by Chaplin.Jackie Coogan as a result of this picture would be become one of the first recognized child stars, he would also transition successfully to character roles as an adult. He is probably best known as Uncle Fester on the original Addams Family.It should be noted for those not familiar that this is a silent picture, while there has been musical soundtrack added, the actors do not speak. There is a minimal use of title cards to set the scene or provide limited dialogue.The film again owing to the era in which it was made is only 50 minutes in length. It was very well received by audiences and would be the second highest grossing film of 1921.For those who haven't tried a silent picture or a Chaplin film this is a great introduction."
"Charlie Chaplin to this day remains one of the crowning legends of both silent filmmaking and visual comedy. His work has been known to provoke as much heart and pathos as it does laughter and smiles. However, out of all the film's he's made, The Kid might be the most heartfelt and bitterly sweet out of them all, mainly because this was a very personal film for Chaplin. Considering that he ended up getting taken away from his parents at a young age, one could only imagine how much this film meant to him. But how does it hold up today?The film focuses on Chaplin's famous Tramp after he discovers a little orphan and raises him, but then the orphanage reclaims him after the original mother finds out. Chaplin was a master at getting emotions across through strong performances, and the great acting helps establish the Tramp's relation with the boy as charmingly genuine. Whatever happens to the boy is all on the Tramp's hands, and the Tramp really is a guy who tries his best to care for the lad in spite of his impoverished lifestyle. While the ending is obvious by today's standards, the film makes you work for that ending by piling up so much drama and uncertainty throughout, succeeding well in the suspense department.The filmmaking is another added bonus, with plenty of distinct editing tricks and fast paced action to liven up the viewing experience. Even though the score was obviously recorded much later (the 1971 version is all that survives after all), it is well timed to the motion on screen, and it is quite memorable and harmonious in its own regard. It really helps when a soundtrack can make a feature come to life as much as solid acting and slapstick. My only complaint with the film is that the moment with the kid getting into a fight with a bully about his age goes on too long. While it does give the kid a good reason to defend himself, it kind of drags on too much and it doesn't even go anywhere afterwards.I can definitely see why Chaplin deemed this to be the most characteristically distinct out of all his work, since his childhood memories are all over this metaphorically. There aren't too many features that depict the bringing up of children in the poor population whilst depicting them in a positive light, so this film is a pure example of highlighting parenthood in the lower class. If you are yet to check this film out, definitely feel free to do so. Regardless if you're a parent or not, it will definitely shed a light on the pros of raising an infant."
"Charlie Chaplin will never leave you disappointed with his work, this is just an another example of it. With every minute your amazing life. Comic with a message and lovely touching story in it. I'll not spoil your interest by discussing movie scenes which I felt amazing. Watch it and see many amazing moments in it"
"This film was entertaining even in 2018. I'm not trying to take away from the art of the silent film, but many of them don't entertain today, but The Kid had a great story that proves some things never change. The physical humor still stands well and shows how many physical comedians drew inspiration from Charlie Chaplin. A true film gem."
"An Easter Egg is a hidden joke or reference in a movie, and Chaplin put one in 'The Kid'. How many of you have seen the movie and wondered why Chaplin put in a title card referring to the doctor as 'The Country Doctor'? The entire movie takes place in a city, so why should the doctor be a country doctor? The answer is this: in 1909 D.W. Griffith made a movie called 'The Country Doctor', and Chaplin was making an ironic comparison between the doctors in the two films! Griffith's film is hard-hitting, unforgettable and a superb piece of cinematic artistry. It's sentimental theme would have appealed to Chaplin, and I'm sure he was right in thinking that his audience in would remember the movie, despite the fact that it was made twelve years earlier: once seen, never forgotten! So there you have Chaplin's Easter Egg in 'The Kid'."
"Kid, The (1921) **** (out of 4) One of the greatest films to mix laughs with tears, this masterpiece has The Tramp (Charles Chaplin) taking care of a young kid (Jackie Coogan) but soon issues might tear them apart. It's well-known that Chaplin's studio wasn't fond of him going into a feature length film but thankfully he got his way because this is clearly the first masterpiece in a long line of great films. THE KID is a rather remarkable little film and one I'm always fascinated by because it's somewhat hard to believe that Chaplin was able to create such a great film in such a short running time. The film starts off with some wonderfully funny sequences including the one where our Tramp first finds the baby boy. Just take a look at this sequence and not only see how funny it is but also look at some of the black humor. There's one part where the Tramp is sitting with the baby by a drain and he opens the drain and thinks about dropping the baby down it. Another terrific moment is when we get back to the rundown home and see how the Tramp fixes up the kid's bottles. The laughs don't stop here because they get even better as we see how the Tramp and his new son make a living. Of course, the last part of the film contains the drama and man is it very powerful. Everyone knows the famous shot of Coogan on the back of the truck screaming out. This is certainly a very powerful scene but so is the look on Chaplin's face as he realizes that he might be losing his buddy. Both Chaplin and Coogan are perfect in their roles and it's rather amazing to see how much they do come across like a real-life father and on. A lot of the current versions are a shorter cut that Chaplin did in 1971 to remove footage of the mother. Film buffs will argue about which version is better but no one which one you select you're in for a great time."
"Charlie Chaplin, as the unnamed Tramp, finds an abandoned child and raises him as his own. Five years later, the child welfare organizations try to take the child (Jackie Coogan) away, while the child's mother (Edna Purviance) is still trying to find him.Chaplin's first feature is another masterpiece, and a real tearjerker. Some scenes are probably there for comic relief (such as the scene with the doctor), but some are almost sad, and Chaplin continues his streak of movies dignifying the underdog.On a side note, it's hard to believe that The Kid is played by the future Uncle Fester, but it's true."
"A sweet silent-era classic. Produced, directed by, written by and starring the greatest comedic actor of all time, Charlie Chaplin. He pretty much invented physical comedy for the silver screen, and also perfected it.It is amazing to see the creativity displayed by Chaplin in some of his sight gags. Not only to think of the scene, but also to make it and act it out. Simply astonishing some of the stuff he came up with. Plus, it all fits in with the plot of the movie. It's not just a random scene slotted in gratuitously. So many brilliant, laugh-out-loud moments. Also amazing to see what you can achieve cinematically when you don't have the ""luxury"" of sound.However, there is more to Chaplin than just comedy, and it's no more evident than in this movie. This is also a good drama, and a bitter-sweet, emotional one too."
"This was Chaplin's and one of the first full-length movie for Hollywood. Before then, most silent films were still short and quickly put out. It took nearly a year for Chaplin to finish this movie. Although this film started out as another short film, by the time it was done, Charles taken more shots and retakes than any film before as done. By completion, it had grown into a six reel feature film. The Kid is thought to be influenced by Chaplin's own childhood and what was happening at the time in his life. At the time his wife Mildred Harris was pregnant. On 1919, she gave birth to a malformed boy that die 3 days later. The event took its ton on Chaplin's personal life. It seems to have influenced Chaplin's work, as he planned a film that turned the Tramp character into the father figure of a young boy. You can see that he transmute his personal pain into something that stir people hearts. His relationship with Mildred Harris have become soured to the point, that Charlie Chaplin became afraid of her trying to steal the film from him during the divorce hearings. The film opens up with an unwed poor mother (Edna Purviance) coming out of a hospital with a baby. You can tell it's illegitimate, as in Chaplin's life, who was himself illegitimate, edits the image of the father an artist burning the photo of the woman. The woman hold the baby and walks as if Jesus holding a cross which is shot fading out. It's hard to tell what Chaplin meant with this explicit Christian symbolism, but the symbolisms returns throughout the film confusing more people. I can only sense that Chaplin was going for fragility, and transience of true moments of human love, over the sacrifice of pain. By having a halo seem to appear the mother head for a few moments, it might represent Virgin Mary. Anyways, she comes across on her self-journey seeing a bride who just got marry. The bride drops a withered flower, symbolizing her loss of virginity. By doing this, I believe it represent her sacrifice her life by marrying an old man that she does not love for money. Within a few seconds, Chaplin takes pose symbolism that commit on hypocritical American piety, puritanism, and organized religion. It's hard to make a saint out of this movie character when she gives up the kid in hope of a better life by leaving the child in a rich person's car. Instead of an rich person finding the baby, two thefts stole the car, and tossed the baby out near some trash cans. It is there, that the Tramp (Chaplin) find the baby and does everything at first to dispatch of the baby, even contemplating throwing the infant into a street grating. While it might be a bit funny, its dark humor isn't what I thought of this family movie coming in. It was a bit disturbing for the Tramp to even think that way. Anyways, the Tramp accepts fatherhood, and adopts the kid. 5 years pass, and the baby grew up as John (Jackie Coogan). John help the Tramp get work by breaking windows for him to fix. Meanwhile, the grief-stricken Edna has seen the error of her ways and leaded a life of charity. Edna and John meets when John started a fight with the local bully. It is here, that Edna believes that John is her long lost child. Soon the Tramp get into trouble too, as agents of the law figure out that the kid isn't his own and try to send the boy to an orphanage. That scene alone will get you emotional. The Tramp now has to try to find a way to keep his only love from being taken away, not only by the law, but the mother wanting to see him. The movie goes pretty good until ""Dreamland,"" sequence with angels in residence and devilish interlopers with temptation arrives in the form of 12-year old Lita Grey, whom Chaplin would marry and bitterly divorce in real life (Grey was the source of inspiration for Vladimir Nabakov's ""Lolita""). That is where it lost focus a bit. I didn't like the ending as well. In no way, should John ever be reunion with the mother who abandon him. Jackie Coogan does a great job. It's weird in a way that the actor would end up playing Uncle Fester years later on 1964's Addams Family. There are several version of this. In 1971, Chaplin, who was eager to share his work with a new generation, that he re-cut the picture, resulting in a version that was shorter. I thought the scenes he cut were very good and added a little more depth to the characters. There is a crucial 80-second scene which is missing in that version. The mother goes to a bridge and encounters something which makes her decide that she wants the child after all. Since films and soundtracks are often copyrighted separately at the time, it was hard to find the right song for the film. Chaplin wrote all of the music for his pictures and few survive over the years. The film is still riddled with age related artifacts that, even with this skillful transfer, are still present. Film grain is moderate. Black levels are sometimes weak. The gray scale is adequately balanced. Aliasing, edge enhancement and shimmering of fine details are all present and sometimes distract. The audio is 5.1 and nicely balanced. I couldn't see the lettering in my version. Overall: If you are a Chaplin fan, this movie is a must have. If you are not a fan, but are curious what all the fuss is about, this movie will let you know. Without a doubt, one of the most beautiful, moving, and tearful both in sadness and in joy, movies ever made."
"It was one of the first few movies of 'The Tramp' and what a laughter riot it is with a few brilliantly shot vignettes. The movie and the humor are timeless.An impecunious and unmarried woman deserts her just-born son to commit suicide and leaves a note with the baby asking to 'love and care for this orphaned child'. The baby is deposited in a car, which gets stolen by burglars, who eventually keep the baby next to garbage. The tramp finds the baby and despite several attempts to find the parent, he decides to take care of the boy. He makes arrangement for the boy to feed and purge. They team up to find a way to earn a living and they succeed by breaking glasses and fixing new ones. When the boy falls sick, a country doctor asks the Orphanage to come and claim the child for better treatment. The Tramp and the kid refuse to be parted and after a desperate and frenzied chase, they get back to each other. In the meanwhile, the kid's biological mother becomes a celebrated actor and the kid's father a celebrated painter. They reconcile and forgive each others' mistakes. The woman gets to know the real identity of the kid and declares a reward for those who return the kid. The kid is delivered to the woman but The Tramp, who has taken care of the boy for so long, is called up to the woman's mansion."
"Charlie Chaplin's first feature-length theatrical is one of the greatest achievements of silent era of filmmaking that paints one of the most heartfelt portrait of father-son relationship on the silver screen, presents the gifted talent at the prime of his creativity, and despite being nearly a century old classic, can still put most comedies of today to shame."
"By the time THE KID reached theaters in early 1921, Chaplin had already been a household name for years and was, by this time, to some degree taken for granted by critics. However, having spent nearly two years on a production which resulted in a completed film of six reels, it must have appeared inevitable that the comedian had made himself worthy of another evaluation. Chaplin's first feature film as a director is presented as ""A film with a laugh – and perhaps a tear"" in an opening title, and this promise is being kept throughout; quite definitely so. The film has the Tramp finding an abandoned baby, whom he eventually adopts. As a few years go by, the two of them struggle to make both ends meet, and they are forced to use some quite imaginative methods in order to survive: a brilliant sequence has the Kid breaking windows while the Tramp casually walks by as a glazier Obviously, they are frequently in trouble with the law, and the Tramp might not come across as an overwhelmingly ideal parent; at least not at first sight. However, eventually a visit from a representative of a children's home put to question who is really capable of giving the Kid love and affection when he needs it the mostHaving started out his film career doing pretty much what most of his contemporaries were doing at the time (running around and knocking down a by-passer with a brick in the head simply because he looks kind of stupid), Chaplin had undergone a truly phenomenal artistic development during his first seven years as a film-maker. Although his talent had been evident from the very start, and he had several outstanding short comedies on his credit by this time, THE KID is probably the film where his ability to convey a strong dramatic aspect within his comedy reached full maturity. The chemistry between Chaplin and child actor marvel Jackie Coogan is not only touching, but appears to be truly genuine; it actually started a trend of adopting abandoned children among film comedians for the years to follow, of which Lloyd Hamilton is one example. However, one of the reasons why Chaplin's version remains so much alive in public consciousness to this day, while most attempts at imitating him are forgotten, is that the comedian based his story on truly personal experiences and concerns. Although being far from the first time he looked back upon his tough past as a poverty-struck boy in London in order to find a setting for his films, he had never before dared to let the pain which he suffered during much of his childhood become so visibly reflected. His memory of being taken away from his mother by cold authorities as a child is an unavoidable parallel, and it has also been suggested that the film may partly reflect Chaplin's sorrow over having lost an infant child at the beginning of the production.It is true, as some contemporary critics have noted, that the film does make use some of time-typical elements which might appear dated today, such as a few scenes with the mother and certain title-cards. The structure of the film appears more predictable in some regards than later productions of Chaplin such as THE GOLD RUSH and CITY LIGHTS. However, it would be quite pointless (and unfair) to expect THE KID not to have been affected by the time during which it was made. In the years that followed, the silent film language would reach perfection, as directors both in Hollywood and the rest of the world developed ground-breaking methods to convey depth and complexity through subtle nuances. Although I believe he is not generally given the credit he deserves, Chaplin's contributions to this progression stand as incomparable in several ways. With THE KID, he set a whole new standard as to what level the genre of film comedy could be stretched. Although Roscoe Arbuckle, Mabel Normand, Mary Pickford and Max Linder had appeared in features already (which had resulted in some fine comedies, indeed), Chaplin's ability to evoke genuine concern for the Tramp and the Kid left an impact which is evident not only in the later features of other great silent comedians such as Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd and Harry Langdon, but remains visible to this day. Chaplin reached an emotional level which interacted smoothly with the comedy, forcing us to wipe our eyes even though we laughed ourselves silly some five minutes earlier. At ten years old, it was probably the first film to ever make me cryand I still do, when revisiting it."
"One of Charlie Chaplin's earliest features and first successful attempts at mixing slapstick and sentiment pairs the Little Tramp with a pint-sized alter ego (little Jackie Coogan), abandoned at birth and raised in poverty to be the spitting image of his surrogate father. The two established such a rapport that Chaplin apparently didn't mind having a child steal the film out from under him, not an easy task when working with the acknowledged king of silent comedy (notorious for his equally regal ego). The young star proved to be no less adept and resourceful at evading cops and whipping bullies, and while only half the size of his mentor was at least equally as funny. Chaplin himself was rarely more inventive, and the pathos promised in the opening title (""a comedy with a smile, and perhaps a tear"") is, mercifully, kept on a tight leash."
"The Kid represents cinema at it's finest. It has an amazing screenplay, amazing cinematography, beautiful set locations, and a story that will entertain and engage viewers of any age. What is incredibly effective about the film is how it is very much a drama as much as a comedy. The audience cares for the story's elements, and with that there are also various laughs found throughout the film. Granted, this is my first Charles Chaplin film (even though I do recognize that famous mustache!) so I am obviously going to be very impressed. I am just starting to see more silent films, so there is still much more to see. However, it is hard to imagine another silent film that will be better than The Kid, because it is pretty much perfect as any film goes."
"Chaplin's first feature length film hits all the right notes. An impeccable performance by future star Jackie Coogan, spot on choreography by Chaplin and a beautiful musical score are just a few of the multitude of features that make this film so very very brilliant! At times it made me laugh, like the hilarious scenes where The Kid breaks the windows only to have Chaplin repair them for a price and some scenes made me cry like the heartbreaking scene in which the Kid is taken away from Charlie by force. While this film is not up to the standard of some of Chaplin's other work, it is a great starting point to introduce you to him."
"What a delightful, fun, family film, if you want to enjoy a film watch ""The Kid."" Chaplin made it humorous but not silly or stupid. He brought a scent of happiness and fun to a film. Which was silent and used very few subtitles, which many silent films do (they mostly put a lot but this had few.) But it was better silent, this film wouldn't have been as good with words personally. This is my first Chaplin film and this film made me just wanna see more. Its really about Charlie Chaplin and how he finds a boy, and how he raises him and their adventures and people want to take him away, you probably get the picture. I really suggest to try it, its pure delight and fun."
"One of Chaplin's best. Chaplin's character fins an abandoned infant on the street, and with more or less willingness, take charge of him. All is going well until five year later when the kid falls ill. A ""country doctor"" (in reference to a 1909 movie) is called, and decides that the sick kid need proper attention and care. Subsequently, a rigid and horrendous orphanage director comes with an officer to take on the child. Which, of course, Chaplin tries successfully to avoid, and ends up in a workhouse. Unfortunately, the formerly desperate mother, now become a star, posted an ad to reward who would bring the kid back, and while Charlie is asleep, the workhouse manager brings the kid to the police station. All ends well as the mother is not a heartless b***ch and welcome Chaplin to her place to see the kid. End. OK, this was factual. Now for the emotional part, Chaplin fulfill this masterpiece with laughters & tears, as we are foretold from the very beginning. This movie, seen now, emphasizes the different way comedies have turn now; no long declamation, forceful words to delineates as strong feelings, just suggestion, appeal to our heart. Simplicity and efficiency in the humor as in the pathos."
"So beautiful, so ugly, so sad, so happy... there must be dozens different adjectives that describe this movie. Chaplin and Coogan are a great, unforgettable pair. In Coogan you can see little Charlie Chaplin. Little kid plays his role better than well... he's great and so is ""the big"" Chaplin as well! There's so much beauty in the story. The movie tells in a simple way a story about a little boy, a tramp and a desperate woman. In a cute Chaplin way everything has a happy end but before the happy end there's a lot of sadness... and of course also many funny scenes. I think it's amazing how Chaplin can make little things so funny. Charlie Chaplin's mimic is amazingly good, best in the world. His face can show all the feelings incredibly well and little Coogan has learned that from Chaplin. This film must be the most beautiful story about vagabond's life. Maybe Chaplin's best film! All Chaplin's films are worth of watching and especially this one! This movie shows that words are not needed in the movies... words are just disturbing the great mimic. One picture tells more than thousand words, Chaplin really shows that that's true!"
"""The Kid"" is an American live action movie from the year 1921, so this one will soon have its 100th anniversary or maybe it happened already depending on when you read my review. Of course, the big star here is Charles Chaplin. He was around the age of 30, slightly over probably when he wrote, directed and starred in this film. It is still a contender for his most known work. It has a number of six-digit ratings here on imdb, which is really a lot for a film from the black-and-white silent film days. Of course it helps how easily accesible it is nowadays. But other factors are helping as well, for example that this one is in the top100 highest rated films here on imdb. And the name Chaplin is always a crowd magnet. I had the chance to watch this film today at a theater for the very first time and I was baffled how the room (and it was a really big room) was basically packed. One reason way maybe that there was no fee, but also it was a midnight screening, so yeah, definitely something many people wanted to watch.Now let me talk about the film itself a bit. I must say I really liekd some parts while others did not do too much for me. I quite enjoyed the prologue if you want to call it that in which the Tramp (Chaplin) finds the baby and tries to get rid of it right away again. However, a pretty resilient other of another child and also a policeman won't make it easy for him. There were some moments like when the baby ends up with said woman repeatedly or also very early when Chaplin enters the picture and finds the baby, he thinks maybe somebody threw it down too like the stuff that is thrown out of the windows before that. That moment to me showed how Chaplin was really so far ahead of its time comedy-wise. This moment also could have worked nicely in a modern comedy show. I am not saying Chaplin's other comedy is dated, not at all, but it is stuff that would not really work today anymore I believe, but back then it did and as it is from back then, most of it has aged well. So I think after this prologue, the film gets slightly worse. But there are still many funny moments like how we see on several occasions that the kid turned out as chaotic as its ""dad"", but no surprise if you are being brought up by the Tramp. Still, there are also many moments that are really sweet between the two and you can see how much of a connection they had. By the way, I was pretty surprised the film moved forward so much in time this early. Usually, jumps of so many years you see only at the end as an epilogue or so. But not here. Pretty unusual. My second favorite sequence after the introduction was probably the boxing sequence. That was really hilarious from beginning to end and you could also see how much fun they had, especially the child actor. And pretty hilarious how the Tramp tries to convince the brute that the other kid won the fight, so that he himself will be spared from the massive fists of the guy. Some nice special effects there of how some bricks fall out when he punches the wall or how the lantern changes shape. Sadly, there were also sequences that didn't do too much for me. Maybe the weakest that as far as I am concerned could have been left out completely was the dream sequence with everybody having angel wings. Added nothing for me. Also the long scene with the guys from the orphanage showing up and the following car scenes were not among my favorites, but it was still better than the angel sequence I suppose.Overall, it was a good watch from beginning to end, sometimes better, sometimes slightly weaker, but never really bad, sadly also not frequently enough really good for an enthusiastic thumbs-up from me. So just a normal thumbs-up then. This is one of Chaplin's shorter long films (by imdb standards, where the cut is at 44/45 minutes), so you can watch it really quickly in under an hour, even if there are several versions out there and the longest runs for over an hour. But the one shown at the theater where I was ran for 53 minutes or so. Sadly, I must say that I found the soundtrack was sometimes a bit distracting with how it was always there and actually even very much in your face in less significant scenes and moments. It annoyed me a bit, also because the sound was really loud, but that is obviously nothing that Chaplin did wrong. On a completely different matter, I am pretty surprised Carl Miller's The Man is first credit here because there were several far more significant characters than his and he is really in it all for the comedy only. The key characters are united at the end: the Tramp, the mother and the child. The ending was really abrupt though I must say, but it worked well as it stays somewhat in the mind because it is really the very first scene where the 3 are united. All that may or may not follow afterwards is up to your imagination. I guess with the picture in the flames from the guy early on, he may not be the woman's true love. Okay finally still a few words on the cast: Coogan was not just among the most successful child actors from his generation, but managed to have a long career afterwards until his death. As for Purviance and Chaplin especially, there needs not too much to be said. Their bodies of work speak for themselves. And Miller was also fairly prolific. The outcome is a good watch all in all. If you have not seen aynnthing from Chaplin to far, this could be a good choice to get started. Go for it!"
"The Kid (1921) is not the first Charlie Chaplin film to feature the iconic Tramp character. It is, however, the first to have a detailed story that is feature length.The story is simple enough: a young woman gives up her child to a seemingly well off home, putting the infant into their car with a note. Through various shenanigans, the young child ends up with the Tramp.Years pass by, and the Tramp and the Kid are still together. Despite stark poverty, they get by with love and a little grifting. That is, until the Kid becomes ill and authorities become aware the Tramp is not the boy's legitimate father. It is during this time the boy's mother realizes that he is living with the Tramp.The story is very funny yet heartwarming too. The dream sequence really stands out. The film stands the test of time well."
"The Kid is another beautiful Charlie Chaplin film that has stood the test of time. While it may not be as polished and dazzling as some of his later works, there is a delicacy and depth on display that people of all ages can relate to.Many modern family films now stretch to two hours and beyond, with increasingly complex storylines and cluttered special effects. The Kid is a refreshingly short and simple story that both children and adults can enjoy. Not Chaplin's best work but still head and shoulders above most modern drivel.Overall rating: 71/100"
"Really enjoyed this film. It had a tremendous amount of heart and creativity. The plot was tidy, believable, and interesting. There was great chemistry between the kid and Chaplin, and every moment brought either a smile to my face or a tear to my eye. I especially enjoyed the theatrical liberties taken during ""Dreamland"" which tickled my fancy with a feather! It was beyond adorable, and the effects impressive for the time. Would watch again."
"In the beginning of this movie, I really enjoy the unique ways the scene are changed. It's fading into each other rather than just cutting into the new scene.Also, the score for this movie already has me hooked on the movie itself even before the five minute mark. The music is very good at representing the emotions you're supposed to be feeling during the movie without being able to hear what is actually going on. I love how reluctant Chaplin is to take in the baby, but when he decides to take it home you can see his facial expressions become slightly softer, as if he's starting to like the child. The ways he attempts to care for the child are very unique and pleasant to watch. By the time it gets to 5 years later, the expressions by both actors let you know that they have gotten in sync with each other and have created a routine around each other. The scene where the child is making pancakes to me, proves how good he was raised and how responsible the kid is. Next, the entire time when the child was being taken away was very emotional, both the facial expressions and the score really add to the sadness of the scene. Jumping ahead to the end, I like ho wit was not given away that the policeman was taking Chaplin to see the kid, this sort of surprise at the end made me enjoy the movie more. I typically enjoy happy endings, so I was very glad that this movie had one. Overall, I really liked this movie. I am not the biggest fan of silent movies so I was pleasantly surprised to like this one. Most of my liking comes from the level of acting, great facial expressions, and coherence with the score."
"This movie is considered one of the very finest ever made, and with good reason. Chaplin, in his Tramp character, does a masterful job of telling the story of a baby, left in a limousine by his destitute mother so that he may have a better life, who is then discovered by The Tramp and raised as his own. This is much to the chagrin of local bad boys, the cops, and what passed for Child Services in 1921. Jackie Coogan is the Kid (he'd go on to greater fame in the 1960s as Uncle Fester in The Addams Family), and man can he act. He's an adorable little waif as it is, but his expressions and motions belie his age. Plus, his interactions with Chaplin are genuine and incomparable. And then there's the choreography! In particular, there's an extended fight scene involving Coogan and an older boy, followed quickly by one with Chaplin and a top-heavy bully (the other boy's brother). Chaplin's physical prowess is amazing - think Jackie Chan today - but it's the work of all of the actors, in perfect sync, that really makes the scene click. This is a classic."
I don't have much else to say about this movie that hasn't already been said. Its really good and I recommend it. Also I wish that hats had never gone out of fashion.
"It's a rugged, filthy, hard-knock life for Charlie Chaplin's Tramp, who barely has the means to keep himself fed and under a roof at night, much less to provide for the abandoned infant he's just stumbled across in an alleyway. Circumstance has put the two together, though, and after using his brain to get through the child's early years, the Tramp's put him to work as part of a slightly-shady window replacement scheme. They aren't exactly living above the board, and the policeman always seems to stumble by at precisely the wrong moment, but they're happy and the care they have for one another shines bright despite the absence of a voice track.Chaplin, of course, was already an expert of pantomime at this stage of his career, but Jackie Coogan, the titular kid, constantly steals scenes from the star with an expressive, densely emotional performance. No surprise that he was born to a family of actors and went on to a long career in the industry (including a role as Uncle Fester in the original Addams Family TV series).A touching, inventive, effective blend of tenderness and madcap comedy that shows Chaplin's versatility as a star and as a writer/director, while getting in and out in a mere 53 minutes."
"Loved it, a real good comedy. This first success of Charles Chaplin is probably one of the best movies ever. Although short, you have enough time to be laughing and maybe cry.. Highly recommend."

Amazing movie.. genius.. this was made in 20's - still excel
"Well, this is the third Chaplin movie that I've seen, and man, the guy was really a genius. The Kid's history is beautiful and touching, alongside that classic Chaplin humor. But, I have to say, that this movie doesn't hold on that much as others, for example Shoulder Arms, that is in fact 3/4 years older than The Kid, but in my opinion is more entertaining than the former. But please, don't get me wrong, we are talking about an almost 100 years-old-movie that is still able to touch people's fellings, and this is HUGE. I love the movie, its importance, and the way it influenced cinema moving foward. The fact that isn't better than others Chaplin movies is not a demerit by any means.One thing I start to realize is that Chaplin was not only a comedy genius, but also a storyteller genius, he always try to pass some message within his movies. Talking about the ones I've seen, Shoulder Arms approaches the war, Modern Times the new ""tecnologic era"" (always with a society approach), and The Kid it's no different, it talks about family and love, but in a deep way. It's almost like what Pixar does nowadays, some can go see their movies and just have fun without think that much about it, but, others can pay more attention to the details and look deeptly at it.To wrap up, The Kid is a cute and beautiful movie, and even though isn't Chaplin greatest work, it's way above 99,9% of the movies that were release in the same time period. Obs: I can't help talking about the ""dream"" sequence. I really think that it took me out of the movie for some seconds, and, man, the ones who know Chaplin's story know that the girl he kisses ended up being his second wife, but, man... it's weird to see a 30 years something dude kissing a 12 years-old girl, even in 1921. I don't know, it's just weird."
"Almost a hundred years before All India Bakchod, India's YouTube based sketch group came to popularity and went onto make their Hotstar sponsored web exclusive called On Air with AIB with the tagline of ""Comedy mein Tragedy hain, Comedy mein Tragedy hain..."" (There is comedy in tragedy), the one of the two greatest of comedian minds I have ever witnessed, Charles Chaplin decided to observe that obvious truth and plot his entire basis of work. The fact that he is perhaps the greatest mind of his genre, time and even is considered to have made up a personal form of film-making just shows how defining his choices was. The Kid has only one flaw in the whole story which is the ending dream sequence which melds into the reality of the 'lone prospector' (that seems like perpetually Chaplin's character presentation except in The Great Dictator from what I have seen so far; I would correct myself if I see otherwise). It was jarring and snapped me out of the investment I had in the ending of the story because of what the penultimate scene shows with respect to the kid not being an orphan anymore and how it is resolved. Otherwise, it is pretty much another masterclass. The kid who plays The Kid is at times somehow a better act to observe than even Chaplin himself, who is more fatherly despite how clownish ways which makes it all an odd enjoyment.The highlight of the movie is definitely a quarter of the film in when the kid and his 'father' are all tucked into the daily way of life, going about their jobs breaking and repairing things, eating their home-cooked meals and winning fights against stronger strangers in surprising and ridiculous ways. To sum this story, it is about choice, love, loss and parenthood's absolute joy should you choose to accept it, making Life a little more bearable than it was before that choice changed your perspective on it."
"What a wonderful story by Charlie Chaplin.In it, a poor, young mother gives up her newborn in a car in front of a mansion. Through a series of unlikely events, the young child ends up in the care of the Tramp. After a few funny attempts to rid himself of the child, he finally accepts his role as caretaker, naming his adopted son John.A few years pass, and the two make a wonderful duo - scheming and scamming people together in hilarious ways. But things take an unexpected turn for the worse when John becomes ill.I can't speak of this film highly enough. The performances of all the actors involved are wonderful. A young Jackie Coogan plays John and does so brilliantly, I can not name a finer child actor. Most child actors are sub-par, if not whiny and annoying. This film will make you laugh, cry and most importantly, think."
"I will begin this review by giving a brief plot summary so you, the reader, have an impression of the goings on in the film if you haven't yet seen it. The film begins with a mother and her infant child. Very early on in the film the mother decides that she simply cannot care for the child, so she abandons it in the rear seat of an unoccupied car. The unoccupied car then because the partially unoccupied car and is subsequently stolen by car thieves. The thieves eventually take notice of the small child in the back seat and, in turn, they abandon it themselves in an alleyway. In this alley is where the iconic figure of Charlie Chaplin's Tramp character is presented and he eventually finds that he will have to be the one to care for the infant. 
Time lapses five years into the future and we find Chaplin and the child, which can now more accurately be referred to as a ""kid"", living together in a raggedy one bedroomed apartment. Chaplin's tramp is clearly presented as a surrogate father figure for the kid, and the two of them appear to coexist in a relationship that is both playful and loving. The rest of the movie unfolds after the stage is set as I just did for you. It is mostly instances of how the two paupers have to swindle there way into sources of income, and the misadventures that come along with it.
The film was released in the year 1921. Releasing a film in this time period could be considered overly restricting by some individuals, considering that ""talkies"" had yet to be a staple of the medium. However, Chaplin absolutely encapsulates the melodrama of the story and expertly enables the story to be told through movement and design, rather than through dialogue. 
Chaplin's tramp character is the iconic image of Charlie Chaplin that everybody knows even if they have never seen one of his movies. Every aspect of the character from his attire (bowler hat, cane, small waist coat, large trousers and shoes) to his over exaggerated gestures make for an expressive performance that is both memorable and inevitably iconic. It is worth noting the charismatic performance of the kid as well. He is an excited young man that is clearly enjoying himself in the filmmaking process, and his relationship with Chaplin is quite endearing. 
 The Kid is an exciting display of creativity that translates into iconic film. A scene that stands out is one in which Chaplin's tramp character is being chased along rooftops by a police officer, and another would be a dream sequence where characters throughout the streets have angel wings that can be purchased at a corner store. It is worth noting the impression that this film must have made upon audiences when it was first released. Even in modern times it comes across and a piece of utterly unique cinema, which is a testament to the acting and filmmaking genius that Charlie Chaplin had. I cannot recommend this movie enough to anyone that is interested in the history and progression of filmmaking as an art, or anyone that wants to lose themselves in a charming story about a man and his kid."
"The Kid, in short, is about The Tramp's exploits as a father figure to an orphaned boy that he first tries to get rid of.What I think about The Kid is mostly good. The Tramp is, of course, Charlie Chaplin, one of the biggest movie stars of the time. The film is touted as being ""6 reels of joy"" in 1920's parlance. Today, it would be known more as a ""film for the whole family"" (rarely is a movie presented on film reels nowadays). Out for a stroll one day, The Tramp spots a baby that is nearly hurt by some debris being thrown out of a window. The Tramp rescues the boy but then tries his best to unload the child anywhere he can, however an annoying, seemingly omnipresent flat-foot quashes any ideas that come to mind. So, The Tramp takes in the boy and raises the child as his own after reading a note the mother left tucked inside his nappy. We play witness to The Tramp trying his best to raise the boy while still being a virtual vagabond. He teaches The Kid the family business and other nefarious undertakings they need to survive this cruel world. Hilarity ensues.I'm always amazed at how silent film actors can get their message across without a voice to carry it. This movie has a newly-scored background, and only a few title cards to help the viewer understand where it's at. It's all enjoyable acting to watch, even if it's mostly slapstick humor we're laughing at. Jackie Coogan, billed as The Child, is The Kid of whom we're speaking. He really is quite adorable and can surprisingly act. Overall, this is a pleasant family film, and most will enjoy it. Maybe even your own kid will like it.Two things you'll LIKE: 1) It's simple in its presentation, but still magical in a sense. Special effects, 1920's style! 2) It's the perfect length.Two things you'll DISLIKE: 1) After years of watching widescreen, HD and 4K films having never seen a single foot of actual film, the 1.37:1 aspect ratio (think of a square), and not clear-as-crystal 35mm film, may be jarring to watch at first. 2) Slapstick comedy: does it still work?"
"Today, Charlie Chaplin is known primarily and exclusively for his silent, slapstick humor, but one mustn't forget that he was also a master at tearjerking drama. The Kid is perhaps the finest example of the classic comedy master's ability to tug at our heartstrings. The Kid is a film that is only about sixty minutes in length, and yet it has far more dramatic impact than most films that are twice as long! Although I seem to only be acknowledging the film's more emotional qualities, there is also no doubting that The Kid is also an extremely funny movie, possibly even among the funniest films ever made. Even within this tale of melancholy, Chaplin is able to inject some of his most clever and creative slapstick routines. With the help of child co star Jackie Coogan, Chaplin is able to get laughs that will please almost anyone's sense of humor, from the infantile to the elderly. Jack Coogan in particular has surprisingly solid comedic ability and timing, despite his obvious young age. The image of Chaplin picking up Coogan by his overalls as Coogan is in the midst of a fight is just precious, because of Coogan's reluctance to stop fighting. Instead of calming down and succumbing to his father's orders, he wiggles around vigorously, throwing out useless punches and kicks. Chaplin's ability to fairly balance extreme emotions is the stuff of cinematic legend. As the famous title card so accurately describes: The Kid is ""A picture with a smile-and perhaps, a tear."""
"As with every other Chaplin film, this has good story telling, a good start to it, great pacing, hilarious footage and above all, a great contagious ability to communicate emotion and sensitivity with a positive moral.Philosophically one of the best elements of such Chaplins is how he'll downplay what is usually considered pitiful or dramatic; he'll make any desolate condition into something very ordinary and really not so bad while attracting the attention on more important and essential things in life, love being at center and the common denominator of those things. He'll make material decrepitude and a very low social status look funny and a simple fact of daily existence, while developing a strong sentimental bond in the plot between himself and one of the other characters: basically you can be a bum, wear one shoe, and eat dirt all day while living in a can, but that takes nothing away from the subtle humanity you'll always carry with you anywhere or your full, profound ability to love. And wrap this up with hilarious content from start to finish, and you've got a unique winning formula."
"No more Words to say about the greatness of this movie.I SEE IT DAILY At least ONCE ON MY MOBILE PHONE.EXCELLENT COMBINATION OF FUN AND TEARS. A Must Watch!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Movie Title: THE KID [1921] Director & Writer: Charles Chaplin Starring: Edna Purviance, Jackie Coogan and Charles Chaplin"
