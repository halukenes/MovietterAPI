"I thought Billy Crystal and John Goodman were great. I like them anyway, but I can't imagine anyone else in their roles. John Goodman comes across as a warm, fuzzy teddy bear type in so many of his roles, and this time he was actually drawn that way. Crystal and Goodman were great together, even when their characters showed signs of not getting along. And Boo sounded so natural, so childlike. There's no way an adult could have done her lines the way they were executed.And the writing was so intelligent, this movie was not just for kids. There were a lot of clever jokes that kids might not get. Still, the warm and fuzzy qualities of so many of the monsters make this a perfect choice for kids as well as adults, and I really don't get why ABC couldn't give this a TV-G rating. It may have been a little violent or scary at times, but never all that intense. Kids see worse on Saturday morning."
"While monsters in the closet may seem to be a scary reality for some children, `Monsters, Inc.' makes it light hearted by showing them it's all in a night's work.  The characters are as charming as the cast that speaks for them.It's a learning experience children get to see how an industry works. Monsters, Inc. is an in-genius corporation that has scientifically learned how to channel children's screams into energy that is used for electrical power.  It has monster employees, an assembly line of doors (which give monsters access to children's bedrooms), a top-flight training program and some of the top Monsters in the scaring business.There's a colorful Metropolis, filled with houses, buildings, businesses, cars and everything that makes a city run smoothly along with a population of colorful creatures.  One of the colorful groups of creatures is the yellow swat team.  Their job is to protect the Metropolis of Monsters, Inc. from human contamination.But what happens when a human child mysteriously gets through the bedroom door and terrorizes the city with screams and boo's.  It's wondrous and funny.  In the mist of all this is industrial crime, brought on by greed. But, the story ends on a very happy note.John Goodman is the voice of `Sulley' a colorful large blue-green ape like monster who's the star Monsters, Inc. employee.  He's some type of monster, cut, cuddly, and he has a conscience that leads him to feelings of regret about scarring children.  He becomes attached to Boo (voice of Mary Gibbs) a cute, little big-eyed girl who is mysteriously brought to Monsters, Inc. and in his quest to return her home becomes very attached to her.Sulley's best friend is Mike (voice of Billy Crystal) who's a funny looking green ball with stick legs and one huge eye.  His comedy is seen through out the movie.  Mike is Sulley's driving force, acting as his agent.  Mike's job is to make sure Sulley remains the top Monsters, Inc. employee. But when it comes to laughter Mike proves he's on top.Mike's girl friend Celia (voice of Jennifer Tilley) is the stylish employee who has Mike's best interest at heart.  Her job is to keep him out of trouble.I give Monsters, Inc. a ten.  It is an animated movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family.  It makes for great family fun."
"Monsters, Inc.We were all, at one time, scared of monsters under the bed. Shadows of clothes in the closet. Weird sounds outside in the trees. I remember thinking there were all kinds of monsters in my room - not as much under my bed as in the closet. And once again, Pixar, who brought us ""Toy Story"" 1 & 2, plays on both adults' memories and children's dreams, making it equally enjoyable for both children and adults.John Goodman voices James P. Sullivan, known as ""Sulley"" to friends. He is a big, blue, hairy monster with horns on his head and hands the size of a watermelon. Billy Crystal is Mike Wazowski, his wisecracking, one-eyed best friend. Both of these monsters live in Monstropolis, a world where monsters roam freely. Their city is powered by a rare source of power - children's screams. That is where Monsters, Incorporated comes in. At Monsters, Inc., monsters like Sulley and Mike open portals into children's rooms - through closet doors - and scare the children, capturing their scream in a little yellow bottle. Sulley is the top-scarer, bringing in the most scares. But Randall (the always enjoyable - even when animated - Steve Buscemi), a wormy, multiple-armed lizard-monster with the ability to change appearances to its surroundings, is jealous of Sulley, and will attempt anything to get more scares...even if it means taking a child from the real world and bringing it into Monstropolis. But after the child escapes, Sulley and Mike reluctantly look after it, all the while trying to get it back to the real world before Mr. Waternoose (the late James Coburn) and others find out about the incident...""Monsters, Inc."" does for monsters what ""Toy Story"" did for toys. Pixar once again not only expands our mind, but our very worlds. I respect their company and commitment values very much, as you can read in my ""Toy Story"" review. They stick to the values that made Disney films so family-friendly back in the fifties and sixties: Respect for the audience, respect for quality, and respect for the audience's INTELLIGENCE, something Disney, who has recently coughed up a bunch of lousy, thoughtless sequels, has forgotten. Now, I know that LEGALLY Disney is co-creator of ""Toy Story"" and ""Monsters, Inc.,"" but they really are not. They just give Pixar the money and get their name branded on the front box of the film. And even then, I have heard multiple claims that Disney is very mean-spirited towards Pixar (read into sequel trouble for ""Toy Story 3"") and gives them the bare minimum.But that is straying off the subject. ""Monsters, Inc."" is one of the most enjoyable animated films I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. I didn't enjoy it as much the first time, but I then bought it, and have since watched it many times. It is an instant classic. I will be watching it years from now, when I am old and frail and in a rocking chair. It ranks right up there with ""Toy Story"" 1 & 2, and all the OLDER Disney films from the 50's-70's. It has all the elements of a sweet, charming, emotional and pleasurably good-natured animated film. And, more coudos to Pixar: Thank you for not packing it full of the language and inappropriate content that Disney shoves into the dark recesses of their films nowadays.Not only has Pixar brought back the ""Family Film"" genre to what it should be, but it also redefines it. Pixar's animated films are some of the most thoughtful, imaginative and enjoyable animated films ever - not to mention 100 % family safe. Thank you, Pixar, for getting back on track.5/5 stars"
"You may admire the hair detail on Sully the Yeti's arm, but you will be amazed at the warmth of characterization in `Monsters, Inc.,' surpassing even the great `Shrek' earlier this year. Goodman and Crystal are a comedic team reminiscent of the zaniest Martin and Lewis days. Crystal's Borscht-belt routines brought smiles even to this jaded and admittedly tough-on-comedy critic.  I thought Eddie Murphy's donkey in `Shrek' was smart and funny; Crystal's one-eyed monster is even better with its wry and annoying wit.Cleaning the environment of child contamination is a hilarious conceit that turns around the usual fears children have of monsters in closets.  It is also a chilling parallel to the challenge of removing anthrax from today's letters. Generally, the allegorical underpinnings of animation are natural for the medium, powerful like the images of the novel `Animal Farm' for political and sociological levels of meaning.  For example, the endless-door motif in this film is an ingenious metaphor for the scary and glorious possibilities the present and future hold for kids.Even before you see this feature, Pixar offers the short feature `For the Birds' -- a brilliant takeoff on Hitchcock's memorable film besides being a great commentary on diversity. The expressions around the animated eyes, as the little birds deal with the big bird interloper, are more expressive than those of most contemporary film actors, with the exception of Brando, Pacino, Depp, and Streep.The short trailer for `Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones' may precede the showing as it did ours for an added delight.`Monsters, Inc.' is the best animated feature this year and one of the greatest of all time."
"The best way to describe this movie in one word is; fun! ""Monsters, Inc."" is a movie you can easily fall in love with. It has some great fun character, some awesome moments and some well placed comical moments. ""Monsters, Inc."" is entertainment at its bests.The voice cast is amazing. John Goodman and Billy Crystal form a great leading duo. Steve Buscemi is a great villain and James Coburn has a great voice that fits his character perfectly. John Ratzenberger as always is very entertaining this time in a role as banished Yeti.The story itself is pretty simple but thats what makes it easy to follow and so much fun to watch. The movie not only knows how to entertaining but also knows how and when to emote. The combination of fun and emotional things is perfectly balanced and placed within the movie.There is some great dialog but the true power of ""Monsters, Inc."" are the wonderful characters. Not is there only a wild variety of strange and weird characters but also some characters that are good for some serious laughs and Boo is simply adorable and a pretty fair representation of a kid in real life. Well done Pixar!Pure entertainment for the entire family!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"Pixar is the best! Of them all, Monsters, Inc. takes the cake. The realism of the characters' movements & feelings is perfect. The ending is a tear jerker on a happy note. At first I was concerned with the plot of monsters scaring children with a ""business as usual"" attitude, but right away you discover that the monsters are as terrified of the kids as the kids are of monsters.... wonderful juxtaposition throughout the film... a totally enjoyable, feel-good story. Buy it for the kids and let them watch it over and over. (adults may want to sit-in on more than one occasion themselves). Personal Note: For me, a mystery about this film was ""Roz""; the voice reminded me so strongly of the grandmother in ""Dinosaurs"", and I thought the character drawing was similar as well; upon researching the two, I found they are definitely different actors."
"MONSTERS, INC. (2001) **** (Voices of: Billy Crystal, John Goodman, James Coburn, Jennifer Tilly, Steve Buscemi, Mary Gibbs, Bonnie Hunt, Bob Peterson, John Ratzenberger, Frank Oz, Steve Susskind, Jeff Pidgeon, Sam ""Penguin"" Black, Daniel R. Gerson. (Dir: Peter Docter/Co-directors: David Silverman, Lee Unkrich)There's something undeniably magical about a Disney movie that brings out your inner child and the streak continues to manifest itself in the latest with its fine track record with upstarts Pixar (the ""Toy Story "" films) in delighting children of all ages in one of the year's funniest (and most fun) films.The childhood phenomena of imagining monsters lurking in one's bedroom closet or under the bed is in actuality a reality that exists solely for the world of the monsters to use all the energy extracted from a child's screams as their natural resource to power their communities and subsist in their parallel universe. Specifically Scream Heat (""We Scare Because We Care""), the corporate entity that harnesses the youngsters' reactions to its hard-working crew of creatures including our heroes James P. ""Sulley"" Sullivan (marvelously voiced by Goodman) and his best buddy Mike Wazowski (ditto Crystal). Sulley is a bear-like, blue and purple hairy and horned monster and Mike is a cyclopean lime green M&M clone. The two couldn't be more different yet both share their passion for their vocation and the only thing getting in their way is their rival colleague Randall Boggs (Buscemi, at his oiliest menacing), a reptilian nasty who wants to beat Sulley for the all-time factory record of most points racked up in a single day on the job  at any cost. Watching the proceedings is Sulley's father-figure boss Henry J. Waternoose (Coburn) – a cross between a crab and Edward G. Robinson – whose main priority is avoiding any ""rolling blackouts"" (in one of the film's subtle jabs at the current climate in our nation). Mike is in love with cutie pie receptionist Celia (Tilly) who also sports one eye and is afoot taller than him, with a hairdo sporting a Medusa twist (snakes sit atop her head) who wants something from him besides excuses to their frequently put-upon dates together. One day after work Sulley accidentally lets into their world a tiny 4 year old girl – a big no-no – legend has it that one touch is toxic and fatal! – which causes mass havoc wreaked upon the populace as the authorities attempt to corral the tyke while decontaminating the infected workshop's workers (a running gag has the SWAT like DEA agents popping in at a moment's notice whenever a sign of human contact – i.e. a small cotton white sock attached to an unsuspecting monster – makes its ugly presence known!) Mike is in a panicky sweat that they will lose their jobs and tells Sulley he can't hide Boo (the nickname the big guy dubs the adorable tot) and they must return her to her bedroom. Easier said than done when Randall gets wind of the partners abetting the unsuspecting crime and he too has his plans to use Boo for his own selfish endeavorsat any cost! The film is a laugh a minute romp and an incredible mix of state-of-the-art computer generated dynamics that truly enhance the candy-colored world of Mike & Sulley with its picture perfect depictions of moveable hair (see how Sulley's locks sway to and fro so naturally! A first for CGI imagery!) and expressiveness given to the one-eyed Mike who works his brow into a real sweat. Never before has voice talent been so perfectly matched and acted to a t than in the comic team of Crystal and Goodman with their characteristics smartly enhanced into their characters with Crystal's liberal use of his ""SNL"" Willy the Masochist (""Oh I hate when that happens!"") and Goodman's burly, awshucks demeanor fits his soft-hearted meanie like a golden glove. Sulley is the true star of the show with his emotional overload not unlike a kid learning to make a new life transition as he discovers there's more to his existence than meets the eye (same for Mike; pun intended). When he realizes that Boo (by the way, nice job by the producers to use real-life 4 year old Gibbs, in easily the cutest turn by a child performer ever without making an audience gag) is not threatened by his hulking presence. The laughs are largely thanks to Crystal's myopic M&M who is always one-step behind his behemoth buddy and slow on the uptake as the plot proceeds with his sly one-liners, sudden bursts of unrestrained anger and confusion, and slapstick antics leads the film into uncharted territories of hysterical laughter and a great breakneck roller-coaster ride with Mike & Sulley attempting to find Boo's bedroom door with Randall in hot pursuit gives the film a giddy headrush of adrenaline. The film is witty, bright, upbeat and has its shares of incisiveness (I loved the use of HarryHausen's as a local chic eatery that all the monsters are dying to get into; in case of those who don't know Harryhausen, Ray Harryhausen, is the premier stop-motion animator pioneer who gave life to scores of sci-fi creatures including the fabled ""Sinbad"" flicks of the 1960s and 1970s among others) that will undoubtedly have its constituents clamoring for a sequel pronto. Arguably one of the best films and funniest of the year; I loved it and so will you (and your kids if you have any; if not all the more to see it again) An instant classic."
"""Monsters Inc"" came out on DVD this week, and now I have my own copy!! It is not very useful to try to evaluate this one against others since such an evaluation is so subjective. But I put it in the same superb category that such animated films as ""Toy Story"", ""A Bug's Life"", ""Shrek"", and ""Disney's Tarzan"" are in. First, the quality of the animation and the picture quality. Unbelievably good. I can categorically say it is the best picture quality I have seen on DVD, and the movement and facial expressions of the animated characters makes it almost feel like they are real. Second, the story. How inventive! The only thing separating the monster world from the real world are the doors. The company, Monsters Inc, must have millions of them in inventory, computerized for quick call-up to send in a monster to get screams and charge up their energy cells.The main characters are voiced by John Goodman (big, blue, hairy ""kitty"" with purple spots) and Billy Crystal (short, green, one-eyed monster) and their acting add so much. Plus the great music provided by Randy Newman. Overall an hour and a half of pure edge of your seat entertainment. And that doesn't even include the 3+ hours of extras on the second disk. You can select either standard or widescreen format, and I watched mine widescreen on a 16:9 HDTV with 5-channel surround system with powered subwoofer. Almost like being in a theater!!"
"Until now I couldn't bring myself to believe that computer animation was the equal of either stop motion animation or hand-drawn animation.  All computer animated films looked a little (usually more than a little) too sterile, many were animated poorly (""Antz"", ""Shrek"", ""Final Fantasy""), and even the single unqualified success (""Toy Story 2"") provided little evidence that a computer animated film COULD reach the heights other kinds of animation could.  ""Toy Story 2"" had flawless character animation, but nothing as inspired as the best in ""Tarzan"" (released the same year, although I could have chosen almost any other Disney cartoon to make my point); effective art direction, but nothing to match ""Fantasia"" or ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"".  And I thought that ""Toy Story 2"" was as good as the art was ever going to get.I was wrong.  This is far better.  And what's more, there's no sense whatever that the script (an unusually rich and uninhibited script) is bumping up against the limits of what the medium will allow.  It's now been proven that computer animation CAN be just as good as any other kind. Whether it will be allowed to be in future is another question, but for now, I'm hopeful.  What we have here is computer animation's first ENTIRELY unalloyed artistic delight, with every character gracefully and characteristically animated, every virtual set just right and pleasing to look at, and an eye-tickling mastery of colour, light and shade that I thought would forever elude CGI artists.It's not fair to judge anything good as ""Monsters, Inc."" as though it were a children's movie, but I can't resist comparing it with ""Shrek"" - which emphatically IS a children's movie.  ""Monsters, inc."" is admittedly ABOUT children, in a sort of a way.  The inhabitants of Monstropolis rely on children's screams for their energy, and the central story is kicked off when one of the monsters accidentally brings a small child (which he calls ""Boo"") into the city.  But we never see things from her point of view.  We see things from the point of view of the monsters, who are all adults - and who, like most adults, see children as frightening, almost incomprehensible members of another species.  And they ARE.  To be sure, Wazowski comes to feel strong affection for Boo, but she never becomes more than a humanoid pet (which is not to demean the relationship).  This is a story about adults looking at childhood from the outside.""Shrek"", of course, is a children's movie through and through.  Its attention span is short, it has an unthinking mean streak, and children will have a whale of a time watching the central characters (the bigger they are, the more fun it is) act childishly and make poo-poo jokes.  ""Monsters, Inc."" has too much genuine wit, characters too rich, a world with too much depth, and a story at once too coherent and too complicated, to be PRIMARILY a film for children.  This is not to say children won't like it.  Maybe they will. (Who can say?)  Here's the bonus: if they DO like it, it will (unlike ""Shrek"") actually have a beneficial effect.  It will make them less frightened of the dark."
"This is a very entertaining animated film. I've seen it twice and enjoyed even more the second time. Billy Crystal said he enjoyed making this film as much as any film he's ever done, so that's a good testimony that you'll get some laughs and enjoy this movie as an adult, too. Kids will love it, I am sure. The ""monsters"" in here are funny-looking and almost lovable, nothing that would scare your kids (or you). Crystal has a bunch of funny lines but overall I found this to be as much if not more of a human interest story than a comedy. There is a lot of sentimentality to it, even overdone a bit at the end, but that's okay. There is absolutely nothing offensive in here, either. The colors look spectacular, too."
"There's A Monster in My Closet!I would definitely recommend Monster's Inc. to people of various ages. Not only would I recommend this movie for its endless comedic scenes, but also because of its refreshing story line. The combination of these two elements makes this film relatable to everyone for we seem to seek for movies that allow us to express amusement or for a new plot. Furthermore, the unique characters added to the overall appearance of the film.I watched the film Monster's Inc. at the comfort of my own home on Saturday, November 13th, 2005 at approximately five o'clock in the afternoon as I listed my twenty dialectics and worked on my Film Reflection Journal.I recommend Monster's Inc. to anyone for it contained many comedic parts. I believe that people of all ages would relate to this film because it achieved to have both humor for children and adults. It has the simple amusing scenes that children would laugh at for example when Sully gets stuck in the trash can and books fall on his head and there were also the new generation, hilarious scenes that adults would get such as the scene with the Abominable snowman. Its story line was another factor that would make everyone admires the movie. It was unique in the sense that everything that happened in the film was nothing like any other movies that I have seen. The beginning started out with Mike and Sully doing their regular routine of getting up, greeting everyone monster they pass by, and going to work where they would scare children for the sake of Monstropolis. Then a child from the human world comes into their lives, which will eventually affect the city of Monstropolis including theirs.The characters in the film were made for the purpose of having the audience see a whole different side of them rather than focusing on their appearances. People could relate to the characters for they showcased personalities that we would display. They showed traits like jealousy, greediness, love, caring, confidence, anger, and more. Being able to relate to these characters allows us to become more attached to the movie for we see ourselves in the figures that are in the screen. We tend to remember some parts of our lives when something similar occurs in the movie. The last parts of the film showed Sully and Mike getting chased by Randall, who was attempting to capture Boo. I remembered my aunts chasing my cousins and me as we rode around with tricycles in the Philippines. This brought back memories from when this happened to me.In my opinion, I think that the movie would relate more to children than adults for some reasons. First, the characters were full of life and animated, which would suit the likings of children. It included a lonely but friendly Abominable snowman who wanted to be accepted. Secondly, the character of Boo speaks for every child who watched the film. There were probably some children who felt the same way that Boo did and possibly even have dealt with a similar problem. I know that I related with Boo because she brought me back to my past time when I had dilemmas with monsters at night. If I could relate to Boo, I know that other children will as well. The way that the monsters went to work and used the doors of children to enter their realm and scare them was a brilliant idea. This concept really tied the whole movie together. It was a critical part of the film for this is where Sully and Mike met Boo. The way that they competed on who can gather the most screams from children affected the movie in a positive way for it added more comedic parts in it.If you are looking for an animated yet memorable movie to watch that contains drama and comedy, Monster's Inc. is the film to choose."
"This is a resubmitted comment, the original was removed by a complaint from some anonymous aggrieved party. Let's hope the edits are sufficient this time.You already know that this is the usual Pixar fare, which is to say that it is excellent, better than any non-Pixar animated film. Sure, you also know that and you probably know the usual reason given: that Pixar spends more time on basic storytelling values than anyone else.Here are two elements of this that may deepen your appreciation. The first is that Pixar recognized early that 3D animation software allowed two types of advance in the third dimension. The first is obvious, that everything has depth and reflection and shadow more or less like reality.The second is that once these objects and scenes are defined in the computer, it is no extra work to move the camera anywhere. it can loop and swoop in ways that we never could have before. Pixar decided to exploit this in their storytelling here and later in ""Nemo.""Nemo was set in an environment where there was no horizon so the camera could flow and the watery feel of the place could make the unfamiliar fluidity of the camera seem more natural. Here, is where they tested some of those perspectives in the three dimensional door warehouse and the extra dimensions of going in and out. Those scenes make this for me.The second interesting thing is some competitive background. In those days, there was a shooting war between Bill Gates, financier of Dreamworks Animation (and leader of Microsoft) and Steve Jobs of Pixar (and leader of Apple). This was in the heyday of Gates' dirty tricks and he was intent on burying Jobs forever. Pixar depended on the success of ""A Bug's Life"" their followon to ""Toy Story,"" so Dreamworks rushed ""Antz"" -- a cheapy -- to open a week or so before to steal the market.""Bugs"" prevailed, sufficiently at least, and Pixar ramped up for their usual three year development of ""Monsters."" Dreamworks, getting wind of this, went all out with ""Shrek,"" their ""monster"" movie that could be released six months earlier. It only took a year because the animation is less perfect. But they were overt in their attack this time: ""Shrek"" made literal fun of Disney, the Pixar partner. The head guy at Disney was the model for the blowhard King who reigned over a fairytale kingdom populated with -- can you guess? -- all the old Disney characters.Pixar/Jobs would never do something so spiteful. But perhaps they did subtly appreciate the use of windows and gates to the future that always seemed to go wrong. And now you can too.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"Pixar. With only seven movies you've built yourself a reputation as the greatest current animation studio of them all. Dreamworks has made some good ones and 20th Century Fox's movies have made me chuckle a bit, and Disney has gone downhill in recent years. But you can consistently produce quality work with almost no stain on your track record (except A Bug's Life, the one Pixar movie I did not enjoy). But I've lost track of my thoughts.I'm here to talk about Monster's Inc., my personal favorite Pixar movie.I'm a doodler myself, and wan't to be an animator someday. And I love drawing monsters. Weird looking, many armed, strange-eyed creatures. That may have been the 1st reason Monster's Inc. appealed to me. So many of these creatures looked like something I would draw, and I spent much of my movie time looking at the creatures in the background.I also was captivated by the world that was created in Inc. A big problem for me in Pixar's newest movie Cars was lack of real explanation for their universe, like how they built their buildings. In Monster's Inc. the monster world is explained so much more in depth, and we really believe this world could exist. There's a beauty in watching the thousands of closet doors zoom around and I always get goosebumps from watching the ""scare montage"", because I now know the mechanics of the world these creatures live in. The characters in the world are also incredibly well realized. Mike and Sully both are easily relatable to, and even small characters have feelings and motivations we can understand. ""Boo"" actually behaves like a young child would, and that helped me believe she had real emotions. But the creature Randall is what stole the show for me. With his many arms, chameleon-like ability and sheer voice presence, it was hard for me to keep my eyes off of him. But what really made me love this movie so was the characters. When it comes time for the ""sad part"" of this movie, I was sad. I was actually seeing an animated cartoon that managed to make me feel for these animated creatures without being emotionally manipulative. And I'm not afraid to admit that I cry 4 out of 5 times at the ending.So, in the end, I can't recommend this film enough. I think this stands above all other Pixar productions and is definitely one of the best animated films I've had the pleasure of seeing."
"''Monsters, Inc.'' is great! Before I have watched movies from Pixar like '' The Incredibles'',''Shrek'' or even ''Finding Nemo'', ''Monsters Inc.'' was one of the first movies made by Pixar that I watched and enjoyed a lot! The monsters like Mike and Sulley are charismatic and funny,and the story is very pleasant as well: In the monster's land, the monsters generate their city's power by scaring human children.One of the biggest companies of energy is the famous 'Monsters, Inc', where Mike and James Sullivan work. James is very famous in his work, since he is one of the 'scariest'and the one who produces the bigger amount of energy to the company. One night, however, Sully uncovers a devious plot to rid Monster city of it's power problems but accidentally lets a human little girl to enter the monster world. The funny thing is that the monsters really believes that children can contaminate them, so, everybody is afraid of children, specially the little girl who entered the monster's world. Mike and James call the little girl 'Boo'and after seeing she looks harmless, they try to send her back to her world. But many things, Randall included, are trying to not let their plan come true..."
"Set in a world of Monsters, where the most scary thing is a human child, there is a shortage of Power at the the Scream factory, a place where Monsters enter our world through the closets of young children to collect their Screams.Sully (John Goodman) the Top Scarer, stumbles upon a child who has somehow entered our world, with his buddy Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) Sully finds out that Human Children are not as dangerous as they are made out to be. And there is more to the Scream Factory than meets the eye.Brilliantly animated, with some hilarious characters, Monsters inc is another Pixar Delight for the whole family8/10"
"Monsters Mike Wazowski and Sulley are the best scare team in Monsters Inc. The company catches the screams of children to power the city of Monstropolis.  However Sulley's main rival, Randall Boggs is up to no good and is working the rooms after the factory is shut.  Sulley stays late one night to find a door has been left open and that a highly dangerous little girl gets trapped on the wrong side of the door.  With the contamination unit closing in on them, Mike and Sulley must get the girl back into her room and uncover Randall's plot.From the Toy Story producing Pixar comes yet another child/adult cartoon. The story here will satisfy adults and children but it feels like an excuse for things to happen rather than a story in itself.  Where Toy Story had layers of story this is quite straightforward.  That's not to say it's not good, but it is more aimed towards the children than the adults.Similarly the majority of the comedy is aimed at children.  The only consistent laughs for adults come from the original `one-eyed monster' (where was that joke!?) Mike - he delivers plenty of funny lines and his musical over the outtakes is the funniest thing in the whole film.  The problem is that it doesn't have Toy Story's spread of backup characters to deliver one-liners, here we have the three main characters and a couple of baddies, other than that there are no really good support roles - even Celia is wasted as Mike's love interest.There are still more laughs than many real comedies!  But it's unfortunate that it's only left to Mike to carry the adult humour.  The animation here has really advanced from Toy Story - just check out Sulley's hairy coat to see the detail.  At times you forget it's a cartoon - the characters and backgrounds just look so very real.  The final chase through the many doors of the factory is really exciting visually and is pleasing to all.A great voice cast includes Crystal, Goodman, Coburn, Buscemi, and Tilly all do well, but Crystal is the only one that has much to do and he comes away with all the praise.Overall it is aimed more at kids than adults and it's not near the heights of Toy Story.  However there is still lots to enjoy for all ages."
"Monsters generate their city's power by scaring children, but they are terribly afraid themselves of being contaminated by children, so when one enters Monstropolis, top scarer Sulley finds his world disrupted.Monster's Inc explores childhood fear, the fear of looking under your bed or looking at your open closet thinking a monster would pop out. Pixar of course wouldn't make it fearful, but brought lightheartedness to it and made a highly imaginative tale of a fictional world where monsters scare children to power their city. This film is illustrated with creative monsters and styled with classy/jazzy music. The feeling while watching this is amazing and the emotions you feel for the monsters is just magical. Pixar has once again OUTDONE their-selves with every project they have thought of. Monster's Inc is definitely one of the top Pixar movies and also one of the most creative. If you can outlook the childish themes and look deeper into the movie's heart and soul, you will definitely be immersed in Pixar's movie-making magic. Most people would complain about the animation because animated movies have this thing when where one sees one, it's automatically horrible and childish. If one is made by Pixar, I highly recommend you sit down and see what they can do to animations; you will be amazed. 10/10."
"I only watched it on DVD, but I wish I was at the theater, when Monsters, Inc. was released. Anyway, I was blown away. Sometimes I was rolling on the ground while laughing, sometimes I couldn't hold back my tears. Simply amazing, marvellous filmmaking.The animation is picture-perfect, the dialogue is brilliant, the story is truly original. Pixar's finest, I think, it's way better than Finding Nemo. A cinematic masterpiece, which is full of emotions and laughter. If you haven't seen it yet, then GO, RENT IT! You won't be disappointed, I guarantee it.Boo is the cutest animation movie character EVER.An obvious 10/10"
"This movie is one of the most brilliant, creative and intelligent animated movies of all time, along with all the other Pixar Animation Studios' Movies. The characters are hilarious (Billy Crystal as Mike Wazowski and John Goodman as Sulley was brilliant) and heartfelt, and the movie exposes raw sensitivity with the separation of Sulley and Boo. The animation is incredible, the humor is witty and the storyline is flawless. This movie should be seen by any Pixar fan, Billy Crystal or Goodman fan, or anyone who just plain likes funny movies, lighthearted ones. Pixar, you've done it again, made a brilliant epic masterpiece! Congrats! Watch out for another appearance by John Ratzenberger (Hamm, P.T.Flea etc.). Hint: Himalayas! Overall, loved it! And I can't see why anyone else wouldn't either. Something for everyone!"
"This film is great. It made me laugh out loud and made me feel sad when I was supposed to too. The monsters all live in a city called Monstropolis and they need the screams of children to power everything. Sully (the big blue furry monster) is the top scarer and he and his one-eyed green friend Mike work together at ""Monsters, Incorporated"" gathering screams. The monsters are terrified of the children however, thinking that if they get touched by a child they will die. One of the children (she ends up being known as Boo) gets into the monster world and everyone goes into a panic. Sully and Mike must return her to her home before she gets caught. Boo is a cute little character and that's a lot coming from me (I am not a huge fan of small children - it may be because she isn't real). There is also an evil creepy monster called Randal who is planning on kidnapping children to harvest as much scream as possible. The animation was great, I am always amazed at the patience that must go into animating hair, Sully is very hairy. As with all Pixar films there are ""bloopers"" during the credits which were really funny. With some of the rubbish that Disney seems to be coming out with (Little Mermaid 2, Jungle Book 2 anyone?), Disney/Pixar has to be the wave of the future."
"Great family film. One of the most underrated movies of the year. I took my 2 year old to see it. He loved it! He now has books and toys of Mike and Sully! This movie will be going into our library. We can't wait for the DVD release in September 2002!Just think they did not need a campaign of trailers, food chain promotions and commercials. If you have a solid story line and a genuine scriptpeople will come to see it!"
"As I'm 20 years old I wasn't very enthusiastic when one of my friend's brought Monsters Inc over to watch one night. I've never been into what I once thought were kids movies. I couldn't get into A Bug's Life or the Toy Story movies (though they were just as well-made) but when I saw Monsters Inc I was amazed. The colours are beautiful and the monsters actually have individual personalities that you can form an opinion about. My personal favourite is Sully - the way the bond grows between him and Boo is wonderful to watch, and he's such a tender, caring character. It's the only animated movie that has ever truly moved me - the ending brought a tear to my eye. I cannot find any fault with this movie and I fell in love with it the first time I saw it. I'm now the proud owner of the DVD and it's definitely one of my favourite movies ever. Anyone who hasn't seen it should - it's brilliant."
"This was a wonderful movie, with colourful characters, a fun storyline, and a funny and sometimes touching script.(I liked Shrek as well, but I slightly preferred this) I don't think it is quite as good as Toy Story, but I found it an enormously entertaining film, it was much better than I expected. The animation was truly excellent, with colourful and engaging backgrounds, and no stiff movements as far as I could see. I wasn't hugely keen on the song playing over the end credits, but compared to the overall goodness of the film, that is such a minor criticism, and it is fair to say that people have different tastes in music. The script was very, very funny, particularly with the character Roz. The voice talents were fantastic, John Goodman and Billy Crystal were brilliant as Sulley and Mike, Steve Buschemi clearly has a lot of seedy fun as Randall, Jennifer Tilly is wonderfully innocent as Mike's girlfriend, and the late James Coburn is wholly convincing as Waternoose. And I loved the character of Boo, she was so cute, and I loved the ending, people complained it was overly-sentimental but I thought it was so sweet. The story, as is always the case with Pixar films is highly original and charming, and doesn't drag at all. Overall, a wonderful film, truly entertaining and a must-see, and if you are starting to lose faith in Disney and their countless sequels, this is perfect for you. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox."
"MONSTERS, INC. / (2001) *** (out of four)By Blake French:When I was a kid, I imagined a world of monsters just like the one in ""Monsters, Inc."" I dreamed of a magical kingdom full of strange, menacing creatures. Creatures that waited anxiously for bedrooms to darken at night so they could jump out of closets and scare unsuspecting children. Alone in my darkened bedroom, surrounded by complete and utter silence, I heard lots of strange noises. When I noticed something unusual, like a sudden squeak or a shadow on the wall, it wasn't uncommon for me to pull the covers over my head. Heck, don't tell anybody, but I still do that today.  
Children will remember the characters of this film long after they see it. Expect to hear comments about monsters in the closet weeks after they see it. But their remarks will not come out of terror, but out of pure joy. The Academy Award-winning creators of ""Toy Story"" give us a new, pleasing insight on monsters. It turns what was once a motif for terror into an imaginative realm of entertaining delight.This computer animated production represents the most advanced technology of Disney and Pixar, the highly acclaimed team behind such family gems as ""A Bug's Life,"" and ""Toy Story 2."" From its convincing depiction of monster fur, to the realistic shadowing, lighting, and movement, the filmmakers pay close attention to the even the slightest details. The story revolves around a massive corporation where all kinds of monsters reside. It's called Monsters, Inc., the biggest scream processing factory in the monster world. Set in Monstropolis, the main power source of the city is the collected screams of human children. We meet a hairy blue creature named Sully (voiced by John Goodman), and his friend, roommate, and assistant, Mike (voiced by Billy Crystal). These guys are the best scream producers ever, much to the dismay of Randall Boggs (voiced by Steve Buscemi), a creepy, lizard monster who will stop at nothing to claim their coveted standing. One day, Sully accidentally allows a human child to enter the monster world. To complicate matters, human children are said to be highly toxic to monsters and should be avoided at all costs. Sully quickly finds his career in jeopardy and his life in total chaos. When Mike enters the situation, the two uncover a scandal at Monsters, Inc. that will place their very lives in jeopardy. ""Monsters, Inc."" works rather well until it introduces this annoying little girl as a plot device. I know I am being excessively critical here, and I know that my personal hatred for whiny, giggly, squirmy infants seized me over. Some audiences will find this character absolutely adorable, maybe even as the film's most distinguished. Though for me, this character almost destroyed the entire movie.  I understand the need for a child to enter Monstropolis, but why couldn't the film have had fun with the idea. Perhaps it could have used a child old enough to understand his circumstances, but young enough to delight in the wonder of his newly discovered world. Instead, the movie gives us a nonsensical plot in which the infant gets herself into one problematic situation after another. This has worked before. In ""Baby's Day Out"" we laughed at the accidental irony of the situations. Here, the character gets herself into these situations. She becomes a nuisance even as she initially appears on screen. There is nothing innovative or creative with a young girl running in and out of rooms, yet ""Monsters, Inc."" insists it's funny. The film becomes a one-joke comedy. If you're old enough to cross the street by yourself, you're probably too sophisticated for this humor. Despite this parasite of a character, ""Monsters, Inc."" still manages to come out of the one-joke routine and display a third act of climbing excitement, surprising twists, and entertaining action that will amuse children of all ages. If not for the pesky little girl, this movie might have been one of the most colorfully creative films of the year. All though it is not, ""Monsters, Inc."" does contain enough imagination and colorful images to warrant a trip to the multiplex. But don't say I didn't warn you about the kids. During the screening I attended, jam-packed with children running all around and making noise, I had a little boy sitting behind me that kept kicking my seat. Now that's something I never want to see coming out of my closet."
"First came Toy Story. It was cute, but lacked bite. The technology was new, and Pixar was still experimenting. Next came A Bug's Life. It was remarkable. Then came Toy Story 2. Even better! Now here is their fourth feature: Monsters Inc. I'm not sure that it's better than Toy Story 2, but at the very least it's equal. It doesn't compare with that film in terms of hilarity. Toy Story 2, in my opinion, is one of the funniest films of the past several years, if not the funniest. However, Monters Inc. has a couple of advantages over TS2 (and, I promise you, it is at least as funny as any other film from 2001). First, the animation is even better than TS2. What? What did you say? Shrek? Ugh, don't even mention that waste of hard-drive space. Monsters Inc. is simply gorgeous in its color schemes. And the movement of the characters is so smooth it looks almost as if it were just the best stop-motion animation ever created. In the film, there is a Japanese restaurant that the monsters go to that's named after the great stop-motion master Roy Harryhausen. I'm sure he'd be stunned at the accomplishment. Second, it has a couple of the most exciting sequences in animation history, especially the climactic sequence in the door room. That's a scene that'll go down in the books. And, third, it's perhaps the first Disney film since Dumbo to be touching, but not cloying. Although some people have told me that the one song in TS2 made them cry, I personally was cringing through that number. There's a scene in Monsters Inc. that honestly made me cry. Generally, that's not much. I'm easily moved. However, I don't fail to notice if a film is emotionally manipulative. That's not the case here. The only other Disney moment that really touched me that deeply is the ""Baby Mine"" song from Dumbo. I think that the only people who don't cry during that song are convicts on death row. I really loved the characters in Monsters Inc. The relationship that develops between Sully and Boo is truly touching. It's developed in a very natural way. And it certainly helps that Boo is easily the cutest kid in the universe, even if she's not real. There were a lot of ""aww""s in the theater, but they were coming from college students, not maddening parents trying to get their kids to pay attention. Oh! And did I mention that the film's villain is one of Disney's best? He's a chameleon-like monster named Raymond, voiced by Steve Buscemi. Sure, his motives aren't all that interesting, but I love the way he moves. It's amazing. And his face is so expressive, but not too expressive like the characters in, say, ahem, Shrek.As much as I would love to, I can't say that Monsters Inc. is a perfect film. There are a couple of flaws. The first fifteen minutes or so, basically until Boo wanders out into the monsters' world, are pretty boring. By this point, though, I was so amazed at the beauty of the artwork that I hardly cared. Also, most of the monsters aren't very interesting looking, that is, besides the colors. Raymond and the big boss of Monsters Inc., who is a spider-like creature, are the most interesting. Also, Billy Crystal's girlfriend in the film, a Medusa-like creature, with snakes for hair that copy her emotions, is very cool. Most of the other monsters are so cute that it's a wonder that they can scare children at all! (That's how they get fuel, by the way; children's screams power the monsters' world). Sully, for instance, who is the main character, more or less (the commercials concentrate on Billy Crystal's character more, for some reason; the logic must be that Billy Crystal is a bigger box office draw than big, fat John Goodman, a pretty insulting thought). Anyhow, Boo comes into the monsters' world because she thinks he is a giant kitty! We can't blame them too much for this, though. You know Disney would never produce a film that didn't have an ability to push their line of plush toys. Some of the monsters, though, are kind of boring. This is especially true with Mike, the little green cyclops ball played by Crystal. Sully could become a classic hero, and Raymond a classic villain, but it's doubtful Mike will stick in your head for as long. Crystal is, however, very funny in the film (and that might be the only time I'll ever say that!). He'll never be as boring as Shrek, nor as painful to listen to as Eddie Murphy as the donkey in Shrek. The story of Monsters Inc. is full of cliches, which is unfortunate. As I've been trying to point out, most everything else about the film is so inventive that it's not too noticeable, but it will never be unnoticeable. You'll see the revelation that the monsters have at the end two hours before the movie starts. Your youngest child might not figure it out, but anyone over eight will know as soon as it's humanly possible. There's also the kind of betrayal that's popping up so often now in animation, well, in all movies, really, that you can almost take it for granted anymore. And, heck, I would've predicted it myself if I weren't being so enormously entertained! If it weren't for these cliches, Monsters Inc. might have ended up earning the title as one of the best movies I had ever seen. Still, I'll never forget it! Now, what can Pixar possibly do to surpass this? 9/10."
"I know. That's a pretty bold statement. Don't get me wrong, ""The Incredibles"" is certainly worthy of mentioning in this post as is ""Toy Story"" & ""Finding Nemo"". Hell, there hasn't been a weak Pixar film yet. ""Cars"" is definitely my least favorite, but was still miles ahead of anything Dreamworks has done.But for me ""Monsters Inc."" is just the complete package. Obviously the animation is stellar. That pretty much goes without saying for this company. But the animation isn't even the greatest strength of this film. Like ""Toy Story"" before it, the characters in this movie possessed depth and personality, as much as any live action film. Whoever didn't fall in love with Boo upon first introduction, is either heartless or a robot. And furthermore the relationship that develops between Sully and Boo is absolutely touching, while the dynamic of Mike and Sully's relationship is complex and anything but uninteresting.And then there's the real accomplishment of ""Monsters Inc."" which is the originality and creativity inherent in every aspect. This film has such a rich imagination that can be found in everything from the Characters to the films sense of humor. And the plot is one of the most original pieces of screen writing I've ever seen. The first thing I thought after seeing this movie for the first time (And I went to catch the Star Wars: Episode II trailer, not expecting too much from the actual movie!) was ""How in the hell did they dream that up?!?"" I always admire when a movie provides a story that you know was given the utmost thought and attention, and this is no exception.Upon further viewings I began seeing it as timeless fairy tale. Like a household bedtime story that's been around for centuries. I was certain it would have at least an 8.0 rating on this site and was a little confused to see otherwise, especially with other Pixar works in the top 250. But alas I know that this is all just my own opinion and not everyone agrees. Is there anyone else that feels so strongly about this movie? Am I crazy? Dellusional? Maybe all of the above.But at the end of the day this truly is a great piece of film. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and walk, no run... you know what take your time, but get somewhere that has this movie and watch it. Alright, you know what? Forget about the whole ""take your time"" thing. Go now!"
"Monsters Inc. is just what I expected, Amazing. Every time I see a Pixar movie, from the spectacular Finding Nemo, or the hilarious Toy Story, I know I will be enjoyed. Pixar has such a way with making movies interesting to all ages. Because everyone of all ages, can relate to these characters, or the plot. From all the special features and commentaries I watch on these movies, the directors and writers really do spend so much time in making sure all audiences can watch their movies.Now that I have talked about Pixar, I will talk about Monsters Inc. The movie is just wonderful. From the first scene, where the monster is just totally destroying this kid's room, to the last scene, where Sulley finally sees Boo again, I laugh, I worry, I feel. If anyone says there is nothing funny in this movie, they must either have no sense of humor, or a really bad sense of humor, or just want to be cynical. The movie is HILARIOUS, with lines such as ""did you loose weight, or a limb"" The voices are wonderful, John Goodman just has this wonderful voice for animated films, it is so deep and hard, but tender and soft. Billy Crystal is just wonderfully funny. Even all the little characters, like the abominable snow man, are just hilarious. And the story is also touching, you really feel for Boo, and her relationship with Sulley, and even with Mike.I think the thing that makes Pixar so different from all other animation companies such as Dreamworks, Pixar doesn't very many vocal songs. They have an orchestra do most of their music. It gives the movies much more of a genuine tone. Even though i love the sound track to Shrek and Shrek 2, I feel i watch the movie for the music, not the plot. Pixar has such amazing music, you don't realize that it almost another character to the films.Overall, Monsters Inc. is a wonderfully entertaining film and should be watched by any age group."
"This movie is great!  Technically its amazing but the attention to realistic detail makes the movie.  It is obvious that one of the animators has a small child running around the house. Boo's mannerisms are dead-on.  The story itself is well told, too.I am not really a big fan of animated movies, but this one is definitely one that I will see several times in the theatre and own when it comes out on video.  Its not just a children's movie!  >)"
"I don't know how many times I have watched this movie, but it always makes me laugh like it's the first time I see it. Overall I think it's one of the most original and entertaining movies Disney has ever produced."
"I am always happy too see a Pixar movie. They have not yet disappointed and there films are always perfect. They missed a few things in Cars. But smashed away by worries away with Ratatouille. They haven't made one bad film. Just by the knowledge of Monsters Inc being made by Pixar should be enough for anyone to see this. Again another superb animated movie.The animation was great. Wonderful color and details. After a little while the characters stop being 3D images and start being lovable and actually have the ability to move you to tears.Even though there are monsters in this it is still suitable for kids. There are some scenes that could scare young kids. But they shouldn't scare kids too much.The story was great. It was very creative. Monsters Inc is the kids scream power plant in the monster world. In the monster world human children are toxic. When the plants top scaring team Sully and Mike accidentally let one kid called Boo into their world. All hell breaks loose. Returning the kid to her bedroom is not as easy as it sounds.I couldn't have asked for a better ending. There's action,laughter and tears.This movie just keeps getting better and better. From a colorful and creative opening to a funny end credits scene, Monsters Inc is one to put on your must watch list. I recommend it.10/10"
"When I first heard about this film somewhere in 2001, I thought that, after the failure from Toy Story 2, Pixar wouldn't redeem themselves. But in early 2002, when I saw this in theaters, I was shocked! The movie was fantastic! I laughed at everything to be laughed at, and the beautiful animation and wonderful voice cast just made it better.The Plot: (may contain spoilers) The movie starts out with an introductory to all the main characters and scenes. Mike Wasoski(Billy Crystal) and James P. Sullivan(John Goodman) are getting the day started when the new TV commercial for Monsters Inc. premiers. Mike is so anxious to see himself on TV, but when he's on the screen, the Monster's Inc. logo covers most of his body. Mike doesn't realize this however and starts shouting with joy.After the morning is started, Mike and Sully head off to work. Mike wants to drive his new car, but Sully says that there's a scream shortage(screams are used to power the city) and that they must walk. Along the way, they encounter some friends and neighbors.When they arrive, Mike walks up to the counter to see Celia(Jennifer Tilly), who he refers to as ""Googly Bear"". It's her birthday and Mike has reservations from a restaurant known for its almost impossibility to get a reservation. After that, he and Sully walk to the locker room to get ready.Mike leaves the locker room early to get his flies from Roz, the secretary who wants it her way and her way only. Mike tries to make it romantic, but fails to put her in a good mood. He still pretends to like her as he walks away, but then snaps out of it soon.Mike and the other scare assistants get the work station ready. They take they're scare card out and slide it in. A door comes by and locks into the station. The door leads to a child's room. It is the scarer's duty to scare the child to produce screams.After setup, the scarers come out. The attendant prepares the monitor and scare records. The assistants prepare the scarer while the attendant prepares the countdown. Then the monsters run into the room and scare the child. Some aren't so lucky, but it turns out to be a good day.But then a scarer, George Sanderson, comes out with a sock on his back. This is considered toxic(the code is 23-19) and the CDA(Child Detection Agency) charges in. A child or anything owned or touched by the child is considered dangerous to monsters. George is decontaminated and has all his fur shaved off.The scare floor is shut down for 30 minutes. The day then goes on as usual. Henry J. Waternoose(James Coburn) asks Sully to come by and give some trainee scares a demonstration. Sully agrees, and eventually the quitting bell rings.Mike and Sully walk into Roz again. Mike says he has a fun-filled evening planned, but after Roz reminds him about paperwork e was supposed to file, he immediately panics. Sully says he'll get the paperwork just as Celia arrives to get Mike. Mike tells Sully what to do and leaves with his date.Sully goes back to the scare floor to get the report. he notices a door was left behind, which is considered carelessness, because all doors must be return by the end of the day. Sully explores the door to see if anyone is left behind. Then he notices a child is play with his tail. He screams in terror and runs off.I'd like to say more, but because of the character limit, I should leave it to you to find out what happens next.The Voices: This movies features a variety of great voice talent. It stars talent like John Goodman(TV's Rosanne), Billy Crystal(Deconstructing Harry), Steve Buscemi(King Of New York), and even a cameo by Frank Oz(Star Wars). All of them worked hard and it paid off.The Verdict: This is a wonderful movie and it's a great way to help younger kids understand that monsters aren't always scary. Plus the great humor, brilliant animation, and wonderful voice cast don't even begin to say how great this movie is.10/10"
"I purchased this movie over online as a DVD pair, the only movie I have ever done this with. I liked Randall Boggs best and found myself sympathizing with him more than I ever have a villain before. The plot twist may have been foreseeable to some reviewers, but I was taken completely by surprise when I first saw it, and even seeing it again do not have any inkling about what it will be until it is revealed. The relationship between Sully and Mike is right on target, and the storyline is excellent. I did not see this for the humor, but for the plot and setting, and at these the movie is superlative. The only problem is that we do not have a PG-6 rating level, since it really doesn't deserve a PG-13 yet might be too scary for very small children."
"Though I slept on the couch throughout my life, I never really experienced sleeping in my own bed until I got older; and yet, I never figured out if monsters ever lived in my closet or better yet, wondered why there would be a monster in my closet? Monsters, Inc. is about a company in Monstorpolis City (hence the title) that has monsters to scare kids as a way of their energy of keeping the city alive. It's very amusing that they show the monsters in a room where they would have different doors leading to a room in different parts of the human world. The world's top scarer is James P. Sullivan (voiced by John Goodman) who is known to friends, family and fans as Sulley. His assistant is the little one-eyed green ball Mike Wasizoki (Billy Crystal) in which they are partners no matter what (like Shrek and Donkey). Sulley's competitor is Randall Wallace (no relation to the director and is voiced by Steve Buscemi) who will do anything to win and be number one.The rule that Monsters, Inc. has is not to get into contact or let a child touch them. In one scene during the big scream fest, a big blue monster screams out of a closet crying saying that the child wasn't scared and that it touched him. The other monster replies, ""She was only six!"" When Randall tries to cheat in the competition while every monster is away, Sulley sees a door with flowers on it and opens the door. He hears someone messing with his tail and sees a little girl playing with it. Sully does not scare her, but he's reaction lead into a chase where this time it's the other way around; the little girl is chasing the monster. The city finds out that there's a little girl on the run and afraid that they'll get a disease from the child. Though the film is a buddy picture, the main characters are the little girl (Boo) and Sulley as he watches over her making sure that she doesn't get hurt. Most people would consider ""Shrek"" a better cartoon because of its cruelness and ethnicity, but I also like ""Monsters, Inc."" because it's cute in a way of curiosity and realizing that monsters have lives too."
"This film had really cool, imaginative animation.  Plus the plot was entertaining.  I liked the idea of children's screams powering Monstropolis, cute and funny.  The little girl, Boo, had such a funny, little laugh.  I liked how all the monster characters had their own personalities.  From the striking colors to the way the hair moved on Sully to the snow blizzard, the CGI was great.   I also liked the expected chase scene because it was  a little different in this movie. Here, Sully, Mike, and Boo travel through doors and come out in different places and out of different doors as they are being chased by the evil Randall as they search for Boo's door.  I just really liked the uniqueness of these scenes.  Also, the final scene was touching, and we get to see how Sully's character transform from a scarer to someone who just wants to make kids laugh. 
FINAL VERDICT:  I highly recommend this for kids as well as adults. It is entertaining, cute, and funny."
"If you liked ""Toy Story"", you gotta see this latest one from the same studio, PIXAR. The monsters in this town work at a factory that can put them in any child's closet world wide. Screams power the city and are collected via these portals. But strangely enough, any contact with a child also scares the monsters, let alone the thought that one should come back thru the door into their city. The pressure is on Sulley and his one-eyed partner, Mike, to keep their number one ranking at work. Randall will to anything to get that number one spot, even... Although this movie is not meant for real young children, all will enjoy the story. The animation is top rate, so well done you can see his the texture of his fur and the scales on his skin. I can only hope PIXAR will top this with their next animated feature..."
I always enjoy watching monsters inc this movie never gets old
"Even if you're not a child, it is OK to watch a great kids film, especially when life gets you down. This is one of those perfect animated films which kids and adults can both love, yet view on a different level. Top notch animation, too, unlike the other film starring these lovable characters."
One of my favourite movie of all time. I love the friendship between Mike and sully.
"Ah, good old child nostalgia; it attaches to your memories. Any child deserves to see this. JOYFUL!"
Such originality from Pixar again. Creating an entire world to get lost in. The characters are lovable and the storyline to fit. A brilliant film
"Sully and Mike (voiced by John Goodman and Billy Crystal) are employees at Monsters Inc., a scream-fueled plant that provides power to Monsteropolis. Screams are generated by 'scarers' (and Sully is the best), who enter children's bedrooms via the closet and are harvested by their partners (in Sully's case, his best friend Mike). Extreme care must be taken, as children are highly toxic to monsters, so when one is accidently transported to the factory, pandemonium ensues. The film is the fourth of Pixar's full length animated features and like most of the studio's work, is excellent. The story is fun with a clever 'twist' to the ending, the animators manage to inject a tremendous amount of character and personality into the CGI characters, and the choice of voice talent is perfect (I especially liked Steve Buscemi as the chameleonic villain Randall). CGI technology has advanced considerably since the film was released but the imagery still holds up and the vast 'closet door' storage facility is great. Typical of the studio, there are a lot of amusing details in the background that are worth watching for. Good, timeless fun for all ages."
"This is a hilarious, fast paced fun movie about a little girl who gets into the monster world with Mike and Sully. Sully's bond with Boo (the girl) is probably the best thing about the movie. I also loved the character of Randall and the scene where they're flying around hanging onto doors is very entertaining."
Look I've seened many Disney movies we all have at least most of us but this was a major success for its writing animation and heart warming pilot and dialogue this was a major in the early 2000's and will also be when you look at a Disney movies enough times you realize that it will never get old and you will still remember it probably.
"Ok I understand it's 2018 and this movie released in November of 2002, but I feel like I should still give my own personal review! Monsters Inc is Just one of many of Pixar's Library And just happens to be a big hit!! My own score of this masterpiece is 10/10, mainly for the Heartwarming relationship of Sully and Boo, the friendship of Mike and Sully, Humor, Visuals are insane for 2002, and the Soundtrack Is Really quite Good! In total conclusion Monsters Inc Will definitely be a film to remember for a long time to come!!"
This movie was the only thing I would fall asleep to every night and I have watched it more times than I could possibly count. To this day when I watch it it still makes me cry. It's beautifully done and has a great plot. In my opinion. It's the best movie ever to come out of Disney Pixar.
"MONSTERS INC - 2001Directed by ​Pete Docter, Lee Unkrich & David SilvermanStarring Billy Crystal, John Goodman and Steve BuscemiPlot Overview: ​Monsters Incorporated is the largest scare factory in the monster world, and James P. Sullivan (John Goodman) is one of its top scarers. Sullivan is a huge, intimidating monster with blue fur, large purple spots and horns. His scare assistant, best friend and roommate is Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal), a green, opinionated, feisty little one-eyed monster. Visiting from the human world is Boo (Mary Gibbs), a tiny girl who goes where no human has ever gone before.This movie is a definitive representation of Pixar Standard, back in their golden age. I am confident it will become an animated classic, and rightfully so. It is rare for a movie to come out that is so original, creative and imaginative. The voice acting is amazing, especially from Crystal and Goodman. The animation is great. My main flaw with the movie is how awful the plot is.It's a paper thin plot that features way too many 'twists and turns' to make it interesting. I don't know a SINGLE person who says they were interested by the plot of this movie. I don't. My adoration for this film stems from the colourful characters, not an overly complicated plot about power shortages. Two things that are kinda plot related that I do like, however, are are the climax and the final scene of the movie. The climax for this movie is an insanely fun ride and it is just so creative in how it is handled. Then the final scene of this movie. I mean damn it is a punch to the stomach. I'm not spoiling anything but I mean, damn Pixar. Why. Don't do this to me.As far as performances go, this movie is very strong. Billy Crystal gives one of my favourite Pixar performances as Mike Wazowski and is the standout of this film. He is consistently funny and Crystal showed some impressive range in emotion delivered. John Goodman is also excellent as Sully and provided as strong, authoritative presence to the role. Steve Buscemi is great as Randall and makes him one of my favourite Pixar villains, easily. James Coburn was alright as Waterloose but I really did not find his character interesting in the slightest. The design on him was amazing though. Boo is a cute character and serves her purpose so I can't really praise nor fault her. For the time of this film's release, the animation is exceptional. Seriously, it looks fantastic for the time. I absolutely love the character design for all the characters. Each and everyone is unique and hints at the characters personality without requiring them to speak much at all. One minor flaw with the animation is that Boo looks like a plastic doll. She doesn't look human at all. I understand there were limitations at the time but it is sill a flaw. It is a well shot and edited movie. Comedy wise, this is probably one of Pixar's funniest. The humour is genuinely good and that primarily comes down to Crystal's impressive performance and vocal talent. As far as emotional payoff goes, this movie also succeeds. The last scene is all I need to refer to because that scene is Pixar punching me in the stomach continuously. It is very well done.This movie is a prime example of what Pixar is capable of. It is funny with good emotional payoff, it has great animation, great vocal performances and a fantastic premise. It truly is an exceptional movie. I'll rate Monsters Inc 9 Googlybears out of 10!"
"Monsters Inc. does for monsters what Toy Story did for toys. Yet another Disney top animation that my kids and I can see over and over again, and a classic that should be in everyone's DVD collection. I feel Disney has mastered pairing up the voice actors with their animated characters, and in this case, an excellent choice casting Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Mary Gibbs and Steve Buscemi. Loved this animation and it's a perfect 10/10 from me!"
"I can honestly say that I haven't seen a film this bad since I sat through Planet Of the Apes(Tim Burtons). I laughed at most twice and they were strained. There were some children around me who seemed to like it, but it seemed to me like one big game of Hide and Seek. Gave it a 3 simply because kids will like it. I thought Toy Story was good(not great, not as good as Shrek for instance), but this terrible....."
"I was truly disappointed.  I expected to find the humor that was in Shrek. I found myself looking at my watch.  My older daughter fell asleep.  The animation was great but I found the story and humor lacking. This is not one that I will purchase for video.  When I walked out of Shrek, I couldn't wait for it to come out on video."
"""James, this company has been in my family for three generations. I would do anything to keep it from going under!"" - Henry J. Waternoose (""Monster's Inc"")One of Pixar's best films, ""Monster's Inc"" plays like a buddy comedy in which a hairy blue monster (John Goodman) and a one eyed testicle (Billy Crystal) struggle to protect a human child from corporate bad guys.The film is super cute and supremely precious, but never dips into the kind of annoying mawkishness that plagues Pixar's later films (""Up"" and ""Wall-E""). This is primarily thanks to the vocal talents of John Goodman and Billy Crystal, two seasoned comedians who not only lend the film real warmth, but are able to capture the kind of edgy, rapid-fire banter that Hawks and Wilder were known for. Unique in the Pixar canon, this is thus a dialogue driven film, relying on sharp exchanges, a screwball plot and lots of buddy interactions.Like most Pixar films, this is also a hypocritical message movie. Here we have a ""big corporation"" (Monsters Inc - they're literally comprised of ""corporate monsters"") who not only specialise in ""exploiting"" humans, but refuse to adopt better, more efficient and ""environmentally friendly"" practises. Thankfully such preaching is handled with subtlety (unlike ""Wall-E""), though the film does end with an annoying cliché: the kind hearted and fatherly company boss is revealed to be a devious bad guy, the film reducing ideology, systems and power structures to the morality of an evil figurehead. The belief that replacing a monster's head will cause its body to magically transform - indeed, the belief that the head is itself somehow separate from the body - is a fantasy common in cinema.Visually, the film looks great. This was Pixar's big attempt to successfully render fur, wind and hair, a hurdle they had to get out of the way before conquering water, fire, metal and surface reflections with their later films. It's staggering to see how far computer animation has come in such a short space of time. This film's textures, resolutions and animations look positively archaic when compared to Pixar's later efforts. Incidentally, ""Monsters Inc"" is part of a longstanding battle between Pixar and DreamWorks Pictures (founded by Spielberg, Katzenberg and Geffen in the mid 90s). With the surprise success of Pixar's ""Toy Story"", DreamWorks set about discovering Pixar's next project. When their spies learnt of ""A Bugs Life"", DreamWorks therefore rushed out the similarly themed ""Antz"" in an attempt to steal some profits.Next from Dreamworks came ""The Prince of Egypt"" and ""The Road to El Dorado"", two animated films designed to rip off Disney's ""Hercules"" and ""Mulan"". Dreamworks' ""Shrek"", a monster flick designed to cash in on Pixar's ""Monster's Inc"", came next, followed by ""Sinbad"", a knock off of Disney's ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"".The battle continued with ""Shark Tale"", Dreamworks' copy of ""Finding Nemo"", ""Megamind"" which copies ""The Incredibles"", and ""Flushed Away"", which mimics ""Ratatouille"". No surprise too that the hero of DreamWorks' ""How to Train Your Dragon"" is called HiccUP, and that the film was the studio's response to Pixar's ""Up"". And so on and on it goes, corporate warfare and artistry dancing their intimate ballet.The point is, ""Shrek"", which was released the same year as ""Monster's Inc"", used a tale of monsters to poke fun at Disney, Pixar and Disney fairy tales, whilst ""Monster's Inc"" celebrates the portals, multidimensional windows and doorways of business magnate Steve Jobs' ""Apple Computers"" (Jobs was chief executive of Pixar). What's interesting, though, is that ""DreamWorks"" is now turning the brand awareness generated by its crappy early animations into giant ""cash cow sequels"" (""Shrek 2 and 3"", ""Kung Fu Panda 2"", ""Madagascar 2 and 3"", ""How to Train your Dragon 2"" etc), whilst Pixar, now fully absorbed by the Disney Machine, has sold out and become a monster of its own, milking their early projects with the planned releases of ""Cars 2"", ""Monsters Inc 2"" etc etc.8.5/10 – The takeover has already started. Pixar is turning into the very monster it rallies against in this film. Today it exemplifies what Robert Pfaller calls ""interpassivity"", performing our indictments for us whilst allowing us to consume with impunity.Worth three viewings."
"10 reasons why ""Monsters, Inc."" was robbed by ""Shrek"" at the Oscars:1. The writing holds together better - there isn't a single wasted bit in the movie, from the simulation at the beginning to the seemingly pointless croaky-voiced martinet for paperwork who turns out to be... but that would be telling.2. The humour is less scatological and more character-based.3. The animation is so effective that it's hard to believe it's animation (two highlights are Sullivan's sleigh ride down a snowy mountain at night and the door chase climax - door chase? Just see the movie)...4. ...but the movie never gives you a chance to just wind up being amazed at how it looks and forget about how it feels.5. It doesn't try and impress you with its pop-culture references and how clever it is generally (there is a restaurant called Harryhausen's, but that doesn't really count).6. The voice performances; one of the tests of a cartoon is if the voice cast isn't distracting, and save the Abominable Snowman (voice of John ""Cliff Clavin"" Ratzenberger) that isn't the case. Kudos all round, but particularly Crystal, Goodman, Coburn, and Bonnie Hunt as the aforementioned martinet (see #1).7. Only one ""proper"" song, and even then it's by the great Randy Newman.8. The relationship between Sullivan and Boo (the little girl who gets into Monstropolis) is genuinely touching.9. The end credits not only feature always welcome ""outtakes"" but also follow up a plot strand from the movie itself.10. No DreamWorks tit-for-tat pokes.But then, they don't need to - movies like ""Toy Story,"" ""A Bug's Life,"" ""Toy Story 2"" and this one speak for themselves."
"Released almost back-to-back with ICE AGE, both films had basically carbon copied plots of each other. I doubt they did it on purpose, but they are almost the exact same thing. The two short films included on the VHS and DVD, MIKE'S NEW CAR and FOR THE BIRDS were not very good, but MONSTERS, INC. was truly a masterpiece.While I wouldn't go as far as to call it one of the top 250 movies, it was still very good. There was a lot of adult humor in the film, which made it easier for me to watch the movie, but this is still aimed more for kids. I usually enjoy Pixar movies because they usually try to include a little bit of everything in their movies (and thankfully they leave out the stupid, annoying songs included in so many kids' movies). TOY STORY was their first movie, and then they dished out A BUG'S LIFE, TOY STORY 2, and most recently FINDING NEMO. Their main big plot of almost all of these films though, is getting old. It is amazing that kids haven't noticed that all of their favorite Pixar films have the *exact* same plot in all of them. Dreamworks's SHREK was a change of pace only because it was a parody, but almost all of Pixar's flicks are about some friends trying to get somewhere to rescue somebody or something almost exactly like that. Either way, MONSTERS, INC. was still a very good movie as it did complete the one major feat that a lot of films are not able to do nowadays: Entertain people.MONSTERS, INC. gets 5/5."
"... when it comes to producing well-rounded, realised and consistently entertaining movies.  Is it just me or have there been no REALLY awful animated films from the stables of the top studios like Pixar and Dreamworks, etc?  The movie industry as a whole should perhaps sit up and take notice of the craft that goes into these movies.  Both 'suits' and audiences are sure to benefit if that ever happens.  Long may the tradition of quality animated movies be, I say!   I actually bought a ticket for this last night after finding to my dismay that another premiere, ""From Hell"", was already sold out by the time I arrived.  These are certainly two distinctly different films in theme!  I was slightly grouchy, because, coupled with that minor disappointment, I'd had an argument with a friend on the way over to the theatre, and was now proceeding solo.  I wouldn't say that ""Monsters Inc"" made me glad I missed ""From Hell"", but I still got a solidly entertaining film for my money.  I just hope I don't miss ""Ocean's 11"" next week...   For every plus-point to the movie I can also think of a criticism, but on the whole the good points JUST outweigh the bad.  The setup may be a little too complicated for younger audiences and the supporting cast of voices is wasted.  There was definitely not enough Steve Buscemi, whose bad guy just seemed like an afterthought to all the Keystone Cops esque capers of trying to get ""Boo"" out of Monstropolis.  The script is pitched at a much younger level than ""Toy Story"" was, and so as a result adults may be bowled over by the animation, but slightly starved in the belly-laughs department.  That said, there are still a couple of moments guaranteed to have older patrons guffawing heartily, just not enough for my liking.  Even without laughter, the story is still diverting and inventive enough to fix your attention satisfactorily.  The movie really comes into its own when the kid is introduced, as thereafter the action rarely pauses for breath.   Good as the voice talents of Goodman and Crystal are, it is undoubtedly youngster Mary Gibbs who inadvertently steals the show.  Her cute gurgles and shrieks are enough to put a smile on most people's faces and warm their hearts.  The job the team did on collecting all her voice samples for the finished movie is nothing short of amazing; indeed, just like the animation achievements were as well.  Goodman excels in his voice acting, making ""Sulley"" a truly memorable character.   The animation is wonderful, and at times will make you unable to do anything else but gawp.  Techniques in this arena seem to be moving at lightspeed, and in just a few years will make the graphics seen in ""Toy Story"" seem unremarkable.  Just for this factor alone, ""Monsters Inc."" deserves to be seen, but the likeable (if not always best used) cast and the imaginative plot add an extra dimension that make it worth your time. Nowhere near a ""Toy Story"" beater for sheer polish and appeal to all ages, but a commendable effort nonetheless.  Well done!   
   Altogether now... ""Put-that-thing-back-where-it-came-from-or-so-help-me..."" !"
"I wish Jimmy could animate and write this film but no every time i call him he says he is busy. HOw can you be busy you don't have a job or a life. When I was your age, I had three divorces and five kids. You don't even have a cat. I ate my first cat to show it my ownership over."
A weird but also wise plot.The monsters that use their voices and appearance to scare children and this provides their energy.Wonderful voice cast by the veterans.A must see for the whole family.
Rating9/10Appealing comedy adventure for kids and adults alike. Despite slightly dated animation the script isn't dated at all. Has a great voice cast and an emotional conclusion.Highly recommended
"Monsters, Inc is a movie to see with family or your siblings. It is about two monsters, Mike and Sulley, who work in a factory where their job is to scare children to have electric energy. From here a fantastic adventure will start with a little girl, Boo, who will make Mike and Sulley understand that they don't have to act like they used to do in the past. This movie will make you cry, will make you laugh and at the same time it will give you a moment with your family. So, we can actually say that this time Pixar totally made a masterpiece."

"After 18 years, Monsters Inc still holds up, which is impressive for an animated film. The humor still lands, it's still adorable and fun. Boo is a little creepy looking now but aside from that holds up really well.The only thing really holding it back is that it doesn't seem to have a real strong message. Maybe I just missed it, but most Pixar movies have at least one significant message to them and in Monsters Inc I just wasn't getting the same depth to that."
A good flick for a rainy day. I think the expert casting was the best part.
Jokes are very funny. Really funny. And this looks good.
"I can't see anything bad on this one. Should have won over Shrek but I really don't mind, both are my entire childhood"
"Silly parody of classic monster movies, and now with monsters in a factory afraid of humans. Be sure to watch this on a huge screen, and good Dolby speakers. You can feel the pain of making Monsters, Inc. with all the fur, scales and very detailed backgrounds."
"Thought this was funny and cute, the monsters are adorable and played out well. If is definitely one for the kids!"
When i was young we didn't have wi-fi or any network and that was one of the doenloaded movies in our computer so i watched it with my little brother and sister over and over again and it never became boring. Pixar always makes the best animations btw luv <3 Mike Wazowski.
"It's a lovely film filled with a whole new world of charming characters mainly in Boo the kid, Sully And Mike. They being the central characters bring so much charm in this movie. Its a whole new world out there with these scary looking monsters. The animation, the camerawork and the characterisation is pitch perfect. Infact its my favourite animated movies now right up there with Toystory. Magnificent. 8/10"
"The best way to describe this movie in one word is; fun! ""Monsters, Inc."" is a movie you can easily fall in love with. It has some great fun character, some awesome moments and some well placed comical moments. ""Monsters, Inc."" is entertainment at its bests.The voice cast is amazing. John Goodman and Billy Crystal form a great leading duo. Steve Buscemi is a great villain and James Coburn has a great voice that fits his character perfectly. John Ratzenberger as always is very entertaining this time in a role as banished Yeti.The story itself is pretty simple but thats what makes it easy to follow and so much fun to watch. The movie not only knows how to entertaining but also knows how and when to emote. The combination of fun and emotional things is perfectly balanced and placed within the movie.There is some great dialog but the true power of ""Monsters, Inc."" are the wonderful characters. Not is there only a wild variety of strange and weird characters but also some characters that are good for some serious laughs and Boo is simply adorable and a pretty fair representation of a kid in real life. Well done Pixar!Pure entertainment for the entire family!"
"It has a creative plot of monsters scaring children so that they can power their city and how they work in an office environment. The characters, animation, and said plot are great. My favorite characters are Mike, Sulley, Celia, and Boo. The humor is hilarious, the title sequence looks neat, Billy and John are great together, Boo is cute, the plot twist where Waternoose was the one behind Randall's schemes was really surprising, and the music by Randy Newman was excellent!There are some emotional scenes, like when Sulley scares Boo, and when they have to part ways. I know Randall is a funny villain and all, but he is a jerk in my opinion. Anyway, the song ""If I Didn't Have You"" was amazing, and there's more to laughs than scariness, which makes this a really fun movie.
9.5/10"
"Funny, Original (Than Lots of Current Disney Cartoons)"
"Overall Monster's Inc. isn't the best Pixar has to offer but it's still definitely a good time, with funny characters and for the most part strong writing, at least in terms of the characters. The story is fun and full of beautiful colors, the animation is obviously great, the world Pixar has created is fully realized and every detail expertly crafted to match the distinct monster city. There's lots of bombastic action with an overall good solid moral message, Monster's Inc. is always a great time, no matter what age your are."
"Another Pixar classic, this one focuses on the world of monsters and how similar their world is to ours in that it's blue-collar. The main characters are Mike(Billy Crystal) and Sully(John Goodman). Sully is a top scarer at his job and loves what he does. You see their world is powered by the screams of kids and it's his job to help maintain the power they receive by scaring kids.However there's a catch: The monsters think kids are toxic and that touching them can be fatal. Isn't that hilarious? It doesn't help that a little girl makes her way into their world and they have to keep her existence a secret. While struggling to get her home they begin to realize that she's not toxic and that there may be a conspiracy involving their rival Randall(Steve Buschemi) and boss Mr. Waternoose.So yeah, the premise's interesting and leads to a lot of creative jokes. A good one is at the beginning where they're walking to work and one of the monsters they walk past is a slug who goes through a filter on the street and another who accidentally burns his newspaper by sneezing fire.The characters are enjoyable to watch. Mike as a comic relief's funny and Sully works well as the straight man. It's funny to see them bounce off each other while also seeing them talk about serious matters like the situation about the little girl nicknamed ""Boo"". Randall's an interesting villain. The way he moves is cool and his design is interesting.Monsters Inc. is a great movie to watch. It has something for everyone both kids and adults. I don't have much else to say other check it out for yourself. It's another Pixar classic."
"Without giving the name of the author, Canadian social commentator Mark Steyn cited a piece of writing during a 2012 interview with an American cable-TV company which was about how children perceive the world around them through the fiction they're exposed to early on in life. Principally, he cites an analysis made by a fellow-Canadian on how creatures, or 'monsters', on television, or in cutesy books, were damaging to kids - it imparted the idea that monsters were just cute, cuddly friends that needed taming or befriending. Steyn seemed to prefer 'classic' children's literature in this respect, because there you garner a '...far greater sense of the realities of life from the Brothers Grimm than you will from the Cookie Monster.'I wonder what either of them thought of ""Monsters Inc."", where the one infant character in the film is completely unafraid of precisely the sorts of post-Sesame Street monsters the article cited, yet is a character in a piece imparting the idea that cute and cuddly is good. To some extent, Disney's 2002 animation plays like a kind of animated therapy for young children, who will of course love the colour; vibrancy and sense of adventure infused throughout ""Monster's Inc."", but will also have one of their fears exorcised - that of the dark bedroom at night-time and the idea a creature might lurk beyond a visible realm.At the core of the film is a quite brilliant idea: in an alternate world running parallel to our own, there exist actual creatures, hideous in physicality, desperately in need of the terrified screams of young children so as to run their civilisation. In order to do so, they appear in bedroom closets around the world late at night (the only gateway from our own universe to theirs); do what they have to do to induce sheer panic and return home again having captured the noise in a canister. One of the film's best jokes, in fact, doubles up as a devilish social commentary on how much harder it is these days to truly frighten children, given what they are often exposed to on TV and in video games.The scream-drive is propelled by two monsters called Sully and Randall, whose physical characteristics are cleverly echoed by their voice-talents: Sully, like John Goodman, is big and huggable and has a dopey voice, whilst Steve Buscemi's lizard-like creation is more slender and bug-eyed. Sully is the consummate professional who goes through the same process every morning: exercising and scare routines with his flat-mate and floor-work partner Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal). He blindly trusts the corporation, epitomised quite cleverly in the arachnid-like CEO Henry J. Waternoose (James Coburn), who sports a waist-coat but is tragically missing a monocle. Children are Sully's worst enemy, believing them to be potentially toxic. Regardless, he puts his life on the line every day for his society - the moral justification for all this lies in the company's motto: 'We scare, because we care'.As each of the monsters in the company lumbered with this responsibility walk to their posts in slow motion, the film invokes Michael Bay's 1998 film ""Armageddon"", which infers a sense of doom or catastrophe if these brave souls were to fail in their duty: these people are the guardians of civilisation. Civilisation does not quite crumble, but disaster strikes when a young American child manages to make its way out of our world and into the monsters' own - enough to have Sully and Mike worried their days are numbered as previous misnomers have led to other monsters banished to our world, cleverly accounting for Bigfoot and the Yeti. In a panic, the twosome concoct a plan to return it to where it belongs, but that becomes problematic when Sully becomes attached to it.""Monsters Inc."" cracks along at a fantastic pace and works so wonderfully well because of a number of things. Principally, the stakes are incredibly high, so there is always this rapid, even nervous, energy pulsating through the film once the 20 minute mark elapses, and the film does such a wonderful job in bringing the two personalities in the form of its heroes to life in such a short space of time that we are hooked on their adventure the whole way. Furthermore, the characterisation is superb - these are rounded characters with lives; dreams; goals and even girlfriends - they possess different attitudes; physical appearances and characteristics. The world it creates, that of one parallel to our own, is extraordinary from a design perspective - the way they echo one another in the form of a daily commute; workplace rivalry; a relaxing meal after work and generally the things you see out and about is marvellous.What directors Pete Docter; David Silverman and Lee Unkrich later pull off is the incredibly tricky transition the film needs to make from being a double-act comedy about getting rid of something which doesn't want to leave, to being a film about foiling a corporate conspiracy. One cannot laud the team enough. Laudable too is the character study - this is Sully's film; a character who blindly trusts the machine at the beginning of the film but undergoes his own journey to find out that kids are not toxic; corruption might come from anywhere and even tackles the moral dilemma of how to power his world. Irrespective of age, and with whomever you see it, ""Monster's Inc."" is a genuinely infectious and wholesome piece of animated entertainment."
"It's such an odd premise for a movie, but yet it works so well. What if the monsters hiding in your closet are real and what if they have a society of their own, behind that door. What would that society look like and what part the scaring of little children would play in it.You can definitely build a movie around that and Pixar does so beautifully. In the process we get introduced to James P. ""Sulley"" Sullivan and Michael ""Mike"" Wazowski, the top scaring duo Monsters, Inc. has ever seen. Things go well, until a little girl child, adorably and promptly named Boo, slips through the door. Hijinks do indeed ensue.The movie has a strong idea and some topnotch characters going for it. I thoroughly enjoyed the relationship between Sully and Boo. The rest of the cast are voiced by some really talented people and all of the main cast have really great designs as well. I especially enjoyed Henry J. Waternoose III, the CEO. The side and background characters looked a bit more generic and blobbish in contrast, which is a shame, but then again they're not the focus.The only real flaw the film has is the story. It's not bad by any means, but it is not as strong as the other elements. Status quo is king, something upsets the status quo, hijinks, solution. No real surprises, no great stakes. I would have liked to explore the world a bit more or move beyond the obvious bad guy good guy setups.Still, a great animation film for all ages. Definitely worth a watch."
