"Knowing the real-life story behind it, Hachiko: A Dog's Story (2009) has been made in a sort of staged documentary style, similar to the kind of movies often seen on documentary channels (e.g. NatGeo), however without a narrator so common in documentaries, and including well-known actors (Richard Gere, Sarah Roemer and Joan Allen), making it more suitable for theatrical distribution.Before my last year's visit to Tokyo I've been unaware of the true-life story this movie is based upon. In time an occasion came up to meet a friend in Shibuya city, contemporary center of Tokyo's youth culture (shopping, fashion, nightlife...), and that's how I've learned about the popular local meeting point for all Tokyoites, the Hachik≈ç Akita dog statue just outside of Shibuya Train Station, but the real story behind it has been still eluding me ever since. After seeing this movie, and some additional research on the web, all pieces have fallen into place.In retelling the story of common bonding between the dog and its owner, so usual that it comes so natural, film is moving at slow pace, following events of an ordinary life, though not without occasional comedic and dramatic overtones. Even past the dramatic highpoint, when common acts of affection and loyalty evolve towards such an unheard-of faithfulness and ultimate devotion, pace of the storytelling does not change, relying primarily on fine details and emotional build-up. Of course, this might not attract everybody, providing that majority of movie audience today is highly dependent on fast paced, action packed scenes, getting thrills from 3D CG stylized ambiance and suspense, high volume amplitudes and aggressive, often rude highlights of any other nature. However, for those who can do without it, and keep alive their interest even in a simple story, who won't shy away from emotional involvement (as if this can be controlled), they shall easily find themselves consumed by its mere beauty and warmth. Usual man's-best-friend story, spiced with an intriguing yet inspiring detail, shall leave you a bit sad, inevitably pensive, but ultimately delighted. Even more so after the reading of the real-life epilogue."
Well what can i say. I'm a guy i don't cry about movies i know its fake but i gotta say this one caught me by surprise even tho id watched the trailer and read a few reviews already. by the end of the movie i was in tears absolutely broken down crying my eyes out. and saying that i probably haven't shed a tear in about 8 years for anything but i love dogs and this is the most amazing story I've ever seen this is probably the best movie I've seen in about 10 years and i have seen almost everything.as u can prob tell i would advise everyone to see this and stop and think for a moment if we all cared for each other like we know we should like this movie teaches us wouldn't the world be a better place?
"I'm not at all an emotional person,but this movie really touched me,i couldn't even stop crying after 15 minutes from the final.I just sat on my armchair,and started to cry. This movie,teaches us first of all about love,there is no power bigger than love,nothing compares to this strong feeling. I'm really objective when it comes about movies,and honestly no one till now,have cut me as deep. It's surprising...but true,that everything in this world,is ruled by love,and if you thought that only humans are aware of this,you did wrong. I liked the performance,i loved the music(it was so so calm)So glad to see this film,and i truly recommend it for everyone,i'm really sure you will enjoy it."
"Hachi is a movie based on the true story about a dog in Japan, Hachiko, who would wait at the train station every day for his owner to arrive even after the owner passed away.I have never seen the original Japanese version of the movie but know the story well as I have been told by many people here in Japan. There is a statue of Hachiko that stands outside of Shibuya Station in Tokyo. Now the statue is the most popular place for Tokyoites to meet their friends before going out shopping or dining in Shibuya.Unlike other Japanese remakes, this movie actually gives credit to the original story so that you don't get the sense that Hollywood wants to call it its own. All actors/actresses in the movie do a superb job in making you feel as if you were a part of the community embracing the dog. Compared to the original story, people were more accepting of Hachi rather than considering him a nuisance. Of course this is going to be released in the U.S. as a holiday movie so the goal is to make it uplifting.Just a warning, do take many tissues. I am a grown man and can honestly say that I have never really cried during a movie. I think the score of the movie plus the dog being so adorable made me lose myself. When I looked around the theater though, every single person was crying and I saw a lot of red eyes as I left the Men's restroom. Any movie that can make me do that deserves a 10/10."
"I just saw this movie today, and I'm so glad I did.It is based on a true story and it's only natural that the movie is great because the real story itself is very touching. One of the things that sets this movie apart from the other movies that involve animals is how they stuck to reality instead of throwing in some a-little-hard-to-believe elements here and there just to make it more entertaining.Sometimes they show things through Hachi's eyes as opposed to human eyes, which helps you relate to him and understand how he felt and what he thought then, as well as emphasizes that Hachi is the main character of the movie.This is not just a kids' movie. In the end everyone including myself was crying because we were so moved. It is a must-see."
"Well, I just came back from seeing this in Shinjuku earlier and I can honestly say that I have NEVER seen so many people crying at the end of a movie.... it really is a sad story.However, it's also a heartwarming tale of loyalty, about how people and dogs are more than just friends and, I guess most of all, about how a dog's love for its master never fades - even after his/her death!Richard Gere was fantastic in this movie, he bonded really well with the dog and it never felt like watching an actor at all - it genuinely seemed to be a movie with his own dog! I highly recommend this to people of all ages. There are enough bits to laugh at (seeing Richard Gere teaching his dog to play 'fetch' was brilliant!) and the story is portrayed really well (even if there were some changes made to the original Japanese tale)"
"Finally a film without explosions, computer graphics, and violence. A family film with a message. Adults will relate to the story of life-long friendship and loyalty. Children will love the ""dog story"" A tender story will huge box office potential. The possible ""sleeper hit"" of the holidays. Pet lovers everywhere will relate to this film and will leave theaters in tears. A weepy, wonderful film about the bond that develops between one man and a dog after a chance meeting at a train station. Bring extra tissues! Based on a true story, this film was shot mostly in Woonsocket, Rhode Island at a historic old train station. Beautifully shot and edited. The film runs less than 2-hours. The film generally adheres to the actual true story of a dog in Japan. The dog became a national treasure and a monument was erected to honor him."
"Finally a film from the USA (albeit based on a true story in the 1920s Japan) that is without guns, explosions and free of violence and not based at all on romantic elements!""Love and Loyalty"" succinctly sums up the film. The love so simple, so pure and the loyalty so unfailing, so steadfast that it would melt any steel heart. I was so embarrassed that as soon as the film came to the end I dashed straight into the loo only to see my eyes sore red (!!)The main characters never ""take flight"" but that matters not at all. It's the simple story of the love between a man and his best friend that more than sufficiently works all the wonders. Not a sad one, but profoundly touching, So touching that even a tough guy like me couldn't possibly hold his tears.Hachiko, the Akita dog, has set the Yardstick of loyalty under which all loyalty among us human beings are to be measured. Loyalty that is truly monumental. Loyalty that is to be surpassed only by God Himself.A must-watch film, especially for all dog lovers. Highly recommended for all families and people of all ages."
"I think at the end of the day, what matters in a movie is how different it leaves you after you've watched it. It could be technically brilliant and leave you in amazement about how a narrative can be structured, leave you thinking about an issue from a totally unique perspective or just leave you thinking.But if you believe that the impact a movie has on you is important - you cannot afford to miss this movie. I've never written a review in the past 7-8 years of using IMDb but signed up just so I could say how much I loved this movie.I read a couple of reviews talk about crying during the movie and thought it odd. I can't remember the last time I cried during a movie - but towards the last 15 minutes of the movie I didn't only cry - I cried from the depth of my heart, not out of sadness but from a much deeper sense of realization the power of true love and how it can manifest itself. You hear so many times that there is 'God' in all of us if we can realize it - at the end of this movie you will know why it's true.It's a must watch movie."
"Its really hard to articulate when you have so much to write and so little words to express. And even lesser words which could actually help you convey what you want to say. The closest word which comes to my mind in this case is 'stupendous'.Hachiko is a true story about a dog in Japan and the special bond he shared with a professor whom he met when it was a little puppy. The story has been put forward exceptionally well by the cast and the director.The movie has been kept extremely simple with minimum effort on the scenes, yet remarkably you are kept spellbound after a couple of minutes into the movie. And as the other reviews suggest, making the whole theater grab onto their tissues explains how good it really is.Lastly, coming for someone who also rates 'Eight below' as one of his favorite's, a high rating of Hachiko would seem a little biased to many. But in my honest opinion I don't think that anybody who has watched this movie can rate it below 10."
"I first knew about ""Hachiko: A Dog's Story"" because of Sarah Roemer, my favorite actress. When I read more about this movie and found out that Richard Gere and Joan Allen were in the cast too, I was really excited.I saw the movie on 29 Setember at ""Festival do Rio de Janeiro"" and I loved it! It's really powerful and touching. I loved how they showed the dog's vision in black & white.The only thing that I didn't like at all was that the characters seems to ""never take flight"". I know Parker (Richard Gere) and the dog Hachiko are the main characters, but I think that the other characters could have been explored a bit more. But I do understand why it wasn't done.If you are a dog person, you will definitely love this movie! It's a sad, beautiful story that touches everyone's heart! A must-see."
Saw this movie while traveling in Belarus it brought me to my knees this was a show of the ages and without question a Richard Gere classic and performance of a lifetime this show will be Seen for Years and lifetimes to come I have been back in the U.S. for 2 weeks now and tell everyone about it I think of it many times a day it was yes----that good this is a movie You will never ever forget or get it out of your mind and heart will see it again when it opens in the US in December you may think this is a over statement but when you leave the theater it will be a known fact you will remember this show for ever it was and is a classic forever and a true story to boot...... wow.
"I have watched some touching and moving movies in my lifetime and about 2 movies have made me cry, However i was crying my eyes out when i was watching this Hachiko movie. I was crying for a good 10 -15 minutes even after this movie ended. I have browsed through the comments and reviews on this IMDb board and on other online forums and have noticed that so many other people who watched this movie have also cried. I really think NO OTHER MOVIE has made so many people cry. Whenever i saw Hachiko go to the station and sit there waiting oblivious to the fact his owner died, my heart died a little each time.Knowing that this movie was actually based on a real life story set in the 1920s-1930s in Tokyo whereby an Akita-breed dog waited in front of the Shibuya train station day by day around the same time at the same spot for NINE WHOLE YEARS for his beloved university professor Professor Ueno to come back from work, really breaks my heart.No animal or human would ever sit in front of the station to wait for someone they love for THIS LONG (9 FREAKING YEARS). This dog Hachiko must have had such ENORMOUS love for his owner that he would throw his life away (9 years is like 7 decades in dog years) waiting in front of the station at the RIGHT TIME each day.How clever are dogs? Real-life Hachiko somehow knew how to read the time in order to wait at the station at the same time everyday for 9 years. Waiting for 9 years- wow! I never knew that the extent of an animal's LOVE and DEDICATION and PERSISTENCE could reach those heights.In real life, Hachiko's was given away after his master's death, but he routinely escaped, showing up again and again at his old home. This showed that Hachiko loved his original owners (Ueno and his wife and kids) too much to let go of his master Ueno or his memory of him and wanted to return to his remaining living owners. Eventually, Hachiko's apparently realized that his Professor Ueno no longer lived at the house. So he went to look for his master at the train station where he had accompanied him so many times before. How smart and clever is that of a dog? The other original owners of Hachiko had moved to a different location and Hachiko could not find his other living original owners since he is a dog and so he decided to wait in front of the railway station like he always used to do for his master to turn up and be reunited with him, This real life story of Hachiko clearly demonstrated UNDYING, UNCONDITIONAL LOVE FOR ANOTHER since both the PHYSICAL ABSENCE of his owner Professor Ueno and the PASSING OF TIME would not diminish Hachiko's love and UNFLINCHING LOYALTY for his original master Ueno. This real life story also reminds us about HOW LOVE CAN MAKE ANYONE (INCLUDING ANIMALS AND DOGS) do CRAZY THINGS for someone they love.Somehow I just wished that in real-life, the wife and family of Professor Ueno should have just placed lifeless body of Professor Ueno on the floor for a while for Hachiko to sniff and inspect the body. This might sound crazy to all you people reading this but i believe that dogs know about life and death and would be able to tell if a fellow dog or a human is dead. I am quite sure that Hachiko, being clever enough to wait at the station at the same time everyday for 9 years, would be able to figure out that Ueno was dead. Then this would have given Hachiko at least CLOSURE, then he would not have to wait for 9 years. You can read up on the real life story of Hachiko in this Wikipedia page which also lists all the Japanese films made about Hachiko. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hachiko Or you can just Yahoo! Or Google Hachiko's real life story for more information."
"This is my first ever review. I have been a reader of user reviews on IMDb for a few years and this is the first time I felt I had to write something about a film. I will try and not spoil the film for you. The film is based on a real story which took place in Japan from 1923-1935 about a dog named Hachiko who used to wait for his master's return at the train station everyday for 9 years even after his master passed away. That's the basic plot, the rest you just have to see to actually feel the story.Just finished watching this movie yesterday and still can't get it out of my head. A feeling of sadness has engulfed me after watching this. I am at a loss for words to describe this movie as no other movie has ever touched me so deeply. I was pretty much crying and sobbing the entire second half of the film and by the time it was over, it brought me down to my knees.Richard Gere was at his usual best but the real highlight of the film was the acting of the dogs. They were incredible in how they were able to portray the range of emotions through their facial expression and body language. The music throughout the film was brilliant too and that helped in driving home the felling of sadness and loneliness that Hachi went through.I had a dog too and it brings back memories of how sad and depressed I felt for a month after he passed away. I have experienced such undying, unconditional love and loyalty from my dog too and it made this movie extra special for me. If there was ever a movie that I will remember for the rest of my life, this has to be it. This is a must see for any person with a heart and soul. I know I am a better person today after watching this and I am confident it might also have the same effect on some of you. Thanks for reading and do take care whoever you are. Love your dogs and always remember that he will always be there for you even in your darkest, loneliest hours."
"I don't think you find a better example of a dog's devotion to his master than this one, a based-on-a-true-life tale of a dog who was into a routine of meeting his beloved male owner every day at 5 p.m. at the train station.I saw this movie a week ago and I still can't get it out of my mind. If the words ""love"" and ""loyalty"" mean anything to you, this is a nice story see unfold.The only major mistake made in this movie is that it should have been done as a 1920s period piece. I say that because throughout the story, the dog runs free around the town/city, which is impossible today with leash laws everywhere.Whatever, the story is still very good, very memorable and very touching in spots near the end. The only spoiler I'll use is a good one: if you fear watching an animal film with a bad/sad ending, you're safe: the dog survives....that's all I'll say on that.Kudos to Richard Gere for a nice performance. This is definitely not he kind of film he usually does but he explains in a bonus feature, ""I read the script, cried, and couldn't say no."" The story was too good for him to pass up. That's my recommendation to you: go rent the DVD, sit back and enjoy a nice memorable tale of man's best friend."
"Well I'm a man of few words i don't review movies and i Don't cry.Not after seeing this movie, i felt a need to pass some type of judgement on it.Im a dog person so the title caught my eye i had no idea what it was about or if there was any truth behind the story until just before the credits.From the second the Akita pup came on screen and the bond was so clearly apparent, i was in tears, not once during this film can i honestly say my eyes were dry.For remake of a Japanese film its outstanding no guns no big bangs and no cars on 2 wheels, no fancy CGI apart from the seasons change scene outside the station.Well done and bravo again for a superb movie.We could all learn something from this movie!"
"This is one of the best films that I have ever watched, it is the most heartwarming and yet the most heart wrencking movie, can't recall any film have such emotional impact on me. I still keep thinking about the story and every time when I think about it, I felt sad and so sorry for both the Prof and the dog, I am sure this is a film I won't forget ... the soundtrack is another praise.., definitely a classic for Richard Gere.. Although the movie centered on the bond/love between Hachi and his human parent, this is also a story about love between spouse, love between friends, father-daughter love and most of all, a close knit community of people with a big heart...My favourite scene is where Mrs Wilson come back to town after 10 years and found Hachi still waiting, so touching I can't control my tears... the closing scene is just devastating, Hachi died still dreaming of his master coming out of the train station.....This is a must see movie for every dog lovers. For human, dogs may just be a part of our life, but for the dog(s), we are everything they got. Again, Richard Gere is just superb and natural, so did Joan Allen. And lastly the dogs are so cute and adorable.A truly remarkable wait - 10 years... words failed to describe the amount of love, devotion and loyalty Hachi had for Parker..."
"If your date is late an hour or so , you would most likely leave. You wouldn't wait 2 or 3 hours , let alone a day for he or she. Think about it, would you wait all your life for someone to return. Over time we tend to forget, and move on with our lives. That's in our nature, We humans have the tendency to forget. This story is great portrayal of a Dog who's whole revolves around one man, Parker. Its a simple story told in a simple manner, yet it nearly brought tears to my eyes. The scene of Mrs. Parker returning to the town, and finding old and tired Hachiko still waiting explodes the screen with raw emotion.I have a dog, and he doesn't fetch either.Mans best friend has never been a man.SEE the movie............"
"Wow, I joined this site to write a review on this amazing film. I walked into the video store this evening and grabbed it at random because of the dog on the cover and Richard Gere. I just had a feeling.What can I say, no other film has touched me as much as this and I don't think one ever will. Its off the scale. Its starts off slow but it quickly turns into such an endearing film, it makes you think about things you take for granted and a dog does this better than any actor.I'm a grown man, never cry, this film had me fighting back tears because I didn't want people to see me, I went to the bathroom and balled my eyes out after it. I even joined this site to encourage more people to watch it.If you have to see one film in your life time, see this.It breaks all barriers. I was going to make a backup of it, but I want to reward the amazing people who made this film by buying it.I don't think I can ever sit through this film again, but I want it on my shelf as a wonderful reminder.Honestly, this is a film that I will never forget and one I will encourage people to watch at any given opportunity.This film will make any human being cry."
I considered myself a stoned heart person when it comes to watching emotional movies but not until I saw this movie. I am a 30 year old grown up and for the first time in my life I cant stopped myself crying. I never ever cried before during a movie but this movie is exceptional and I will not forget this movie whole my life.I don't like dogs and I am a big time Cat lover but the scenes were extremely emotional and I am thinking that it would be better if I avoided this movie. I know one thing I ll become sad whenever I remember this movie in my life and I have a deep impact of this movie.Its the most Emotional and Sad movie I have ever seen and I am sure it will remain the most emotional movie ever.I give this movie 10/10 for proving me wrong that I cant Cry!
"In Bedridge, Professor Parker Wilson (Richard Gere) finds an abandoned dog in the train station and brings the dog home with the intention of returning the animal to its owner. He finds that the dog is an Akita and names it Hachiko; however, nobody claims the dog and his family decides to keep Hachi. Along the years, the popular Hachi waits for Wilson in the square in front of the station. When Wilson dies at school, Hachi keeps waiting for his owner along the years until the day the meet each other. I was quite anxious waiting for the release of ""Hachiko: A Dog's Story"" on DVD. I had read in the newspaper the story of the Japanese dog that had waited for nine years for his deceased owner in the 20's in Japan and I expected a good adaptation of this story of loyalty and love by Lasse Hallstr√∂m. This melodramatic movie has a great cast, with Richard Gere, Joan Allen and the dogs that should be nominated to the Oscar with their expressions and acting, better than many actors and actresses that we frequently see on the screen. Be ready for tears and bring handkerchiefs and tissues together with the popcorn to the sofa, and watch a really beautiful movie with your family. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Sempre ao Seu Lado"" (""Always at Your Side"")"
"I watched this film with no preconceptions and not really knowing much about the story beforehand. All I knew was that it was based on real events in Japan. I deliberately didn't read the blurb on the DVD case because I wanted to ""discover"" the story for myself.I have always owned and loved dogs. Some people love their cats but I'm amongst the many who just really care for their pet dogs. Now I won't spoil the story for you except to say that after a bit of a slow start this film draws you in. As another poster said...it will teach you much about the quality of love and loyalty.I can only warn you to have plenty of tissues on hand because if you are a human being with functioning emotions you are going to cry...a lot! I am a fifty year-old ""grumpy old man"" but I bawled like a baby for nearly half an hour after watching this film. I also let my Staffordshire Terrier come up onto my lap (and she is VERY heavy) and I hugged her for an age! I will never look at a dog the same way again after seeing this film and I will treasure it for as long as God allows me to live."
"I do not feel a need to summarize this movie as many others have done this already, but I do want to tell you my and my family's reaction to it.Last night we were all sitting in our living room, piled up on our couch, huddled under blankets with our two loyal dogs snuggled up with us. First half of the movie we are all feeling warm and fuzzy, laughing at the familiar goings on between owner and faithful dog. Second half of the movie, after owner dies, I get a big sore lump in my throat that won't go away. Shortly afterward I hear sniffles all around. Our dogs get bigger hugs. Tears begin to stream down my cheeks. Full out sobs by the end of the movie. Light go on. Not a dry eye in the house.The day after, I woke up with tears in my eyes. My son is still crying. My 17 year old daughter is mad at me for showing her such a sad movie. But their dad is reading all about Hachiko on the internet and I am writing a review about the movie (which I never do).This is a truly wonderful movie that will leave you feeling sad, but in a good way. But beware, my kids loved it but ultimately wished they had not seen it as it made them too sad.Cinematically well made. Slow moving but not boring. Kudos all around."
"I saw this movie again for the sixth time and I'm still crying. How on earth does someone decides to put this as a short shelf life and not consider this movie to come out during the Xmas holiday. You have two superb actors, Richard Gere and Joan Allen. Can you get better than that. Shame on the film industry. I couldn't get my own brothers to watch this film for a second time. They were so heart wrenched in watching it the first time around. The music, the dog and the acting made this film possible. I saw it six times and every time I saw it, I cried. It's based on a true story and everyone I know that has seen it, can't have enough tissues handy. You chose Marley & Me to come out during the holidays and while I liked it and read the book, there is no comparison. This was a beautiful movie in every which way.This is an amazing story about loyalty and unconditional love. I saw the Japanese version of it and while it was very good, I stilled loved the US version of it. I don't know what possessed the film industry to ignore putting this film on the silver screen because it was so beautifully well written and the music was amazing. I believe this movie came out when Marley and Me did, and while I enjoyed Marley and Me, there were more lessons to be learned by this movie and not by a precocious dog, but one who was truly loyal. I guess because it was based on a true story, it makes it all the more heart wrenching that something like this actually happened. If you're a dog lover, you will love this film, because you could associate yourself with the character that Richard Gere played. He was actually very good, but the accolades go to the dog that played Hachi. I was so mesmerized by this movie, the cast. the music and the dog, that I ordered it from Amazon.com in Blue Ray.Modify review below:"
"We had a dog like this for years and years and I always thought about her as something special. She was simply a gift. No other words can describe the feelings I have for her. So I'm just grateful that these guys made this movie and though it has its cheesy elements, the focus is always on the dog. Which is nice. Talking to friends, telling them the story I had to realise that everyone knows the plot from newspapers, from their memories. I think it tells something about it and I do hope that this breed will be recognized for their faith and amazingly friendly nature. Seeing this movie reminded me of her, of course. Though our dog has already died but I think that this movie is her legacy, too. 10/10"
"How bitter can people be? After reading some negative reviews here, I just felt I had to say something. People who gave this movie low rates because they found it ""boring"" and found technical flaws in it must be kidding!This is one of the best movies I've ever seen (even now, two years later)and it's not a movie for dog lovers only, it's a movie about friendship and it does have an important message to deliver to people of all ages. It has certainly become a classic and it's one of Richard Gere's best performances ever! It sure is a movie I will be showing my kids when they grow up to help me illustrate concepts like ""friendship"", ""dedication"" and ""loyalty""."
"I kept telling myself 'i'm not gonna cry i'm not gonna cry' but in the end the tears just wouldn't hold themselves back.A lovely movie, simple in all of its execution.Also has a lovely score to give the effect to the pain that the dogs character projects, yet in a rather mute way.If you like dogs, or are affected by them in any way at all (for good or bad) you'd feel for this movie too.The characters aren't really deeply explored but then again the movie is purely about the dog and the loyalty it feels for its owner.The rest of it is just a platform for the story to really come out with the truest and most basic of all human emotions.Not a lot of dialogue, but then the dog speaks volumes through its eyes. Lovely story and beautifully told too i'd give it all thumbs up!"
"Hachi is a very special and unique kind of movies, it's a kind of movie that takes you deep inside to a level that you can't get back to finally found yourself crying every time you remembered Hatchi's face while he was crying and waiting for his master especially the part that parker's wife and his friend came back after 10 years and found him still waiting!!! I can't stop crying for about half a hour after this part Also the faces of the dog was killing me inside leaving one question inside me, could there be a loyalty like this between human beings???!!!!Long Life HATCHI ÔÅä"
"i saw this movie in an airplane, i expected some boring movie about a dog or whatever story . when the mother saw the dog after 10 years at the station again , i didn't know how fast i was searching for my sunglasses to hide my eyes.i was crying because of the beautiful story , i was so ashamed if anyone could see me having so much tears all over my face. i think i was just in time finding my sunglasses , nobody noticed my state of emotion while watching this movie. i think other people had the same problem . this movie makes you cry . i don't like dogs around me or near me , but this story was just too dramatic to stay cool and pretend it doesn't get you. the movie keeps going and there are no weak parts.great movie ."
"You can try to watch a movie for every day of the year and all the romantic drams going but nothing I swear will pull at your emotions more than this movie. Oh boy, what a movie and what a story! there are few of us in this life who don't love dogs or had a dog as a pet at some point in our lives. We know the Lassie stories of course.but this is based on a true story and the dog who plays in this movie deserves an Oscar for himself, if ever they give Oscars to canines! Richard Gere, as he was in Amelia, was peripheral but perfect in the companion role for the lost dog he finds at the railway station.You have been warned by others and I am warning you now, call it a spoiler if you like but don't you dare watch this without some back up[ - tissues or hankies at the ready. I am a grown up and I never stopped crying through this movie, its a sad but happy poignant movie at the same time.No blockbusters but it is unmatchable and unmissable entertainment for a movie, top drawer! OK, as with Veronika Decides to Die, they have transferred the story from its original location and having never visited Japan, though living in south east Asia, the film works perfectly. Hachiko is definitely a legend and one day I hope one day I will also visit his statue (I think there is more than one?) thank you for the production for such a delightful film!"
"Based on the true story of a faithful Akita, the titular Hachik≈ç, 'Hachi: A Dog's Tale' An Emotional & Beautiful Film, that will melt your heart. A True-Story about a Dog's loyalty towards his master, even after he dies, left me in tears.'Hachi: A Dog's Tale' Synopsis: A drama based on the true story of a college professor's bond with the abandoned dog he takes into his home.'Hachi: A Dog's Tale' stunned me because of how faithful a pet can be. The dog waited for his deceased master, and never gave up. Hachik≈ç's love & faithfulness to his master, even cinematically, melts your heart & the penultimate portions, are very emotional. I cried! Stephen P. Lindsey's Screenplay is emotional & very touching. Lasse Hallstr√∂m's Direction is heartfelt. Cinematography & Editing, are perfect.Performance-Wise: Hachiko, played by three Akita named Chico', Layla and Forrest ‚Äî each playing a different period in Hachiko's life and his home, are the life of the show. Richard Gere as Hachiko's Master, delivers a lovable performance. Joan Allen does well. Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, Erick Avari & Sarah Roemer are wonderful. Jason Alexander is decent.On the whole, 'Hachi: A Dog's Tale' is a GEM of a film."
"People say that once in a while, some random production house would come up with a movie that will change the way the average movie-goer would watch films. It wouldn't be right to say Hachiko is one such title; because it isn't. But what it does do is make you realize that there is love and faith in this world.I am a movie-buff and have seen enough ""tear-jerkers"" to know what that word means. But it was only with Hachi, did I realize that, at times, when things go dead silent and you have given up hope on yourself, there will be someone or something that will tell you, ""You're not alone."" It made me realize that in today's world, where people complain of backstabbing and disloyalty, this movie will always tell me what it takes to be loyal, and realize what true love is.Watch it. It doesn't matter whether you cry or not at the end of the movie. That's not what the movie attempts to achieve. In fact, I still don't know what this movie's objective is, if any. Anyway, try this out for once. I am pretty sure you won't regret it."
"The first time I know about dog's movie, it was always Lassie. That's the best dog movie I've ever watch.But now, that opinion will change for there's another one that have the same vibe and emotional in some ways. That's Hachiko: A Dog's Story.Now, for all of you who likes Japanese culture, you should probably know about the real story of Hachi, the dog. And right here, at this very movie, you will encounter yet again the depiction of those time back there with Richard Gere as the main lead. So, you want to feel the feeling? Go ahead and watch it. You won't regret it.I couldn't say anything about this movie, except that this one is really a story that can really bring tears to your eyes. That's what happens to me right after I watch it and even better. The emotional feeling, the sentiment atmosphere in this movie, it's really marvelous.The dog is well trained and Richard Gere has proved himself again as a great actor out there. You dog lovers should watch this one.And remember to prepare a lot of tissue to stop your tear running down from your eyes.Great movies. I rate it 10/10"
This indeed is very touching. A real tribute to my beloved darling Jenny's loyalty.I write this in memory of my beloved dog Jenny.She was a darling and beloved of Singh family.She was a princess indeed.Can't forget finding her waiting for me to return from work.Jenny was similar to Hachiko in many ways.Her rejoicing on seeing me back is unforgettable.Her energy was quite endearing.Miss her quite a lot.May her soul rest in peace! - Prof. A. K. Singh awadhesh11@yahoo.co.in
The movie affected me in a way that I can't imagine and express. In my whole life I always wanted to be a strong man maybe for the favor of my family or myself but this time I release all my feelings and start crying to accept the reality of my nature. I am strong and emotional guy and this movie helped me to better know myself. For the first time I watched I was a member of English conversation club and there was hell of crowd. By that time I didn't know anything about the movie. But after the session I couldn't stand there and discuss and run straight home watched it again cried cried and cried until I felt my tears run out. It reminded me my father. After you lost people close to you you understand one thing. No matter how much you wait they are not coming back. The only thing left from them is the memories you have been in together and those memories shapes your personality.
"I'm going to keep this short.I would normally steer clear of this kind of film as I find the saccharine formula hard to swallow. But this got such good reviews that I checked it out despite my better judgement.I've got to say that up to about the halfway mark I was regretting my decision and I was getting a little tired of the perfect family, pleasantville, schmaltzy overdose. And while that still kind of grates on me on some level, it really just serves as a set up for the rest of the movie(the important part) so try not to be put off by that and hang in there, safe in the knowledge that the story only really gets interesting in the 2nd half.I still don't entirely understand why this kind of thing is so touching but clearly it just is and I was crying like a baby by the end of it. So if you've ever had a pet you love and need to evacuate your tear ducts then look no further.Very sweet tribute to the bond twixt man and mutt."
"This film is one of the best films I have seen. I saw many films based on ""True Story"". The actors were great. I felt has if they have been the real people in the real story itself. Hachi....he is a dog that I would like to have. He came with the professor each time to the train and would just come at the right time to pick him up. To me, it was as if Hachi was protecting him. I have so much to say but little words to use. I really wish that there are words to describe how I am feeling. Just at the middle of the movie, I cried. What happened in the movie just came all of a sudden, and we didn't even notice that such a thing can happen. But it can when it comes to stories that begins with a Wonder then joy and then... I'm sure you guys already know this order. Of what happened in this story, i literally hated it. I didn't want such sadness involved in this story but it was. It taught me something that is really hard to teach to others. All I can say is grab some tissues and a pillow to hug because this film will bring out such an emotion that you didn't think will come out.Thank you very much for taking your time to read this review. :)"
"I'll be the first to say I do not cry ever while watching movies (I can count on one hand the times that I have) and when I happened to come across this film today,I figured ""why not?"" It looked like a simple and cute movie about a man finding a dog and giving it a good home. Nothing special...oh how wrong was I.As many others have already stated, ""Hachi: A Dog's Tale"" is a beautiful tale of friendship, love, and devotion. A man who finds a small adorable puppy by accident enters a heartwarming friendship with the animal, who shows the loyalty a dog can have for its owner. Hachi (or Hachiko) is such a devoted and loving dog, following Gere's character to the train station every day and returning one the train whistled for the return of his master. It's truly one of the reasons why I love dogs so much. As time and tragedy occurs, nothing stands in Hachi's way to meet his owner at the train station every day until the end.The film's cast was superb (especially Gere, who also served as a producer) and beautifully shots. A great touch was seeing the world from the dog's POV in an almost sepia filmed shots (as dogs are colorblind). It is such a heartwarming yet heartbreaking story all at the same time! I've seen stories of owners who've passed on and their dogs staying faithfully by their sides (the US soldier whose dog didn't leave his side or the dog who stayed by his Japanese owner's grave). This is just but another example in a film format of the love that animals can bring in a person's life and vice versa.It reminds me of my dog Jett, a jet-black dachshund/rat terrier mix I picked out in elementary school. He was so tiny and I remember petting him thinking ""he's the dog for us."" Years later, I can remember having to take him outside, clean up after him every time he got into the trash or chewed my mom's shoes up, and playing with him at odd hours of the day. But it was my mom whom he bonded with the strongest, following her everywhere she went and waiting for her to play with him or take him outside. He was her constant companion while I was away at college and my sister worked all day and later moved out. Ten years or so later, it was the hardest time when the decision came to put him down to end his pain from an attack. Away from home and as my sister was at work, it was my mom who stood by his side as he passed. I imagine just like Hachi, Jett has images of happier times and of my mother's face as he passed on. I can only hope that when it is my turn, he will be there waiting for me."
"The moment you start watching the puppy Hachi in the first scene of the movie being shifted from one country to another, you just cannot stop adoring the little fella. He is the highlight of the movie and thats quite intentional as it is centered around him.As many would have read in the synopsis, Hachi is brought home by Parker(Richard Gere) when he comes home from his daily work routine and finds Hachi abandoned at the train station. As many people would try to find its owner, Parker sets to find the true owner(but fails) and starts advertising for adoption. The story that unfolds later may be slow and drab but it is well told and the chemistry between Parker and Hachi is truly commendable and engaging. Small yet cute details such as showing Hachi's vision in the form of black and white are worth a mention. The characters in this movie are few but manage to deliver decent performances such as the hot dog guy, Parker's wife and friend. Without revealing much about the movie, let me point out that its Richard Gere and Hachi who steal the show. Throughout the movie you feel that two are meant to be together forever to the point you doubt sometimes that whether Parker has a daughter and a wife living in his house. Nonetheless, he loves them too.One of the most important talked about point about the movie is its ability to touch everybody's heart and make the audience and viewers shed a few tears for the second half of the movie. This is something I totally agree and this movie is one such rare gem that made me cry the most. Its just so sad in some scenes. I bet all pet lovers would love this movie and appreciate it as a highly engaging and emotional movie. This is certainly one of my favorite movies and since I am not a pet owner yet, am planning to buy an Akita dog and name it 'Hachi' for he is the hero just as the kid mentions."
i will only say this that i m writing these words while tears in my eyes.i also an animal lover.i saw many sad movies but none can compare to this.can bring tears to any guy who watch this..so i must say that weak guys don't watch this..this may effect your emotions and u can go in depress.i got depress till 2-3 days after saw this movie.now i want to watch this movie again but don't have guts to watch this again maybe i m not that strong.but must watch movie.i love that breed of dog in movie. i will tell to all my friends and others that go and watch this movie.i sure u will never forget this movie in your whole life.100% real and simple story.hats off to director..(Namaste)
"I have just had the privilege to watch one of the most touching movies i have seen in many a year.In this age of cgi special effects,and explosions and violence.It was great just to watch a simple movie.A movie about the wonderful relationship between a master and his dog.Of loyalty and friendship. This movie brought me to tears and i am not ashamed of it to admit it.Richard Gere was good in his role,but the dog Hachi,was just absolutely magnificent.The bond between the two,you could see from the start.It is truly a great family movie and make sure,you have the tissues ready because you will need it. A truly great movie.Get it out on DVD."
"I find myself giving this film a lower vote than it probably deserves and perhaps through no fault of the film itself. Let me explain. I am lucky enough that in my job I get to take people who I work with to the cinema. After planning on seeing a gangster flick, we ended up going into the wrong screen and ended up watching Hachi: A dogs story. We did not move to the right screen as by my watch the film had started 10 minutes before. The point is, from the start of the film when the 'U' classification came up (Suitable for 4 years +) I was a bit disappointed. Now as an actor I like Richard Gere but for the first few minutes I found his character a bit 'wooden'. At first I put this down to him having a bad film, but the more I think about it I think it was somehow done to emphasise his relationship with Hachi. Anyway, half an hour into the film disillusionment had gone and I was really enjoying the film. What was excellent for me, was that because I had never heard of the film, I had no idea what was to come. The film does an excellent job of surrounding itself around Hachi the dog. The only fancy gimmick is the occasional sight through Hachi's eyes which is done in black and white but this is only occasional. There are no doggy voices or doggy thoughts, but you still get involved with Hachi's emotions and how he is feeling. Towards the end of the film I was that into Hachi's character that I found myself bursting into tears, something that had not happened to me since I was 8years old watching ET. Luckily, we were the only ones in the cinema."
i started to watch the movie with a great expectation...and i can assure you that i got more than that....it brings tears every time i think about the movie...well its not a review for that movie at all...i am writing it from my heart....after watching Hachi...i got a feeling...loyalty is just a word in front of love...if there is actual love in somewhere in our heart...loyalty is like a drop of water in front of a entire ocean....so whatever Hachi feels...its more than loyalty....and its true 'the professor' didn't choose Hachi...Hachi choose him.....i love that move...and i like to cry for it every time....anyway i want to talk something about the movie casting..Richard Gere was awesome.but Hachi himself was incredible..i was speechless..may be everyone..
"Lasse Hallstr√∂m's latest is based on a true story ‚Äì transplanted from 1930s Japan to contemporary New England ‚Äì about a faithful Akita dog called Hachi. Hallstr√∂m's unfussy, effective film uses several visual techniques ‚Äì dog's eye-view black-and-white footage, sped-up time frames ‚Äì to tell the often moving tale of Parker Wilson (Richard Gere), a music professor and family man who surrenders to the charms of dog ownership. When Parker dies and his family sells up and moves away, Hachi legs it back to the railway station where his owner used to arrive home from work and keeps vigil there for almost a decade. Sensitively directed and rarely over-sentimental, this touching parable will likely ravish the emotions of dog lovers. Yet the film is as much about the emotional fallout of death as about a mutt's loyalty and devotion. As a dog owner, I must confess to having had a large lump in the throat throughout. So call me soppy."
"I have to say this is the saddest film I have ever watched! I got half way through this film and wondered if I should continue as I was already welling-up! It is an amazing film and so well written and acted by all the cast, more by the dog! Oh it has left me so sad! Richard Gere is not one of my favourite actors but he shone in this and really showed how a dog and it's owner can have such loyalty between one another! I watched it ion my own, as my partner is not one for this genre, although after persevering with him and and telling him how high it scored on IMDb he has agreed to watch it! I have just bought this film!"
"First of all you know the real-life story behind it, Hachiko: A Dog's Story (2009). The film starts to swallow you. After 15 minutes you are one of the extras in the film. you wanna touch the screen, hug hachi. what if you ever had a dog. here is my word. you will cry. A must-watch film, for all animal lovers. such kind of movies ties people to life. What makes this so touching. I just say ""Friendship without expectations"" that what we all miss.Also during the movie we don't see dramatized,agitation. pure story, good acting. After watching this film you will suggest this to many people around."
"Hachi: A Dog's Tale is the story about Parker Wilson, played by Richard Gere, and the bond he forms with a Japanese Akita puppy, which is later found to be named Hachiko, he finds at the train station. Following is the chance relationship that develops between the 2 and how the soon become inseparable. Soon, Hachiko is noted by the inhabitants of the small Rhode Island town for showing up each day to meet Parker as he comes home from work. The Akita breed is most known for the loyalty they forge with their companions, whose loyalty is tested for nearly a decade after tragedy befalls Parker.At times, the point of view is taken so that we feel we are Hachiko, which allows us to see the curiosity, intrigue, and sometimes inquisitive thoughts he feels. One such event is when Parker attempts to get Hachi to play fetch, as he looks back at Parker curious of what is wrong with him. In other instances, when it comes to the onlookers, the angle is set such that we are looking up to Hachi. This leads into the end result of the bond formed between the 2, and that such love and loyalty is an admirable trait. After many viewings of the movie, it still manages to pull out the same feelings. The relationship between Parker and Hachi is believable, memorable and shows us what a true bond is really about. Some of you may have seen Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey, or are at least familiar with movies relating to the bond between man and his companions, of the four-legged kind. These types of films show the viewers that whether from the view of the man or the animal, a deep bond means just as much to both.The story reached so deep, that I dreamt of seeing the statue dedicated Hachiko, whose loyalty to his master lasted until his last breath. Luckily, I had the privilege when I passed through Shibuya. Hachiko truly made impression on those around him, as this film will do when you watch it."
"You choose to watch a movie such as this knowing darn well that it's going to turn out to be a tearjerker. You set yourself and steel yourself against it. There will be no tears, you insist to yourself. It's just a movie - even if it is based on a true story in Japan almost 80 years ago. But it's still just a movie. No tears. But in the end you have to succumb. This is literally an emotional roller coaster, with ups and downs from beginning to end. I've not always been really impressed with director Lasse Hallstrom's work, but he truly managed one of the finest and best told tearjerkers I've ever come across with ""Hachi.""The movie features a good performance from Richard Gere as Parker, the man who adopts (somewhat unwillingly and definitely against his wife's wishes) an Akita puppy who found him (for the point of the story is definitely that Hachi found him) and we follow the development of a bond of loyalty and even friendship between the two that transcends even death. Gere was good, but it wasn't an incredibly demanding performance, because the dog is the star. He waits anxiously day after day at the train station for Parker to come home from work, and Parker looks forward to the greeting. Then, unexpectedly, Parker dies, but Hachi never gives up, going back day after day to the station for the next ten years, waiting without hope for Parker to come off the train, all leading up, of course, to the ultimate tearjerker moment - both sad and happy - as Hachi finally dies lying outside the station one night, but in death sees Parker come out of the terminal and runs to him as they're joyfully reunited. A man and his dog reunited. If you're not shedding tears by the end of this - seriously, what's wrong with you?This is basically a much more serious version of the ""Marley & Me"" type of storyline. Where that movie focused on the clumsy lovability of the dog, this one focuses on the undying bond of loyalty the dog shares with its master. This is truly one of the most emotionally wrenching movies (both happy and sad) you will ever come across. (9/10)"
"Hachi: A Dogs Tale is a masterpiece and a classic. It will move you to tears, and make you laugh. It will even exite you - yes, despite what you might think, there actually are moments of genuine suspense in this movie! It's by no means a thriller, but it still manages to get your heart pumping! I almost jumped out of my seat during the scene in the garage! People need to see this movie, movies like this just don't come around often. In some ways, it even changed my own life for the better. When thinking about Hachi, I always strive to be better than I am, to never give up, and to always believe that anything is possible. This might be the most important movie you will ever watch! It really has everything, an exiting, thrilling and heartbreaking story, lovealbe and relatable characters that are incredibly portrayed by Richard Gere and Joan Allen. This is without a doubt Richard Gere at his absolute best. The fact that he never won the Oscar for this is an outrage. It should be studied (and probably is) in acting schools everywhere because what they have managed to achieve here is nothing short of magical! Every scene, every cut is brilliantly concieved, there are nothing in this movie that is filler or unnecessary. You sit on your toes and are constantly floored by just how magnificent this movie really is. It will entertain you while at the same time cause you stop and think about what's really important in life. I will cause you to question your very own existence, to think about what is possible, what a dog is capable of and what really makes us all human. WOW! This film is history. It stands alone. It raises the bar for how movies as a medium should be viewed in our society. See this movie now, and then see it again a thousand times. Then watch it again."
"I'm glad to see there are reviews here that don't just eat this story up with a spoon. It has the potential to be an amazing, inspiring film, but it falls way short on all fronts. As one blogger said, ""it tries to impart an Asian sensibility of 'animal as individual' that doesn't work in a contemporary American setting.""If the filmmaker/screenwriter is going to take the fact-based story (and who really knows how much of that is true) as the bones of a contemporary film set in a completely different country, then he needs to elevate all aspects of the story to match. There are plenty of reviews here that illustrate the major flaws in screen writing, characterization, and the like. But how could the movie have reached the level of that inspirational, life-changing synopsis it claims to be? First of all, there is no rule that the wife can't attach to the dog and love it, and still have the animal's primary loyalty be toward the husband. Many animals bond much more with one family member. Creating a character who comes across as not caring for the animal her husband so loves, leaves the viewer wondering what he saw in her in the first place. It's contradictory to love.If the animal really ""inspires a whole town"" as the synopsis claims, why doesn't a whole town come together and take care of him instead of patting him on the head, saying a brief hello, and throwing a scrap of food? When the dog refuses to stay at the daughter's house and travels miles back to the train station, it's reprehensible that she opens the gate and lets him again find his way back over dangerous (and being an animal on the streets is always dangerous) territory. Why not have her take him back and work out something with the people there (train master, vendors, local store owners) that allows him to live at the station as he so desperately needs to do. She never checks on him again, which leaves the viewer cold and wondering how she sleeps at night.Her son (who starts and ends the story about Hachi his hero) is growing up the whole time the dog is waiting at the station, yet she never takes the child to meet the dog. What a lesson and inspiration it would have been to visit him and bring food and bedding on a regular basis in order to ensure the dog's comfort and safety. Teaching the child that sacrificing for those we love, including our four-legged family members, is part of the experience of life would have enriched this film in so many ways. Instead, the boy, at the end of the movie, says this all happened ""a long time ago,"" as if it were decades before his birth. No one in the family ever seems to check in or make sure Hachi is okay, and the wife only stumbles across the dog, and is surprised to see him, when visiting her husband's grave on the ten year anniversary of his death. The dog sleeps under an old train in freezing conditions, and no one seems to care. The scene where the family is looking at old pictures of Parker with Hachi is heart wrenching and dumbfounding. What did they tell the child: ""Oh, yeah, the dog wanted to wait for Grandpa so we let him run free and fend for himself on the streets. Not sure if he's still alive or not.""Had the town come together to watch over this loved animal and offer him solace and physical and emotional comfort in his grief as a tribute to the man they all have so much respect for, it would have made this the inspirational, uplifting film it has the potential (and right) to be. It never does that.This is not a film any child should see and one most adults (and animal lovers) should avoid. It breaks the viewer's heart--for all the wrong reasons."
"I had good expectations from this movie having seen it rated high on IMDb. I also knew that it was basically a dog's tale. From the opening scene where a boy proclaims Hachiko as his hero, I already had a plot in mind of some incredible deeds from the dog. But boy! Was I caught offguard! This very very simple tale just blows your mind. The single mindedness of devotion, love and loyalty is enough to leave you embarrassed, mentally and emotionally. There is no way you can stack up to this guy. I have seen some supposedly sad movies, but this one without any apparent sadness or serious moment still brings tears to your eyes. An incredible feat by any standards. A must watch."
"I still can't stop thinking about it, so that says something. However, I'm really troubled by the behavior of the characters in this movie. Ultimately, the storyline doesn't work in the 21st century.I was troubled that Parker let his dog roam the streets and follow him without even a collar on. And the wife, whose name I can't even remember, doesn't seem to ever attach to the dog for no valid reason as the dog is adorable and loving. The fact that the poor animal is forced to sleep in the tool shed when these people have a huge house with a wonderful sun porch for just the two of them is more than annoying. In fact, the dog is NEVER shown in the house as a grown animal. Makes me think his loyalty is misplaced and nowhere near deserved by these people. Even after her husband dies, she never even says goodbye as her daughter loads the dog up. There is no explanation given as to why she doesn't keep the dog as any creature loved so much by a beloved husband should be cherished and taken care of. The daughter makes a half-hearted attempt to keep the dog, but gives up quickly and never goes to see how the dog is doing. Oh, and how do they explain to the son that they just left grandpa's dog to fend for himself? Makes no sense.The one with the most concern is the Japanese professor who at least attempts to give money to the local vendors for the dog's care. They refuse as they're willing to take care of him, but there's no true care going on. Couldn't the station master give him a broom-closet to sleep in? A dish with some real dog food in it? A blanket or two? And the hot dog vendor only offers some stray scraps of leftover hot dogs. That's not nutrition. And in the true story, apparently the station master did allow the dog to live in the station and made a home for him (which would have worked MUCH better here) rather than allowing him to live under an old train in all kinds of weather. The ending does work well in its uplifting vision of dog meeting master upon his death.The filming is well done, and the black and white images of life through a dog's eyes are creative and just enough to make the point. The setting couldn't be more beautiful and adds to the haunting tone of the story.The screenplay is ultimately really flat to match the characters. The daughter makes an impassioned plea for the dog to stay, telling him how much they love him and want him, and in the next breath says goodbye and opens the gate. Okay, so the premise is the dog needs to do what the dog needs to do, but that's like saying a ten-year-old should be allowed to do what he or she feels like doing. It doesn't make sense. No one goes out of his or her way to help the dog in any meaningful way, not even in a superficial way. And when the wife shows up at the train station ten years later to visit her husband's grave, her interaction with the dog is trite.Maybe the film would have worked if set in the original time period (1920s) if not the original country. And after writing this I know why I can't stop thinking about it. I'm haunted by the loyalty of an animal who is ultimately so neglected and ignored.This film is a sad commentary on human behavior and the emotional, physical waste of this beautiful animal is, even to anyone who isn't a major animal lover, a horrible tragedy. There is no redemption in this film. Just sadness."
"Yes its true, Hatchi is the best movie of all time... I saw it with my whole family, they all cried... i saw it with my friends, they cried like hell too! from that day onwards, their attitude towards dogs and animals became far more empathetic and they started to see them in a different light.. It also helped us talk about real life loyalty and love and how that true friendship or bond is missing in the real world! Its truly a masterpiece and there is no one i know that has not shed a tear while watching this beautifully directed, written, and acted movie... kudos to the entire team, its a true movie experience!! I wish such movies were made time and again..."
"This is one of the best movie I've ever seen in my life, emotional and touching movie in generations.The Direction is so touching it made me cried, blown away.Richard Gere done an excellent work and gave the performance of his career and the work of the Dog is amazing even the aged look of the Dog its very touching, the camera work and screen writing is excellent.This movie is an emotional blast it will take you to the next level of crying and crying and trust me it's possible only if you animals.I recommend please see this movie once in your life. It's really 10 out of 10."
I got this movie through I-tunes and was watching it on my IPOD at work. Prior to that my girlfriend told me about this movie and that it was a complete tearjerker. So at the second half of the movie when Richard Gere died I felt my eyes started getting watery and when it came to the last part my eyes were flooding with tears and I tried so hard to hide it from my co-workers since I'm a huge well built guy crying out of nowhere. After watching the movie I immediately called my girlfriend to tell her that I've seen it and when I told her about the climatic part at the end I still couldn't help but cry again. A definite must see movie!
"i never thought that i will be giving 10 out of 10 to a movie, but this Richard gere starrer movie just took my breath away,i was watching this movie with my entire family and the end of movie everyone had to wash there faces and all the tissue papers were exhausted,powerful acting, ossom cinematography and what a dog!!! in my opinion he should be given a Oscar for his role . it might be very stupid of me if i start discussing the aspects of his character, but i don't care, he did full justice to his character, the dog portrayed his character which such innocence that was enough to bring tears in our eyes...........the climax is something that everyone should watch out for......it is the time when i assure you you will cry like a baby....... the music in the movie is very moving and goes with the theme. all in it is a movie which you can watch over and over again and wont regret crying.....proud to have seen this movie!!!!"
"I usually don't do a lot of reviews, but after I watched this movie, I just had to. I simply cannot describe how meaningfull and touching this movie is.If you only have a little heart in your body, this movie WILL make you to tears. I haven't shed a tear in at least 4 years. I never feel emotional after watching a movie, but this movie just broke all records.It is such a beautiful movie, yet so simple, and still absolutely not boring. This movie shows the real loyalty of dogs, and how they actually see things in life.No matter how big, smart, talented or harsh you are, this movie will bring you to tears in your eyes. guaranteed. and it is worth it.I wonder why there's still so many people that do not know about this movie. It should be spread out.10/10 all the way. It was worth it every single second."
"This movie really made me cry for quite a long time. I somehow believed that the greatest love of all is not expressed by humans. Hachi waited for his deceased master for more or less 9 years and never gave up even though professor Wilson was dead. How many people do you think can wait forever for someone special to them? I admit I'm incapable of doing that.The story of how Hachi found Mr. Wilson may be unrealistic to some people since as if destiny brought them together, I wouldn't say anything negative about it or any of the flaws(if there is any) that critics may notice in this film. The way the master and his dog were finally reunited in heaven really warms even the coldest of hearts. In closing; to all the people reading this review, ""Never forget those who you love so dearly; because they will never forget you""."
"If you have ever truly loved a dog and that dog loved you this movie will bring you to tears. For about the last third of the movie I began to well up with tears and then after the time lapse, I could not stop crying.After the movie I was full of sad emotions about the dogs in my past I loved. This movie really connects the viewer with the loyalty and love of a great dog. Anyone who does not like this movie has clearly never loved a dog like a sibling or child.I felt Richard Gere played his role perfectly and was portrayed as a man who has a genuine heart for animals, which works even better to heap the emotion on the viewer."
"My Akita was exactly like Hachi. She was so bonded to me, I couldn't bear to think of what my dying would have done to her. She would go to the window ten minutes before I got home; it didn't matter that there was no pattern to my schedule, somehow she 'knew'. Once I had to go away for a few months; I heard how sad she was, so I phoned and I sent home a shirt I'd worn, so she would know I was alive.She was the smartest dog I ever met. But she would never learn to fetch (sometimes she went to get it, but only if she wanted it, she almost never would bring it back), it seemed to me that she had too much dignity.I did always did everything I could to make hers the best life any dog ever lived; I knew how loyal she was, and returned every bit of it to her.That was 15 years ago. After the first few minutes of the movie ""Hachi"", I never stopped crying until the end. I loved the movie, the most moving one I ever saw. Beautifully made and unforgettable."
"What goes on inside the head of dogs when they are waiting for their master? Why do they do it, time after time, why do they show so much joy every time their life companion shows up? Don't they get tired of us? I know we do, so why don't they?This is a film about a dog so loyal that he waits every day his master's return, even if the man died ten years ago. The story is a true story, only it happened in Japan in the 20's. The movie was really well done, with as much an emphasis on the dog as possible. People except his master were just secondary characters, a thing that further underlined the dog's single minded obsession and love.Rationally, if you think about it, any man doing what this dog did would be institutionalized as an obsessive compulsive. Would we respect the man in any way? And still, such a simple show of loyalty brought tears to my eyes that I could not stop from coming out. I knew I was inventing human traits for the dog, but it still would not make me feel any less miserable for that animal's sense of loss. I am also making an effort to not turn this review into a ""stop killing dogs, you brainless simpletons!"" so I stop here.Bottom line: Very simple story, very effective movie, the actors were a little out of it, except Richard Gere who did great. It will evoke more feeling in you than a thousand romantic comedies, even of those that are not a joke."
"A movie about a dog and his relationship with his owner(s). Didn't we have something similar with Marley? Not quite! Where Marley struggled to keep up and keep you invested to the characters and/or the dog(s), this one hits all the right buttons. From beginning to end it grabs you and takes you on an emotional roller-coaster. You must be of stone, if this story leaves you completely cold (or you just don't care about animals or didn't like the movie) ...And although quite a few people seem to get the story wrong (saying something about the dog, that's not true that is), even if you knew where this was going, it still is very emotional. It's about friendship and loyalty. It's about respect and decency. And all this portrayed mostly without words.It is very nicely shot and the music score is good too. Based on something that really happened, this is a story that you should watch. And you don't have to be ashamed if a tear or two roll down your cheek ..."
"Hachiko wasn't a film i was expecting to see, due to the fact that here in Mexico the translation to Spanish sucked and the marketing did as well. But my brother had to see it for school, and i wasn't going to deny going to a dog's film. I love dogs, and i loved Marley and me with its drama, so i was expecting something like that. What did i get?? besides my unstoppable sobbing throughout the film and the fact that my red eyes hurt a lot later, i loved this film. This is the definition of an EMOTIONAL film. Richard Gere does it great here (better than in pretty woman, in my OP) with bonding Hachi, who was beautiful as a puppy, as the regular hachi, and even as the old one. He was extremely beautiful and i love beautiful and tender dogs. So even in the happy parts i started to shed a happy tear, but from the moment... (well, you know what moment) i couldn't stop crying throughout the film. I actually consider myself a sensitive guy, but i never cry OUT LOUD in the cinema. I tried to hold it, but just couldn't. This has to be one of the two films in which i have cried the most in my whole life, and that's a good thing. I actually love the emotional moments in every film. The story is greatly portrayed, and the relationship couldn't be better. God, when hachi dreams of him i just couldn't stop sobbing. Poor hachi, really. And of course what got me is the friendship and loyalty scent that this movie doesn't lack at all. I definitely will buy it, cause i love dogs and i love emotional films. And this film exceeded both things. I recommend it, even though it's inevitable you are gonna cry"
"For the first time, in a movie based on an animal, have I actually related to the feelings of the animal. This may sound very strange but it's true. The way the dog waited for his master every single day at the same time until he died is just heart breaking. All that hope of seeing his master was in vain until Hachiko was brought together with him after death, which is what I wanted to believe just to diminish the sadness I felt.It was so hurtful in the end that I felt like crying like a baby. After reading a few posts here for the movie, I found one thing common in all and that is how much everyone cried. It really is a tear jerker but a must see. I wouldn't just recommend people with pet dogs to watch it, but also people like me without pets. And not to mention, Hachi was a beautiful dog you are guaranteed to fall in love with him the moment he comes on screen as a little puppy. Over all, it was a simple film with all the lime light on Richard Gere and his dog and the rest, just background actors."
"There are some films that deserve a five star review for reasons other that artistic success on every level; HACHI; A DOG'S TALE is one of those, for despite some minor technical problems with the film (the sound editing seems absent as the music - a fine score by Jan A.P. Kaczmarek - too frequently covers the conversation, the slipping in color between black and white and color seems accidental rather than intentional, etc), this little film is a heart warmer, a film that makes us glow with a story about the love between dog and man that transcends so many naturally occurring barriers. Originally released as HACHIKO MONOGATARI in Japan where the true story took place in the 1920s, the screenplay and story were written by both Kaneto Shind√¥ and Stephen P. Lindsey and the well-chosen director is the sensitive Lasse Hallstr√∂m. The story really belongs to Hachi, a Japanese Akita who is befriended by a professor (Richard Gere) when left stranded at a train station (the film is transferred to an eastern American locale). The stationmaster (Jason Alexander) encourages the professor to take the dog home, much to the surprised annoyance of the professor's wife (Joan Allen). But the professor and Hachi bond, encouraged by the couple's daughter (Sarah Roemer), and Hachi follows the professor to the train each morning and waits for his return each night. Though a tragedy occurs, the strength of this dog/man bond is so strong that nothing can break it- not even prolonged separation. Hachi becomes part of the train station family and grows in respect when the ultimate test of his endurance occurs. And that is quite simply the story. There are some very beautiful little cameos by Cary- Hiroyuki Tagawa, Erik Avari, Davenia McFadden, and Robbie Sublet, but the true feeling of this film is that of an ensemble effort lead so very competently by Richard Gere's portrayal. It is a little film to treasure. Grady Harp"
"I like dogs, but I also appreciate good film making. Without spoiling I am safe to say, the best thing about this movie was the end. There is something wrong with a movie, if the last scene is emotionally most touching and it contains text. Text about the real events that are portrayed in the film (another example would be ""Black Hawk Down"")Everything before was mildly interesting. I was surprised to find out Lasse Hallstr√∂m directed this, who is most famous for ""Chocolat"" and ""The Cider House Rules"". I must say I am not a big fan of his work, I thought some kind of indie, amateur or semi professional cinematographer filmed this. Hachi was released in 2009, why does it looks 15 years older? The film must have been on low budget? The camera equipment seams poor and everything including the soundtrack feels cheap. Containing the same monotonic piano strumming throughout the whole movie. Sometimes Hachi would have been better without, especially towards the end. you hear more or less the same tune in every scene, and it gets repetitive.The story is based on a true and mildly interesting story, unfortunately the storytelling has some major flaws. You don't get to know much about the characters, they are only sketches. But let's start with the beginning: a Japanese monk decides to send a dog puppet to the United States of America. Obviously lots of Japanese monks to that. The movie explanation is rather stupid: it must have been fate. Hachi and Gere meet each other at the train station. The story: Gere's grandson is telling the story of Hachi in his school as his ""personal hero"". Later on we find out, that his own family didn't care about Hachi at all. After Gere's character dies and things don't work out well with the family dog Hachi, they put him outside the house and the dog runs away, out of frustration. The family should perfectly know where he is. After all he went to the train station everyday to meet with his owner. Everyone in town knows where Hachi is, and it was even in the news. Still they never look after him. Couldn't they at least bring him some food. They don't seem to care. Remember the first scene? Hachi is supposedly some kind of ""hero"" for the family. Another point is, Hachi decides to abandon his supposedly caring and loving family and he is suffering. No dog would do that, not to a certain degree. Not under that weather conditions, not when it is freezing cold and there is no food, not if he still has a home place and people that would provide for him. Why didn't he return to sleep or eat, rather be miserabe? After several years Hachi is found at the train station by Gere's widow. Didn't she knew from her daughter or the news or friends? Is she surprised that the dog is still alive? In the next scene the family is sitting all together inside of their cozy house again. But not with Hachi. They look at family albums with pictures of Hachi, but the the dog is still outside. How cynical is that? The dog is still out there, dieing in the cold, alone, why don't you take him home you heartless bastards, you monsters. Last scene Hachi dies. Like another reviewer wrote: Hachi is nothing more than a 90 minute soppy TV commercial with doggy in the rain and family albums, Christmas, couples, happiness and heaven, and not much else. It is not a bad movie though compared to other ""dog movies"", it shows the loyalty of a dog and that he always waits for you when you come home, to be fair, from all the dog movies I have seen so far, Hachi is still the best. 6/10"
"My wife and I just watched this film. I've been brought to tears through quite a few movies in 50 years, but I have to agree with my wife when she stated with the puffiest eyes I've ever sen on her, ""That was the saddest damn movie I've ever seen.""Why didn't we see this in a theater? I don't know, but I'm glad we did not get the opportunity. I could not contain myself through the last fifteen minutes of the movie. It's a film about love, compassion and loyalty.The synopsis of this film tells you what this film is about. These reviews you a reading tell you why you should see this film. If you are not afraid of sinking deeper into your emotions and exploding with tumultuous sorrow, rent this DVD. You won't be sorry.The last movie that moved me so was ""Remember Me"" because of the eventual nature of the story. This hit me with ten times the force."
"This film left me in a difficult place to review: it's a beautifully told and acted film that I wish I'd never seen. After three days, I'm still melancholy and teary. I would NOT recommend this film if you are very sensitive, nor is it a film for children. I'm a dog owner who is passionate about all dogs-- and the underlying themes of abandonment, confusion and sorrow Hachi endured completely tore me apart.The film is an exquisitely moving story about the ""real"" Hachi (Tokyo, 1923-34.) I avoid cute tear-jerker films, but this is different. You'll see remarkable scenes of Hachi's face and the joyous bond he felt for his master. But be prepared for tough scenes of a collarless Hachi sleeping under trains in the snow and wandering alone in old age. Only searching out details of the ""real"" Hachi helped me move past the film: though Hachi faced difficulties on the street, he did have shelter and was cared for. After running away from several new homes, a train station manager gave him a storeroom to sleep, and Hachi had access to homes of shop owners nearby. Hachi still kept his schedule of waiting daily for his master to return on the train, but his basic needs were cared for as best as people did in the 1930's. He lived to be embraced by many who came to feed him and pat his head for good luck, even attended the ceremony for his own statue being installed. Some accounts even say Hachi saw his master's body at the wake, and sat faithfully near him all night. Stories are exaggerated after 80 years, but I hope it's true, as I've heard this helps dogs understand and ease their grief.If you can handle it, watch this film for an memorable interpretation of Hachi's story. If you have a hard time shaking things off, you'll be better off reading about Hachi's noble soul-- and the enduring devotion he felt for his master, far beyond death."
"It was extremely hard for me to hold my tears. I had to keep reminding myself its a movie, but then a thought of this being a TRUE story kept taking the earlier thought over. This movie will shake you from inside out... wanna know the true meaning of love, loyalty & affection? Watch this... learn from a dog.This movie is based on a true story and will leave you in tears. This is a true tribute to a dog's loyalty and faithfulness to a man. Dog is not just a man's friend, its way way more than that and this movie does an excellent job putting that on the screen. A must watch movie. You will want to go out there and get a dog after seeing this one."
"You may be a dog lover (I am), you may love the real story of a real Tokyo Hachiko, but that doesn't excuse 8.0 average vote for a crappy film, a tearjerker that doesn't even succeed in that, a formulaic and just blah movie. Despite all the heartbreak of the story itself and the beautiful dogs that ""played"" all the right parts well, this bubble gum of a movie failed on so many levels, it lost even the ability to tear-jerk. Richard Gere mentioning ""the heart"" right before the...moment? All the ""see you tonight""'s before he leaves? Please! (just one example)Maybe the Japanese original film, Hachiko Monogatari (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hachik%C5%8D_Monogatari) is better, if it can be found anywhere."
"I came to know of the Hachiko story from one of the film screenings during the Japanese Film Festival more than two years ago, and having visited Tokyo, who would not have heard and noticed that one of the exits of the busy Shibuya station had one exit named after the famous dog? Why an American version of the story would be made baffles me, if not only to tell of yet another dog story following the likes of the Lassies and the Marleys that because dog is Man's best friend there will always be a ready market for it?Directed by Swede Lasse Hallstrom, at least there's the sensibility to still ensure that Hachiko remains Japanese, only for it to be accidentally transported from a Japanese monastery, and thanks to a botch up in cargo handling, Hachiko the puppy's destination ended up to be an American town with the Bedridge train station, where his first night wandering around the station's platform brought him to encounter Professor Parker Wilson, played by Richard Gere. Taking pity on the puppy whom he thought was abandoned, Parker brought it home to the opposition of his wife (Joan Allen), but who can deny a homeless dog especially one that looks as cute as a button?The gist of the story you would already know from the trailer which decided to tell all. The film curiously didn't spend too much time with Hachiko as a puppy, and decided to fast forward to when it became an adult dog, starting to walk with Parker to the station, and at 5pm every work day, promptly made its way back to the station to wait for its master, and then walking back. The Japanese version did this very well with people interaction along the way, which this version decided to erroneously gloss over. It's not about just the Professor and his dog, but the community around in which the dog's loyalty, faithfulness and street- smartness touched. Sure there was some attempts at that in this version, but there was too little and probably wanted to approach the story in a different direction.Unfortunately it got a little carried away, and after the pivotal turning point, it somehow went downhill with the narrative being dragged out because here's exactly when the relationship between community and the dog would have taken over to move this to another emotional plane, and didn't because the foundations were not established, granted though there were enough moments and scenes to tug at your heartstrings.One cannot deny that the Akita breeds are cute, and many would have missed the disclaimer toward the end of the credits that the dogs are for experienced dog owners, so don't you be heading toward the pet store to get one puppy on a whim, as the worst thing that shouldn't happen, is an abandonment because fancy has worn off, and would have been very contradictory to the message preached in the film.Between the American update and the original Japanese film, no prizes for guessing that I much prefer the latter for the simple reason that it had more genuine emotions with a better focus on Hachiko, and the locale which the American ""Hallmark"" version just tries so hard to replicate. Good news is the Japanese film made in 1987 is now re-released locally on DVD and is available in the shops now, and hopefully, the homage paid to the original story and the dog at the end of the film would pique interest in more picking up that version to watch."
"So many people think that this is such an amazing movie. I, however, do not. What I see is horrible cruelty for the dog. I know that many are using the fact that the dog keeps going back to the train station for years as a sign of loyalty (an it is a sign of loyalty), but him going back for all those years is also the cruel part.I have had dogs, cats, a rabbit and ferrets. All of them have been extremely attached to me and several did not even like it even if I was just outside the house and they could see me from the window. For years I have had a part in my will that states that if I die, my ""babies"" are to be shown my body so that they know that I will not be coming back. I do not want them to be waiting forever for my return that will never happen.I was crying throughout the last part of the movie, not that Parker Wilson (Richard Gere) had died, but that the poor dog did not know that and was now forever waiting for him to return. I had heard of a similar situation when a guy that had a dog with him in a hospital and had to have surgery, died in surgery and he too, waited for the rest of his life for his friend to return. I even make sure that any of my ""babies"" that are still alive see any of my ""babies"" that die, so that they are not waiting for them to return.I had seen a few reviews that had stated that you needed tissues, but I did not realize why. Had I known, I may not have watched this movie.I implore any of you that have an animal (or as I call mine, ""baby""), that is very attached to you as this dog was to Parker Wilson, that you make sure that the members of your family know that the animal, or your ""baby"" is shown that you are dead so that they do not wait for the rest of their lives for your return. It is a very cruel thing to not allow them to see that you are not coming back. Believe me, when they see that you are dead, they will understand that you will not be coming back."
"Having an Akita my self and knowing this story, I found this film so so very moving. I cried my heart out for long after the film had finished. it so much more than a ""mans best friend film"" its a film about a really bond that outlasts humans. Its such a beautiful moving, and wonderful film.the best I've seen in such a long time. love it! I've told many people about this film already and they all want to see it, and I've warned them all.... you may think your tough when it comes to films, but be warned you'll need tissues. any one thats had a dog/has a dog or any pet really will feel this film get slowly stuck in their throat. Richard gear plays the part so well and its just an all round winner. I can only wish my Akita is as loyal and as loving as Hachi. I think we may even see a wave of little puppies names after him now!"
"Waw, it is worth watch anytime of the day. I mean literally anytime. I was bored and then I remember I had to watch this movie. And now after watching it I am speechless!!! Please watch it, I recommend 1000000% that you won't regret watching it. It also comes with a great lesson that we all could learn after watching it till final!! I can't say much because you have to see it first and then you will understand why I wrote all this, but again I say it is a really worth watching movie :) just be careful where you watch it, I can not say much more! I love this movie so much that I even start to think who could possibly make a movie like this, I just love watching movie but this movie was the best ever, I can swear. I wish I could of publish this movie to the whole world, so everybody on the earth will watch it and make sure that nobody goes of comes into the world without watching this movie. I give it a 1000000000000 stars, much more if it was possible!!"
"Its a heart touching movie.. The screenplay,direction,photography,background music all are best. The Hachi is an amazing dog. We forgetting this is a movie.You absolutely involving.And your eyes should be wet. Especially the last meeting of Hachi and Allen.I just wondering how could act that dog like this???? Background music ,camera angles, location all are excellent. I never forget this movie.Everybody should watch this movie.You will get something, yes..Hatchi will come with you. In your heart.I can't believe there was a dog waiting for his master for 9 yrs.... I love this movie"
