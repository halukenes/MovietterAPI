"Bacheha-Ye aseman (Children of Heaven)It was with some trepidation that I popped this DVD into the player - it was, after all, my first venture into Iranian cinema, so I was a little unsure what to expect. I am used to, and for the most part, enjoy foreign films. They open up an incredible world of cinema that one would otherwise miss. After five minutes, it was fairly evident that this film was something a bit special. The story is simple. While at market shopping, Ali loses his sisters school shoes. After desperately trying in vain to find them, he decides that he and his sister will share his sneakers, meeting her after to school each day to recover them from her, in order to get to school himself. That is pretty much a synopsis of the entire movie. It doesn't end there however...This film is played with such beauty and innocence; it is a true pleasure to watch. Mohammad Amir Naji plays Ali with such incredible depth and passion, one is completely drawn into his plight. From the start of the film, we see the relationship between brother and sister, played with equal warmth by Bahare Seddiqi, strained as he explains how he lost her shoes. The sorrow on Ali's face, and Zahra's tears at the news, are truly heartbreaking to watch. The expressions on the faces of the children are so genuine, it is clear that spending a cinematic hour and half will be a pleasure, albeit not an easy one.We see Ali and his Father looking for work as gardeners. From the outset it is clear that Ali's Father is strict, but it is also evident he loves his son dearly, and the simple exchange of smiles as they find their first job is heart-warming, and totally believable. Cycling through the city, it is very striking that there is a clear division between rich and poor. We are watching a boy, to afraid to tell his father of the loss of a pair of shoes, riding through streets with billboards advertising cell phones, into rural areas where houses with swimming pools, ornate architecture and luxury are rife.There is so much in Western civilisation that we take for granted. What to us are simple daily belongings to others is pure decadence. Aside from anything else, this film is a window into a world so many of us do not understand. Simple things bring Ali pleasure, blowing bubbles, swinging on swings with his new found friend, the smiles and laughter of the children is absorbing.Later in the film we see Ali enter a race in order to win a pair of brand new sneakers for his sister. To win them, he must come third. Again we see the division of wealth, as Ali races through the streets, the thoughts and images of his sister swirling in his head, and on screen, while at the same time, parents of other children film the race on camcorders, all the time Ali running, fighting for the shoes he needs so desperately.The film is directed perfectly, and the credit for this goes to Majid Majidi, whose films have won acclaim worldwide. There are no special effects, no luxurious settings. There are times when the film feels like a documentary in the direction, and that works in its favour.  This film would make an excellent introduction into the world of foreign cinema. Throughout the movie, the expressions and emotions displayed by the children speak far louder than any dialogue ever could.The film is not dialogue intensive, and one could easily watch the film, and understand the story, even without the aid of subtitles. This film was nominated for an Academy Award, and it not difficult to see why. Ignoring for a moment the subtitles and language barriers, since they are not overly crucial to the film, this is a story of true innocence, and tugs hard at the heartstrings, sometimes to breaking point. The portrayal of the children is gentle, warm and absolutely believable, and one cannot help but be drawn into this tale, as it gently unwinds. It is sometimes tough to watch the emotions played out, but ultimately, worth every second.Missing this film, particularly if simply put off by the fact it is foreign language, would a sad deprivation of the senses and the heart. It is not just a film, it is an experience, and one that is completely passionate, and totally unforgettable.I truly cannot recommend this highly enough. It is widely available on DVD or VHS - rent it, borrow it or buy it - you will be glad that you did!Reviewed by Ollie"
"The wonderful Iranian film ""Children of Heaven"" and its companion piece, ""The White Balloon"", remind one of those great Czechoslovakian films of the 1960's (""The Shop on Main Street,"" ""Loves of a Blonde,"" etc.) in that they achieve their artistry by providing keenly observed glimpses into the minutiae of everyday life. They also help to humanize a culture often regarded as alien and even incomprehensible to western eyes. Above all, this magnificent film reminds us that real drama comes not in the form of over-plotted special effects-laden extravaganzas, but from films that examine the universal simplicities of life as we all know it. When it is distilled through the eyes of a poet - this is when art is achieved.""Children of Heaven"" has its roots planted firmly in the neorealist tradition. Its simple story echoes not merely the earlier ""The White Balloon"" but the original Italian classic, ""The Bicycle Thief."" In this film, young Ali accidentally loses his sister's recently mended shoes; out of this tale of utmost simplicity, the filmmakers take us on a fascinating tour of life in a typical Iranian village and family. As Ali and his sister scheme to overcome this obstacle, the film touches on any number of universal themes: the close ties of siblings united in their common bond of avoiding often irrational parental anger; well meaning, loving parents overwhelmed with the trials of everyday life who are often compelled to act out in ways that seem cruel to the children who adore them; the petty viciousness with which children often strike out at each other, yet, at the same time, the often unexpected kindness and empathy with which they also treat one another. The film manages to keep the audience constantly engrossed in its action without once resorting to even a smidgen of incredibility or melodrama. Beautifully directed, with a superb soundtrack filled with heightened naturalistic noises, it is a film of many-splendored wonders, its lyricism caught in a glimpse of soap bubbles floating around a backyard produced by two children abandoned to their moment of incomprehensible youthful joy, its high drama found in a shoe racing down a city sewer with a desperate young girl in tow.The actors, children and adults alike, underplay their roles in so naturalistic a fashion that one does not even feel they are performing at all; the film, through them, becomes a magical fabric of life that draws the audience deep into its world.""Children of Heaven"" brilliantly demonstrates that works of art often arise from the observation of the most seemingly mundane concerns of daily life and reminds us that this provides far more drama than all the exploding spaceships, car chases and hyperkinetic melodrama that flood the screen in the guise of entertainment. It certainly shows just how phony, empty and bereft of life most American films are. Don't miss ""Children of Heaven""! It is a richly rewarding experience."
"This movie quietly puts to shame the majority of junk spewing out of Hollywood. A fat wad of cash thrown at big names and special effects cannot move the human soul like the innocence and sincerety displayed by Majidi's cast and direction. It's a shame that there are not more movies like this.The plot is simple, the actors sincere and the tone spot-on. This movie works because we're drawn into the world of Ali, his life and his surrounding. Kudos to Majidi's craftsmanship. Ali's plight, though simple (if not trivial to most of us), becomes his obsession because of his love and respect for his sister and his family. We would do well to be so moved! The climax of the movie is brilliant! Ali's grueling determination to win a race and get shoes for his sister results in an unwanted triumph! (Sorry - no spoilers here. You'll have to see the movie). I must be getting older, because I'm moved with emotions just describing the movie -- and it's been months since I've seen it!The redemption of Ali's resulting emotion and confusion will be lost on an innatentive viewer, so *PAY CLOSE ATTENTION* to the last 10 minutes of the movie.Beauty doesn't have to forcibly blow you away. This movie is simply beautiful, and it will blow you away."
"Wow, what can I say? Every bit of this film is so warm! It really looked at the world from a child's perspective. Every single scene is inundated with sweetness and the innocence of children. How they share one pair of shoes was amazing...and heartbreaking. How the little sister had no confidence in her brothers shoes was shown in such a warm and effective way. The ultimate despair Ali felt when he won was also so heartbreaking. Ali and his sister are both so cute and they can really act. This film can easily move one to tears. Do watch it!"
"I find it most difficult and awkward to make comment on films that I personally do not like. That is why I could talk for days about this wonderful Oscar Submission!Children Of Heaven is one of those rare films that not only I want to talk about, but everyone else who has seen it seems to be raving about. This tender and triumphant little jewel of a film had every head turning at the recent 1999 Nortel Palm Springs International Film Festival, January 7th-18th. After it's first showing at the festival, people were indeed talking!""Did you see that film from Iran?"" ""No, any good?"" ""Just wait, go see it, we'll talk later!""The Children Of Heaven follows the relationship between an impoverished brother and sister, Ali and Zahra, who are thrust into a difficult circumstance all revolving around a pair of sneakers. How they choose to solve their problem themselves, without telling their parents, is what makes the story so heart-warming and unique. What follows is a tender, moving tale of compassion, determination, and deep family love.Bravo writer/director Majid Majidi!"
"............................................................from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FL It's easy to understand why there are over 100 reviews of ""Children of Heaven"". Normally, that simple fact would have dissuaded me from adding a review of my own. But, as I'm sure others have felt, this film so overwhelmed me with joy, I feel obligated to share my feelings with all who would listen! After watching ""Children"", it occurred to me that I have, perhaps, never seen an Iranian film I didn't like. This film celebrates the essence and innocence of youth, with an unencumbered intensity, with such unpretentious panache, that any comparison to American films that make an effort along similar lines, regrettably, seem rather empty, almost laughable in comparison. The fierce sibling rivalry so familiar in the majority of American movies is replaced here by a warm, caring fraternal relationship based on love, consideration, self-sacrifice and mutual respect. These little Muslim children demonstrate the most exemplary of true Christian behavior in both word and deed. I hope that here, in America, this opinion can be stated clearly, in a review such as this one, without fear of provoking a mindless outpouring of reactionary negative clicks. I feel more than a tinge of remorse, even embarrassment, when I think of the millions of Iranians who see far too many American films where children are portrayed, more often than not, as selfish, wise-cracking, foul-mouthed, bullying, disrespectful, totally inconsiderate little brats. To make matters worse, this abhorrent behavior is too often viewed as copacetic, or worse, even exemplary, something that kids today often strive to imitate. Some have commented that ""Children"" seems incomplete or leaves them feeling somewhat bewildered or left them hanging in mid-air. All I can say to them is just reflect carefully for a moment on the value systems of the kids in the movie...maybe then you will be able to feel much more satisfied with this great cinematic experience.10*....ENJOY/DISFRUTELA!Any comments, questions or observations, in English or Español, are most welcome!.....KissEnglishPasto@Yahoo.com"
"Majid Majidi is a genius. He is a director and actor of great talent. This film presents a sweet story of a brother and sister, their bond and their unique solution to solving the problem of a pair of lost shoes. The child actors are adorable and utterly convincing and the production of the film is of such quality that you get lost in watching it. The story itself is humorous, at times, and inspiring. Though the premise may be simple, each scene is infused with such passion, beauty and emotion that the experience of viewing this film is anything but simple. To all who have yet to view the film, take note of the very last scene."
"What a marvelous thing film can be. It can touch us and open our hearts to a culture that is both different and familiar to ours. CHILDREN OF HEAVEN, a film by Iranian filmmaker, Majid Majidi, takes us into the world of a little boy and his sister, letting us feel the love and trust that they have in each other. The boy, through no fault of his own, loses his little sister's newly repaired school shoes the day before she needs them. It becomes their secret. They try sharing a pair of his sneakers -- the girl wearing them in the morning and he in the afternoon to school. The wonderful, innocent faces of the beautiful Iranian children and their code of honor, even in poverty, provides the bases for a very uplifting tale of children trying to overcome a crisis. The direction, cinematography, music are all outstanding -- but it is the children that you will fall in love with. Well worth picking up on DVD (though there are no ""Extras"" to speak of)."
"This translates to MUST-SEE! It's a credulous incredible storytelling of a young brother and sister in Tehran, and the adventurous saga around one very important pair of sneakers.The two young actors are amazing -- they play their guileless naïve sensitivity with such earnestness! Central character, Ali, the 9 year old brother, is Mir Farrokh Hashemian, who really carried the film with his legwork, and the younger sister Zahra is Bahareh Seddiqui, who contributed her restrained share of screen presence. The pair is so natural: those furrowed faces, anxious knitted brows -- the range of sad faces the two came up with! The bond between the brother and sister is so warm and joyful - in spite of misfortunes.The storyline is seemingly simple. Such story-weaving knack writer-director Majid Majidi has -- he can make chasing along a streaming gutter into an intense dramatic episode! The story has the texture likened to a Thomas Hardy novel (poverty setting, episode after episode, turn of events), yet such a relishingly simple delivery. He doesn't have to tell it all on the screen -- little nuances and observations suffice.It's heartening to see young children who are polite and respectful to their elders, responsible and caring in dealing with their everyday problems, and not give up -- such quiet fortitude in spite of disappointments, such tolerance of their circumstance yet still able to find joy in little things. We catch a smile here and there, e.g., when they enjoy the impromptu soap bubbles, or when he encouraged his sister by giving her small tokens.This is an absolute gem of a family (value) film. Children's emotions untapped, yet adults are not left out -- touches of  grown-up connections: the parents, the elderly couple next door, the shop-owners, all made this world very real.The camerawork, and the well-designed use of sound mixed with accompanying music (different tonal quality instruments were applied) complemented this cinematic experience. A poetic ending -- there's a serenity about it all.I hope ""Children of Heaven"" will win this year's 71st Academy Award Best Foreign Film Oscar -- it will receive its due exposure and more people will experience this gem.Along the lines of poverty and shoes, I thought of  the Italian 1978's ""The Tree of the Wooden Clogs"" by writer-director Ermanno Olmi. And, on a story with substance and good acting by an Iranian young boy, there's 1989's ""Bashu, The Little Stranger"", by writer-director Bahram Beizai. Both are movies to be appreciated."
"I just saw this film in South Korea at a church.  The film is spoken in Farsi, the subtitles were in Korean.  It didn't matter that I couldn't understand a single word, because the cinematography and the faces of the children, their parents and the other cast members did all the talking. A wonderful film that dispelled my notions of Tehran as a dark and forbidding place - actually it's quite beautiful!  We Americans have not seen Iran since 1979 and it is my hope that soon we can restore relations again.  I wouldn't mind visiting."
"Children of Heaven, which is Iran's selection for best foreign film at the Academy Awards, is a very good movie mainly because anyone in this world can relate to the topic of family and showing love to each other no matter the living circumstances. As an Iranian film, it is definitely played safe but a film with such an universal theme and elegantly told as here should really not be missed, especially by movie-lovers.Majid Majidi's film is about a young boy named Ali who accidentally lost his sister Zahra's shoes. But their family can ill afford to buy new shoes, Ali decides to share his shoes with his sister until he can get new ones for her and so he can avoid punishment.The acting is pretty good, and pretty heartfelt. There is no questioning the chemistry between Amir Farrokh Hashemian as Ali and Bahare Seddiqi as Zahra. Reza Naji who plays as their father is also good as the man who is trying to do all he can to provide food for his family.Overall, Children of Heaven is a simple film but it displays a strong message about the bond of family. There are some talented films from the Middle East and this is one of them. It's a strong film about courage and about doing what's right. My favorite scene is where the father and the son leave their poor slums as they head uptown to the rich neighborhoods. This film shows how American kids are vastly different than kids from these parts of the world.....and not exactly in a good way. This film is a little too simple for me, but there is no denying how powerful this film is. I rate this film 8/10."
"Majid Majidi's Children of Heaven breaks the mold of foreign films. Foreign films are usually thought to appeal to only a sophisticated and cultured audience, but Children of Heaven is best suited for all audiences. Forget that this film is set in a foreign land with an unfamiliar culture. Forget that the script is written in a language that you can't understand. These elements are only a small part of the story that will whisk you away and get you lost in the simplicity of the plot. Children of Heaven follows the story of Ali and Zahra and their conquest to find a lost pair of shoes. In an attempt to hide the lost shoes from their parents, the brother and sister duo decide to share one beat up pair of sneakers. This films gives an inside view of the life of a poor Iranian family and the innocence of young children. Children of Heaven opens your eyes to culture different from your own. A culture very much stereotyped because of its common appearance in American newsstands. Children of Heaven tells a story never broadcasted in the media. It can help to show the similarities and differences between American and Iranian culture. Our similarities are more than your local news lets on. We both share a class system which separates the rich from the poor. We both share the importance of family relationships and religion. We often forget that people all over the world endure our same trials and triumphs. Children of Heaven forces its audience to examine their own lives. As Americans we wonder how children with so little can be content? We wonder what it means to live simply. This film reminds us to be thankful and not value our material possessions. It also reminds us the importance of strong family relationships. Next time you contemplate viewing a foreign film think of all the benefits. Viewing foreign films exposes you to new and different cultures, languages, music and landscapes. It can contradict stereotypes and biases conjured up by news reports. You will become more respectful to those with values and morals that differ from your own. Foreign films encourage you to explore new places and create appreciations for the benefits that your own culture has to offer you. WARNING: Children of Heaven may cause a new outlook on life. You will leave this film a little happier and more appreciative. Now don't say I didn't warn you."
"Majid Majidi's Children of Heaven is such an extraordinary work of movie-making that it is in a realm of movies that are able to connect with anyone who remembers (or is amidst) their childhood, regardless of what country they come from. (Note: Films that have a universal appeal aren't necessarily better than films that only appeal to people from one or two countries, but making a film with a universal appeal is no easy task.) A boy named Ali (Amir Farrokh Hashemian) loses his sister Zahra's ((Bahare Seddiqi) running shoes; Zahra threatens to tell their father (Mohammad Amir Naji). Petrified at his father's temper, Ali promises his sister that he will get his sister some new shoes as soon as possible. In the meantime, the two work out a tight shoe-switching schedule. The plot is inventive and provides some decent chuckles-good writing and comic timing. Hashemian is likable and relatable though he milks the babyish whimpering to an annoying extent. Naji is able to give us a stronger feeling that we are watching a real person on screen than any of the other actors in the film. It is not until the last ten minutes of the film, however, that we are swept up in a crazy whirlwind of emotion, jolting from despair to joy to suspense (though not in that order) and the last ten minutes can make a movie great. Majidi gives us homage to The Four Hundred Blows. The ending to Majidi's movie is somewhat similar to that of Francois Truffaut's; both movies contain the feeling of extreme desperation, but Ali has a goal in his life while Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud) is boldly going nowhere. Truffaut's film concludes with brilliant ambiguity, leaving us wondering whether Doinel's last five minutes on screen were triumphant or pathetic; Majidi does something quite similar (less ambitiously) in a way I would not dream of revealing."
"One of my favorite movies is ""Children of Heaven,"" written and directed by Majid Majidi, an Iranian film from 1997.  The film industry in Iran is very different from the industry in America.  In this film, you will not find any special effects, marketing tactics, or expensive sets.  The movie is told in a very simple real fashion using camera work, acting, and real life streets and scenery, giving the film a realistic documentary feel.  This characteristic of Iranian film draws us in to the story and gives us the ability to relate closely with the children in a way American films does not.  The approach gives the film an honest character and believable reality. This subtitled film humanizes Iran for the American viewer.  You realize that people are people no mater where they live, all have the same feelings and emotions.    Ali The story is told through the children and their experiences.  Children of Heaven takes you into the hearts and lives of a young boy, Ali (played by Amir Farrokh Hashemian), and his sister, Zhara (played by Bahare Sediqi), capturing the life of a family living in poverty in Iran.  After watching this movie, seeing a story where a pair of lost shoes can be so important, you realize that we are very lucky to live in a time and country where most people never go without such basic items as shoes.  This film shows us a place where people may not have much, but they have what they need most of all, each other.  The family bond is strong, that can often be lost in the fast paced and transient society that America tends to be.  The father works hard but is basically unskilled.  He also has the burden of is caring for a sick wife and a baby as well.  The children have to help out in many ways, which further bonds the family.  The family lives in a small apartment with only one room. The movie begins as 9-year-old Ali goes out on errands, one of which is taking his sisters shoes to be repaired.  The shoes are very worn but are mended.  Afterwards he stops to buy some potatoes at the market, leaving the shoes and some other parcels at the front of the store.  While Ali is in the store a scrap collector comes along and takes the shoes along with the other bags he collects there.  When Ali comes out he finds the shoes missing. He frantically searches the fruit stand boxes, knocking down several in the process, and the storekeeper chases him away.  He has a difficult and tearful time telling his sister about the shoes being lost.  When Zhara realizes that they are truly gone, she wonders what she will wear to school. Ali knows that his family cannot afford to buy her shoes, and pleads with her to keep this a secret between then. Ali devises a plan and convinces Zhara to go along with it because their parents could not afford shoes at this time and it would only be a burden to tell them of the loss.  Ali talks Zhara into sharing his shoes, with Zhara wearing them to her school in the mornings and Ali the afternoons to his. Zhara is skeptical but agrees and suggests that they clean the dirty sneakers.  The kids find laughter in this experience as they play with soap bubbles and wash the shoes together.     When it rains that night, Zhara wakes Ali, who goes out in the rainstorm to move the shoes to a dry spot. We are hopeful that the plan will work out, but there is not enough time to make the switch without Ali being late to school each day.  Ali runs quickly to school and makes the best of the situation.  One social difference that you learn about in the film is the schooling where the boys and girls are in separate schools.  The schools are very regimented, teach discipline, and gender roles to the children.  The students do not speak to adults without raising their hands and waiting for permission. In once scene you see how the family interacts and the honesty that is taught in the home.  The father is working for the mosque breaking up a large piece of sugar into small lumps with a hand tool to be used for the tea at the prayer meeting.  As they prepare to have tea at home they realize that there is no sugar, but the father will not allow them to use even a small piece because the sugar does not belong to them, it belongs to the mosque.  This takes a lot of character when you are faced with doing without, and you have so much temptation right in front of you.  However, for them there is no question, you exercise self-control and honesty.In one scene, the gravity of the situation continues to build its emotional picture when Zhara loses one of the sneakers in the gutter on her way home from school.  She runs down the street, desperate to catch the shoe.  It was very distressful when she sat crying near where the shoe finally stopped, but remained out of reach in a covered section of the gutter.  Fortunately a compassionate storekeeper helps Zhara retrieve the shoe and returns it to Zhara.  She doesn't have much time to explain as Ali rushes to put on the shoes, one wet and one dry, and runs off to his own classes.Ali and Zhara are very touching as they support each other through the adventures with the sneakers.  There are several moments of humor as well, making this movie both sad and funny. Although Ali and Zhara are young they understand the gravity of the situation and the importance of not burdening the parents since they are already behind in rent and bills.  The children take on the burden of the lost shoes so that their parents won't have to deal with one more problem. Ali truly wants to make it up to Zhara for losing her shoes.  He gave her a pen he won for academic achievement, a simple gift that, although insignificant to you and I, is a generous and much appreciated gift between Ali and Zhara.  Ali tells Zhara about the opportunity to run in a race to win a pair of sneakers.  He promises Zhara he will win the sneakers for her. She is pleased and touched as Ali assures her he can win the shoes for her. The smile on her face is brilliant.  Ali is a fast runner and feels that he can win.  He has a tearful meeting with the coach and tries to convince him to try him out for the race.  Although he has missed the deadline, the coach decides to allow him to race after he sees how fast he can run.Zhara sees a young girl in the school yard wearing her missing shoes, she befriends the girl after she and Ali follow her home and they see that she has a blind father, they realize that she needs them as much as they do. Zhara is reassured of the girls' honesty when she returns Zhara's pen, the gift from Ali, to her after she saw Zhara drop it in the street.The race scene is suspenseful as we run along with Ali.  As he runs he envisions his sister going to school in his old shoes.  Ali is ahead in the race although he is running in the same worn shoes that he shares with Zhara each day.  Ali finds himself in 1st place as he comes toward the finish line.  He slows down and lets runners pass him by but finds that he is now in 4th place.  He struggles to regain his position and fate steps in again, causing Ali to finish in 1st place.  Ali cries because h has not won the shoes for Zhara.    Everyone is a little shocked that he is not excited to win 1st place with the prizes that it brings.  However, we know that although he wins the race, he lost the prize.  In his heart he has lost so much, he will continue to carry the burden until Zhara has shoes again.At home, Ali soaks his sore and blistered feet in a fountain as gold fish swim around.  Fortunately, the children are not to be burdened for much longer, in the final scene we watch the father buying shoes for Zhara and Ali with money he eared doing side work as a gardener on the rich side of town.  My only disappointment is that we don't get to watch them receive the valuable gifts. This movie shows the simple, unquestioned love between a brother and sister. Instead of the lost shoes coming between them, they make the best of it and become closer by working things out together. You are taken back to the purity and innocence of your childhood through Ali and Zhara.  This movie is about much more than a lost pair of shoes, it is about how a family is defined by the things that they do and how they treat each other.  Their actions and their decisions make them who they are.  Those that try to do right by others and care about people will be rewarded in the end, just not always in the way you expect you can.  Its not always in your control."
"Majid Majidi's Bacheha-Ye Aseman is a fascinating and deeply moving piece. It is a children movie which will be equally enjoyed by adults, and that's simply because it will take any adult back to their childhood days, back to the days when they did something wrong and were afraid to confess to their parents. The film was made with great simplicity and soul, and its impact is perfectly made through the characters of Ali and Zahra, two amazing kids who can set an example to anyone. Majidi brilliantly captures the world of these young golden-hearted creatures. They are smart, intelligent, innocent, respectful and caring. It's quite impressive to see how little kids pay respect to their seniors, what moral values they have, and their tender care for their parents' economic status and daily struggle is particularly moving. More than anything, it is their own sibling relationship which tugs at the heartstrings. Majidi's portrayal of the neighbourhood, the school where the kids study, and their own home, is most lifelike and authentic. Without a doubt, the script is the film's main winner, but the casting is one of the film's biggest strengths. Amir Farrokh Hashemian and Bahare Seddiqi are astonishing in their roles - charming, convincing, heartbreaking and totally relatable. You really feel for these kids and really want to settle their problems so that they can move on. This film is a true example of superb acting by child artists, and it shows how far they can go in their ability to explore the innocent spirit of childhood. Bacheha-Ye Aseman is a wonderful cinematic experience, which must not be missed by anyone. Just go and grab your seat, I assure it will keep you on the edge of it for one hour and a half and will be engraved in your heart long afterwards."
"I got the chance to watch this movie on a DVD for the first time 2 days ago.
Children of Heaven is a very good movie. And coming from Iran, I was impressed. The storyline may be simple, and you may think that you may not have anything to cheer about or feel angry about, believe me when I say this movie will make you feel a variety of emotions, from shocked to sad to happiness, to disappointment. I credit all that to the simple, yet extremely powerful story, the excellent direction and the magnificent charisma of the two young leads. They shone and they will draw you into the story. My most favorite scene for this movie is the marathon scene. The fact that Ali had to beg and cried to get a place in the running team was heart wrenching, and when the camera focused on Ali running, we will cheer and cheer him on when he fell back. There was total silence except for his sister's voice of blaming him for losing her shoes and as he ran, he kept seeing his little sister, carrying her schoolbag running and running to rush him his pair of shoes so that he can go to school was sad. And he ran and ran and realized he was going to get first place and I screamed, ""Don't! 3rd place Ali!"" and Ali ran a little slower and counted, ""one, two"" and he was third until one young man passed him and he was fourth and he ran harder and harder without thinking. In the end he won 1st place and got a free trip and his coach was overjoyed. But the tired Ali was silent and he was crying before the cameras. And when he went home, he couldn't say a word and his sister knew there was no shoes and she walked away disappointed and Ali sat by the fountain, with the goldfish in the pond nibbling at his blistered feet and he felt he had let his beloved sister down. That was the ending, but we all knew it will be a happy ending when his father comes home with the new pair of shoes, for both of them. And this was the success of this movie; you felt like you were Ali or Zahra and you will feel deeply for these characters.
10/10. The best foreign language movie I have ever seen on any subject which I feel justifies the full marks."
"this movie is one of the best movie i have ever see in my life...it was beautiful, it was well directed and the camera movements were pretty good, its just a small story with a big adventure, this movie shows love, happiness, and the poor people lives in Iran can't even afford to buy a pair of shoe..its a great movie...this whole movie is about the kid who lost the pair of shoes when he kept the shoe outside the store and the garbage man picks it up with all the other garbages, without knowing what to do, brother and sister lies to their mom and dad. the brother struggles so bad to get the shoe back somehowfor her sister, so she wouldn't be ashamed and hide her shoe before her friends.this movie is beautifully directed and itshould be rewarded 8.6/10."
"When I had heard that we were going to be watching an Iranian film in class, I was a bit apprehensive. I have experienced very little exposure to foreign films and was instantly put off by the subtitles. My trepidation was further reinforced when I was told to pay close attention to the pair of shoes in the beginning of the movie because they were a very integral part of the film. I couldn't imagine how something as trivial as a pair of shoes could keep me interested throughout the entire story. However, I am very happy to say that I was wrong in my preconceived notions. This film made me realize that the simple things in life truly are the most important.The characters that were chosen for this film were not real actors. This choice helped to make the film appear real and keep it from becoming sensationalized because of the actors. The sets that were chosen helped to contrast the poor area of Iran and the more modernized and wealthy area that Ali and his father visited in search of work. An interview that I came across that Ross Anthony from Hollywood Report Card gave to Majid Majidi, stated that the cameras used in the film were hidden, even from the actors. This allowed for a more natural feel as well as decreased the inexperienced actor's apprehensions.The surface theme of Children of Heaven is about Ali losing his younger sister, Zahra's, shoes and trying to make things right without the help of his parents. The family is extremely poor and Ali knows that his father is not in any position to buy another pair of shoes for Zahra. When looking further into this theme, I am amazed at the cultural differences in Middle Eastern and American lifestyles. I have no doubt that there are families in America facing extreme economic hardships that experience some of the sacrifices shown in this film. However, the United States is overall very materialistic and it is not often that we are exposed to families, especially children that are willing to make the sacrifices that the characters of this film made. Ali wanted to take direct responsibility for his sister and felt genuine remorse for the loss of her shoes. In most American films, the audience would be turned off by the main character, especially a boy, crying so often throughout the movie. In this case, Ali's love for his family is prevalent throughout the film and his strong emotions come across very heartfelt and sincere.In American films, the extremity of violence and other shock factors has become necessary in order to appeal to a desensitized audience. However, the simplicity of Children of Heaven had an ironically similar effect. In our society, we often lose sight of the little things in life and base our happiness around the cost and quantity of what we have. This film made me experience more emotions than many American films that I have seen. The importance of the Muslim's belief in the will of Allah impacted the way that the characters interacted and handled their disappointments. In American society, we tend to blame others for their misfortunes and expect them to be accountable for their own suffering. In contrast, Muslims believe that everything that they experience is what God has intended. In that way, suffering and misfortune take on very different meanings because despite your disadvantages, you are coming closer to God by following his will.Another difference in the cultural influences of this film is the importance of winning. In America, winning is everything and under no circumstances should you ever be content with losing. However, when Ali won the race he was completely disappointed that he had not finished third. Although the reason for his being upset is because he wanted to win the shoes for Zahra, for most Americans no circumstances would justify not wanting to come in first place. A large reason for this difference is again the importance of the will of God in the Muslim religion. I was extremely impressed with Children of Heaven and moved by the simplistic and powerful effect the film had on me. The idea that more is always better is proved wrong by this film and the impact that it has made on so many viewers. The extremely low cost of the film, the inexperienced actors, and the lack of technological advancements and images, gives the wrong impression about the quality of the film. In fact, the success of this film shows that the simple things in life are often more important."
"Finally I've gotten my hands on a copy of Majid Majidi's Children of Heaven (not illegally of course, but from the library's collection), and have set aside some time to viewing this much talked about masterpiece. And I couldn't agree more that the film is of great quality. I've often selected titles for my pop to view since he's retired, and have gotten a call from him during a working day that I MUST watch this film. Of course I had to clarify that Jack Neo's Homerun is an adaptation of it, given that he found some similarities in plot, but I must say, any movie is worth its salt if it can move my pops.There are so many things I like about Children of Heaven, and basically, the children Ali (Amir Farrokh Hashemian) and Zahra (Bahare Seddiqi) who play the siblings, will definitely tug at your heartstrings with their innocence. The story goes that Ali happened to lose his sister's shoes during an errand run, and coming from a poor family, that spells disaster. Not wanting to be punished for it, given that both understand the predicament they're in, and not wanting to trouble their parents with yet another expenditure, they devise an ingenious, somewhat mad hat plan, to share their shoes - Zahra goes to school in Ali's, before running back to exchange them so that Ali could attend his classes. And this leads to many comical moments and accidental scenes that will surely make you go ""awww"", culminating in an exhilarating foot race which will put you on the edge of your seat.But the skill here that Majid Majidi possess, is not to sledgehammer these emotions down your throat. Children of Heaven doesn't need to, but has in itself this magic that comes forth through its simple yet meaningful story, and through the strength of both children's acting. I was pretty amazed that both Amir and Bahare have this very charming and natural charisma in fleshing out their characters, their banter being excellent, and at times, without a need for words. Truly, they are the stars of this film, and their abilities will put some established big name actors to shame too. Majid Majidi has created characters that endear, but yet not out- of-reach fictional, as they are easily identifiable given that hey, these are the kind of sibling love, or blood being thicker than water, that almost everyone would have experience, or heard about.Being my first Majid Majidi movie, I'm definitely piqued to want to watch a whole lot more of his films. The movie has superb production values, and like any other foreign movie, opened my eyes to the cultural and physical landscapes of countries that I've yet to visit. What I liked about it also is its showcase of the family, how both Ali and Zahra show this strength in maturity with their helping around the house, and being sensible, well-liked kids. It justifies the number of awards that it has won in festivals everywhere, and if you haven't watch this, please do. It's definitely highly recommended stuff!"
"This is one of the most touching movies I have ever seen so far. It has to be seen by everyone, who wants great cinema with great messages. Nowadays there are very few films which combine these two. You should watch this beautiful example of modern cinema with your whole family (especially with your children) and not only once, because it will change your view on life, on property, on family and on friendship! This is the first movie by Majid Majidi I watched. Therefore I can't say anything about other films he has made, but I can say this about ""The Children of Heaven: ""Mr. Majid Majidi Thank You very much for this masterpiece of cinema!"""
"Majid Majidi's CHILDREN OF HEAVEN (2002) exists in radical opposition to various media representations of Iran Western viewers are most familiar with. Subversive politics, oil, female repression, terrorism, and hostage-holding irrational crazy people are not displayed in the film, images that pop into the average consciousness of a Westerner (i.e. the masses) when thinking of Iran. Quite the opposite is displayed alongside refreshing realizations that Iran is not entirely what Western media organizations have etched into the collective Western social unconscious. The value of Majidi's film for such Western viewers is its assistance in the mental decolonization process that might enable viewers to experience Iran absent from damaging Eurocentric stereotypes.CHILDREN OF HEAVEN is a beautifully simple film. Given the main characters are children, the film is set up from their perspective. Alongside Majidi's covert filming technique using hidden cameras to bring out the highest possible realism from his actors, the children are in an impoverished situation with the burden of acute familial responsibility that prematurely matures them. These children, although improvised, are not miserable as various media would suggest, but happy and contented. The narrative circles around a pair of lost shoes and the strive to attain a new pair that are sought not out of a materialistic need but a fundamental need reflectant of the culture's attitude towards possessions, an attitude different from the goals and desires of the spoiled, obscene American brat of Hollywood. Although the spoiled, obscene American brat might likewise be a stereotypical representation, within the context of discussing representations, it is significant to discern the contrast.Ella Shohat and Robert Stam note in UNTHINKING EUROCENTRISM* that Eurocentrism (or the belief in the supremacy of European culture and values whilst demonizing non-European or non-Western cultures and values as subservient) is ""endemic in present-day thought and education (and) is naturalized as 'common sense.'"" From this limited perspective, it is common sense to believe that people of the ""Middle East"" (a Eurocentric term) are suffering, crawling through the dirt, looking for the remnants of their families that had been blown to bits in a terrorist attack as a blood-stained Koran looms in the background. One might not venture too far from a film such as THE EXORCIST (William Friedkin, 1973) where a demonic spirit spawns from an archaeological dig site in the Middle East, possesses a white American girl, then is repressed and conquered by means of a Catholic priest to understand Eurocentric representations in Western culture and view the Middle East as mystical, evil and worthy of fear.What is scary, though, as Shohat and Stam note, these sentiments are accepted and normalized, etched into the fabric of the social unconscious. Just as the sky is blue and the grass is green, Eurocentricism elicits normalized depictions of Iran (or other countries in the Middle East) as a nation that births evil terrorists. But Ali and Zhara, the children of CHILDREN OF HEAVEN are anything but evil -- they are, rather, transcendent, ""of Heaven."" This is brought to fruition at the end of the film in the famous scene of the goldfish kissing Ali's feet in the circular communal pool in his village. Quite the opposite of a destroyer of peace, Ali IS peace.This goldfish image serves as a powerful device within the narrative, but more importantly, for Western viewers, serves in the mental decolonization process, a process that must be engaged to replace negative perceptions of a culture with truer renderings. The goldfish leaves viewers in an extremely calm space, almost meditative, a malleable ending hinting that there is much more to Iranian culture versus the ugliness presented via various media -- there is even beauty, emotion, and harmony. Such intense emotion yields great enjoyment, and, in CHILDREN OF HEAVEN, great enjoyment (and liberation) is gleaned for the sake of a culture previously thought of as demonic and regressive.While it is true Iran, like any country, has issues, it is important to remember these issues do not encompass the entirety of Iranian culture. When viewers focus only on what is bad, the beauty and value of Iran is forgotten, submerged beneath much negativity as unthinking Eurocentric beliefs are perpetuated and passed down to subsequent generations. CHILDREN OF HEAVEN reminds viewers of the unthinking thought-process Western minds so willingly accept -- the film helps humans realize there that the talking heads on their television sets might not be representative of absolute truth.*Shohat, Ella & Stam, Robert. UNTHINKING EUROCENTRISM: MULTICULTURALISM AND THE MEDIA. London and New York: Routledge, 1994"
"Nobody like Majid Majidi has recreated poverty and suffering of millions of people all over the world. His films show in a very natural, but dramatic way how poverty and culture and domination, both work together to cause social pain.He is a genius in the way he shows peoples feelings.The flower pot in the kitchen of the film Baran shows a clear example of his enormous power to show feelings.I hope the people in the industrialized countries learn more about other countries and poverty and suffering through films like this one.The color of Paradise is also a master piece of art."
"This is just one of the many excellent movies that came out of Iran in recent years. Again the story is simple but poignant. Again the amateur actors do a wonderful job in their role. This is truly a movie that's enjoyable from beginning to end.Out of 100, I gave it 89."
"Already 91 reviews for this movie, so why am I writing one. You'll know the answer if you have watched it. Children of haven is the pinnacle of story telling. When we are bombarded with star-studded high budget sagas, there are very few movies which leave an impact like this one. And Hollywood, beware, because Asians can tell stories like no one else in the world. The movie is gripping throughout, especially the last 15 minutes. When Ali tells Zahra that he'll come third in the race to get her those sneakers, I literally had tears in my eyes. And there was no stopping them once the race began. No background music, no special effects, but you could still feel the excitement and anxiety of Ali running for the cause. At that moment I realized, they truly are the Children of Haven. Its amazing how two of the most beautiful foreign films of all times got nominated for Academy in the same year (and eventually Life is Beautiful got the reward). But I can say Children of Haven must have given it a close fight. In all, it was a complete pleasure to watch Children of Haven. Don't miss it for anything."
"I know it may sound hokey, and I hope it doesn't put you guys off, but I was on the verge of tears from the very beginning. Only because of the very sweet and innocent relationship between the characters. Many times they are gruff, and difficult with each other, but you can't mistake the love. Your heart just completely opens and cheers on the two main characters, and I was really crying at the end. Only because it really touched my heart. I would have liked to have seen the ending a bit different. We are given a hint as to what was to come, but I would have preferred to see it, rather than just imagine what was going to happen.Wonderful movie, great for everyone who can either read the subtitles or know the two languages it's in. The two children are absolutely breathtaking in their emotional portrayals."
"Children of Heaven is a beautiful film that deals with a boy (9) and his sister (7) and their adventures over a lost pair of shoes. The film scores in the simplicity of the plot, executed with supreme performances, art direction and cinematography. The characterisation is wonderful; one can actually empathise with the siblings and their desperation to keep the secret. The chemistry between them can bring tears to your eyes. Majid Majidi has used basic elements of film-making sans glamour or loud background music or other tools of emotional manipulation, to narrate the story. This movie will be loved by one and all. Go grab your DVD!"
"I lived in Iran when I was younger that the children depicted here. It was also a long time ago (Truman was president). Nevertheless, this was very nostalgic for me.The plot is more than enough to carry this movie and entertain most adults and many pre-adolescents, but I wouldn't think anyone over 10 or under 30 would be riveted. Young Ali is like many a Hitchcock hero in that the unwanted circumstances he finds himself in are not his fault, but he doesn't really know that.""Children"" reveals things most Americans think they already know about Iran: Strong patriarchal society, strange mix of high tech and ancient coexisting comfortably, certainly not diverse the way we perceive it. There are some unintended revelations that are refreshing. Strong scholastic discipline among the middle classes, sibling bonding altruism that outstrips natural sibling rivalry, family values that are the equal of any anywhere, but, most beautiful to me, the greenery of the country. This last is not showcased, but all the more surprising because it's taken for granted. This is a beautiful land.This film should be mandatory viewing for all Department of State and Department of Defense employees and their bosses and their bosses' bosses."
"Before I ever set eyes on Children of Heaven I was told that it was an Iranian film that contained a clandestine layer of social criticism. While I watched I searched all over for signs that could help reveal this to me. Hidden symbolism of a corrupt and immoral power, purposeful ignorance, even Michael Moore. I could find none of these things. Now I knew it would be difficult considering that the movie was made to pass the conservative censoring that was in place to prevent such criticism from being displayed. I was beginning to think that all the talk of criticism was fabricated by imaginative literature teachers and film critics to make the movie more interesting. After reading others reviews of the movie on the Internet I found that I was not the only one who had difficulty in finding any hidden agenda in the movie. While this made me feel slightly better I knew I had to keep trying to find this movie beneath the movie. It came to me after a second screening of the movie, the title itself is a glaring sarcastic criticism of Iran. Calling Ali and Zhara the Children of Heaven is like naming a movie about modern day Iraq Uneventful Peaceful and Stable Nation. The fact that this name passed censors means that the decision must have been in the hands of a prideful, and arrogant censor.The title was not the only thing that stuck out at me the second time around. Comparing attitudes between the children and adults in the film you could see that the children when faced with a problem took it upon themselves to solve it, while circumventing any adult inclusion. To include their parents in the problem at hand would mean getting beat, and among other things adding to mounting problems. What was interesting was that the parents, unaware of their children's predicament, cared less about rectifying their problems than the children did about rectifying theirs. It is thought to tell if the children recognize this, and are working to become less like their parents to improve their condition in life, or their motivation is purely not to get beaten. Either way this situation opens up some pretty interesting thoughts on how Iran deals with their problems. Are setbacks, and problems the will of god and something that is meant to be, or are they the will of Iran and dealt with only under threat of punishment? Could the younger generations understand that problems are there to fix and pursue rather than mark down as a way of life?Overall I thought the film was very entertaining without the social commentary, and became transformed into a very meaningful, and surprising piece with the commentary."
"This movie is wonderful. I teach drama in an elementary school in PR and I showed this movie to my students.I wanted them to be exposed to a movie acted by children from a different culture. Language was no barrier for my students to enjoy and appreciate this movie. My students speak Spanish and the movie was in Farsi with subtitles in English. At the end they concluded that children from different cultures are all alike. Majid Majidi is an artist. With out the $$$ of Hollywood he makes movies that are far superior to all the silliness we have to see. I wish there were more movies like this one. It shows that true CINEMA does not depend of big names, fancy studios, digitalized effects, sugary plots and lack of imagination."
"This is a beautiful film, with the special poignancy that comes from seeing the world through the eyes of a child. The viewer is privileged to share in the innocence, hope, and beauty of these children, and also in their struggles. It is a film that portrays the universal truths of childhood and family and human brotherhood in the tradition of Padre Padrone and To Kill A Mockingbird. The acting is superb, the pacing is perfect, the images are haunting, and the story is full of emotion, but without sentimentality. Don't miss this film, and be sure to share it with your friends. If we embraced the Ali and Zahra in all of us, the world would be a better place."
"I am not able contain myself from commenting on this master-piece. My vocabulary fails me to praise this movie. The performance of Ali and his sister is unprecedented....marvelous....fabulous.....(English is a poor language!!). I could not shake of Ali's image from my memory for long.....the scenes that stands out are: When he informs his sister that he has lost her shoes....When he pleads for pardon from his school headmaster when he is found coming late to the school (because his sister comes late from her school to deliver the shoes)....and Ali pleads with his PT master to include his name for the running race... On the whole Majid Majidi has given a master piece to the world cinema. Kudos to the director and the cast. Note: Don't wait for an opportunity to watch this film......run to the near by VCD store, buy one and see it right now. What are you waiting for.....RUN."
"This film is not to be considered as more a novelty of an exotic country, as many productions of the third world are. Actually, it's superior to the smashing majority of the American films. It is touching in its simplicity, true in the feelings that it focuses, blinding in the sublime form as it approaches, starting from the simple story of a poor Iranian child, such universal subjects. Just extraordinary."
"One of the best movies I've ever watched.It's interesting how such a good movie can be made using a simple plot.The whole movie is a play of emotions. Actors were fantastic through out the movie. You could really feel what they are going through, you could feel their pain, love and disappointment. It was all very well reflected on their faces."
"This movie is amazing.  Every character is fully dimensional, which is a rarity and it's a smart trick to keep the audience fully involved throughout.  Majidi does this with our young protagonist and his sister, and he does this, amazingly, with those with smaller roles. His technique for making the kids speak volumes (tho they are obviously not ""trained & accomplished"" actors) is the use of their facial expressions, Parviz Malekzaade's attractive cinematography, and the musical score. What captivated me most about the film was that the story was told so well.  It's hard to find a good story teller, and it seems that we can trust Majidi with this.  The story is of a boy and his sister struggling with diffrent problems, but they become each others saviors. I can't think of ONE person who would dislike this wonderful gem."
"Neo-realism was the school of cinema developed by the Italians just after World War II. From 1945 to approximately 1954, directors like De Sica, Rossellini and Zampa delivered  masterpieces like Open City, Paisan, To Live in Peace, Shoe Shine, The Bicycle Thief, Umberto D and Miracle in Milan. But the Italian (not the World) audiences got tired of seeing poverty and everyday problems and demanded something more sophisticated. Federico Fellini added imagination to the down-to-earth themes of Neo-realism and gave the world a new concept of cinema. Neo-realism, it was said, was proper to poor, not to wealthy cinematic industries. It this was son, Iranian Director Majid Majidi accepted the challenge, and has made Children of Heaven, the most moving and perfect piece of neo-realism that has been filmed outside of Italy.  The story is much like that of The Bicycle Thieves: it's a pair of shoes that are stolen. But Majidi has provided us with the most wonderful performances from children that the screen has ever seen. A great story, magnificent color and camera work,perfect actors both children and adult, and a firm direction that never misses an opportunity to engage and captivate the audience.  I have never seen a better motion picture from that part of the world."
"Children of Heaven with a simple humor and simple actors, show us the hard life of two siblings and their family, the importance of a single pair of shoes, the concern for the economic situation of the family and the affection between the two children that it's shown when the boy removes sky and earth, so his sister can have a pair of shoes. Really beautiful and well done movie."
"The story of Children of Heaven can look fool and too simple to be a good one. But it's really good! Majid Majidi did a film about one poor family where the little son (Ali) lost his sister's shoes. As the family is very poor, Ali tries to keep it as a secret with his sister and doing this he would save his father from paying for new ones. In fact he was afraid of being beaten by his father too.
During almost one hour they show the pranks of the child. This part is very funny. Some scenes show Zarah (the sister) looking at other girls' shoes and then being shamefaced because his brother's were very large in her feet. One that is very beauty is when they are cleaning the shoes and they start to play with the bubbles. Then Ali discover that there will be a challenge where the third prize would be shoes. So, he enter in the challenge to get the third position. As many other Iranian films it's a little bit slow and not audacious. But the best is that it show us Iran as it is and not as the USA want us to believe. Everybody know that they do a lot of things with the woman because of the religion but it's not so exaggerated as American films show. If you see 'Not without my daughter', an American film, you may think Iran is the poorest, ugliest and worst place to live in the world. But when you see Children of Heaven you only think that they live in a different culture, in different ways. Now that I saw it I only think that Iran is a country as many other. The unique difference is that woman have to hide their hair. Only this. (Extreme generalization!)Watching Children of Heaven is a good and different experience. It's a delicate and ingenuous movie but it's touching in the same way."
"This is my favorite movie because no movie was able to touch my heart as this movie did.This is the best children movie ever made.I had seen it four year ago in television and after this i have seen it about 10 times and all the time i found it amazing.this movie is for family viewing and nothing is negative in the movie, but on the other side itis a very realistic movie.The best part of movie is it simplicity,even Hollywood should not be able to reach such level of film making. every character of the movie is very well portrait.the plot of the story was so simple and beautiful and very hearttouching.this movie is a masterpiece and should be in IMDB250."
"Now this is certainly the film that should have got the Foreign Language Oscar. A shame that the winner was ""Life is Beautiful"", by far the worst of the nominees.The story of the brothers that help each other in their small difficulties is extremely touching. Here we have a film that shows us real life and also remind us of our childhood and all the problems we had then, that we just forget with the years. Even the kid's race in the end is excellently made, making us cheer for the boy as never before.The cast is great, specially the brothers, and the director has certainly given us a lesson of directing. Congratulations to everyone involved in the making of this great movie."
"This film, which put Director Majid Majidi on the World Cinema map, is a piece of gem. The story revolves around a pair of shoes, or rather its absence; never did I imagine that a pair of shoes can sustain my interest for 90 minutes. Writer/Director Majidi tackles issues like poverty, necessity, selflessness, purity of childhood, sibling-love, perseverance and determination with such aesthetic and charm, without being melodramatic.After five minutes into the movie, the kid Ali confesses to her sister Zahra that he lost her shoes and he couldn't find them; the innocence and sadness portrayed in this scene draws you into their lives immediately. The two kids are the heart and soul of the movie, and carry the movie forward with their range of genuine and varied emotions; the director draws out such powerful and sublime performances out of them. Even the supporting performances of Ali's father and the-small-girl-in-school are quite commendable.Losing something you're entrusted to, getting into trouble at home/school, asking your sibling/friend to cover up for you, sharing responsibilities when someone you care is sick, determination to win something with a larger goal in mind - these themes are so universal that a kid or adult from any place could easily relate to. The story might seem too linear and optimistic to some, but it portrays a world of love and selflessness. People, especially kids, with lesser means are often more selfless and helpful than their fellow beings with more riches; they appreciate and understand the value of even the simplest and smallest of things.The incidents, the adventures, and the whole running around due to the missing pair of shoes teaches them a lot of things. All the running around eventually pays off when Ali gets selected into the school race team; we never really realize how we acquire certain talents.Other than the brilliant acting, the artistically shot scenes and the remarkable background score add to the beauty and feel of the movie. The seven-minute kids' race sequence towards the and is quite craftily shot and directed. There are so many scenes which are memorable, and stay etched in your mind for a long time."
"I had been postpone of watching this movie so many times,but once i was checking movies randomly as which movie i have to watch today?then accidentally i have seen this movie. OH majid majidi, i had fallen in love with your kind of story telling, this CINEMA has changed my perception about the CINEMA , the best move i have ever seen in my lifetime as﻿ i can say with no doubt.i smiled when the children had smile,i cried when they cried instinctively, i have experienced it as it should be. cinema doesn't need big budget, computer generated images,stars when this kind of director is there...there is nothing to say about story,it has just one line as the boy lose her sister shoes,until they get new pair they should be adjust with one pair of shoe in daily bad circumstances at that age.love you majid majidi."
"I write as someone who not only loves this film, but as someone who understands how much a pair of shoes is worth.As I write this, I have about $25 in the bank. I have no other money. I struggle each day to find meaning... and stable work. I have worked all my life... until recently. And now my pair of shoes is at least 2 years old... and I make sure I don't wear them out.Watching this film again, I can appreciate this story as being more than allegorical. There is symbolism in the film but its literal meaning is as potent as its often poetic images.So, to anyone who believes this film to simply be a modern analogy... it isn't. There are definitely people living in our world today living under weighty consequences of losing their protective sole. I am one of them. What I hope this film does for me... and for anyone else who loves this movie... is to help keep our spirits buoyant when life hands us over-sized hand me downs. I know it has reminded me that my shoes look a darn sight better than the ones in this story and yet the characters managed to still keep striving in life. The one thing they never did, was give up.I hope this ode to love of family, devotion to hope and having a forgiving heart will be one of my beacons, giving me direction towards light when the dark bleak nights of the soul smother me.This work of motion picture art seems dedicated to all of us who don't have much left in the world except our human hearts. Our need to live for better things. Our desire to hold on to love and the people most dearest to our souls. This is a film about being brave in a world that can easily run us over. If these 2 small children can hold on to hope, perhaps all of us can too."
"You have given me something that I can cherish for a lifetime. The characters were believable and immaculately portrayed . The story though simple and for some trivial unravels like a poetry, spellbinding and so riveting, that it takes us right into the world of Ali and Zahara. The child actors are stunning to say the least and only the hardest of souls will not be moved. Its totally different than all the crap that comes out nowadays with all the stars, money and special effects minus the soul. This movie has a soul and every frame emotes such innocence that I have never ever seen before. This is what movie making is all about and I just cant stop thinking about it. The climax is a triumph with Ali giving a virtuoso performance."
"I was in nexus of one movie on star movies two days before named. ""children of heaven""...that was accidentally..because the movie was at late night...& i do like to watch the movies at prime time & mostly sci-fi, action, comedy & some time sensitive...but This movie I came in to watch was great experience.It was a persian, iranian, English language film...It is a story of two children Ali & Zahra, very briefly crafted, & what a language that was, very simple & polite, even a moderate English speaking person can also understand it.Such a sentimental story...Ali takes his little sister Zahra's shoes to the shoemaker to be repaired, but loses them on the way home. The siblings decide to keep the predicament a secret from their parents, knowing that there is no money to buy a replacement pair and fearing that they will be punished.They devise a scheme to share Ali's sneakers: Zahra will wear them to school in the morning and hand them off to Ali at midday so he can attend afternoon classes. This uncomfortable arrangement leads to one adventure after another as they attempt to hide the plan from their parents and teachers, attend to their schoolwork and errands, and acquire a new pair of shoes for Zahra. Zahra sees the shoes on a schoolmate's feet, and follows her home, but the two soon become friends.Ali enters a high-profile children's footrace in the hope of receiving the third prize of a new pair of sneakers. He accidentally places first and wins another prize instead.The film ends with Zahra finding out that she will not get a new pair of shoes, but there is a quick shot of their father's bicycle at the end of the movie that shows what appears to be the red shoes Zahra had been focusing on earlier and another pair of white sneakers, presumably for Ali, whose old sneakers were torn from so much use. The film ends with the final shot showing blisters on Ali's feet. Some versions include an epilogue revealing that Ali eventually achieves the larger-scale success of having a racing career.that brother-sister moments were made us very calm & heart pulsating..great to watch...I will not miss the chance if I get to see it again"
"Children of Heaven is a movie that strays away from the fast paced, action packed thriller that most Americans, like me, are familiar with. The editing and framing are done in compliance with Iranian rules about propriety. Men are never shot in the same scene with women that they are not married to or have a family orientation with, but children, as it is allowed by Iranian standards, are shown in any context with each other and any other adult. The pace of the movie is significantly slowed down from the Western motion picture custom and the scenes, as well as the people, are all real. This is to say, that there are no professional actors in the majority of the movie and the scenes are that of real Iranian cities, schools, and homes; there are no sets. The literary elements of the film are dealt with at a unique angle as well. The plot is based on the folly of Ali as it relates to his sister's cherished shoes, a ratty pair of children's shoes, and the pursuit, after they have been lost, of returning those shoes to Zahra: Ali's sister. The development of the story is slow but charming, in my opinion, as the journey to the regain the shoes is drawn out over the entirety of the film but treated with specificity while using allegory to point out struggles between traditional and modern day Iran in relation to the government of Iran and its impinges on the citizens therein. The characters and conflict are uncomplicated and delightful, seeing that they are simply about common people dealing with common problems. The real impact of the film is shown in how these common people care for these common blunders that any of us are likely to make; dealing in courageous ways and in observance with honorable means to meet the objectives that each has set forth to accomplish. The social commentary is invisible to the untrained eye, but no less exists clearly within the context of the film to show how each sect of the Iranian society experiences the pleasures and obstacles that are present in modern Iranian life. One such example of this social commentary exists within the relationship of the school principal (symbolizing the government of Iran), Ali's teacher (symbolizing the educated middle class), and Ali himself (symbolizing the lower, working class citizens of Iran). Also, the use of water throughout the movie symbolizes the will of God and is done so with loving consideration, best represented at the end of the movie that closes with Ali's blistered feet resting in a pond (symbolizing that submission to God's will is the best place for anyone and their concern to be). I really enjoyed this film after I understood the context of which the story took place and of what purpose it set out to achieve. Children of Heaven gave me great insight into a society of which I was previously unfamiliar with. I highly recommend the film to anyone who wants to know more about Middle Eastern cultures, especially Iran. In the end, the film points out, rather nicely, the importance of an honorable journey to a principled end while explicating that coming in first, or having the most, are not the most essential pursuits in life. Children of Heaven is a charming story with a profound message that many of us fail to recognize and sometimes all it takes is a simple story about a simple pair of shoes to bring us back."
"When my college professor chose this film to show, I was a bit skeptical as to whether I would enjoy this movie. This was my first time watching an Iranian film. I was surprised to find myself feeling so many different emotions for Ali and his sister Zahra. This is the type of movie that brings happy tears in the end. This film provides you with a story of compassion and love for one another. In the Children of Heaven, a brother shows concern and guardianship for his little sister. This type of behavior towards siblings in the United States is less likely to happen. Therefore, I was surprised at how thoughtful people of Iran treat others they care for. After learning about the Middle East and their relationship with God, I was able to see the symbolisms that the director was portraying. The actors based outcomes in the movie as their belief that the will of God is more powerful than any other belief. Ali coming in first place in the race was a will of God. This might be why Zahra was not upset with him when he returned home empty handed. The director chose to capture the sense of being a child. His film angles were set low at a child's level so the audience could follow along with the kids and relate to them. In addition, the movie shows that the younger generation of Iran seems to be more in control with changes and are willing to change. The older generation of Iran seems to be set in their ways and change is not comfortable with them. This might be why you get the sense that the children are more knowledgeable and clever than their parents and elders. This film is a must see for anyone who is a sucker for tearful happy endings. If you appreciate different cultural beliefs and ideas, chances are Children of Heaven will make you smile."
"I believe that we tend to view people from Iran, or other parts of the Middle East, as one-dimensional people.  We read news stories, listen to politicians, never hearing about the mundanities of everyday life.This story is about 2 sibliings faced with a dilemma: the boy loses his sister's shoes, leaving one pair of shoes between them, which they share. While this might not be such a travesty in the USA, for these children, it's about the worse thing that can happen to them.  They understand their parent's circumstances and never tell them, almost knowing that it would add to their miserable financial circumstances. Watch the film to see how the boy tries to fix the situation.Beautifully filmed, nicely acted, with a not-overly preachy message, it would be a good film for any self-indulgent teenager to see, the next time they argue with their parents over money for the newest or latest status symbols."
"Cost $180K, grossed a million! Here's why in my opinion.Humanity at it's best, as seen through the eyes of a child. Through Majidi's artful directorship we get an intimate understanding of two children's (Ali & Zahra) thoughts, feelings, and intentions from start to end. C.O.H. highlights some very important basic (and increasingly more scarce) core values: courage, honesty, cooperation and faith (and others).Hard work and co-existence... in a simple village within Tehran, a personal tragedy unfolds between 9-year-old boy (Ali), and his 7-year-old sister (Zahra). These children live with their parents in a bare-bones, one-room flat; the family is faced with a life of poverty and no perceivable future otherwise; each member takes part in doing everything he or she can to survive. The viewer has an opportunity to relate, even connect personally with the characters, thanks to the authenticity of plot, filming, and acting. Humanity at it's best, the real deal. This film helped me appreciate children's innocence and the poisoned thinking I sometimes have, about teaching my own children too much too soon."
"It was a rather peculiar experience to watch Children of Heaven again, on one hand it brought back a lot of the feelings that I had when I first watched it as a kid and how the lives of those two children resonated with me back then for so long, and on the other hand I can see now how masterfully this piece of art is crafted with my (rather) more experienced eye and so I decided to write my first review ever.
Children of Heaven is a very simple story about an -insignificant- event in the -not so important- life of two Iranian children, it is literally a story conceived with a pair of shoes in the center of it! and yet it succerds in what so many Hollywood blockbusters fail, that is speaking to its audience sincerely and creating characters that we really care for.
You don't need a tragic backstory about a psychologically traumatized childhood for your character or a first class celebrity to take the role in order to make the audience feel the character, it is much more subtle than that.. And Majidi shows us how it's done! (by the way I have to give a shout out to the little children that took the leading roles in the film for their outstanding and touching performances).
Like Grave of The Fireflies, Children of Heaven is about a brother-sister relationship in an environment that is not adequate for their innocence and yet they find meaning in the most insignificant of things, and like Bicycle Thieves, the father-son relationship faces difficulties but is never broken. It is the interpersonal relationships that give these characters a reason to fight the cruel lives they face and find meaning in it.
Children of Heaven, like its two coumterparts, are examples of storytelling at its best.. They don't force anything on you, they don't rely on schmaltzy music or melodramatic special effects, they respect the viewer as not to tell them how to feel at a particular moment, and they all depict ""real"" life no make-up or sugar on the top, just the plain life we all live and see.
I should also point out for the subtle social and economical criticism that Majidi displays in his film, showing us the big differences between the classes and yet not depicting the rich as evil and selfish or the poor as the persecuted heros.
In the end we're left with an ending that's the perfect metaphor for life itself, not a happy ending nor a sad one nor anything actually, it's just there.. This type of ending might as well be of impact on the Iranian cinema as another outstanding Iranian film, A Separation, had a similar type of ending.
In conclusion, Children of Heaven is the type of films that we should all watch from time to time to remind ourselves of life as it is not as it's presented through most of the media. simple but profound are the best words to describe it.
Stay well.."
Awe inspiring film. You can't miss this film if you love cinema. Performances of the child actors will remain with you till your last breath. Classic example of simple and honest story telling.
"Majority I am always watching modern movies, but when i see this i felt like why i missed these kind of movies! those child actor and actress given sweet feeling to me .... highly recommended to watch! you won't regret about your time!"
"This is the one movie, one can only relish by watching. It's too good despite being made cinematographically simplest possible way. The contemporary social fabric of impoverished family with binding of siblings to its purist possible ways. Do you need to waste time in watching larger than life movies & actors? Neyh, watch this. It's pure like water."
"Every time I watch an Iranian film I am amazed, it's not only Kiarostami, also Asghar Farhadi and Majid Majidi delight us with that special taste of simplicity and beauty. This film is so simple, the conflict is so childish, the approaching is so innocent that you find yourself sharing the anguish the little characters have to deal with, even when the problem is not such a big one. If you side this with a superb photography work and with the great work of all the actors involved (How he managed to reveal such natural emotions on those kids???) what you get is a genuine piece of charming cinema, with images and emotions that will follow you long after the film has concluded. Watch this film if interested on how other cultures face day-to-day, and how children see the environment they're surrounded by. Simply beautiful."
"A different world, different relations, different love...All in one.If you are not sure about the meaning of life - after this movie you'll be more confident that it has some :)This is a movie that puts smile on your face. A movie that grabs your deepest and most sincere emotions and brings them out to the surface. It makes you feel like... purified. At some moments during the movie I asked myself if such story could be real... If such relations could exist...I feel they could.A film about pure and innocent love. See it - it'll make your day, week... or life better."
"The movie, Children of Heaven, in many ways could be described as a struggle from within. During the entire movie, moral dilemmas were presented and these two children had to make a choice. The author seems to represent in the two children the openness to change. This could be seen in many cases during the movie. The author portrays the two children changing and adjusting to all the different situations. This shows that the children of Iran are more open to change and more able to change then the later generations. This could also represent Modernity vs. tradition.Another main theme that was portrayed in the movie was sacrifice. Ali sacrificed many things throughout the movie, to try and find the shoes, and to make sure is his sister had shoes. Ali sacrificed getting kicked out of school for his sister. Ali's school began when his sister's school ended. And Ali would wait for his sister to switch out his school. Another sacrifice that Ali made was the sacrifice of his own shoes. After the race at the climax of the movie, Ali begins to take off his shoes. Not only are his feet covered in blisters, but his shoes are completely ruined from running the race. So the author portrays the fact that Ali was willing to ruin his own shoes in order for his sister to have shoes.To comfort his sister while she waits to get her shoes back, Ali makes sacrifices and gives her his nice pencil, and his gold pin. Ali's desire to get his sister Zahra's shoes back eventually leads to lust to get her shoes back. Ali even sacrifices playing sports with his friends to go and help his dad work on his day off. Ali's struggle to get his sisters shoes back and his ability to change, shows the audience that the younger generations are more able to change and conform to the growing economy."
"I watched with my eight-year-old and she really enjoyed it! She said it was one of her favorite movies. It was her first time watching a movie with subtitles, but she was able to keep up with it. I really think this is one of the best family movies I've seen in a long time. The bond between the brother and sister was simply beautiful! The movie also gave us a peek inside of the life of an Iranian family. The brother was selfless and his father was a very moral man. I wish the ending would have been a little more tight, but other than that I was pleased with the movie."
"So simple yet so sophisticated. This has to be one of the most heartwarming and heartbreaking movies ever made. Western societies who take so much for granted will receive a real eye opener when they view this movie. The storyline is so straightforward and simple yet at the same time, puts you so close to the characters and makes it all so realistic that you will be completely drawn in. The performances of the two children, the brother and sister, are absolutely incredible, yet so disciplined. With all this political nonsense about the US going to war with Iran and all, people should see more of films like these and gain a proper perspective of things around the world. I'll be looking for more Iranian films like these."
"This is the great movie I never saw before, which is directed by Iran ppl. probably I did't see more Iran movie cos I am fresh movie fan. And I believe that I should pay close attention to this country and her culture in the future! I am strong interest in this kind of movie, such as PEACOCK (chinese movie, is great as well). The whole story is focus on one pair of lost shoe, which belongs to Ali's little sister. All people is so kind that I can't help to cry almost! when Ali and his sister found the lost shoes eventually, wore on other schoolmate girl's foot, they traced her and found the truth! she is a poor girl as well. Then both of them never say anything and go back to home! what is a moving scene! I addict to this kind of movie, such as PEACOCK, which is made by China. I recommend that all fans should take a look this movie. And you can understand well what's happening at that years in China. I heard the director's name-Majid Majidi. I thought he did other good movie cos I never got chance to investigate on the internet! I want to write my feeling and comments on the IMDb first!"
"Love and Irony in a setting probably unfamiliar to most Westerners. You'll feel the characters pain and their love! The film print is a bit tortured but this lends to the realism of the plight these people are going through. Shot in Iran (Persian mono comp with English Subtitles),the scenery is something most of us in the U.S. have never seen (Mostly due to the sanctions imposed after the embassy hostage takings in the 70's). All the special FX in the world could not have conveyed better, the terror of going down a hill on a bike with no brakes. Word.~sct"
"Being American born of Persian ancestry, I've always tried to seek out Persian cinema, and had heard about Children of Heaven from various family members.  I finally was able to see it tonight and am terribly pleased I did. I loved seeing Ali's and Zahrah's relationship with each other...as someone commented here, it is touching without being sentimental.  Majidi didn't set out to make sentimental film - it is straightforward in its approach even dealing with the poor section that Zahrah and Ali live in.I must add also I'm always happy to see a movie that doesn't show Iran in a fundamentalist/terrorist light.Another movie if you enjoyed this one, is Panahi's The White Balloon which also is about a child's plight (this time involving goldfish)."
"This movie makes me wonder about my life. It kept me going on thinking that those that are really poor might teach us some insight about their uphold values and expectations. With this movie, I realised, how  sometimes I become forgotten to connect spiritually with God. Ali's family is poor but still they uphold the values of faith given by others to them. I began to appreciate what life offers at us. The characters in this movie is well played. Every characters seem convincing enough. Oh, I could always feel Zohra and Ali's heart-wrenched feeling when the Zohra's shoes  were gone. Their  plan was  almost successful but then, the  shoes  that Ali has is in poor condition. I could feel their gladness for even the shoes is in  poor condition, they are still able to go to school with it. I urge you all to go watch this movie (if you haven't done so)! It shall make you see life in different light."
"I just saw Children of Heavens with my friends. The story line is simple but adorable. The plot revolves around Ali and his younger sister, Zahra. Ali just lost Zahra's shoe and the two find a solution of wearing Ali's snicker to go to school. Since their family is poor, both of them didn't want their father to find out about the lost shoe and try their best to keep it a secret. Zahra would run home from the morning school in the afternoon to give Ali his snicker so he can go to school. When a race was on, Ali entered the race when he saw the third prize: a pair of snicker. The story end with a heart wrenching, deep family values between Zahra and Ali."
"This was a wonderful film.  Working with children, I can appreciate the real reluctance Ali has to confide his problem to any of the adults in his life. Nothing about the children's emotions felt stilted or unreal in this film. The father, who might have been played as some kind of ogre, comes off as a real person too.  How unusual for a film to see the world from both sides of the gap of age.I only wish there was a ""translated"" version as well as a subtitled version so that I could show it to some of my younger audiences.  American audiences aren't used to the kind of ending in this film, but it would make for some great discussions.  (And of course, experiments to see if we could learn how to make soap bubbles without anything but our hands!)Highly recommended."
"In the 1997 film, Children of Heaven, from director Majid Majidi, the audience is presented with a modern view of Iranian issues. The film portrays an allegorical story in which the current levels of Iranian social order are symbolized through children. The director also, inadvertently, discusses the role of Islam in the lives of Iranians. All of these issues are important to note because they assist the audience in fully understanding the film. I will provide the reader with a brief plot summary, followed by examples of significant symbolism, and finally discuss the director's motivations for portions of the film.This interestingly creative commentary on the Iranian way of life begins by offering the audience with their first bit of symbolism in the opening scenes. The audience is shown a wide lends shot of a shoe cobbler fixing a decrepit, old shoe that looks as if it belongs to a young girl (which we are later shown is the case). It is apparent that the shoe carries great significance because it is the film's longest scene and is the object that keeps the plot in constant momentum. Once the shoe is fixed by the man it is given back to Ali, the film's main character who portrays the youth of Iran, and who also loses the shoe when he put it down at the market. He returns home without the shoe to tell his sister that it was lost but that he will find it. This is where the audience first sees their home and how poor they are, a common reality for a large number of Iranians. The plot of the film centralizes around Ali's determination to retrieve the lost shoes which appear to always be around the corner. This may be another comment from the director in regards to change in the lives of Iranians and how he thinks it is just around the corner.The audience is presented with characters along Ali's journey that stand for things such as the Iranian government and citizens both impoverished and wealthy. The students of children's school are shown each day in the courtyard in straight rows where they all are directed to repeat after the teacher who is announcing rules through a megaphone. This is an apparent representation of the government's role and of the citizens'. The audience is also submerged with countless examples that represent the will of God or Allah; with the use of water which symbolizes purification, and through the different characters and settings. When we meet the little girl who is wearing Zahra's shoes and then is followed home by Zahra, we see that she is very poor also and her father is blind. But even though their situation is a rough one, one that is very similar to most Iranians, they are still very happy. I think this sums up what the director has in store for the future of Iranians.In conclusion, I felt that the film was very moving and spoke about numerous issues such as poverty, the relationship between us and God, and the relationship between man and government. I think that the director's use of children to convey his message is very innovative and I feel it was a success. It is not hard to see why after viewing the film, that it was so popular among critics. Lastly, I believe that the director's choice of ending is meant to leave the audience with whatever they imagine as the importance because so many people have so many ideas of what the future has in store for Iran."
"I watched Three Iranian movies in as many days (The Day I Became A Woman, A Moment of Innocence and then, Children of Heaven) and now I want to locate a bad Iranian film. I got all these three above movies from the Los Angeles Public Library, and I've decided to now finish watching all the Iranian movies they have (Including the ones without any subtitle) and try to find a bad movie among them.I loved this movie, mainly because this narrative is very succinct. ***SPOILER BEGINS***** For example, I do not know how many of the viewers noticed the father carrying two pairs of new shoes at one point of time! ***SPOILER ENDS*** It is also a bit unpredictable. Any formula movie, by default, must make the central character win every contest, whereas an art house movie must make him/her lose and end with despair. Not quite this movie!This movie reminded me of Umberto D., a masterpiece by the ""Boss of All Bosses"", Vittorio De Sica.It deserves a 10, but for a couple of scenes that were not fully convincing: One involving a dog, and another that involves an accident."
"it's the first time i got to see an Arabic film. before watching, i talked to myself ""just try and have an experience of new style. forget about the crazy Arabic. anyway at least a break from Hollywood""however, when i started i found myself totally absorbed into this movie, which is so plain and pure about a little boy and his sister, who had to go through with only one pair of schooling shoes. it's just simply an episode of childhood life, but through Majidi's direction, it like happened yesterdaylooked through other comments at this site, i quite agree that some feeling are common among all human beings, whatever their color, language or belief. it just lays there, so quietly that we could even ignored its existence. it can't be simply built by money. Hollywood can make some visually fantastic movies, but for heart-touching ones i'd rather say goodbye to Hollywood temporarily two leads share a pair of shoes, while it's a bicycle that in another Chinese movie called Beijing Bicycle. after seeing this, i think it's better than Beijing Bicycle. for one thing, it sounds more fictional for two boys sharing a bicycle for totally different purpose; for the other i don't think the latter copes well the love inside, which appears somehow abrupt for me. while in Majidi's film, Ali and Zahra make the story just like happen around yourself. you're part of Ali run through the race and come back with disappointment. i can see no artificial in their performance, just so naturally by the way, who's the guy composed the sound track? i find it very beautify and goes pretty well with the movie. someday i'm gonna find it for myselfPS:sometimes just feel it necessary to write something, maybe just help me to remember a good movie when i'm old?"
"Commenting this movie is total useless.Because it holds so much beauty in it's simplicity.The plot is simple, the actings, the casts, the musics, the cinematography, the arts.And yet it hold us dearly. Bring us to the daunting passion of love and pain, laugh and tears.As the movie ends, we left with a simple thought in our minds, a simple teaching of love. Simple love and simply love.One of the best family movie for every occasion."
"Being an ardent fan of realistic movies, Children of Heaven came as a perfect antidote to my fading belief in unadulterated love. The plot line, although rather simplistic has managed to collate multiple facets of growing up in financially decrepit circumstances. While Ali tries frantically to endure the month till his father can afford a new pair of shoes for Zehra, I was taken back to childhood days and I could feel the Ali wailing inside me, repenting for our mistakes and innocuously hiding them. My favourite moment in the movie was at the end where Ali ends up crying because he won the race and failed to come third, which would have given him a new pair of shoes as the prize money. We also get to see the reason why they are truly children of heaven, when Zehra decides to forgive her school friend whom she suspects has her stolen shoes, on finding out that her father was blind. Rarely do movies bring out such brilliant moments of human empathy. A must watch and it definitely goes into my list of all time favorites."
"Ali has a problem. He has just lost the prized pair of shoes of his sister, Zahra. He tries to find them but to no avail. Now he and Zahra have to share shoes at school, a situation which causes all sorts of problems. Ali comes up with other plans to get Zahra a pair of shoes. Meanwhile, Zahra thinks she may have tracked down the new owner of her shoes.Sweet movie from Iran. The spin-off events from the loss of the shoes and the adventures of the kids are quite entertaining. Also a great, warmth-filled reminder of life's simple pleasures and how things which may seem unimportant to one person in one culture and/or socio- economic sphere can be vitally important to someone with different circumstances.Not particularly profound though. The movie doesn't really come up with much in the way of profundities or even a powerful conclusion (in fact, the conclusion is fairly weak). It's a simple, linear story with very few frills or great twists, told engagingly and with great warmth.The movie was nominated for Best Foreign Film at the 1999 Oscars, losing out in the end to Life is Beautiful."
Kudos to the director who marvelously used the spell bound charisma of his direction into he characters of the well written script and did justice to the writer as well. Ali and his sister played seriously award winning role. the emotions are heart touching and worth watching movie. And to all directors and script writers '' heavens of children'' would always remains a challenge and inspiration as well.
"A masterwork of heartfelt grace, endless warmth & soulful compassion, Children of Heaven is an affectionately crafted, tenderly structured & wonderfully performed coming-of-age drama that not only paints a beautifully evocative portrait of siblings relationship but also offers a very captivating glimpse into the lives of lower-class Persian society.Set in an impoverished neighbourhood in Tehran, Children of Heaven concerns a young boy whose routine is thrown off-balance after he misplaces a pair of shoes that belonged to his sister. Promising to make up for the loss and requesting her to not mention the incident to their parents, the two devise a scheme to solve the problems on their own in the meantime.Written & directed by Majid Majidi, the film features a very simple premise which is then brought to life in a very humane & humble manner. Despite the poor neighbourhood setting, the story doesn't have an ounce of cynicism in it, for all Majidi is concerned with is illustrating the siblings bonding & their shared predicament after the shoes go missing. It's pure, kind-hearted & delightfully sweet.Set pieces are kept to a minimum, plot is firmly rooted in reality, and there is a very naturalistic feel to how its events unfold. The two kids play their part very convincingly and are finely supported by the rest of the cast. Pacing is steady throughout its runtime, and keeps its childhood spirit alive till the very end. And its blissful tone & adorable quality is further amplified by its mesmerising score.On an overall scale, Children of Heaven is an exquisite, nostalgic & intimate cinema that captures the essence of childhood in full-fledged fashion and brims with heartwarming themes that reflect the goodness in humanity. An adorable, innocent & refreshing delight that begins on an arresting note and culminates on an emotional high, this Persian gem is absolutely worth your time & money. Thoroughly recommended."
"I really happy to see this type of movie; thanks for all. I want to this type movie in future. We can make this beautiful movies on next year. Children of Heaven really good movie.I do respect people's faith, but I don't respect their manipulation of that faith to create fear and control. It's happy us."
"When reading up about the Iran New Wave (INW) one of the first titles I found out about was Majid Majidi's Children of Heaven. Intrigued by the details,I was disappointed in being unable to track a good print of the movie down. Checking on what films were about to go from Netflix UK,I was thrilled to find an INW film,that I hoped would be heavenly viewing.The plot:Going to get shopping for his family,Ali puts the new shoes his dad ordered for his sister Zahra on the side for a minute.Coming back with a shopping bag,Ali finds that the shoes have been taken. Thinking of the money issues facing the family,Ali tries to keep things hidden. Secretly talking to Zahra,the siblings make a deal of each taking it in turns to wear Ali's old sneakers between classes. Believing that this is the new path they must walk,Ali is thrilled to learn of a contest that might let him make things up to Zahra.View on the film:Keeping the camera at Ali and Zahra's level,writer/director Majid Majidi & cinematographer Parviz Malekzaade masterfully cut rustic INW Neo-Realism with the dramatic heft of the Sports Drama. Keeping costs as low as possible by shooting on location, Majidi gives the side streets of Tehran an earthy atmosphere brushed with lingering shots breathing in the daily life of the family and small tracking shots getting beneath the busy streets of the town. Stepping into the ""sports movie"" Majidi balances the earthy setting with elegant slow motion that brings out the loud gasps from Ali in his desire to make up for his mistake.Lacing a bond between brother and sister,the screenplay by Majidi gives an extraordinary richness in the daily lives of the family,as Majidi brings to light the smallest moments between the family,from Zahra and Ali writing less than secret notes to each other,to Ali having to run out in the rain to put his torn sneakers in the family shoe area. Joining Ali in putting running shoes on, Majidi wonderfully skips over Sport movie clichés by keeping Ali's contest firmly linked to the family troubles that give the film a touchingly poetic final note. Criss-crossing school runs under the noses of their mum and dad, Amir Farrokh Hashemian and Bahare Seddiqi give magnificent performances as Ali and Zahra,thanks to Seddiqi giving Zahra a taut sharpness, whilst Seddiqi gives Ali a nose to the grindstone determination to find some heavenly footwear."
i was searching some great movies to watch after watching Pan Nalin's Samsara movie & Inaritu's 21 Grams movie. because i can't remove the movements of that movies after watching them. so i wanted to find more movies like them. I thought that there were no movies like them. but when i met this movies i couldn't find words to explain about this movie. i think Majid Majidi has did a great work with those kids. i writing this review right after watching movie. still i can't remove the expressions of them from my head. I suggest you all to watch movie. If you miss this it will be a really miss for you. I can't imaging how director has do this work with those kids. They are doing really great job in the movie.
"I wasn't prepared to see the movie because it was the first time I am seeing a foreign movie which has no English/action/sci-fi in it. I was little afraid that I might waste the time watching the movie as I am not aware of what it was about. At the end, thank god! It has a very simple story line - a brother helping his sister - in a very tender and sweet yet with some sore in it. His plans, efforts for the cute loving sister is what that makes this movie a masterpiece if one has to say. If Godfather is a masterpiece in its stylish don genre, well this one says ""one can also make a masterpiece with a simple story like this"". Godfather made me love that movie, characters but this movie taught me what is love!Must watch and it will be a emotional experience for all of us."
