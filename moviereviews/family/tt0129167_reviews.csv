"I'm 25 years old.  I have no children.  So why am I praising a 'kid's movie' which nobody saw?  Because I have never seen a film pack the emotional wallop 'The Iron Giant' provided.The film's plot is similar to 'E.T.' - a young boy meets an alien robot from outer space, who is stranded on earth, and runs afoul of paranoid government agents.  Not to knock the Spielberg film, but what makes 'The Iron Giant' the better film is that the young boy is the teacher.  It is he who has to teach the Giant about the beauty of life, the difference between good and evil, and choices we have to make.  The Iron Giant, it turns out, is a weapon, who has to struggle against his own nature.  The film has an obvious (and timely) gun control message, but its real message is about the choice we make when dealing with other people.  We can use our powers for good or lash out at everyone around us.I dare not give away the climax.  All I will say is that it features a sacrifice absolutely breaktaking and emotionally shattering (albeit somewhat blunted by the ending).  The animation is gorgeous, Michael Kamen's score is perfect, and the film beautifully evokes the 1950s.Sadly, poor marketing kept audiences away in droves.  All I can say is, to heck with the box office gross.  Despite Warner's appearant desire to pretend the film never existed, the word is getting around about what a magical film this is, and I have no doubt it will join 'It's a Wonderful Life' as a film which bombed in theatres but became a classic over the years.  See it now, so you can say you discovered it before everyone else did."
"""The Iron Giant"" is the kind of animated film you wish there was more of. It respects the audience's intelligence, it has genuine emotion without resorting to schmaltz, and best of all it balances fantasy (well, science fiction) with believability.  I think Warner Brothers animation has out-Disneyed Disney by adding thoughtful writing to clean, understated animation.  What a concept!The story is deceptively simple: Iron Giant falls from the sky at the dawn of the Space Race and befriends a young boy.  But within that framework we get a double story, one for the grown ups and one for the kids, but the message is essentially the same one: paranoia and violence begets violence. I appreciate very much, as others who have commented, that no one burst into incongruous song and that there were no cutesy animal sidekicks.  I should add that there were no clever yet implausible plot twists, nor were there any stock characters.  The bad guy gets a little overheated, true, but he is never the embodiment of all things evil.  The townspeople are your average small town Americans, not bumpkins.  Mom is, well, mom-ish, caring but neither shrewish nor prone to whimpering outbursts.  And our hero is plucky but not annoyingly precocious.A BIG plus for this film is how well it weds the computer animation to the hand-drawn animation, a feat that the Big Mouse hasn't mastered yet.  Even as recently as ""Tarzan"" it is glaringly apparent what parts are computer graphics and which aren't, and the contrast is very distracting. ""The Iron Giant"" makes a virtue of streamlined animation that draws your eye to the beauty of its color and motion.It was a very VERY distinct and unusual pleasure to be treated to a film such as this.  Give us more . . . please!"
"All too often, ""family films"" are only infantile, simplistic formulas with a few self-referential and pop-culture jokes thrown in to try and keep adults awake.  But then along comes  something like ""The Iron Giant"", which is sophisticated enough to demand respect while maintaining a mythic and pure-hearted tone that actually does appeal to the kid in everybody.""The Iron Giant"" is refreshingly non-Disney in no end of ways.  Characters seem real and chosen to fit the story, instead of being a superficial reshuffling of an old formula.  The animation definitely has its eye-popping moments, but there are also scenes of great wonderment, pathos, and humour that only top-drawer animation can convey.  The Giant itself is a great character, who only becomes MORE interesting as the film continues (another huge break from Disney).  No scene is wasted in this film, either; every set piece, even the really funny ones, helps either to establish the ""world"" of the movie, or to advance the plot.  At no time do you feel that you are merely waiting for the story to crank up again.""The Iron Giant"" is funny, exhilarating, and touching as well.  It's sad to see it failing at the box office, as a blunt reminder that the success of films is often in direct proportion to their publicity budget.  Hopefully, though, word-of-mouth will come to its rescue.  Go see it!  Tell your friends!  Then go again!  (Repeat as necessary.)P.S.  I find myself comparing the Iron Giant character to Martin Donovan's character in ""Amateur"".  If there is anyone else on earth who has seen both films you may wish to entertain the notion yourself."
"After seeing this movie, I was overcome by a strange feeling. I realized that I had found a treasure where I had least expected it. The Iron Giant is intelligent, funny, touching, and visually superb, and should show the world that an animated movie does not need to be A) computer-animated, or B) based on a fairy tale to be successful. One of the best American-made children's movies I have seen in a decade: 8.5/10.0Now, I'm a 17-year-old who is slowly transitioning into the domain of movie buffdom, which basically means that I am watching a stream of movies based on recommendations from friends, critics, and the IMDb Top 250 list. I got this one almost by accident after the local rental place could not find the movie I was really after, choosing it basically on the knowledge that it was the previous project of Brad Bird, director of The Incredibles (a personal favorite). After watching it, I felt like calling up every mother I knew and telling her to have her children (and herself) watch this.The Iron Giant revolves around an adventurous young boy in 1950s small-town America who discovers a gigantic robot out in the woods that has arrived on Earth from goodness-knows-where. He befriends the robot, while trying to keep him safe from a nosy government agent. The story seldom lags, with a series of comical adventures connected by the boy's growing relationship with his friend. This movie is very appealing as entertainment. The voices are well-done, and the scenery is also terrific. Most importantly, though, is the animation, which is a bright spot from this time period. The characters are well-drawn, especially the Giant, who through terrific design, lifelike movements, and clever small touches (i.e., the eyes) seems both alien and human, imposing and childlike. Furthermore, the animation is comical. I don't know when I have ever seen slapstick or punchlines so well-complimented by the animation. The script, written by Bird and based off the book The Iron Man, is also very well done. Though the movie relies upon a few minor crutches common to children's movies, it is still very original and clever.One thing that I must point out about this movie is its morals. Throughout the movie, the main moral of the story, about the Iron Giant learning and choosing to be good, is actually fairly adroitly handled. At no point when the subject comes up, including standard sentimental climax, does the idea seem contrived. Throughout the movie, evidence of Bird's influence by comic books is quite evident, and his ultimate message about heroes (variations of which will resurface in The Incredibles) is relevant and sincere. However, I do have to say that the secondary moral, about the evils of xenophobia and paranoia, both of which are embodied by the movie's antagonist, the government agent and the military, are very politically charged. While this may sound initially controversial and politically charged for a kids' movie (the second of which I do not deny), I noticed that it was in large part a thoughtful spoof of Cold War America, with jokes as well as valuable lessons about ""duck and cover"" and 1950s nuclear edginess that I found very clever.On a final note, I do have to point out that this movie had me laughing hard, but more importantly, it brought me closer to tears than any animated movie I can remember (including Bambi), closer than I like to admit. I wish that I had discovered it sooner, and I hope that everyone gets the chance to experience it the way I did."
"What a GREAT movie! Not just for kids, but adults as well. Kids will love it on one level, and adults will love it on another level. Even adults who are not parents will love it!There's humor, there's action, there's nostalgia, there's the perfect capture of being a child, there are positive messages (be yourself, don't kill, etc.), there's satire, there are adults who are not stupid and not comic relief....there's GREAT WRITING!AND NO SONG AND DANCE NUMBERS! Also, there are NO COMIC-RELIEF ANIMAL SIDEKICKS! Take that, Disney! I know some people might be resisting this movie, because it looks like it's aimed for kids - and they might be expecting a Disney clone (and we all know the bad results of Disney wannabes).....but TRUST ME. Give this movie a chance - you'll love it!Is there ANYTHING wrong with it? Well, the only thing that bugged me (just a little) were some close-ups of the characters - these certain close-ups had a ""sketchy"" look a la the movies ""We're Back!"" and ""Balto"".Fortunately, there's very little of this. Other than that - this is a PERFECT MOVIE!"
"Animated movies have long been considered strictly for children.  The old Disney classics that started it all are indeed aimed at kids, but are still very watchable, even for adults.  With the advent of TOY STORY and its countless mimics,  animated feature films have taken long strides to be considered worthy of serious attention.  THE IRON GIANT is just such an animated piece.  The 87 minute wonder is, to put it mildly, incredible. Everything about it is good.  I've also never seen so many influences and references in an animated film before.This is a movie with a heart the size of the title character.  A gentle, gigantic robot is rocketed to earth and befriends a 10 year old boy.  The kid has a single mother (voiced nicely by Jennifer Aniston) and he is just looking for a friend, whether it be a squirrel, or even a 50 foot tall machine.  The familiar premise is obviously out of Spielberg's E.T.  One scene even has the giant reaching out his finger to the boy in much the same way ET did to 10 year old Elliott when he departed this earth.  E.T. was an out of this world fantasy that took place on this earth.  Here, it is animated and almost just as effective.IRON GIANT takes place during 1957 in a small town in Maine.  The 1950's was a time when the American public was fearful of atomic bombs and the possibility of alien life off the earth.  Live-action sci-fi films of the 1950's always depicted the arrival of ""dangerous"" alien life and our efforts to destroy it.  THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is an influence on this film for evident reasons.  Ultimately, the characters in that classic learn from the extra-terrestrial being and realize the dangers of the A-Bomb.  It is amazing to see an animated feature which can relay this same type of message some 50 years later.A beautiful and touching ode to BAMBI is witnessed about halfway through. It also brings back some tearful moments from the key scene in that great, hand-drawn film.  Here, we see both hand-drawn imagery coupled with a computer-generated ""iron giant"".  The title character is actually a 3D composition done digitally, mixed with the 2D action surrounding him.  There are some highly imaginative shots of the robot mixing in with the film's environment.  At one point, he appears to be a lighthouse until the lights begin to blink.  I guess robots must blink too.  Enough analysis.  I loved this movie.  It is ranked #81 on the top list by other user authors for a reason.  Not only is it escapist, fantastic entertainment for kids, adults, and seniors alike, it is an animated picture like no other.  It combines the joy of SNOW WHITE and PINOCCHIO, the commentary of 1950's science fiction, and the wizardry and laughter of TOY STORY and its sequel.  Do not miss this enchanting flick.RATING: ****"
"Hmmm, what to say...well....  it was really good.  I've seen it several times, and I've enjoyed it immensely each time for different reasons.
Analytically I find the animation incredible.  The characters are extremely alive and quite realistic, not because of incredible drawing, well, actually, yes: the way the characters are drawn, and animated, is incredible.  From the jerking, swaying and swooshing of body parts to the magnificent and CONSISTENT use of eyes, eyebrows and cheekbones to show real emotions, it's definite that this movie is a masterpiece in terms of animation.  The backgrounds are wonderfully lush, and evoke a wonderful sense of everything that shows fall for the beautiful season it is.  I love animation, and I love good looking landscapes, so the artists behind this movie are making a fan out of me very quickly.I admire (analytically) most of all the enormous apparance of little details in the film: the season sublty changes from fall to winter; the characters are always doing something, even if they aren't directly in focus (the best ad-libbing a director could dream of); I also think in some parts of the movie the little details actually become crucial to the movie's strength and validity (the time and setting of the story help it to make more sense, also, the ""duck and cover"" scene)You know, I think it's amazing when sometimes a movie can move you so much, talking about it's good qualities seems like child's play.  This is the kind of movie that you can watch over and over and take a long time to get sick of. We all have movies like that, very few can do that to us, but we have them. I'm realising as I write that I like this movie very much, because I've written two or three paragraphs and have not even started talking about the iron giant yet.The animation and expression of emotion in the giant, who is a computer graphics animated character, a hundred feet tall and with a certain old time sci fi persona to him, equals and even surpasses it's traditionally animated companions.  There were scenes in the movie that the giant almost made me cry because of his expressions.  The director, Brad Bird I think, should earn good credit for his work bringing the giant to life.  The giant was very organic and fluid, always animated and extremely alive, without really trying to be. After a while it obvious he's not your average rigid robot.It's hard not to give away details when you write a lot, but thankfully I haven't really given anything away.  I will say this...the movie is about not prejudging things you are unfamiliar with, big or small, and it's about doing what is right and not using gray areas and politics as an excuse not to do the right thing. The movie explores the strange concept of finding friendship, love, and innocence inbetween past guilts and prejudices. It is one of the most well rounded, enriching, thought provoking movies I have seen in my lifetime, and the best part is that it wasn't the visual effects that made me say that...something other feature animation companies have used a a string to lead me on for almost a decade.  I feel like I just recovered from an extended brainwashing experiment.  I've learned my lesson. No longer will movies that use stunning graphics to redeem themselves be an interest to me.  Rather I will watch movies for the messages they give and the depth those movies have. If anything Brad Bird must have tried to make the giant as close in simplicity to the regular animated characters as possible, because you CANNOT tell the difference between CG and traditional in this movie.  Exceptional stuff.I can't imagine anyone I know not liking this movie.  I've shown it to a LOT of people, college students mostly, of all races and religions, with different prides and prejudices, the result, amazingly, always seems to be the same: I have some after movie comments here, and I quote:""Wow!"" ; ""That was NICE!""; ""That was SO...GOOD!"" ;""That giant is crucial, dog!"" ;""It was good...yeah...I liked it!"",; and ""Dang man, that joint TIGHT!"".  If you actually read this review all the way, that's nice. Now forget everything I bumbled about and go see this movie, that way you can spent less time writing your own review than you did reading mine."
"I had heard many great things about the iron giant in the last few years but was one of those films I never got round to seeing. I picked up a copy of the special edition DVD expecting an entertaining animated film. What I actually got was not just one of the best animated films I have seen but one of the best films ever. It takes you to another world but never strays from reality and when watching it you forget it's animated. The characters are so well written it puts most live action films to shame. If you pass this off as a kids film you will be missing out on one of the most immersing and emotional experiences you can get from a film. The voice cast are perfect, the animation stunning and the fact this film flopped when released is nothing short of criminal. I urge anyone even with only a passing interest in cinema to watch this film and prepare to be amazed. Brad Bird must be one of the best directors working in animation and after seeing the incredibles the iron giant was no fluke."
"The Iron Giant is a critically acclaimed piece of animated cinema. I wasn't expecting it to be that good, but The Iron Giant was an amazing movie, it is easily the most exquisite animated movie I have ever seen.Hogarth Hughes (Eli Marenthal) is obsessed by the opportunites offered by science fiction, the possibility of an alien take-over or, at the very least, an attack from outer space. The original story, which the late Poet Laureate had set in England, saw the innocent Titan of the title emerge from the sea; here he is a visitor from another galaxy.The Iron Giant is an amazing piece of animation, the voice-overs were done perfectly, the actors obviously enjoyed themselves, the animated art direction and cinematography was beautiful and the giant itself is just...breathtaking.The Iron Giant is not just another silly little kiddies movie, it is perfection in filmmaking. Please, for the love of God, make your life better and see this brilliant film.I rate The Iron Giant 10 out of 10."
"An ambitious take on Ted Hughes' 1968 children's book The Iron Man, director Brad Bird's The Iron Giant works well as both archetype-infused allegory and heartstring-tugging tale of friendship.  Set in small town Maine in the 1950s at the height of Cold War paranoia, the film explores the relationship between a lonely, fatherless boy (a photo on a nightstand hints that the father was a combat pilot killed in WWII) and a monstrously huge, hulking metal behemoth (the origins of which are brilliantly left to the imagination).  The animation marks a welcome contrast from the virtually ubiquitous Disney template, with the human characters bearing a stylized, comic book exaggeration that fits perfectly with the story material.  The Iron Giant has more than enough imagination and sparkle to interest kids and adults, and nicely balances its action-adventure aspirations with a solidly-crafted sense of moral purpose."
"It's nice to see an elegantly crafted piece of animation come out of America.  How did they manage it?  The writing is great the animation is excellent and the voice acting is superb.  I don't think I've liked an English animated film this much since The Plague Dogs.  The film doesn't talk down to it's audience, and instead tells a simple story very well.  My only complaint would be that Hogarth is somewhat of a smart-alec at times, but I guess this is the era of Leave it To Beaver.Many of the situations are standard movie-fare, the ex-lax in the food, the helmet on the bed, but it's nice to see them in an animated film for a change.  As an anime fan, the realism of the movie didn't impress me as much as the quality of the writing, voice acting, and the music and sound effects.  I particularly remember the sound of the power lines snapping and the musical score building up to the climax of the film.The character design for the giant is excellent, it's amazing how they could draw out very subtle emotions without noticeably distorting the face.  I bawled like a baby near the end.Finally, most importantly for me, there are NO CHEAP LAUGHS in the movie. One of the best moments in the movie for me was when Hogarth is running through the woods and he slams his face into a low branch.  The theater full of kids raised on recent Disney crap bursts into laughter, but wait, there's no stupid sound effect, he's not hopping back up to his feet instantly with a ridiculous lump or distorted face or little birds flying around his head, he's still on the ground ... and what's that coming out of his nose.. it CAN'T BE.. it IS, a trickle of BLOOD.  The kids (and parents) quickly cease their laughter.  I couldn't stop smiling because I knew then that like me, they actually cared about the character on the screen and frankly that doesn't happen very often.Tarzan was a small step in the right direction, and near the end of the long path beginning with that step is The Iron Giant."
"""The Iron Giant"" is simply one of the best animated movies ever made. Brad Bird, the talented man that worked in shows like ""The Simpsons"" and directed the great animated film ""The Incredibles"" is the man responsible for this masterpiece. That man is a genius who is able to turn the simplest stories into gold, having an entire career of very good films. Even his ""Mission Impossible"" film (A franchise which I particularly don't like)managed to be worth-watching.Now ""The Iron Giant"" is one of my favorite films, and it is the best movie directed by Brad Bird, having not only a great animation style, but also a memorable story (Which shows that kid's films could have deep and complex stories)and many intesting characters, The Giant itself is a fascinating creature, which could be easily considered one of the most endearing figures from the entire animation history.Movies like this are enough proof that making a ""children's film"" is not a excuse for a lack of quality. It is for movies like this that I'm a fan of animation."
"The Iron Giant was a beautiful, funny and touching movie, that is one of the best non-Disney animated movies I have seen along with The Prince of Egypt, The Secret of NIMH, Watership Down and Castle of Cagliostro. There wasn't a single thing I hated about the movie, for me it was outstanding on every level. The animation was absolutely gorgeous, with stunning colourful backgrounds and brilliant character animation especially on the Iron Giant himself. The music by Michael Kamen was consistently excellent, and never overpowered the story. In fact at times it even enhanced the drama. And the film has a beautiful message not to mention a sweet story. The characters were delightful, Hogarth isn't annoying at all and the Iron Giant isn't scary in the slightest. Strictly speaking he has to be one of the most gentle and poignant characters in an animated film. There are plenty of effective scenes like the explosive climax and the scene with the dead deer is a real tear jerker. I will admit I was worried initially when I saw the voice cast, but everybody involved did a superb job. Jennifer Aniston and Harry Connick Jnr were perfect, in their most understated performances. Both get stick about being untalented, but for me their vocal contributions in this film suggests otherwise, while Christopher MacDonald almost steals the film as the FBI agent. Eli Marienthal is very sweet and likable as Hogarth too, and watch out for John Mahoney and Cloris Leachman. All in all, an outstanding film, that if you mind me saying so is the best animated film of 1999 and one of the best films of that year too. I may be wrong but I do think it is highly underrated on IMDb. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"Like most reviewers here, I stumbled across The Iron Giant. Frankly, I don't know how I missed it in the theatres, but I picked up a used VHS copy a few years back and fell for it. I recently purchased the DVD version and have rekindled my appreciation for this lovely film.In addition to being a polished gem of a morality play, it is well animated, and well voice-acted. Perhaps Hogarth is portrayed as too obvious a scamp and Kent is too over-the-top in his zeal but the subtlety in the Iron Giant's limited movements and ""vocabulary"" more than make up for it. In any case, this is an animated film - we should expect ""cartoonish"" characters, right? Perhaps it was the total lack of cutesy animals doing Disneyesque song-and-dance numbers, but I found myself noticing the ""acting"" of these characters. Don't worry, I snapped out of it soon enough...Unlike some, I didn't see TIG as a slam against militarism. In fact, the General here (nicely voiced by John Mahoney) shows a considerable amount of balance. Rather, the film is about personal growth and change, respect for life, values, and the bond of friendship. This side of the film works so well that the Giant's utterance of one word - ""Superman"" - toward the end of the film sent me searching for the tissues. (word of advice: keep them handy).Do yourself and your kids and watch this film. Appropriate (IMO) for ages 3 and over (including adults!)."
"Belated review written in 2017.Animation has greatly advanced in the last few decades but nonetheless this entry, at the turn of the millennium, is special.It marked the debut of writer/director Brad Bird, now considered a god in the animation studio.The story is so simple it almost seems unworthy. But in the hands of a master, what you will see is perfection in writing and directing and casting and voice work.Suitable for all ages, will remain a classic for years to come."
"Having to compete with Disney, Dreamworks and Pixar, Warner Brother's animation has never been at the forefront of the animation industry. Apparently all they needed was the brilliant Brad Bird to quell any doubt about their capabilities. The Iron Giant is one of the final films to be presented in the traditional animation form, but even this flick had begun the transition to computer generated visuals. A number of characters, including the giant, were inserted digitally over the hand drawn background, taking special care to perform this imperfectly so as to contrast the rougher backdrop. The finished piece is a visually flawless and captivating film and ranks among the best animated features to ever grace the screen.Brad Bird who began with significant role in The Simpson's cartoon, marks his feature film debut, and would follow up with the even superior films The Incredibles and Ratatouille. The Iron Giant is part political statement, part satire and part family fare, but contains more substance then most children's films, containing passionate and is reminiscent of classics such as ET and The Lion King. Based on the book by Ted Hughes, the tale tells of a young boy in Rockwell, Maine named Hogarth Hughes voiced by unknown Eli Marienthal who, if you must put a face to the voice played Stiffler's younger brother in American Pie, in Cold War era 1958. His mother voiced by Jennifer Aniston, works late shifts at a local diner, his father has been killed (presumably in combat, as we see from a photograph he was a fighter pilot) and Hogarth who has been moved up a grade, finds himself lonely and misunderstood.On a stormy night, a mysterious object crashes off the coast, which to Hogarth's surprise (and everyone's for that matter) is a giant metal eating robot. Finding the creature to be as harmless and confused as a young boy, he befriends the behemoth, stashing him away in a local scrap yard, who the owner (voiced by Harry Connick Jr.) is not especially pleased about. After the giants shenanigans begin to be noticed, a federal agent, brilliantly voiced by Christopher McDonald, comes to investigate ands comes to suspect Hogarth may know something.The scenes where Hogarth attempts to hide the creature are the most hilarious, one sequence after the giant loses his hand (which can walk on its own once severed) our young protagonist attempts to sneak it out of the house. But don't be fooled, the iron Giant is less comedy then it is bold statement, but don't let this turn you off either.Bird's piece is riddled with political commentary on the Cold War and its effect on America and the society's obsession with warfare, weapons and at what cost freedom can be obtained, issues such as morality and death, and explores the human gift of free will, as both a blessing and as a means to do harm. The Giant, despite having every few lines is surprisingly layered and human, and has an innocence covering an inner evil turmoil. The message that you are who you chose to be is reminiscent throughout the whole film, but it never for a second feels preachy. The climax is a thrilling as any action picture, which I will say may be slightly too violent for younger children, and the closing act is as touching as any committed to celluloid.The Iron Giant is a dazzling tale and complex experience which is bound to keep you involved, entertained and will give you something to think about after leaving the theatre. Ranking as one of the best films of 1999, if The Iron Giant marks the end of the reign of the traditional animation style, I say that no finer adieu could be given in this world, or any, dare I say it, beyond this Earth.Read all my reviews at: http://www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com"
"Without a doubt this is my favorite animated movie of all time. I have seen it dozens of times and I still enjoy watching it once or twice a year. I recommend this movie to everyone. It's not just for kids. The animation, editing and soundtrack is amazing. I am a huge fan of Disney movies, but I cannot think of a Disney movie that can touch the Iron Giant on any level. This movie can be enjoyed by kids, parents and non-parents alike. It's not just a great action movie with great writing it will also touch you on an emotional level as well. I have been waiting and watching for a sequel, but I don't think anyone involved in this production intended to do another (even though the ending leaves that wide open). This is the type of movie I wish Hollywood would do more of, instead of re-makes and movies based of TV shows."
"Having been nine in 1957 myself, i appreciate the incredible amount of attention to verisimilitude that this film exhibits -- even the wide turn-ups on Hogarth's jeans, for example.Another thing i was interested by is the fact that we are never told *why* Hogarth's mom is a single parent... but i seem to recall a framed photo somewhere in the house showing a pilot standing by a jet fighter. I knew a couple of kids my age whose dads had never come home from a place called Korea.There are some glitches -- a 1959 Cadillac in a scrapyard in 1957, for instance, or going skinny-dipping in a lake in Maine in late October; and i'm fairly sure that (a) There was no ""Spirit"" comic in publication in 1957 and that (b) the ""Spirit"" comic cover shown is actually a painting ""Spirit"" creator Will Eisner did in the late 70s/early 80s for a reprint series.The references to films of the period -- the sand pit from ""Invaders from Mars"", the tank disintegration for ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" and the animated ""Brain from Planet Arous"" on teevee are neat, too.Looking forward to next Friday's opening of Brad Bird's new film, ""The Incredibles"", though i suspect that ""Iron Giant"" will prove to be the stronger of the two..."
"This certainly ranks as one of the finest examples of cinema in recent pop culture memory. Intelligent, funny, tragic, and deeply moving, we'd be so lucky to ever see an American animated film strike such chords again. The look of the film is superb, and it's underlying themes and messages resonate even more strongly today. Containing a boldly pacifist theme, the film tells a story of a mechanism of war--meant to destroy--that, through the innocence of a little boy, learns to sacrifice in the name of peace and understanding, as apposed to killing in the name of ownership and power. I hope,as years pass, more and more people come to discover this gem so that they can share their experience with the Iron Giant, as well."
"Spoilers herein.I will admit that this is very skilled storytelling: I am really impressed with how singlemindedly every element of this film is coordinated to give a single feel which sustains -- it has to because there is no story development to speak of. So rather than focus on managing evolution of drama, `Iron' focuses on evocation of a single `feel.' And they do that well enough for me. I actually did participate in those duck and cover drills.What I find more interesting is the approach they took to the production of the film, which I find highly self-referential, and which may be the cause of a subtle effect for the viewer. At least I like to think so.The giant is drawn not by a human animator -- instead it is a three-dimensional model created in the computer. The computer then `renders' the 2-D image according to directions. The resulting figure is assembled in a scene that has hand-drawn human characters. In a very real sense, this character of a robot is acted by a robot, while the human characters are `acted' (drawn) by humans.As with all cartoony films, the voices are what you really `see' so far as the drama. But in terms of the images -- which is what all film experiences are about -- what you really see is a conflict among the religions of animators very much like what you see on the screen. That it is set in a pre-computer, but post-nuclear age -- that the lines drawn are not ones of coexistence but of good and evil -- says a lot about Bird's take on all this. A very intimate and effective film on filmmaking. Probably shouldn't be on IMDB's `science fiction' list though."
"No matter what anyone says, It wasn't me blubbering at the end of this movie.  I had something in my eye, was all.  Anyone who testifies differently is a filthy liar.  I thought the movie was okay, you know, if you're like a kid or something, but it didn't touch me at all... *sniff* I have to go now..."
"I have seen many promos with this movie on television, and was curious to see it. Sadly, I didn't, so I guess you can say that I was lazy for not seeing it. No matter, I did see this on HBO and watch this many times as it aired as a 24 hour marathon on Cartoon Network when Warner Bros and Cartoon Network were promoting ""The Powerpuff Girls Movie"" with a music video during the end credits of ""The Iron Giant."" The movie itself feels timeless, and I know this movie will continue to find an audience despite of its failure at the box office when it first came out in theaters. I am more than happy that this movie has a cult following, and there many fans that are embracing it. With that said, ""The Iron Giant"" its about a boy named Hogarth Hughes who lives with his mother Annie a waitress has discovered a giant metallic robot, who fell from space and befriends him. A beatnik artist Dean McCoppin looks out for the Giant at a junkyard, but federal agent Kent Mansley wants to find the Giant and destroy it. The movie is itself is like Steven Spielberg's ""E.T. the Extra Terrestrial,"" but it acts very much its own movie. I continue to love this movie as I watch it, and I see nothing wrong about it. The movie does look gorgeous in widescreen as it gives it a much epic feel to it in a CinemaScope format. As much as we love animated movies in CGI like Pixar or DreamWorks, but I do think its beautiful to see an animated movie to be all done traditionally by hand instead of having it all done by a computer. The animation is again beautiful with all the rich colors, and details that were all put into this movie. I do love how the movie looks as the movie takes place in 1957. The movie does have some funny moments, and I guess a bit edgy for an animated movie that features some curse words. The movie is made for kids, but its something that adults would enjoy. Hey, when I first saw this movie, I didn't expect to hear any curse words in an animated movie which I thought it was going to be a clean animated movie like what Disney did with their animated movies. I guess both Bird and Warner Bros. want it to take it up a notch. The movie is rated PG, and nothing to be worrying about. Or shocking for that matter. I do love the characters, and really love the way they're designed. Also, I thought it had great voice acting. Jennifer Aniston; Harry Connick, Jr.; Eli Marienthal and Christopher McDonald were all really good for their own roles. Vin Diesel, I thought, was perfectly cast for voicing the Iron Giant, and can't imagine any one voicing it aside from Diesel. Michael Kamen's score to the movie is very good, and nothing more that I can say about. I love its story and the direction that the filmmakers went, and I think its perfectly executed. This is Brad Bird's greatest achievement, and should be given a lot of credit for making this wonderful movie. I have heard that Bird and Warner Bros. are both working on bringing this movie for a limited release this year on September the 30th, and October the 4th for remastering it and presenting two new scenes for the movie. This new cut will be called ""The Iron Giant: Signature Edition."" I am very excited about it, and would love to see this on the big screen like I never had before. I love ""The Iron Giant,"" and I am giving this movie a 10 out of 10."
"What an amazing film. I had no idea what a wonderful film this is. I mean, I'm in my mid 30's and a mum of 3. I absolutely love this film. My kids really enjoy it but I don't think they really appreciate the message that it is trying to put across. (well, my 4 year old anyway) My 7 year old just likes it for the bang factor. (the explosions and stuff!) I was a bit disappointed though that the giant didn't have more to say. It would of been nice to know were he came from and why. I had no idea at all that the voice of the giant is Vin Diesel! I would never of thought that he would do anything like this. Just goes to show how many actors are typecast. I got quite tearful at the end, especially when the giant says his last line about being Superman. I mean this is ludicrous! A grown woman crying over what is basically a cartoon!!! Maybe a sequel to this film could happen?If you haven't seen it yet, please make an effort to do so."
I have seen many animated movies in my life from Nightmare Before Christmas and Batman:Mask of the Phantasm to Snow White and the Lion King. The Iron Giant is the best by far not just technically with amazingly beautiful visuals but overall. This movie appeals to people of all ages like no other movie before if you have not seen it go see it. It has something in it for all fans of various movie genres from sci-fi to comedy. It is a shame not many people have seen it. If you can watch this movie and not get hit by a sense of nostalgia or get caught up by the emotional storyline.
"I, unfortunately, didn't get to see this movie until six years after it's release. What a misfortune indeed! This film truly is a masterwork of art, direction, script, and artistic vision. The voice acting is top notch here, Aniston and Harry Connick Jr provide a fabulous and perfectly toned performance. Vin Diesel, even though not saying much, delivers the voice of the Giant with heart, passion and conviction.And I have not yet touched on the humor! There were many parts during this film that had me laughing in hysterics! Bird truly has a knack for making us laugh.Lastly, this movie truly has a message to it that I firmly believe in. Passive to some, obvious to others, the message of The Iron Giant rings true to us all as The Giant gently says ""I am not a gun"".A true tear-jerker in the best way, The Iron Giant is a film of greatness that all should experience and enjoy.10/10"
"The most unfortunate thing about this film was how underrated it was when it came out. To be honest, when I heard about it, I thought the animation looked simplistic and was another straight to video deserving flik.But when I actually got to see it finally on TV it blew me away. Not only was the animation actually an artistic and in a few ways a technical achievement (nicely handled discrete use of CGI), the story and dialogue were far more sophisticated than the usual strand of kid's animation. So much so I became far more intrigued emotionally by the characters and the major plot twists then I have been by many live action movies. The humour was also subdued to short well timed bursts, not completely unbearable like some tripe i've experienced. The story is also told in a way that is logical; characters react accordingly to events and everything happens in a way that can't be questioned and is completely understandable, not overly simplified for the younger audience. Plus the ending was satisfying and a great way to round off an unforgettable experience.It's a shame therefore that such an emotionally vibrant and surprisingly mature animated movie has to be judged on how good it is just by how much cash it rakes in, a dire fate that many a movie has been subject to. 10/10"
"This is the greatest animated movie ever created. It takes state-of-the-art computer graphics, excellent animation, old-school character design, and a compelling and truly modern story. I believe this is based off a book called 'The Iron Giant' or 'The Iron Man' or something. I'm not too sure - never read it.By the production studio _not_ being Disney, it really is a no-holds barred scenario. No cushy wide-eyed animals singing in dewy meadows, or bad guys in epics fights missing every blow almost as it were blatant. No, this movie has an extreme sense of emotion, realism, and feeling I only ever felt in one other animated movie (Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust). The absolute jolt in the `emotional quotient' at the end of this movie is a mental roller coaster, it's a hill you know is there but it 'gets' you every single time.If there is an ""animated movie gauge"" this should be what the rest measure up to.It's a masterpiece."
"Kids see the world differently than adults do, and this movie proves how much of a loss that truly is."
"Taking place seemingly in the 1950's, this film literally has a little something for everyone. It's supposed to be for children, yes, but even older audiences can appreciate a film like this. It has aspects of wonderful science fiction action and adventure. I would say its a somewhat emotional movie as well. The giant is obviously sent to invade the earth and attack humans, but because of the ""bump on his head"", he has forgotten his mission and is, as a child, slowly exploring the world around him and beginning to understand the facts of life. I've seen this film literally about 50 times since I was a kid, to the present day, and I can safely say, even watching it as an adult, that its a wonderful movie for the family of all ages to enjoy together."
"The Iron Giant is a movie that I can watch time and time again and never tire of. This one sits high on a pedestal with The Little Mermaid and Lilo & Stitch as one of my favorite animated features. I am going to skip spoiler warnings here because, well, if you haven't seen this by now, then shame on you.A lone man in a boat in the middle of a terrible storm with hulking waves thrashing him from side to side cries desperately into a radio for help. As he is starting to lose hope, he glances up and spots an illumination in the sky. Saints be praised! It's a lighthouse! A brief moment of rejoicing is quickly extinguished by terror when he realizes that this light is no safe haven, but they eyes of a towering metal man.Miraculously, the man makes it out of this little pickle alive and goes to the local diner where he tells everyone his tale. With guffaws of disbelief, his audience implies that what the man saw came from the bottom of a bottle, if you catch my meaning.At a nearby table, a wide-eyed Hogarth Hughes (Eli Marienthal) is listening to the man's story. Also listening in is Dean McCoppin who is voiced by Harry Connick Jr. He peeks over the wall to vouch for the man, only to be laughed at as well.Single mom to Hogarth, Annie Hughes (Jennifer Aniston), is hard at work waiting tables. Hogarth and Dean meet and are fast friends. Dean is a cool cat and is always calm and collected. Hogarth has a wild imagination and while he would love to do what his mother asks of him, he manages to do the opposite quite often.Hogarth is home alone that night while mom works late. The curious young man ventures out into the night to investigate suspicious activity and is awestruck to find the same humongous metal man from earlier. Incredibly, Hogarth saves the iron giant from doom.The following day, Hogarth bikes off to the woods in an attempt to find this new friend. He places a piece of sheet metal, the giant's favorite snack, out as bait. After dozing off, he is awoken by a loud noise. The metal is gone. He turns around to see that he has done what he came to do. Afraid at first, Hogarth runs, but quickly realizes that the iron giant means him no harm.Hogarth must teach his metal friend, voiced by Vin Diesel that guns are bad and that he doesn't have to be one, even though he is equipped with some major fire arms. Without a place to hide him and no food for him to eat, Hogarth takes the iron giant over to Dean's pad. Dean is an artist who deals mostly with large metal sculptures. ""I mean, what am I? A junkman who makes art or an artist who sells junk? You tell me."" So you see, he has lots of metal sitting around. Perfect for snacking.Meanwhile, after reports of spotting the giant, a call is made and fast-talking government agent Kent Mansley (Christopher McDonald) rushes right over to get to the bottom of things. With his initial disbelief, Kent spends his time making quips about the small town. Gems like ""The biggest thing in this town is probably the homecoming queen."" After a close encounter with a car that appears to be bitten in half, Kent catches on to the situation. He knows that Hogarth is hiding the iron giant and won't stop until he is discovered and destroyed.The movie is full of funny and endearing moments. A couple personal favorites include the scene in which Hogarth, Dean, and the iron giant go swimming. When the giant robot does a cannonball into the lake, hilarity ensues. The heart-to-heart scene that Hogarth has with the iron giant about death is also heart-warming. ""Souls don't die."" When eventually the iron giant is discovered by the government, despite Hogarth's best efforts to tell them that he is harmless, Kent insists that they blow him to smithereens anyway. Hogarth tries to get a handle on the situation, but Kent — in a fit of madness — presses the obligatory big red button and launches a bomb that will destroy the giant, the town, and everyone in it.When it seems that all hope is lost, the iron giant bids his buddy Hogarth a fond farewell, shoots off into the sky, and collides with the bomb, saving everyone from certain death.Flash-forward. Annie and Dean are admiring what she says is his best work yet. A sculpture of the iron giant. Hogarth is given the only piece of the giant that was recovered, and is delighted when it lights up and jumps out the window. He knows the iron giant can self-repair and waves goodbye, hoping he'll see the iron giant again someday.Sweet. Funny. Touching. I really can't say enough good about this movie. I double dog dare you to make it through this one with dry eyes.(Search mssilverscreen for more of my reviews)"
"Fantastic family film about an Iron Giant robot that falls from the skies in the late 50's.  A young kid named Hogarth finds a 50 foot tall steel eating 'Iron Giant', after discovering it trapped in a power plant station.  After saving the giants life, the two bond and Hogarth has to figure out how to keep the whole thing a secret, as a nosy government agent arrives in town convinced there's an enemy 'something' created either by the Russians or martians that must be destroyed.This is the perfect animated film, the giant looks great and has a neat personality and a cool sounding voice (like synthesized grinding metal). There's also enough humour to keep things a little on the lighter side.  But the movie shines spectacularly in its portrayl of a 'friendly giant' and a kid who tries to convince the world that he's harmless.  This is a total setup for a very sappy, preachy, and didactic story line, but the film is not like that at all.  It comes out with the ingenious of an aesop fable handled with great simplicity and without being a paint by numbers moral lesson.  Great for kids and even better for adults.Rating 10 out of 10."
"The greatest compliment I could give this film is that I have viewed it twice, as an 11 year in the cinema, and as an 18 year old at home, and enjoyed and loved it on both occasions. It's been said already, but this film really does combine the best of both worlds. It's silly and slapstick enough to make the kids laugh, and has enough subtle and sophisticated humour for the adults too. In fact, the comedy is what makes this film so special. The jokes are consistently excellent, and it's highly unlikely that anyone can keep a straight face throughout. It's funnier than the Disney/Pixar efforts, save Toy Story, and in fact it's better than most comedies you'll see.The characters are great too. Hogarth Hughes ( Eli Mariental) is actually not that annoying for a Hollywood kid. His double-act with the Giant (Vin Diesel) is entertaining and endearing. Halfway through, Beatnik Dean McCoppin (Harry Connick Jnr) is added to the mix, and together it's a highly amusing triumvirate. However, the show, and the best lines, are stolen by FBI agent Ken Mansley (Christopher McDonald). Mansley is the ideal kid's movie villain, just bumbling and stupid enough to be humorous, but with enough menace to get by. His interrogation of Hogarth itself is chilling, as is his hate of the giant, demonstrated during the finale. The other character of note is Hogarth's mum, Annie (Jennifer Aniston). She isn't a prominent part of the story, which is strange given that Aniston is the biggest name in the cast list. But thankfully, she doesn't wreck the film either.The film is at it's weakest when it's trying to be profound, and there are certainly a few cheesy lines as a result. However the film carries a decent anti-war message, as well as preaching acceptance to those who are different, which is to be applauded in a kid's film. In particular, the Giant's initial refusal to allow himself to become the weapon he was designed to be is well done. Even better is his subsequent rage and rampage at Hogarth's apparent death at the hands of the army, which shows us we can all go off the deep end sometimes. That's pretty deep for a U-rated picture.Other things to note are the animation, which is excellent, different from the Pixar style, but impressive nonetheless. The 50's soundtrack is great too, adding authenticity.In conclusion this is a film that really punches above it's weight, providing great comedy and a decent message that anyone of any age can enjoy. It's said often, but this really is a film that the whole family CAN enjoy. Highly recommended."
"I finally took the time to see writer/director Brad Bird's first foray into feature length film with The Iron Giant. Hearing how great of a film it was and the success of his Pixar debut The Incredibles, I've been seeing the movie on my shelf for a while now, just waiting to finally be viewed. If you thought his last movie had heart, you need to see this one. While being based on a book, I'm not sure if it is the original source material or Bird's vision on screen, but the parallels to King Kong are unmistakable. This creature from another world instills fear into all but one personone person who can see beneath the harsh exterior into the wealth of feelings and compassion bottled up within. Sure the beauty in a story like King Kong is the sacrifice he makes in order to keep his love safe at the unfortunate price of being a monster in the eyes of everyone else, but here we have a kid's story where happy endings aren't just a commonality but a necessity. Bird handles the subject matter nicely at the end in order to give the audience the same emotional attachment to the creature despite the fact that the general population does end up seeing him for what he truly is. Ala Superman/Spider-Man/ etc, the monster mystic soon dissolves as they begin saving human lives.A big part of The Iron Giant's success is the gorgeous animation. This may be one of the last great 2D animated films before CGI took over the field. The cinematic touches are great, including a depth of field composed of blurred images to give the audience a focal point. You forgive that the blurring effect renders the object even flatter than the medium does originally because the effect works as it would in a live-action film. Also, the lighting effects are wonderful, especially the flashlight sequences. When our young protagonist looks out his window into the woods, and the light flare goes from bright blind spot to illuminating band of vision, it looks very realistic. The power of the light even dissipates as the flash goes farther out into the distance. As with The Incredibles, though, the true heart of the film is in the fully fleshed out characters. There is not an overabundance of cluttered supporting roles, but instead a few main roles, which are allowed to evolve and grow an attachment from the viewers. The emotion etched into the movement and facial ticks of the Giant are spectacular at getting language across, much as would have been done in a silent film. Eli Marienthal does a great job as young Hogarth Hughes, the only one who believes that his new friend is more than a weapon. Christopher McDonald adds some nice comic relief as our only villainous role, albeit not a bad guy in the common use of the term, and Jennifer Aniston allows Mrs. Hughes to be both motherly and understanding of her son's adventures. The vocal star ends up being Harry Connick Jr., who is fantastic as Hogarth's friend and confidant when it comes to the new discovery of the Giant. I think the best compliment that a film like this can have is the fact that the vocal talent was so good I didn't recognize any as the people they are in real life. No one tried to infuse their own shtick into the part, but instead played the roles to enhance the story being told.Along with all that, we are treated to subtle commentary on the state of the government, both with the ""duck and cover"" absurdity of atomic warfare and the references to gun control and war. These jabs are just that though, small moments that go along with the story, rather than take it over and hijack the film like what happened with Happy Feet this year. Weighty issues can be addressed in children films successfully, making the audience understand the problem yet not shoving it down their throats when the real issue at hand is the relationship between a child and his new otherworldly friend, giving him the confidence to stand up for himself and be a hero.So far Bird has really impressed me as an animation director. While the teaser for Pixar's new Ratatouille left me a bit indifferent, just the attachment of this autuer's name makes me that much more excited for the movie. Hopefully Bird can keep the track record intact and also, maybe prove that in order for these films to be successful, a good story is necessary. In an age where we get around ten animated films a year, there are many that are horrible cashcows to rip off unsuspecting parents into taking the children to a cartoon. Thankfully Brad Bird shows us that animated films can still hold up against live action ones for the pieces of art they should aspire to be."
"The Iron Giant is one of the best movies I have ever seen, if not THE BEST--all genres considered. My 3 yr old son absolutely adores it, and watches it about 3 times a day. Therefore I watch it about 3 times a day, and I can tell you honestly, I never get tired of seeing it, even after the 75 times I've watched it so far. Every time I still laugh out loud, and tears swell in my eyes. My husband actually introduced us to it, as he loves it as well. Not surprising; it is one of the best written, most touching movies I have had the pleasure of watching over...and over...and over.I don't know why this didn't do well at the box office. Too inconsequential for the public I guess, most likely passed off as another Disney rip-off. There are no cheap tears here, or cheesy gags of any kind. This movie is the real thing. Just take a look at the robots for sale on Ebay (I was going to buy one for my son but $200 is a bit pricey) People are finally realizing how wonderful this film is and it is slowly becoming a cult classic. Buy it up while you can still find it!"
"Just watched this movie again on DVD with my 4- and 6-year-old boys. Truly this is a great movie for raising all sorts of moral, ethical, and religious issues with youngsters.Which leads me to the reason for this post:  To respond to the many viewers who are obviously concerned about the ""negative"" portrayal of guns as being ""heavyhanded"" or ""politically correct.""Several of these viewers quite accurately point out that the depiction of guns is uniformly appropriate.  Guns *do* kill, after all, and no one should be shocked to see a hunting rifle used to kill a deer (the hunters themselves are not in the least negatively characterized) or military weapons used in combat (and again, the uniformed military - in contrast to Kent Mansley - are depicted quite positively and professionally).  Even Hogarth's numerous toy guns are given realistic treatment.Regardless of your position on hunting, gun ownership, foreign policy, or whatever, please don't miss the opportunity to use this movie to discuss these issues with your children in context.  The Iron Giant, after all, is himself a (the?) super-gun -- that's the whole point of the movie.  It's not the gun itself that's good or bad, but the use to which it's put.  Guns don't represent evil in the movie, they represent power.  And each one of us has in us the power to do great good or great harm, within our families, our workplaces, our communities, and so on.  Teach your child to recognize his or her own powers and understand that he or she has the freewill to choose how they are used.  Teach your child to be Superman.And of course, like other posters, you will find political and religious themes in the movie, or any number of other things.I'll say it again -- what a great movie for kids to see.  Please don't automatically conclude its message is simply ""anti-gun"" just because guns are depicted being used as intended."
"You will just have to take my word on this.  You have to see this movie. Animation fans will be blown away by the cool '50s look, everyone will enjoy the great story, funny lines (harry connick jr is superb) and kids will love the giant, his antics, and how he saves the day.  Even i cheered the end, and im 26.  I used to work in a video shop, and when i recommended this to parents, they looked at me blankly (""it aint Disney, it can't be that good"") but i forced them to take it, and when they brought it back (several days late most of them) they thanked me. Not only did the kids love it, they could not stay away either. Proof enough, now go, rent it. Go on, you know you want to. 10 out of 10."
"This is a movie that has something that lacks in almost every single movie in the last five years, and that´s heart. Hogarth is a kid, a kid like you would imagine your grandfather was, from a long forgotten past and is suddenly playing in your tv. He has no barriers, because his imagination can take him anywhere... And the same goes for Brad Bird, the director of this animation epic that can thrill you, like in the confrontation between the Giant and the Army or touch you deep inside your heart... There is no way someone can keep their eyes dry or a smile from showing in the face in the ending, when we see that the sacrifice that one robot did for humankind wasn´t without it´s reward.BEST MOVIE EVER MADE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"WB certainly took some risks here.  An animated flick with no musical numbers, no cute little animal sidekicks, blood, and a couple ""damn""s, ""hell""s and even a ""screw""?  Overall, I think it worked fairly well.  Nice animation, retro-design characters, simple but sophisticated plot, and just the right touch of visual humor, e.g. the robot mimicking the child's postures, the detached hand running amok through the house, etc.  Ignore the preachy anti-gun message (which was, by the way, lost on the younger kids in the audience - my four year old thought the iron giant was cool because ""he had all those guns that could blow up tanks""), and you have yourself one very entertaining movie.  Maybe they could have made the moral more reasonable, i.e. ""gun's can be good if used defensively"", but I guess that would have (** spoiler alert!! **) made the ending far less dramatic -  a blast from one of the robot's lasers would probably have sufficed.I saw ""Iron Giant"" a few weeks after release, and the theater was, sadly, almost empty.  Word-of-mouth and critic reviews have been very good, so I guess we would have to chalk it up to poor marketing.  Hope this doesn't sour Hollywood on an alternative to the standard Disney formula.Its no ""Beauty and the Beast"", but I would still give it a solid 7.5/10. Runs circles around any non-Disney animation I have seen yet."
"Based on the poem 'The Iron Man' by Ted Hughes, Brad Bird's first feature length movie, The Iron Giant, tells the story of a huge alien robot who crashes to Earth, where he is befriended by a young boy named Hogarth, but also pursued by a paranoid US government agent.Hogarth proceeds to teach his newfound metal pal about the wonders of life, the tragedy of death, the difference between good and evil, the joys of dive-bombing into water, and the all important moral 'we are who we choose to be'. However, when the boy innocently aims his toy gun at the massive mechanoid, the robot's true purpose is revealed: he is a walking array of extraterrestrial fire-power programmed to respond to aggression. And with the army on its way to apprehend the giant, it looks like the proverbial is about to hit the fan.Will the robot destroy his enemy with a series of high powered energy blasts from his in-built armoury? Or will he choose to fight his basic programming and become a hero?Featuring breath-taking CGI-enhanced animation, flawless direction, and a script that brilliantly and intelligently mixes comedy, action and drama in equal doses, The Iron Giant is an unmissable treat for all ages.In true kids' movie tradition, the story has several important messages to tell and a couple of tear-jerker scenes, but it thankfully never resorts to the heavy-handed moralising and saccharine sweet schmaltz of many an animated feature. Instead, Bird delicately handles his themes of anti-violence, freedom of choice, life and death, and sacrifice for those you love. And he does this without once feeling the need for a song and dance number. Nice one, Brad!The film also succeeds in feeling very 'real', despite its fantastical premise. This is undoubtedly down to the well developed and likable characters (brilliantly voiced by a talented cast) and the incredible attention to detail in the animation, which not only includes loads of authentic 50s design, but also throws in some great references to the sci-fi movies and comics of the time.If the majority of animated features of the past few years have left you less than impressed, do yourself a favour and track down The Iron Giant. Charming, exciting, and ultimately uplifting, it's a film that'll leave you grinning from ear to ear."
"This film does great service to the excellent Ted Hughes tale. It is one of the most beautiful animations of recent years. A film that perfectly captures the anti-Soviet paranoia of the 1950s in the atomic age.With DreamWorks also producing interesting stuff like ""The Prince of Egypt"", it shows there is interesting, entertaining non-Disney animation to entertain the family."
"The Iron Giant is one of the few animated movies that isn't directly meant for kids. The film, as a whole, is more between the lines of being mature and young. Being in between these lines is what makes the movie more unique. It had a charm while, at the same time, also had subtly dark moments which children may see as odd but an older audience may understand better. Despite that, it is still a movie that anyone can see and still feel something from it. It's an emotional and charming trip through the friendship of a young boy and a giant robot. It is also Vin Diesel at his finest, despite his role being a giant metal man that can barely speak. Eli Marienthal, who plays Hogarth, also did a fantastic job in portraying a rebellious young boy in 1957. The plot also accurately portrays the concerns regarding the 1950's with the Cold War, as it does mention nuclear weapons a couple times in the film.Overall, I would strongly recommend that this movie be watched. It is one of those films that should be watched within someones lifetime."
"An amazing film. Very inspiring there is no where to begin or end. If you haven't seen this film and have doubts because its animated or because its ""kiddish"" think again. The ending, the middle, the beginning. All a work of art, words cannot describe the satisfaction after seeing this movie. The animation is amazing and there are a few corny jokes here and there. If you're like me, open minded you can really appreciate this movie and how unique it is. This is the kind of movie that leaves you with good feelings. The robot had good intentions and learned over time. Excellent10/10"
"I always read through the IMDb reviews to see if people have the same opinions as me on the films I watch but have never felt the need to add my comments until now.A friend brought the Iron Giant for my 2 kids and advised me that it was a great watch for adults as well, so I popped it into the DVD the other night and sat down to watch.Without giving any of the story away I will just tell you my thoughts after I had watched it. This is the best animation film I have ever seen. I loved Nemo, The Incredibles, Monsters Inc etc, but this film offered so much more in terms of emotional ties. I had tears in my eyes at the end of the film and had to hide my face from the family.It is such a wonderful simple story and I cannot believe it did not get the commercial success it deserved.For any people with kids or without, please give this film a chance and either rent or buy it. This film is what animation was invented for."
"This movie is beyond amazing, It is probably the best animated film ever. It has you weeping one moment, and laughing at the antics of Hogarth and The Iron Giant the next. It is definitely on my list of top ten best movies of all timeThe best scene is near the end when the Iron Giant is flying up in the sky, and he says, ""Superman"" It almost made me weep.If you want to watch an animated movie not just made for kids, and with more heart than most movies out there, this is the one. If more movies were made like this one, more people would see movies in theaters, instead of the crap that comes out of theaters lately, like all of the sequels and comebacks to the theater, like rocky and Rambo."
"Here was a cartoon movie with loads of potential, and even more depth, one that gave children and parents alike a real, emotional story, and on top of that, it didn't treat kids like they were stupid. It's probably Vin Diesel's greatest role (because he doesn't say much, and sometimes less is more).The Iron Giant learns mankind's inhumanity and obsession with irrational fear. The Giant is essentially a war machine, his purpose to conquer and lay waste to entire civilizations. Not unlike Frankenstein, he's ostracized and feared merely for existing. But from friendship he learns mankind's capacity to do good even in the face of impossible danger, and ultimately, sacrifices himself out of love.I liked how we don't get to know where exactly the robot came from, or why it's here. I think that we're supposed to draw our own conclusions when we see strange visitors from the starry sky. And because we naturally fear what we don't understand, we feel the need to destroy it. Because it makes us look at ourselves in the mirror, and question our own purpose and existence. Maybe the things that fall from the heavens are too good for this world."
"Pete Townshend of the Who must have had a good reason to work on this. Watch it and you will see. Every boy wants to be the Hogarth, Every man, to be Dean. Every one wants to hate Kent, and all that that implies.Whether you relate to Hogarth, his mother Annie, the beatnik Dean or the General, you will find a reason to relate to this movie. The stereotypes from the 1950s America are not so blatant as to make this movie stilted. It pulls off the era with the same smooth aplomb as Back to the Future. The staging is professional, the soundtrack excellent. The only tragedy is that they did not go on to make more with this tight production team.Watch with your son, with your father, with your heart."
"A very touching film. It is much better than anything Disney has done for quite some time. It stands up there with any of the Disney classics in my opinion. Great story, wonderful characters, the Iron Giant is amazing!SPOILERS: I had tears in my eyes when we saw that the Iron Giant had survived the bomb and only really powerful movies can do that to me! Watching the parts return to him in Iceland was a powerful scene and perfect ending. The Iron Giant was such a nice and gentle character despite his massive iron body. The relationship between he and Hogarth was perfect. I'm also pleased that the Iron Giant became a hero to the town instead of being driven away, which is what I feared would happen to him."
I really enjoyed the iron giant and wish that Mr Brad Bird would create a sequel for the iron giant!!! Maybe the creators of the iron giant would come looking for him because he hasn't reported back to them about conquering the earth! In the mean time the giant is coming back together and returns to Hogarth's place just in time to confront his creators to try to get them to back off from their pursuit of world domination. Or he could come back in time to prevent another alien race from coming and doing the same to earth. I don't know how or who will write the sequel but I sure wish someone would. I just don't think it should be let go and never heard from again!!!
"This movie grabbed me from beginning to end, and on several levels. Childhood, friendship, love, respect for life, family, this movie moved me in so many ways. It is very funny, and so innocently heart-warming, with a deep message about faith, love, and sacrifice, carefully woven into the story. It is something when an animated film makes you laugh, but when it can make you cry too....that is fantastic. The cinematography is excellent and I felt the subtleties of the music also contributed so much to emotion of this film. Also, the acting was fantastic, there was great depth to all the main characters which made them very real to me. This film can definitely be appreciated by young and old. It is in my personal library."
"The Iron Giant is one of the best animated films of the 1990's. It has everything you could ask for in a movie and it covers some great topics. It covers topics such as cold war tensions, childhood, and it even has an underlying message about anti violence and being yourself. The story follows a gentle robotic giant who befriends a young boy. The giant has no recollection of his origin, or what he was designed for, but the young boy, Hogarth Hughes, tries to teach him about things, similar to how a parent teaches a little kid. At the same time, Hogarth also tries to hide the Giant and protect him from anyone who wants to destroy him. Unfortunately, not everything is well. A shady government agent is bent on trying to find the giant at all costs. The animation is very colorful and very well drawn. The voice talents are all very good. What's interesting to me is how Vin Diesel, who later went on to be in action movies like Fast and the Furious and xXx, was the voice of The Iron Giant before all of that. This movie has a great story, and there is a good message underneath it all. Kids should definitely see this, and adults should too. Even though it looks like a kids movie, adults will be able to get something out of it and enjoy it as well. Another thing this movie pulls off that many cartoons are unable to is to make you feel certain ways. When Hogarth and the giant are playing around and doing fun things, it puts you in a good mood. Later in the movie, when certain things happen to certain characters, you feel the way they feel.Director Brad Bird later went on to make the excellent animated movie, The Incredibles. He has made some good movies, so I hope he can make even more good movies.The Iron Giant is a brilliant animated movie, and as I said before, it has great animation and a great story, along with memorable characters, and a great underlying message. This is easily one of the best animated movies of the 1990's, and it has great elements. There is humor, but smart humor, not mindless fart jokes. There is never a dull moment, or a dumb moment. At certain points, there is action. Normally action at the end of a movie makes it that much more entertaining. It's very rare when you find a cartoon with all of these elements, and when everything works out perfectly. I recommend this for anyone, kids or adults, even teenagers."
"""The Iron Giant"" really is a wonderful movie. It's a different kind of animated movie and although it has some comical moments the main essence of the movie are on the emotions and atmosphere. It can be describes as ""E.T."" with an Iron giant.The movie really perfectly captures the 50's atmosphere. The animations are not really among the best of the last couple of years but they look more than good enough.The story is heartwarming and the ending really is superb!Jennifer Aniston is really good and very believable as a mother but Harry Connick Jr. really was the one who stole the show. His character really is my favorite of the movie and his sense of humor is spot on!Wonderful animated movie and also one with a message. A treat for young and old.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"Since the release of The Little Mermaid in 1989, Walt Disney Pictures has produced a cavalcade of animated masterpiece after animated masterpiece. That movie's success and the subsequent efforts from the same studio ushered in a renaissance of American animation. Megalomaniacal visionary Steve Jobs' belief in a small computer graphics studio, Pixar was directly responsible for the birth of the computer animation feature movie. Their list of accomplishments reads like a who's who and gave impetus to other creative forces to do the same. Since the seminal Toy Story, DreamWorks and Fox, among others, have followed Pixar's lead in that genre of animation. Yet, given Disney's pedigree and Pixar's mastery, one would be incredulous to learn that the best American-made animated movie of the last 20 years was directed by a virtual unknown (at the time) and was distributed (if you can call it that) by Warner Brothers and not any of the aforementioned masters of the art. That movie is the Iron Giant.The story of the Iron Giant is a cross between Beauty and the Beast and ET. It opens in space with a shot of Sputnik panning across the screen and something hurtling from space towards the planet. That something is the title character, a giant robot. Once on earth, the Giant proceeds to dine indiscriminately on the earth's varied cuisine of metal and steel. The Giant is befriended and spared electrocution by a young boy named Hogarth Hughes. The rest of movie tracks the two main characters on their quest to evade detection, have fun, and munch on all the metal that can be had. Along the way, the viewers are treated to a terrific parable about the futility of violence. Set against the backdrop of the early days of the Space Race, the reality of the Cold War helps to contrast the message the movie is sending.The day may be fast approaching where computers and animators can replicate the entire gamut of human emotions and characteristics and render a digital ""actor"" as realistic and compelling as any Academy Award winner. What the computers may not be able to ever do though is replicate the raw emotion that can be discerned from the human voice. In The Iron Giant, the emotions that come to the fore more often are joy, exuberance, and wonder. It is a testament to the actors involved in this feature that the characters are so compelling. Eli Marienthal voices the character of Hogarth with such delight that we can't help but wonder what has gone wrong in our world that we can't feel the same level of enjoyment. The fact that the young Mr. Marienthal is given such tremendous material only helps. Hogarth is an optimistic young man; he thinks the best of everyone and everything and one can't help but wonder if such open-mindedness is as a mechanism erected to keep out the rigors of growing up as a latch-key kid in a single parent home. And, his understanding of death as a part of life makes perfect sense when one considers the fact that this child has been subjected to the ""duck and cover"" instructional in school every year of his short life.If joy and optimism define Hogarth, then wonder defines the Giant. ""Voiced"" by Vin Diesel, the Iron Giant starts off as a enigmatic brute and transforms into an amalgam of childhood, best friend and parental figure. The young thespian gets very few lines of understandable dialog but those that he does get, he delivers with a tenderness that contrasts the mechanical nature of his character.Along with the two protagonists, the rest of the voice work is also excellent. Jennifer Aniston does a good job as Hogarth's single mother, conveying the exasperation a mother must feel when she has to deal with a bright child with an overactive imagination. Harry Connick Jr. is amusing as the beatnik scrap dealer, Dean who Hogarth befriends and who in turn befriends the giant. It goes without say that, given his philosophical tendencies, Dean is the first to accept what Hogarth has to say about the giant's benevolence. Finally, John Mahoney as General Rogard and Christopher McDonald as federal agent, Kent Mansley are also very good. The former comes across as the same sort of caring realist he played in Say Anything without the pen chance for fraud. The latter is positively delicious as a fed that has bought in to all the hype of the Cold War; he is truly drinking the McCarthy Kool Aid. In fact, if he weren't such a despicable guy who does some pretty despicable things, you can almost feel sorry for him.Technically speaking, the Iron Giant pales somewhat when compared to some of the other animated features that are its contemporaries. Even from a traditional animation standpoint, there are contemporaries whose craft stands out more than that of this film. And the main story itself is also simple. What makes this movie terrific is its heart. It gives us characters that we care for, human and otherwise and along the way of the story, it tries to teach it's audience profound lessons on fear and on violence as a solution (or, in this case, non-solution).9 stars out of 10"
"Simply - The Best Traditionally Animated Movie of All Time!As the title of this review states, it's the best. Toy Story 2 and Shrek are my all time #1 CGI movies, but The Iron Giant (which I thought would suck) turned out to be the biggest emotionally affecting 'cartoon' I have ever seen, its even more of a tearjerker than the ending of Monsters Inc.
Beautifully animated and expertly executed, I was in both tears and perched on the edge of my seat for the last twenty minutes. As of writing this review the movie is ranked #235 in the top 250, I strongly agree with its placement among the best movies of all time, but strongly disagree why it's not within the top 100. I have noticed one or two people (mentioning no names) have rated the movie a 1/10 simply because they disagree with its ranking, despite admitting they enjoyed the movie. Henceforth I have voted it a 10/10. Which incidentally is my rating for the movie :)Please just buy the DVD, for a mere £10 or less (or $12 if you are in the US) get this movie. I can't possibly imagine anybody would not like it, it's superb. 10/10 - AN ABSOLUTE CLASSIC!"
This is a beautiful movie. One of Vin Diesel's best performances and unfortunately it has been overlooked by the masses. If the Academy awards had the animated movie category back then I would not be surprised if it would have been nominated. The quality of the animation takes me back to when I was a child watching Bugs Bunny cartoons and it just gives me a warm feeling.
"Spoilers.The Iron Giant is a very interesting movie from the opening scene to the final conflict.  At first I was skeptical after seeing the strange character design and some childish events.But I was impressed with some of the ideas presented in the movie.  The Iron Giant, really a child at heart, is a pretty cool character.  His CGI doesn't fit too well with the other animated scenery, but still interacts rather well.What I didn't like about Iron Giant was some of the ""perfect events"" that seem to plague today's movies.  For instance, a switch on a power plant to turn it on or off?  Come on!  And Hogarth's mother finds the flashlight within seconds of the power going off!  I found things like these kind of annoying.The final climactic moment seems a little out-of-place, since the movie was filled with heart all the way through.  Then the end is filled with military bombardment and attacks, which I found strange.  This action at the end is really cool, however, and I really liked it.Also, I found the ending only partially satisfying.  The movie breaks the traditional ""happy ending"" that American movies constantly have nowadays. The Giant's final sacrifice is amazing.  Here he was, a defensive device with the ability to take out the world if necessary, yet he jumped skyward and into a massive missile to save the inhabitants of a small town.  He isn't really killed, as we find in the end, but I kind of liked this, too, since at the beginning we found out that he was made to fall apart rather than shatter.The plot and story are simple.  Young boy finds giant robot, struggles to keep him out of sight.  Which proves to be obviously difficult and leads to some hilarious twists and turns.The Iron Giant is a really good movie, and I now have a little more respect for Warner Bros.  They've got an adult mindset for a movie that could have been advertised for children.  That seems to happen a lot now.  And it's annoying.  But Iron Giant didn't do this.  It was advertised and made for everybody."
"Iron Giant is a must see for everyone. Simple, heartwarming and inspirational, this film really hits the spot. I do not know ANYONE who hasnt LOVED this film - and if someone doesn't, they are a heartless shell of a human being.In fact, this film is so good that I suggest you just purchase it. If you rent it, you will want to make it a part of your permanant DVD or VHS collection - so save the four buck rental fee and buy it outright.Incidentally, look for a wonderful cameo by Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, two of Disney's original 'Nine Old Men' as two train engineers - they provided the voices and the characters are spitting images of them. A delightful treat for any true animation fan."
"A small spoiler in here.The Iron Giant is the most absolutely amazingly definitely best animated filmplay I have ever seen. It is just perfect, you must see it yourself. At the time of writing it is showing on Sky. It combines humour with drama, and deals with the problems experienced by young teenagers as situational euphemisms i.e. one actually expressed in the film compares the giant, a metal creature of gigantic proportions, as a little child lost within a supermarket. This complies with everything I've written.If you haven't seen this film, even if you are of late teenager years like me, you will love it. It have received a lot of skeptical looks when mentioning this to schoolfriends, but I don't really care. It's their loss.The only comment I have against the film is the ending. It seems out of place. Comparing it to the life support machine starting to bleep after some time is a possibility, but this is (in most cases) a good thing. I reckon that it is good that a child should see that all good things come to an end (like the film), and that nothing lives for ever, not even giant metal monsters. That doesn't stop me awarding it 10 out of 10 though.Great voice acting, though the movie is always introduced hyping Jennifer Aniston, as though she is a 'special guest ""appearance""'. This is wrong - she is as good as the rest of the cast, no more. Why isn't Eli Marienthal higher in the cast list?"
"An enjoyable and inspiring animated film for all ages. This modern fairytale is a story of a great friendship - that of a lively yet warm-hearted boy and a 50 foot iron robot with some very human qualities.In 1950s America, post-war suspicion and paranoia give rise to a fear of all things different. A huge robot from outer space is seen as the ultimate threat. Yet one perceptive child discovers that the Iron Giant has the ability to combine superhuman powers with the best qualities of human nature. With the encouragement of his young friend, the gentle giant discovers his soul and learns about trust, friendship and respect for life. But will his true dark purpose lead to the destruction of all he has come to love? Is the power of friendship strong enough to save him not only from the prejudice of others but also from himself?This intelligent and moving film has much to offer to anyone who can put their own prejudices against `cartoons' and `kids films' aside. While being good fun for children, The Iron Giant has a depth that adults will appreciate. This is a more `grown-up' kind of animation - no singing and dancing animals and attention-stealing backdrops, no caricature sidekicks or too bad to be true villains; instead we are treated to a fully developed characterisation rarely seen in feature animations. The result is a small cast of believable and engaging characters who draw you into what could have been a predictable plot and who leave you caring about what happens to them. The story is by turns amusing, touching, dark and inspiring. The animation is clever and seamless, but understated, letting the wonderful characters take centre-stage.A talented cast breathe life into the characters, without turning them simply into animated versions of themselves - unlike some  actors in rival films. Hogarth Hughes, the boy who befriends the giant, is given a spirited and natural performance by young X. The powerful voice of Vin Diesel, by turns frightening, funny and heartbreakingly emotional, gives the mysterious yet lovable giant his soul. Jennifer Aniston is utterly convincing as Hogarth's mother Annie - a hardworking single mother desperately trying to be a responsible parent to her imaginative, energetic son, yet secretly in need of some magic in her own life. Harry Connick Jr. gives warmth and humanity to trendy beatnik Dean, a scrap-metal yard owner who turns junk into `art' and works hard at seeming a cool laid-back kind of guy, but hides behind the smooth exterior a caring, fun-loving personality who needs others more than he would admit.  Y is the villain of the story, as Kent -, the government official on a quest to destroy the `monster'. Driven by fear, misunderstanding and most of all the opportunity for self-advancement, Kent poses a real threat yet is also amusing and thoroughly believable. It is this thoughtful characterisation that makes the film so special - there are no extremes of good and evil, simply characters not very different from us, with a range of emotion and the potential to become what they choose. The films message, `You are what you choose to be,' reflects not only the inner struggle of the Iron Giant between the desire to do good and the instinct to destory, but the struggle inside of us all to be the best that we can.I was pleased and not at all surprised to see this animation voted number one in the Children's category on IMDb (April 2000). Kids will love it, and will maybe learn from it's message of non-violence and shaping your own destiny. But, whether you have children or not, I highly recommend this heart-warming and intelligent film. It is so much more than just another feature animation. In The Iron Giant, Warner Bros. has succeeded in avoiding the all too common pitfall of turning an animation into a poor imitation of Disney. They have instead combined their talents to produce a deeper, more intelligent story with a magic that is completely their own."
"I'm so glad that I finally found this masterpiece five year after this movie has been released. This is a really great movie and in my opinion it's one of the best animated movies ever made. I think the biggest flaw of the Disney animation is the complete lack of human characters. Disney and now Dreamworks made movies about fishes, sharks, bears, lions, dogs, bugs, ants, toys, superheroes and many other animals and creatures but you can hardly find single movie with human character from a real life . Well, all their characters can talk, feel and behave like humans but it is not the same. Most of their recent movies were good, funny and entertained but at the same time they look a bit childish and not so emotional, even cold. They are typical commercial stuff and with strong marketing studios often get good box office returns. The Iron Giant is a different case. This is a very intelligent, good-feeling and enjoyable animation with powerful and clever moral messages in its core. At first sight it looks like a kids movie but it's a wonderful movie both for kids and adults. In fact the movie idea could have been unnoticed for small kids. The story happens in 1957 in small town in Maine. It was a years of the cold war and military paranoia, a period of total fear and misunderstanding from both sides. It was really amazing to watch how brilliant was recreated the atmosphere of that period. All begins than the Hogarth, a young fatherless lonely boy found near his home mysterious Iron Giant. I think it was s a clever idea what we'll never know where this giant come from. Different and unknown doesn't always mean bad and enemy. Hogarth helped him and they become friends. He gave Iron Giant some moral lessons and even taught a basic English. But when in the town comes paranoiac special agent Kent Mansley they friendship now is in a danger. He wants to kill the Giant without any reasonable reason, just because he think what this strange robotic Iron Giant can be dangerous. Most surprising and intelligent element in the story was the fact that this movie didn't become a cheesy childish anti-gun propaganda. The message is more wise and intellectual. As Hogarth said we are what you we choose to be. Our acts are always our individual decisions and some things can't be simply bad or good, and only our choice can decide how we can use them. Also you can find in this movie many other strong philosophical ideas and thoughts. Overall, the story of friendship between young boy and The Iron Giant is very touching and emotional. Now about animation. It was absolutely fabulous. All movie is an amazing work of art. The Hogarth character so perfectly drown that you can easily forget that it's an animated movie. He looks like a real, well acted boy. I have seen almost all famous animated movies and I suppose he is a best animated character I have ever seen. The rest of main characters also very impressive, landscapes, sky and all minor details like ships and tanks were beautiful and looked absolutely real. The Iron Giant was the only computer-generated character and he didn't look as a soulless machine. He becomes a very warm and likable character. With excellent characters development and interesting story The Iron Giant is an extraordinary intelligent movie. Sometimes it's funny, sometimes it's sad but it's always enjoyable, touching and entertained movie. If you haven't seen it before just go and buy, rent or borrow it. I recommend The Iron Giant to all people irrespective of their age. A solid ten. Thanks for reading and sorry for my bad English."
"It's the 1950s and young Hogarth Hughes happens upon a visitor from space.....in the form of a giant iron man.Delightful animation adaptation of Ted Hughes' much beloved 1968 novel The Iron Man. Set during the period of time when Cold War and sci-fi paranoia was prevalent, The Iron Giant embraces these themes and stokes them with lessons of friendship, hatred, death and pertinent reminders of pacifism. Directed by Brad Bird and scripted Tim McCanilies and Andy Brent Forrester, The Iron Giant is one of those rare animation animals that delights the kids as much as it does the watching adults. Tho the actual giant himself, with all his dazzling weaponry, is the star attraction on show, it's the iron colossus' inner conflict that gives the film its heart. Aided by his friend, young Hogarth, good old iron decides he doesn't want to be a big weapon, but the authorities, as is nearly always the way, just can't let it be. The unflinching attitude that ran thru many of the 50s sci-fi schlockers was one of being-""because we don't understand it, lets destroy it""-something that Ted Hughes and the film makers here capture perfectly. Sophisticated and intelligent in its approach and delivery, this is definitely one of the better animated film's from the modern age. 9/10Voice work comes from Jennifer Anniston, Harry Connick Jr, Vin Diesel, James Gammon, Christopher McDonald, M. Emmet Walsh and Eli Marienthal."
"Back in 1999, when ""The Iron Giant"" was first released, several friends of mine, aware of my love for 1950s sci-fi films, urged me to go see this movie. For some reason, I passed. A few years later, another friend's 4-year-old son told me what a great video this was, but I still declined to watch it. And even later, when my own nephew (then 6) told me what a hilarious scene he'd just witnessed in ""The Iron Giant"" (the one in which young Hogarth drinks espresso and starts talking a mile a minute)...well, even then, I still ignored the advice. Anyway, all the above folk will be happy to hear that I finally DID watch this animated sci-fi film last night, and found it absolutely charming. Featuring wonderful animation, nice touches of warmth and humor, and wry commentary on '50s paranoia and A-bomb lunacy, the film really does have appeal to young and old. Lovers of sci-fi and/or action films should especially enjoy the film's latter scenes, in which the lovable Giant gets ticked off and morphs into an unstoppable killing machine. My hat is certainly off to everyone involved in the making of this most entertaining film. And this ""special edition"" DVD, filled with more extras than you can imagine, certainly does live up to the advertising. Hmmm...maybe I SHOULD take my nephew's advice and finally rent out his favorite movie, ""Toy Story 2""..."
"This ran a big risk of going horribly wrong, but Brad Bird shows in his first feature that he knows how craft a new whole out of genre parts, while keeping his eye on the big picture. The opposite of this movie would be the execrable ""Independence Day"", where the whole decidedly was a good deal less than the sum of the pieces.Part of his crafting solution is to take a story set in the past, that's about the past, and keeping the feel of the visual and vocal expression in the past -- no referential pop-culture hokum. Obviously, this is composed from parts of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"", ""E.T."", ""Terminator 2"", ""Godzilla"" and countless 50's B movies. What matters is that this is smarter than all those put together. The way this shatters old perspectives is placed directly in the visual narrative -- the part where the kid watches the brainlessly stupid movie about the man-eating brain -- all intended to point out the superior intelligence of what we have here.Secondly, the use of the Giant's exaggerated height gives Bird the advantage of exaggerating the perspective of the 'camera'. He gets to play with focus and composition -- this is superbly detailed from every angle and in every trajectory...Anime without the losses in translation."
"This is perhaps the best animated movie I've ever seen. Iron Giant is a no name robot who's origin and purpose for creation is unknown, but is surprisingly innocent and powerful. It has a sense of purpose and has loyalty and decency we don't even see in ourselves until it is provoked and shows what it might have been created for - weapon of mass destruction. Who created the Iron Giant with its heart of gold and body as indestructible weaponry ? Was it part of an unknown robot army from another planet that got strayed from its squadron ? The story leaves lots of plot holes that beckons us to know more about this character. Would the writer of this story do a sequel that fills in all the gap in the robot's back ground, and help us look deeper into its character ? It seems to be one of the best character to come along in many years. Although the scope and the period setting is similar to ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" this animated character is much more lively, and thought provoking."
"Having being a great fan of the Iron Man i was cynical about this movie i have to admit. It does make changes to the original story but this creates a separate tale which can stand on its own. Its very entertaining, with jokes for kids and adults. Featuring excellent voice acting, a strong plot with good pacing. The animation, using the more traditional approach, is impressive and most importantly adds to the story instead of becoming the story. The ending will make you get that tingly feeling that I believe tells you that the emotional story is effective. If you are a fan of the book you have nothing to lose, if you like the story, you win and if you don't well the book's still there. Oh and its Vin Diesel's best film to date."
"One of the rare movies that I loved, my 6 year old loved, my 9 year old loved and we all want to see it again and again...no boring songs and dance! This is on my top ten list right along with Spirited Away and Monsters Inc."
"Warner Brothers' only previous half-way decent full-length animated film was [Space Jam - a animation / live-action mix that saw Warners' greatest stars (Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, etc.) team up with the world's highest-paid sports superstar Michael Jordan to entertaining though easily criticisable effect. Aside from this their efforts have been somewhat useless. Content for a long time to release other peoples animated movies such as [Thumbelina] and [The Pebble and the Penguin] (go on, have you seen them?) they decided, on the strength of [Space Jam]'s success, to reopen their famous theatrical animation department in the hope that they could recreate the legendary success of their 50's short cartoons with full-length animated features. Their first effort, [The Magic Sword: Quest for Camelot], boasted as many words in the title as there were famous names in the voice cast but, sadly, boasted almost nothing else. Except that there were almost as many words in the title as there were people who went to the cinema to see it. So, it is somewhat of a surprise to find Warner Brother's Feature Animation department releasing this upon an unsuspecting movie world, for this is the finest animated feature-length film to be released that has nothing to do with the mighty Disney studios (as of February 2000 and, it should be noted, that the key animators on this movie are all ex-Disney). Forget DreamWorks' glossy but botched [Prince of Egypt], forget Steven Spielberg's over-rated executive-produced [An American Tail], forget the excellent [Antz], forget even [Toy Story] and [Toy Story 2] (both co-financed and released by Disney anyway). The Iron Giant is cinema's finest non-Disney animated feature length film. It is a real shame that so few people saw it. Here's hoping that the home video market will discover this real gem."
"I've just watched this film for probably the fifth time, and I must say it rates as one of the best animated films of all time. It's truly heart-warming and something you don't often find in animated features: it's REAL. The characters are actually believable. The film boasts rich and vibrant artwork. Its message is simple, yet effective. Warner Bros. should be ashamed it didn't put any effort in promoting The Iron Giant when it came out in '99. This rivals anything Disney has put out -- without the annoying show tunes. Easily 10 out of 10."
"This movie was so good, i cried in a lot of parts but it was still great, i have seen it over 100 times, i never get sick of it, it was such a cute and good movie that taught u about life and stuff like that and it was just great, watch it sometime, its on cartoon network all of the time lately so watch it!!"
"Maybe the best animated film ever.  This movie manages to get right what Hollywood has been trying to do for the last forty years.  I truly don't understand why it didn't cause more of a splash when it first came out. It's great to see it slowly achieve its rightful status as a classic, but why didn't the critics stand on the rooftops and shout about this one?"
"The Iron Giant is a movie I wasn't exactly looking forward to watching- I don't know why- I guess the way the studio's marketed it, it didn't look too appealing. When I finally got a chance to sit down and watch it- I was absolutely blown away. What a beautiful and heart warming story! What an amazingly talented cast of voice actors- (Jennifer Aniston as a working class single mother? who knew!) Along with the animation, and the fun music this makes for a real treat for the whole family! It's a fabulous movie and a joy to behold. Every time I see it's on TV- I usually end up watching the whole thing- This is the kind of magic DISNEY used to make but forgot how to. 10/10 absolutely beautiful- you will not be dissappointed."
"The Iron Giant was one the best movies of 1999 combining great animation with a strong story, that of The Iron Man written by Ted Hughes.The basic plot is that a mysterious robot crashes to Earth from outer space, becomes friends with a small boy and junk-yard owner, learns important issues about life before being discovered by a paranoid army officer who is intent on destroying the giant.This film more than lived up to my expectations, I could hardly find any faults with any aspect. The voice talents are well cast with Vin Diesel doing a great job voicing the giant. The animation of the giant is also good with the last act of the film, when the giant shows a new side, being easily as good as Disney could manage.For me, the film is made by the story and the issues raised, especially the ending which always brings a tear to my eye.All in all, go and rent this film, it not just for kids but for the whole family.10/10"
"But it should have been longer. I distinctly remember an entirely different ending in the book. I also do not remember any 1950's communist paranoia in the book or the character of Hogarth being so young. But the changes do not harm the movie and the ending this film has is just fine. There are obviously no opening credits to the film so guessing the voices is cool fun. But it's impossible to guess who plays the Iron Giant.But the Iron Giant himself is a wonderful hero. It's cool to watch him learn simple things and having him eat cars is a neat little characteristic. I like when he's bored and he plays with the hood with one of the cars in the junkyard. You cannot dislike the Iron Giant.I think it was a wise and creative decision to make this cartoon in 2.35:1. Most cartoons by Disney are in 1.85:1 or even worsein 1.66:1. Warner did a great job with this movie. These days it seems that Dreamworks SKG and Disney seem to do all the feature length animations. But Warner beat them all in 1999 with this movie.My only gripe is that it should have been longer. At 87 minutes, it's all over too quick. But it's still cool."
"The enigma of the Iron Giant's complex nature is a literary device to make us look at ourselves.  The Giant is a mirror of humanity; making him a space alien is a way of bringing another perspective to our human nature.  On the one hand, we humans seem to be programmed as death machines.  On the other hand, we have compassionate souls.  Which will predominate?  The key to the whole story is simply ""You are what you choose to be.""  Your innate compassion can override your death program.The character of Mansley the bad guy is so malicious as to be actually psychotic.  His only function is to show the madness of the human death programming taken to extremes.  It makes us look back on the Cold War and wonder what the hell went wrong.  The name ""Mansley"" symbolically reflects on Man, who has allowed this insanity to run away with the human race.  The Giant's choice of compassion over death programming is inspiring and uplifting; to get that across in a movie any more you have to disguise it as a kid's movie, but this one is equally enjoyable for kids and adults alike.The technical side of this film shows the impressive advances in conventional animation, to remind us that computer animatronics are not necessarily the last word in this art form.  The most stunning light shows, however, involve weapons of mass destruction.  The Giant's seemingly miraculous ability to regenerate himself as well as whip out a mind-boggling array of destructive devices reminds me of Arthur C. Clarke's dictum: ""Any technology sufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from magic."""
"It would be very easy for me to say this is the greatest animated film I've ever had the pleasure to see, but that would be an understatement and it certainly do no justice to Brad Bird's work.  I don't want to go on and on and I don't pretend to be a critic, but do yourself a favor and see this, it works great as a political statement, an allegory on childhood, or just a splendidly engaging story."
"Seeing the Iron Giant makes one realize just how formulaic and tiresome most movies (especially kids' movies) are.  Fortunately, it also makes one realize how wonderful movies can be.  The Iron Giant does not have an extravaganza of special effects (a'la The Prince of Egypt), yet still is visually magnificent.  It does not have a plethora of sound-alike songs written by a big name in sound-alike songwriting, instead it has a pleasant background of songs true to the setting.  It does  not have the ""Disney Romance,"" a major relief.  Most importantly, The Iron Giant does not talk down to its audience.  The characters had multiple dimensions to their personalities, a feature rarely given to animated characters, details of real people (note Hogarth's crooked tooth), and even *gasp* realistic dialogue.  The Iron Giant  even has a good moral, something I can't seem to find in most other animated features. I can only hope to see more movies as worthy as this one."
