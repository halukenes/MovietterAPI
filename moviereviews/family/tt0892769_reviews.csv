"I watched How to Train Your Dragon about 5 times now, and it never gets boring. It actually keeps on getting better and better with with more and more views. This is a huge accomplishment for DreamWorks Animation, it might actually be its Best Animated Feauture it yet. It is an amazing experience to watch this film in Cinema. The 3D is amazing and at times Breathtaking. I may of had the most fun that I've ever had in Cinema watching How to Train Your Dragon.The script is really good and is has a lot of dramatic depth. This movie is for everyone. Adults and Kids will enjoy it equally and will love it at the end. This movie will probably become a series like Shrek. But I'm hoping this film doesn't get bad sequels like Shrek 3 and Shrek Forever After. Anyways this film will be most recognized for its beautiful animation.10/10 Highly Recommended"
"I saw the trailer and I enjoyed it but I was afraid that all the good parts from the movie will be there and that will be all, like it was with many films lately. That was certainly not the case. There are way better parts that were left to be discovered and I definitely congratulate the choice.I didn't read the book, so I don't know the story, witch might have suffered, as stories usually do from books to picture, but I think a writer couldn't hope for a better image, better portraits of characters, especially the black dragon who one definitely falls in love with - the mimic and the gestures and the face expressions, so complex and real. I agree it's not the kind of movie that makes you keep thinking too much once it's finished bot it's not meant to be. It's just lovely, from the beginning to the end, I really laughed and I was anxious for the characters when they suffered (and I'm 22). The film wasn't too long, it didn't have stupid lines whatsoever and it put to silence the annoying child behind me from the first five minutes or so, which I believe says it all.I don't know if I will actually go to the cinema but I definitely want to see it again. Great special effects and, again, a very lovely dragon."
"HTTYD is the latest in a run of animated 3D films to hit the family market. One might be forgiven for feeling a little weary of this genre as the big production studios churn out one ""action-packed film with a cute central character and some pretty effects"" after another. But wait...HTTYD stands apart from these other attempts for a number of reasons. First, the 3D (Odeon digital in this screening) is moving more toward the subtle with fewer ""gratuitous"" 3D moments than in movies like Bolt and Coraline. As 3D becomes a staple of high street cinema, directors seem to be finding 3D to be more about adding depth rather than a brief focal-point. That's not to say that there isn't effective use of the 3D wow-factor here; it's just not all the film has to hold attention.Second, a cast of voice talent that does not demand too much consideration of the man/woman behind the microphone is refreshing. Baruchel is not over-playing the sugar or the heroics and, as much as an animated character can be, he is believable and as three-dimensional as the visuals. Butler is not greatly stretched here but manages to stay just the right side of a Mike Myers impression so as not to annoy. How many kids will now think the Vikings were a fearsome race of Americans and Scots? Oh, well! Third, the plot and dialogue. You may not know the plot and I won't spoil it now. It is straightforward stuff but the pace keeps it interesting for kids and the grown-ups. Younger children may be upset at times and I heard a sob or two at the emotional moments. Nothing too heavy here though, it's just a well-written script with as many actual laughs as I have seen in a kids' film.This is one of the best films so far in this prolific genre and it has been made with passion rather than thrown together to cash-in on the thirst for these films, right now. I would urge all ages to see this film in 3D as the textures are extraordinary and you can't help but be charmed by it all."
"I saw this film in early March, of 2010 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture ""explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life."" Heartland gave that award to this film.It's in 3-D and it's gorgeous animation. But what really matters is the story. And it's a good one. At first it seems the main story is about a Viking colony equally distant from nowhere, which is being constantly attacked by a wide variety of marauding dragons. It's a full time job trying to keep the dragons at bay and the Viking warriors are often out on their boats hunting their wily and ferocious opponents.But really the story is about a father and chief of the Vikings who has a young son, Hiccup, who is small and who is a slick, sarcastic talker and who doesn't take orders well, but still seeks respect from his impressive father. At first, his Father will not let his son be a warrior Viking, but later relents to have Hiccup train with the other youngsters. But the young boy gets sidetracked and instead of wanting to kill dragons, the boy befriends them and seeks to understand them.A young and inexperienced son seeking approval of a strong father is an often-told tale. Sons often act foolishly trying to impress their fathers. And fathers often ignore the strivings of their sons. In this case, there is honor and courage on all sides and it is inspiring to watch the father and son wrestle with their relationship.And yes, about the dragons – they ARE ferocious and talented and aggressive warriors. But their motivations are a mystery that unfolds slowly. And that's the fun of this film.FYI – There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past Truly Moving Picture Award winners that are now either at the theater or available on video."
"I am not at all interested in dragons and all such fantasy creatures. I don't like children movies with all their stupid messages. I saw this movie rather just to pass the time than to watch it for its sake. And Whoa! I was drawn in this river in first 5 minutes. And what a experience it has been! Right from the start as the narrator describes his world, you are immediately there. You feel yourself in the characters place. The movie does that for you. This is very uncommon movie and it has set a milestone for 3D, not because of its technical aspects, but because of the Depth this movie has. This movie is as much for a 7 year old as it is for an old man who has seen a lot of life. This movie will entertain each viewer in his own way. This is a masterpiece! This movie isn't what it sounds on the surface. It has layers of meanings attached to it. Look at just the title: How to train your Dragon!. If you see it carefully you will notice that there is more to it than meets the eye. Watch the movie and you will know what i mean. This movie cleverly comments on Human Fear, War, Friendship, prejudices, courage, Love. ........................... Don't miss this movie or you will miss one of the few periods when you really LIVE. Note: Just remember to carry your heart with you when you see this movie. It will fill your heart with nothing but what should truly belong there. 10/10."
"If this is done following the same old beat up formula that Hollywood sticks to with regards to animation, then the dragons will be yakking non-stop. Thank goodness that this film, directed by Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, avoids this like the plague, and Jay Baruchel voices Hiccup, a viking kid who happens to be more brains than brawn, more scrawny than buffed, and this of course sets him apart from the rest of his warrior clan folks, who are battle scarred from the constant defense of the village pests - dragons who come from afar to plunder their livestock and setting their houses on fire, so much so that every house on the block is relatively brand new. Wanting to help out in any way he can, he's deemed more of a liability than an asset, especially when even his dad Stoick (Gerard Butler) cannot appreciate his unique, technical talent.In a stroke of uncanny luck, Hiccup downs a flying dragon in the heat of battle, and his compassion meant to set the dragon free, rather than trying to prove himself to be a worthy viking man by killing it. And it's a rare specimen of a dragon too, which would have brought him instant glory. So a bond between man and mythical beast gets struck, and christened as Toothless, this is one pest who slowly grows into a pet, with Hiccup's secret rendezvous resulting in growing appreciation for the species, despite what the knowledge that his kinsman had compiled into a Dragon compendium which details facts all ending with an advisory on compulsory annihilation.The story here is the strength of the film, being witty, smart but never condescending nor insulting the intelligence of the audience. While most characters are caricatures, especially Hiccup's peers, a lot of effort have been put into creating the leads as multi-dimensional and full of heart, and I enjoyed how the characters are so open to their emotions, that it becomes a lot more real than the photo realistic 3D animation and effects. Sure there's the usual father-son misunderstanding and expectations, and how a zero turns to hero, or even the theme of fearing something that we don't fully comprehend, but it's the manner in which the usual got delivered, that made all the difference. Especially so for its anti-war stance, that all it takes is a little step back from the common battle-cry, and instead seek to be understood, by holding out an olive branch, and to understand first.For those who enjoy the mythology of the dragon creature, there are a number of ideas thrown up in the film that would make you nod in appreciation how these got conjured up for the film, and they worked wonders, even though they may be a tad predictable plot wise. And I'm betting that a lot of folks out there will take to Toothless, thanks to its ""stitch""-ish design similar to Lilo and Stitch (since it's co-director Chris Sander's previous work) and huge saucer like eyes, plus a lovable demeanour built into the character that's always apprehensive, and mischievous. Being the creature that has no track record also helped, since it ropes you into a journey of friendship, bonding and discovery with Hiccup as to how powerful his new found friend can be, not to mention how symbiotic their relationship will evolve into as well.Action junkies will find the action sequences in the film faultless, and the 3D got specifically crafted for certain set action pieces that really had me ducking for cover, for once. Fights are incredible, and always accompanied either by humour that worked without the feeling that it was deliberate nor just tried too hard, coupled with the comedic voice talents such as Jonah Hill and Christopher Mintz-Plasse.How to Train Your Dragon is similar to last year's Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs - Long titles, great story, beautiful animation and a total delight. Highly recommended, and it goes into my list as contenders for best films of this year!"
"With a somewhat unwieldy tile and the lack of the winning Pixar storyline that has dominated the Oscars for a decade, Dreamworks animations latest could have been a clunker. Not only is How to Train Your Dragon the best film of the year so far, but it even eclipses the quality of last years duel academy award winner Up.The latest 3-D film to fly into theatres in so many weeks is also the best of its format (story wise), making Burton's overblown misfire Alice in Wonderland look even more pitiful. Dragon will no doubt enamour kids (excuse the cliché) of all ages while keeping parents not only awake but equally enthralled. This movie is sure to tug the hearts of anyone who has ever loved a pet and will undoubtedly draw tears from those who are so inclined.The texture that can be created from today's CG technology never ceases to amaze. Consider a beautiful tracking shot of a downed dragon where the twisted wing that protrudes towards the screen is actually out of focus, as if you yourself were staring awestruck at the giant lizard that lay before you in real, tangible life. I did not have the pleasure to viewing How to Train Your Dragon in 3-D but I have heard great things and even without having paid a surcharge the film does in no way suffer as a result. The narrative, visuals, writing and voicework is ample reason to seek out Dragon and frankly is the real heart of the movie anyways.On the Island of Berk, the Viking community that lives there does not fear a rival tribe, the weather or disease but rather a much more toothy threat: dragons. Nightly raids by the winged beasts have forged a great hatred upon the tribe and led by the aptly named Stoik the Vast (Gerard Butler) they wage war with the intent to rid themselves of dragons once and for all. This is not a feeling shared by Stoik's scrawny son Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) who favours non-lethal tactics as much as he does blacksmithing. Much to Hiccup's surprise, during one of the aforementioned raids he is able to down a dragon with one of his contraptions. Intent on proving his manhood to Stoik, he seeks out to find the dragon know as a Night Fury but finds himself unable to slay his scaly foe. So begins an unlikely and forbidden friendship with the later named Toothless that follows a time-tested but absolutely rewarding arc that is as enthralling as it is touching.Joining Butler and Baruchel, both of whom give excellent performances (with Butler recapturing some of his 300 mojo), are the likes of Craig Fergusson as the Viking blacksmith, America Ferrera as the feisty object of Hiccup's affections and a whole slice of the Apatow gang including Kristen Wiig, Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Jonah Hill as other young warriors. Much like WALL-E, Toothless exhibits oodles of personality and is endlessly endearing. To achieve this level of depth is perhaps even more impressive due to the fact that he never utters a word and must emote through non-verbal means.Along with Kung Fu Panda this movie represents the highest ilk of the Dreamworks repertoire and that is not a backhanded compliment by any means. Like Panda, there are thrilling and well choreographed action sequences to compliment the heart, and plenty of humour to keep this from becoming too much of a dramatic slog for younger theatre goers. Teenager or adult, fan or animation or not if you like truly good cinema, you will not be unsatisfied by How to Train Your Dragon.Read all my reviews at simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com"
"incredible! certainly the front runner for the best animated film of the year. from the first to the last frame this film is as good as an animated film gets on almost every level. beautifully written, designed and executed. though an incredible movie, it's not quite perfection - probably due to time and budget limitations (is there ever enough of either?). that said, the problems i had are far too few to mention. if dragon doesn't absolutely slay at the box office i'll lose faith in middle America. congrats to the filmmakers - you've made a masterpiece and you made me feel like a kid again. thank you."
"Hiccup a young Viking befriends Toothless, a young dragon. This is the best movie I've seen since the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Virtually everything about it is wonderful. Rarely have I been so drawn in to an animated movie. The 3D aspects are thrilling and the movie has a great story, amazing animation, non stop action and a positive and constructive message. It made me want to go out and get a pet dragon. This movie is perfect for people of all ages. Now I know what a feel good movie is. This movie will make everyone feel good. Congratulations to all who contributed to this amazing film. It will make toy dragons a popular gift item. Hope to see it again and again. 3D at it's best."
"This has to be one of the best films I've seen with my family.The characters came to life and was instantly hooked.I've young children and they hardly flinched throughout. The draw to the screen was virtually magnetic.A definite must see for all the family, and the 3d version bought it to life, totally!!The story was well written, even though I must admit the start was a bit slow, but all in all well done dream-works. You've another winner on your hands here.p.s. can't stop talking about it, and its been a week since I've seen it- I can see Oscars in the not too distant future."
"There are a lot of excellent reviews out there, I will just discuss a single point. What got to me the most in this movie is the message I got out of it, I got it from a single line uttered by the hero and it just burned in my memory, it's about how when we look deep in the eyes of our enemies -the ones we fear the most- we will see that they are afraid of us just as we are afraid of them, we might realize their humanity and that they are not what we thought, monsters.This is definitely one of the best 2 animation movies this year, with Toy Story 3 being the other one, tough job for the academy awards this year, and hope this is the case every year.It's nice to see beautiful animation movies challenging Pixar's, it definitely benefits the viewer the most. How to train your dragon - Highly Recommended."
"An animated feast for the eyes is a brilliant description for this film. From the jaw-dropping visuals beautifully rendered in 3D, to the flawless animation of the characters and dragons, this was one film that didn't disappoint.Our protagonist is Hiccup, a boy viking who doesn't possess much in common with his dragon slaying dad. However, when he finds a new friend in Toothless, the most feared dragon of its species, he learns that dragons are not the fearful creatures he was brought up to believe.What I enjoyed the most was the relationship between Hiccup and Toothless the dragon. This was dealt with wonderfully and we see their relationship develop over a series of scenes which were done with great humour and action.The 3D holds its own in every sense, and I would go as far as saying that some scenes rival the groundbreaking Avatar. The scenes that especially stood out were the flying segments where the dragon soars over crystal clear sea's and jaw-dropping backdrops.Whilst this is a film that may seem as if it's solely directed at the younger generation, its stunning visuals and well-told story means that it will keep any adult satisfied."
"Warning: this beautifully animated tale is highly addictive! As soon as it's over you'll immediately want to watch it again. I'm a grown man, but somehow this movie managed to ignore all the layers of cynicism and fake toughness we grown-ups tend to build around ourselves to cope with life; it cut right through to the wide-eyed, adventure-loving boy in me, right through to the heart. It's impossible not to fall in love with this movie, with these characters - especially if you love wild animals. This beautiful story of a very unlikely friendship between a boy who's a bit of an outcast and a dragon is just so well done; it's never cheesy, yet full of passion, and there's simply not a dull moment in it.And although it's very funny, this really isn't just an accumulation of gags and one-liners loosely held together by a paper-thin story: this is a great adventure and touching coming-of-age tale where the protagonist has an actual arc; it tells an intelligent and compelling story about people who are not just one-note characters, and they're wonderfully realized through the great voice-work of such actors as Jay Baruchel, America Ferrera, Gerard Butler and Craig Ferguson. The animation is fantastic, and there's so much playful creative energy at display in the design of the characters - especially in the design of all the different dragon species - that it's simply a joy to watch. 10 stars out of 10."
"This was one of the moments, when you feel so overwhelmed by a movie, that you want to see it again immediately.And when i think of how the whole movie-going began-a theater, full of annoying, noisy kids, 3-th graders mostly.But in the end, you realize you haven't spent any time listening to them, because you are so fascinated by the movie.You feel you are alone in the otherwise overcrowded theater.This feeling is very precious and when you realize it, you know you loved it.The whole idea is very interesting-alternate Dragon-fighting times, an era of vikings and so many kinds of winged creatures.The main character, Hiccup, is the son of a mighty Dragon fighter-Stoick, who is the vikings chief as well.He wants to teach his son the Dragon fighting ways of the vikings, but the boy befriends one of the Dragons, a very rare kind, almost impossible to find.He names it Toothless and they are in for a lot of adventures.The movie is very fresh, but solid and strong as well.And considering it is an animation, the voice performances are very good.That is also important.But the truly strongest sides of the movie are the heart of the movie-it is really a moving picture, but i think, that the level of maturity of the movie is higher, than DreamWorks's previous efforts like ""Shrek"".It is more meaningful, and although it is a Dragon-fighting story it is more real than most of the studio's previous tries in this genre and definitely a step up in animation.The feelings, the emotions, that were expressed throughout made this animation such a memorable experience, and i'm sure, i won't be able to forget it, at least not soon.""How to Train Your Dragon"" is a new, fresh, different start in the animation genre, with a lot of heart and emotions.I think, that's one of the best animations ever made.I recommend it to everyone-from parents with children to more experienced moviegoers and for the more mature audiences as well.""How to Train Your Dragon"" is the best movie this year so far, and a honestly moving picture.An animation masterpiece!*****/*****"
"It's far better then all those Shrecks, Toy stories, Ratatoulies, Puss in boots, Mega-minds and other ""renewing"" concepts. Why? It's simple and honest. This movie doesn't TRY to be funny, modern, super-wise, and ""for all"". It's not one of those ""hey-let's-make-a-movie-about-cat-who-is-a-super-spy"" concepts. This movie JUST tells the simple yet very good story in the most proper way.I have seen a lot of 3D animated movies - American, European, Asian. This one hits 10 in my opinion, because it's by far the most complete vision enclosed in a 3D animated form. But - in addition - it's a pure fairy tale in the core. And I mean PURE - from the cores of fairy-telling, which is the most polite, elegant way of TEACHING important stuff. I think that 3D movie is not only craftsmanship behind creating artificial environment, animating believably, lighting sets with care, etc., etc. Like any other movie - it should be a well told story, which will left you ...CHANGED a bit (that's what fairy tales do, right?) Only those kind of stories will matter in your life. Rest is just ""fun"".'How to train your dragon' is a modern fairy tale. It's modern because - like other mainstream 3D movies - it's excellently crafted. We have here great animation (Toothless, the dragon is ""made of life"", so to speak - you actually just want to HAVE one), lighting and cinematography (splendid flight scenes, which take your breath away, and make you climb your chair), effects, etc.... But it's a fairy tale because - above all that - we have here a master degree directing by Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders too. All those decisions made by them - from very basic (like the look of Toothless and other characters, or editing), to more important (like balancing the amounts of fear, sadness, seriousness and fun tones in the story) are marks of wisdom. And those decisions made a difference between this movie and ""the rest"". Those decisions crafted a SOUL in it. And achieving this ""soul level"" should be a goal of every director.Summing up: great movie in at least two aspects. Technically (character design, animation, cinematography, editing) and emotionally (great simple story with surprisingly 'non-hollywoodish' wise moral, fantastic heart-touching score by John Powell, and mature directing which guide you to be changed a bit after watching).Best achievement in 3D storytelling since Euclide :)"
"Here's an animated movie that has everything it should have, an inspired, but simple story without jokes intended for the adult parents who have to sit with their kids in the theater. In ""How to train a dragon"", it is the majestic artwork that keeps the viewer engaged, with a mix of funny, colored characters and a less heavy handed screenplay than those of pixar. In some ways that should detract from the movie, but somehow it all works into great fun that takes a grown man back to the fun of childhood.Simple, beautiful and a lot of fun.8/10"
"In the Viking village of Berk, all the houses are new since the dwellers are in permanent fight against the dragons. The leader Stoik the Vast is unsuccessfully trying to destroy the fearful Night Fury and locate the dragon's nest to destroy them. His clumsy and inventive son Hiccup works as a blacksmith and dreams on becoming a dragon killer.After a raid of dragons during the night, Hiccup uses the weapon he had invented and he hits the Night Fury. However, he has no witness and nobody in the village believes on his words. Stoik the Vast sails with the Vikings to look for the dragon nest and Hiccup decides to seek out the dragon in the woods, and finds it with a severed tail and can not fly again. Hiccup calls him Toothless and they become friends. The boy uses his skill and manufactures a prosthesis for Toothless and he leans how to control the flight of Toothless.Hiccup learns why the dragons attack his village and finds that his own people had misjudged them. But his great defeat is to prove his father how intolerant the Vikings have been against the dragon.""How to Train Your Dragon"" is a delightful animation with a wonderful message of friendship, intolerance, misjudgment, peace and harmony. The directors and writers succeed in telling how important is to understand other people using the metaphor of the dragons in an original way and with an unusual conclusion. The message of this film is highly recommended for politicians, religious leaders, military intelligence and governors of the world. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Como Treinar o Seu Dragão"" (""How to Train Your Dragon"")"
"There's a reason why I watched How To Train Your Dragon 7 times when it was still playing in theatres. No, it wasn't because I was young and didn't know how to better manage my money (although to be honest, it was a little bit of this). It's because HTTYD had a unique way of unfolding its story. A story about an unlikely relationship that truly moved my heart--between the now very well-known dynamic-duo, Hiccup and Toothless.Throughout the movie, you see each of them grow in awareness about one another, but also in awareness about themselves. This, I think, is what makes their relationship so much more than what meets the eye: before they even know it, they are accepting themselves for their own insecurities and learning not to judge others by first glance. To top off the many hidden lessons, the screenplay is nicely paced and super quirky/funny (a lot of laughs in all the right places). I also think John Powell did an excellent job with the soundtrack (and when I'm not watching the movie, I sometimes just listen to the soundtrack--yes, you could say I'm just a little obsessed). Ever since I was little to today, I have always managed to feel the same childish wonder and magic that I felt that first time I saw HTTYD in a movie theatre. And I can honestly say that I don't think that feeling will ever go away."
"Great, loved it so much. Amazing Good voice acting Loved the books Great author. Great story and other stuff. Animations was good, relate able characters and histrionically accurate. Captures the time of the great and wonderful empire of the vikings. One of the best movies of recent years"
"What can i say, superb film: heads and shoulders above anything else I've seen this year. The 3D works brilliantly, you'll come out of this film truly believing that you can fly.The animation is excellent and the cinematography is so appropriate for this slightly darker animation.The opening sequence is brilliant - setting up all conflict, characters and setting at breathless pace and then quickly moving onwards to develop what becomes a surprisingly involved story of friendship, acceptance, love and believing in yourself!However, the dragon: ""Toothless"" is a standout feature of this film.. go to see it just for the scenes where he and Hiccup interact.SPOILER: One scene that stands out is where they learn to fly, the kinetic energy of that scene is unbelievably empowering, one of the few truly great examples of amazing cinema action in recent times.Some people complained that the side characters were underdeveloped, but I strongly disagree; if you watch closely, there's a lot more depth to them than you would have first thought.Only other complaint was that the vikings were Scottish, and their offspring American. But otherwise a fantastic feel good movie... I'll shut up now, leaving you to go see it (In 3D of course)"
"I read the book before this movie ever entered theaters. I could tell right from the start that the storyline of the movie had nothing to do with the storyline of the book (except for the names of a few of the characters involved). I am surprised the book even mentions that it is now a ""major motion picture"" considering you can hardly even compare the two.In the movie, the Vikings must defend their food and land from attacking dragons, and the young Vikings are trained to become dragon slayers. Hiccup, the chief's son, is a weakling and a screw up who desperately wants to show his father that he is worth something.When Hiccup ends up catching the only dragon no Viking has ever caught or killed, a ""Night Fury,"" he is unable to slay the dragon and instead ends up training him and keeping him for a pet. His dragon, whom he calls Toothless, gives him insight into how dragons think, and he is then able to defeat all the dragons in the sparring ring quite easily without slaying them.Of course, when it is discovered that Hiccup is now able to fight dragons because he has one for a pet, he is ostracized from the clan. His father, who wants nothing more than to find the dragons' lair and slay all dragons, uses Toothless to find the lair. Little does he know that there is a very large dragon living there, and they must now defeat it, aided by the very dragons he grew to hate. In the end, Hiccup is victorious, gets the girl he loves (Astrid), becomes a hero, gains respect from his peers, and changes Viking life as they know it by making pet dragons commonplace.The book is called ""How to Train Your Dragon"" because the characters must do just that. In order to be considered a true Viking, the characters must go and get their very own dragon from the dragon lair and train it. Only the chief's son (Hiccup) is suppose to get a ""monstrous nightmare"" dragon, however, one of the other characters gets one just to spite him.In the book, the characters learn that the only way to really train your dragon (that the Vikings know of) is to ""yell at it,"" and Hiccup tries everything imaginable to train his dragon, all while being taunted and humiliated by his peers. Dragons in the book are ornery and decidedly un-loyal, and are also small enough to perch on shoulders.Toothless in the book is a whiny, annoying character who refuses to be trained, and is called Toothless because he IS entirely toothless. In fact, Toothless in the book is the most pathetic dragon anybody has ever seen; scrawny with no teeth (and is also a ""common green"" type of dragon, which is the most basic dragon any Viking can have). Hiccup makes up a new species to call him so that he is not made fun of, and assures everybody that he has the rarest type of dragon anybody can have.In the ending of the book, the characters must fight two huge dragons (much like in the movie) and their trained dragons aide them. Hiccup becomes a hero by coming up with and executing a plan to slay the large dragons. There is no female character in the book called Astrid, and the other Viking children are much more developed in the book and play a larger role.Overall, both the movie and the book are thoroughly enjoyable, but anybody who has read the book must not compare it to the movie unless they want to be disappointed. The movie has a slightly cookie-cutter and predictable plot (hero messes up, hero wins respect and girl in the end), but is triumphant and humorous with likable characters and lovely animation. There are several tear-jerking moments in the movie, as well as many laugh-out-loud, witty jokes. Overall, this movie is one for the DVD shelf, and will be liked by both children and adults.I think anybody who saw the movie without reading the books will be in for a surprise if they pick up the book series, and anybody who read the books and sees the movie can appreciate both."
"I remember watching the adorable Disney flick Lilo & Stitch at the theater back in the summer of 2002, after a truly exhausting week. The film - which tells the story of a small girl that befriends a wacky alien she mistakes for a dog - managed to put an enormous smile on my face, and made me forget of all my other worries for a while.While watching Dreamwork's new masterpiece, How to Train Your Dragon, I couldn't help but think about the similarities between both it and the aforementioned Lilo & Stitch. Toothless, the lead dragon character from the new film resembles the alien Stitch in shape as well as in behavior. Hiccup, the main human character which befriends Toothless despite warnings from his fellow Vikings, is a semi middle-age teenage version of the character Lilo. A trip visit to IMDb cleared things up for me - Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, the same people who directed the 2002 wonder (L & S) are behind the new and awesome How to Train Your Dragon.Fortunately enough, the similarities end here, and this is not a carbon copy of that film - even though the bottom line (tolerance toward people who are different, etc.) is the same. However, this new film takes place in the middle ages, in a small village which is repeatedly attacked by seemingly vicious dragons. Stoick (voiced by the almighty Gerard Butler) is the head of the village, a pumped up manly Viking who leads the counter-attacks against the fierce dragons. His teenage son, Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), however, doesn't quite fit in. Unlike the older Vikings, who speak in an Irish accent, he sounds like your average American teenager. He's also skinny and small and not exactly the material Viking warriors are made of.After a nightly battle between Vikings and dragons, Hiccup discovers Toothless, a supposedly lethal dragon, which has lost its ability to fly after being injured in the fight. Without anyone knowing, Hiccup slowly gains Toothless' confidence, and the two gradually learn to know each other. After the primal fears disappear, they realize they actually have a great deal to learn about one another – and that friendship is always better than hostility. Soon enough, Hiccup trains Toothless and learns how to approach dragons in general, something that doesn't quite fit in with his father, friends, and the society he lives in in general. But when a greater threat reveals itself, the Vikings and the dragons discover their only hope is to put aside their prejudice thoughts and fight together – with Hiccup and Toothless being their best hope for victory.Bottom line – How to Train Your Dragon is a major victory for the guys at Dreamworks. The film is truly inspiring, with a story that feels self-contained and complete, one that doesn't need to rely on pop culture references to succeed (unlike many of their other products). After a long period of mediocre products (in my opinion) that pale next to their Pixar counterparts, Dreamworks Animation finally came out with the winning formula – which contains just the right amount of relatable characters and true emotions, stunning visuals (including Nordic landscapes and various species of beautiful dragons) and a 3-D element (that uses InTru technology) that really works for a change.Despite the similarities to Lilo & Stitch, I came out feeling that Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders actually managed to improve on their winning hit, and create the best 2010 release I've seen so far – and one of the best animated films to hit theaters in a long long time."
"When the poster was out for this movie I didn't expect much from it; I thought it would be a typical boring animation. By the time the movie was released I was hearing a lot about it, from friends and critics and shows on TV, so I decided to watch it, not in 3D to my dismay. At the beginning my expectations were high, seeing as there was quite a lot of hype about this movie, however I didn't expect it would be this good. It DEFINITELY exceeded my expectations. I loved it. There was something about it that made it different, and better, than any other animation movie I have watched. It had something for all watchers.Hiccup was innocent and yet had the ""hero"" characteristics in him just like any other movie would have (seeing as he is the main character). The dragons were bold, feared yet I wanted to reach out and pet them and possibly squeeze them with love - especially toothless.When the movie ended all I could say was ""I WANT A DRAGON""."
Beautifully animated and scored. The voice cast was well chosen. The sound design for Toothless in particular is excellent.Friendship developments are nicely paced and heartwarming. The characterization of Toothless is really well done.The 'test drive' scene is captivating. The score syncs wonderfully with the visuals.One aspect of this picture that appeals to me is observational inquiry and trial & error. It's a great message to send to kids and adults alike.Fuel for the imagination. Wonderful in all respects.
"it's still managed to make me smile, laugh, tear up and excited every time. And I can still watch it a hundred more times, even at this age loooong past my teens, and still be as entertained as the first time round. This has the perfect dosage of wit, humor, drama, action, scattered bits of suspense and...the perfect team of the six riders. The twins never cease to bring that giggle back, even with their old pathetic jokes. I mean, who would've thought to make a voice cast of Jay Baruchel...which has now become almost iconic! Such a perfect amount of time spent on the build-up; especially the bonding; and the climax. It has one of the best (thought through) story lines. Congratulations to the Dreamsworks team on a job well done. And of course to Cressida Crowell for her creations."
"Dreamworks Animated movies were usually silly funny, crazy, not serious, heartless and forgettable like ""Monsters vs. Aliens"", ""Shark Tale"". but sometimes there are movies that are great, sometimes serious and memorable like ""Kung Fu Panda"". ""How to train your Dragon"" is one of those great movies. The voice casting was perfect, the animation was awesome, great screenplay and music score. it has a lot of action and exciting scenes. ""How to Train your Dragon"" is the best Dreamworks Animated movie ever. ""How to Train Your Dragon"" is better than d' book. The action scenes were awesome, The movie is funny too and the cinematography was amazing. The part when Hiccup was riding on Toothless is better than Jake Sully riding on Banshees from ""AVATAR"". This movie is fun especially in 3D! Gerard Butler was perfect for Stoick the Vast. Jay Baruchel was good. but America Ferrera's performance was bad. This is better than ""AVATAR"" and ""Monsters Vs. Aliens"". ""How to Train your Dragon"" is the best animated movie i watched this year. and this movie gave me goosebumps."
"Honestly I went to see this movie thinking ""just another animation that I probably won't pay attention and will sleep in the movie.""Since my cousin really want to go I had to go with him.In the beginning of the movie nothing happened, I was getting bored and almost sleeping.But when the little kid met his dragon it all turned to be one of the best animation I've ever seen.The skies, the humor and the friendship, the love, and everything in this movie make it worth seeing.Seeing it in 3D will make the things even better, if you are thinking if you should watch it or not, stop thinking and go.I will give it 10 of 10, specially because of the ending.The boy gives the dragon a new part of the tail, how ever in the end the dragon end up being a new part of the boy's leg."
"I went to the theatre expecting good and I got awesome instead. It was incredible... it totally blew me away.Dreamworks has been improving like crazy since they made Kung Fu Panda (except for those franchises like Shrek, Madagascar, etc. Those are hopeless).The plot is nothing new, it's a formula I've seen before: awkward kid who wants to make it big and get noticed in his little town where he's rejected, falls in love with a girl, screws up, disappoints his father, makes it big by accident, girl falls in love with him, screws up again, people hate him again, saves the world, wins. Take Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs and Ratatouille for example. But even though it has a trite plot the storytelling is amazing, they pulled it off so well. This movie has one of the best acting scenes I've ever seen.I loved the art direction in general. The renders are truly beautiful. Everything looks very organic. You can actually see hair on people's skin which is really cool, I think I had never seen that before. It's the perfect balance between cartoony and realistic.The character design was very interesting, especially the dragons. They went nuts designing cartoony dragons and giving them particular qualities. The main dragon looks very Stitch-like but he's nothing like Stitch. There are a few characters whose personalities and appearances match perfectly. I loved every single character in that movie, they're all so different and charismatic, even the ones who are supposed to be annoying are very likable.The fact that the dragons can be trained is very plausible. It made me think that men learned to train and/or domesticate wild animals ages ago. We could domesticate wolves that eventually became dogs, we can train tigers, lions, whales, dolphins, bears... so why can't dragons be trained? Think about it...I'm very happy with this movie it made me be proud of being an animator. I have hope in this industry again...It's probably the best 3D animated movie by far. It LITERALLY made me cry tears of awesomeness. I highly recommend it. Watch it....watch it TWICE at least!"
"The first major film where the agent takes a stake. This is sending shivers through CAA whose power resides in control of the performing talent. The old school agents and the performing talent have distorted the product. This business of animation studios and literary agents is likely to distort things in an equally damaging way. But for now, the shift is visible, welcome and exciting as getout.This is actually written. It grows from within as good writing should rather that seeming like a desired shape made of chicken wire and filled with ordinary bits. Yes, we still have the moralizing because otherwise parents wouldn't think they were parenting. The rendering is cutting edge.But what sets this apart is the use of space. Most folks don't notice this, but we have come a long, long way in five years. I have been following the advances in this. I'll say that if you have not been watching movies in that period, this could make you a bit dizzy because you will not have been walked through the incremental steps in our new spatial imagination.The core quality of cinema is that the filmmaker gets to design your eyes. From the beginning, intelligent filmmakers have experimented with what character the camera might have. This is behind all the filmmakers I believe are great; each added and exploited some new character of eye.With animation, and 3D modeling, it became feasible for the camera to behave in ways that a physical camera could not. Some filmmakers deliberately made their artificial cameras behave like old fashioned ones; perhaps they did not have the skills to move into unusual territory, but I think in most cases the decision was to make the fake world seem real by having the eye treat it as if it were real.Two centers of innovation were WETA (Peter Jackson's shop) and Pixar. Both experimented heaving with vertical motion and depth. Much of this was in flight, sometimes through water. We have precedents, starting with Hell's Angels and slowly working through Star Wars (the original). Then an explosion, and experiments in often overlooked films: King Kong, Treasure Planet, Van Helsing. Now we have the two schools in full bloom.Independently, Dreamworks just couldn't get its groove in animation. Heaven knows they tried to catch up, but they always seemed to be working in space left over from someone else. Here the agent-producer seems to have hired some real spatial talent and let them have control. Even the opening sequence where we see the village and then an attack is spatially thrilling.Luckily, we have two 3D dragonflight movies playing side by side so we can see the two camps compared. Avatar uses WETA and the WETA philosophy. This has the camera as a companion in flight with its own distinct flight path. The excitement is in jumps not in the motion being shown, but the place of the camera.This film adopts the Pixar philosophy which uses POV and POV-inspired notions heaving. In this notion, we are ghosts that can place ourselves anywhere we wish so as to see thing better. We do move, and our eyes do, but motivated by discovery rather than participation.Compare in particular the idea of falling in love as shared, dangerous flight.Thrilling. Simply trilling. We are seeing the birth of a new medium and will dream differently tomorrow.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"I just returned form viewing HTTYD on the big screen, in 3-D, and I must say that I was very impressed. Very, very impressed. Loosely based on a series of books by the same name HTTYD comes at you form the beginning and never lets up. Never a dull moment, never a wasted shot or scene the story progresses quickly but not so quick that you get lost. HTTYD harks at the magnificent novel, Eragon which was butchered into a film with the same name. Even if your not a huge dragon/fantasy fan you will be drawn into a story of a boy who fails at everything that is expected of him and knows it, a dragon who acts more like a giant cat, an over ambitious girl, and village full of steel-wielding vikings. The film is also hilarious and filled with one liners that have me laughing even now. The story is simple: a village of stubborn vikings battle dragons to survive until a misfit boy learns secret that could change everything. There are also heart felt moments, hilarious moments and the classic ""OH NO!"" and ""OH YEA!"" moments that are the back bone of any classic movie. This movie is, in some ways like the Incredibles but also in a class of its own. There are some moments that might scare younger viewers, a far amount of violence and some sexual references. I saw it with my family all seven of us, an age range form 45 to 6 and every one loved the movie. So, go see it on the big screen! Don't wait for DVD and BR release GO NOW you won't regret it! If you can, pay the extra cash and see it in 3-D it worth it! This is the best movie of 2010 so far. GO NOW!"
"How to Train Your Dragon is probably the best Dreamworks picture I have ever seen. If you didn't know it was a Dreamworks picture, I wouldn't be surprised if you thought it was a Pixar film. No lies. This movie is almost as good as those amazing Pixar movies out there.First off, let me say that you must watch this movie in 3D. It's not one of those movies that has 3D for the sake of it. It's ACTUALLY a 3D film. The visuals are absolutely stunning and a definite must see in 3D.The plot it self is so beautiful. It's not very predictable and being a teenager, this movie did get to me. This movie is enjoyable for both adults and young kids. Warning: The Dragons may look a little scary to some younger kids.All in all, the visuals are perfect. The plot/dialogue can fool you to thinking the film is Pixar. And in the end, it's an enjoyable movie for all ages!"
"My eight-year-old nephew and I just got back from seeing How to Train a Dragon 3D at an IMAX. Can we just say WOW, over and over again?! We won't tell you give you all the details because that's already been done in other reviews. Just let us say that we are already talking about going to see it again and also owning the movie as soon as it comes out! It was one of the best movies we've seen in years (and we watch a lot of movies)! The animation is absolutely stunning, but the story is even more wonderful, especially the story lines between the father and Hiccup and Hiccup and the dragons. But the whole story from beginning to end was fascinating and adults and children both will love this movie. We both cried happy tears at the end and still have not stopped talking about how fantastic it is and how much we loved it. We say RUN to your nearest theater to see How to Train a Dragon!"
"One of the best films of the year, animated or not. An astounding script, great voices, a beautiful soundtrack, the occasional Norse mythology reference, and great action and scenery. The computers really know how to draw. One thing that bugs me is how dragons fly. Birds have hollow bones and that sort of thing but what of dragons? Their wings do not seem big enough to carry their own weight, much less that of a human rider. But a minor detail to be sure... Great movie. 3-D can help the graphics but even without it, I love it. Amazing family film that all can enjoy complete with slapstick and simple gags. It had better win some awards for awesomeness."
"How to Train Your Dragon may not have a complex plot but its plot with the help of its 3D is engaging enough to keep my eyes glued to the screen. It is also a fun light movie that kids can enjoy. Alice in Wonderland may be a little dark for them. This has some scary/intense scenes with the dragons but it should be fine for the kids as most of the dragons appeal to them. DreamWork movies now are usually 3D and Pixar is following after it. I think DreamWork movies keep improving. I actually find this better than its last movie, Monsters Vs Aliens.The story: Hiccup dreams to kill dragons like Vikings do. He is often ignored by his father when he says he wants to help kill dragons because of his ""weak"" size. When he finally caught a dragon, he gets closer to it and soon, he understands everything he wants to. The plot is straight forward, there is no twist to twist and turn the story. One thing that caught me while watching is the striking John Powell's score. He did an epic score for this which is another factor which contributes to the greatness of this movie. You got cool 3D effects, an enjoyable plot with humour and striking John Powell's score.Overall: It amazes me how much I enjoyed this movie. I never expected much from a DreamWork movie but instead this proves me wrong. I am surprised that this takes little time to dwell on the emotions of the characters and use the remaining time to make a funny action-packed movie. It is a good 3D movie for the kids if you think Tim's Alice In Wonderland is a little too dark."
"I've said it before but I'll say it again here and that is that it is unfair of Dreamworks to have to compete with the consistently high quality of Pixar films – films that deliver so strongly on so many aspects across the board. I say this because I did really enjoy HTTYD but still found myself wondering how much more character, emotion and comedy Pixar would have brought to the same story. This is unfair of me but yet I cannot help it. HTTYD is a great little tale where a Viking boy learns about the enemy (the dragon) and finds that perhaps everything he has been taught about them is a lie or, at best, one big misunderstanding. The moral of the film is pretty clear as is the general direction of the narrative.This doesn't stop it being engaging and entertaining though because it is. The story plays out well and is funny and had me interested and caring throughout, while the characters were solid. Problem is that all of it is good – but yet none of it excels. So on the characters: they are all solid and do what is required but none really absorbed me to the point I forget they were cartoon creations voiced by actors. Likewise the comedy, it was consistently amusing and had a few nice touches here and there but the side characters didn't provide the depth or comedic value that Pixar so often manages to do with their equivalents. But it is still good stuff though and children will love it while adults will find it easy to enjoy – I watched with no children and only another adult in their 30's and none of it came over as ""below us"" or aimed at children with no appeal to us – which, for all my critical comparison, is a hard thing to achieve but this did it well.The animation is very good of course but in particular they have done the action sequences very well, making them exciting and intense without being hard to follow or see what is happening. The voice cast are mostly OK but they do all suffer from the inability to make their characters real. Baruchel is solid enough in the lead but not great. Likewise Butler turns in another ""meh"" performance for me but at least here his Scottish brogue helps him and his lack of screen charisma doesn't hurt his voice work. Ferguson is a better piece of casting as his voice is fun and he seems to have a natural humour about him – I don't like his show myself but he did work well here. Beyond them there isn't the dept I would have liked. Hill was so-so, Likewsie Ferrara and Mintz-Plasse – although none of them really impress me too much in other films so no surprise that they don't here either. Solid work by all, but nobody really hit it out of the park.Overall HTTYD is an enjoyable and entertaining family film that delivers comedy, a good story and thrills to good effect. It doesn't excel in any specific area when viewed on an open field though but, while watching it the film keeps you involved enough so that the comparisons to Pixar occur after, not during the film."
"How to train your dragon is another good animation provided by DreamWorks where the main character is a viking boy named Hiccup who is more like the kid-with-brain than the kid-with-muscles. He always wanted to prove himself worthy in battling real dragons but life decided for him that he will prove worthy to himself by understanding those creatures. He somehow manages by luck to hurt and ""catch"" the ""Night Fury"", the dragon everyone wanted to catch, but instead of killing him he finds his own fear and loneliness into Fury's eyes, making him to spare his life. From that point the story goes on and is delivered quite well for this type of movies though I have some complains about continuity or even logic but I'll keep those to myself.What I did not like about this was the voices. And when I say the voices I don't mean that they didn't act well but one question hit me from the beginning: Why all those different English accents in the same actual group? You got irish, Scottish and American accents which makes no actual sense. But I guess that was the fault of the casting team. Anyway besides that everything seemed pretty original and entertaining.The characters were not that great developed I mean it was the usual stuff but I won't be ""trolling"" to call them clichés. The dialogue suffered here and there and some action-scenes especially when Hiccup was training were ridiculous like when the dragon chased all of them in that ring, Hiccup was very relaxed and kept on asking Gobber things about the ""Night Fury"" which was kind of you know.. lame... because who would do that even if you're a nerd you're still scared or at least concerned about the dragon that chases you...Besides this the movie was edited well, same goes for the cinematography, music was good but nothing tremendous and the 3D was really great as far as the effects and all... but with all these the movie missed something for me... 8.3 on IMDb almost the equal of ""Up"" or Wall E... I mean... this is one overrated movie... It's good for kids, families and all of that but not that good that anyone could find it appealing because it doesn't develop any real emotions at all... feeling sorry for your father's wishes as for your destiny, finding the good in what people saw bad, the girl who's indifference changed into interest for you and all that are clichés and they are used in so many animation movies that I can't give this one propz even if it's entertaining and fun to watch. And talking about characters and dialogue, it was pretty cheesy at moments, few major jokes and few characters that you would remember after leaving the theaters like people still remember the pigeons from Bolt or the Hamster... because they were ridiculously funny... here? I did not get that feeling...As far as the score I didn't actually felt it... It was good I guess it fitted the movie's personality but it was no near Up, Wall E or Coraline... to mention some animations from the last 2 years...Movie is well executed, but it seriously has it's ups and downs and it's downs should count more since it's so overrated..."
"In an age where 3D technology is becoming the primary appendage to ""hook"" audiences in, it's refreshing to watch a film that uses it more as an accessory than the main attraction (*cough* Avatar *cough*). Directed by Dean Deblois and Chris Sanders (Lilo & Stitch) the film is set around a Viking village on the island of Berk that is periodically raided by dragons that steal from their flock of sheep. The film follows the adventures of Hiccup, a scrawny, awkward and socially outcast Viking boy who aspires to follow the tradition of his tribe in becoming a dragon-slayer, only to discover that he does not share his fellow Vikings' brutish nature. The film itself is visually stunning with beautifully drawn landscapes and characters. The dragons are especially well crafted, ranging from a fire-breathing monster to a comical flying blowfish. Although I was sceptical at first, the 3D elements were also a nice touch. It made the island of Berk a little more immersive, without overshadowing the film completely. However, where the film really shines is in its musical score, which is brilliantly composed and enhances the emotion of every scene it is used in. Like any film, however, How to train your Dragon has its flaws. It heavily relies on slapstick humour which, although funny at first, quickly got stale. The first 20 minutes were particularly weak, to the point where after the characters were introduced the humour became extremely lacklustre and the entire plot seemed to stall for a good 5 minutes or so. Also, without giving too much away, the central message of the film is basically thrown out the window during the climax which made the film seem like a slightly shallow experience as I left the cinema. Despite the critique, How to train your Dragon was a fun film. No, it's no Pixar's Up, but it makes for a fun, heart-warming and light-hearted hour and 20 minutes. Check it out."
"Dreamworks Animation films doesn't have the consistency of Pixar. Whereas Pixar's worst films are still ""Very Good"", when Dreamworks films are bad, they are often atrocious. But now and again, they churn out a movie of utter brilliance, that I end up being floored with shock and elation. Films such as Antz (which in fact was better than Pixar's A Bugs Life IMHO), Monster House and Kung Fu Panda spring to mind.So which category does How to Train Your dragon fit in? Well, since my review is very late on this board, amongst unanimously positive reviews, there will be no surprise in guessing that I put this in the utter brilliance category.From start to finish, this movie strikes a great balance of wit, action, drama, and character. This is high calibre entertainment with breathtaking visuals.The protagonist is your usual, unlikely hero, voiced with almost Woody Allenish wit. Though sometimes the voice sounds a little too old for the young animated counterpart but thats a small niggle.This is just quite simply tremendous animated entertainment, fast moving, thrilling and fun. The comedy is sophisticated, devoid of toilet humour, crass jokes. And absolutely no modern popcorn references which I generally hate, which even Pixar is sometimes guilty of.Both kids and adults will love this. Out of Dreamworks output, I rate this above Shrek, on par with Kung Fu Panda and just behind Monster House and Antz."
"How to Train Your Dragon offers no practical dragon training information. NONE. Zero stars.To be honest I am not impressed. The title clearly suggests that instructions would be provided on how I can train my dragon. Clearly this was just marketing hype and false advertising. I am surprised that others have given a positive review. Surely I'm not the only person who thinks that a book titled ""How to Train Your Dragon"" would over at least SOME practical training information? Terribly disappointed. I would like my money back."
"Right from the start this one is a winner. The new Dreamwork animation is a happy-go-lucky kind of animation with a serious story to it. The makers never took themselves seriously or lightly, they were somewhere in the in-between (:P) and that is where their victory lies.Getting down to the story A Viking Tribe lives close to the seas and what do they have to worry about in their calm lives – DRAGONS. And the stubborn vikings fight, fight, fight but with no end result. And among these there is ,Hiccup, the only child of the chief of the tribe who is different. He is not strong as the others neither does he have good Viking skills. But one fine day he shoots down one dragon by luck. He traces it down and it is one of those dragons that is considered to be the most dangerous by the tribe. There are strict orders to kill it on sight. But the little kiddo never had it in him to do that. He cuts it loose and then the bondage starts between them. And the rest of the story is about how the kiddo and the dragon change the path of the lives and minds of the the tribe.This is by far, the best movie of the year. The animation is stunning. Some of the wide angle shots and sweep shots are brilliant and the detail is also amazing. Action sequences are another treat. It is a goose-bumping experience. And the story is also good as it tugs at the strings right at the bottom of the heart. And there is lot to laugh as well. Brilliant one-liners that go well with the movie. ""Death by the Dragon, is an occupational hazard here"".something on that line.The voices by Jay Baruchel and Jonal Hill were good. And believe me, some scenes brought me to tears, some scenes had me jumping out of seat out of excitement. No wonder, the animation won the Heartland Truly Moving Picture Award. And Pixar can learn some valuable lessons from this animation.All in all, this is great and a must watch.9/10"
"""How to Train Your Dragon"" is an animated feature film from 5 years ago that was nominated for 2 Academy Awards. It lost Score to ""The Social Network"" and ""Animated Feature"" to ""Toy Story 3"". Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders directed this film and they were also 2 of the 4 people who adapted Cressida Cowell's book so successfully for the big screen. A second film followed and also a television series plus several short films that were mostly added as DVD material. I will not go a lot into detail about who the voice actors here are. You can check that in the list of cast and credits. The movie runs for slightly under 90 minutes not counting the credits and, thus it is a bit shorter than the sequel, but not by much.There is one main antagonist in this film: a gigantic dragon. To me, movies usually stand and fall with how interesting this main antagonist is. And I have to say that I did not find him too interesting. The reason is probably that we do not find out too much about him really. Apparently, he threatens all the other smaller dragons and forces them to bring him tons of food on a regular basis. This is why the dragons only steal from the humans in order to secure their own survival. This explanation is a major plot-point of the film in order to explain how humans and dragon co-exist peacefully at the end after centuries of fighting. The main character is Hiccup, a boy who just does not seem to have it inside of him to fight dragons. After a fateful meeting with a black Night Fury dragon, the two become friends and their relationship is put to the test. Same goes for the boy's relationship with his father, which is one of the emotional core points of the film. I said earlier that I was not too fond of the main antagonist. This is, however, not a major problem here as the movie is much more about humans and dragons bonding than about defeating the beast.There are some very beautiful scenes in this film. I thought Toothless, the Night Fury, was animated greatly. I loved his face expressions when he interacts with Hiccup all the time. I also really loved the flying scene with Astrid and Hiccup on Toothless. A thing of beauty and certainly this scene alone is worth watching the film on the big screen. But there are more of course. Yes there are also a couple slightly cringeworthy moments like Hiccup becoming too heroic and a couple really untrained kids on small untrained dragons defeating the big monster, but oh well. Dragons are fantasy creatures anyway, so we should not expect too much realism in here. It's sometimes tough to remember that, but if you do, you will be rewarded.As a whole, I enjoyed this film. Certainly among the best animated films from 2010, even if I have to admit I liked ""Toy Story 3"" still a bit more. So I am with the Academy on this one. And I also actually liked the sequel to HTTYD even more than this one, especially because of its emotional impact. This is one area, during which this film here sometimes came a bit short. Nonetheless, it was a pretty good watch and overall, I recommend ""How to Train Your Dragon"". Definitely worth checking out. Maybe if you are unsure, watch an episode of the television series first or a short film and decide then, but I am positive that you will not be disappointed. Thumbs up."
"I wasn't fortunate enough to watch this movie in 3D, though I wish that I had gotten around to doing it. I bet watching ""How to Train Your Dragon"" in 3D would be downright awesome. I sure enjoyed the movie tremendously in ordinary version.This animated movie was, simply put, fantastic. Next to the ""Final Fantasy"" animated movies and the ""Resident Evil: Degeneration"" animated movie, ""How to Train Your Dragon"" is without a doubt the best animated movie I have seen in a long, long time.The story told in ""How to Train Your Dragon"" is very likable and you immediately immerse yourself into the plot, because it is really such a good tale. Lots of adventure and warmth in the story, and it works so well.And the animation itself, wow! Simply fantastic. It looks so very good, lots of amazing details and very colorful. This is the way all animated movies should be, sparkling with colors and life.And the Night Fury dragon had so much character and personality, despite it didn't utter a single comprehensible word throughout the entire movie. I bet you will love him right away, I know I sure did.As for the cast, well voice cast actually, lots of really good names here. I especially enjoyed Gerard Butler in this movie, he has a very good voice that is well suited for voice acting. But also among the impressive cast was America Ferrera, Jonah Hill, Kristen Wiig, and more. Lots of really nice voices to be found here.However, there is one downside to the movie, I am from Denmark, so the vikings are part of my heritage, and people here (and back then) didn't speak English with a Scottish accent. That, and that alone, was the only drawback of the movie. But it is a minor detail, and I looked past that. And as in going with the Scottish accent, why didn't Hiccup speak with that particular accent? And no offense to Jay Baruchel, but there is just something very annoying about his nasal voice. It just doesn't go well with me.But moving on, ""How to Train Your Dragon"" is definitely a movie that you just have got to watch in any way you can. This movie is amazing, and that is the end of that! Thumb up, way, way up for this masterpiece. It has entertainment value for children and adults alike."
"The trailer of this movie was so unpromising and unattractive. It did not make me want to watch this, in 3D no less. However, my kids all wanted to watch it, so of course, my wife and I had to go with them.The first one-fourth of the movie was very static and slow for me, all talk. I felt very sleepy and was in fact, drifting off. I did not really immediately like the appearance of the kids, which I found generally annoying. However, when time came that our hero (with the improbable name of Hiccup) met his cute dragon pal (with the equally improbable name of Toothless), the movie picked up pace and from there, it never looked back.The next three fourths of the film was alive with beautiful 3D animation and very heartfelt and touching writing. I know we have all seen flying dragons before (like in ""Shrek""), but the additional animated depth and the fantastic background scenery gave this one a breath-taking quality that made it distinct. The very meticulous and larger-than life scenes of the Viking armada at sea, the Vikings running from the exploding mountain, and especially the final climactic battle, were truly in a class of their own. That is saying a lot in these times when 3D animation seems to be the standard already, and not the exception.The story of the rough tough father and his weakling son has been played in out in various ways in so many various movies before. But somehow, the way it is played out here still managed to be effective in drawing out genuine emotions. The straightforward storyline and familiar conflicts were successfully brought to a higher level by the original vision and masterful direction of Dean de Blois and Chris Sanders (of ""Lilo and Stitch""). This is a shoo-in for one of the nominee slots in the Best Animated Feature Oscar for the coming year."
"How To Train Your Dragon was a very surprising delight. I certainly did not expect a film of this high caliber. The story and the characters are strong, the direction graceful, and the animation beautiful. It is an animated film that goes back to the classic animated films where, while the animation is enough to get people excited, it's writing is what grabs your heart and never lets go. The voice-overs are great, and the two main characters, Hiccup and Toothless, are probably the most thoughtful and moving animated characters since the duo in WALL-E. And in this time, where most of the films in 3-D really do not need it, the 3-D in this actually boots your excitement level and enhances you into the story a lot more. I think as far as 3-D in animation goes, this is the best I have ever seen. The music score is also amazing, and I loved listening to it, especially in the subtle scenes between Toothless the Dragon and Hiccup bonding.It has been a long time since Dreamworks has come out with a really great film, especially an animated one, but this is finally it! It surprised me, not only because it is Dreamworks, but because it is March and not the time of year to release a film like this. But BRAVO!"
"After squirming through some real losers like ""Bee Movie"", this is the most enjoyable children's film I've seen in several years.I watched it with my 5 yr-old grandson and both of us were equally engaged and entertained from start to finish. That's quite a stretch and no small task for today's audiences.I went to the cinema expecting to snooze through some sappy ""boy meets dragon"" Lassie tale. But the story is astutely pulled together with sophistication, sensitivity, and a lot of excitement.Why this movie succeeds: 1. The main characters are endearing and simply don't come with any saccharine cutesiness. Jay Baruchel captures the character of ""Hiccup"" with a wit and style that doesn't pander to youngsters or is otherwise gratuitous.2. The dragon ""Toothless"" thankfully doesn't talk, sing, or act like a human covered in scales. It doesn't exude some sappy puppy dog love. Nor pop philosophy, which made the film ""Dragon Heart"" mawkish. Toothless simply acts as an intelligent creature that communicates though an enchanting range of expressions.3. The film has one nicely simply yet deep message for kids: treat all forms of life with respect, kindness and empathy. The film doesn't try to monotonously cram some New Age or politically correct rhetoric down your throat, as ""Wall-E"" did.4. The editing and pacing is superb. There is never a dull moment. The film zooms along with nonstop action, adventure, fun and dry wit. It is visually stunning in 3D.Don't wait for the DVD."
"O.K. Here is the deal. I am a normal guy. I watch football. I run marathons sometimes. I fix my car. I only intended to glance at this movie to see if it would be appropriate for my five-year-old. I ended up staying for the whole movie.During the flying scenes, with the perfectly-suited Galic music cheering us on in the background, I had tears of purest joy streaming down my face from the, raw, visceral emotion of it. I thought of Gerard Manley Hopkins and the Windhover: ""The dapple-dawn-drawn falcon in his riding .../.. High there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing In his ecstasy! then off, off forth on swing"" Perfect movie making. I have to say, I've seen nothing like these scenes, and I cry at movies every, I dunno, twenty years or so? Let's be clear: this is an animated movie for kids. The story is straightforward, at the level that, yes, my five-year-old will understand. The music is very good. The story-animation is so well done that it just falls into the background as the story unfolds. It is not ""artful"" in the way of, say, Miyazaki, but it is still wildly creative and yields a magical world of ocean, rugged northern lands, and forest. The animation of the physics of flight and motion, and the details of emotional expression are exceptional. The voice actors are interesting, and without the sappy voices, and contrived humor we have found in some other recent animated movies. There is no pretense here of the movie trying to be something it is not. There are inconsistencies in the accents, and holes in the plot if you care to look. But, and this is the important but, the story, and especially the *experience* of this movie transcends both the genre and its shortcomings. Even if it is just for the highlights as one is soaring above ocean and earth on the back of a dragon, this is a movie for way more than just kids.At the end of the movie, most everyone cheered, and half stood up and cheered, which I also have not seen before.I recommend this movie as genre art that is exceptionally well done, an uplifting evening's entertainment. You MUST see it in 3D! Yaaaaayyyy! Who-hoooh!"
"I have recently got obsessed with How to Train Your Dragon. Why you might ask? Well because it is the most fantastic, amazing, brilliant movie I have ever seen. Why? Well first of all the music is perfect, always capturing the moment perfectly. Second, the story it just amazing. I don't want to give anything away, so just watch and you will see why. Third, the voice acting is fantastic. Jay Baruchel voices Hiccup the main character, and America Ferrera voices the love interest Astrid. Jay Baruchel does a perfect job at voicing Hiccup because he is just like Hiccup in many ways. Forth and final reason why this movie is fantastic, amazing, and brilliant is that the visuals are amazing. The animation looks nothing like you have seen before. You can see every little freckle on Hiccup's face, even a scar or two. Most people would think of How to Train Your Dragon as a children's movie. Well I don't think so and Dreamworks doesn't either. Dreamworks has said many times it is not intended to be only a children's movie, but more of a teen and adult flick too. You will notice if you ask a kid about this movie they do not remember it that well. Why, because they have seen so many other movies that just stuck more because of how childlike they were. Most of the fans are teens and adults, but that doesn't mean kids would't like it, just that teens and adults will appreciate it a lot more. This movie deserves a 10 out of 10, and I say buy it! If you have a 3D TV watch in 3D because the 3D also looks fantastic. Dreamworks made the best animated movie ever! It will forever be remembered and is a classic that everyone should see."
"I can't even begin to talk about why I love this film so much. For starters, the voice casting is amazing. Jay Baruchel is a great protagonist, America Ferrera is a wonderful female lead/love interest. People like Gerard Butler (as King Leonidas) and Craig Ferguson (as Craig Ferguson) play off each other so well, and the other teens (T.J. Miller, Kristen Wiig, etc.) were good supporting characters.Second, it's a rich and fantastic story. I only found out a few days ago that this was based on a book, and while I haven't read it yet, I'm definitely going to. There are too many funny scenes to list, but I really love all the interactions with Toothless and Astrid. It's the little things like his eyebrows that get me. I really /really/ hope that they choose a better name for the sequel though."
"And I loved Ratatouille and WALL-E. This is the best animated movie of of them all. I am a ""senior citizen"", who, of course, grew up with Disney animated movies. Loved animated movies then and still love them now - especially when they are as good as this. It first came to my attention in 2009 when I started reading blogs that jerry Butler was doing the voice over for this movie with the interesting title. I am a HUGE jerry butler fan, but despite that, I still missed it at the theater. Then I saw it on HBO and HAD to get the Blu-Ray DVD for our HD TV. Best thing I ever did. Movie is beautifully put together, all the way around - animation, script and character's voices. Great Cast - right down to the smallest character. Craig Fergeson was a surprise - I love him, too - and almost upstages Jerry Butler. But the best characters of the movie are Hiccup and Toothless, the dragon who is more a cross between a playful, lovable pet black panther and a stealth bomber than the scary villains dragons are supposed to be. The flying scenes are awesome and the interaction, understanding, tolerance and deep friendship that develops between Hiccup and Toothless (especially at the end) is the best part of the story. I have watched it at least 20-25 times, still enjoy it each time and still laugh at the one-liners. I actually have my favorites that I laugh out load at each time! It is quite an enchanting and enjoyable movie for ""kids"" of all age. Rent or buy this movie in Blu-Ray. You won't be sorry. Bravo Dreamworks! Would love a well-written sequel with all these great characters."
"Based on a novel with the same name, writer William Davies was able to turn this kids story into a touching and deep first-class screenplay that is really rare for Dream Works. Hiccup, voiced by the devastating and believable Jay Baruchel, is a weak and low self-esteem little boy who lives in a world of Vikings. His dad and his friends, all around him, their life mission is to kill dragons and Hiccup is expected to do the same. Going through training and a lot of trying, Hiccup was not successful. Instead of killing dragons, Hiccup decided to read books on the dragons and found out they are not that bad. The belief was brought on after Hiccup met a dragon, who was considered the most dangerous dragon and did not try to eat him. This created a interesting but predictable twist for the audience to eat up on. Hiccup named his ""friend"" Toothless. Months go by as Hiccup trains his dragon friend Toothless to fly since he was injured when Hiccup found him. Throughout the training, their relationship begins to build and we see that Hiccup is falling in love. The writer really wanted us to cry at this point because Hiccup's friend Toothless was discovered by the town people and he's being killed by them. At the end, we know that dragons aren't as bad and Vikings shouldn't be killing them. This really looks like Disney's work because the message and the tone of the film is based on being friends and nice and all. At first, I thought this was not Dream Work's work, but after checking up on it, I was surprised. This looked more like Disney's cheesy work than Dream Work's. How To Train Your Dragon is classy, funny, kid-friendly, and intelligently scripted. It is one of the best films of the year. OscarBuzz: Best Animated Feature, this will go head to head against Toy Story 3. Even though Toy Story 3 definitely has a lead, if it didn't win, How To Train Your Dragon would snatch the Oscar."
"This is a DreamWorks film? Wow, impressive. ""How to Train Your Dragon"" is a real shocker, it's a film that was made by DreamWorks Animation but it didn't really feel like a DreamWorks animated film. It felt like it was more in line with a good Disney film or any of Pixar's films. I've always had my doubts about DreamWorks after ""Shrek 2"", as they began sinking into a formula that is now annoying and irritating. ""How to Train Your Dragon"" is a refreshing effort that tries its hardest to break free from the formula.Based on Cressida Cowell's children's book of the same name, ""How to Train Your Dragon"" is a satisfying action-adventure that mostly fires on all cylinders. The characters are likable, and you can root for them, unlike most DreamWorks films where the characters are obnoxious or annoying. The dragon, Toothless, is easily the best character despite being a non-speaking character. Like the most appealing animated characters, he's instantly likable. Hiccup and Toothless' friendship is believable and not contrived. It's a winning effort.Aside from the storytelling, the animation was really good. The art direction and character animation were fabulous, more in line with Pixar's visuals than anything else DreamWorks has done. Prior to ""Dragon"", DreamWorks' films were questionable in terms of character animation. ""Dragon""'s art direction is great, from high seas to detailed forests to the elusive dragons' nest. The crew working on this film knocked themselves out, and it puts everything else from DreamWorks (with the slight exceptions of ""Shrek"" and some of their traditional hand-drawn efforts) to shame.The screenplay wasn't great, but it was certainly much better than the obnoxious DreamWorks films before it. It's not constant pop culture jokes and toilet humor being shot at you. However, the writing was still a little weak because of the modern-slang slant to it. Otherwise, it was not cringe-worthy or anything. I also thought that some of the dramatic moments were a little downplayed, but it was nice to see moments like that in a DW film. The film was also devoid of using some pop song in the middle of the film.So DreamWorks scored a near-home run. It feels more sincere than the other films, it isn't the usual sitcom-dialogue, pop culture joke-laden romp from DreamWorks. It was a fine adventure story with some knock-out moments and easily DreamWorks' most appealing creation, Toothless. Maybe it was great because Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois directed it, being the two behind Disney's ""Lilo & Stitch"", and of course Toothless somewhat resembles Stitch and Sanders' drawing style.A real winner. Highly recommended. 8.5 out of 10."
"With the whole 3D movie craze finally becoming a normal thing, movies need to push themselves in order to ""stand out"" more than the others. How to Train Your Dragon is the latest entry into the new dimension of films.I'm starting to get annoyed by the whole 3D cash-in scheme, but this film was worth my time and money. This film boasted terrific animation, some great voice work, but the story of the town outcast appears in every kids movie, so the plot suffered a bit.There is enough humour in this film to entertain both kids and adults, thanks to some entertaining characters (some of the dragon designs are fantastic, their emotions are believable!). How to Train Your Dragon is well recommended."
"Where can I begin a review when I have so much to say about this movie? Without giving anything away from the plot it is brilliant. for children it opens up a land of magic and wonder. For adults it is a breath taking experience full of love, struggle, and hardship that draws you in and never lets you go.The characters in this movie were amazing and its what really made it come together. I actually cared about them and what happened to them. and became worried when any one of them were in Danger especially at the end. The love between the main character and his dragon is especially a wonderful experience you can feel the emotion the dragon and the main character have for each other. It made me go out and bring my dogs inside for the night. It also showcases the struggle families sometimes experience you can just see how badly the main character wants his father to be proud of him. And how much the father wishes to protect his son as well as relate to him. You can feel there care and love for each other even when things are at there worst. But it never goes overboard with love as so many movies do now a days it shows us that life can be a struggle and full of dangers and hardship but we are never alone and must never give up. The dialogue of the movie is spot on and I believed I would say the same thing in many of the situations the animation was perfect in all aspects.Sound/Atmosphere Both are incredible the sound seems to be right on cue and is perfect from beginning to end it fits every single scene. The Surronding land is breath taking it filled me with ideas and really made me want to be there.Bottom line This movie is a masterpiece and a must see. It helped me get over my writers block and gave me back the emotion I needed to continue my story and refueled my imagination. It is better then any animated film I have ever seen in my life as well as many non-animated films. I want to scream for a sequel but I think it would be better to leave this film be and let our imaginations make our own sequel. The only downside to this film is when it ended. Because I would give anything for it to be real."
"How To Train Your Dragon is the latest offering Dreamworks has released but could this be as big or as bold as Shrek? The story is very imaginative and is guaranteed to keep the attention of children and adults. The characters were lovable and the dragons were simply adorable, especially Toothless. The animation was marvellous and doesn't disappoint in quality which was to be expected from Dreamworks. The script is very cleverly written like everything else in the movie. Great characters, good music, brilliant animation and fantastic humour, this doesn't disappoint.I simply fell in love with this movie. I loved Shrek and Kung Fu Panda but this beats them in my opinion. The animation was simply crafted beautifully and you could tell that a lot of time and effort had gone into it and is probably the best animation I've seen for years in a kids' movie. I also liked how the dragons didn't talk, I thought it added a sense of reality to the movie (even if there is dragons in it). This doesn't mean Toothless, the main dragon, is boring, far from it. Toothless and Hiccup was fantastic as their trust and friendship made for heart-felt viewing and some funny scenes. The best scenes, in my opinion, was the flying scenes with Toothless and Hiccup, the animation during them scenes were phenomenal to watch. The characters were great as well and Hiccup's crush Astrid was great as she tries to figure out what Hiccup is up to.Overall, the movie had fantastic scenes, beautiful animation, great characters, voice acting, script and storywhat more could you possibly want from an animation? I highly recommend everyone to watch this, this is one not to miss! Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com"
"This is one of the only films that features dragons and humans working alongside each other - and it's animated! What else can you ask for?The story starts off with a short narrative from the main character, Hiccup (what an interesting name), who introduces the setting quite clearly and obviously. Good. I don't like to be confused with where I'm going with a movie. There are many nice special effects and beautiful artwork - the humans are realistic enough and the dragons look very original. Story development is well-paced and seems to follow through with a climax and conclusion. The ending was satisfying. I mean, it wasn't as unrealistic as to have everybody come out alive and jumping around, but it wasn't so tragic that all the babies in the theatre would start crying. And, it wrapped up nicely without leaving any obvious gaps. Characters were stereotypical and easy to understand. I wished there was more character development of the sidekick kids such as Astrid and Snoutlout. It would have been interesting to know a bit more about them. I also wish there was a story behind Hiccup's mother.Music was nice, charming and sound effects really hit the spot. The dragon noises were realistic, and Toothless' was so adorable!My favourite part of the movie was the relationship between Hiccup and Toothless. When I saw that dragon on posters and in trailers, I was horrified to see that its face was non-scary and even a little bit salamander-like. However Toothless is actually very very adorable and cute! I like the emphasis on themes such as friendship among species, father to son relationships, justice, being different, and many others. Overall, this movie will thrill both the young and the old alike. In addition, How to Train Your Dragon is an excellent movie for people who are looking for a good dragon-themed movie! Yay! (No more vampires!)9.5/10"
"The right combination of an appropriately awkward protagonist, a clever script with not a single pop culture reference, and truly remarkable animation (including 3-d flying scenes that trump anything in Avatar), made this flick a blast from start to finish. A group of Scottish(??) Vikings live on a small island, stubbornly rebuilding their wooden homes after they are burned to the ground by the islands other inhabitants: dragons of myriad shapes and sizes that steal their sheep and raze their village. Over and over again. Beefcake adults with proved mettle act as dragon slayers, fighting off the scourge. The young, gangly Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel) aspires, in his way, to join their ranks and prove himself to his father and Chief, Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler). Short of brawn but heavy on brains, Hiccup invents a catapult type device, which he uses to bring down the legendary Night Fury, a dragon so notoriously fast and deadly that they've never even been seen with the naked eye. When he finds the fallen dragon, injured and helpless in the tangles of his trap, Hiccup cannot bring himself to slay it and instead sets it free, thus starting one of the most endearing ""boy and his pet"" relationships in movie history. That night, two hearts change - Hiccup decides he doesn't want to become a slayer, while Stoick decides Hiccup deserves a chance. His father's will too strong, Hiccup reluctantly begins slayer training, where he will learn to bring down - and kill - the beasts. The story is simple and straightforward; a zero-to-hero tale with few surprises (think Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs, Disney's Hercules, or the on-the-nose straight to video sequel Hercules: Zero to Hero). But the strength of the characters, humour of the script, and more importantly the remarkable execution of flying and dragon vs. dragon fight scenes make the film enjoyable throughout. Hiccup is an endearing protagonist, appealing to teen awkwardness and a desire for acceptance from both peers and family. The supporting cast is a good mix of headstrong and suitably jerky-come-friendly teenagers, while Stoick, as his name might suggest, is a strong but distant patriarch, making for one of the funniest ""good talk"" scenes between father and son. The dragons are by far the best part of the film, which offers up a half-dozen or so of uniquely characterized beasts, including a two headed menace with one head that spews gas and another that acts as pilot light, and a giant spindly red dragon that tends to set itself on fire. Hiccup's pet dragon, dubbed Toothless (for his retractable razor sharp teeth), is clearly modeled after your dog (and everyone else's) and his puppy-like naiveté trapped in a sleek, pebbled, 30 foot frame will strike a chord with all pet owners. Oh, and he's also a major bad-ass black dragon that you can ride and he has laser-precise blue fireball action and is capable of speeds likely measured in ""Mach""s and you want one. The flying scenes in this film are captivating and fun and represent some of the most engaging use of 3D technology I've seen. How to Train Your Dragon is pure vicarious wish fulfillment, watering a seed planted in older viewers by The Never Ending Story, and likely planting one in younger viewers too young to remember Atreyu and Falkor. Endearing, enchanting, and engaging, a fun movie for anyone who ever wanted to ride a dragon. 8/10"
"I just don't know how to say about this movie! This is absolutely the best animated feature of the year! The plot, characters, visual effects are so amazing.The plot was simple and not complicated. But very touching, indeed. Dragons rarely seen on cartoon, today. But this one did a great job on creating a world where Vikings vs Dragons and making people moved by the relationship of the characters.The characters were well-made and beautiful, I love not only their appearance but also...themselves. Especially the dragons, they are very cute, indeed. They make me wish I could ride dragons one day.I'm definitely sure that this movie will make you wish it would been longer. You'll want to see more! And I hope they will make a sequel, but this original is so great that I can watch it again and again.Last but not least, I hope this film will get some Oscar nominees and win! Go watch it and you see. Enjoy your watching."
"I did not have much expectation when i went for this movie. Once it started, i knew i am gonna like it. The story is kinda different and i loved the animation, texturing and cinematography. Though the movie was just 1hr 30mins, felt long enough and story was complete and nothing untold. Set in the mythical world of Vikings and Dragons, tell the story of Hiccup who actually does n fit much with his tribe who are dragon slayers. His world changes wen he meets a dragon which ends up his tribe people to see everything in a different point of view. Dream-works did n disappoint us !! And how can i forget about the Stereoscopic Dreamworks Logo !!! awesome So .. Don miss it !!!!!!"
"How to Train Your Dragon is a fine animated excursion into mamby pamby land for children but it is not so inane as to drive adults nuts. Those less critical of movies will certainly enjoy the film a great deal more than I did, but it is a fine movie none the less.Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) is a scrawny and geeky Viking whose father is chief dragon slayer of the clan. Try as he might Hiccup can't seem to do anything right and his attempts to prove himself backfire and make things worse for everyone. He reminds me very much of Flik, the main character A Bug's Life. Both are misfits looking for approval and eventually they win acceptance by having a series of adventures where they learn to be themselves and teach a valuable lesson to the rest of the clan/colony.Hiccup's adventure involves a dragon he manages to bring down with one of his quirky inventions. Nobody believes him so he sets off in search of the dragon so he can slay it and win approval from his father and the rest of the village. He finds himself unable to do the deed and ultimately ends up befriending the dragon, which acts in much the same manner as a house cat. His experiences with the dragon allow Hiccup to gain valuable insights into the nature of the ferocious beasts, it turns out they are more like dogs and cats than flying lizards. The story is rather formulaic but it is cute, which is pretty much what you are looking for in this type of movie.There are several animated movies of a similar nature that I liked more than How to Train Your Dragon, Monsters, Inc. and The Incredibles come to mind, but it is still a movie that is probably worth watching, especially if you have children. I promise they will love the film and it won't leave you wanting to claw your eyes out, in fact, you will probably like it too."
"When i first saw this film at the cinema i thought it had no heart and was quite shallow. The thing that annoyed me was that this son of the chief spoke in an American accent when everyone else (apart from some teens) spoke in a Scottish accent, they all should have had one type of accent. But after watching it a second time i saw the heart of the story and the emotion between Toothless and Hiccup. It is very uplifting and so enjoyable to watch. I live Toothless, he's just plain cool and cute, i want a dragon like that one!!! But i think the journey Hiccup takes is extraordinary and its great to see how he grows in confidence but still remains the down to earth kid that we see at the beginning and he doesn't loose that quality through the film. It had humorous moments in with some of the characters which kept the spirit up in this film. The ending is very uplifting and i wonder how they are going to follow on with a sequel which is planned to be released in 2013. The CGI is amazing, it's so polished and modern and it feels fresh. I do think that if you don't like this film at first, at least watch it again and you'll love it soon enough, i'm sure of it. DreamWorks have hit a goldmine with this one."
"There's lots of very dynamic exciting action in this movie and it's mostly done with a cheerful fun tone most of the time even though there's still danger. However, despite that lack of ""realism"", I do think that adults will enjoy it a lot too. The story is not the most original (except for the original premise) but it's very well told, with good character development and has a fairly good morale for those into that. The effects and animation is stunning. Very well done.The story was entertaining to watch and it didn't really drag on like other animated films. One thing I didn't really like, is that there's a part of the ending that we've seen a hundred times before especially in kids movies and I would have preferred a little more originality there or at least see it better done because I didn't really buy into it. Very clichéd and should have been better in my opinion"
"One of the best animated movies I have ever seen.. I can easily compare this with any of the top animated movies out there including monsters inc., UP, Wall-e, kungfu panda and cloudy with chances of meatballs.. It reminds me a portion of avatar in which there was a dragon taming scene.. Character development was extremely strong with a strong focus on script and storyline.. Graphics are pretty much amazing and credit goes to dreamworks for maintaining their top of class animation.I won't go into details, but after cloudy with chances of meatballs, this is the latest animated movie that not only amazes me, but also keeps my 2 and 3 year sons to stick to the seat until the movie ends.."
"I'm beginning to think that the people who make CGI features have got it pegged a lot better than those who make live action movies. So often they seem to have a good story, an excellent script, cracking characterisation, and fabulous visuals.How To Train Your Dragon is no exception.Hiccup is the son of Viking chief Stoick, whose village is beset by dragons which steal the livestock. Hiccup is a disappointment to his father, especially when he doesn't take the same warlike approach to dragon-slaying classes as his contemporaries. But then Hiccup begins to be able to deal with the dragons better than the other youngsters, because he has secretly befriended an injured dragon.This is an outcast story, dealing with a youngster who is alienated, but has the strength of character to stick to his guns in the face of pressure from all sides to conform. But it is also an exciting adventure story with a great deal of humour. The characters are engaging and well-drawn (in the dramatic sense, although they also look good).And the movie looks great. The locations are stunning, the animation is first rate, and 3D is very well used (focus pulls, in particular, work very well in 3D).And, more than anything else, there were big, big chunks of this film where it just got hold of me almost physically (and certainly emotionally) and took me on Hiccup's journey with him. Possibly a little intense for younger children, this is a great family film. I loved it."
"First off, did you like Shrek? Finding Nemo? If you like an animated movie with a wonderful story that delves into character development, then How to Train Your Dragon is for you. How to Train Your Dragon is the best family animated film I have seen in a long, long time. The characters are wonderfully written. We see the friendship between Hiccup (the main character) and Toothless (the dragon) develop through their awkwardness, fear of each other (at first) and their attempts to understand one another. We see the story of a young viking who does not fit in being able to use his other gifts to become a viable part of his society. The film is well written overall. It has some of the standards outcast type situations, but those are the things that make outcast movies so endearing. The film looks marvelous. How to Train Your Dragon uses the 3D element very well and creates a beautiful world for the story to grow within. Highly recommended."
"How To Train Your Dragon (Imax, 3-D, 1:38, PG) — Other: Adventure, 2nd string, originalIt's taken a quarter of a year for 2010 to produce an SF&F movie that I can honestly recommend, but it is my pleasure to be able to do so for How To Train Your Dragon, an Imax 3-D offering from DreamWorks Animation. It's by the same creative team that did Lilo & Stitch, and the 1st sight of the eponymous dragon should give you a frisson of déjà vu if you saw that little delight back in 2002.The story opens with a voice-over narration from a character we will soon meet, Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), son of Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler, and that's pronounced ""stoic"", not ""stoyk""), leader of a viking village that's beset with what Hiccup understatedly calls a pest problem. As he mentions this, 1 of the 2 sheep contentedly grazing before us suddenly gets snatched away by a barely seen dark shape from above. Yes, it turns out that the ""pests"" are dragons. The village has been there for 7 generations, but Hiccup notes that all the houses are brand new, and we shortly see why, as flaming dragon breath takes out several of them. Still, the tribe soldiers on. ""We're vikings"", Hiccup tells us. ""We have stubbornness issues.""We finally see Hiccup himself, a toothpick of a lad, being chivvied by his hugely burly elders into the cover of the town smithy, where he's apprenticed to Gobber (Craig Ferguson). Hiccup is in his early teens and wants to prove himself a fighter, but it's quickly apparent that he's more adept at draftsmanship, creative thinking, and gadgetry. (I also note, with some pride, that he's a fellow left-hander.) He's rigged up a net-casting trebuchet, and he thinks he's winged one of the overflying dragons, but it didn't fall anywhere near the village, and without the corpus delicti everyone razzes him about his claim to have bagged a rare Night Fury breed — the kind that's never seen ... and never misses.The foregoing is about the 1st 7 minutes of the movie, and the rest is equally densely packed. I'm not going to go into any more detail, because there are several twists and turns that you really need to see to appreciate. However, given the film's title, it's hardly giving anything away to mention that Hiccup sets out the following day to look for his downed dragon and discovers him very much alive but hobbled, trapped in a rock-walled glen, and desperate for succor. He's been told ""A dragon will always, always go for the kill!"" ""So why didn't you?"" he muses, as he hauls a load of fish to his new-found friend.We discover that there are many different kinds of dragons, from the bloated, buffoonish Grundle that serves as the Read Me file for the dragon-fighting trainees up to the Monstrous Nightmare, only a notch below the Night Fury in awesomeness. They are all wonderfully rendered in their splendid variety, just a visual treat. Nor does the eyefeast end there. This is a gorgeous movie, resplendent with color and natural beauty. Billowing cloudscapes and scenes of flight into the aurora borealis are glorious.The hero is plucky, resourceful, and resilient, and so is Astrid (America Ferrera), the blond viking lass who's the tuffest kid in town but also the most empathetic. The old man is gruff, inarticulate, and set in his ways (that would be the old ways), but he dearly loves his misfit son and wishes only the best for him; he's also one hell of a warrior.For some odd reason, all the kids speak colloquial English, but all the adults have a thick Scottish brogue — no hint of Scandinavia in any of it. Perhaps that's yet another wrinkle in the movie's offbeat sense of humor, which is never thigh-slappingly hilarious but produces plenty of smiles and grins.This is anything but a ""message"" movie, but there are lessons to be learned from it. They're like the medicine hidden in the spoonful of sugar. You get better while feeling good about it. Yum!"
"This story captivated me from the get-go. From the moment we see Hiccup take down Toothless, I was enthralled with the story. Characterization was excellent by all the voice-actors and animators. But it was and is the story that really makes this movie worth the price of a theater ticket. As the story moves forward, Hiccup's growing friendship with Toothless along with the expectations of his tribe known really keeps a viewer on the edge of their seat wondering what will happen next. The revelations in the film about the dragons pull at one's emotions. One theme that runs throughout the story is the concept of overcoming prejudice. Hiccup is perceived by everyone as ""the useless"" and the dragons as vicious beasts that the vikings should always ""kill on sight"". As the story progresses those perceptions change -- first the villager's perception of Hiccup and then the error of everything the viking's supposedly ""knew"" about their supposed enemies -- making it all look like foolishness in the end. And the resolution definitely makes you smile. The STORY is what really makes this movie."
"Up until Shrek Dreamworks wasn't making great animated films and then that green ogre came along and change that. Shrek was most definitely my favourite Dramworks film, that is until i saw this. The vibrant colours and the stunning animation really captivated me and the music made the experience even more gratifying. Yes there were a few flaws, as their are with any film but this is most definitely as close to ""Pixar Perfection"" as Dreamworks will ever get. If your a fan of very funny, action packed, sort of emotion then go and see this film, i am serious drop what ever your doing now and get down to the cinema! It might not be as heart warming as Toy Story or as tear jerking as UP but it will most certainly give Pixar a run for its money in the action department. A most satisfying whole and this years best animated film, until Toy Story 3 that is!"
"""How to Train your Dragon"" is the latest digital animation movie from DreamWorks Animation studios (the same studio that produced the Shrek movies, ""Kung Fu Panda,"" and ""Bee Movie""). The movie starts off with the narration of the main character, Hiccup (his name is explained in the movie), voiced by Jay Baruchel, describing his Viking hometown and the problems they have with dragons. The audience is thrust into an elaborate action sequence of dragons attacking Hiccup's village. This opening scene does justice to the advancements in digital animation and explores some inventive camera shots of the action and its characters.Young Hiccup wants to be a dragon fighter and have the chance to kill his first dragon. Why does he want to kill a dragon? It means he will be respected among his fellow Vikings. He has one big size issue though, considering the average Viking is four times his size, no one takes him seriously. Villagers ridicule his size often. He resorts to using his intelligence to solve his problems (it seems that for such a young mind he knows quite a bit about aerodynamic engineering). One of his inventions takes down a dreaded night fury dragon. Yet no one believes Hiccup is worthy of being a dragon slayer.The movie moves along smoothly with more being revealed about Hiccup and his situation. Turns out the head of village is also his dad, Stoick, voiced by Gerard Butler. Here is the setup of the traditional kids' movie story line where the child tries to prove himself to his father and/or mother. And yes, we have seen it before and the story is pretty formulaic, but this story does have emotion and well-written dialogue to keep the audience's interest.Hiccup ventures into the woods to find and slay the dragon he had taken down earlier only to find that he cannot kill the dragon. He eventually befriends the beast and learns the traits of the dragon species. There is a humorous and touching development between the boy and the dragon. Toothless (that's Hiccup's name for the new friend) has mood swings from a Clint Eastwood toughness to a Bambie-like curiosity and friendliness. The directors, Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders (both of ""Mulan"" and ""Lilo and Stitch"" fame), put it together to make this friendship work so it doesn't come off too cheesy.Stoick eventually enrolls Hiccup into a dragon slaying class in the village. In the class, fellow village adolescents learn the proper Viking way to kill different varieties of dragons. What develops is the conflict within Hiccup – should he kill the dragons or should he befriend them? The imagery of the movie is outstanding. The art directors took their time and added the details in the background shots. The water and the fire caught my attention because those elements looked real. I also noticed the hair of the characters (I know I am nitpicking, but in a good way). Considering the era and primitive ways of the Vikings, I could see that their hair was chopped off with a knife. The villagers obviously didn't have a village barber shop. They simply cut their hair with what was available to them. It's a small detail I know, but little things like that made the movie feel realistic.Should you see this movie? Yes, it's a good kid's movie with only a few hidden adult jokes. The action will keep it together and hold your interest until the end. The kids will like the different varieties of dragons and most likely relate to one of the adolescent characters. To paraphrase my 10-year-old daughter — it is a good family story that is funny and yet scary at times (she was referring to the action sequences, but in a good way). One more thing, I saw the movie in 2D and I still feel it was great. Try seeing it in its 3D format; it almost has to be better."
"Before I start, let me first say that I walked into the cinema to watch How To Train Your Dragon with no expectations at all. Dreamworks have been going downhill since Shrek 2 and the title of this film, coupled with a huge 3D printed next to it, failed to get my hopes up too much either. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this is Dreamworks best film since Shrek 2, but then I realised that Dreamworks haven't made a good animation since Shrek 2. Oh dear.After a fairly dull opening, we eventually get to the main story of the film which is about a young boy befriending a dragon which is meant to be the enemy of his people. In fact, it's a lot like Avatar in this regard. The boy in question is Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), son of the chieftain Stoick (Gerard Butler) of the island village Berk. Dragons attack said village and Hiccup manages to take down one known as Night-Fury. Rather than finish the job though, the boy befriends the dragon and is able to get to the top of his dragon training class ahead of his classmate Astrid (America Ferrera). Other classmates include Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Jonah Hill.Already you can tell that the story is rather contrived and predictable with the only moment of true originality and laugh out loud hilarity coming in the opening scene in which dragons are burning down a village whilst Baruchel, Mintz-Plasse and Hill narrate over the top of it as if it's a perfectly normal thing to happen and they complain about their boring lives. Trust me, it will make all but the dullest of people laugh.It's not just the script that feels a bit contrived though. The directors Chris Sandler and Dean Deblois previously worked on Lilo and Stitch and it clearly shows because the dragon may as well be Stitch. The Scottish accents throughout the film all sound like Mike Myers from Shrek except a million times worse. Just get some real Scotsman for God's sake, why is Jay Baruchel playing a Scottish kid!? Just so Dreamworks can have a big name on the poster, JUST GET A REAL BLOODY SCOTSMAN! Actually, give them some credit they did get Gerard Butler and David Tennant but I still don't get the obsession with big A-listers in animated films.The moral message is also annoyingly unoriginal and so blatantly forced down the throat of the audience that I choked on my popcorn. How many times to kids need to learn the values of accepting outsiders and being nice to your father? The big surprise to me though was that the 3D was actually pretty damn good. The action sequences were also surprisingly well done for an animated film and these were (along with the funny opening I previously mentioned) easily the stand out moments from the film. It's definitely the best looking and most vibrant animation I've seen from Dreamworks.How To Train Your Dragon is not a terrible film. It's funny in parts and looks great in 3D with some really excellent action sequences. However, it's so contrived and forgettable that I really don't think Pixar need to worry. They've still got the animation crown and Dreamworks are showing no signs of grabbing it away from them.2/5"
"(Credit IMDb) Long ago up North on the Island of Berk, the young Viking, Hiccup, wants to join his town's fight against the dragons that continually raid their town. However, his macho father and village leader, Stoik the Vast, will not allow his small, clumsy, but inventive son to do so. Regardless, Hiccup ventures out into battle and downs a mysterious Night Fury dragon with his invention, but can't bring himself to kill it. Instead, Hiccup and the dragon, whom he dubs Toothless, begin a friendship that would open up both their worlds as the observant boy learns that his people have misjudged the species. But even as the two each take flight in their own way, they find that they must fight the destructive ignorance plaguing their worldHow to Train Your Dragon was a cute Animated movie, and considering the fact I'm picky on animated movies, that is a big compliment. However, how on earth did this get into the top 250? It's like Toy Story 3, clearly inferior to the first two, yet it gets voted in. Criticism aside, I really liked the story in this one. For starters, the name ""Hiccup"" for a lead is ingenious, and Baruchel performs the voice well. The relationship with the Dragon is what obviously makes the movie though. It's cute, believable, and a good story for the kids to get into. Also thought the ending was heart-felt, and well told. It's enjoyable as a movie viewing experience, but it's not as good as people like you to believe it is, in my opinion.Bottom line. I enjoyed this, I really did. It's cute, harmless, and it passed the time perfectly. Who knows, if more enjoyable ones come out like this is the animated genre, I might just get back into them like I used too. Don't expect a masterpiece, and you'll have a good time. Recommended 7/10"
"Let me think - the 3D was better, the plot more interesting, the characters more compelling and the conclusion more satisfying, in every way a better, more original movie than the ""King of the World's Ferngully."" This time we actually got to root for the humans - a novel concept.The movie follows a misfit boy as he turns from a laughing stock of the town and he grows into the only person who seems to be able to get the dragons to do as he wants. There are many things to like about this movie and very little not to like.The movie was not pretentious...not full of itself just well made entertainment. I recommend this highly!"
Great story and amazing animation are only 2 of the reasons why this movie is one of the best animated movies to date. I loved every second of it and I believe anyone will at least have a great time watching this movie.
I OFFICIALLY WANT A PET DRAGON. I literally fell in love with the Dragon that it feels that his (yes I said his) character arc is even deeper than the main character's. 10/10 no thought about it.
"In my opinion the best animation movie I have ever seen and it could easily score 10 out of 10, silly as it sounds I only gave it a 9 so I had wiggle room for the sequel.Jay Baruchel, who has done some decent movies, does the voice of Hiccup to perfection. The whole movie really revolves around Hiccup and Toothless, his young dragon. As one other reviewer stated, Toothless exhibits masses of personality and is like a huge lovable puppy. Being able to display this level of personality without uttering a single word is beyond impressive.The addition of romance, comedy and action galore makes this a movie for all the family as I assume was Dreamworks aim.This is truly a fun movie that has to be seen to be believed.9/10"
"Now that's more like it! Last July, after I heralded Inception and Toy Story 3 as rescuing 2010 moviegoers from a year otherwise bereft of great storytelling, I received an email from a Dreamworks animator pointing me in the direction of How to Train Your Dragon. Word of mouth had been positive, but I had yet to check it out. Dreamworks Animation (Shrek, Over the Hedge, Monsters vs. Aliens) is known for targeting the funny bone of children and adults alike, but with the exception of Kung-Fu Panda, making films with heart and a spirit of adventure to match the humor hasn't seemed to be their priority.With How to Train Your Dragon, however, Dreamworks has raised their standard, making the race for Best Animated Feature at this year's Oscars much more interesting. Combining truly stunning visuals with well-rounded characters, Dragon doesn't insult the intelligence of young viewers. It is moving and uplifting, thrilling and funny, and uses its fantasy story to explore profound themes of prejudice, searching for personal identity, and longing for acceptance by a parent. If this sounds heavy, don't worry: you'll have a great time, and the action is pretty terrific. Listen for a great turn by Gerard Butler as a Viking father."
