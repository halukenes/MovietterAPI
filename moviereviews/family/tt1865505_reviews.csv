"I guess the title kind of gives it away, doesn't it? Still, I'm not one who's given to hyperbole when describing movies, and I'm enough of a critic that I want to nitpick to insane degrees from time to time, but I just can't do it with Song of the Sea. There's just nothing to point out.This movie is from the same studio that brought us The Secret of Kells (2009), an almost beguilingly charming movie that brought together elements of Druidic myth, passionate Christian faith, history, and Celtic grandeur in a way that I don't think anyone had ever really seen before. When a studio with such a good first effort under their belt takes five years to come out with a second film, you can bet that it's because they're doing something magical.The only real comparison that's able to be drawn is to the work of Hayao Miyazaki, simply because there's not another animated filmmaker out there who's as honest and earnest with their culture's folklore to compare to. Where Miyazaki-san's work is steeped in spiritual fantasy and a love for his home country not really seen since the Romantic movement, Tomm Moore is a bit more grounded in Western storytelling and keeps his myths well interacted with daily life. His stories are a whimsical blend of magic and the mundane, and it's all carried so well that you wish it could all be true.The story of Saoirse and her brother Ben is cut from the classic Hero's Journey so closely that you can practically see Joseph Campbell's fingerprints on the screen. In the back of my mind, I was pointing out each and every plot point as it went by, like an eager sightseer out the side of a tour bus. While the story is formulaic, sure, it's executed brilliantly and engagingly. As we so often forget; Tropes Are Not Bad. It's fantastic to see the tools of storytelling so perfectly implemented. It's like watching a master painter or musician craft their art.Speaking of which, Song of the Sea doesn't lack for anything in the artistic departments. The visuals are jaw-droppingly beautiful, simplistic in design, true to the Celtic roots of the story, and should almost be listed as a character in and of themselves. This story simply couldn't have been told as well with a different art crew, the dynamic is so tied into the feel and flow of the tale. The score is, similarly, simplistic and heartfelt. It doesn't overshadow anything. There's no bombast or leitmotif to be found, but the music is so integral to the plot that you can't imagine the movie without it. Or not even with more of it, the balance is so fine.And to cap it all off, the voice acting is absolutely brilliant. This is what I long to hear, a return to the days when people were matched to roles that they could play, not a parade of Hollywood ""talent"" who tries to buy viewers with recognition and star power. Song of the Sea is loaded with people who can actually ACT in their voices alone, and from the adults straight down to the child actors who play the roles of the protagonist pair, every one is a standout.Honestly, I haven't seen an animated film this heartfelt and earnest since The Lion King, which is probably one of the last times that a studio really just threw their cards on the table and said ""let's see what we can really do to tell a story"". Song of the Sea hasn't and won't gross well at the box office by Hollywood standards - which is a true shame, because I can't think of a film from 2014 that more deserves to be seen."
"Song of the Sea is perhaps known best for being one of the films nominated for the Best Animated Feature Oscar, and after seeing the film it's easy to see why. It's a beautiful and enchanting film, and one of the strongest of the nominees of what was mostly a solid line-up (one where even the weakest of the nominees, The Boxtrolls, had a lot of fine things about it). And as well-done a film The Secret of Kells is, to me Song of the Sea is the superior film, having connected more with the story.Song of the Sea is so wonderfully animated, the character designs have a real charm without being too cute or stereotyped, but even better are the breathtakingly beautiful colours and very handsomely detailed and at its best magical background art. The music score is equally striking, the melancholic and lilting Celtic sound fitting so well and hauntingly with the story's emotional mood. The film contains a beautifully written script, thoughtful, poignant and with many nuances.That the story was so easy to connect with was yet another thing that Song of the Sea excelled so well at, it doesn't try to do too much, for one as layered and rich as this one, nor does it feel too slight for the running time. The atmosphere is enchanting, but it was the emotional impact that was even more resonant, it is a subject very easy to identify with and the most emotional parts were just heart-breaking. The characters are interesting and engaging, Ben starts off a little stereotypical but goes through a significant amount of character growth throughout the film that it becomes far easier to warm to him. The voice work is fine, with an admirably nimble Brendan Gleeson and a charming and emotive Lucy O'Connell being particularly strong while David Rawle portrays Ben's development and emotions very believably as well.All in all, outstanding film and really does cast an enchantingly intoxicating spell on anyone who has the fortune to watch it. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"From the Academy Award-nominated director of The Secret of Kells ""Tomm Moore""This visually stunning animation masterwork, steeped in Irish myth, folklore and legend,Perfect balance of fantasy & real life.A sweet journey of love and loss through Celtic mythology with a unique animation style that I've come to love,Song Of The Sea is a triumph in design and animation,The story was rich and quite impressive as well but after you see this film you'll be thinking about how amazing and beautiful it was.Song Of The Sea gets a 10/10 from me and is well worth to be seen in theaters."
"Our story begins with a pregnant mother giving her first-born son Ben – a young boy – a conch shell so that he can hear the sea and be reminded of the mystical Irish folktales she has shared with him. When she disappears into the sea after giving birth to a daughter Saoirse ('Seer-Sha'), the story fast-forwards 6 years into the future where we find a broken family. The father and devoted lighthouse-keeper (voiced by Brendan Gleeson) is distraught and empty after the loss of his wife, Saoirse has yet to utter a word and is thought to be mute, and Ben would sooner be in the company of his loyal dog Cu than mind his little sister like he is supposed to.The night their meddling grandmother comes to try and take the children away to the city, young Saoirse is led by an illuminating force to a coat among her absent-mother's belongings and subsequently wanders into the ocean where she is transformed into a seal. We later find out that she is part selkie – a magical being that is capable of such transformation. Finding her human again and washed up along the beach asleep (and having come down with a cold), the grandmother sees no alternative other than to 'rescue' the children from such a hostile environment and proceeds to take Ben and Saoirse to Dublin. Disheartened by their new home, the children quickly escape on a journey to find their way back to their father and the lighthouse. Along the way, Ben and Saoirse find themselves engulfed in many of the same fantastical stories their mother always talked about. Additionally Saoirse discovers her ability to tune into the spirit realm and nature through her gifts as a selkie and with the help Ben's conch shell.It's a story of love that is infused with rich mythology and folklore. Beautiful is a term that I seldom get to use as a cinephile, but beautiful is the only word I can use to describe Song of the Sea. Director/writer Tomm Moore has created a wondrous and vibrant style that immediately calls to mind the works of Hayao Miyazaki that Moore has cited as his personal inspiration. Whereas Miyazaki draws upon the wealth of his Japanese heritage to create internationally acclaimed works such as Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke, Moore celebrates the folk stories of his native Ireland as he did in his 2009 Oscar nominated film The Secret of Kells. With Song of the Sea, we get tales of spirits, selkies, fairies and the like that seems as if they've been immortally captured in a children's storybook and jazzed up with a modern family drama. Moore's animations are infused with Celtic designs and an eerie mysticism that seem as if a painting has come to life before your eyes. There is something absolutely enchanting in the way Moore and his animation company Cartoon Saloon are able to use traditional animation to tell such a compelling story. The characters are engaging and the story is both poignant and inspiring, but the real beauty in this film is the swirling palettes of color that captivate the audience with each passing frame. Set aside all that digital garbage and be refreshed by a style of animation that is truly magical.I tried to think of the perfect descriptor for this film, but the best I could come up with is to liken it to the equally beautiful film Pan's Labyrinth if it were a Studio Ghibli film. It has dark elements, a timeless and engrossing story, and an aesthetic mastery that will see you through these otherwise barren months of cinema.Read the full review and others like it on the Drive-in Zeppelin website"
"The songs and the music is so magical it takes you so deep in the ocean and so high up the Irish highlands traditional stories.The Oscar nomination was no foul, for me it is as good as Big Hero 6 but maybe the latter has more Action,, yet the storyline and plot here is tighter and more intriguing.There were some Irish sentences where i'm lost .. couldn't get few words ;) :D but i lived for a while up in Glasgow, Scotland so i kinda got used to these mysteriously ""charming"" accents ;)Don't keep your emotions sealed in jars :) It's been really so long since i'v watched an Animated movie with so much heightened emotions :) In the final scene i really felt like crying ...Overall it's recommended , hope you enjoy it guys ;)"
"Amazing artwork and amazing story! I must say this movie has a story to tell that will work up to your emotion just like sea touching a stone and fills it with life. Music is great! The use of color and environment is so vivid and well thought. ""Song of the sea"" takes you into a emotional and adventurous journey with Saoirse and Ben. I strongly recommend to watch this animated movie. If you are a fan of animation you will simply love it. I've watched quite a lot of work of Studio Ghibli. 2D work like this is rare to come by these days. Wonderful creation! You should make movies like this and unlock a part of us which has been lost in the waves of time. Thank you. :)"
"Whenever I see a movie like this, it makes me wish that 3D animation was not so dominate in popularity.Ben is a small boy who goes on a journey with his sister, Saoirse to reunited her with the last gift their mother granted her before passing, which will give her the ability to sing a song that can save all the creatures from their mother's fairy tales.The Irish are rich with stories and fairy tales of mythical creatures. It was awesome to see one of those takes come to life in the most beautiful animation.So well done, it was like a painting coming to life.This was one of the best animated movies I see in a while. I can see how it was nominated for an Oscar. Absolutely worth watching."
"When one loses their feelings, they risk turning to stone. Selkies, magical beings that change from seals to humans, have the power to reverse such changes. This is because selkies are in touch with nature, love and the ancient way of things. However, selkies cannot make the changes by themselves. They need help from humans. A little girl, Saoirse, is a selkie. Saoirse attempts to keep her family from turning to stone. Her family is prone to grief and selfishness. They do not reveal their hearts to others. Saoirse's task becomes all the more difficult when her mother, also a selkie, strangely disappears in the night. And through no fault of her own, Saoirse's voice vanishes as well. On top of this, strangers who already lost their emotions for good, try to make Saoirse lose hope. Will her father, older brother and grandmother, all preoccupied with their own concerns, help or turn away? The beautiful, spell binding and intricate animation of this film includes the Northern lights, sunrises and surreal underwater worlds. The singular theme of the film underscores the truth that stories, emotions, animals and nature connect us to our better selves and to each other. From the director of the spectacular, award winning Secret of Kells. Seen at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival."
It is generally accepted that only Disney can do animation with strong musical themes. Wrong.It is generally accepted that only Japan can produce superior animation.Wrong.It is generally accepted that FINDING NEMO was the best animated story about the sea.Wrong.The other IMDb reviewer who said this could be the best animated feature ever made may not be wrong. It is one of a kind.I could go on but hopefully you get the point.Wonderful. Enchanting. Magical. Perfect.I couldn't even hit the PAUSE button.
"""My son, remember me in your stories and in your songs. Know that I will always love you, always."" Mother BronaghA good kids' animation will usually include some well-known motifs such as in Hansel and Gretel and The Wizard of Oz; Tomm Moore's Song of the Sea does. However, this is no ordinary animation: It swirls with pastels that morph into imaginative lines capturing humans and faeries as if the world supported both in their glory and despair--a phantasmagoric hot mess if you will. As he did in his first spectacular animation, the Secret of Kells, Moore hand draws (without the aid of computer) a maritime story about Ireland, not some nebulous Neverland.Despite the imaginative, albeit almost primitive visuals, the story hammers home some important themes, especially for kids: the challenges of an older brother with a younger sister and the loss of a parent inducing depression to cause muteness. In addition, the interaction of a domineering grandma with small children plays a part as the filmmakers accurately target the challenges of growing up for any child.In this Oscar-nominated tale set in 1987, Saoirse (voice of Lucy O'Connell), a mute child living in a lighthouse with her tormenting older brother, suffers the loss of mother, who is actually one of the Selkies (women in Scottish and Irish legend who change from seals to people while hiding their sealness). So, too, little Selkie Saoirse, who struggles to bring back mother from the sea and deal with grumpy grandma at the same time.Saoirse's responsibility is to save all the fairy creatures from the modern world. Besides meeting an array of eccentric characters, she helps her bro learn to love her, and dad to accept the loss of his wife. If the story is not new enough for you, then relax with visuals that will hypnotize in their simplicity of execution and complexity of theme.Then you can also consider how this 6 million dollar movie beats the heck out of major studio productions costing twenty times that."
"A vacation to a recurring place, like that cabin in the mountains you visit once a year, is one of those nostalgic memories that you treasure so much that you'll try hard to recreate it when your turn comes to be a parent. For most, there are either mountain people or beach people; one set enjoys the sea air and playing in the sand while there are those that prefer the smell of pine and the wide openness of nature. I've had the privilege to have both, though I consider myself more of a beach guy.One place that my parents would take my brother and I (and still do to this day) is the lovely Laguna Beach. The conflicting scents of sunscreen and ocean water give me such a relaxing buzz that I can't help but feel that the sea itself calls to me. Being about to observe the tide corals and touch them, as well as sticking my feet in the water just seems to define Southern California. It's such a laid back atmosphere and it's something that I hope to observe more in the future. The call of the ocean is the subject in Song of the Sea. It's set in Ireland where we find a family living on an island in a lighthouse where a young boy named Ben loves his life with his lighthouse keeper father and his mother whose ready to give birth to a daughter. One night she disappears into the sea but the daughter is born safely. The father becomes distant from his kids out of guilt that he couldn't have saved his wife, leaving young Ben to care for his sister. Six years later, the girl, named Saoirse, has yet to speak and easily frustrates Ben as he's remained fearful of the ocean water and forbids her to enter it. The two are your typical brother sister set who tend to fight and play pranks on each other, even though Ben is usually the troublemaker. Their grandmother comes to visit on Saoirse's birthday and tries again to persuade her son to let the grandkids come live with her. Things seem to go fine until Saoirse finds her mothers seashell that was given to Ben. She finds that when she plays it, a magical force leads her to find a coat where upon wearing in the sea, will allow her to turn into a seal. The incident convinces the father the kids might be better off and send them to their grandmother. The kids don't like the arrangement and set off to return to the lighthouse while coming across some other mysterious Celtic legends. The team behind this picture also made the previously Oscar nominated Secret of the Kells. As with their last film, Song of the Sea is beautifully hand drawn, which is something we really need more of. Some say that computer animation is all what people want, but I think if marketed well, this would have done as well as a regular Disney movie (maybe not Frozen levels, but a lot).As a story, Song of the Sea is a nice coming of age story that nicely shows a genuine relationship of brother and sister. A lot of the brother-sister sets we see are usually fighting or really close, yet this one is a bit a both, and because of that, feels more real. I too would be just as stressed should my sibling have never talked. The legends of giants turning into stone islands, trolls living in cities and owl witches are fun to hear about and have a timeless quality that more Americans should hear about. That might be the Irish ancestry inside of me but what are young gonna do?I'll give this nine seashell flutes out of ten. Song of the Sea has plenty of mysterious fantasy without any unnecessary pandering that one might receive from Nickelodeon. This is a film a highly recommend to not just families, but to those that have had a sibling."
"It's so great that such a small film like this will now get seen because it got nominated for an Oscar, whereas if it had not it would've gone very much underseen. I have to start off by saying that while the voice acting here is decent (surprisingly a little underacting by Brendan Gleeson), the sound mixing and sound editing is truly spectacular. At times the sounds were so real that if I closed my eyes I would really believe I was near the ocean. The animation as well, for being an independent film, is truly beautiful. Simple, but the colors are really vivid and strong and they have a great effect. Overall, the film is just gentle and joyous and so hard to dislike. It's a bit light, but harmless."
"Director Tomm Moore's followup to his Oscar nominated debut The Secret  of Kells certainly has the potential to follow in its footsteps if it  can reach enough of an audience. Song of the Sea adapts the Selkie  legends and takes them one step further. I'm quite familiar with the  story having spent the last year of my degree writing a short film  about it, but Songsubverts the mythological and tells a sequel of  sorts. The story is essentially Beauty and the Beastplus The Little  Mermaid, wherein seals turn to women and fall in love with men on the  land, staying with them until they are called back to the sea.  Beginning at the end of the tale, the mother Selkie, who has wedded a  human fisherman and already had a baby boy with him, is pregnant once  more. About to give birth, she relents that she has to go back to sea  and sacrifices herself to leave a baby girl to the remaining family. It  jumps six years into the future. The older brother, Ben, resents his  younger and mute sister, Saoirse, for their mother having to leave them  for good. At odds between their home by the rough treacherous sea and  their fussy Grandma who wants them to live in the city, they're forced  away from their distraught father (voiced charmingly by Brendan  Gleeson) and their dog to live with her.  Immediately reluctant to settle, they begin their journey home and  discover that the ancient stories and characters their mother told them  are true. As a half-Selkie, Saoirse has the power to save a race of  trolls turned to stone, and Ben has the responsibility of making sure  she meets their goal. The theme is overt, bottling up emotions turns  you to stone, but the truth in that is powerful. There's a very  delicate storybook quality to the film. Perhaps mostly due to the  simplistic and now refreshing 2D animation style that glitters  beautifully with its swirls, but also in the episodic way the story  unfolds. It is quite pedestrian in its traditions and obviously  contrived in its storytelling, one ostensibly accessible for children,  but the emotional honesty and depth of the characters make it engaging.  It has at least a sprightly spirit of adventure.  Granted, side characters are often eccentric for the sake of being  eccentric. Though they do have the type of elasticity we haven't seen  since the Disney films of the 60s and 70s after they've become more  reserved in the 90s. The elegant style owes a debt to Ghibli films, but  I'm not a big fan of Hayao Miyasaki outside of his craft and I  preferred this more identifiable approach to the fantasy. Fortunately,  among all the fantastical elements it has a very grounded sense of  humour rather than an often irritatingly quirky one that a film like  Frozen boasts and it makes it a much easier film to invest in. With its  overwhelming ending, endearing characters, and lovely Celtic music,  Song Of The Sea a thoroughly pleasant and poignant experience. The film  won't be big enough to contend for the Oscar win, but with any luck  we'll see it on the shortlist and in the top five.  7/10"
"Song of the Sea is a singularly exceptional film. It hides complexity in both story and fabulous art behind a simple, beguiling tale of two children, Saoirse and Ben, their father, Connor, their mother Bronach, and a very adorable dog, Cu, who struggle to cope with loss, and find in magical realism a way to understand and find the world afresh.Using superb metaphors and meaning from Irish folktales and legends the film can be viewed on one level simply as an adventurous fairy tale set in modern times, but viewed deeply, it speaks deeply to the human condition; and for this viewer is one of the most singular films of the decade. It is fun, funny, and sorrowful and, importantly, as unpatronising as children themselves. It is totally suited to all ages, including very small children, who will adore the seals and Cu, and adults, and even teenagers, who may be enticed to see something more. It is this aspect of understanding the human condition in Tomm Moore's film that lifts it from another animated film to the absolute finest cinema. Yet he does so with such a light touch that many viewers will accept the magical realism and simply enjoy the charm and whimsy and be swept along. However, it also poignantly asks if happiness can exist without sorrow, and given the choice, would we want to live without either or both, and does so with some terrific touches. In addition, here is a world of sublime artistic technical skill and excellent voice acting - the film is hand-drawn and was 4 years in the making - the detailing with swirls and lines in the backgrounds and the tiny movements, while still keeping a simply line drawn animation, deserves multiple viewings. Tomm Moore has with this and Secret of Kells turned Irish animation into a world class powerhouse. This is not American or Japanese, Moore has successfully defined in two films, a unique approach that marries Celtic line art with simple 2D animation and a non-vibrant colour palette and has created a new school of animation.This is a great film - several critics pounced on Kells for a lack of a defined story, here they cannot possibly complain: the interweaving of Irish legends with the modern day, is both inspired and strong. Also strong is a wonderful sly sense of humour and real, not forced, emotion. It is both entertaining and deep - and works.Finally, it is the meaning and value of family and above all, the place of the mother, that makes Song of the Sea exceptional - I have seen few other film that explores loss with such wonderful metaphors as this, and certainly none as beautiful and with such a light touch as this. It is constantly surprising, full of wonder, and is, in the best sense, simply magical. Above all, it never defines where reality ends and magic begins and that is its real magic."
"Like most hand-drawn animations, they are often quite the treat to look upon, this is no different. It uses a ""watercolors"" type aesthetic although much cleaner. I wouldn't say it's the same as anime, but it share some similarities, like how the backgrounds are usually hand-drawn and the characters are drawn digitally (they still fit very well into the scene though, which I can't say for some anime's).The story takes inspiration from Irish folklore, primarily with the ""Selkie"". A creature who becomes a seal in water but human on land. One of the two main characters, an odd mute girl is one of these creatures.The folklore inspiration work quite well, however as far as the story goes - It leaves a little to be desired. It seems somewhat uninspired without anything to make it truly stand out. It'll probably make an excellent kids movie, and one that is very gender neutral. I have however seen much more sophisticated storytelling within these kinds of movies. It's not at all bad - just.. bland. The visuals though are still enough to warrant seeing this movie if find them appealing."
"Let me begin with saying: Song of the Sea is hands down the best animated film of 2014 and probably one of the best animated movies in the last... 80 years. Song of the Sea does what a lot of animators have forgotten what animation does: It does what real-life can't. It tells stories. IT HAS MAGIC IN THE DRAWINGS.Just looking at Song of the Sea is amazing in itself. While a lot of animated movies will set a nice looking atmosphere, rarely is every shot a piece in itself. Song of the Sea is beautiful in EVERY shot. There is not a single shot that hasn't been carefully constructed. And this is just one of the many great elements of this animation. Even without its good story-telling and great soundtrack, it is still one of the most beautiful animations to date. Now, the story itself can be a little bit confusing without a little prior knowledge on Irish mythology, but the movie explains most of what is needed to be known. The one advantage this movie has in story-telling is that the whole film is treated like a classic fairy-tale. Things sort of just... happen... and fall into place. This isn't done in a lazy way, but it is done in a very dream-like way so the story just naturally flows. This may sound weird, but upon viewing it it will make more sense what I'm trying to say. This effect is created mostly through minimal dialogue. There are certain spans of time in the movie where no one talks for five minutes or so. And this isn't just one scene, the movie consistently lacks dialogue and tells its story mostly through visuals. I will say this as a mild warning: THIS FILM IS NOT FOR EVERYONE.Because the film tells its story almost entirely through visuals and minimal dialogue, I could imagine it dragging for some people. This isn't the kind of animated film that uses animation to tell jokes, it is the kind of animated film that wants you to get lost in its world.On an additional note, the movie's soundtrack is very good. It is gentle, quite, and peaceful, without ever getting too big and bold. This helps keep the atmosphere consistent.Lastly, I will say what makes me even happier about this film is that it was made on a micro-budget compared to Disney, yet made an infinitely better animated film than Disney (or even Studio Ghibli) has made in some years. This movie proves that hard work, dedication, and simple beauty, can make one of the most visually impressive animated films in quite some time, and yet it still has a small budget. This proves that budget doesn't make an animated film look good.Long story short, I won't talk about the details of this masterpiece, but I will conclude that I hope to see more animated films from Tomm Moore... A LOT MORE animated films.A true inspiration for fellow animators."
"I have downloaded the movie a long time ago but i didn't have the time to see it. Two days ago i had one of my worst asthma attack ever.. it was a mess & I was completely down. I thought i should cheer up a little bit and watch a funny movie, but the truth is, if i didn't watch this beautiful, just beautiful movie i wouldn't be in this peaceful condition right now.this movie lift you up and take you to another world where everything is just beautiful, simple and astonishingly pure. It's one of the movie that can make you feel better about yourself and know that holding the sadness inside wont do any good. It provide you with a lot of positive energy to be tolerant to whatever is happening in the world.I'm really thankful to those who created such a beautiful movie."
"It's good to know that even in the new 10s, we can still get traditionally animated films of this quality, after even Disney has given up on them. Song of the Sea is of course done with a smaller budget, but you honestly couldn't tell, mostly because the animation style is so simplistically beautiful and partly because of the skill of the animators.Like their previous film, The Secret of Kells, Song of the Sea is heavily rooted in Irish folklore and mythology, which is exactly the right choice because we're once again treated to an amazingly deep, layered and emotionally mature story. This time our story follows the life of a young girl named Saoirse (Lucy O'Connell). Her mother was called away when she was born and now she's living on a small island with her dad, Conor (Brendan Gleeson), and brother Ben (David Rawle). Yet she has never uttered a single word in her life, and slowly the past of her mother and the secrets of her own origin start to unravel.Song of the Sea shines because of the complexity and personality of its characters. You're instantly pulled into the mythology of Ireland and the film is very skilled in explaining and showing the intricacies of its lore without shoving it down our throats. The various mythic characters are especially interesting, threatening, sympathetic and intriguing, all at the same time.Yet the movie's biggest problem are also some of its characters. Mainly the children. Saoirse is fine, even if a bit passive to my liking, but Ben is simply annoying. He's very much your stereotypical whiny little brat, who thinks he's entitled. And yeah, there are good reasons for it, one of them simply being that he's at that age, but it's still annoying. I wouldn't even complain all that much, but there is a way to make an annoying brat without it being annoying to the viewers.But, luckily Ben has his redeeming qualities as well, so it's nowhere near enough to ruin the film. Song of the Sea is absolutely worth a watch if you liked The Secrets of Kells or if you're still looking for new traditionally animated films."
"A boy is happy because he will gain a sister however his mother disappear after his sister was born and don't threaten her well. His grandmother takes both to her house and they begin a adventure to return home. The movie is full of magic and the plot is very enjoyable, worth to watch."
"After watching all three feature films from Cartoon Saloon (Secret of Kells, this one and Breadwinner) I have high hopes for director Tomm Moore and company, because this one takes the crown as one of the most beautiful animated feature films in recent years! The other two are as goergously animated, but Song of The Sea has this one spark which makes it a masterpiece.Even though it's a fantasy film, it really conveys a strong message of loving and letting go told through Cartoon Saloon's signature style with vibrant colours and great attention to detail and unlike The Secret of Kells it managed to go a little less in on the shapes of the characters and making them a little more realistic without sacrificing their artistic touch.As for the characters, they are well made and relatable, but I must confess that our main character, Ben, is one of those protagonists you have to warm up to, because of how he starts out as a jerk. But it's part of his character growth which makes him so much more sympathetic.I won't go into much more about the movie, but in short I'll say that Song of the Sea is a beautiful animated movie bound to capture your heart. Cartoon Saloon and its core members really deserve more attention."
Amazing animated movie. I don't know how it didn't win Oscar. I mean Big Hero 6 is also good and cool animated movie but it just isn't better than Song of the Sea. Love the soundtrack and song of the sea is amazing.
"From the opening sounds as we first hear the hypnotic ""Song of the Sea"" it is clear that this film is something special. It's a Celtic song that a pregnant mother sings to her 4 year old son to tell the tale of the Selkie, a mystical creature with the power to live as a seal at sea and human on land with the ability to carry the spirits across the oceans. Shortly after this he wakes to find his father clutching his new born sister in his arms, with his mother disappeared.6 years later, the young boy named Ben (David Rawle) has grown to be a grumpy child who has been raised by his father Conor (Brendan Gleeson), neither of whom have been able to get over the loss of a mother and a wife. He's raised along with his sister Saoirsie who has yet to speak a single word despite nearly reaching six years old. But the relationship between Ben and his sister is troubled, as he often treats her with much disdain and distance. He loves his sister as any brother would, but blames her for the loss of his mother at the same time causing him to to act out at times. This difficult situation leads to the children's grandmother (Fionnula Flanagan) to take them to the city of Dublin, away from the lighthouse and the sea in the hope of having them finally recover. But Ben misses his home, with the lighthouse being one of the few things left to connect him to his mother and sets off to journey home. On his journey he encounters the mystic creatures of Irish folk lore that he was enamoured with as a child from giants made of stone to an aged creature who contains the memories of every mystic creature in his long beard. From these creatures Ben discovers that his sister is a selkie and he must return her to the sea so she can sing the selkie's song to release the souls of the mystic creatures.Unlike the standard computer animated films that have become too commonplace, Song of the Sea is lovingly drawn with hand drawn animation. It's truly imaginative in its visuals at times creating beauty in the mundane through creating the streets of Dublin and having gorgeous bright lights engulfing the town at night. At others it creates the mystic land of the sea and the sight of the seals swimming majestically against the rough waves or giants emerging from the ocean's depths. It is constantly beautiful and carries with it stunning attention to detail bringing the world to life through incredible touches including dust particles floating in the sunlight, creating a world to behold through its more traditional take on animation. Whilst the film explores the entirety of Celtic legend, the core of the film remains its characters and how they deal with their bereavement and depression. Each character deals with their pain in a different way with some removing their emotions entirely due to not being able to handle them any longer or becoming obsessed with the past when they were happy. With this we get great emotional depth from all the characters as we can understand and even possibly relate to all the pain that they are going through. But the centre relationship is the heartwarming relationship between Ben and his sister. He is going through a difficult period of his life, at times being selfish and even cruel because of his his reeling from the loss of his mother. But as the film goes on we watch many beautiful scenes where we see he is a brother willing to go any length to save his sister.I could draw all kinds of comparisons about this films to other animated gems. I could say that it has the sense of childlike wonder that you see in a Disney film. I could say that the film delivers the same spirit of adventure of a Ghibli film. But comparisons like this do the film a disservice. This film stands in its own right delivering a unique animation style and focus on Irish culture not quite like any I've seen before. It is truly a masterpiece."
"I'am probably the most spoiled member of the public, when it comes to animated movies. Dreamworks and Pixar, well they just buy me with their style of animation, so any other is unacceptable for me, well let me just say how stupid is that. No, rely that is the most stupid thing from me for a while. And for a while I skip to watch ""Song of the sea"". This movie convinced me that magic is real. Why? Well it make me fell as a child for a hour and some, as long is the movie. It make me to remember all that stories, innocent stories which my grandfather told me before sleep. Thank you for that. I get used to all that action in animated movie, that I forgot that innocent magic piece of a story. ""Song of the sea"" brings all that to the screen. All the magic, all the story telling beauty, with appropriate animation. Why is this appropriate animation, well if you are born in late '90, you would probably not understand that, but it is time to got it, and the best way for you to got it, is to start watching this movie. It is like all those illustration in Grimm brothers books, and it is so much beautiful that is the shame for me that I didn't look this movie earlier. But I did watched now. And how Japanese say, the best time is now. Maybe this movie is special and for bringing that beautiful idea of early Disney, it is all about making some magic for the audience, it is about making audience to fell special for watching that, I think that that is the some definition of art, and pure art this movie is."
"I have seen The Secret of Kells and loved it. I had never seen such kind of animation before at that time. When I heard that the same director was going to make another animated film based on a folklore, I was eager to watch it. I can say that it was worth the wait. This film is made with a budget of $5-$10 million and still puts $150+ millions films to shame. The visuals are spectacular. I would have given it a 10 just for the visuals. However what makes it excellent is not just the visuals but everything about this film is great. Be it music, voice acting ,pace and storytelling. Moore tells the story in a beautiful way which are reminiscent of Miyazaki films. Miyazaki got the ideas from Japanese folklore and tales and put them on screen. Moore did the same thing with The Song of the Sea. It is a brilliantly made fantasy film. I will be looking forward to other films by Moore."
"People, I kid you not. An amazing, animation studio from Ireland by the name of Cartoon Saloon has arisen, and it is bound to have a legendary status. The creators behind Song of the Sea (2014) are undeniably some of the most creative and passionate people in the animation industry. You can tell it from just watching their movies!Their latest feature Song of the Sea (2014) is yet another example that shows Irish animation is world class. Like their previous works, this animated feature is beautiful and it feels so magical looking at them. What's more about this animated feature is its heartwarming theme and interesting, lovable characters, making it immensely captivating and entertaining.Honestly, most of the characters (human or not) are gorgeous and it's difficult to not love them! It has plenty of charming Irish mythological figures such as Selkie, Mac Lir the giant, Tír na nÓg, Seanachai and Macha in addition to Ben and Saoirse's cute family!The protagonists, Ben and Saoirse are also inspiring. They are just children who felt mostly lonely at home but they are very brave. These siblings learned to get along with each other and the elder brother grows up most; he has learned to be more open-minded and on how to be a responsible big brother!Ending this post, I must say that Song of the Sea (2014) is awesome! With nice music and vivid animations, their adventure in this animated feature is nothing like we've seen before! If you love mythology, I am sure you will love it! Give them a try and I am sure you will love them instantly, as much as I do!PS. This is my 92th animated movie review and it is one of the very rare that gets a rating of 10 out of 10 stars!"
"Whilst being aware of the latest CGI extravaganzas from the US,and the delicate beauty of Studio Ghibli,I started to hear about an animated title from Ireland,which appeared to have come completely from out of nowhere.Getting the very lucky opportunity to be the host of an event taking place on IMDb's Film Festivals board,I was thrilled to discover that film was one of the main festival viewings,which led to me getting ready to hear the sea sing.The plot:Living in a lighthouse,Ben,his dog Cú,his dad Conor and mum Bronagh welcome Saoirse into the family.One night, Bronagh tells the family that she loves them,and disappears into the ocean.Over the years Conor continues to mourn Bronagh's (presumed) death,as Saoirse goes mute and Ben blames her for the disappearance of their mum.On Saoirse's birthday Ben tells her a scary folk tale about an Owl Witch who take people's feelings and turns them into stone. Playing with a seashell Bronagh gave Ben, Saoirse finds a coat.Going to the ocean where her mum disappeared, Saoirse puts the coat on and transforms into a Selkie.View on the film:Proudly being a square peg that will never fit in a round hole,co- writer/(along with Will Collins) director Tomm Moore weaves a magical world with all of the characters and surroundings have pointed edges,which along with subtly expressing the rough edges of their lives,also give Ben and the family quirky designs which sharply capture the grief they have for Bronagh.Going under the sea, Moore splashes in waves of Psychedelic beauty. Produced between 4 animation studios across Europe, Moore blends the magnificent hand- drawn animation together seamlessly,with the collective approach bringing lush chalk coloured landscapes across the screen.Set on a canvas of Bruno Coulais rich score and Folk songs from Nolwenn Leroy and the band Kíla,the screenplay by Moore and Collins places the viewer in the midst of Saoirse and Ben's wonderment. Straying away from any needlessly dry exposition on the Folk legends,the writers instead present them as they are,which grip Saoirse and Ben's encounters with Færie's and Great Seanachaí's in an irresistible enchanting atmosphere. Breaking up the family in the opening scenes,the writers display extraordinary care in looking at the theme of parental loss,hitting the family hard,with Conor,Ben and Saoirse all in grief for Bronagh. Finely balancing the fantasy with the personal,the writers keep the fantastical discoveries Ben and Saoirse make be a part of their process with grief,as Conor,Ben and Saoirse hear Bronagh voice across the song of the sea."
"It's not everyday when a movie leaves you so entranced to the point your drunk on it for a few days after watching it. But somehow this movie really hit me. When I first saw The Secret of Kells some years back, I said; ""I want to see what else these people have in store"". Sure enough not to long afterward I heard that Song of the Sea was in production. At that point I was so hyped to see it. I didn't know if it was going to be better then Kells but somehow I knew that the film was going to be something special. But little did I know that Song of the Sea was going to completely blow my expectations. It's honestly hard to talk about this movie. But I guess if I had to sum it up in one word it would be; Beautiful. Everything about this movie is just beautifully handled and thought out. The characters, the story, the visuals, and it's even shot very well. You wouldn't expect that from an animation it being ""well shot"". Considering that in 2d animation the camera is just planted. But the backgrounds and the images really have crisp visual story telling.A lot of people are a little closed minded to this movie because of how unlikable Ben can be. To that I say; ""That was the point, duh""! Have any of you ever hear of a story arc? How boring and unsatisfying would the ending be if Ben was just a nice kid throughout the movie? Now for the problems with the movie. There was only one big problem with the movie. It was embarrassing to watch. Oh no, not because it was an unbearable or annoying, its because I feel embarrassed for most American animation.After watching this movie and then waking up and realizing that most American animation is mostly (not always) filled to brim with dull, sterile CG movies that are usually aimed strictly for kids. We see movies like; The Nut Job, Strange Magic, Alpha and Omega and list goes on forever. After watching Song of the Sea I just realized how ashamed I am of the animation industry in America. They need to step up their game.But enough of that. Overall just watch Song of the Sea. It's an indescribably wonder that deserves that all the attention it can get."
"""A wonderful, wonderful film. My 9 year old son was entranced watching it. The animation was pure art. My top 3 films ever. I loved the Irish mythological story.Leaves you feeling very mellow.................... Heart warming..................................................... Snuggle up with the children film .............................. Brilliant art work............................................. Love the Irish myths.......................................... Sad and happy at the same time......................................... Very different from the modern 'hectic'animations films !!. .

"Greetings again from the darkness. Fans of animation can expect to experience a bit of nostalgia as they treasure the rare hand-drawn works of animator Tomm Moore. However, Mr. Moore's artistry may even be exceeded by his extraordinary story telling ability. This gem from Ireland is an Oscar nominee for Best Animated Feature, as was Mr. Moore's The Secret of Kells (a runner-up that year to Up). It's a top notch family movie filled with adventure, fantasy, emotion and characters worth caring about.Young Ben lives an ideal life with his lighthouse caretaker father, pregnant mother, and beloved dog Cu on an isolated island. Ideal that is, until the ""Bambi's mother"" moment, which 6 years later, finds Ben's dad still in mourning, while Ben flashes animosity and blame towards his mute little sister, Saoirse (pronounced Sir-sha). What we as viewers soon learn is that cute little Saoirse is a selkie – just like her mother was. Irish and Scottish legend states that selkies can transform themselves from people to seals, and have a real connection with the sea and the fairy world.When the over-bearing, know-it-all granny decides that an island is no place to raise kids, she moves Ben and Saoirse to the big city  sans dog and dad. Of course, this is a terrible idea and the two kids are soon enough off on an adventure of self-discovery and rescue. They run into 3 of the remaining fairies who know that selkie Saoirse is their only hope with her magic sea shell (from her mom) and her as yet undiscovered singing voice. It turns out the songs Ben's mom taught him, when sung by Saoirse, can free the souls of the fairies turned to stone by the evil owl witch Macha. The real fun is in the details of their adventure.Moore's story has the feel of an ancient folk tale and legend, with a dose of mythology. Since the story coincides with Halloween, it also adds an additional element of creatures, real vs pretend. As you can see, the story is no mindless cartoon. It contains much emotion tied to the brother/sister battles, the loss of a parent, nosy relatives, and the path of discovering one's own self  even through the eyes of children. Terrific voice work comes courtesy of Brendan Gleeson, Fionnula Flanagan, David Rawle (Ben), and Lucy O'Connell (Saoirse). It's a timeless story that, amongst other things, is a legitimate Oscar contender while reminding brothers to be nice to their sister!"
"Song of the Sea has beautiful visuals throughout and is always a treat to look at. It's an intimate fantasy tale of a family living in the wake of their mother having went into the sea because she's a creature thing to become a creature thing. Now the brother and sister must get back home from their Grandmother's house and also solve the fantasy thing because the girl is a Selkie (half-seal) like her Mom was. This movie didn't really make sense to me.Watching the movie is a nice experience because the images look like well-crafted, detailed drawings like a painting from a children's book. But beneath these visuals is a story that feels like it makes enough sense to pass off, but I can't figure out why anything really happened. To put it best, this movie made up its own rules as it went along. It's like someone is telling you a bedtime story that they're just making up as they go along. It lacks proper stakes and explanations for why things in its fantasy world are the way they are. I'm not just trying to nitpick, here. Towards the beginning, I was getting a hint that this story didn't have anything at stake. They want to get home, and separately, the girl is discovering that she is a seal creature. With this discovery, which happens out of nowhere, she has a task. What is this task? She has to un-stone creatures and fairies from this fantasy world that she meets as if she is a chosen one, but she isn't. We don't know why they want her specifically or what she is getting from them by doing this. We don't know what it means for her to be a Selkie. We do know that she is going to die for some reason if she doesn't do it. So what are her tasks for accomplishing this? The one thing that makes sense is that she has to get a coat from her house, but most of the story is the two siblings wandering wherever in this fantasy world. She has to follow some little shiny things and then she'll solve the fantasy thing. I call it the ""fantasy thing"" because she's not really solving anything at all. She's just going on a thing that she needs to do because the movie said so. There's a shell that she plays that makes bad things go away when convenient, established by the movie when needed. There's a water portal in a house in the middle of nowhere that leads to a guy whose beard grows and I guess each strand tells a story. I don't know what this guy did for the story or for the characters. There are seals who help the characters ride to where they need to go in the ocean just because. The pieces in this story add up to what looks like a proper film but they don't actually make any sense, and therefore mean nothing. Unlike other fantasies, this one establishes its rules on the spot and without any grounding. By the end of the movie, I had realized that no explanation was coming for me, and that this movie simply didn't make sense. I can't say, however, that it was unpleasant to watch. The characters, while not that developed, were nice to watch and had loving relationships with one another that gives the movie some emotion. The score, I should mention, is very very good. I had a warm feeling while watching much of it, but it's hard for me not to be weighed down by its lack of making any sort of sense, and I have a hard time believing that apparently no critics see this."
"First off, I myself found this movie pretty boring. It's a story about a boy whose sister is a Selkie (a mythological seal person which I knew absolutely nothing about this myth going in and that hampered the movie immensely)Yes, I understand that this is an Irish movie, and I am sure that every kid in Ireland knows the mythology of Selkies, but as an American....I never learned about Selkies and this story does a TERRIBLE job explaining what they are. They tell you some facts, but leave a lot to 'you should have done your research before you started watching this'. This type of story is when a 'fish out of water' protagonist would have worked. But because everyone in the story knows what Selkies are, they don't feel the need to explain it. The main character finally gets the revelation and goes 'you're a selkie!' and i am there going 'that's fantastic.....what's a selkie?' The only reason I had any idea what was going on with the lore of this was because I watched this with my sister and she informed me the rules of Selkies that she learned from A different movie entirely. That is one of the places where the movie falls incredibly flat. You can't introduce such a foreign concept and just assumes everyone will know it because it is premiered in that country. If you wish to have a worldwide audience, you have to explain your lore thoroughly so no one gets left behind.Other than that, I really didn't care for any of the characters. The girl was quiet and annoying, the boy was uninteresting, and the mother was a terrible terrible person. I know everyone is heralding this movie as wonderful and beautiful, but I have to say that I didn't really enjoy it. I was too confused about the mythology and the characters weren't interesting enough to draw me in. The father was a jerk and the kids were boring. It wasn't a TERRIBLE movie I just....didn't care. And that's almost worse than being bad. I'm probably going to get a negative response as I didn't give this movie an amazing score, but, I can't help how I feel. I didn't enjoy it and a 5 is exactly what I feel it deserves."
"I was already aware of the work of the director of this film, Tomm Moore, when I saw his previous animated feature film The Secret of Kells (2009). That film like this one was very distinctive in that it was based around Irish folklore. It is highly encouraging to see a nation not really associated with much cinema output like Ireland start to release their own unique animated movies. As it turned out, both of these films got additional visibility by being nominated for Oscars at the Academy Awards, so it seems like the Irish have certainly hit on something here and I hope that more such features emerge from the Emerald Isle in the future.The Song of the Sea is another animated fantasy-adventure. It focuses on a boy and his little sister, the latter of which is a Seal child, also known as a Selkie. They live in a lighthouse on a small island with their dad, their mother having died while giving birth to the daughter. Despite being almost six years old, the little girl has never uttered a single word, alienating her from her brother. But soon the mysteries of her origins begin to emerge and strange events follow.Like Moore's last film this is another that has been made using traditional animation methods, i.e. its hand drawn. This pleases me a lot as this type of animation always seems to have more soul that CGI. The whole thing is awash with great Celtic art and it really feels like every frame is constructed with consummate care. The story tells of primal things like the call of the ocean and interweaves this with imaginative fantasy creations such as an Owl Witch. Although it has to be said that I thought some of its best and most atmospheric moments were during the domestic scenes such as the parts set in Dublin. Whatever the case, the beautiful art-work creates a feeling all of its own. I have to admit to not being entirely drawn in by the characters though, with the boy Ben being somewhat irritating to be quite honest. If I had made more of a connection with the characters then I would have rated this one higher no doubt. Nevertheless, this is a lovely piece of animation which climaxed with a sequence of extraordinary beauty when the little girl sings the 'Song to the Sea'. I have to admit it put a lump in my throat and was genuinely emotional and beautiful. This ending alone is worth watching the movie for. All-in-all, this has to go down as a creative triumph."
"In a cinematic world where originality is becoming lackluster and CGI overused, along comes a hand-drawn animated movie that delves into an ancient legend not well known to American audiences. ""Song of the Sea"" is a tale derived from Irish folklore that not only brings in stunning visuals, but an emotional depth few can match. When I first heard about this film, I thought it was one of those short animated films you would find on youtube and upon further research (and watching the Awards on TV), I was surprised to find that it won an award alongside the likes of another animated hit ""Big Hero 6"". Further research into Irish lore is what eventually won me over into seeing ""Song of the Sea"" and take in an experience I haven't felt in a long time.After the mysterious disappearance of his mother, a young boy named Ben lives with his quiet little sister Saoirse (pronounced ""seer-sha"") and depressed father in a lighthouse. Despite his responsibility as a big brother, Ben is quite bitter towards his sister, but an unexpected change is on the horizon. As it turns out, Saoirse is a selkie, human on land and a seal in water, and her voice and musical ability has the power to restore the vitality of magical creatures. However, things become grim when the girl is not only separated from her seal coat (the source of her transformation and power), but her and Ben's grandmother moves them to the city. Things become more perilous when Macha the Owl Witch sets her sights on the siblings. Ben must now journey back home with his sister and reunite Saoirse with her coat before time runs out.From beginning to end, this film had a profound effect on me. The characters have so much depth to them that they seemingly become real. Ben is initially a rather unhappy person, often taking his frustrations out on poor Saoirse, but as his journey progresses, he learns what it means to be a true brother. Saoirse herself is my favorite character. Aside from having some fascinating powers, she conveys so much emotion through her facial expressions alone despite the fact that she does not speak. There's a great sense of innocence to her as no matter what adversity she's faced with, Saoirse brings warmth to nearly every scene she's in. Some of the side characters are also good, especially this one fellow named Seanachai, a Faerie whose hair contains memories of his kind. Eccentric yet still quite fun. Macha the Owl Witch is interesting to say the least, an antagonist whose motivations are understandable, though her methods of achieving them are less than agreeable. Definitely one who defied my expectations.Other elements of the film are done in spectacular fashion. The art style is simplistic and yet so full of detail and life that it's hard not to take your eyes off it. The underwater scenes are especially fantastic to look at, perfectly capturing the beauty and tranquility the sea has to offer. The land environments, from the cities to the forests, are not too shabby either and the bright mystical elements make an ideal contrast to some of the dark gloomy atmosphere. And then we have the music. This is a soundtrack I could listen to all day. The melody and rhythm of each song makes me feel both joyful and peaceful, especially the titular song. I also like this exploration of Irish lore, so full of interesting mythological figures and stories. Finally, the climax, which I won't spoil, is one of the best I've seen in any film, with all the aforementioned elements blending together in one heck of an emotional experience.What else is there to say about ""Song of the Sea"". The story, the characters, animation, music, etc., are all wonderfully brought to life. I actually almost teared up by the time the movie was over. That alone speaks volumes of the power of this fairy tale. There seriously needs to be more films like this out there. Check out this beautiful flick and enjoy the ride!"
"Cartoon Saloon is a studio that has never ceases to amaze me. First with their film ""Secret of the Kells"" and continues to impress me with their film ""the Breadwinner"" that released after this. But to me, Song of the Sea is their biggest triumph, and can easily rival any of the animated classics out there. Firstly, the audio is beyond compare. The soundtrack is deep and moody in a fantastical sort of way. But also i'd regret not mentioning the additional sound design that helps put you directly into the film in a way I don't quite find in modern Disney films. The voice acting is also top notch. The designs and voices harmonize perfectly and not once do they sound unnatural or out of place.Speaking of the design, the look of the film is out of this world. Cartoon Saloon's unique voice as a studio is very simple, very shape based with unique textures that add that extra bit of depth and ground the characters in the world. If you're like me and fell in love with how they illustrate, i'd invest in the ""Art of"" book. It's 100% worth it. The narrative is heart-wrenching (prepare to cry) and fairly fresh. It's strength (and one of the strengths of the movie in general) is that the story is very Irish. Cartoon Saloon is a very Irish studio and I think they have a lot of pride in being able to express that through their work to the rest of the world. Hearing stories i've never seen before is something that Cartoon Saloon seems to be building a specialty for, and I hope you'll give this movie a chance for you to experience it yourself."
This is definitely one of my top 3 favorite movies! The animation style is uniquely gorgeous and the songs are hauntingly beautiful. The story arc is fantastic and you almost grow along with the characters. The emotions consumed me every minute and the ending had tears streaming down my face with my jaw open in absolute awe! AMAZING movie!
"This movie is not just good, it's amazing! Magical! The directors have done a great job, it's full of art.. did not even made me feel im watching a 2D movie even for a second. Enjoyed every second of it. Loved this :)"
"After accomplishing wonders with The Secret of Kells, Tomm Moore and the people of Cartoon Saloon came back five years later with their second animated feature, Song of the Sea. Despite going under the radar in some countries, it was lauded by critics and got another Oscar nomination for best animated feature. As for my two cents, this once again trumps through visual storytelling and Gaelic culture, but it also contains more heart than that of Kells.Unlike Kells where it took place in ancient times, this film is set in modern times. It follows a family living on the lighthouse of an island where a young boy named Ben is happy with his father Conor and mother Bronaugh. One night while Bronaugh is soon to give birth to his sister, she vanishes into the sea while the daughter Saoirse is calmly born. Although unable to speak, Saoirse soon discovers that she is the last of the selkies, which are women in Irish legends that transform from seals into people. Along with Ben, they journey off to the sea to free the ancient fairy creatures trapped in the modern world.The most genuine aspect of Song of the Sea is the relation between Ben and Saoirse, as it feels very much like a typical albeit understandable sibling relationship. Although Ben is rather snooty to Saoirse throughout much of her life, it makes sense as he deals with the passing of his own loved one, who he felt Saoirse took her from her. However, as the film goes on and Ben and Saoirse subtly bond through their journey, not only does Ben improve as a brother, but he soon discovers why his mother left Saoirse alone to him and it really elevates the heartfelt emotional side of the movie. It's fine to be moody to your siblings as children, but you mustn't be so hard on them without thinking more about them, because there's a good chance they mean more to you than you take them granted for.Some characters are more stubborn and torn like Ben's dad and their granny, but it's no more for the fact that they either want what's best for their kin or are still dealing with a loss that affected them emotionally. However, the stand out characters are the mythical creatures such as the fairies, the goddess Macha, and the great Seanchai. Alongside offering their own quirks and distinct personalities through their looks and history, they all serve the plot on trying to either raise or subdue their folklore into the heavens to be free from such struggles, like being stuck on Earth.Speaking of folklore, the tales that the movie brings up are quite extraordinary. Aside from selkies, these tales contain all sorts of spirits that definitely feel as if they emerged from a children's storybook, complete with mystic and lavish Celtic designs. The way the story crafts them as entities soon to be faded unless they are restored from a lullaby in a dramatic tale of two children helps the film create a perfect contrast between reality and fantasy, not unlike Pan's Labyrinth but certainly more family friendly.Finally, the animation and music are just sublime. Along with simple but cute character designs, the character animation is quite smooth, the backgrounds are endlessly imaginative and even symbolic at times, the effects feel like a moving painting, and the use of color blends perfectly with the environments whenever needed for the scene. While dark blue is use phenomenally for sad and emotional scenes, there is always a light to create a sense of hope and wonder in such dark times. While the score is fun and upbeat from time to time, it can also be very heartbreaking when needed, and the main song feels like a lullaby that even an adult can listen to and feel comforted just by hearing it.If Studio Ghibli is seen as the modern legend of Japanese animation, then Cartoon Saloon has officially earned the title of the modern legend of Irish animation. By boasting creative artwork, well nuanced characters and a deep source for ancient Irish folklore, Song of the Sea is a refreshingly original and breathtaking tale just waiting to be talked about. I absolutely recommend this, not just to animation buffs and those interested in Irish culture, but even to those who once had moody but real relations with their siblings. It just might remind you of a time when you ratted on your siblings before realizing how much they really do mean to both you and the rest of your family, and this film will definitely feel reminiscent to you with its timeless appeal."
"This Irish animation opens of a remote island as Bronagh tells fairy tales to her young son Ben. She is heavily pregnant and suddenly states that she must leave. Six years later there is no sign of Bronagh; Ben is living with his father and Saoirse, the young sister who was born on the night his mother was last seen. Saoirse doesn't talk and Ben appears to resent her. On the night of her birthday she finds a strange coat in a locked chest; then she goes down to the sea and swims with the seals; it is clear that she is no ordinary child. In the morning she is found on the beach. Ben and Saoirse are taken to live in the city with their grandmother while their father puts the coat in the chest and throws it into the sea. Soon Ben decides to run away because he misses his dog; Saoirse follows, playing an instrument made from a seashell. The soon meet a group of fairies and it becomes clear that the tales their mother told him were true. This includes the story of Macha the Owl-witch who takes the feelings of magical beings and turns them to stone; if they are to be freed Saoirse must be reunited with the coat so she can sing the Selkie song. It won't be easy as Macha is aware of her.I found this film to be an utter delight, like Cartoon Saloon's previous offering 'The Secret of Kells' it features Irish mythology in a beautiful manner. The story is beautifully animated with charming characters and stunning backgrounds. The settings vary from the city to the countryside to a sea with waves reminiscent of those created by Japanese artist Hokusai. There is a sense of threat but nothing that should be too scary for younger viewers. Even Mocha, the antagonist of the film isn't actually malicious. The music that accompanies the story is charming and works well. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of animation; it was something special; by the end I was both smiling and crying thanks to a bitter-sweet ending."
"What can I say, gorgeous, heart felt and magical story telling at it's best. The voice acting is brilliant, the sensitivity to character and Celtic tradition and myth are beautifully balanced. I watched it as an adult and was enchanted, but it's affect on kids is amazing. If you need a children's gift a copy of this film is perfect."
"Ben and his younger sister Saoirse live with their father Conor in an isolated lighthouse. Their mother died six years ago while giving birth to Saoirse. Unable to talk, Saoirse is starting to show special powers and sea creatures seem to respect her, indicating that she is no normal little girl.A sweet modern-day fairy tale. A linear adventure story that manages to stay reasonably focused and doesn't get too fantastical while introducing us to some intriguing characters. Mostly ideal for kids though adults won't mind it either. Quite difficult to dislike.Not very profound though - it is just a linear fantasy story, after all. So not brilliant, but still enjoyable."
"Song of the Sea is an animated fantasy drama about a brother and a sister. It is a beautiful painting of an adventure that takes two siblings on an amazing journey. In between, they will try to save lives, find a way home and most crucial, look for unanswered questions. You may not find the description as unique as the movie actually is. The reason is, this movie is not just about the adventure, it's about what they find while they are on it. It is not some treasure I speak of, it is the feeling of love towards one another, a sense of caring. Also, it is about hope, which pushes you beyond your limit to make you brave enough to face your worst fears.The animation is over the top. It feels like we are looking at mere sketches but the characters feel real as you and me. So, when they will cry, you'll get emotional too. It is the powerful scenes like these because of which this movie is amazing. The song which the movie is all about is a melody to your ears and is nicely placed in the movie.I would say that those of you who watched and liked movies like ""A Monster Calls"" and ""Kubo and the two strings"", you will like this one too. All in all, it is an interesting watch for everyone."
"This film was nominated for the Academy Award for Animated Feature, losing to Big Hero Six. There will be spoilers ahead:This film was done by Cartoon Saloon, which also released The Secret of Kells. I personally think this film is even better than Kells, which was excellent. The animation in both is beautiful, the story in this one is just a touch more intriguing and the soundtrack is wonderful here.The story revolves around Ben and Saoirse, a brother and sister. They lost their mother around the time of Saoirse's birth. Ben is somewhat resentful of his sister for various reasons, one of which is the fact that, at six, she still doesn't speak.Early on, it becomes obvious that Saoirse is different. It turns out that she's a selkie-a human who is also a seal when she wears her ""skin"", a white fur coat. The children's grandmother finds Saoirse on the shore and decides that the children should live in the city with her rather than at the lighthouse with their father.Saoirse has a musical talent connected to s shell their mother gave to Ben and draws faeries to her when she plays. Other fantastic folk find her and take her to their hiding place to try to convince her to save the faerie folk from the Owl Witch, who is stealing their emotions and turning them into stone. An attempt by owls to grab Saoirse is foiled when Ben jumps in to try to save his sister and their relationship changes for the better.They must return home for Saoirse's coat and have some adventures singly and together before they come home to find that their father has thrown the coat in its chest into the sea. Ben takes it on himself to try to get the coat to save his sister, who will die if she doesn't have the coat Ben gets the coat back with help from an unlikely source, Saoirse sings in order to save the faeries and other mystical folk from disappearing and also save herself. The ending is wonderful and I won't spoil it here.Virtually everything about this film is marvelous and I personally think this was the second best nominee for Animated Feature, behind The Tale of Princess Kaguya. I liked this more than I did Big Hero Six, which I considered very good as well. The music in Song of the Sea is particularly fine. It's just an excellent production.This film is available on Blu Ray and DVD. If you have the capability, go for the Blu Ray, which looks gorgeous. Most highly recommended."
"Wow, where to start? This film was beautiful to look at and on so many other levels. It penetrates the viewer emotionally and mythically hitting right in the heart. I've never seen a film that manages to capture feeling so much. I think it's the beautiful color and music. About half way through this turned in to my favorite movie in a long while. I love that elements of Irish folklore are being brought to the screen considering the mythology and folklore of their civilization, despite being so powerful, is disregarded theatrically. I hope the films Tomm Moore is doing will inspire others to get involved in bringing this lost seed back to our lives. I tried to go deeper into this review but suffice to say I was just left in awe and don't really know what else to say but if you wonder if you should view it as I said the art is amazing and so is the story so all the elements for a joyful experience are there. I cried more than I've cried in years and I don't even really ever cry but it was tears of the sheer beauty I felt. This was a story that really captivated me and I was captured and my mind put in the rear view for the last hour."
"I watched this film with my grandparents, not knowing what to expect. I'm a huge fan of Celtic and Gaelic culture, and this movie appealed to me. I didn't know what to make of it until I watched it, so I kept my mind open. The next day after watching it I went to the store and bought it.First off, it's one of the few hand-drawn groundbreaking animated films since ""Princess and the Frog"" back in 2009. Being recognized by the Academy with 7 Annie Award nominations and a nomination for Best Animated Feature by the Oscars, beating out 'The LEGO Movie' and 'The Book of Life' for the last spot in a thin five-nominee category.The story is amazing, the colors are beautiful, and the original spiritual feel of true, ancient lore and legend give this movie the tangibility of a 3D high-tech animated feature. Saiorse, the last member of her kind known as a Selkie, a mythical creature of Irish lore that is said to be able to transform into a seal and back to human and vice versa, attempts to try and save the rest of her kind, without saying so much as a word until the final 15 minutes! The contrasting attitude of big brother Ben, who blames Saiorse for everything, including the death of their mother, and now emotionless Dad, who is still tormented from his wife's death all complement and contrast each other perfectly. Put them together with the playful sheep dog Cù and a wide variety of fairy creatures of many shapes, sizes and attitudes, and you get a unique film pulled straight out of the Irish sea.A film that broke ground, developing an absolute perfect blend between ancient lore, modern day, classic animation, friendship, sibling rivalry, fairies, and the true power of family and magic. In my opinion, it could possibly be the highest rated animated film since 'The Lion King.'I definitely give this film a 10/10. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this film. One of the greatest representations of Irish folklore I have ever seen."
"I apologize for my lack of grammar but I just finished experiencing this movie and have to spill out my thoughts before they evaporate into the large sea of my vast movie ""knowledge"". Being a movie critique for a job is tough having to watch movies and give them a accurate analysis is really dragging, and you can't be kind to movies, because of the impact they have on those can be ecstatic. So when I do a analysis of movies I start with what I understand and work into what I don't. First starting the movie at a rating of 5 and move it up and down on that scale until the movie is over. After I use a tape recorded to ""rant"" essentially what was good and bad about the film or movie and then I write a long detailed analysis on what I experienced when enveloped into the movie or film. Doing this again and again eventually makes all movies seem different but receive the around same overall rating (using a scale of 1-9) and most movies fall under the 1-6 category. I am the ""Anton Ego"" of movies I do enjoy to picking things apart to find the flaws, and from what my boss tells me I do it well. I rate most movies around the poor/average zone, especially newer movies that all use the same system when being produced.Now anime movies fall under a much different category when I review them. Especially movies from the Ghibli realm. Anime movies seem to fall on the higher side of my scale (around 7-8). Now on my scale a ""10"" essentially can't exist the movie would have to provide a perfect grade in all category's which is essentially impossible. I actually never gave a movie a full 9, until I saw Song of the Sea. This movie encapsulates pure beauty on a level that I have not seen before, and I have seen many levels. I rate this movie so highly because the movie quality is of the highest I have ever seen. The animation is like a ivory white canvas waiting to be painted on by god. The music is absolutely beautiful on a level that I have not yet heard, you can see every slow little detail took time, the story, animation and theme blends together in a smoothly colorful pallet that is used to completely influence your soul to enjoy the crazy story and characters. This movie redefines animation. This movie is an adventure, but it's more then that, this movie it's own genera, but it's more than that this movie is a opera of colors and sounds all blended together to create it's story and characters with utmost creativity and imagination. This movie is infinity in animation. I have trouble picking my ""favorite"" movie of all time, and this question comes up to often. Now I have a definite answer. Song of the Sea is perfection, as far as the stars can go this movie ""for me"" will always be beyond them."
"Upon winning an Oscar nomination for his exquisitely animated film The Secret of Kells in 2009, for his follow-up, Song of the Sea, director Tomm Moore accomplished the same again. He lost the Oscar to Disney's Up in the first case and again won in Big Hero 6 for the second time by Disney. Nonetheless, watching Moore's films tackle these big hitters is still great. Ben and his little sister Saoirse are sent to stay with their aunt following their mother's death while their father is still in mourning. They take it upon themselves to find their own way back home by embarking on a fantastic journey across the ocean where they are tasked with liberating faeries and protecting the spirit world while exploring the mystery and ancient mythology of the Selkies-mythical seals that can transform into human form when on shore. Like in The Secret of Kells, Moore is again concentrating on Irish mythology and imbuing the whole story with the same ethereal beauty that he used in his debut so brilliantly. His traditional, hand-drawn animation in an age of over-produced computer-generated content is a joy to behold and so refreshing. With only two movies (and an upcoming addition to a chapter of The Prophet by Khalil Gibran), Moore was listed in a similar light to the great Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki for his ability to create his own magical and enchanting tales. Personally speaking, I believe the Miyazaki analogy is far too late, but Moore is undeniably a star, irrespective of that. His universes and creativity can be fantastic at times, and Sea Song is a beautiful piece of storytelling. He has minor pacing problems, but, like The Secret of Kells, and younger viewers can find their attention challenged. That being said, the flaws this happened to that film have been modified a bit. His narrative is deeper and more interesting and his decision to stick with the musician Bruno Coulais and the Irish folk group Kila leads to a perfectly fitting score reflecting and complimenting the spirit of Celtic mythology. A fascinating and beautifully crafted fable of rights-of-passage where the narrative and symbolism interweave almost perfectly. Last year's Oscar nomination was absolutely deserved and very disappointed to bow out to Big Hero 6. The Academy is well known for making wrong choices, but it is incredibly disappointing that they would ignore this in favor of something that just happened to make more money. This is a genuine animation gem."
"I loved it! Even though I watched it alone and I am 28 years old :)This movie is an very special animation: designed for children, but with a lot of deep truths about the burdens of our life as humans.Fear is designed to keep us from danger, but accepting the truths of life is our greates quest as human beings. The animation techniques are more simple than the ones used by the block busters, but still they are so beautiful and harmonious.Really, watch it with your children (or alone :)) and enjoy the ride."
"If this movie is in your watchlist WATCH IT. If it's not, still watch it. If you like animated films WATCH IT! If you're wanting an emotional movie with heart to it, WATCH IT!This movie was nominated for Best Animated Picture for the year 2014, and it lost to Big Hero 6, which is hard for me to comprehend. This movie is so powerful, original, beautiful, and touching. The characters cry... A LOT! You feel it. And it makes you want to cry.This movie has been on my watchlist since 2014 but I've neglected it until now for my Decade in Review series on YouTube. I'm so glad I finally watched it. Please do yourself a favor and watch this film. I loved it... way more than I thought I would."
"Greetings from Lithuania.""Song of the Sea"" (2014) is not your typical straightforward animation for kids. This is a beautifully done animated movie based heavily on a Irish mythology, but that is all i can say about the story - i do not know it. But the movie was beautiful and while it dragged a bit that was mostly because i wasn't prepared for a story, heavily based on traditional story. The ending was emotional, and done in a beautiful way."
A beautiful and masterfully made film. It gets my seal of approval.
"As to be expected from Tomm Moore and team, this is another amazing film.
The art style is sweet and expressive, the soundtrack is a delight. The plot was great but felt strangely paced sometimes. The characters were nicely donce, even though it took me a bit to fully warm up to them.
Not that there was any more need to warm my heart after getting to glimpse those seals...Spawn ratings: 10/10. (""I wanna be a selkie!"")"
Tomm Moore is an animation genius. This movie isn't just beautifully done. It's a wonderful backbone of a story that shows innocence and grief. It sheds light on taking in your emotions instead of heading them away. The story has a plot but with no true villains only people with misunderstood intentions.Song of the Sea is a masterpiece. I only wish more people knew of it.
The art is so stylish and detailed that makes it delightful to watch. The folklore in the story adds a magic touch to it ;). Songs like a lullaby and nice characters makes it a captivating film. As a fan of 2D animation this is a must watch.
"This movie is beautiful with a moving storyline, character relationships, and a hauntingly beautiful score. It is a touching story of loss and how the love found between family helps to heal if you open yourself to it.
The Irish mythology is wonderfully wound throughout with selkies, the owl witch Macha, and the giant who cried an ocean.
I use this movie as part of our St. Patrick's Day celebrations, and it's the perfect addition to the other activities I was doing."
"17 August 2016. What makes this animated feature children's movie stand out is its simplicity. The fresh, but simple flowing animated scenes, without the details of 3-D like Caroline (2009) or Paddington (2015), allows for the story to be the headliner and focus on a story legend capture the audience under its spell. Song of the Sea is even more softly tinged with flourishing beauty than the more solid tones of animated dog of Bolt (2008). This product of Ireland echoes the Japanese focus on story over technical finesse of animated technology as From Up on Poppy Hill (2013) and Spirited Away (2001). This film is fresh and more lyrical mythic visually dream-like approach to animation of a very appealing legend."
"Song of the Sea (Irish: Amhrán na Mara) (2014) 
Director: Tomm Moore 
Watched: 8/8/18 
Rating: 8/10 {Clue: Sophomore effort from Moore's Cartoon ____ } Selkie folklore gorgeously portrayed- making therianthropy and shapeshifting appear magical rather than scary. Adorable side characters that are easy to fall in love with- from Cú the oversized shaggy dog to the scatterbrained Great Seanachaí whose memory is ingrained in his many overlong strands of hair to the singing trio of Faeries to Macha the outwardly mean witch that is afraid of emotions. Looks like a children's storybook with its watercolor pastel palette and simple hand-drawn animation. Outstanding soundtrack with playful melodies, enchanting Irish folk artists, and traditional Gaelic songs. Ostensibly for young viewers, but older ones will benefit from heartfelt themes of loss, forgiveness, love, loyalty, family. Not your typical animated film- meandering in pace and content a little heavy-handed for children, but a mesmerizing adventure impossible not to be enchanted by. #Acrostic #PoemReview #AnimalLove #Animated #Irish #MagicalRealism #Shapeshifting"
"This type of movies are very difficult to find.It feels like this magic.When I run from the blame, Hide from the pain, I feel it in my body. When I just can't let go, Fear starts to show, I feel it in my body. Oh I feel this Magic, And it's deep inside. Cause I believe in Magic, When I see your eyes. You know that it's Magic. Cause I believe in Magic. When I'm numb from the game, Tired of the blame, I feel it in my body. When I just can't say no, Fear starts to show, I feel it in my body. Oh I feel this Magic, And it's deep inside. Cause I believe in Magic, When I see your eyes. You know that it's Magic. Cause I believe in Magic."
"Everything about this movie is extremely well done. There isn't even anything to say because I would just be redundantly praying every aspect (animation, story, characters, music, etc). There are some dumb moments but that's not important."
"'Song Of The Sea (2014)' is a straightforwardly beautiful folk-tale with a wonderfully kind and magically uplifting spirit. Its profound emotional payoff will surely bring a tear to the eye of even the most stone-hearted of giants. The animation itself is gorgeous, echoing the simple pure-soul of the piece, and the film's overall effect is one which makes you want to smile for quite a while, impressed that what you've just witnessed was aimed at children and yet touched you so deeply and effectively on an emotional and intelligent level. Profound, sometimes saddening yet pleasantly stirring. 8/10"
"(Flash Review)This is a touching little story mixed in among some vaguely explained Celtic mythology. While the mythology and symbolism is vague, it did let me ponder the visuals and try to figure out some things. Helped to read IMDb reviews after watching. Aside from that, the tale kicks off with a pregnant mother who suspiciously leaves her husband and child. Later, the grandmother gets involved with the family. The meat of the story is hard to explain but the child goes on an adventure trying find the whereabouts of his mother and comes across other mythical experiences along the way, one being some special sweater, shawl, coat or something. The viewer is awash in beautiful and dreamy scenery with a pleasant film score accompaniment. Some of the vagueness is tied up in the end but the vagueness weakened my emotional connection a notch. Overall, it was a fun and unique film for those looking something that won't end up on kids backpacks, pajamas and stickers."
"This is a wonderful movie with wonderful artwork that really brought back my childhood. You know those vibrant and colorful story books with pictures that your elementary school teachers use to read to the students. Well it's kind of like that except it's like watching a moving children's story book that even adults can enjoy and be mesmerized with. It's rare to see amazing 2D animation movies that isn't from japan, so this movie was a treat to sit through. This is a stunning and hand-drawn animated folk-lore journey. That encompasses the importance of understanding, bonding and how good intentions might not always be the right choice. This is a wonderful 2D animated movie I would recommend to kids and adults.9/10"
"A young Irish lad finds out that his younger sister is a mythical half-human creature called a 'selkie' - a discovery that eventuates in adventures for them both in this pleasant animated feature film. The mythologies surrounding selkies are a little on the complex side, however, the film stands up well as a tale of a boy coming to understand and truly appreciate his sister for all her special and unique qualities, even if some of the finer points of the narrative are hard to nut out. His sister is simply adorable and as she hardly utters a word throughout, this is something that is best attributed to the animation itself and the way the character is written: how much she dotes on her brother despite her affections not being returned, etc. Though a drama first and foremost, the film has several effective comical moments. Not all of the humour works, but there is a lot of amusement to be had in the seal-like creatures trying to track the sister down while donning random disguises and hiding in garbage bins. The music is also as good as one would expect for a film with 'Song' in its title."
"Animation is a tricky thing (no pun intended). On the one hand it's considered a kids domain, though recently many films have proved that their storytelling is at least as good as any ""real"" feature film out there. Then there is a the issue with the animation style in general. This right here, will not please everyone's eye or style/liking they may have. But it's substance rather than anything else that matters here. And it's how you should look at it.Having that out of the way, the movie tells a story that I reckon almost everybody can get behind with. While it should therefor appeal to parents or adults in general too, it's the kid in this that takes the journey, discovering and growing (up) along the ride. There was a reason this was nominated for an Oscar ... Sometimes the Oscars do get it right"
"The story is about a little girl who is related to fairy-tale creatures thru her mother and able to become a seal. She also has the ability to rejuvenate many creatures in nature thru the power of her song and so is viewed by them as their salvation. She needs to wear her special coat to work her magic, though, and as the movie progresses this becomes central to it's suspense and drama.After 30 mins or so of this my interest began to ebb. Notwithstanding, there was enough there to make me see it thru to the end. Personally I felt there wasn't enough here for an adult mind. Most, anyway. Unless this animation was strictly designed for kids 8 and under, I would say both story and artwork was, I think, too ""elementary"" in their construction. However, I wouldn't have minded the simple, flat, brittle, and abstract artwork (unlife-like in movement and appearance) if there was more creativity, cleverness, and complexity to the story-telling.That said, Reader, the irony is I wouldn't have minded the elementary story-telling so much if the artwork had given me something to gawk at. Hence, had been richer, more detailed and life-like as, for example, ""Ponyo"" which was for me pure eye-candy. It also dealt with magic and the sea. If you've seen Ponyo, you know what I mean. If you haven't, and you love animation, then you're wasting time with my review. You need to make tracks and get yourself a copy posthaste for your video library!!! I guarantee you pure pleasure. If you're able, may I suggest you lock yourself away with a large viewing screen with stereo headphones and have your favorite snack handy to take the experience to the next level. And if family and friends wonder what you're doing, let them speculate. ""Cadbury"", anyone? Love, Boloxxxi."
"Tomm Moore's second feature has a lot in common with his 2009 debut ""The Secret of Kells"": both are hand-drawn, both are rooted in Celtic mythologies and Irish folklore tradition, both are (at least) nominated for an Oscar.The animation is unbelievably beautiful. The rediscovery of Celtic mythologies is certainly a smart gesture of identity. But the way in which these indigenous stories are woven into a modern story of family value is purely boring and the image of women is absolutely appalling. The moral of the story is mediocre at the best, but for a good reason: to write a subversive version, the original story has to be very well known among the public. So I guess the great innovation of this movie (and of ""The Secret of Kells"") lies in its unapologetic embrace of the local cultural heritage and the audacious move to bring it on the world stage via cinema, arguably the most international and most accessible art.The adult-child dichotomy is utilized to sew together the universes of artistic creation and storytelling. It serves as the metaphor for a few other dualities such as reason-emotion, reality-imagination, and most importantly the modern industrial and colonial world versus the indigenous Irish/Scottish culture marked by lovely folklores yet unknown to the world. The characters' refusal of urban life and attachment to the sea and the family forms a certain type of postcolonial nostalgia that permeates the movie."
"It's my first review on IMDb. I just can't not to share me impressions about this beautiful, extremely emotional animated movie. It's another masterpiece by Tomm Moore, whose ""The Secret Of Kells"" also is one of my favorite movie. Well, ""Song of Sea"" has everything to be a great masterpiece of art - incredible design and animations, beautiful soundtracks, interesting storyline. From even first scenes of the film I knew, that it would be something different between contemporary empty and aggressive animated movies. This movie has a great power to drag you in the world of magic and beauty. That's all. Sorry for my English, I'm not native English speaker, Just enjoy the film!"
"I had the pleasure of seeing Song of the Sea at a film festival the other day, and was thoroughly mystified. It had this absolutely gorgeous, idiosyncratic animation style that was like a breath of fresh air from a world awash in either American 3D animation or traditional Japanese anime. In fact, personally, I'm reminded of Wes Anderson: the stylized visuals, quirky characters, and a lot of symmetry. This ultimately helps immerse one into this contemporary, yet out-of-this-world universe that's created here. However, the movie also succeeds on its story and atmosphere.In this movie, Ben lives with his parents happily in a lighthouse on an island. When his mother (a selkie - she can turn into a seal) disappears giving birth to his little sister (also a selkie), the family falls apart: Ben becomes a lousy brother, their father gets lost and consumed with grief, and the fussy grandmother keeps trying to move the kids to the city. After she succeeds, Ben and Saoirse run away and are quickly pulled into a Spirited Away-esque fantasy world wrought with conflict, where its up to them to save the spirit world.While Spirited Away was influenced by traditional Japanese folklore, Song of the Sea does the same with Irish and Celtic folklore instead. Like Hayao Miyazaki's animated masterpiece, this is a breathtaking, yet evenly paced and mesmerizing journey of pure fantasy. While not as bombastic, Song of the Sea delivers in its own way: it slowly weans us into the mystical world, as if in a wild dream, and delivers a sublime, more structured story. Personally, I think the story is a work of art, despite what others have said, especially in the way it parallelizes a contemporary family drama with the Irish folklore- inspired fantasy adventure.In fact, it is merely influenced by the works of Miyazaki; Song of the Sea as a movie is strong enough to stand on its own merits. The influences from Miyazaki and Anderson may be noticeable, but Song of the Sea is still unlike anything I've seen from either of those two, or from cinema in general. After seeing it, I was left truly impressed, having just witnessed such a quiet, yet profound, beauty. Song of the Sea is simply wonderful, and an animated work of art. 10/10."
"The story, based on a local legend is not really a true to the original tale. Instead the movie adapts the legend into a more contemporary time frame and adds it. But still the movie retains the legend's aspect of being magical and mysterious by animating the whole movie in a a somewhat peculiar way. Most of the time the animation presents a pretty landscape background only to stand before more simply drawn character foregrounds. It looks like the reverse of what the classic Disney cartoon movies did with the more detail foreground characters amid the not so concerned background. This movie also presents a peculiar way of perspective drawing, using the style of what most people see on kindergarten children drawings. This adds the flavor that to the movie and appeal to that kind of target audience. For me it's really quite a bum since the movie doesn't really have a wider distribution"
"If you're a fan of Japanese animated films, and in particular the work of Hayao Miyazaki (a fair share of which feature in the IMDb top 250), then you might wonder why nothing similar has come out of the US and Europe for such a long time, and you may have come to the same one-letter-response that I did: Disney. That company may not have complete control over every animation company in the Western world or every technology, but they certainly exert control over animated content. Which means that not only Disney features tend to move along certain gender stereotypes. And that may have made you feel just as queasy over the years as it did me, for there's a weirdly adult dynamic in most Disney films.Maybe this is the secret of 'Song of the Sea' and the enthusiastic response it's been receiving. For this is truly a film for children, a fairytale, a story about family bonds, a story based on the degrading, yet all-important link between man and nature. Like Miyazaki's films, it touches upon something in children and adults alike, a yearning to belong, to dream, and to wonder. Most importantly, it doesn't try to sell you something. It doesn't want to make you look or dress or sing in a certain way. It doesn't place any sexual divide between girls and boys, its characters are who they are. And it respects its viewers as people, not as marketing targets.Perhaps the critical success of this piece will inspire some sort of a renaissance of the almost lost art of animated film in the West. Perhaps younger viewers will take a look at similar classics of the past, like 'The King and the Mockingbird' (1980) or the Soviet 'Snow Queen' (1957) or the far better early Disney films themselves, first and foremost 'Alice in Wonderland' (1951). Or perhaps this will remain a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and the Disney machine will continue to suffocate our dreams. In any case, don't miss this."
"I have been after this movie ever since I saw its trailer and when I finally found it, I was super-duper excited to see it. From the trailer, you can see that the illustrators use an imaginative (for this age) drawing style that leaves an impression. Personally, I do tend to prefer 2D animation to 3D, simply because I grew up with it, but in this movie, the 2D animation is part of what makes it so unique.I saw this on a late Friday night (at around 1AM) and watched it in my bed – I did the whole silent chocking/crying, trying to not wake up my roommate and make a fool out of myself. But it was just so beautiful that I couldn't contain myself. If you asked me to describe this movie, I would use the words cute, adorable, sweet, beautiful and stunning. And when I say sweet, I really do mean it – I thought the story was utterly touching and made me smile all throughout. In a bundle, it's the adventures of a brother and a sister but it is also so much more.I have never really explored Irish folklore before but this movie left a great impression on me – it was delicately told and not forced upon me, with little chunks being revealed over the course of the film. And the music! It fit perfectly.I just think this was one of the most wonderful and relaxing movies I have seen in a while. I've already recommended it to a lot of friends and family and I urge you to see it. I certainly can't wait to watch it again!Final word: Stunning. Date watched: 2015.03.20 Rating: 9 | 10"
"4.9 of 10. Whether this is intended as a pat on the head for, like Secret of Kells, a good try from Ireland or if the people in charge of nominating animated films for the Oscars simply have horrible taste and a narrow-minded focus on the technical aspects of animation, they need to be replaced.I found 1 thing technically impressive about this film: the realism of weight/force and motion. Beyond that, it has style, but hardly unique or so above and beyond everything else that it deserves an award for that alone.The story is interesting insofar as its from Ireland and not a conventional, well-known fairytale. Unfortunately, it's also not much of a story or fairy tale. Very straight forward, unoriginal family issues surrounded by more interesting creatures of magic, but again not compelling or extraordinary.As a whole, the typical TV cartoon I'd expect to see during holiday season, in this case St. Patrick's Day.Looking for unnominated Oscar-quality cartoons from last year? Try Mr. Peabody & Sherman, Nut Job, or Penguins of Madagascar. It wasn't a huge year for cartoons outside of the top few films, which at least the Academy picked as if they had a clue at the very top."
"""Song of the Sea"" is a film that might not have gotten much notice had it not been nominated for the Oscar for Best Animated Feature. While I liked the unusual graphics quite a bit, the Celtic-inspired plot left me a bit cold.The story is about two kids, Ben and his little sister Saoirse (pronounced 'Seer-See'). Their mother is a selky (also spelled selkie) and that is a person who is part magical seal (sort of like a furry but not so icky). It seems that their father boinked a selky (ewwwwww!!!) and now Saoirse is starting to exhibit selky-like behaviors. But Dad isn't thrilled about this and sends the kids to live with their boring grandmother in the city. Sounds confusing and weird? Well, there is MUCH more about this that gets weirder--making the film a bit like ""Spirited Away"" but with very different graphics. An interesting looking film but one that probably will leave many viewers (especially kids) a bit confused and bored."
"Ben picks on his sister Saoirse all the time. She's 6 and still hasn't spoken a word. Their father Conor continues to mourn their lost mother. They live in a lighthouse. Using her mother's conch shell, Saoirse discovers another world of magic. She's a selkie who can transform into a seal. Conor discards the mother's trunk and sends the kids away to the city at their grandmother's without him or their dog Cu. Ben runs away to get back his dog. Saoirse joins him on their trek back to the lighthouse as they encounter faeries and discover that their mother's bedtime stories are actually true. However without her coat, Saoirse has no voice as she fades away.It's a magical Celtic tale filled with heart-warming charm. The animation is in the style of a hand drawn children's book. That just adds to the charm. The story is more than a fantasy. It's the sibling family love. There are elements that are new and feel fresh. It has a light loving touch."
"The animation does not have the ""benefit"" of the Hollywood rendering processes and therefore appears a little less sophisticated than the Hollywood blockbusters at first glance. However, the visual impact of the images would be lost if this was done. The real impact of this story is towards the end when the little girl finds her song and the world changes in images that are almost impossible to describe. In many ways this film defies any attempt to categorize it. Both children and seniors and all ages in between can find something to enjoy. I saw it twice a few weeks apart and it was better the second time as I saw new images and events I missed the first time. Highly recommended - a tale to cherish. The ancient myths about the selkie are not generally known worldwide, so it would help if a viewer googled ""selkie"" before watching the film. I did that after watching the movie the first time, and it changed my understanding the second time."
"It's kind of basic story about overcoming sorrow, but that's not necessarily a minus for an animation movie. It gives a fresh approach to the Celtic folklore, or at least it's not something I've seen before.I think it's just a good metaphor and the movie doesn't directly lead you this way, but it can also work on another level, if you imagine that everything happens only in the mind of the main character.What makes the movie outstanding, however, is the artistic quality of the animation and music. It's very beautifully and uniquely drawn and the music fits the picture perfectly. The pace is kind of slow at places, but it still works very well, as you have more time to enjoy the animation.I would have probably given it 8/10, but at the end I found myself quite emotionally attached to the main characters, so here comes the extra point!- 9/10"
