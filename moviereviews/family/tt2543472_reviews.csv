Reviews
"Geez, reading some of these reviews makes me feel sad for some people that they couldn't enjoy this movie.First, I should state that I read the book. The movie adaptation stays pretty close to the book, and definite captures the tone and structure.Second, what the heck is wrong with this being lighthearted? No, it was not meant to be a poster of what bullying is always like. I saw comments along the lines of, ""I was bullied and this is crap bc it's so much worse."" Please don't compare your experience to this fictional movie/book. It is not meant to be a representation of bullies and the bullying experience everywhere.Third, if you found this shallow or thought it was just meant to talk about bullying you're just plain wrong. Several characters were deeply developed and multi-dimensional. Not one character is perfect (although Summer comes pretty close).Fourth, the point you missed. This story is about a family that struggles with their own personal things as well as an issue with one family member that affects them all in different ways. The friendship storylines are similar. The point of this book (and it was definitely written for younger audiences, that should be noted), is to give kids a broad overview of how bullying affects others and ways they can combat it. I love that the ending raises Auggie up: the point is how a family can support one another and how that can create resilience in a child and then how the larger community can work together (and in some instances, confront and change) to cheer one another on. Is this idealistic? YES. Is it meant to be, to teach and illustrate a lesson on how things can be if we work together, first in our own homes and then in our communities? YES.One final note, because I see people do this over and over again now with movies and literature. To the person who said something along the lines of, ""it's so hypocritical that we're supposed to be rooting for people to not judge Auggie and then he judges people by their shoes."" Did you just need to feel offended and self-righteous? My gosh. This is real. awe all judge people, if Auggie didn't, who himself is constantly judged, then how would he be relatable at all? The author (and the movie) go on to challenge these assumptions. The ""hand-me-down"" kid is a friend, then messes up, then tries to make it right. The ""crazy"" girl consistently pushes back against the bullying in a way that many kids do (it's less confrontational and more socially acceptable); that's real. And the ""trust fund"" kid continuously pushes his privilege around in often mean ways, that we all sometimes do without thinking. There had to be a bully somewhere for the story to even unfold, right? And turns out his mom does the same: back to the point of it starting at home.Okay, I'm done being annoyed with humanity now. <3Just enjoy the movie and use it to teach your kids to support one another in the home and stand up for what's right when they're not home."
"We Need this type of movies nowadays!It is an emotional, funny & uplifting story. I was fully sympathized with August Pullman. It was so wonderful to see and feel everything through him. The way he describes everything is so beautiful. Also, knowing the story from the perspective of certain characters made a strong connection between me and them.I read the book. It was awesome too. Some details were changed in the movie but were good changes and there are some details from the book I hoped the movie to show it and it didn't but that didn't affect the movie in a negative way. Everything was simple, clear and on point. The movie has strong messages about kindness, love, appreciating everyone for who they are and true friendship.Jacob Tremblay proves again his talent as an actor. You won't recognize him because of the makeup but his expressions, voice and eyes were really persuasive. All the kids are amazing. Izabela Vidovic surprised me a lot. Julia Roberts is excellent and Owen Wilson was great. He was exactly as I imagined him while reading the Book.Finally, Stephen Chbosky. Great job man! Once again he made me care about the characters and he portrayed them beautifully specially the kids. He let them shine in every scene.I loved this movie so much. I had a great and enjoyable time with it. I laughed and cried. It is pure and heartwarming. This is a perfect family movie."
"First of all, I gotta say that I read the book. I absolutely loved the book. Now, I wasn't going to raise my expectations for the movie adaptation because we all know how movies disappoint in comparison to the book. Wonder however, stays true to the book, which is its major redeeming point. I thought it would be some modified, really boring movie that would make me sigh throughout the whole 2 hours as I pointed out key flaws and differences between the movie and book (because I'm one of those people), but I loved it. The acting was INCREDIBLE, the story stayed true to the book (they only left out a flew plot points rather than invent their own) and it was overall a great experience. When I got out of the cinema, so many people were crying or said they had cried and I was overjoyed to find out that I wasn't the only person who felt touched. The child actors are fantastic, but overall there wasn't one bad actor. IF you were considering seeing this movie but weren't sure because you thought it might be boring, trust me, it's really worth the watch!!"
"I loved this movie! I was expecting this movie to be a child's version of the classic ""Elephant Man"" but it was so much more. Delving into different aspects of Auggie's life and developing the characters around him.This was brilliantly done and has a positive message for all ages and all walks of life. I highly recommend it for anyone!"
"Here's the thing - the film is asking you to see the real person inside, to offer kindness because 'everyone's fighting a battle'.Yet, as soon as Auggie is introduced to fellow classmates, his overly-cutesy narration goes ""you can tell a lot about people by their shoes"". Camera pans down. ""The trust fund kid. The hand-me- down kid. The crazy one"" (cut to clip of the girl being attention seeking, as if to reinforce Auggie's assumptions). The audience is supposed to lol along. How is this fair? Immediately Auggie is stereotyping kids before they've even spoken, something he himself is plagued by. Similarly, it then introduces one bully after another, always 'curing' the first bully (with a message of ""hey - with a bit of kindness, even bullies turn happy and become your best friend!"") before moving onto the next. Of course, despite all this ""see the real person inside"" malarky, the film can't help but introduce some 'super-bullies' (older 7th graders!) who the kids delight in beating up as they 'bond' as new found friends. Then, Auggie receives a recognition prize despite all the other kids being the ones who help him - often having to fight against his negative expectations and assumptions of their agenda. Its very confused and jarring in its messages. Wonder is absolutely your 'safe' family film where everyone bumbles along to happy- plinky-plonky piano music, and any problems are soon solved with a hug. It takes place in an ideal world where anxieties, insecurities, bullies, and all complex human issues are solved via simplistic and contrived 'fixes' (normally involving hugs). I would like to say this doesn't matter because kids and families just want light entertainment - but I think it really does matter. Films have so much more power to inspire and share human truths and complexities, there's no real point in just passing the time with something so shallow."
"Have you ever felt like you were the same as everybody else, but you were also different from the world? 10-year-old Auggie Pullman will tell you that while he feels extraordinary on the inside, outside, he doesn't feel like that. He feels lonely, invisible to everyone around him. I guess, maybe we all feel like that sometimes. Maybe we're outsiders trying to leave a mark on the world, just like Auggie. Which is why ""Wonder"" appeals to the underdogs in all of us. This beautiful book, which came from the riveting and honest imagination of author R.J. Palacio, has touched the lives of millions of readers of all ages (I'm one of those readers). Now, with the help of co-writer/director Stephen Chbosky (Author/screenwriter/director of one of my favorite tales, ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"", Co-writer of Disney's astonishing live-action remake of ""Beauty and the Beast""), I can't imagine anyone, kid or adult, ever being disappointed with this endearing adaptation of a beloved book that has great messages of never judging a person by their looks and to always choose kind, which is something that we all need to learn from in this day and age. With convincing prosthetics and makeup that makes look nearly unrecognizable, the wondrous Jacob Tremblay from ""Room"" and ""The Book of Henry"" is brilliant as Auggie. He has Treacher-Collins Syndrome (a craniofacial disorder) and has survived 27 surgeries. After being home-schooled for half his life by his mom, Isabel (Julia Roberts. still luminous and radiant as ever), he is sent to public school for the first time, with a little help from her, his dad, Nate (Owen Wilson) and his sister, Via (Izabela Vidovic), who has always been there for him. As soon as he goes to school, he immediately gets picked on and bullied because of his appearance. Some kids, including Jack Will (Noah Jupe) and Summer (Millie Davis) accepts him for who he is. Even some of the staff, including English teacher, Mr. Browne (Daveed Diggs from ""Hamilton"") and the principal, Mr. Tushman (Mandy Patinkin) cares for him. But some, including bully Julian (Bryce Gheisar), don't like him. As the story progresses, we get to see the different perspectives of each of the characters, family and friends, who will leave an impact in Auggie's life in moments that are good and bad. Only then, Auggie will unlock the power of acceptance and friendship in order for him to truly find his place in the world. ""Wonder"" is a tough-minded film that reminded so much of how I used to love the classic family films I grew up with. A movie that doesn't dwell on special effects, talking animals or a big budget, but has deeper thoughts and real themes that enthralls the inner kid in all of us. It's moving, funny and tenderhearted in an authentic way that shows us that we have to see through the eyes and soul of another person, rather than seeing what that person looks like. It also helps by having a great writer/director and a terrific, well-chosen cast (including poignant turns from Danielle Rose Russell and Nadji Jeter, who plays Via's friend and first love, respectfully and a brief cameo from Sonia Braga as the Pullmans' grandmother) who care for this story that it never goes over the top with the emotions and it never goes down a conventional, melodramatic and saccharine path. Every moment of emotion fits like a puzzle and convincingly flows in every scene. Auggie said, ""We all deserve a standing ovation at least once in our lives."" I say, we should all give a standing ovation to both book and movie of ""Wonder"", because like its characters that gets their moments of pure humanity and, of course, dear little Auggie, this story is a wonder. I will never forget this movie and I hope that families around the world who have always wanted to stand out from the crowd, no matter how different they are, will do the same."
I absolutely fell in love with the story of this movie. I went to the premier last night and didn't really know what to expect. I was very pleasantly surprised. I don't consider myself an emotional movie watcher but I almost lost it 3 times and I laughed more than I could remember. The story line was very easy to follow along. I did not lose interest not one time. I was so impressed with the children actors. A very beautifully written and directed movie. Must watch for the whole family.
"Simply put, this is the perfect family film for all ages. Outstanding acting by little Canadian phenom Jacob Tremblay as well as a great supporting cast. Very well written and directed. A must see film. 9/10 from me"
"So simple the history, but so we'll explained! A progression of empathy and love 🙏"
"On the surface, this movie seems beautiful - little boy with deformities is bullied at school for this appearance, but his strength and character make him go ahead and he suddenly has lots of friends and people at school supporting him. That's not exactly what happens in real life, and that's what pissed me off.I was bullied during my childhood and teenagehood, both in middle and high school, only because I was the classroom nerd. I didn't even have a deformity and I was tortured by verbal and physical abuse, and the children were relentless and merciless. Not a single one dared have some empathy for me or tried to talk to me. They'd be more and more cruel everyday, and the school's principal didn't give a damn about my situation either. That's because I was only a nerd! Now imagine what it'd be like for a child with a facial deformity in real life.I know this movie wants to be motivating and wants to spread the message about being yourself and respecting other. I also see solid performances by Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson. But this movie is not realistic. Bullying is much worse than that and bullied kids suffer much more than that."
"Firstly, I know there are some people with real facial disfigurements who are upset that the child wasn't played by someone with a real facial disfigurement, I can understand why. But as I have unilateral cleft palate myself which is similar, and that I have faced much discrimination throughout life, I feel that it was appropriate to cast a non disfigured child for the role. Why?As unlike a child actor without disfigurement, he wouldn't be able to clean the movie makeup off afterwards. Therefore other kids and even adults in the real world would assume that the young actor is still in character, and bullied even more for it. The movie would only enforce the focus even more on his real life disfigurement in the real world and less on the young actor who played him. Therefore I feel that it was a wise insightful appropriate move. If it was an adult character then I would question it...Anyway back to the movie.It was...okay. But it didn't nail the true reality. I identified with a few things especially the bullying. But as I suspected this movie would be which is a major problem of what a lot of these kind of movies have, it feels much too sanitised.The kid dealt with it a lot better than I did, a lot better than many do. But maybe it is partly because he has the unrealistic perfect movie parents and idyllic family life, and of course as I also suspected would happen he receives a standing ovation from the whole school at the end and everybody is now his friend. As Gargamel would say ""How sickeningly sweet!"".In the real world quite often the bullying is relentless right to the end where even teachers and head teachers don't do a damn thing, and even victim blame, and that it often continues into adult life with even more discrimination. I know this from hard experiences.Another thing, as somebody else pointed out and I agree, the main character ""Auggie"" started talking about how you can tell someone from their shoes. Trust fund kid, crazy kid, hand-me-down kid.....Why would he judge others on their appearance when he gets similar treatment himself? I realise the narrative is probably there to suggest that everybody can be unfairly stereotyped, but for me in the real world I think we with severe facial disfigurements have learned to be less superficial than that.I for one would like to watch a real hard hitting gritty realistic movie, from childhood through to adulthood where it doesn't have the perfect sanitised happy TV movie ending. Not necessarily a really sad unhappy ending, but at least an ending where it shows that he or she as an adult has learned life's harsh lessons the hard way through the continuing bigotry of others through life. Show the world what many of us still go through.The child actor should again be played by someone who isn't disfigured for real for the reasons I gave, but an adult actor who is more emotionally mature and equipped to deal with the cruel comments in the real world should be played by an actor who is.""Wonder"" is a sweet movie with good intentions, worth watching the once and it does show a degree of empathy which we need more of these days, but it is still typical TV movie syrupy and sanitised melodrama stuff, that isn't near realistic enough. I hope one day it might inspire a more insightful educating movie and portray the true harsh reality of living with facial disfigurements (and maybe even added speech impairment) even if it alarms and shocks people. It would send a more powerful message and that would be a good thing.5/10"
"13 November 2017 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Wonder. Today is world kindness day and a link appeared on Facebook offering free tickets at cinemas across the country to see a special pre-release preview of this beautiful film. Wonder is the story of Auggie Pullman who is born different. Home schooled, his mother feels it's time for him to enter mainstream education and he joins the 5th grade. People can be cruel and kids can be cruellest of all and Auggie struggles in a world where everyone stares and whispers and even bullies. It's not only Auggie who struggles however, as the film progresses we are told the story from different angles, that of Auggie himself, his sister, his sister's friend and his own new friend. All have issues which are both affected and unaffected by the way Auggie looks. This is a heartwarming tale, based on a New York Times bestselling book. Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson play the parents who love their son fiercely and ache for his anguish and rejoice in his successes as he finds his way in the world of the 5th grade. I urge you to go and see this, easy to watch and the characters are all endearing in their own way, even the bullies. I believe it's on general release at the beginning of December."
"""Wonder"" is a touching story about August ""Auggie"" Pullman who is born with a genetic disorder that required numerous surgeries to enable to him to function, not to mention is facial disfigurement. Auggie is a sweet boy who has a loving family who don't treat him any differently, especially his mother (beautifully played by Julia Roberts). While he is home-schooled for most of his life, she finally decides that it's time for him to go to school, much to the initial dismay of his father (Owen Wilson) who is fearful about how he might be treated. Auggie also has a loving, but lonely sister, Via (incredible performance by Izabela Vidovic) who adores her brother but finds herself feeling like she's on the sidelines of the family due to the attention her parents give Auggie.Of course, much of the story is about Auggie integrating into school and the challenges he faces, especially socially. While it works very well, we are given some somewhat ""cliched"" characters here. We have the bully who can only make fun of him. We have the sweet girl (Summer) who likes him but is initially afraid to show it, and we have the boy who is a friend but is peer-pressured into hurting Auggie. The triumph of the performances really must go to Jacob Tremblay (Auggie) and Izabela Vidovic. Both of these actors have bright futures ahead of them. The film is touching and it interestingly enough, decides to use much of the story to share the perspectives of the main characters, telling the story from their points of view. While this was a good way to delve into the mindsets of these characters, and give us some depth as far as they are concerned, the movie ends up missing out on a golden opportunity.It seems that most filmmakers these days are trying to tell touching stories without becoming overly sentimental or being bogged down in melodrama. It is a fine line, but when you are afraid of delving deeper, you risk leaving your story too much on the surface. The movie would have been much stronger had they focused on Auggie entirely, and leave the exploration of the other characters to function and grow through their interactions with him. I found myself wanting more Auggie! I wanted deeper situations with his family, his friends, and the trials and tribulations of integrating into a middle school environment. Movies that do this well are movies that audiences end up cheering for. Still, the movie works, for the most part, and it should be a ""must- see"" for anyone who has been bullied or anyone who has been a bully. Most people still don't get how truly terrible and horrific bullying is."
"I cried warm tears all throughout this movie! My heart is warmed, this was overwhelming and well done! This movie was a great example of kindness and respect, and it's for all ages!"
"When you learn that a movie's premise is about a young boy with facial differences, you know it's going to tug at your heart strings, wet your eyes, and put a lump in your throat. On those notes, Wonder delivers in a big way. Wonder tells the story of Augie Bloom (Jacob Tremblay), a 10-year-old boy who attends school for the first time, after his mother (Julia Roberts) had previously home-schooled him. His journey hits all the affecting, though predictable notes. He encounters bullies, a nice kid, an understanding and comforting principle, and a hip young teacher who possesses the wisdom of someone much older. Nothing on Augie's journey's will surprise you, but I challenge you to resist the emotional ebbs and flows along the way. That's the movie's main objective. It wants to make you cry and it succeeds in doing so. Aside from a few occasions in which it resorts to shameless manipulations, you won't feel too terribly about giving in to the feel-goodness. The performances are sincere, even if the actors are more so playing clichés than thoughtfully-formed characters. Julia Roberts shines are the tough and loving mother. Owen Wilson plays the dad with his familiar cool guy with a big heart routine. It works. While he plays a supporting role in Augie's life compared to mom, he keys some of the pivotal moments of Augie's growth. Augie's sister Via (Isabela Vidovic) dutifully asks little of her parents, knowing how much work and attention they must give to her brother. The best part of the movie is that we see multiple perspectives, like that of Via. Several times during the movie, a different character's name appears on screen and we see his or her story. Via is one. Augie's friend Jack Will (Noah Jupe, tremendous young actor) is another. Via's best friend's personal story, who inexplicably distances herself from Via this school year, is the most illuminating. Director Stephen Chbosky's makes a wise choice to cover the story from other points of view. From this we can see not only Augie's story, but also the impact that he has on others. Though I'd like to have seen the material speak for itself more often, rather forced upon viewers in a way that feels, well, forced. We're going to feel sorrow during Augie's struggles and uplifted during his triumphs. Additional attempts to emotionally manipulate aren't necessary. Luckily, they don't overshadow the movie's warm moments or its wonderful message. The winning moments outnumber the sigh-worthy ones. And the overall effect is charming. Augie really is a great kid. It's okay to shed a tear and smile."
"A Hollywood movie about a deformed boy battling adversities starring Owen Wilson? Yes, it's exactly as predictable as it sounds. I hate to sound like a cynical old man (I'm actually only 22 with the mind of a fifty year-old whoops) but I've sat through my fair share of schmaltz which mainstream audiences seem to lap up. People seem to be completely sucked in by the manipulative tearjerkers which we've seen over the past few decades such as My Sisters Keeper and Marley and Me, but ultimately, they're sentimental nonsense and therefore phony.Wonder is the 'heart-warming true story' of a boy who has a facial disfigurement and affects the lives of those around him. In all fairness, Wonder isn't a bad film. It's well-made and entertaining enough but certainly isn't anything memorable. It feels like an Oscar-bait movie but I have a suspicious feeling that Stephen Chbosky will be winning as many Oscars as he did for his previous debut, The Perks of Being a Wallflower.It's likely to gain comparisons to the superior 1985 film, Mask due to having a central character facing similar issues. However whilst Mask handled the subject with maturity and objectiveness, Wonder smothers on the treacle and treats the audience like children who have an irrational phobia of people whose appearances are abnormal. In that sense, Wonder is a fantastic film for children to see and I was delighted to see plenty at my free screening with their tight parents.So the film basically ticks off every cliché in the book. Deformed boy gets bullied, deformed boy finds friend and then falls out with said friend, deformed boy gets new friend etc. but it was nice to see a focus on other characters such as his neglected sister. It's interesting though how the other big character, Julian doesn't get a similar backstory. Maybe it has something with him being a two- dimensional bully?No doubt audiences are going weep and applaud, and the film will do well at the box office. However, I prefer my movies with a sense of Haneke-realism to them. The saddest films I've seen feature absolute zero sentimentality. Requiem for a Dream rips your heart out and stamps on it. If Wonder wanted a similar effect, then it failed miserably. As a children's film however, it's fabulous and carries an extremely positive message which wraps itself in a lovely bow in the finish."
"Wonder is the story of Auggie Pullman (Jacob Tremblay) a boy born with severe facial deformities as he goes to school for the first time in fifth grade. Middle school is probably the least forgiving environment he could be entering, as anyone who has ever met an eleven year old could tell you, but he has a strong support network with his parents (Owen Wilson and Julia Roberts) and his sister (Izabela Vidovic). If the story had only focused on Auggie it would have been good, but what set it apart was that it branched out. A lot of time is devoted to his sister, Via, as she is also facing a tough transition in her life as she begins high school. She is used to having to take care of herself because Auggie requires so much attention and she is able to put her own problems on the backburner to be there to support her little brother.They also look through the eyes of some of Auggie and Via's friends to see how Auggie has impacted their lives. This really helps the viewer connect with the film and really makes it work as a engrossing and heartwarming picture."
"Having read other reviews that criticize that this movie is not realistic, I felt the urge to write my very first review here. I was thinking about the following questions: 
does this movie have to be realistic? what if it shows us an ideal to strive after?wouldn't ""Wonder"" be a good title?In my opinion this movie is not necessarily realistic (yet) but optimistic. It does not have to be realistic, because it is (of course) a fictional movie and showing something most people will not have experienced in their lives. Here, I'm especially referring to people that got bullied at school. All too often, those people are left alone and stuck in their situation. Over years, they may get permanently threatened, often with no or very few external help. The reasons for that are manyfold, but often boil down to something superficial. I do know that - not really from the bullied but from the bully side.Back at my school days, it did happen that I was in groups bullying minorities. At those moments, we felt stronger, I guess. But with hindsight, I felt actually bad, knowing that even the slightest participation in such things is bad. Even looking away is bad.Courage is what I was missing at these days, and I regretted it. This movie shows even ""stupid"" people like me that there is a way out and people can manage to act differently. In that sense the movie is optimistically showing an ideal. But people often need to be taken by the hand, to be shown alternative ways of behaving, so they can strive after such behavior. This movie reminded me of that, and it felt good watching it. Even if the movie nowadays has to be titled ""Wonder"", it is a step towards making this wonder come alive. Believe in it!"
"It's early in the 2017 Holiday and Christmas season--well, at least from a normal person's perspective, not a retailer's perspective--and we now have a holiday film well worth taking time away from all the hubbub to enjoy. After being thoroughly depressed by ""A Bad Moms Christmas"" (even though I normally love a season-tweaking R-rated comedy during the holidays) seeing ""Wonder"" was (yes, I know what I'm about to say is a cliché, but it fits this particular film perfectly) like a cold, bracing, and refreshing breath of fresh air. The less you know about it before viewing the more joyous your viewing experience will be, so I'll just say it's one holiday film I hope will become an annual tradition along with the likes of ""It's A Wonderful Life, ""White Christmas,"" and ""A Christmas Story."" While ""Wonder"" is not specifically meant as a ""Christmas"" or holiday film, it fits the more joyous and kind themes of the holiday season that are supposedly the core reason we even bother to celebrate them."
"If you liked the book, you'll definitely like the movie.
Its a very strong movie"
"Greetings again from the darkness. What a pleasant surprise and crowd-pleasing treat from director Stephen Chbosky! Ordinarily, if you tell me a Julia Roberts – Owen Wilson movie is opening, I would experience nightmares of Malcolm McDowell in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE with his eyelids forced open by metal prongs attached to a head immobilizer (Don't expect any other reviews of this film to reference the Kubrick classic). It's based on the New York Times bestseller and it's a throwback to the days of sweet message films that don't require explanations before recommending.""I can't wait for Halloween!"" exclaims Auggie. While it's not difficult to imagine any kid looking forward to this big day, very few would share Auggie's reason. Through narration, he informs us that he's ""not an ordinary kid"". After a startling birth, he's been through 27 surgeries. Auggie has genetic facial deformities, and it's not the Halloween candy he anticipates; it's the one day with a level- playing field for him, as other kids wear their costume masks and he can simply blend in. Feel the tug on the heartstrings yet? You will.Jacob Tremblay (ROOM) plays Auggie, and Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson play his loving parents. Until now, he's been home-schooled by Mom, but it's 5th grade and time for ""real"" school. Auggie's older sister Via is played beautifully by Izabela Vidovic. This is very much her story as well. She carries a burden that few understand, and even briefly finds peace in her fabricated time as an ""only child"". Previously, she had described Auggie as the sun, and the rest of the family as orbiting planets. Not only is it a wonderful performance from Miss Vidovic, but kudos to the filmmakers for casting a 16 year old actress as a high schooler. Typically these roles go to actors in their mid-20's (a pet peeve of mine).The film kicks into gear, and we really begin to get to know Auggie, once school starts. Mandy Patinkin plays the principal Mr. Tushman (a name he embraces), and we get the expected nice kid Jack Will (Noah Jupe), the rich bully Julian (Bryce Gheisar), and the popular girl Charlotte (Elle McKinnon). Some of the characters have various segments of the film named after them, and though these are quite loosely told, they do provide some semblance of structure to the film and keep viewers focused on the diverse personalities. A Science Fair, field trip and school play (Our Town) each provide critical turning points, and of course, most of the film is based on Auggie's impact on those whose path he crosses.Although we are subjected to one of Julia Roberts' patented cackles, it doesn't ruin the sentiment or message that Auggie delivers. Daveed Diggs has a nice turn as a teacher, and the always wonderful Sonia Braga makes a much-too-brief appearance. Director Chbosky previously gave us the gem THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER, and this time out he allows us to explore the fragility of friendship and family, and the importance of toughness in an individual. The ending is pure Hollywood, but we should accept the crowd-pleasing cheesiness and be thankful for a pleasant, entertaining family movie.""We need a renaissance of wonder. We need to renew, in our hearts and in our souls, the deathless dream, the eternal poetry, the perennial sense that life is miracle and magic."" - E. Merrill Root (1895 - 1973) American Writer"
That's really all I have. Awesome. It was riveting!
"This is just a wonderful story to watch with your family. Nothing sexual, nothing violent, just a nice, positive and optimistic story. One of the best I watched recently."
"The casual moviegoer might enjoy Wonder. It is light, happy, and heartwarming. It teaches children to be more sensitive to other kids' problems and insecurities. The morality of the movie was blatant and instructive.The problem was that in teaching a lesson, Wonder completely overstated the point. The movie wants us to view Auggie as a whole, dynamic person rather than as a deformed boy, but it gives us little motivation to do so. We do not connect with Auggie. He seems distant and too focused on his own problem for us to relate to him. We rarely see his fun, smart, confident side - the traits that make a movie character likable. The movie has little depth. One would think that a movie focused on exploring the emotional struggle of a misfit kid could provide more heart-rending, memorable conflict, but Auggie only seemed to feel real sadness once - when his best friend turned on him - and even then the movie did not inspect his feelings close enough for us to be truly moved.Wonder had potential to be a good movie, but in the end it never gave us the depth of conflict that we deserved."
"Reminds me in parts to ""Mask"". An example of never judging a book by its cover.A little sentimental and schmaltzy in parts , which is very much the American way of making films, but if this is overlooked and the film is taken at face value then it is very interesting. It shows how children can be cruel but also how disfigurement can be overcome by warmth of character. My wife was glued to it which is very rare. Very much a Ladies film but I also enjoyed it.
 Julia Roberts is her typical self - excellent , Owen Wilson shows a warmer side not usually portrayed but without doubt the most touching performance ( and worthy of recognition ) is Auggie - Jacob Tremblay. A future star in the making if ever there was one."
"I've used IMDB for years to check reviews of movies and have never left a review until now. This will be a very short review. Great acting, the movie flowed very well, was very enjoyable, had me tear up at momments...overall great movie. Anyone, who rated this below a 7 has issues, inner demons that they need to deal with before writing another review. Yes, it is a feel good movie because of the happy ending but who cares? That does not take away from the story. I watch mostly action/syfy movies and this had my attention the entire time."
"""Wonder"" is one of those emotional films that make you feel good in the end. The story of an outcast ten year-old boy with facial deformation that outdoes his schoolmates and becomes cherished in the end is a great entertainment although unrealistic. A school with only one wicked child is absolutely unusual and hard to believe. But the film is worthwhile watching, with Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson showing outstanding chemistry and nice characters. It is funny to see the fashion in the studios with Caucasian and Afro-American couples. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Extraordinário"" (""Extraordinary"")"
"WONDER (2017) *** Jacob Tremblay, Julia Roberts, Owen Wilson, Izabela Vidovic, Mandy Patinkin, Noah Jupe, Bryce Gheisar, Elle McKinnon, Daveed Diggs, Ty Consiglio, Millie Davis, Danielle Rose Russell, Sonia Braga. Inspiring and emotionally charged story about a young boy named Auggie (the incredible Tremblay) with a congenital facial deformity who enters public school for the first time after being home schooled by his loving parents (Roberts and Wilson, both solid) and facing the real world as well. Based on the best seller by RJ Palacio, filmmaker Stephen Chbosky - who co-adapted with Steve Conrad and Jack Thorne - gets some truly wonderful performances from his young actors overall and balances the treacle with heartfelt warmth, compassion and never forgetting the theme - Just Be Kind."
"In essence it's a feel-good film with life-affirming, heart-warming tendencies and the usual core themes of family, friendship and discovering your true self, seen in most of these coming-of-age dramas, alongside its more unique yet universal subjects of inclusion, equality and general kindness, and the flick always does a decent job of making its characters and their issues both believable and empathetic but never manages to get out of the general generic space we've seen so many times before; on top of this is an over-reliance on at times heavy-handed, 'tell-not-show' narration - the oldest narrative conceit in the book, this time most likely lifted straight from the book on which the piece is based - and the odd choice to throw up character name title cards as pseudo chapter-breaks (more than likely another hold-out from the source novel) but then not adhere to them in any consistent or meaningful way, still the feature is enjoyable and occasionally somewhat affecting despite its short-comings and overly long run-time, something not at all helped by its generally unfocused and plot- light nature. 6/10"
"I couldn't wait for the movie to end. Poor acting, extremely predictable."
"WARNING- The ending if this film is so sugar coated that you will become diabetic.This film is basically saying 'Life sucks whether you have a facial deformity or not'. Julia Roberts is great (as per). Owen Wilson is in a film that isn't an utter embarrassment for once (way to go). But the film feels like an overlong episode from some bright and breezy TV show. Theres no real depth even though the subject of someone being different could be examined perceptively in relation to human nature and people's vicious pack mentality.Theres also some vile stereotyping going on here. All the bullies within the film are white and stinking rich. The goodies either have a facial deformity, are related to him, aren't white or are a member of another religion (the Jewish headmaster). Social justice filmmaking. Urgh. If John Waters had made this film, the lead character would have accentuated his unique looks, dressed in drag and owned this film. Maybe Mr Waters could remake this. In fact I think hes already made that film- it had songs, dance routines, Divine and was called Hairspray. Watch Mask instead. You get Cher and bikers thrown in as well."
"""Wonder"": This elevator only goes down""Wonder"" stars the standout Jason Tremblay of Room. This time, he's grown up and plays Auggie, a 5th Grader and not a five year old as he did in Room. The other standouts include Noah Jupe as Jack, his friend, Bryce Gheisar as Julian, his bully, and Izabela Vidovic as Via (Olivia), his sister. Owen Wilson snarks his way though the film with a some decent dialogue and not much else. Julia Roberts is okay and only slightly nauseating as the mother. Again, the dialogue elevated her performance until the last scenes. In the end, ""Wonder"" fell apart like a cheap computer that has just passed it's warranty date. Stephen Chbosky's directing of ""Wonder,"" based on the book by R.J. Palacio, is okay, but nothing special. The writing saves a few scenes, the dialogue at least, but the ending ruined a perfectly decent film. The music was too loud and overbearing, especially during the last unbelievable moments of a film the writers ruined by making sure we were all uplifted by the special moment. In fact, the events in the film for Auggie, a physically deformed boy from birth, pass too easily and with few complications. It would have made a great after-school special, a cliché insult that is totally appropriate here. The start of the movie brought us into the drama in an interesting manner by slowly introducing us to Auggie, his issues, and his challenges going to school. Another thing the film does well is show how the drama played just not for Auggie, the child with the genetic disfigurement, but how it affects his sister, his sister's best friend Miranda and his friend Jake. My mom said ""Wonder"" was long. It seemed long, although it was less than two hours. That's not a good sign. If I were to rate the movie from the first third, I would say pay full price. But after thinking about the ending of the film I have to rate it lower. Rating: Rent it. The maudlin ending ruined a well constructed opening. But don't blame Tremblay or the other child actors. Blame the writers and director who seemed to think they needed a rousing, over the top ending to sell tickets to a film-going public he seems to think are emotionally retarded. Peace, Tex"
"""Wonder"" is definitely one of the best movies of this year. It is about a boy named August / Auggie, who has facial differences ; he has gone through 27 surgeries since birth. The movie focuses mainly on the time when Auggie is sent to a regular school by his Mom, against Auggie's Dad's wishes. Auggie faces all types of obstacles / problems that an individual experiences among a group of similar-looking people ; being stared / frowned at , being accepted with doubts and suspicions , being bullied. However, Auggie is a tough-minded and intelligent person, and finally manages to gain genuine acceptance by most of his schoolmates and other people in the community.Jacob Tremblay plays Auggie ; he has really given a very fine, artistic and genuine performance as a boy with facial differences / deformities. Owen Wilson has given a decent performance as Auggie's daddy ; however, he has been denied a fair deal because Owen's role is very limited in the movie. Julia Roberts sparkles in the role of Auggie's Mom. Izabella plays the role of Auggie's sister, and she also excels in her role.The director, Mr Chbosky , has done an inspirational work in this movie. He has captured the sweetness and healing effects of feel-good films like this lovable ""Wonder"". Mr Chbosky uses a round-robin chapter style of story-telling ; some segments of the movie are named after certain characters. He has also managed to squeeze out good performances from all actors in the movie. I would love to become a story-writer for movies, because I have also got some interesting and inspirational stories in my mind."
"I watched this film with a school group, and while it has a good lesson in it, the lesson feels very forced. The screenwriters seemed to pick out the best quotes from the novel and squeeze as many as them as they could into the screenplay. A lot of the narration was unnecessary, the film tells you what happens instead of showing. The chapter structure seemed unnecessary as well; it was not unusual for a character's chapter to give said character five minutes of screen time at the start, but forget whose chapter it is halfway through. The last forty-five minutes of the movie is Miranda's chapter, but she is only mentioned shortly in the start, barely being developed while the film expects us to sympathize with her. The jokes are dumb, and August's character made me wince. There were a lot of clichés in it as well, but there were some unintentionally funny scenes, such as the scene where Miranda stares into August's window for five minutes creating a hilariously campy shot. I could also add the hilarious group Minecraft session to this list as well. However there was some good cinematography, with nice shots of Coney Island, and Jack blocked behind a statue of an angel to signify his kindness. Overall, the movie is cliché, annoying, and boring."
"With all the crap the film industry puts out today, you really have to wonder if we'll ever see a masterpiece ever again. Perhaps I'm showing my age here but I think the best movies (genre aside) were created in the 90's. Why I didn't watch this movie sooner is my only regret. What a brilliant movie! Sure it's predictable. It's your typical feel good movie but it comes with a valuable lesson for both adults and children and really hits home for many reasons. I'm glad I watched this alone though... grown, 30 year old male, welling up every 10 mins. And I usually hate movies like this. I much prefer horror, thriller and comedy but I'm glad I watched this. Definitely a film I'll be adding to my collection. Ironically, this is exactly why you should never judge a book (or movie in this case) by its cover. Maybe they still make movies like they used to."
"Today we are looking at a movie called ""Wonder"" which is a surprise because it is no ""Wonder"" how bad this movie is. Here is a basic summary: A child name August who has a facial disorder must go to school for the first time after being home schooled his whole life. He gets picked on by a bunch of Bullies and the main person the story focuses on changes people from time to time. From Augusts sister to Augusts old friend and so on. Now that that is out of the way let's talk turkey.So, by now you must be thinking ""What makes this movie so bad?"" Boy, will I tell you what! This movie is loaded with product placements. Right now from just watching the movie once, trying (and failing) to enjoy it I found 6 product placements! From Nintendo, Mojang, Microsoft, Acer, Google, and Apple! If they cared about raising awareness (about the fact that everyone is equal I think) they wouldn't litter the movie with paid advertisements! To make it worse every single heartfelt or serious moment is insensitively ruined by a burp or fart joke, the most lowbrow and immature humor out there. This movie is a corporate trap. All the people who watch this movie will think they are supporting a message of equality but they are just filling the big heartless companies' leather wallets with cash. Sad speaking of which, just a little thing to add, the message of this movie is very blurred, is it 'Everyone is equal', 'Beauty goes deeper than the surface', or the oh so classic 'never judge a book by its cover? The message is very clouded. Anyway, I am sorely disappointed with this movie. It even has boring 2d text transitions that a 4th grader could make. This movie did not live up to my expectations at all. Even the fight scenes that are the only parts that I enjoyed, still looked fake. To summarize this movie was a disappointing cash grab. But all the other reviewers will like this movie because they feel like they are supporting a 'good cause' and to that this seasoned reviewer I don't think so! I would not recommend this movie to people like me but all the other average Joes and normies out there: Give it a watch!"
"After reading some of the reviews for this movie, I am ashamed at how vapid, and un-empathetic the human race can be. Unfortunately, people have very narrow minds. The message to the movie is great. This is motivational to give you the strength to say, if he can do it, then what do I have to complain about, and hopefully that message is enough. However, after reading some of the negative reviews I can see that people are miserable and their narrow minds do not allow them to see the bigger picture. People do not understand that in order for people to actually learn to accept people who are different, then society and the media have to paint a picture depicting how easy it can be. The same thing can be said for gay people. Without the media painting the picture that it is ok to be gay, and accept gay people, I feel like it wouldn't happen quite as easily as it is nowadays. This movie shows kids that there are people out there who have deformities, or differences, and it is ok to accept them, because they too are people and can be loved. Shame on the people who have reviewed the movie and were not able to realize this concept even if they were bullied and find it unrealistic. Times have changed. And for those who have no tact, well this review isn't going to help you learn tact or be a better person, therefore not for you. Sadly, the people writing the negative reviews will have, or do have children, thus perpetuate the cycle until one day they or someone they know and love turns out to be different."
"Ok so i read most of the reviews saw the imdb rating and thought ""OK, might be a gude movie to check out with my sweetie. Alot of the reviews mentioned feel good, tears, family etc. and I like most of Wilson and whats her names movies. So i settle in and await the entertainment. Suffice to say it NEVER came. NOT ONCE...Mom and dad have an ugly kid. The ugly kids has an older sister. They all love ugly kid. Ugly kid wears a space suit helmet, but only sometimes?? He timidly enters School wondering how its going to go. Much to my shock and awe. The kids stare at him and make fun /sarc. Shocking right? He makes friends he loses friends. He is teased, made fun of behind his back. WoW...like none of us has ever had to endure that as a kid. I was totally emotionless through the entire movie. I didnt really care about the kid his parents nor his sister. oH wait,...then they bring in one of the sisters friends who suddenly stops being friends with the ugly kids sister..Why? dunno...they never really clearly spell it out..Cliched, vacuous, boring, empty, predictable, Not for adults. Caveat. If you have kids 12 and under probably a pretty gude time waster for them."
"Such wonderful movies need a huge clap in front of the entire audience !!
A movie that makes us learn who we really are.... i cannot watch the end without tears in my eyes...
Hats off to the entire crew and the boy Auggie in general !!!!!!"
This is a very great film I think this fim show the life of litle boy that difference from other children. It is a very drama story I think but on the other hand this film make the idea for the life to. If you like drama film you will like this film too.
"Prepare to cry, then to cry a bit more and then a little bit more crying after that."
"I don't care who you are-you MUST see this movie! It's probably cliche for me to say a movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen(I say that often due to my high love for movies), but I MUST say that here!This is one of the Top 10 best movies I have ever seen, the most inspirational movie I have ever seen as well!Now what is this great movie about? The realistic fiction movie focuses on August Pullman, a boy with a facial deformity who goes to a public school for the 1st time in 5th grade. While he is there- he faces bullies, stares, and other related issues with his schoolmates. After a while, however, he starts to make friends and gets acceptance for who he is, not what he looks like.That may sound a bit redundant of a message, and sure, it is. However, I think this is the best way it has ever been told. To quote film critic Christy Lemire: ""Director Stephen Chbosky has managed to take a story that could have been painfully mawkish and made it genuinely moving in (mostly) understated ways.""I must also applaud the movie for this: Wonder is one of the few movies that have ever made me cry. I cried for 4 reasons:1. There were sad moments.2. There were happy cry moments.3. There were moments that were happy AND sad.4. The movie ended. Yes, I seriously cried because the credits rolled!While my face is not deformed, I can relate to August in multiple ways: I too have been teased for being unattractive and other similar aspects like Auggie.I don't usually applaud acting, but I adored Jacob Trembaly's performance as Auggie. Other actors like Julia Roberts, Owen Wilson, and Mandy Patinkin, and the lesser know kid actors do a fantastic job as well!If you have not seen Wonder, do so as soon as you can! This is the best movie to be released since Silence, my favorite movie! This moving and inspirational movie really is a WONDER! I can't say enough great things about this great movie!Did I mention that this a must see and one of the best movies I have ever seen?"
"I took a chance on this movie because of Julia Roberts. Little did I know it was going to be one of the best movies I've ever seen! It touched on every hot topic about raising children without belaboring on any of them. It showed how tough things can be when it's nobody's fault. I cried through most of the movie I recommend you have tissues nearby. It reminded me of the way I felt after watching ""Pay It Forward"" but with a better ending. If you know of any kid who is going through feeling different because of a genetic disorder, disfigurement, disability, etc., this movie shows a great attitude on how to handle bullies and deal with people who cannot see past the obvious. I especially love this movie because it shows that bullies are a minority, very small minority, and standing up to them can set things right if you do it the right way. I highly recommend this as a family movie."
This brought back so much. I was the invisible sister to four brothers who had Duchenes Muscular Dystrophy. People stared where ever we went but no one ever saw me. That was ok though because I got be their sister. There was no such thing as normal. I just wish I could have shared watching this with my Mom.
"Cried like 5 times and I'm a 30 yr old male, loved the message great movie and great acting"
"Great message, if only it would reach those that really need to hear it. Unfortunately people in real life are far too much like the bully's parents.Worth a rental."
"To make a family drama Is really hard I guess. make it feel contemporary
and realistic to the modern day families. This movie also has two story arcs.
One follow the boy and one the daughter. And this Is really annoying and 
they jump between this very strange unessecary introduction.
Ok first of all Wonder Is about the boy and follow his life but nothing makes sense. No kids speaks like this in their age. I now for a fact NO kids are that much Into science either, no kid in school cared.. Its unrealistic to the point of ridiculus. 
The arents hush hush at home and neglect the daughter and just keep on whimpering about worrying all the time for the boy. These are the worst kind of parents you can think of if yourself was a kid. Theyre good as explainig to the kid whats right and wrong and how to stand up for himself, all thats good, but they spend too much time not letting him experience anything. And thats why hes wearing hisspace helmet still. Life Is hard, but they just make it harder on themselves and the kids. The story of the daughter Is much more interesting but never leads anywhere really. In the end Wonder feels like the typical disney version of what a family should be. I love jlia roberts also but I found her to be very boring in this."
Very good story. Every child in school should watch this and hopefully it would make them treat each other better.
"A great movie, with real life problems, a very good example to people, a wake-up call for many of us that forget what is more important in life, and that includes kindness, respect, love and understanding!"
"First of all, I would like to give a standing ovation to Jacob Tremblay. I watched this movie that one night when I was really stressed about my thesis and yeah, this made me really happy. It's not boring and redundant. It is light and heartwarming. A must watch."
"The thing I enjoyed the most about Wonder was how this wasn't just Auggie's story. I would have liked a movie just based around Auggie because of his willingness to keep getting up and trying to roll with the punches. But this movie is told from the perspectives of several characters and I was astounded at how well the movie fleshes out all the people we interact with. We learn about Auggie's sister Via and despite the fact she loves her brother dearly, she is battling her own resentment towards her parents because of the lack of attention that she gets. This is just a sampling, we get some time with a few more characters narrating and telling the story of what they see. I didn't just feel for Auggie, I felt for everyone and there were several moments that had me almost tearing up when Auggie wasn't even onscreen. I can't understate how effective the movie is at showing things from all angles and who would have thought you would get such great character development from a live action movie so obviously geared toward families?Another thing I appreciated about Wonder is that it takes the time to show that not every problem gets wrapped up in a neat little bow. Auggie faces real struggles and sure, he conquers most of them, but it is far from a walk in the park. He faces constant insults and threats, friends turn on him and he has to gradually earn the respect of the rest of the kids. Some of the kids face pressure because they can't afford to be at this school and stepping out of line means having a scholarship yanked. Others have inattentive parents who are more concerned with themselves and they have to overcompensate to hide their pain. This movie is about these kids (and adults like Auggie's mother and father Isabel and Nate) dealing with this plight on a continual basis and other than the movie ending on a sweet note, it pulls far fewer punches than I expected it to.Wonder also does a good job of walking a tightrope when it comes to the tone of the movie. There are scenes that are really funny and warm your heart. Soon after however, there's going to be something that sends you crashing back down to earth. The movie never gets too upbeat to be cheesy but never gets too weighed down to be a straight drama. Much like Auggie's life, we go through the suspected highs and lows and we even have a few unexpected twists to keep things interesting (if you haven't seen the trailer there's a cameo by a favourite Star Wars character).Wonder was able to attract some big names to populate the cast. Jacob Tremblay plays Auggie and he continues his impressive run. He's great for a kid actor and getting the emotion across under heavy makeup would be difficult for a great adult actor. He does outstanding work as Auggie. Izabel Vidovic is also really good as his sister Via. She has almost as enriching of a character and she gets across the bittersweet nature of Via's existence well. Julia Roberts did a much better job as Isabel than I thought she would. She's a great actress but I would have thought she would have been sleepwalking through this. She still oozes charm and she clearly came to work. The same goes for Owen Wilson who gets the short end of the stick with the screen time. He's still does exemplary work though. Credit should also go to Noah Jupe as Auggie's friend Jack and Danielle Rose Russell as Via's former friend Miranda.I had little to no interest in seeing Wonder when I saw the trailer. I rolled my eyes and it looked like a movie that might have been put on the Disney channel if it didn't have big names in the cast. I was completely wrong. This is a great coming-of-age story that teaches lessons about bullying, not judging a book by its cover and how a story changes completely when you switch points of view. The acting was great, the story was involving, the message was good, and it was conveyed in a way that entire families can easily understand. If you had struggles as a kid (bullying, academics, social problems etc.) I can't imagine you won't find something to identify with in this movie, which I know I did. This movie is excellent and if you're not uncomfortable with some heavy drama, I would put this right up there with A Monster Calls as wonderful yet sad movies that families can enjoy."
"Wonder is the plain white sliced bread of inspirational movies - bland, inoffensive and engineered as a light crowd pleaser, to be forgotten the next day. Its lessons and truths are hardly transformative, except maybe for the young readers who were enraptured by the source novel. We know to be kind, and look past surface flaws and deformities. What is especially disappointing is how watered down this is, instead of truly confronting. To cast and then put Auggie up onto the big screen is to force audiences to go through the same thing that all the Beecher Hope kids do, stare down their new freakish classmate. Yet Jacob Tremblay is a ball of cuteness, and you realise you're only grimacing for a second. The makeup is technically excellent but gives Auggie the appearance of a scrunched up puppy, or a half-amphibian toddler. I've seen scarier mascots for insect repellent. It's a Hollywood disability, sanitised for the movie screen. One of the saving graces of RJ Palacio's novel was its carousel of narrative perspectives, outlining how the other figures of Auggie's life are affected by the gravitational pull of his condition, sucking all the attention away from them. This is valuable insight that these sorts of (usually biographical) stories often ignore; the emotional cost and exhaustion of having to be the bigger and better person every single day, and have even slight lapses be demonised by public eye. Voiceovers reveal the secrets and shame behind their seemingly endless pools of patience and empathy, and in a particularly sweet moment, grandma Pullman sees Violet for who she really is: merely a teenager asked to be older and wiser beyond her years, and who has graciously done so. Sometimes playing favourites isn't so bad. This notion is undermined by the rest of the characterisation, which have an annoying tendency to wave off genuine prejudice for fluffy emotional 'growth'. No antagonist is truly an evil person in this story, only misunderstood souls who just need a kick up the empathy backside. The school setting, far from any semblance of reality, houses the usual cinematic bully figures (leaving nasty notes in lockers and so on), and operates under the absurd premise that sooner or later all these bullies will become best friends due to the sheer perseverance and courage of the victim. Bullies can't just be bullies, they all hide a stirring backstory and a lonely voiceover in their minds. Sorry, but kids can and will do much worse to completely normal peers, and to ignore this and spread some naive, happy-go-lucky attitude is nothing but ignorant. Even the dog is an absolute angel; then again, all dogs are, basically motifs for unconditional love. If you ever need some waterworks for your movie, just kill off a dog. Which is exactly what Chbosky does here, after giving Daisy all of two scenes beforehand, for no apparent reason. What grates me most about Wonder is how it comes off as some mandatory information session about workplace bullying and prejudice, with neat, inoffensive scenarios and big, bold instructions telling you exactly what to do and say. The teachers are barely human beings; they act like overexcited robots mimicking motivational speakers, with just the right snappy catchphrase to perk your day up. Sometimes the curriculum is just an excuse for Chbosky to indulge in mystical bird's eye view shots over time lapses. We get it, he's a social outcast. Wonder insists that this is the way the world should work, and in a magical, fictional utopia, perhaps it does, but in the meantime there's a lot work we need to do. Wonder is the safest movie about a socially-ostracising deformity I've seen in a while, with exactly zero risk involved. Write this any other way, and you're basically a monster."
"Don't be fooled by the high score. A horrible, typical American so called movie. Think about how the movie would have turned out if it was shot and screened by a European or an indie movie director."
"I kind of went into this expecting the wrong thing; a more mature film, for adults but about kids; instead it was a mature film for kids about kids. I kind of got concerned about that when all of the trailers going into it were for other kids' movies; then when Wonder itself got going, I got the feel quickly that it wasn't for me. That was a bit of a disappointment. Wonder follows a boy with a facial deformity, played by the immensely talented and mature Jacob Tremblay, who excelled in Room and even competently stood out in Book of Henry, though that wasn't his show and the movie wasn't great. He's weaker here; Wonder looks at bullying and conformity in the school system but gets bogged down in children's politics, particularly looking at the other students. Some capable writing here and there, but it gets repetitive. The girl, Via, at one point says that her little brother is the sun and other family members, including herself, are orbiting planets. A few minutes later, she says her house is the Earth and the son is the sun. Seems like we heard this metaphor before. This young actress gives a good performance in a stage play a little later, but as with many films dependent on child actors, the performances are not a strong suit. Trying to compensate, they bring in Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson as the parents, who are old enough to be Tremblay's grandparents, and look it.Other things are generic and predictable. A dog dies, the kid gets an award at the end, though it seems at first like they're going down a slightly less predictable path with the kid's friend getting the award. If you're a parent with mature kids, absolutely take them to Wonder. It will be very special to them. If not, you can probably skip it."
"I must say, I was surprised and not in a good way. This movie showcasts some really really bad parenting. Spoilers :First, keeping the little dude isolated from the start. How can you expect him to have any sense of pride in himself. Then like the father says ""throwing him into the lions nest"" is correct. I'm shocked really, where I am from the boy goes to, plays with, and interacts with his peers from the get go. This creates acceptance that we are different. And gives the boy( whom, if would have walked the streets here, you would not think twice about) confidence. There was like nothing wrong. He behaved like a kid his age, liked the stuff kids like, he would definitely get flack for being smart though. I was flabbergasted that there are people that act like this. And the parents of the one ""bad bully"" were almost better than the parents of August or ""Auggis"", almost. 
 
It's not perfect here, bullies are worldwide, but children get to mingle with all sorts of children that can function by them selves. I don't know. Left a bad taste in my mouth realising that there are people like this. Almost everything bad the boy met on the way out in the world was the parents fault. On a positive note, it had some wholesome moments and enjoyed it for what it was, but those parent and the everybody around them. Little dude was no monster. I was expecting a Joseph Merrick type deformity. Overall i was more annoyed and kinda shocked that people like this are the norm somewhere"
"I saw ""Wonder"" last night, I like Owen Wilson and I wanted to catch the film early so that I could rave about it on IMDb.com, but I cannot do that.The movie is just okay. I got the feeling that it was trying to make a significant social statement, I just wanted some fun entertainment instead. It seems like there are some movie directors in Hollywood that think they have something to ""say"" and they use their movies to get that message out....but it is just wasted energy, we don't care.Now to the review: Owen Wilson and Julia Roberts are like peanut butter and gasoline....they are completely unbelievable as husband and wife, they don't mix well. Their acting skills kept the movie going but during the movie I kept thinking there is no way these two would ever hookup in real life.And what would a new Hollywood movie be without a white chick and black guy hooking up? You guessed it, this movie does it's part at social engineering....liberal style.This movie is not fun, it is a liberal fairy tale with a liberal message.I gave the film a 4 because of the wonderful acting by ALL of the children. The kids in the film made it worth watching. Kudo's to the kids!"
"Owen Wilson is a pleasure to watch - not just because of his looks but because he's a good actor - but he was so the wrong guy for this character. He seems more like the cool uncle than the concerned dad.But the worst thing is that there is ZERO chemistry between Wilson and Roberts - and whoever cast Julia Roberts as a mother in this movie needs to be fired immediately. The woman just cannot pull this off. She looks uncomfortable in the role, like she's doing what she can to make some bucks, but also as if she's thinking, ""I'm Julia Roberts! Look at me trying to play this character!"" It's like her huge ego is visible in this movie. Maybe she's become so big that she can't even remember what humility is anymore.The actress playing Auggie's sister is adorable and does a great job, and Auggie embraces his character, too, but the family just doesn't work. The story is pretty cheesy but presents a hopeful outcome to a nasty case of bullying that in real life may have turned really, really ugly."
"The movie was perfect!
The movie was perfect!
The movie was perfect!"
"I was hoping for something a little more original than a Little House on the Prairie episode. First of all, maybe I missed something, but when the future bully Julian was taking Auggie on a school tour he may have said a few insensitive things, but only because he's a kid, not out of mean spiritedness, yet Auggie makes a know-it-all wisecrack about the mispronunciation of a word by Julian and then Julian turns against him. Can't say I blamed him.And why did his sister have only one friend? Her best friend blows her off and then she is completely a loner? She seems normal and nice enough to have other friends. Julia Robert's characterization of the mother confused me. At first I thought she was dressed liked a sister wife and had her hair in braids because she was a homeschooler. But then she became a little more hip looking as the movie progressed. Why? Because she was no longer a homeschooler, but back out in the real world? And what did Owen Wilson do for a living to be able to afford a place like that in what I assume was Manhattan (maybe Brooklyn?) and pay for private schools. We never find out but I was dying to know because he came off as a bozo. Overall, I don't think Auggie had it so bad at school. I guess that was the message. Everyone has it bad. Pretty depressing. He has one friend, and yet his ""normal"" sister only had one friend also. I don't think he didn't have a lot of friends because of how he looked. He just didn't have the kind of personality to become popular. I liked the boy in ""Mask"" because his schoolmates overlooked his deformities because he had a likeable, friendly, outgoing personality. One last oberservation as trivial as it may be. What kind of supervision did this school have? In the middle of the showing of a movie during the field trip, the two boys get up and walk out with no one noticing or saying a word. They could have run off to the lake and drowned. As a parent, I was horrified."
"WONDER is in the vein of MASK and BOY IN THE PLASTIC BUBBLE as stories of young boys growing up with the odds against them because of a physical malady. It's sweet and inspiration with another terrific performance by Jacob Trembley (ROOM) as Auggie, a child with Treacher Collins Syndrome, which despite numerous surgeries, leaves him with a face that is less than classically attractive. The cast overall is strong with Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson as Auggie's parents, and Izabela Vidovic as his sympathetic sister. Daveed Diggs and Mandy Patinkin are solid as his teacher and principal respectively. While not overly sentimental, Director and Co-Writer Stephen Chbosky and his collaborators don't always find the right note or touch with the dialogue. The script (based on R.J. Palacio's novel) feels contrived at times (and the pop culture references are sprinkled in a bit too liberally at time), but the force of the acting ensemble mostly carries it over some unsteady passages. The supporting cast is also progressively thought out which adds to the general uplifting feel of the production. WONDER is imperfect, but it's good to see a movie which can be enjoyed by the whole family. And, who doesn't a little uplift at the movies once in a while?"
"The 2017 film Wonder, based on R. J. Palacio's novel of the same name, follows the story of Auggie Pullman (Jacob Tremblay) as he enters the fifth grade. The typical worries of entering a new grade are amplified for Auggie since it is his first year not being homeschooled. The first decade of Auggie's life was filled with dozens of surgeries to address complications due to Treacher Collins syndrome.Treacher Collins syndrome is characterized by facial differences around the eyes, ears, nose, and jawbone. These differences can cause difficulty breathing, speaking, and hearing that can usually be improved through reconstructive surgeries. 1 in 50,000 people are born with Treacher Collins syndrome and 1-2 in 1,000 are born with craniofacial differences.With a fairly large population of affected actors to choose from, many in the disability community were disappointed and frustrated when the producers chose Jacob Tremblay to play the role. Since Tremblay is not affected by a facial difference, he was made to look disfigured with extensive makeup and had to fake a speech impediment. Tremblay did reach out to children with craniofacial differences in an attempt to accurately portray their experiences, but surely Auggie's experiences could have been better shown by someone who does not have the ability the wipe off their facial differences at the end of each day.Ariel Henley, a writer with facial disfigurement as a result of Crouzon Syndrome, explains that she liked the idea of seeing ""someone like"" herself ""on the big screen"". She could identify with Auggie's struggles through numerous surgeries to correct facial differences and the childhood experience of ""trying to understand why"" she ""was different and why"" she ""didn't belong."" The camaraderie that the craniofacial community could feel with Auggie ended once Tremblay was cast.The film industry has a history of casting nondisabled actors as disabled characters- Dustin Hoffman in Rainman and Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump are two critically acclaimed examples. It is surprising that this pattern persists into the 21st century: a time where 'inclusion' and 'diversity' are buzzwords that have received attention across almost every facet of society.Jay Ruderman, the president of the Ruderman Family Foundation which focuses on disability inclusion, makes the point that, ""We no longer find it acceptable for white actors to portray black characters. Disability as a costume needs to also become universally unacceptable"". Currently, disability acting has become a place for nondisabled actors to show the scope of their ability rather than a place to focus on the experiences of those in the disabled community.When a nondisabled actor plays a disabled character, the disabled experience is almost always misrepresented. This misrepresentation can cause the viewer to form stereotypes about people with disabilities and prevents nondisabled viewers from gaining an understanding of the disabled experience.Not using actors with disabilities, especially in a movie like Wonder that is aimed at children, sends the message that people with disabilities are unable to represent themselves. This message can be especially harmful to children with disabilities who, like their nondisabled peers, are still trying to figure out where they fit in the world. A lack of role models can hurt their sense of self-worth. In most cases, the only thing preventing a disabled actor from playing a disabled character is the casting director's preferences and biases.Disabled actors must be cast in order to show both nondisabled people and children with disabilities that disability does not equal incapability. Being part of the disability community should not come with shame but with pride."
"Totally lame! I dont see why others were moved by this movie, bad script, bad acting job, bad cast, the storyline has been done before. Kid has a deformity, kids make fun of said kid. Julia Roberts was too old for the part, this movie should have been quickly taken out of the theater. There wasnt any moving parts, true Auggie did leanr how to deal with students but to keep discussing the bullying and the principal didnt do much about it, lame!!! the story has already been done before it seems like another rewrite of the story Penelope with Christina Ricci."
"The movie deals with the day to day problems of a fifth grader with facial differences. It has very genuine feel and Julia Roberts makes a wonderful mother. August ""Auggie"" Pullman is just adorable. The film also takes a firm stand against bullying which brings out a very strong message for the students of the age group 10 to 16 years."
"Bad movie. Maybe it works for children but the script is very predictable and full of clichés. Unbelievable and silly twists in the plot are annoying. We've seen movies about minorities and bullying in school too often and this movie does not add anything. The underdog becomes the heroe and the proces takes steps that are really too predicatble and toothachingly sweet. At the end you realize that you have seen a boring movie that from the start tries to shove a simple message through your throat. The movie tries hard to be emotionally moving but fails painfully, except maybe when you are 12 or younger."
"Tells the story of a young boy Auggie (Tremblay) with facial differences and how he affects the people around him.Whilst this is all perhaps just a little bit too perfect, it wisely avoids gushing sentimentality and focusses as much, if not more on those around Auggie and how directly and indirectly he affects them. So whilst it steers a rather predictable course, it's message that kindness can win through makes for a pleasant heart warming story."
If you dont like this movie then I 'wonder' what else would you like !
"I'm really surprised with the negative reviews on this movie
this movie shows the real family support's role in life. It is also a must see for every family with young children,for its anti-buling example. The actors are amazing."
"When I saw this movie I was glad that the movie had a happy ending because movies where you see people who have facial differences like this like Joseph Merrick from The Elephant Man and Rocky Dennis from Mask they have sad endings but in this case with this movie it has a happy ending and I love films with happy endings and if you haven't seen it I encourage one day that this movie will be on the top on one of the AFI 100 famous movie quote in the future and I have two on what Auggie Pullman said in Wonder and that is ""Courage. Kindness. Friendship. Character. These are the qualities that define us as human beings, and propel us, on occasion, to greatness"" the other is When given the choice between being right and being kind, chose kind."
"I do not know if it is a good film. But it is an usuful one. Maybe, necessary. And this detail is the most significant. Good performances, touching and more story, precise message, a film about heroes in different perspective and the tears of the end. A film of fine equilibrium because easy could become pathetic. But the great job of each actor, the freshness of emotion and its authenticity are virtues saving each scene and imposing ppure admiration for brilliant craft of an admirable adaptation."
About kids but wonderful for all ages; well directed and scripted. Good performances by Jacob Tremblay and Julia Roberts.
"Very Touching film. I really enjoyed it.
Great Acting from all of the cast. Owen Wilson better performance from recent years. Roberts is always amazing in films. I love that dog. 7/10"
"Not perfect; not very realistic especially the ending, but so touching and heartwarming.
I enjoyed it."
Gosh the beginning just made me cry... this film is brilliant
"What a beautiful movie. I cried the whole way thru for Auggie, his parents, his sister and Even for Miranda. They were a mix of happy and sad tears. If you have a chance to please watch this movie. Everyone should."
"I remember when 'Wonder' was about to come out in theatres the trailer for it was on before every other movie I went to see, so I got to see it a lot of times. And every time it would come on it would make me very sad. I knew that the full length film was going to be a tough watch and so I put off watching it until now. Sure enough I was right. A very tough watch indeed. But also a rewarding one. It's a feel-good film, but it certainly doesn't have you feeling good from start to finish. The end product though is a very high quality one.I loved that the film specifically takes the time to explore the support characters lives and how certain things have effected them. All the focus certainly wasn't on the character of 'Auggie' as I expected it to be. This was a nice touch, that both worked to break the film up and also give it some depth allowing the audience to see things from different points of view.There are a lot of child actors in this film (who I usually struggle to watch), but they all put forward a great effort and are never distractingly bad. In fact they are surprisingly good. They were likeable (or unlikeable depending on which character you are referring to), charming and genuine. This was a massive bonus to the film.It doesn't matter who you are, school can be a tough time. To see someone clearly struggling and knowing the pain they must be going through is never going to be an easy watch. This is a tough and gritty film subject, but it's one that I'm glad I took the time to sit down and watch. I would highly recommend this film to anyone who is on the edge about watching it. Grit your teeth and hit the play button. You'll be glad you did."
