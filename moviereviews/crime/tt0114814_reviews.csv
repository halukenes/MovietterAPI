"Ah, the Usual Suspects. My personal favorite movie of all time. Don't let my bias be a fool. Perhaps it's not THE best movie ever, but it's one that I never get tired of.If you like flash and bikinis and breath-taking camera angles, you won't find them here. Usual Suspects is not an ""epic,"" and it doesn't pretend to be. It's a modestly-budgeted piece by a fresh director (who later went on to do the X-Men movies, a FAR departure).A great, gritty script, beautifully-acted characters, and what many have called the greatest movie ending of all time, are some of the shining qualities that make the Usual Suspects an object worthy of praise above its humble-looking shell.The casting is very unusual but somehow fits perfectly. Gabriel Byrne is convincing as the ex-con trying to build a new life when he gets drawn back into his old life. Stephen Baldwin has the role of his career as the smart-mouthed and cocky professional. Kevin Pollak takes a big departure from his usual good comedy self to take a more dramatic role. Benicio del Toro literally takes a one-dimensional character with absolutely nothing in the script to give him character, and he fleshes it out with brilliant mannerisms and memorable mumbling to show incredible acting creativity. Kevin Spacey as we know him was born from this movie. His manners and fast-talking yet shy gimp nature are a treat to listen to throughout the flick.Without giving away the plot, the best and most genius parts of the movie are the subtleties. After you see the ending, and the truth hits you like a ton of bricks, you have to watch it again. On the second time through, you'll jump up and point at the screen whenever you spot a clue you missed the first time. It's even possible to watch the movie multiple times and see something new with every viewing. It's that attention to detail that make the deceptively innocent-looking Usual Suspects one of the greatest movies of all time."
"DISCLAIMER: Not seen 'The Usual Suspects' yet? Then don't waste any time reading this! Rent it, buy it, borrow it, I don't mind, but watch it before you bother reading any further.One of the main reasons that 'The Usual Suspects' leaves such a long-lasting impression on the viewer is that it takes advantage of the gullibility of the audience. For the first 100 minutes we are delivered an intriguing and complex story to which there seems no easy answer. When the final piece of the puzzle seems to be in place the entire film is turned on its head. This final revelation initially leaves you speechless and then shortly after the audience realises that they have fallen for a brilliantly inspired trick. The second great trick that this film plays on its audience is making us think that by watching it again we'll be able to understand slightly better what was really going on. The truth is that the more you try to make sense of it, the more confusing it becomes. It's probably best not to try to look for any concrete answers and just accept that we fell for the filmmaker's tricks. The success of the film is mainly thanks to the sense of satisfaction the audience is left with at the end of the film. I think that people love the idea of a story when you're not sure who you can really trust, along with the realisation that the film's most shady characters are the filmmakers themselves.Aside from the twist the film is also unique in the way the narrative is presented. The majority of the story is told as a series of flashbacks by crippled con artist Verbal Kint (a performance which deservedly won Kevin Spacey his first Oscar). The film's other Oscar went to screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie (who also directed 'The Way of the Gun' (2000)) for his brilliantly constructed screenplay. It's a testament to the director, Bryan Singer that he was able to combine all these elements and turn them into something which is nothing short of a modern masterpiece. His moody and stylish direction help to bring the film together and perfectly complement the film's dark tone. A mention should also go to John Ottman for his skilful editing and amazing score.The Usual Suspects is more than just a film with a clever ending. It revealed an awful lot about film audiences and showed us that their expectations can be used against them. It is also a film about story telling and the importance of myth. I think that one of the most valuable lessons that filmmakers can learn from Â‘The Usual Suspects' is that the more interesting and intriguing your story is the more your audience will believe.The Usual Suspects was certainly not the first film to contain twist ending (the twist ending became one of Alfred Hitchcock's trademarks) and was certainly not the last ('The Sixth Sense' (1999) also used this technique effectively but left more subtle clues for the audience to pick up on their repeated viewings). Despite this 'The Usual Suspects' remains one of the most innovative and memorable crime thrillers of the nineties."
"'The Usual Suspects' has received a lot of comment for its killer twist ending, which while by no means the first in movie history, has proved to be enormously influential (stand up Messrs. Fincher and Shyamalan...). But this movie is so much more than a surprise ending! It is a meticulously scripted, faultlessly acted masterpiece that stands up to repeated viewings. Every single time I watch it I notice some new detail, or get more enjoyment out of a performance or scene. This movie really put  Kevin Spacey on the map, but everyone in the ensemble cast is outstanding, even Stephen Baldwin(!), who has never appeared in a movie this good before, or since.  I also got a kick out of the Paul Bartel ( 'Death Race 2000', 'Eating Raoul') cameo, and the ultra-cool Peter Greene's ('Laws Of Gravity', 'Pulp Fiction') all too brief appearance. Bartel is sorely missed, and Greene one day (mark my words!) will become the star he deserves to be.Director Bryan Singer has yet to live up to the promise shown here with his subsequent movies, the average 'Apt Pupil' and the disappointing 'X-Men'. For all the acclaim he and the (admittedly superb) cast have received, the real star of 'The Usual Suspects' is Christopher McQuarrie's sensational script, one of the finest of the modern era, and one that genuinely deserved it's Oscar.It really doesn't get any better than this!! One of the greatest movies ever made, any time, any where. A truly unforgettable experience."
"One day in a bookshop, I flipped through a book entitled: ""the movies of the nineties"" and this movie wasn't included! How can a book specialized in cinema skip such a milestone of the last decade? Any movie buff, any cinema critic must have considered the nineties a fruitful era for the American thriller. According to one's tastes, some will say that the best thriller of the nineties is ""Silence of the Lambs"" (1991). For others it will be ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) while others will praise to the skies ""Se7en"" (1995). For me, the pinnacle is this present movie, ""the Usual Suspects"" (1995) with its staggering story (to put it mildly). It's a sensational debut for Bryan Singer which enabled to put him on the map. With a little help from his accomplice Christopher McQuarrie, he signed an unparalleled gem in the landscape of the American thriller, even the whole cinema.The average viewer who watches ""the Usual Suspects"" for the first time might think that the whole crew concocted him a meandering story with as a leading thread, Spacey's convoluted story. At the end of the projection, he may feel puzzled and will probably wish to watch the movie a second time. He won't regret it and Singer and McQuarrie will rejoice at it. Their masterwork gains by several repeated viewings to appreciate the subtleties of a rich movie with a convoluted construction which will take its seemingly definitive form in the five last minutes. To watch ""the Usual Suspects"" is like gathering the pieces of an intriguing puzzle, a little like any other suspenseful movie but in the case of Singer's flick, one will never really be able to completely end it. So many things happen in less than two hours that we are never really sure of what we watch and this is reinforced by a breathtaking unexpected twist at the end which makes our assumptions falter. Singer and McQuarrie take a mischievous delight in taking the viewer in their nebulous scenario and to follow it according to Spacey's declarations and it's obvious that they raise more questions than answers. It's up to the viewer to make his imagination work and to bring his thoughts on the film. This is what inspires its pernicious charm.From Spacey's story, the authors developed a top quality script, set with clockwork precision. Singer's directorial style virtually evolutes on the razor's edge and conveys an increasing tension. It is filled with ingenious visual ideas and served by fluid camera movements. Singer was in his early thirties when he shot his film but it presents the signs of a seasoned author. There's also a tight editing and a unsettling score which cement the movie in its place of winner. More remarkable, the authors pull off with gusto to increase the audience's curiosity throughout the film in spite of a somewhat deliberate confusion and the interest won't weaken until the end which constitute the apex: an unexpected twist which will leave the audience speechless once they understood it. In Singer's flick, it doesn't disappoint because there are little but noticeable visual and verbal clues which justify it. However, it has something unsettling. We believe that we are at the end of the maze but there's more to the picture than meets the eye. Maybe this ""coup de theatre"" veils one more truth. Maybe also the shrewdest ones will have guessed it but the result is the same for any viewer: Singer puts a baffled spectator in his pocket.Singer and Quarrie show a perfect master in the domain of the film noir: an ominous atmosphere, nocturnal scenes which stay rooted in the mind and a deep psychology of certain characters which give more substance to the film. Considering the last point, the character of Gabriel Byrne is the most interesting one: a former crooked cop who seemingly redeemed himself in catering but caught up by his past and forced to come back to work. I personally think that Byrne is the stand-out of the topflight cast the movie boasts. But don't neglect the other members. Kevin Spacey pocketed a deservedly Oscar in 1996 and the rest of the cast doesn't stay on the bench. Maybe Singer grants a little shallow attention to the three others baddies in the gang but in a way it's necessary to underscore the fact that they're lousy gangsters embroiled in a infernal spiral and unable to perceive what lies beneath all this. Pete Postlewhaite and Chazz Palminteri make their scenes count too.A riveting storytelling, a painstaking flash-back, a tight and first-class directing, a thoughtful twist, a topnotch cast, ""the Usual Suspects"" includes almost everything a director would sell his soul for. Everything contributes to make it a stalwart model in the suspenseful movie and the whole cinema. After the first vision, be prepared for mental gymnastics and for a second screening..."
"The Usual Suspects is two movies in one.  Enjoyable the first time you watch it, even more enjoyable the second time round.  The first viewing asks questions that are answered in an `I could kick myself' moment in the final few minutes, and the second viewing is interesting because when you know the answers, the film becomes that much clearer.  It requires a certain amount of commitment, though.  Be warned, if you stop concentrating for a moment then the remaining running time of the movie will be spent trying to figure out how what you missed has lead to what you are now watching.It concerns the story of five felons brought in by the police for a line-up and how those same felons reluctantly end up working for the mysterious and ghost-like Keyser Soze: a legend among the criminal fraternity, a man who no-one has seen and lived, a man so dangerous that he is thought to be the devil himself.you get the idea.  The plot is rather intricate so I shan't bother to explain it here but it does rather make me think that Christopher McQuarrie, the writer, kept going to the office in the morning with yet another complexity to add that he thought up the night before.  That's not to say it doesn't work, far from it, but it does leave you reeling from the sheer amount of information and names thrown at you from the offset.Gabriel Byrne is good, but not flawless, as the tortured Dean Keaton who is torn between his career as a criminal and his forlorn attempt at trying to go straight, but his relationship with uptown lawyer Edie Finneran (Suzy Amis) is badly explored and I never felt it gave motive enough for his actions throughout the movie.  Kevin Spacey is wonderful as the crippled Roger 'Verbal' Kint and is effective with the results both cunning and tragic.  The real star of the movie, however, is a strangely accented Pete Postlethwaite as Kobayashi, supposedly Keyser Soze's right-hand man.  He effortlessly plays a character of terrible coolness and poker-faced efficiency leading the dance that the rest of the characters must follow.Director Bryan Singer has done well to bring such a momentous and involved screenplay to life and any gripes I may have cannot detract from the fact that the film, as a whole, is much better than the sum of its parts."
"I don't know what the problem is. I had heard that this is an incomprehensible film. That when it ends we don't know what exactly happened. I thought that throughout the film we were in the loop, and even if we have an unreliable narrator, I suspected that from the start. Anyway, it's been a long time since I've been taken for such a joyride with such interesting characters, even if they are murderers and felons. The plot is woven so delicately and the threat is so interesting, that I was involved from the first minute. I always wondered how Kevin Spacey, a rather ordinary looking guy with a receding hairline, got to be so well known. Obviously, this is the reason. His performance is right on and he dominates the screen, even though he is a ""gimp."" There are so many layers in this film, but I don't think the screenwriter ever plays unfairly with it and it is quite satisfying."
"Such films like this should be enshrined in museums, simply due to the fact it destroyed the entire genre of mystery films. While this film was unique and captivating, no other mystery will ever accomplish this sort of cult status, single handedly shaping a genre. While most mysteries try to shock you too often with twists and even more twists, it turns out to be overkill. This film encompassed such ideas with flair and originality, which is probably the reason Brian Singer is sticking to sci-fi action films. Only Memento and The Game are the only recent mystery movies worthy enough to stand beside this film. Sadly, Singer has somewhat sold out by doing the X-Men movies, but I guess trying to make films like this would be too taxing. This film will always bring a smile to my face when I watch it with someone who hasn't seen this movie. A good viewing every time I watch it, the new special edition DVD is awesome."
"Out of the mind of Christorpher McQurrie comes this incredible story of a man in search of the devil. The film is called "" The Usual Suspects"" and what could be more appropriate than an unusual movie about five suspects who are anything but usual. The story originates with the only survivor of what the police conclude was a murderous and explosive drug deal gone bad. His name is Roger Kint (Kevin Spacey is perfect) also known as 'Verbal.' From the mouth of this innocent storytelling, con-artist comes the fantastic tale of how he and his fellow criminals, Stephen Baldwin, is Michael McManus, Benicio Del Toro is Fred Fenster and Kevin Pollak as Todd Hockney were originally assembled and then set-up. Beginning with a mix-up by law enforcement to put several guilty men together in the same line up, the tale proceeds cross country and culminates with a powerful, but mysterious kingpin by the name of Keyser Soze. It's through his attorney, Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite), the men learn they are marked for death unless they undertake a dangerous assignment. The center piece of the Unusual group is their leader, a remarkable individual named Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne, incredible performance). What transpires in this movie from moment to moment is a lesson in sleigh of hand. What we and the police Dave Kujan, (Chazz Palminteri) are told is not what we see. Conversely, what we see is not what we have been told. In the end, this film with it's haunting theme by John Ottman, is nothing short of incredible. A superb classic in both mystery and action entertainment, by Bryan Singer. A great film indeed. ****"
"""The Usual Suspects"" is a complicated puzzle of a movie that I bet you can't watch just once.  The film deals with five career crooks who have big plans after they are all brought together in a police lineup.  However, their mayhem is interrupted by a mysterious character named Kaiser Sose who plans to eliminate all five of the crooks after they all crossed him in various ways during their checkered pasts.  An amazing original screenplay and tight direction keep up a substantial amount of tension throughout.  Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Benicio Del Toro, Kevin Pollak, Pete Postlethwaite, and Chazz Palminteri all give top-notch performances.  But it is Kevin Spacey (in an Oscar-winning part) that makes ""The Usual Suspects"" work on all levels.  This part put him in a higher class of actors and can be compared to Robert DeNiro's star-making job in ""The Godfather, Part II"".  5 stars out of 5."
"If plagiarism were a crime in film techniques, director Bryan Singer would be imprisoned for life. Screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie would be serving a similar sentence. However, since it is not, Singer and MacQuarrie (who have joined forces again after the not-so-successful PUBLIC ACCESS) took advantage and duplicated nothing but the best. From CASABLANCA to PULP FICTION, and even a version of a line (intentionally or otherwise) from BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID.Many people oppose watching a film with a twist a second time. I disagree. By watching it again you can observe how the director and the screenwriter have hidden and revealed clues, how they have tried to steer the audience away from the ending. First time is for entertainment. Second time is for art. This film is certainly worthwhile to see again. To date, I have watched it five times. (Two of those five times I thought, 'well, I'll just watch about half-an-hour,' but ended up watching the entire film because it is so entertaining.) I'm not exactly a noir fan, so it is assured that this particular crime film appeals to a wider audience.THE USUAL SUSPECTS has a skilled director, an engrossing screenplay, and ten praiseworthy performances. The film runs a fast 105 minutes. Don't miss a minute of it."
"Although the film is perhaps a little slow in fully developing, the consequent results are astounding. Spacey's performance is captivating and will only be fully appreciated once the viewing is complete. The supporting cast, including Gabriel Byrne, provide the basis for a convincing drama which will change the way you perceive crime thrillers in the future.One is required to discover the identity of the elusive Keyser Soze throughout the film and if it were not for the well thought-out script and professional dramatic acting then the viewer would feel a sense of anti-climax. However, this is not the case; you shall be left speechless and wondering how the film achieved its goal."
"I have seen this movie many times and yet it still astonishes me every time I watch it.  Even though I know the ending I still feel myself being caught up in the plot.  It is possibly one of the greatest scripts of all time.  I can't remember another movie in which I was completely astonished at the finale.  The cast gives a tremendous performance.  Kevin Spacey gives one of his two best performances (the other being as John Doe in Se7en) in my opinion.  That is probably why he was awarded Best Actor for this role.  It was truly deserved.  Gabriel Byrne also gives a great performance.  It may be the best character Stephen Baldwin has ever played.  In all, this is a must for any movie collector or enthusiast."
"Kaiser Soze is a super-criminal of almost comic-book stature. Legendary among an underground of testosterone and nicotine-driven low-life 'usual suspects' of this film - Soze - remains unseen, fantastic, just outside of the camera's view, and detached from any reality we might call familiar or real. Nevertheless, he is the central character in the film, and the single force of will driving the entire film. The viewer, like the characters portrayed, must constantly ask 'Who is Kaiser Soze, does he even exist?"", and - as silly as it might seem - ""is he the devil himself?"". Soze's irresistible will is represented and enforced by an emissary (the stone-faced Pete Postlethwaite) who is just as cold-hearted as any of the hardened criminals who comprise 'The Usual Suspects'.The narrative begins and almost ends as a retrospective with just a bit of very necessary voice-over narrative by Spacey. His character - Verbal Kint - is interrogated by Palmintieri concerning the murder of several hardened criminals in a single night aboard Russian ship. Most of the major plot points are highlighted wonderfully by the changes of pace and camera work afforded by the shift between one plot - the events leading to Kint's interrogation - and another - the interrogation itself.Kint, physically disabled and emotionally disturbed, is himself a desperate, down-on-his luck, petty criminal whose chief talent seems to be getting mixed up with and attaching himself to more talented criminals. His latest 'friend' - Keating (Byrne) is a brilliant but depressive thief who is trying to straighten his life out for a woman lawyer he has fallen for. But along with the other 'usual suspects' - expert safe crackers, con men and sociopaths (possibly the best performance of Stephen Baldwin's career thus far) all - Keating is swept up into agreeing to do 'one final job'. In a fine piece of character interpetation, Byrne plays denial to the hilt telling himself that this job, if successful, could end his life in crime permanently. These expert thieves, con men and killers meet in a bogus police line-up one night and from that point on, they are bound together under the control of Soze until they either succeed or fail in the crime he has laid before them.Soze has been betrayed, whether directly or indirectly, by each of these men, and he leaves them all no choice. Accept the crime plan or die. They accept, knowing that their odds of success are, to say the least, very limited.The entire feeling of this film shifts radically from the action of the main plot (described in Kint's narrative) and the narrative itself (Kint's interrogation). While this may look simply like a clever piece of film work, it is actually a very brilliant plot device, as both story lines are finally united in the stunning and brilliant finish.While I am not usually a ready fan of mysteries, and even less interested in thrillers, this film was pure entertainment from start to finish.Director Singer has established himself as a pioneer in ensemble cast direction, and this film alone (his third) should have awarded him that title.The performances are, without exception, flawless. While flawlessness or some approximation of it is something I generally expect from people like Spacey, Byrne, and Del Toro, many of the folks in this film very much surprised me. I now watch out for folks like Kevin Pollak, for example. Without detracting from the performers whatsoever, some credit for the stunning quality of the performances must go to the director, editor, script and cinematography team. This film makes them all look positively great.I was bitterly disappointed by the fact that this film did not take many Academy Awards in its release year. While I realize that the academy's choices do not always reflect quality or achievement, I prefer to maintain at least a superficial guise of hopefulness. The fact that Usual Suspects did not win for editing was the biggest shock. I can not think of a better piece of editing."
"Usual Suspects is one of the Best Mystery Thrillers in the world. It contains one of the greatest endings ever seen in any film. When i first saw this film, i understood 85% of the film. I had to watch it again, to recap on what happened earlier. After the second time i watched it, i realised this is a Superb movie with a fabulous twist. I have now seen this film about 20 times and seems to get better every time i watch it. Kevin Spacey delivers the greatest performance in his career. Gabriel is great, Benecio delivers a great performance with humour. Stephen is quite good in his best film. Pollak was impressive, Chazz Palminteri is a Superb underrated actor. Chazz looks ultimately smart and supposingly is a intelligent investigator. But Spacey turns out to be 10 steps ahead. Superb, brilliant and any other great ways to describe this film."
"Boasting petty criminal characters conceived so brilliantly they achieve near-mythological status, The Usual Suspects is known for riveting suspense and action, an intriguing plot line and a jaw- dropping twist at the end. It also features some of the most memorable lines of the 1990s: ""How do you shoot the devil in the back--what if you miss?"" The characters, Roger ""Verbal"" Kint (Kevin Spacey), Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak), Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) and Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) have real character details and cues.The film is set in the aftermath of a ship fire that totally burns the cargo and crew. Though meek and disabled, Verbal is the only survivor to walk away from the incident unscathed. He is taken into custody and grilled by the police. Brilliantly played in a characteristic, understated style that earned Spacey an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, Verbal is cleared and allowed to leave. But before he can go, agent Kujan from US Customs shows up to interrogate him. Kujan is trying to build a case against Keaton and he wants Verbal to testify in exchange for immunity. Verbal refuses, but Kujan still bullies Verbal into recounting his story of Keaton, McManus, Fenster and Hockney, leading up to the explosion on the ship. What follows is a fantastic yarn of lies and half-truths sprinkled within the facts of the case. It is all masterfully portrayed as a series of flashbacks while Verbal and Kujan sip coffee and talk in the LA police station. The story begins six weeks earlier in New York City as Verbal and the other four criminals are brought in to stand side-by-side in a police lineup. None of them are formally charged with a crime, and there are indications Keaton has actually gone straight prior to the roundup. But before they are released, the five hatch a plan to get revenge on the corrupt NYPD and make a large sum of money in the process by robbing a police-protected jewel smuggler and leaking news of the police involvement to the press. Keaton is reluctant and must be coaxed into it with the promise that no one will be killed in the heist. He agrees and the quintet pulls off the robbery to perfection. The acting and writing take chances that pay off, with each actor fully immersing himself in his role. Del Toro creates a uniquely colorful persona in his portrayal of Fenster, Baldwin conveys a reckless abandon and lust for violence, Pollak shows steely courage and resolve, Byrne is a complex mesh of toughness with motives pulling him in all directions. Each actor is at the top of his game. The five criminals go to Los Angeles to lay low in the aftermath of the New York heist. There, they are enticed into another robbery that is also supposed to involve no killing. Unfortunately, this LA heist goes horribly wrong. As Verbal recounts this carnage, its aftermath and the growing problems and hostility in the crew, agent Kujan receives a tip from one of his colleagues who has a survivor pulled from the water near the charred wreckage of the ship. The witness is badly burned and cannot speak English, but insists that the man responsible for the destruction of life and property on the ship is named Kaiser Soze. Whether it is attributable to lies in Verbal's yarn or odd casting decisions, several characters in The Usual Suspects add to the film's mystique. Chief among these is the Irish Postlethwaite cast as the Japanese Kobayashi. There is a strong clue at the end that the name Kobayashi is used solely to mislead Kujan. But Kobayashi is not the only instance of a character's name failing to match his appearance. Another example is McManus' contact in LA, Redfoot, which one would expect to be the name of a Native American. But Redfoot appears to be caucasian. Again, at the end there is an indication that Verbal used Redfoot to avoid giving Kujan a real name. Strange ethnic inconsistencies crop up constantly. Kaiser Soze is said to be Turkish, possibly with a German father. These mixed-up character portraits add a layer of complexity to the plot, but one must always consider the source, Verbal Kint, and his motives. The dynamic between Kujan and Verbal itself is pure entertainment. A kind of cat-and-mouse game, nuances are thrown into the proceedings that make it more interesting and add depth to the characters. Even the way the interrogation is filmed is unique. Verbal didn't achieve his nickname for no reason. He knows how to run his mouth and Kujan has a difficult challenge in corralling him. Underlying the interrogation is Kujan's suspicion of Keaton and his belief that Keaton manipulated Verbal. But Verbal is hard to pin down and Kujan occasionally resorts to bully tactics. But who is Kaiser Soze? Did he orchestrate the police lineup in New York, and pull all the strings ever since? Is the cargo of the ship drugs or only human cargo? Why did Verbal survive unharmed while so many others did not? Did Keaton really die, as Verbal insists, or did he slip away, as Kujan believes? Is Verbal telling the truth? Much is revealed in the final moments of the film, which wash over the viewer like an enormous wave of recognition. Snippets of dialogue from earlier in the film are montaged over the complex score, providing spine-tingling clues about exactly what part of Verbal's yarn was fact and what was fiction. The final snippet of dialogue, followed by a fortissimo string finale is especially powerful: ""and like that...he was gone."""
"The Usual Suspects, is, in my mind, one of the most fantastic pieces of film-making ever to grace our screens. That a group of people can come up with a piece of fiction that is so excellent in every way, from start to finish, is frightening. Who knows, maybe this film has no superior.A lot is made of the film's ending. Not for a moment am I going to let slip what exactly that is. I would never deny another film lover the sheer sense of amazement that ran through my body when the film reached its climax. While not the film's only strong point; this is a masterpiece ALL the way through, the ending will blow you away.The cast is, in a word, flawless. Kevin Spacey has, as far as I am concerned, never been better. He turns in a performance that is so moving and outstanding that he should have got three Oscars. But he is not alone. Byrne is fantastic, Del Toro adds continental flair, and Postlethwaite is disturbingly dark, yet calculated.By all means watch this film, and observe its strong points, from Bryan Singer's masterful direction to the equally pleasing musical score. Prepare yourself for a rollercoaster ride and the best ending EVER in a film made anywhere in the world. I mean that.Oh, and when you have finished; by all means, watch it again!9.7/10Nothing in life is 100% perfect now is it?"
"This film is basically a dark, sophisticated 'caper' thriller with the added twist that the main characters are rapidly awakened to the fact that they are being ruthlessly manipulated behind the scenes.  The deeper they go, the more intense the experience.  While none of these guys are admirable (in fact they are all clearly trash), you can't help but feel for them.  They are just so in over their heads.  And the puppeteer bad guy is a nightmare.Unfortunately I guessed its 'big secret' almost as soon as I knew there was one, and am justly disappointed.  It was nice to keep getting confirmation as it went along, but I would like to have experienced the final surprise. (And I am *sure* I'm not singular in guessing the ending.)This film really relies too much on the 'wow effect' to make its major impression (read other comments for confirmation)--always a clue that a work of art is leaning *hard* on a crutch. Take away the surprise ending, and what do you have?  In this case a stylish and well-produced film with a gaping hole. For example, compare it to LA Confidential. Even if you had guessed LAs secret before they let it out, it wouldn't spoil a thing--because that film didn't rely on a plot twist for its primary punch. It had a whole basket full of assets.I'd give this movie a 7 if its secret had been better (and more creatively) guarded.  As it stands, I give it a 6 for the excellence of the entire production and that fact that I was fairly well entertained.  But I won't be watching it again, whereas LA Confidential will always be on my list.********ABSOLUTE SPOILER *************** Agatha Christie first introduced this gimmick in 1926 with The Murder of Roger Ackroyd.   Beyond that, the whole gig follows the classic mystery formula right down the line:  Once we realize it's a whodunit (its clearly gotta be somebody we met, otherwise no punch), the obvious choice is the 'least likely one.'  And there he is, perfectly disguised to fool you into not even looking his way--a good indication you should look his way. Another giveaway is that we have one guy telling the story and everything we see is from his eyes.  Makes you wonder:  1) Why did only this guy survive? 2) Who says we are seeing the truth, except him? And the big one:  3) I'm supposed to believe a *con* artist?  Not."
"After a gun fight on the docks leaves only one survivor with the majority dead, NYC agent Dave Kujan flies in to ensure that ex-cop Dean Keaton is really dead.  During the questioning the survivor, Verbal Kint, tells of how events came to happen.  Five criminals are brought together in a line up and decide to use the events to plan a job.  However another survivor tells an extra story Â– one involving master criminal Kyser Soze.  Kint reveals how the gang were forced into the fateful job by Soze Â– however who is Soze and why did the men try to steal what appears to be a ship load of drugs that didn't exist?When I first saw this I saw it in the cinema Â– the very next day I went back and watched it again.  The plot starts with a cliff hanger and appears to gradually answer the mystery  - however what it actually does is create more questions for every answer it appears to give.  It does this without frustrating you or without confusing the issue Â– in fact you don't know right till the end that you've been caught in a story teller's web.  The plot unfolds like a normal thriller but it is anything but.The strength of the film is in the writing but it is the direction that also manages to create a great mood.  Singer uses clever shots weaving the story into a believable web of deceit.  The cast add quality to every single line, every single scene.  It's hard to imagine that the film could be the same with any one person changed.Bryne is great as Keaton, his world weary cop drawn into a plan he can't control Â– or is he the master behind it all.  Spacey gives a great performance as our eyes and ears as he retells the events, he deservedly won an Oscar for this role Â– before he got all soft and started becoming a starring man.  Baldwin has the film of his life (albeit not hard!), he's really good and should be lucky to get another good role.  Even the minor roles in the gang are great Â– Del Toro's performance is even better when you knew why he did it that way.  Likewise Pollack will never have a better role Â– he has genuine tension between him and Baldwin (even in later interviews the dislike still seems real Â– with things like Pollack telling Baldwin he's sorry that his brothers stole all the food from his table).  Palminteri does a great performance and is totally convincing.  Postlethwaite is good despite playing an Asian (?) lawyer.  Suzi Amis is good in her brief role and Esposito is as good as he always is.Overall I could talk for hours about this film.  It's rare for films now to have decent plots worth talking about however this manages it Â– it's still twisty and impressive no matter how many times you watch it."
"[**Major spoilers**] This movie began on a sour note in the opening scene with a man on an upper floor pissing down onto a ribbon of flaming gasoline on a lower floor to put it out. Right off we know that there is going to have to be some major suspension of disbelief. The story line is not nearly as complicated as it is made out to be. Within the context of this movie, maybe that was a goal. I never did figure out what the deal was with the image of the rope heading into a rat's nest of junk that was shown several times.A real problem for me was that the two main thugs in this were not at all threatening. The final plot twist only furthered this dissonance - it was kind of like finding out that behind the mask of Darth Vader we find Pee-wee Herman. And I felt manipulated by the final twist (that was in fact somewhat anticipated, after all Verbal was smoking his cigarette in the Turkish style). Are we to believe that Verbal boarded the boat and changed into a fedora and black overcoat to perform the crucial murder? What was the point of that besides trying to fool the audience? And so many times in the exchanges between Verbal and Kujan, I felt I was watching actors rather than characters.The bottom line on this movie is that it is no more than a tricked out episode of ""Law and Order"" without offering anything substantial to think about after it's over."
"I love movies with big twist ending. I love movies that play with your mind and leave you completely confused until the very end where everything finally makes sense.So I should like 'The Usual Suspects', right? Let's see: Confusing plot? Check. Big twist? Check. Point of the whole movie? NONE.This movie attempts to be clever by blatantly treating you, the audience, as an idiot. I pushed through this boring, big mess of a movie expecting a huge final revelation that would put all the puzzles pieces together. In the end, the movie throws all the puzzle pieces into the fire and laughs at you.*****SPOILERS***** (but really, don't bother watching, just read)What makes a good mystery thriller movie? CLUES! You are supposed to leave clues for the audiences to pick up so that when they watch the movie for a second time, they can bang their heads and say ""Why didn't I notice that the first time?"" In this movie, there is NO CLUE at all. Keyser Soze could have been ANYONE of the characters. The audience could never really know who is Keyser because the whole time we are forced to watch the movie from Verbal's own flawed and purposely misguided perspective! The 'twist' is one big joke. So Verbal is lying all the time? That's a twist? You dare to call that a twist? How brilliant! I could have never see that coming!! No, really. You could have never see it coming because there is literally NO WAY for you to see it coming; nothing is revealed until the movie almost ended. The only way you could have guessed is because, you know, ""the weakest, least suspicious man is probably the killer!"" What a clichÃ©. The ending basically makes the rest of the movie completely pointless, and gives no reason for me to re-watch the movie again, because it would be like listening to a liar tell a story all over again.The plot is another one big problem. The entire first hour of the movie could have been scrapped off and still makes the movie a coherent story. All the useless, boring dialogues, all the random robberies and gun shooting, did absolutely NOTHING to advance the main story or develop any of the character. Nothing relevant actually happens until the part where Kobayashi popped up and revealed the main plot about Keyser Soze and the boat hijacking. So, bad twist ending aside, the plot doesn't do the movie any justice either.The acting? Nothing amazing. What Verbal does in nearly the whole movie is limp and talk, talk, talk while giving a straight and near- emotionless face. Casting any middle-aged balding actor as Verbal would have achieved the same effect. I can't say Spacey is a bad actor because I don't think he is, but his performance as Verbal is certainly not Oscar-worthy. *****END SPOILER*****I understand that movie ratings are subjected to personal tastes and perceptions. I can understand why so many people like movies such as 'The Dark Knight' or 'Reservoir Dogs' even though I find them highly overrated. But I simply cannot accept that a movie like 'The Usual Suspects' is hailed as ""the greatest twist movie ever"" even after 20 years, when there are so many better ones like 'The Sixth Sense', 'Memento', 'Fight Club', or the highly underrated 'Identity'.Spend your two hours wisely. On anything. Just not on this movie."
"I couldn't help but set rather high expectations for 'The Usual Suspects' as I went into watching this. I knew this was no action movie or any of the crap we get nowadays. This was true cinema! I was excited 'The Usual Suspects' is a mystery film about what cargo was on board the ship when it was destroyed and the events leading up to it as we are told from the only known survivor of that accident.Around 45-50 minutes into the movie, I was starting to find myself a bit tired and thought the movie may perhaps have dragged along just a bit. I was becoming rather disappointed. Then the film truly began to change in such a way that I find it rather hard to explain. The characters began to get a little more entertaining, the pacing certainly began to pick up, the dialogue was getting more interesting and overall, I was more excited.Then comes the amazing final twenty minutes with the plot twist and the story finally closing in perfectly, making the story more understandable. However, the final 5 minutes of the movie are some of the best moments of movie ever made and that is the ultimate plot twist which surprised the hell out of me! It was a cheering end to what ended as a great movie and a movie I would be more than happy to check out again and again! A-"
"(major spoilers - plus, if you're a fan of the film, you won't like my review)I've never understood the fuss made over this movie - every time its been on TV i've watched the first five minutes, and rolled my eyes for various reasons (the first time it was Gabriel Byrne's accent, the other times it was how over-wrought everything was) and put something good on instead.I've finally given it the light of day tonight, to the end, and my feeling is this: one minute of cleverness at the end does not justify putting us through two hours of over-wrought actors playing at cops and robbers.The general situation is so very familiar - the crims who get together for one last job that goes wrong, and the way its told is not fresh either: the structure of the framing narrative in the present day and the flashbacks which take us back to a past event we want to learn the truth about, comes from Citizen Kane and Rashomon (ie, on its own does not make this movie original). The constant promise of a final mystery, which is intended to propel us to the end was invented by Orson Welles, and is a device used quite frequently (Citizen Kane, Rashomon, Go, Memento, The Exterminating Angel, and most movies, in fact).For two hours this is a lot of posing, actors dressed in ""slumming-it"" costumes straight from the costume designer's wardrobe, cliche dialogue, unbelievable situations, one unsustainable haircut, stubble and a lot of brooding ""i'm a criminal"" close-ups.There is a justified reason for all this falseness (aka pretentiousness), given in the final two minutes, which i can't even bring myself to say in case you haven't seen it and are still reading - i've had too many movies ruined for me. Save to say, like The Sixth Sense, this movie is a one-gimmick movie, and it takes watching it for two hours to find out that gimmick (which is the only possible explanation for characters having what i like to call Stephen King names, by which i mean they sound like someone has sat down and thought ""What's a really cool name i can make up?"" instead of names real people would have. Or possibly ""what's the wackiest name i can give a person and have the audience not laugh"" - if this was the case, they failed with me. Every time someone said ""Verbal Kint,"" ""Kobayashi,"" or ""Kaiser Sosay"" i couldn't help giggling) - i spent two hours rolling my eyes and two minutes saying ""yes, that's clever, but if people didn't equate twists with quality then i could have enjoyed the entire two hours - but it would not have been this movie, which is nothing without its gimmick. I had the same problem with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind - i need more than one gimmick to keep me interested."
"I gave this movie a 1. Ignore the plot, there is none. The only spoiler is: The whole move is the invention of Verbal/Keyser who is trying to confuse the cop he is telling the story to...and us the audience. It appears that the movie was intended to have a twist ending, but at about 1/3rd of the way through the movie the director gave up trying to be coherent and just went with confusing. The ending that 'ties it all together' is that...well, none of it was true.Anyway, if you think that finding out at the end of the movie that pretty much everything you were shown was a lie makes for a good twist, you may like this movie. You will not understand it, because there is nothing to understand. At the end, all of the plot points were a made-up story, so what was the point? It is like watching 90 minutes of one movie and then watching the last 10 minutes of another movie. In short, this is really a waste of time."
"This review contains mild spoilers so don't read it if you haven't seen the flick.I hate these movies that just go and tack on this ending that no one could have predicted and it's supposed to be witty.  It's stuff like Urban Legends and Scream where the killer is the last person you'd suspect because the reason behind it is retarded and mostly based on information that you don't have.  Worse than that is stuff like Clue where there are a bunch of possible different endings to the movie that all work so that there's really no way to predict the ending.This movie was even more idiotic than those because not only is there no certain way to come to the logical conclusion given the clues but the whole story we're presented with is a string of lies.  Oh wow shocker!  Well of course it's a shocker!  It's like you hear the story of little red riding hood and then at the end your grandmother who's telling it to you says ""You know what?  I was that little girl and there was no wolf after all.  I drugged my granny and stole all her cash then blamed it on the wolf."" Holy crap!  I could never have predicted that!So this movie is worse than the farces that are Urban Legends, Scream, Clue and a majority of all the other movies that have ever been made.How this guy also did the brilliant movie that is X-Men is a mystery to me.1/10 and that's only because the scale doesn't have a zero"
"I wanted to like this movie but...**SPOILER**The movie lies to you.  In %99.99 percent of all movies, what you see on the screen is supposed to be what happened to the characters.  The only difference are things like point of view or missing details, for example you might know what happened from 3:00 to 4:00 and from 5:00 to 6:00 but not from 4:00 to 5:00.  Or you might know that Mr. A was there killing Mr.B but it's not until later you find that Mr.C was also there.In this movie though, several of the scenes are deliberate lies.  That breaks one of the cardinal rules of movie making.  Not that there are any rules but if the camera lies then there's basically no point in watching.It would have been a good movie for me, even with the twist, if all the scenes had been about reality and the twist brought all your missing knowledge together.  Instead, the twist just invalidated everything before it.  You end up not knowing if any scene in the entire movie has anything to do with reality whatsoever.Given that I honestly don't understand why people like this movie.  Try Memento, it doesn't lie.  Try Fight Club,  Try 6th Sense.  All much better movies because they are not full of camera lies.**END SPOILER**"
"I was deeply disappointed by this movie. The alleged and hyped twist ending could not have been more predictable. As soon as the mystery character was introduced, I suspected who it would be. As the story unfolded, it was clearer and clearer that it could be only one person. In a bit of Sherlock Holmes logic, all the other options were eliminated and the final remaining choice had to be the correct choice.We know from early on that the narrating character survives the opening sequence unscathed. That alone was a huge signal which spoils any chance of a surprise. The narrating character is revealed to be an excellent story teller, to be manipulative, cunning, and incapable of being truly frightened. Those are exactly the characteristics of the mystery character. Again, this made the ending obvious.That the story is filled with 90% false information is disappointing. It's a fundamental violation of the compact between the storyteller and the audience. Perhaps if the twist were not so clearly communicated from the beginning, perhaps if there really was some thought required in getting to the ending, then perhaps it might have some shred of justification. Only perhaps, though -- In the end, almost certainly not."
"*** CONTAINS SPOILERS ***Many movies have twists in their plot. Some of these movies leave you bewildered, the others just leave a bitter taste in your mouth.80% of this movie is based on Kint's narrative, and because of that, the narrative BECOMES the whole movie experience. I do not think it is clever or fair to end the movie by saying, ""haha, just kidding. the whole movie is just a lie.""Some people think that Kint's narrative was true, he just obfuscated the names. IMHO, I don't think that would redeem the movie. If it's a good mind-twister, which it's supposed to be, the audience would say, ""so he is Kaiser Soze, yes, thinking back, it was obvious."" But no, any of those five suspects could have been Kaiser Soze, the hints were not obvious nor subtle. I felt that the screen wright randomly chose one of the suspects to be Kaiser Soze at the end.Don't take me wrong, I think both the direction and acting are decent in this movie, but I cannot agree that the plot is anything special. In fact, except the big twist in the end, there is nothing exciting about it. To exaggerate it a little, the plot can be described as a glorified version of ""Scream."""
"I really cannot believe that this movie has its fair share of bad reviews and people who do not know what actually happened and what parts were true and what parts were lies.The truth, Verbal did recruit the others for the hit on the boat, he did manipulate, trap, and deceive them into thinking they were going to hit a big drug deal. What he lied about was the names of people and motives. During his interrogation he tried to tell as little as possible and make himself out to be just a pawn in the game. But Dave Kuyan was figuring things out, and as such Verbal would have to reveal more or feign ignorance. Eg, Verbal said it was about drugs, Kuyan figured out it was to hit an informant. So all the actions from the lineup to the boat were real, and the fact that the lawyer picks Verbal/Souze up at the end shows this.As for the twist, its a good twist, and not one that just comes out of the Blue. There are many hints throughout the movie that Verbal is more than he seems, but these are only apparent second time round. Hints include, The way Verbal shot the guy in the car despite supposedly being disabled and not being able to flick a lighter properly. The absolute first scene that shows Keaton about to die, that shows that Keaton knew who was about to kill him, the sigh and the way he says Kaizer implies he realised he got played, should of know better, and now he knows who that person really is. Other hints, Verbal emotion when he told the story he believed about Kaizer. and also when they were watching the boat he knew specifically that they were speaking Hungarian.So all in all this is a good film, the genius being that everything makes sense and there are hints throughout about Verbal."
"I'd heard people say what a great movie ""The Usual Suspects"" was for a long time, but never got around to watching it...until tonight. I discovered it was available to watch instant stream on Netflix and decided to go ahead and give it a go. I've got to say, I'm pretty disappointed in it.Once again, I feel I fell victim to hype. People hyped this movie up to be awesome, and I just don't think it was. In my opinion, the movie was OK at best.The performances were all good. It's just that the movie was so slow...I couldn't believe that it's running time was a slim one hour and forty-five minutes. It felt like it was about two hours and twenty minutes to me.Then, I just felt the ""big reveal"" at the end was a little hokey. I mean, if you're that great of a criminal mastermind you would've had your BS story made up long before you ever entered an interrogation room -- for Kevin Spacey's character to have supposedly come up with the details for his story based off what he'd seen on a bulletin board...I'm sorry, but I've got to cry foul! If you've already got the story made up, you're not going to need to find inspiration for names of characters off a bulletin board, but I realize if he hadn't have gotten the names off the bulletin board, the audience wouldn't have really known he was lying the whole time. I get that, but I think the ending requires too much suspension of disbelief.I'm sure most people who like this movie like it because of its ending. Maybe if you take it for what it is, at a surface level, it might work...but once you start digging a little deeper and actually think about what you've just watched...it's not that great of an ending.I'll give it some credit for trying to go a different way than most movies of its type do, but that's about all I can really give it credit for. The movie itself was just really slow and didn't really pay off in the end, in my opinion, anyway.I'd give it maybe a five out of ten. That's about all the more I think it deserves. It wasn't GREAT, it wasn't HORRIBLE...it was just OK.You can check it out if you want to, but I wouldn't go so far as to say I'd recommend it. Take that for what it's worth coming from an anonymous movie reviewer."
"This film has got to be one of the greatest in recent history. The ending superb, the acting of the highest caliber, this film shines as the most memorable, clever, and re-watchable of this decade. I personally have seen The Usual Suspects over fifty times, and each time I learn something new. Last year I watched the movie every day for a month, twice a day on weekends. It doesn't matter that I know what happens to each character, it doesn't matter that the end is already placed in the back of my mind, just waiting to explode onto the screen before my eyes in a visual and psychological masterpiece.When I call the film memorable, I would cite the acting of Kevin Spacey as a prime example. His performance almost makes the end forgetable (even after I've spent so long spouting how memorable the film is. Bare with me, it all makes sense when you take a step back). As I watch from start to finish, I get so wrapped up in the story, and in searching for minor details that I definitely missed the first fifty times (the first six or seven times you are too busy grinning at the obvious facial gestures and body language that you missed the first time around that almost guide you to the logical, yet completely loopey climax), that it never gets boring to me. I will probably continue to watch this incredible movie for the rest of my life.The supporting cast each lends a little to the overall high quality of this film, in their own way. Postlethwaite is a tall, dark, mysterious enigma; Baldwin is a loud, comedic psychopath; Del Toro adds a quirky accent and sex appeal; Pollack comes through with spunk and charm; Palminteri shines as the arm of the law with pizazz; Byrne is the wistful dreamer, searching for the straight life, caught in a snare between the law that holds him down and the unrelenting crime world that calls him deeper into the criminal fold; and Spacey, well my dear Kevin Spacey is the highlight of the film, innocent and true to his feelings, observant, worthy of sympathy, and admiration towards the end, and the Oscar is well deserved for this stellar performance.The movie is action packed and well rounded, leaving the viewing audience stunned, baffled, bewildered, and ready to watch again. After the last line is uttered I feel like I did the first time I watched the film, completely in awe for the master deception. I recommend this movie to everyone I know (and don't know for that matter), for it is truly what a movie should be: entertaining and thought provoking. It is my favorite movie of all time (slyly beating out Gone with the Wind)."
"*SPOILERS*  ONLY FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE *SPOILERS*  ONLY FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE *SPOILERS*  ONLY FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN THE MOVIEThe movie script hangs on one completely implausible premise...  That Keyser Soze would throw away $91 million which was left on the dock in order to achieve his true goal.Also, no plausible explanation as to why Verbal Kint was in police custody in the first place. If he really is who we are led to think he is, wouldn't he be clever enough to not get caught? Is it some sort of game he plays with the police?Too many holes in the script, a very sloppy story... but great fun and well acted.  Just don't think about it too much."
"Lets see. There's a kaiser who is considered a real bad ass because he gunned down his wife and little kids. Real macho, yes? He doesn't exist, but he does? He can't be killed (like we haven't seen this before). His imagination and creativity are so bad he can't even come up with names or stories, but has to take them off of coffee cups and posters. Add to this, the entire story. He orders a police line up, but the police don't know who ordered the line up. Now, we all know most police departments are incompetent, but this belongs on the NAKED GUN series. Then there are the characters. According to the narrator, they can't be broken, because they are hoodlums. Talk about your street myth that people in power would love to have you believe! But it doesn't wash. It isn't even remotely credible. And no one cares. I happen to be watching it while working on something else, and was in a public place where they showed it twice. I naturally assumed it was some sort of ""Worst films"" festival, which it might have been. I was stunned to see it ranked so high on any critic's list. Now, for the reality. That was the surface appearance on first viewing. The writers claim it's just fluff, but it doesn't make a bit of sense as noir.It makes complete sense as a supernatural thriller, though. It will take a few viewings to realize that the original line up of suspects had a replacement, just as Wargrave replaced one of his victims in Ten Little Indians. The fifth ""suspect"" is actually Keaton's girl friend, and we get clues from the clandestine meetings they have. The ending tells us that they actually played with the devil, and tried to make a contract to outwit him. The ""five suspects"" are the five who dared to challenge the devil's turf, and the clues are there, but so subtle that the entire team of writers, director, everyone, failed to see them."
"A crime thriller that isn't about redemption or revenge or much anything at all, ""Suspects"" isn't a movie as much as a display of a director's obsessive lust for the criminal underworld. Director Bryan Singer likes rain soaked gutters, burning cigarettes, crooked cops, clever retorts, smoky pool halls and menacing tough guys. Characters don't populate this movie. Attitude does. The movie isn't interested in where these guys came from, what motivates them, what their struggles are. Without struggle, there's no tension; without tension, there's no suspense; and a crime thriller without suspense exists only to covet the unpleasant, the nasty.With a quick pace, flamboyant cinematography, and lines like, ""brought in on trumped up charges to be leaned on by half-wits"", the movie insists that it's crafty and clever, but fails with characters who can't come alive beyond brief sketches. Hockney is a surly slob; Fenster dresses in sharp suits and mumbles; McManus is wild and temperamental; Keaton is grumpy; Kint is soft-spoken and club-footed. As dialogue exists here only to move characters from one place to the next, it could really be assigned to anyone. Similar lines like ""I'll f--k your father in the shower"", ""I did it to your mother's a-s"", and ""At least I don't have a captain with his d--k in my a-s all day long"", uttered by three separate characters, generate the impression that a single trash talking lowlife is inhabiting five people.The events of the plot have no significance either. The team robs a group of crooked cops in New York, then travels to Los Angeles to pull off another job for a guy called Redfoot, and are finally enlisted by Soze's assistant Kobayashi to steal cocaine. Kint's account of the first two jobs takes about an hour of film time. It'd be of no consequence if it were left out. The heists are redundant and advance the characters in no way at all: Keaton is still grumpy, Hockney is still surly, they all still call each other ""cocksucker."" The first hour exists only for the stimulation of watching thugs wave guns and beat people up. The film's sense of aprogress, of stalled, redundant cycles, inhabits the interrogation between Kujan and Kint. The characters never progress beyond a pattern of friendliness, petulance, aggression, a big blow-up, threats, ceasefire and then all over again.Verbal's account is presented as objective. He has no reason to lie, so we wouldn't expect him to. However, the film lets us know a minute before it's over that everything we have seen is made up. Apparently, Verbal, using things in the interrogation room for material, mostly the bulletin board behind Kujan, tricked the cop and the film's audience. A post-it note about a guy named Redfoot becomes the character Redfoot, a mug by ""Kobayashi"" becomes Soze's assistant Kobayashi, and so on. Realizing that a supposedly objective narrator has misled us, we re-evaluate everything that has come before. What really happened? How does the lie illuminate the rest of the story? Singer supplies no answers. Kint walks out of Kujan's office, ending the film.One could say that the filmmakers have done this deliberately, that the absence of character, distinct truth, and connection between events is deliberate. That Singer is a nihilist and this is his view of the world. A viable worldview, fine, but his film can't escape being an antagonistic prank on its audience. Singer uses familiar storytelling tools and setups to snare us and as the story develops, he entices our imaginations with more and more clues to figure out the puzzle. We're intrigued because he's telling us there's an answer, that all this is going somewhere, that every scene and every line is a piece to the puzzle. He dares us to pay attention so maybe we can figure it out before the film does. Riddles do the same thing. For instance, the answer to the riddle, ""I'm trying to go home but I can't because the man in the mask; who is the man in the mask?,"" is ""the Catcher."" When we find that out, we take pleasure in knowing that the answer was there, all we had to do was think and see the obvious from a different perspective.""Suspects"" disappoints because the answer was never there for us to see. Customs agent Kujan only notices the material on the bulletin board when he leans up close to it. Whenever the camera lingers with Kint, nothing on the board can be seen distinctly. More important, the film never cues us that Kint might be making it all up. His total immunity from prosecution gives him no reason to waste Kujan's and our time for the entire length of a movie. What Singer ends up doing is cannibalizing the very genre of storytelling he admires. He mocks the thrill of expectation used to tantalize us, only to say that there is no puzzle. Singer's answer to the riddle about the Catcher is the illogic of ""there is no man."" Much like Verbal Kint's lies, Singer's charade can only be taken as the snub that it is."
"The Usual Suspects is one of those films that like The 6th Sense, tries to get the viewer to think one thing and then suddenly POW!, they hit you with that big comic book like surprise twist at the ending. In the light of todays average fair full of pounding soundtracks, pyrotechnics, and product placements, it almost seems like a thinking mans film, however, this type of story telling has an inherent birth defect due to the very nature of its design, and that is that once you've seen it, the films one true claim of quality is forever lost, the carpet can not be pulled out from under your feet a second time. In essence, it becomes as pointless as trying to dazzle yourself at a magic show when you already know all the secrets behind every trick. Outside of this built in defect there is also the problem that the trick itself is actually very badly designed in the first place, this is in reality a very poorly constructed, and badly written script. This film has been embraced and awarded the highest honors, and yet there is not a single moment in it that isn't bogged down and convoluted, or even one bit plausible.At the end of the film the other cop who works in the office where Verbal Kent is interrogated tells Inspector Kujan ( Chazz Palminteri )that to basically understand his messy office, you just have to stand back and look at it to see it, the same exact thing can be said about this equally unorganized film. To truly understand this lets stand back and actually take a look at the character of Keaton, played very dully by the very dull Gabriel Byrne. He was a NYPD officer for 4 years even though he is a Brit. In that short time he spent on the force he committed seven felonies, three of which were murders. Not a single one of these crimes could be pinned on him because the witnesses either died or changed their stories entirely, yet as an obvious embarrassment to the department, he was kicked off the force. When he is off the Force he gets indited on a fraud charge and does five years in prison. While in prison he kills three fellow inmates, but just like his other crimes, none of these atrocities could be pinned on him, so he simply gets out when his time is up. Once on the streets he kills yet again, but before he could be prosecuted for it, he dies in a warehouse fire when he goes in to check a leaking gas main. Once dead, the two witnesses that could of railroaded him back to Sing Sing die in single mysterious deaths, and even though there are no longer any witnesses left breathing, an innocent man takes his place behind bars. So now he surfaces as a business man who dates a high priced criminal lawyer. Thats his story folks, told to you specifically to get you to buy that he is this arch super-villain with the ridiculously bad name. Meanwhile this film does all it can to paint Verbal Kent as a bumbling idiotic club footed buffoon con man. The problem with all this blatant manipulation is that Kevin Spacey might as well have the name Keser Soze stenciled across forehead in bright neon letters.Another place this film falls short is in its attempt to be a two fisted tough guy movie, lets face it, the only female character that even has a name, is simply in the movie as a reason to move the protagonist like pawns on a chest board at convenient times in this contorted plot, so what we are left with is the five criminals, who like small grade school children, spend half the movie puffing their chests out at one another. One scene that never fails to get a good laugh out of me is when Kevin Pollack and Stephen Baldwin almost get into a fight with one another. Possibly for reasons of keeping both men in the frame, director Bryan Singer has these two guys standing toe to toe facing one another with their mouths only a few inches apart, instead of looking like a fisticuff might take place, it looks far more likely that they might engage in a lusty soul kiss. This nice moment is capped of by brilliantly by a disembodied macho voice calling them ladies, and Kevin Pollack asking the Baldwin brother if he wants to dance. The fun continues in a later scene in which the Baldwin character comes up behind Pete Postlethwaite as if he might mount him any second, and whispers in his ear ""I'm the guy thats gonna get you."" Yes, due to inept story tellers and bad dialogue, what might of been Clint Eastwoon like one liners, is reduced in the hands of these hacks, into homoeroticism running wild.I know that audiences continue to be impressed by this film, and that this thing won an Oscar for its script, but this story is nothing but a clunky ludicrous mess wrapped up in a bow of paper thin phony freshness, it simply does not deserve all of the love it is getting. The Usual Suspects is a film that makes me want to quit my day job and move to Hollywood, since tripe is so often confused with genius."
"*** WARNING: SPOILERS ***I was loving this movie -- LOVING it -- until the climax. So Kevin Spacey's character's been making it all up as he goes along? Most amusing. And the storyline to which we were wholeheartedly devoting ourselves for the previous 100 minutes (or whatever) turns out to be a neat conman's trick? How delightfully clever. And how completely cynical of the moviemakers. It's their prerogative to take their script in any direction it suits them to, but I couldn't help but feel cheated -- I had actually wanted to know what the outcome of the plot (or what I thought was the plot) would be, not be fobbed off with some kind of superior ""you were actually going along with this guy's cornball story? You IDIOT!"" attitude. To me, this movie is nothing more than a clever-clever scriptwriting exercise -- all ""look what I can do, ma!"", and no heart."
"The Usual Suspects is one of those movies that you expect to be good because all your fiends say it's good.  People are afraid to say how lousy this is, because their friends will get on them.  But I will say it.  #1, Stephen Baldwin is in it...so how good can it be?  #2 Kevin Spacey is a criminal. He lies to the police and makes up a story to cover his own butt.  The cops have busted him, and instead of confessing, he makes up a lie about the Kaiser.  This movie is considered original? A criminal lies to the police?? THAT is so original?  It happens every single day, people!!!  I can't believe so many people like this movie.  It's about a crook who lies to the cops...like there's something original or shocking about that.  Think about it.  Do you really like this movie because of Stephen Baldwin and a man telling a lie, or do you like it because you know you're supposed to like it..."
"A fine example of a movie trying really hard to be a Rubik's Cube.  When a movie starts tripping over itself just for the sake of complicating the plot--that's when I throw up my hands and say, ""Enough already!""  It stops being entertaining and enjoyable and begins to be nothing but a chore.  I tried to like this movie, but after being introduced to about 300 characters who all look and act alike (their names even rhyme, for God's sake!), and when the plot demands that we memorize all sorts of details about each one of them to follow the story, that when it stops being fun.  I felt like I was working overtime just to keep up with this mess.When the ending is finally sprung, and I thought about it in the context of the rest of the movie, it should have all made sense, justifying the over-complicated story, but it didn't.  Holes opened up large enough for houses to fall through.  It seemed as if the writer just threw in the most unlikely possibility to astonish the audience.  After the maze he leads us through, it's easy to forget why this doesn't make sense.  It's a real cheap shot."
"I get it and yet, I don't -- and wonder how many people REALLY do understand the finale -- or are they just caught up in the flash and sizzle of a fantastic ride with a surprise destination?  Sure - it's an awesome adventure, but does it REALLY take you anywhere?Yes, yes, yes...  It goes unsaid that first and foremost, an outstanding ensemble cast, superb dialog & script, and truly a piece that keeps one riveted...BUT(SPOILER) - If Verbal's explanation of what happened, detailing all the names, events, locations - If these were all made up, created based on the bulletin board postings and items in the office where he was interrogated...then did any of these events really happen?  Was there a Kobyashi, a Redfoot, etc., or was it all just an elaborate story?  Based on the ending - Verbal's story was a just a great improv.  BUT - if these events were all fictitious, then how did we really involve our crew in everything that occurred, up to and including the ship heist and explosion? If there is no real substance to Verbal's explanation, how can we have a real outcome??Is it me -- or is this just a cutting edge Wizard of Oz, with us first questioning who the Wizard is - And then, trying to solve -- was any of this real or just fantasy - a dream?  I love this flick, primarily because of the superior cast performance -- but I can honestly say I don't really understand it -- or is this the way I'm supposed to feel?  It truly makes my head hurt!"
"What a waste! Even if this is a ""well-crafted"" movie, none of the characters are likable, no one but the evil Satanic figure survives, and nothing good comes out of any of their lives. So maybe it's well made, well acted and well directed. So was the Third Reich! Usual Suspects was recommended to me (I should have more carefully considered the source) and my wife and daughter watched it with me. They both agreed there were no redeeming qualities in this film. It's dark, convoluted, and full of loopholes. The most outragious loophole is the fact that Kaiser Soze takes painstaking measures to eliminate the one person who can identify him, all the while appearing in public so much that by the end when he is revealed, everyone in the world will know what he looks like! DUH! I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys hearing the F word in nearly every conversation and who derives pleasure seeing scores of people murdered mindlessly. This is the movie for you!"
"I almost feel sorry for anybody who likes this pretentious crap.Mostly everyone who does like it only likes it for one reason...the big twist at the end. But anybody with half a brain that is at least partially functioning can see through the transparent and poorly-written script and predict the ending by the half-hour mark.Spoilers ahead. Do yourself a favor and read them rather than wasting your time watching this mess of a film.OK, the basic plot...cripple is being questioned by a police officer at the police station. The cripple tells the cop about past events that supposedly happened. The stories the cripple tells all seem to contradict one another, and the cop is getting very annoyed since he can't seem to find out the real identity of the man behind the previous events...a man named Keyser Sose.But who is Keyser Sose? I'll tell you who just by explaining what any intelligent movie viewer would have been thinking the entire time, and that is this. Keyser Sose can only be one person, and that person is Verbal Kint. And the reason why he has to be Keyser Sose is because he is the only person that is involved in the story from start to finish. Nobody else is in the office but Verbal and the cop, and we know the cop didn't do it (although that would have been an actual good twist), so it must be Verbal. Can't be any of the other ""suspects"" because, what if it was? Then the story would move somewhere else and Verbal would no longer be involved.Which brings me to another major flaw...why the hell is Verbal even there in the first place? Him going to the police station serves no purpose at all.And as I patiently waited for the extremely transparent conclusion to be revealed as exactly what I predicted the whole time, I thought of one thing...Verbal is a cripple, so he can't possibly be Keyser Sose. But that was nothing more than a cheap red-herring used only to intentionally throw the viewer off in a different direction. Didn't work very well at all.Why else is this movie total crap? The directing is cheap and thoughtless, acting is decent at best but even that's stretching it, cinematography looks ugly as hell, and I didn't care about any character in the whole movie at all. Didn't give a hell if anybody lived or died. All that paired with the fact that the entire movie was built around the idea of a surprise ending with no substance of itself makes this a piece of garbage.Wait, I'm sorry. Comparing this movie to garbage would be insulting to things I throw away."
"... arrgghhhlll, I can't. Sorry. Why everybody loves this overblown mess is simply beyond me. Yes, this movie is a mess ! Who to blame ? Well, if you ask me, the movie's faults lie within the awful (nonetheless Oscar-winning)(Ah, there's no justice in this world, is it... ?) script, which goes great pains to tell a story that just isn't there. Ever realized that the final ""twist"" actually doesn't twist anything at all ? So Kevin Spacey was Keyser Soze all along. Boo Hoo. Great Twist, really. Pretty much renders the two hours of movie we endured before it quite useless, doesn't it ? Awful scene-chewery by Gabriel Byrne, too. Well, it's not like this guy isn't awful at everything he does..."
"From a directing perspective, The Usual Suspects is a flawless masterpiece with immaculate script writing and a rare show of top notch ensemble cast acting. Benecio Del Toro makes genius choices, Kevin Spacey was brilliant and I believe was handed the greatest of opportunities with such a will scripted role. This movie really put Kevin Spacey on the map, but everyone in the ensemble cast is outstanding. Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Benicio, Spacey....the list of appearances goes on and on and only sets the bar higher far any movie with a comparable storyline and cast.Christopher McQuarrie's inspirationally written script, is one of the finest of the the cinema era. The Oscar was well deserved for this piece of work, unlike many politically nominated and won Oscars. This was acknowledged because the work lived up to the praise."
"Yeah, the film has a very neat ending, real neat. However, in the scheme of things, what else does this film have? Not much. This was one of those pretty good films that gets tagged with the ""Great"" label, all because it is a little different from the mainstream crap being turned out at Studio City. This is not an epic film, I am sorry. Spacey was good Byrne was good and the ending was clever, but if you take a long hard look at the whole film, you will see average movie making. I just don't see the greatness in the overall film. Now ""Frailty"", there is a movie that improves on what this film wanted to be."
"The Usual Suspect is one of those films which tell you that seeing is believing. Don't get me wrong it was a very good film and I am glad I finally got the chance to see it but with critics going on and on about it, they kind of kill the magic of the movie. However that really did not hinder my enjoyment as I decided to treat this just like any other movie. Basic concept of 5 cons on various heist missions until one goes terribly wrong and then the authorities try to establish what went wrong hearing this from the account of one of the crippled crooks (Kevin Spacey). Gabreil Bryne was a excellent in his role as the lead crook and Benico Del Toro was also a stand out performance but we all know that Kevin Spacey was the man who took joy in playing the audience like a piano. A film can start of slow but the ending is the most important thing in the whole thing and I am glad to say that this ending was nothing short of a slap in the face.THE USUAL SUSPECTS - 8.1 OUT 10 THE GREATEST TRICK THAT THE DEVIL EVER PULLED WAS CONVINCING THE WORLD THAT HE DOESN'T EXHIST AND JUST LIKE THAT..... HE'S GONE !"
".......................................................from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FLSUSPECTS larger-than-life allure results from a seamless blending of elements: Psychodrama, Action, Suspense and Mystery, all built on intricate storytelling, a dynamic screenplay and taut direction, by Bryan Singer. The aforementioned are all bolstered by credible in-depth character development, brought to life by an outstanding cast, who flesh out each role to chilling near perfection. (Kevin Spacey, seen here before most people would have recognized his name, received an Oscar for his ""supporting"" role!) But let's not get sidetracked. More than anything else,""SUSPECTS"" is about the unparalleled unsettling reaction you get from viewing it! From the first scene to the end credits, it gets a headlock on your psyche, while sending the pit of your stomach into endless free fall! The only way to illustrate this, without giving away any key elements of the film, is a detailed look at the opening scene....a peerless example of instant timeless classic film noir.On a boat, docked in San Pedro Harbor, the dying sole-survivor of an apparently devastating bloodbath shootout painfully ignites a thin trail of gasoline. His obvious intention: Destroy EVERYTHING...himself included! From a deck higher up, an unseen someone pisses out the trail of flames. The shadowy figure walks down the stairs with an unhurried deliberation and saunters over to the agonizing man he has just saved. They exchange somewhat forced greetings and a few disjointed words of banter.Without warning, the intruder firmly raises a pistol, his unblinking gaze reflected in eyes locked in contact with his own. Unhesitatingly, he fires two consecutive shots. A brief pause of contemplation ends when he casually lights a cigarette, strategically dropping his lighter to rekindle the liquid fuse, and then beats a hasty off-board retreat. What better way to introduce a character whose twisted iron resolve is so perverse, so deranged, that he saves a doomed man seconds before certain death, solely for the unmitigated pleasure derived from looking him squarely in the eye, his victim looking right back, while pulling the trigger himself.Without uttering a syllable, his actions shout out, ""I p**s on you and your puny existence!"" His victim's final moments are thusly converted into a living/dying testimony, clearly demonstrating who it is that decides the particulars of when and how he will die! ""SUSPECTS"" has been severely critiqued by a vocal minority (to paraphrase another reviewer) for not knowing the difference between a plot twist and a non sequitur. With all due respect to the reviewer, who painstakingly highlighted the difference for us, perhaps a careful second viewing would shed some light on the source of this common confusion. After watching ""SUSPECTS"" four times making every effort to employ my most discerning eye, I am convinced the true genius of the movie hinges on this particular point! Let me underscore my unequivocal recommendation of this film with a special note to those of you who avoid the Action or Suspense genre because of your distaste of the excessive violence that generally characterizes them. Well, THIS IS NO Robert Rodriguez FILM! A lot of the scenes are done in the ""Old School"" style, where the violence is kept off-screen. Although there is considerable TALK in ""SUSPECTS"" about some of the most dastardly deeds imaginable, virtually none of this is graphically portrayed. So, PLEASE, if you have not seen it yet, because of this reason, I urge you to make an exception in this case...10* STARS*! GET IT AND SEE IT!......ENJOY/DISFRUTELA! Any comments, questions or observations, in English or EspaÃ±ol, are most welcome!"
"1995's beautifully structured ""The Usual Suspects"" is really a very simple story. One of only two survivors of a ship explosion (Kevin Spacey) tells a story to the police detective (Chazz Palminteri) in charge of the case about how five career criminals - the ""usual suspects"" - met in a lineup and wound up working for the man whose very name strikes terror into the hearts of men - Keyser Soze.As a result, two names were on everybody's lips for some months to come: Kevin Spacey and Keyser Soze.With a crackerjack script by Christopher Quarrie, great direction by Bryan Singer and terrific performances, The Usual Suspects couldn't miss. And it doesn't. Thirteen years later, I remember it as vividly as the day I saw it. I just saw it again, and it's as good as ever.Its other stars are the handsome Gabriel Byrne as Keaton, a bad cop who at one point faked his death to avoid criminal charges; and Stephen Baldwin, Benicio del Toro, still a distance from stardom, Kevin Pollak, and Giancarlo Esposito as Kobayashi, Keyser Soze's persuasive assistant.As a scared, not very bright gimpy man, Kevin Spacey is a knockout and well-deserving of his Oscar, his Golden Globe, his SAG Award, his New York Film Critics Award and all his other honors. The writer, Christopher McQuarrie, justly won the Oscar and several other awards. The film and director Singer probably deserved more awards than they received, but it doesn't matter. The Usual Suspects is a modern classic.The greatest trick the devil ever played was convincing the world he didn't exist...and then he's gone."
"In the beginning of ""The Usual Suspects,"" a man is killed on the deck of a ship, and suddenly an explosion completely tears apart the docked ship. Flash forward to the next day. Dave Kujan (Chazz Palimenteri) is forcing a statement out of the only surviver of the explosion, Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey, in the role that made him a star). Verbal recalls the last few weeks to Dave, who listens intently.We start when five criminals are brought in for a line-up. There's McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollack), and Verbal Kint. While they are being held in prison, the five men all agree that the police just need someone to pin the crime they are suspected of on someone. They all agree to plan revenge by forming a league of crime...Lotta stuff happens, next we know a legendary criminal named Keizer Soze (whose name reminds me of a type of food) has the five men under his control. He makes them steal drugs off a docked ship, and as we see in the beginning, the men all die save Verbal. Hmm, who could Keizer Soze be? How did all the people die? Who is Lara Croft? Oops, wrong tagline.""The Usual Suspects"" is a very good film, but not one of my favorites. It's extremely catchy, brutal, etc., but comes across slightly shallow. The ending, though surprising, doesn't really click together as well as some other films with surprises. I wasn't confused by the ending, I understood it, I just thought it was a bit shallow compared to some other flicks.MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD!In the end we find out Kevin Spacey is Keizer Soze...I think...or is he Soze's henchman? Or is Soze just a legend? It's open to debate. But what makes it a bit more shallow from other films is that Verbal Kint is the one who tells this long story to Dave Kujan, and assumably he made most of it up because he was the criminal all along and had to cover himself up...so there's no real ""wow!"" element. If Verbal made up the story and turns out to be the man behind the killings, well, it's just a bit shallow as compared to some other films. We are expected to be amazed that he is Soze, but if the tale he told Kujan and us was for the most part a lie, then the fact that he was Soze all along isn't quite as amazing...umm...do you understand what I'm saying?But I'm not saying I dislike this movie. In fact, that's far from it. I really enjoyed this flick. It's terrific. Great performances by the entire cast, especially Spacey, who won an Oscar for his role. Even Stephen Baldwin was good in this movie!""The Usual Suspects"" is a lot like ""Basic,"" a film starring John Travolta. There are a lot of plot twists, but the duration of the film is a bunch of lies, and many of the ""twists"" don't make sense, and are there simply to confuse the audience into thinking something else. Behind all the gloss there isn't a whole lot there. But ""The Usual Suspects"" is still a great film, and though the end is slightly shallow, and the duration of the film is an excuse for the ending, it's still surprising and effective. And unlike ""Basic"" which dragged on for over two hours, ""The Usual Suspects"" knows when to stop its banter and get to the point.Effective film-making, but slightly overrated and shallow.4.5/5 stars -John Ulmer"
"Going in to this movie, I knew what the twist ending was. A friend of mine told me about it a while back, but I didn't really care because I didn't plan on seeing the movie. Well recently I saw that it was on Netflix and decided to see if it was as great as everyone had said it was. After watching I can't really understand why people are raving over this movie. The movie was boring for most of its running time and didn't feel any better than a mediocre crime film. Even though Kevin Spacey won an Oscar for his performance, I thought his acting in this movie didn't even compare to his role in American Beauty or even Seven (where he didn't win the Oscar).I know some people might say that I might have enjoyed the movie better if I didn't know the true identity of Kevin Spacey's character before I watched that movie. That may be true in a little sense, but that shouldn't be the whole reason why I didn't care at all for this movie. A WHOLE MOVIE CANNOT BE ENTIRELY RELIANT ON A TWIST. If a movie was so great, it should have other elements that make it great. Not just the twist at the end! For instance, I recently watched the movie Gone Girl and I knew the twist of that movie because I had read the book beforehand. Just because I knew what was going to happen in that movie that didn't stop me having a great time watching the film. Another thing about the twist is that while watching the movie there were no clues given to the audience (clipboard or anything else was not seen). The movie makers never gave us an opportunity to second guess the true identity of Kevin Spacey's character. Therefore watching the movie a second time doesn't feel any different because you wouldn't be able see any clues about the ending. A twist is supposed to enhance the viewing experience (something the twist of The Usual Suspects doesn't do at all). All in all this movie is vastly overrated. I believe some people get so caught up in the twist of this film that they were blindsided to how boring the film was for most of it's running time."
"After a bloodbath and fire on a moored ship only the badly burned Hngarian mobster Arkosh Kovash (Morgan Hunter) and the crippled small- time crook Roger ""Verbal"" Kint (Kevin Spacey) survive. Agent Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) interrogates Verbal that explains what happened to Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak) and him in the vessel. Six weeks ago, they met each other at the line-up in the police station and decide to team-up for a heist under the command of the former corrupt cop Keaton. After delivering the jewels to the fence Redfoot (Peter Greene), they are hired for another heist and then the lawyer Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) approaches to them and tell that the notorious Hungarian gangster Keyser SÃ¶ze had offered them to go to the ship to destroy the cocaine they are transporting. They go to the ship and do not find any drug, and Keyser SÃ¶ze killed each one of them. Who is Keyser SÃ¶ze?Twenty-two years after the releasing date, ""The Usual Suspects"" is still a great film that has not aged. The impact reduces a little if the viewer still recalls who Keyser SÃ¶ze is, but the film is still one of the best of the genre. Kevin Spacey was not well-known and Bryan Singer was in the beginning of his career, but the direction and performances are top-notch. The screenplay is one of the best written in the cinema history for a mystery film and the result is a fantastic movie. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Os Suspeitos"""
"language a bit confusing during boat attack, where were cops? hard to like anyone in film""The Usual Suspects"" is a well-made film from start to finish and I do recommend you see it...maybe. Let me explain. While the film is excellent it also is unpleasant, violent, filled with expletives (particularly the old f-bomb) and has nothing but unlikable characters. For me, films like this, ""Good Fellas"" and ""The Fight Club"" are just pretty nasty films--but still, they are quality films--unpleasant quality films. The film is a very confusing story about a gang of five guys who meet in the oddest way--at a police lineup! The five decide to get together for an illegal job and soon end up being extorted to do a job for 'Keyser Soze'-- man who no one seems to know but who inspires fear in those who hear his name (sort of like Valdemort). I'd say more, but frankly I don't want to ruin the film. Suffice to say, it's a film with a BIG twist--like ""The Fight Club"" or ""The Crying Game"" and so I'll stop with that.The bottom line is if you like violent films with very graphic violence and language, then ""The Usual Suspects"" is for you. The acting, writing and directing are great. If you would rather see films a bit more uplifting or family-friendly, do NOT see this film! Seriously."
"Subtlety is a very important thing in any good thriller. Not only does subtlety reduce the ridiculous amount of ""in-your-face-quality"" that today's thrillers seem to love, which effectively makes then just plain old action movies, subtlety shows that a film has respect for its audience. It doesn't feel like it has to explain everything at every step of the way since it knows that an interested audience will be on the lookout for hints as to what is going on. That's what makes films like this enjoyable. In fact, that what makes any film enjoyable. It isn't just a barrage of images, but rather an engaging sequence of them. This sequence can be unchronologically organized or in any number of ways obscured to create suspense, but as long as it is engaging, the audience will be happy.""The Usual Suspects"" is such a thriller. It can be enjoyed with the eyes as much as the brain. There are numerous hints as to what is really going on and the final climatic twist is really a great one. Even then, upon seeing the whole film, the second viewing only gets better as that is when a keen viewer will pick up on all those subtleties that hint at the result which they are now familiar with. These subtleties are not just obscurely placed props but are woven into the film's montage with clever camera angles along with certain key objects seen on screen. It is a thriller worthy of Hitchcock or the best of DePalma. Nothing is in needless excess and even the profanity is well written and there are no pointless macho wisecracks. Simply put, everything works in this movie. And it works very well. Even upon multiple viewings the film captivates with its clever composition and that can only be a good sign. --- 10/10Rated R for violence and profanity. Ages 13+"
"I don't like this movie. I think it's extremely boring. The first time I saw it I just kept on thinking ""When is something actually going to happen?"" Most of the movie they just talk and talk. The ending is fine, but the rest of the movie cannot at all stand up to it. I guess the director and scriptwriters had a very bad day when they decided to make this movie. That day they made a mistake - the movie should never have been made. My recommendation: don't see Usual Suspects, it's a complete waste of time."
"This movie was so boring that I had to fast forward through scenes just to get through it.  I figured out the ""surprise"" within the first 20 minutes of the movie, so I don't see what the big deal over that was - could it have been more obvious?  Finally, the stupid, melodramatic way that they handled the scenes and dialogue was tedious and insulting."
"right, so this movie is really clever?... at no point are we given any clues regarding the twist... so it could have been anything... how bout i write a movie where a guy tells a story about a heist and all the things that happen, and then everyone gets killed by aliens that appear out of the blue in the last minute of the movie?... what a twist!... you never would have seen that coming! despite that, the ending is very predictable... the fact that kint is the only one left is a dead giveaway... i'm usually terrible at spotting the ending of even the most predictable Hollywood fare, and i had this one pegged 20 minutes from the start...so is the script any good WITHOUT the twist?... i think quentin Tarantino has got the funny banter between tough guys down pat, but this movie?... total snoozefest... just a bunch of one dimensional hoods engaged in a boring, pointless quest (i couldn't even be bothered to follow the story as without the twist, it's very dull)...you know, they accuse shyamalam of being a one trick pony, but at least the sixth sense has some good acting, atmospherics, a creepy story and a script... some type of silent fascination...this movie is unbelievably overrated... i might have given it a 4 or a 5 but it really deserves to be taken down a peg or two, as i cannot see ANY justification for this being in the IMDb top 250, flawed list or not...and if i have one more person with a joint tell me it's genius, i'm going to puke... i hear that expression the emperor's clothes bandied around a lot on the IMDb, and if there's any movie on these boards that does deserve that over-used put down... well you know where to find the usual suspects..."
"Before I watched the movie, I've read many comments comparing ""The Usual Suspects"" with ""L.A. Confidential"", which concluded that this one is even better. So I held an eminent anticipation on it. But two hours later, I just could not understand why this nonsense got so much higher votes and evaluation than ""L.A. Confidential"".I'm saying this, not because of the labels people usually will put on this movie: confusing, twisted and so on. Actually, I don't think the plot is hard to comprehend. To be honest, I figured out who Kaiser is just at the very beginning. It was so obvious.The reason is, many fabulous elements in ""L.A. Confidential"", or should I say, a successful movie, are missing. First of all, the most important thing: the vivid sculpture of the characters. From ""L.A. Confidential"", we remember the three young cops, the evil captain, the gorgeous hooker, the sly and sneaky little old news reporterÂ… So many impressive roles there. But what is in ""The Usual Suspects""? I feel sorry to say, nothing. Maybe Kevin Spacey's performance can be a little compensation, but not enough at all.Second of all, the conflict. In ""L.A. Confidential"", conflicts are everywhere, between justice and crime, between righteousness and personal career, between love and cheat, between different parts or even in the deep soul of one part. While in ""The Usual Suspects"", without these conflicts, the movie is not dramatic and attractive but cadaverous and boring.The third one, ambiance. In ""L.A. Confidential"", I can sense the emotion the director planed to deliver to us. Sometimes intensive, sometimes thrilling, sometimes dangerous, sometimes love-filling, sometimes nervous, sometimes horrifyingÂ….Well, when I watched this one, I almost fell asleep in the middle.I don't think we need a fourth reason to prove this crap. I hate these plays which consider themselves intelligent and tricky enough to make up some mendacious tales to bluff the audience, and turn out to be so stupid and fake. There is always a wire-puller in such movies, who seems to be omnipotent and can do whatever he wants, conniving some brilliant schemes. But finally these schemes are always deliberately mystifying and illogical. I prefer real and organized films like ""L.A. Confidential"". You know, we audience are also smart."
"As the plot unfolds, we as the audience, unknowingly becomes a part of the investigation of the truth. Glimpses of evidence and certain references are given from the very beginning."
"For the whole run time The Usual Suspects will entertain you with its interesting and well execiuted gangster story , but its unexpected ending will leave a viewer with conviction that he just witnessed something one of its kind."
"Always thought the title of this movie was the unusual suspects
welp figured that out the hard way"
"The Usual Suspects is a 1995 American neo-noir[3] mystery crime thriller film directed by Bryan Singer and written by Christopher McQuarrie. It stars Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Benicio del Toro, Kevin Pollak, Chazz Palminteri, Pete Postlethwaite and Kevin Spacey.The film follows the interrogation of Roger ""Verbal"" Kint, a small-time con man who is one of only two survivors of a massacre and fire on a ship docked at the Port of Los Angeles. He tells an interrogator a convoluted story about events that led him and his partners in crime to the boat, and about a mysterious mob boss known as Keyser SÃ¶ze who commissioned their work. Using flashback and narration, Kint's story becomes increasingly complex."
"After the fairly unknown ""Public Access"", this film was the second project by director Bryan Singer and screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie. And man, did it deliver. It won both Oscars (including one for McQuarrie) it was nominated for and, as of this day, stands on #26 of IMDb's highest rated films of all time. There's a good chance that, after you've watched The Usual Suspects, you may feel the urge to see it again not much after to focus on details you did not concentrate on during the first viewing. This is easily one of the best examples ever of how an unexpected ending can raise the quality of a film in the viewer's mind and even carry the one who came up with it to Oscar glory. Of course, that is not to say that everything that happened in the roughly 90 minutes before the final twist is rather forgettable. It certainly is not. It's a nice buildup.As for me, I was not too impressed with the whole story. What I did like, however, were the performances. Awards-wise, Spacey was the only standout, but almost the complete cast portrayed their characters convincingly. Spacey shines as the weak cripple whose skills in coordination and planning make him a valuable addition to the team. Pete Postlethwaite is second to none in the very few scenes he has and a truly magnetic presence. The look he gives Byrne's character out of the conference room is one of the highlights, just like the whole elevator/kidnapping scene before. And last but not least, said Gabriel Byrne delivers a great performance as an ex-cop, ex-criminal stuck between both worlds now. The way he portrays his inner conflict and his interactions with Spacey's character elevate the material a lot. When it came to the mysterious Keyser SÃ¶ze, I'm not sure how many of his scenes were really so memorable because of the quality or just because of the crassness. I'm mostly referring to the flashback including his family here. Nonetheless, the character is known to stand for an invisible evil force in pop culture talk to this day, soon 20 years later, and that's surely an impressive achievement.I recommend this film, if there's even anybody out there who still hasn't seen it. I don't think it's as good as its rating on this website suggests, but it's still a fairly entertaining 100 minutes, especially if cop/crime stories are among your genre preferences."
"This is a great movie, lots of twists and turns. Kept you guessing till the end. I saw this movie years after it came out and was surprised that the ending was never leaked out I was very surprised to find out at the end of the movie Verbal's true identity. A lot of well known actors were in this movie. Kevin Spacey did a wonderful performance. Kevin Pollack had a few one liners that were funny- his stand up act is very good. I thought it was hilarious when Pollack called Spacey peg leg. I really enjoyed the interaction between Stephen and Benico. They have good chemistry with one another. Chazz did a great job as the detective."
"One month ago, I was at work finishing some boring reports. After finishing them, I surfed the web in order to find really good movies I haven't watched yet; more precisely on IMDb, when I checked the IMDb Top 250 list out . I knew most of the movies, at least I've watched the plot, nevertheless this didn't happen with Usual Suspects, I have never watched a trailer or read some synopsisÂ…Nothing. Therefore I rented the movie which from my point of view started kind of slowly. Afterwards, I honestly felt confused about the combination of scenes in different timeline; you need to pay close attention to the unexpected and subtle movements on the storyline. Suspense, tension and psychological terror might be the exact words to describe this masterpiece, tangled story with several important characters whom cannot be ignored, with the masterly performance of Kevin Spacey who totally deserved the Oscar for best actor. You must stay hooked up to the screen because this film has in my opinion the best movie ending of all time. Only thing that sucks about this movie is that you can only watch it for the first time once."
"To be honest I thought this film was good up until the last ten minutes, thats when it became a great film. The preleptic techniques used was amazing so that by the end you are just as fooled as the characters in the story.Spacey's performance was excellent you really don't see the ending coming as a viewer it really comes right out of the blue, this film by the end is something so complex and really makes you think, without completely exhausting your mind it creates a paradox that I don't think anyone could figure out by the end. Yes, you are left with a few questions at the end, but thats the beauty of this film, as the case just ends in the film, the police are left and so are you as a viewer, however they don't leave annoying small links it instead ties up the main storyline well. It is truly an ending that is mind numbing and something that other films should definitely try to replicate.The story is so intricately written and portrayed that it is amazing to watch, and I noticed that the complexity of shots improves as the film progresses and the team venture into larger operations, yet even still Im left with the feeling that I could watch it again, and not see the ending coming again.Only negatives were for me the police investigation which proved to be completely irrelevant to the storyline, and so can be seen as a hindrance, but the rest of the film makes up for this.Intricate Storyline, complex but is made amazing by its ending."
"The Usual Suspects follows the interrogation of Roger ""Verbal"" Kint. Verbal is one of two survivors of a drug deal gone wrong at the Port of Los Angeles. He tells the interrogator, Kujan, a drawn-out story about events that led him and the four other ""usual suspects"" to the port the night the drug deal went wrong, leading to a fire and several casualties. At the beginning the five suspects are brought into questioning over a truck hijacking. The suspects are Michael McManus played by Stephen Baldwin, Dean Keaton played by Gabriel Byrne, Fred Fenster played by Benicio Del Toro, Todd Hockney played by Kevin Pollak, and Roger ""Verbal"" Kint played by Kevin Spacey.The theme of The Usual Suspects is that pride and arrogance lead to manipulation and betrayal. At the beginning of the film, none of the suspects will admit to anything that happened with the hijacking. We immediately see that these five men are arrogant but at the same time loyal, not throwing any of the other men under the bus so to speak. During the movie Kint manipulates the other ""usual suspects"" by playing puppet master without them even knowing it.This theme keeps true throughout the film as Verbal is being interrogated by Kujan. As the story becomes more complex we see Verbal becoming more arrogant and manipulative of Kujan. The character of Verbal becomes more and more interesting as the movie goes on. Kevin Spacey was the perfect actor to play the role of Verbal as Spacey does well in providing mystery.In respect to theme, this movie is similar to The Interview. The 1998 movie The Interview is also revolved around a man's drawn-out interrogation for crimes he may or may not have committed.One technique used in The Usual Suspects is the motif of an unreliable narrator. Verbal often skirts around the questions being asked during his interrogation. Another technique used is flashbacks. As Verbal is being interrogated throughout this film Verbal narrates through the flashbacks exactly what happened the night of the boat explosion. The fact that Verbal was an unreliable narrator, thus the flashback scenes being unreliable as well, ties back to the theme of pride and arrogance leading to betrayal and manipulation.The pride and arrogance all of the ""usual suspects"" portrayed throughout this film shows how easy it is to manipulate and betray people. This film was one a lot of people can relate to in general because we have all been manipulated/ have manipulated others at some point in our lives."
"Kevin Spacey is Roger Mint, a con artist who is interrogated by the police following a crime resulting in a fire and several deaths. Told by Spacey with a series of flashbacks, the audience must pay close attention to the complicated storyline.Spacey is at the top of his game as Roger and he is joined by Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Benicio del Toronto, and Chazz Palminteri as assorted criminals, all with colorful histories of their own.The Usual Suspects is impossible to describe in a review without giving too much away. The only advice I can give to fully enjoy this wonderful and sophisticated crime drama is to turn off the phone, put the lights out and sit back and concentrate and the payoff is well worth it."
"From the witty title to the execution of the plot, I am amazed and truly bewildered by this story's beautiful bait. After watching this, you will realize the value of thinking out-of-the box.I love each character, they all gave justice to their roles as 'felons'; Each surprised me with their wits and their weaknesses, too.If you want a beautiful bait, a forward-thinking suspense and thriller, count this movie in. The plot is brilliant so as the script, I had to re-watch it and see where did I miss. It is fast, it is witty and it will need a nanosecond speed-of-light mind to solve this puzzle. You will never get bored with this one I swear."
"This might be one of those films where all your buddies talking it up turns what would've been a solid experience into something of a let-down. A good enough crime saga with some great one- liners and several sharp twists and turns, it's not something I'd revere alongside the all-timers. I felt like there was too much reliance on name dropping and intentional complications, which I guess fits in with the big twist at the very end, but that doesn't suddenly make it excusable. Tough to follow at many times, with some interesting storytelling experiments along the way; it's a good-to-very good story that often gets too caught up in itself."
"When i heard about the movie people were saying stuff like ;""its the best movie I've ever seen"" or ""best movie of all time"", so of course i had to see it. But i was really disappointed. I just didn't get what was so awesome about it. I asked around a little, and apparently it was the twist in the end that made it ""the best movie ever"". That just doesn't make sense.Sure you go ""oh, he was the guy?"" in the end, but thats it. Other than that it wasn't ""the best"" in any way. The acting was average, the script and screenplay wasn't remarkable. All that fuzz was about the last couple of minutes of the movie.It was kind of entertaining, but still not close to the masterpiece people describe it as"
"I'm not much for writing reviews. But then again, there's not a lot of films where I go against popular opinion. The Usual Suspects is an exception.***SPOILER WARNING***The Usual Suspects is an exception because it lies. It lies because it presents itself as a clever mystery; as a riddle. Except riddles are solvable. Trying to solve The Usual Suspects is like trying to solve a jigsaw with lego pieces.Not counting final few moments, the film is actually good. It takes you into the final scenes with great anticipation. 'Finally', you say, 'the twist will be revealed, which will put everything into perspective.' The film doesn't do that. Instead, the twist leaves you with endless questions. It leaves you thinking, 'Why did any of that just happen?' Why does Verbal design an intricate plan to recruit four nobodies when he could just pay people? Why does he tell Kujan his story using phrases from the bulletin board, when he can easily be discovered?And to top it off, the final scene is almost as bad as the twist itself. Verbal gets away, but all too late. He's been found out. Two hours of lies for nothing.The Usual Suspects tries combine mystery and a clever twist and fails. Fails hard. The 'mystery' is nothing but lies, and the 'clever twist' is anything but clever.3/10"
"I first viewed The Usual Suspects a decade ago, lulled into the cinema by a plethora of pretentious critics and knowing smart alecs who claimed this was the most intelligent piece of film making in a generation. I left the cinema confused and devoid of any experience which could be mistaken for entertainment.THe Usual suspects starkly demonstrates all that is wrong with modern film making and their all too gullible audiences. I won't even begin to summarise the confusing plot if that is what you would care to call it. Fellow reviewers who try to do so are simply wasting their energy. Why bother to do so when it clearly makes no sense, has no structure,and is meaningless.Or perhaps writer and director McQuarrie and Singer have the guile of the tailors of the apocryphal emperors non existent clothes. They are probably laughing themselves senseless at the army of critics who hail this as great film making and the sheep like audience who teemed into movie theatres at their behest."
"This movie is nothing but a complete waste of time. There is absolutely no logic in the story, the characters are boring and everything is mixed together and that makes the movie very confusing and extremely boring.
Five stupid men are the main characters, and all they do is talk about stupid things in a boring way. Occasionally the director puts in a little stupid action which makes no particular sense.Overall: A very clumsy attempt to make a crime movie. And I'm sorry that it isn't possible to vote less than 1 for this movie failure. It's a disgrace to the whole movie industry.If you want to see a brilliant crime movie you should try ""Seven"" or ""The Silence Of The Lambs"". True classics!"
"The more one thinks about this film, the more outlandish it becomes.  To me, this film falls into the thriller/mystery trap.  Create a bunch of cool characters, throw in a lot of swearing (I guess it makes them seem tougher) and then create a story that keeps boxing itself into the corner and then at the end throw in a twist so audacious that the audience in amazement at the filmmaker's arrogance will capitulate.  Well, not me.  I can't believe one bit of it.  Bryan Singer gets a good performance from his cast, the exception being Kevin Pollak who comes across a someone desperately trying to show how tough he is even though he isn't.  The film looks slick and stylish but sadly the ending is just too unbelievable to let me recommend it."
"I have no problem with the movie as a form of entertainment, but to say that it is one of the top 250 movies and a brilliant thriller is taking it too far.  The plot is smart and well disguised, but the ending just reminded me of an episode of ""Murder, She Wrote"".  All you have to do is make sure everyone has a motive and then randomly pick on at the end.Maybe it's because I'd heard so many good reports about this movie that I found it so utterly ordinary, but when I logged on to find it has scored so highly I was totally flabbergasted.  I'm beginning to think that I might have missed something critical that everyone else has seen.  Doubt it, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion."
