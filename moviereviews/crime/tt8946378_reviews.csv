Reviews
"Nothing was typical about this. Everything was beautifully done in this movie, the story, the flow, the scenario, everything.
I highly recommend it for mystery lovers, for anyone who wants to watch a good movie!"
"What an excellent film by Rian Johnson; definitely feels like the film he was destined to make. Writing that is slick as hell, sublime performances (most notably Daniel Craig who brings his A-game in a wonderfully charismatic turn), superb editing and wonderfully atmospheric music - all tied together by masterful direction. Will probably be among the most fun you have at a theatre this year and fans of Agatha Christie and old murder mystery stories will have plenty to love here - a nostalgically entertaining time!"
"Best movie of the year, love everything about it, what I'm seeing is that some trolls that still can't get over TLJ, now for those that have and give it a 1 well that's fair but have some reasons why, not just bc it's Rian Johnson, like stop it's childish"
"As a fan of mysteries (Sherlock Holmes, Poirot, Columbo, Monk, Psych.etc.) I was thrilled to see someone making a classic style whodunnit...and the cast! Figure you can't go wrong. Well I enjoyed it & while the cast all have time to shine it is Daniel Craig with his Southern drawl & especially Ana de Armas that steal the show. For anyone keeping away because they hated The Last Jedi...I agree, it was my least favourite of all the Star Wars films, but this is a well written film that was well acted and I can only hope this will inspire others to reinvigorate the murder mystery genre."
"I enjoyed this a lot. Clever, interesting and plausible in its logic. I enjoyed the deception put forth by the characters. I can usually tell where something is going and was genuinely surprised by the hole in the hole of the donut.Some people might hate the politics of it, but I thought it gave a good dig at both sides while still being fairly liberal. FOX watchers will hate it, which I can see as kind of fueling the negative reviews.What can also fuel the negative reviews. is all the positive hype about it. Too much enthusiasm from the critics can hurt a movie sometimes. Viewers go into the theater expecting too much.Things never live up to the hype and this one didn't live up to it for me. But I thought it was still pretty solid and entertaining. I'm not sorry I spent some money on this one."
"I have read the many glowing reviews for this film and I honestly don't get it. Yes, there were some very funny and entertaining parts. It was a very good ensemble cast. Daneil Craig does his best Kevin Spacey as Frank Underwood impression. But beyond that, I found the cast woefully underused. Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson etc. I expected Jamie Lee to play a major role but she seemed more like window dressing. She also, as the daughter, appeared to have no real motive for the murder. So the real crime here was her underuse. 1/2 of the members of the family had no motive mentioned. Then, when the ""murder"" was revealed at the half way point, it was clear Martha did not really do it and was being set up. Chris Evans conveniently shows up at the halfway point with lines, so the reveal, for the most part is painfuly obvious, or at least most of it. The give-aways were pretty obvious, like granny saying ""Random, you're back AGAIN"" or the comment on how the dogs barked only with certain people. The mention of the ""slayer"" law was very, very obvious. I understand this is a parody of the sleuth genre but shouldn't there be at least some surprises?Nor do I believe this is a ""commentary"" on our situation today. Yes, there was a dialogue thrown in on immigration but nothing new was covered here.That is not to say it is a bad film. Daniel Craig and the cast seemed to be having a ball. Lots of kooky things happened. But I think this is better for a late-nite Netflix watch.I certainly don't see it as being ""best of the year."""
"This is a movie one would not regret spending money on. After a long time I am rating a movie perfect 10 and this movie totally deserves it. I really like the subtle comedy sprinkled in the movie. It easies out the tense atmosphere. In a good detective movie, you expect to be taken aback on how things unfold at the end and this is what happens in this movie. There is never an instant when you would get distracted or bored. I had a good time watching this movie and you would surely have it too."
"I actually wish  would do away with the star-rating portion of their website because it doesn't give an accurate rating for films and this film is a perfect example. Everyone knows that there are many bitter Star Wars fanboys rating this film low because they are still so bitter over Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi and as a result, they are going to try to ruin any of Rian's future films. They really need to just get over it and get a life, already. DON'T believe the Star-Rating of This Film Because It's Mostly from Bitter Star Wars Fanboys Rating the Film LOW ON PURPOSE!, obviously. Anyone who has actually seen this film would be brain-dead to rate it low or to not give it a good review because this film is so freaking entertaining! I could see it again and again. It's so different than the crap that has been in the theaters lately. It's fun, it's thrilling, it's wacky, it has so many twists and turns that it always keeps you guessing. And for the cast, what a freaking cast! I couldn't even tell you who the MVP of the cast was. They were all fantastic. We need more films like this and less big explosions, stupid plot films. I for one, will give this the true star-rating it deserves! 10/10!!!!! Bitter Star Wars fanboys, you can keep being immature and rating it low, but it isn't going to change the fact that the film is great and I'm going to encourage every single person to go out and see it pronto when it hits theaters!"
"Knives Out (2019)
8/10ðŸ—¡ðŸšªðŸ’‰ðŸ’¸""Rian Johnson successfully revives the ""whodunnit"" mystery subgenre with this perfectly cast fun time, even if it doesn't bring anything groundbreaking to the table.""Knives Out is the kind of ""whodunnit"" film that will never fail to entertain. As a progressive mystery, Knives Out is a very fashionable movie with it's grand ensemble of fresh and familiar faces. With some very snarky and slick writing, these characters are albeit memorable, most notably Daniel Craig's Detective Blanc and Chris Evan's Ransome, however, the film fails to make full use of the ensemble to the greatest extent. Of course that never takes away from what else Knives Out has to offer. The intensity of every moment that leaves you questioning the motive and action behind the titled crime scene is delivered with such glorious fashion, one could say Murder on the Orient Express had a beautiful baby, this being the result, showing Rian Johnson's strongholds. While the first two acts of the movie are quite strong and promising, the third act finds itself being a little rough around the edges but manages to find it's footing upon the conclusion; one for all and all for one.Verdict: Knives Out not only proves to us that Rian Johnson is a strong director with the right material, but also displays a fashionable reiteration of what the mystery genre can do to keep us guessing what is left in store for us to see in all the right ways."
Mildly entertaining with a great cast and high production value. The story is soft but not awful. I can't imagine saying this film deserves more than a 6.
Beautifully filmed and thought out very well which to me is good enough! Great ensemble cast that did excellent acting among adding hilarious parts in many scenes. Absolutely love Daniel Craig and Ana De Amas did awesome! I'm sure Knives Out has mixed opinions but I am very glad I got to see an early screening.
"Sometimes I am shocked when I see a great film...only to see it has an incredibly low overall score on IMDB. This is definitely the case with ""Knives Out""....a great film by writer/director Rian Johnson that I strongly recommend you see. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if this one receives some Oscar nominations...it's that good.""Knives Out"" is like an Agatha Christie novel set in modern day America and with American characters. But it's not just a homage to Christie-style films but a genuinely good and unique film in its own right. Kudos to many of the actors...particularly Daniel Craig. I thought Craig was miscast as a Southern American detective....but he carried it off wonderfully.Overall, I have no complaints...nothing I disliked or would do differently. In fact, it was so good I nearly gave it a 10....and I completely enjoyed the movie."
"I wish I had something good to say about this. A bland script, dull characters, a totally miscast Daniel Craig with an awful Southern accent and you are in for a painful night at the cinema. If you love murder mysteries / whodunnits, you need to avoid this. It can't even decide if it's trying to be fun or serious. In the end it's neither."
"A Stella cast carrying a whodunit will depend entirely on the story... Sadly, instead of ""the plot thickens"", it thins out unbearably...Overall the movie was entertaining enough to watch... But the plot was stretched a little thin and the ending was disappointing...A whodunit works by bringing the audience along to try to figure out the crime and be pleasantly surprised at the big reveal... This movie decided at the half way point that it no longer wants to be a whodunit and we no longer should follow along as it does its own thing... Sigh...I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who truly enjoy the genre..Spoiler Alert...Let's tackle the minor annoyances first...1) The beginning sets everyone out as having a motive to murder... Standard for the genre but here, it stops there...No building up of everyone/anyone who also had the opportunity to commit the murder... Motive without opportunity doesn't add up to murder...This means... Before the middle of the story, we have already eliminated almost everyone as the suspect... Which kinda defeats the whodunit plotline...2) Having a girl who is a witness who vomits if she lies is extremely convenient for a murder detective... And... Surely any investigator will target her for as much information as possible...Here however, to preserve the big reveal later I guess, they let her off without ever really questioning her...(even Ransom got more information than the investigators did...)In fact, the detectives were more interested in talking to Benoit and kept telling her to go away after finding out this rather beneficial condition...This leaves a feeling of a weak plot that cannot exclude her from some crucial events...She didn't have to witness the suicide... Which in itself didn't add anything to the story... And with that, she could spill the beans on what she did and we can all still believe there was further foul play involved...3) Marta and Benoit find the hidden tox report after spending hours to chase it down... Yet they can sit down to have a chat after finding it but neither even opened it to take a look?This gives us the scene where she was about to confess in front of the whole family but was stopped in mid sentence... Drama!!!!That's ridiculous and again feels forced/false...4) Walt confronts Marta at her home... He evades the horde of reporters and came in via the back way...Firstly, a rich guy like him would likely never have to use the back way and wouldn't be able to find one...Secondly, Walt is the 'boss' of a printing empire and it's unreasonable that nobody in the media recognises him...Thirdly, he walks/limps with a cane...Is he really the best person to go seek Marta out under the circumstance?
Wouldn't Meg, Donna or Jacob be better suited for the stealth-required mission?5) Captain frigging America... Emm, I mean Ransom... When he left and came back, wouldn't that be recorded in the early part of the surveillance video? He stopped exactly where she stopped...Ok, this one, maybe I can accept the reason is he knows the area well and was able to evade detection... Still unsatisfying though...6) Fran wants to confront Ransom believing he killed Harlan...a woman, confronting a man/killer even if he's not Captain America, surely wouldn't choose an abandoned/creepy location to meet..What does she think will happen? This is not a slasher flick where dumb teenagers go into the room despite multiple warnings not to...7) Harlan was in a terrible rush to kill himself...Marta explained that he will die in
10 minutes... And at around the 5 minutes mark, he will sweat profusely and have some other symptoms...Wouldn't a normal person wait until the symptoms start to show before reaching for the knife?
Many more minor niggles like Benoit not needing to introduce himself before sitting inside the house witnessing all the 'interrogations'... -There seem to be no other maids or servants in such a huge, well maintained house, that needed to be questioned... -Marta just happens to have a large magnet in her pocket for erasing a video tape... -Nobody who wasn't around needs to have an alibi for their whereabouts...-none of the other detectives see the blood stain on Marta's shoe...Too many roll eyes moments for a whodunit plot...Now...Let's get to the parts that killed the movie/story...1) Benoit doing his best Poirot... And gave too much details without any evidence...Examples...-He could simply say Ransom switched the medication.. But instead, he goes into details of how he sucked out medication from one bottle and then from the other bottle... How would he know that?-How did he deduce that it was Ransom who sent him the cash?-How can he be so sure that a person with dementia simply didn't mix up 'back' and 'back again'... Very thin even if we can accept the inference...If he's wrong at any point, Ransom could stop him and the story telling ends...These plus some other details he brought up without any evidence shows that he is just showboating and not very professional... He should be more mindful of his reputation... And this goes against his persona of being careful with what he says as shown in the beginning...2) the claim is that Ransom torched the examiners' office the night before... And yet in the morning light (actually around 9am already...) and the fire on that not-large building seem to just get going... In real life, it should be ashes before daylight... Unless it was touched an hour or two before 9am...Since Ransom was with Marta in the morning, he couldn't have done it...3) we were told that overdose of morphine means dying in 10 minutes...When Marta found Fran, Ransom was in police custody and there was nobody else around... She should be the prime suspect...And obviously, Ransom couldn't have done that too...4) in the scene where she makes her escape after the will reading...the family couldn't stop her if she wanted to drive away... Richard said something like, what do you want me to do, bite the bumper?(to stop her leaving...)... But when she came out of the car, push through the crowd to get into Ransom's car, not a single person stopped her getting in...This is of course essential for her to spend quality time with Ransom... Totally unrealistic...In conclusion...As said... Not bad entertainment (6-7) but a terrible whodunit (2-3)... So around 4.5 overall..."
"Saw this with a friend at an advance screening, so at least we didn't have to pay for it. This film felt like it was trying oh so hard to be ""fun"" and ""hip"" but ended up falling flat. The plot gets convoluted, and confusing at times. The device of having Ana de Armas' character vomit when she lies was pretty dumb. At two hours and 10 minutes, it's at least 45 minutes too long. It wasn't awful (if it was, we would've left), but left us both feeling ""meh."" It was fun watching the actors wolfing down the scenery, and so was not too unpleasant way of passing the time. But this isn't a movie I'd recommend to anyone."
"Knives Out is a great whodunit that's unpredictable and extremely funny, skillfully playing with the tropes and conventions of a murder mystery. All of it's incredible cast are excellent but Chris Evans, Daniel Craig and Ana De Armas give the standout performances. Rian Johnson's direction is great and the film is extremely well filmed. The music by Nathan Johnson is fantastic. However, it's brought down slightly by the second act which can be tedious at times."
"Generally speaking you tend to find more murder mystery TV shows than movies, this is partially since it's hard to build a complete mystery in the allotted movie running time.
This movie builds this murder beautifully by showing the different points of views of the suspects. It has a different take than other movies since it gives the viewer a little too much details mid-movie which leaves you questioning everything to the last minute.
The acting was brilliant and I didn't feel the number of characters was overdoing it at any stage."
It's a fun whodunit movie with a great cast. It would make a great book too.
"""Knives Out"" is a perfectly entertaining, perfectly agreeable little film, a star-studded old-style murder-mystery that's good fun while it lasts. The actors involved all seem to be having fun and the plot keeps you engaged, even right up to the reveal when you will, as can often happen with these things, find yourself saying, ""Oh, so that's...hang on, that doesn't make any sense"". For indeed, plot and motivation holes abound and ultimately you're left with a decent film (although some might find the lie/reflux plot point a trifle irritating). It's fun enough, the kind of film best watched after Christmas lunch with the family, but it's not a game-changer in any way."
"This isn't even a ""who dunnitt"" murder mystery. An old man commits suicide in plain view of the audience so we know right away ""who dunnit"". The rest of the movie consists of watching a hispanic nurse vomit every fifteen minutes while the victim's family do nothing but spew vulgarity at each other. Should've stayed home and played with my dog instead of wasting my time at this one."
"I was so hyped for this movie after seeing the star studded cast and the rave reviews online. A movie with Daniel Craig, Chris Evans and Jamie Lee Curtis, I couldn't ask for more. However, the pacing is slow and the ""big twist"" is quite underwhelming. The jokes fall flat and aren't done well, I was expecting some great thrilling mystery and bust out laughing jokes but it sadly was a dud."
Not sure how this film has managed to get anywhere near to an 8 - it is a very dull film that thinks it is cleverer than it actually is! Not a case of Whodunit but more like Whocares.
"After having seen all of Johnson's movies except for The Brothers Bloom I expected something a little bit more from Knives Out. A more mature, cold film with it's tounge in cheek is what I wanted after previously enjoying Brick and Looper so much. I was at least very happy to see it put a curious twist on the murder mystery genre. The story takes a very different path than I expected. Sadly, it seems as though they could have gone in harder with this twist, it goes back to the usual motions after a while.As it is this has to be Johnson's most accessible movie yet. It's a star-studded cast filled with old reliabales and also some newcomers. Though I don't feel as though the actors were given very much time to properly shine it's all very lovely and nice. The high saturation and crazy colorful sets should grab the interest of most viewers aswell, though I do find the cinematography quite formulaic.If you're looking for a nice family film you can take your children or parents to you're sure to have a blast. If you're looking for anything like Johnson's earlier work or something more artsy however, you'll be disappointed."
"The acting was excellent with a cast the worked well together. The plot was very good for a whodunnit with only a couple of holes. It is like someone gave them a good script and were then told to insert the Hollywood viewpoint. The script would have worked just as well without it. After the first fifteen minutes you know who the good guys are, who the bad guys are and basically how the movie is going to end all because of the politics that have needlessly put into the movie. Some scenes seem like they are cracking an egg with a sledge hammer If I want to listen to someones politics I will watch a political show or go to a political meeting or even a movie that is supposed to be political.I was really looking forward to seeing the movie and left hugely disappointed."
"What a waste of a stellar cast. The trailer shows almost all the scenes that the famous people are in together. The rest of the time you are watching a little known Cuban actress who is apparently the star of the movie. It's hard to believe that this is the same writer/director as Brick, which is one of my top 10 favorite movies. This movie doesn't have nearly as much sly humor as that movie. It's not particularly witty and it's not really a sendup of the genre, either. Not a complete waste of time, but not what I was hoping for either."
"This is the first time I've been compelled to write a review of a movie on IMDB. I was excited to go to this the day after Thanksgiving on the rare day off. When I say it was a real drag it's because the pacing was horrible absolutely boring at times you've been a somewhat strong finish couldn't help it, it was so predictable. A fine cast couldn't save it. Watch Murder on the Orient Express instead."
"This film clearly considers itself to be very clever (& classy).
It is at least fairly well mannered.
Clever? No.
A decent episode of Columbo or Poirot(Suchet) is far more satisfying.
I was glad when it finished. There's no depth to this. Kermode thinks it's a work of genius. It isn't. Was Daniel Craig impressive? No, not really.
Was anything else impressive? Not at all.
A decent cast which delivers almost nothing.
A work of no obvious merit that's totally overblown."
"The movie plays like the worst episode of COLUMBO you have ever seen, only this time it features Daniel Craig attempting to imitate Foghorn Leghorn. Learn from my mistake and avoid this turkey."
"As of writing this on 11/30/19, this movie has over an 8 rating....and that is just BAFFLING. It tries so hard to surprise and shock, yet none of the twists are surprising nor shocking. Movie's with over an 8 on IMDB are reserved for the upper echelon, the absolute best of the best. This, being generous, deserves a 6 out of 10 (I'd rank it at a 4 out of 10). The only reason I can see it getting more is because people want to see themselves as artsy and cinematic experts. It's a bland murder mystery with a good cast that is WAY too long and never delivers on any front."
"I believe Knives Out can be summarized as white America (Chris Evans Capt America) bad immigrant good.
The plot makes the point that family posterity should have less value than a possibly senile old man's grateful emotion for an immigrant nurse's kindness.
The movie is tedious and its attack on family despicable.
Ideally, family is love, security, comfort and sanctuary, but Knives Out mocks all that should be honored and protected."
Mildly interesting plot. Could not move pass the in-your-face political agenda
Some people love it some people don't. I don't. Found myself embarrassed for the actors and lack of writing.
"I really wanted to like this film. I love whodunit films, from Agatha Christie to Murder She Wrote, the intrigue and mystery of this sub-genre can be very interesting and entertaining in the right hands. Yet here, with this film, none of the intrigue or mystery is either interesting nor entertaining, and like the awful humour, misses its mark! I like puzzles that hint at me, not hit me over the nose, and 'Knives Out' is a poor man's murder mystery - a very easy 1 out of 10."
"Knives out has to be the shallowest stupidest movie ever made. They just want to ca$h in on holiday money. Terrible plot, bad acting, but what do you expect with a dumb whodunit."
Why in Gods good earth would you use an English actor to play the part of a southern version of Columbo!?!? It was horrible. It would have been a thousand times better to have Monk star in this movie. I couldn't wait for this movie to end. Holmes and Watson was more tolerable at least you knew going in it was a crap movie with half hearted attempt to act. Craig probably thinks he did a good job. Yuck.
"After seeing the trailer, the first thing you notice is the fantastic ensemble cast, but you might not expect this movie to be that comedic to be honest, more of a Thriller vibe. This movie decides to be a satire for the first 30mins, a silly comedy for the next 90mins and throws in some Thriller minutes for the fun of it, like playing Cluedo with Go-Stones, its a mess ad all over the place!This murder mystery ""reveals who the killer is"" halfway through the movie and still keeps on going, because it changes its premise after the first half, and now decides to be a different movie.All that being said... this movie is entertaining, for over 2 hours and reminds me how funny Daniel Craig can be. While the movie still suffers from the typical ensemble cast problems, it almost satirically plays with its own flaws and doesn't take itself to seriously.It's absolutely not a movie that you will remember in a few months, but its a light-harded comedy that will make you laugh a few times and that's what a comedy is about after all.I'm not sure if this is a movie you have to experience in the cinema, but it will be the perfect movie for a lazy rainy Sunday once it hits the streaming services!"
"Knives Out (4.5 out of 5 stars).Knives Out is a mystery murder crime film which you will have a lot of fun with this Clue like concept as Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) tries to solve a murder. This kind of film reminds me like Murder at the Orient Express. But a little more fun and entertaining. Rian Johnson direction and his witty script makes this movie worth watching. It is fun, there are surprises, and twist and turns.The plot follows Harlan (Christopher Plummer) who is a patriarch and owns a lot. After he was mysteriously found dead and presumed it was a suicide. A private investigator Benoit Blanc is hired to solve the mystery. With the family being on the will and are wanting their share of Harlan's property and company. Blanc believes there is a suspect that is at large within the family.The film's plot is a little slow moving. It is a lot of fun. Blanc interviewing every family member Ranson (Chris Evans) who is the black sheep of the family. Linda (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her husband Richard (Don Johnson). Walt (Michael Shannon). Meg (Katherine Langford). Jacob (Jaeden Martell). Joni (Toni Collette). And their house nanny Marta (Ana de Armas). The cast ensemble was great. The performances are fun and entertaining.The film is filled with surprises with twist and turns. Definitely best seeing without reading or looking up spoilers about it. I would love to see another movie of this.Overall, Knives Out is a really good film. If you are into the murder mystery kind of movie. This would be it."
"A pretty bland whodunit that think's it's more intelligent than it is. A good whodunit needs a twist, or a surprise at the end, this had neither, the person you presume is the bad guy at the beginning is the bad guy at the end. In the films defence, the cast are all excellent"
"I say it's nothing special and I'm not a Star Wars fanatic. I've never even seen the film people are so angry about, so my review is based purely on my experience of watching this film, Knives Out.I definitely expected more. If it's meant to be amusing, it pretty much failed on that score. This film would be better suited as a TV movie, if they even make them anymore, or something to pop up on Netflix. I didn't pay to see it and I'd feel I'd wasted my money if I had.Visually it was enjoyable-I mean the location, the house, the production values. the family members were an unattractive bunch, so nothing to look at there. Daniel Craig's ""southern"" accent became grating after awhile, and I was squirming a bit with boredom, waiting for it to be over. And, when it was, my reaction was ""So what? Who cares?"" I can hardly remember any of it and I just watched it in the last couple of hours.Convoluted, unrealistic and tedious, like a lot of Agatha Christie stories. How this has ended up on some people's Best Films of 2019 lists is beyond me. It was okay; nothing special."
I thought it would be a witty dark mystery about Daniel Graig as a PI who solves a murder mystery in a mansion. But was wrong. The film has almost no mystery. Much of it takes place outside of the mansion. It focuses almost entirely on a hispanic maid in order to make a painfully obvious political statement about how entitled white people mistreat immigrants. That's it. That's the whole film. There aren't reversals more than props planted and then hinted at later. Plot convenience and terrible writing. The film doesn't even make sense. This felt like a bad draft. My head hurts now.
"I love who done it movies, but this one bored me. Daniel Craig had no presence and his fake southern accent was insulting.Not worth bothering with. I wonder how many of the 10 star reviews are from the people that worked on the movie."
A Moderate Paced Setup Turns Into a wonderfully woven tale of intrigue and mystery. I enjoyed every minute of it. It was suspenseful and well played. Two thumbs up.
"Overacting, poor script and an end you can predict from minute 1. What a waste of time. Daniel Craig should be al ashamed."
"There's no point in labeling a movie as a murder mystery when there is literally no murder...or mystery. We find out what happened near the beginning of the movie and for the rest of it just follow some random character. It's boring, lazy and sloppy and just proves that Rian Johnson needs to take a break from directing for some time"
"2019 has blessed movie fans with an impressively strong finish to the year in film. Among the excellent movies released in the past few months, ""Knives Out"" is perhaps the most purely entertaining. The star-studded cast pairing with a virtuoso director of consistently compelling movies served as powerful ingredients in the recipe for an entertaining movie, and the dish was prepared to perfection.Despite what a few angry Star Wars fanboys will tell you about Rian Johnson and his sacrilegious creation, ""The Last Jedi"" Johnson is one of the better writer/directors in Hollywood. In my humble opinion, Johnson's Star Wars movie is perhaps the best in the saga.Nevertheless, Johnson's latest romp should please all audiences. This film boasts one of the most impressive casts in recent memory, each member of which plays against type in a delightfully over-the-top fashion. Leading the pack is Daniel Craig (James Bond himself) playing a brilliant investigator named Benoit Blanc and flashing the same accent he would if he became the new KFC Colonel in the latest commercial. Yes, his southern drawl is comically exaggerated, but that is completely intentional. Many the best lines in the movie come with an implied wink at the camera, letting us know that everyone is in on the joke. Even Chris Evans (the beloved Captain America and the perhaps more beloved Twitter voice of good) plays a loathsome spoiled child of an entitled upbringing, who ruthlessly insults his family and hates dogs. I'll let you decide which of those traits is worse.As a whodunnit, the movie is effective in ways you might not see coming and in plenty of ways you will. Even though the events leading to the death are revealed 40 minutes into the movie, Johnson manages to subvert expectations and remain steps ahead of viewers until the very end. I dare you to guess every twist and solve the puzzle before Blanc. The character often looks to be underwhelming as a detective, but that is also intentional. He eventually reveals himself to be multiple steps ahead the entire time.Raw humor, suspense, and caustic social commentary combine to elicit one of the best screenplays of the year, one that deserves serious Oscar consideration. When the dust settles and mystery has been solved, the end result is a charming and satisfying mystery/comedy. We all deserve more movies like this, and we can thank Johnson for giving us one."
"Why defenders of this film can't understand simple fact: people JUST get tired from unnecessary POLITICS in EVERY mediocre entertaining film. And this guy have his 1/10 not for Last Jedi, but for this cheap political pamphlet with direct offense to American majority, like we don't have already infamous Red Hollywood, and now they go again. I am from country with socialistic regime and this rhetorics will lead only to oppression of some classes. And then! I am telling this about that detective movie? YES! Its real shame that in 2019 we can't go to movie theater and don't get bunch of political statements in our faces. Maybe ratings of this film make them producers think that short-term cash-grab on liberal zoomers is really short-term. Or maybe we will get somedays some MPAA film rating system that include POLITICS in film and get for that R. Because they deserve it for propaganda to the children. Maybe I see the day when all Disney fosterling get their R-rating for propaganda and strong political themes."
"I love mystery stories. I adore Daniel Craig. The writer of this mess, not so much. Don't understand why it is so overrated. Ooohh, big surprise ending. By the time he gets around to it, don't much care. Why bother to make Craig assume the bad accent as it adds absolutely nothing to the plot or character. I've read so many better books, why not make movies out of them. Read Nesbo, see Headhunters. Now That has plot twists."
"This movie was boring and predictable. Clue is worth watching, this is not. Jokes did not land. I am baffled by the high reviews. Save your money, this is a movie to wait to watch for free if you are looking to pass a few hours. Highly over rated, definitely over hyped."
"Others have mentioned the old house might have held some secrets (it didn't). Or that it might present a more structured ""Whodunit"" that leaves you guessing (it didn't). Or that the main character might offer a bit of verve, cleverness or pizazz, that might have livened up the whole affair (she doesn't, at all).I also take some issue with the director's choices in scene framing, especially in the beginning. There should have been more close-ups, and better initial intros for each character's little idiosyncrasies so we would could warm up to them. I simply don't care for how it was shot; it's terribly pedestrian. The fast, quick edits of the trailer are totally absent! There's something missing here. Todd Solondz, Tim Burton or the Cohen Brothers really could have drawn these characters out more and given the actors something real to work with.I thought it would sparkle with a bit more witty, dark humor. It wasn't quite as funny or snappy as I was expecting it to be. Instead, it settles on delivering more of a ""message"" about this girl, who does good, while the others do bad.There's also no need for Daniel Craig's poor Southern accent. He should have just done a British accent, it would have been fine and enjoyable, maybe given the film a bit more weight it seems it was shooting for, in the end, with its messaging.Additional viewings might reveal there's more to it, but I suspect such might reveal there's less."
"Hugely overrated. Great respect to Dan Craig, but he was completely miscast, and his accent is embarrassing. And then there's the plot. Erm... Why would Harlan kill himself 'knowing' the post-mortem' would indict Marta? And why not wait until some signs of the assumed morphine OD kick in. And who kills themselves by slitting their throat? And then there's the two redundant cops who don't have a problem with Blanc doing their job for them, who further overcrowd an already overcrowded 'stage'."
"I don't who is giving this film bad ratings, because it is everything you would want in a murder-mystery thriller. It takes a genre that has been done a million times and adds something new. Rian Johnson's script is sharp, witty, and at times heartbreaking. Go see this film! It is worth it!"
"Short and sweet, I feel this film suffers from an identity crisis. Is it a comedy? Not enough even half funny moments. Is it a murder mystery? The spider didn't do it. Is it a thriller? It had the tension of a soap bubble. Is it fast paced? It helps to have nano naps. Now I will only see James Bond as CSI KFC and Captain America as a smug murderer. Three of us walked out of the cinema feeling conned. Not a classic."
"The first 30 minutes of this movie were really, really good. The cinematography is gorgeous, the dialogue snappy, the editing engaging. But it all fell apart once the first twist is revealed and Rian Johnson starts getting self indulgent.I really don't like that he likes to have meta lines about how stupid his writing decisions are as if that justifies them. For example, we get the most borning car chase in cinema and when it's over one character says ""that has to be the dumbest car chase I've ever seen"". Seriously, I'm not even kidding. The detective sounds like a Foghorn Leghorn parody and they point it out at the end of the movie as if that makes it any less ridiculous! The writing gets flat out stupid at times because Rian Johnson is a moron. There's a scene where the detective claims that the case is like a doughnut with a hole that needs to be filled by a doughnut hole. No, I'm not kidding. Rian Johnson is this stupid! Our lead character can't lie or else she vomits uncontrollably. No, that's not from a Simpson's episode, it's from the latest Rian Johnson picture.I was at a sold out showing and more people clapped at the end of the Dora the Explorer movie! Sorry, this was yet another messy Rian Johnson script filled with too many characters and random plot developments."
What a waste of a stellar cast. The trailer shows almost all the scenes that the famous people are in together. The rest of the time you are watching a little known Cuban actress who is apparently the star of the movie. Yes I hated TLJ but I honestly hated this as well. Because the waste of talent of the cast a 1-star rating for me.
Go rent or stream clue and save yourself a few dollars
"The shills are out in force for this , frankly forgettable, movie. There seems to be a constant stream of 10/10 reviews which read as though the poster hasn't even seen the film.
The film looks good but the plot and character motivations don't make much sense in the face of anything other than casual scrutiny.
That said I did enjoy the first act. If the rest of the film had continued in that tone it would have undoubtedly earned a higher score for me.
The second act is very pedestrian and drags,but the film falls apart in the denouement.
Has zero rewatch potential. Wait for it on TV or streaming."
"Complete tosh. What does it tell you when the audience is praying for the film to end so we can all go home.
What idiot gave this the green light I'll never know.
Daniel Craig will be mortified when he looks back on this. His best friend must bite the bullet and tell him man to man that he's made a fool of himself. His Fohorn Leghorn accent is just cringing.
Dear film buffs save your money."
"Saw this at the festival circuit and was left completely unimpressed. An all star cast like this is usually a red flag for me that the story is going to be weak and I wasn't surprised. The Dialogue and characters are all super pretentious, and don't speak like real people so it's hard to care at all what happens. The twists feel cheap and unearned and sometimes it feels like things that are setup are never paid off in satisfying ways. Overall, AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS! Major Pass!"
"Sorry, not for me. Was really hoping to enjoy this. But, similar to the last highly rated whodunnit, Murder on the Orient Express, I was left feeling somewhat underwhelmed and, dare I say it, bored. Give me Lieutenant Columbo anytime over this."
"I have never seen any Star Wars films and have no knowledge of this director. I went to see it because of the starry cast and a good review in The Observer, a UK paper I respect. Also, I like country house whodunnit stories.
This was however a big disappointment. The warring family were uniformly horrible; I suppose they were meant to be, but they portrayed it so well that it was just unpleasant to watch. Daniel Craig has been an excellent Bond (and earlier, very good as Francis Bacon's lover), but here he was just awkward and his accent pretty ridiculous.
There was plenty of humour, which was OK at times, but overall that just meant that the film didn't seem to know whether it was a comedy or a serious story.
The worst bit was the long final denouement part, which was incredibly verbose and convoluted. I wasn't left feeling sad, happy, satisfied, intrigued or even angry - just flat. Avoid this film."
"You can see this movie as a movie about Hollywood, American ""celebrities"" and, in general, people in entertainment industry. About privileged, spoiled, arrogant, vile, semi-educated, ignorant, selfish, idiotic creatures and how they see and treat ordinary, decent, hard-working people ""below"" them. If that's positive, then that is the only positive thing I could find in this film.
I'm not even American and still I am so sick and tired of political propaganda in Hollywood movies (and honestly disgusted because I have first-hand experience with those ""good"" left-wing politics, but seems like war is good when lefties do it!).
I never expected anything remotely deep, even clever, insightful or at least pretty in Hollywood movies, those people are simply not capable of making Art. What we HAD from them was fun, entertainment and trash (in a good way). Now, we don't even have that. It's like some disease, those people just can't help it, they just can't keep their poisonous propaganda out of it. The belief of this black and white world that exists in the shallow minds of these entertainment people is so bizarre, considering they DO find themselves morally and intellectually superior to people who doesn't think like they do. And, besides that, they deliver us things like this... year after year.
Like I said - nothing but a trivial, banal story and brain diarrhea.
There is not an inch of comedy in this... creation. There is, however, a mystery... well, if you have very low standards. If you want true mystery watch ""Sherlock Holmes"" with Jeremy Brett or ""Poirot"" with David Suchet (or read books)."
"Gee, do I really need to watch a mystery movie to hear that immigrants are good and alt-right people are Nazis? Give me a break. Maybe writer/director Rian Johnson was trying to give some cultural context to the picture, but unfortunately the culture he is reflecting is his Kalifornia leftist echo chamber.
Aside from the distractive injection of immigration open borders advocacy, the film is a competent ensemble mystery comedy, easy on the comedy. In fact, if you aren't really looking for it, you may miss the humor, it is so innocuous and low-key, pretty much reflecting the state of comedy in America these days. Mustn't offend anybody with our humor, except of course rich white conservatives, who have no feelings, being pure evil.
The identity of the killer (who is of course rich and white) is kept well hidden for 95% of the running time, and for that, I give Knives Out 5 stars. It would have merited perhaps 7 stars, had Rian Johnson taken a few more chances in the comedy department, and withheld his dopey open immigration politics."
"Knives Out is a new crime drama directed, written and partly produced by Rian Johnson, the director of Looper and Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi.In the film, the successful crime novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is found dead on his estate. Harlan recently had his 85th birthday which makes all the guests of his birthday party a suspect of the murder. Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is now trying to investigate what happened and who is responsible for the death of Harlan Thrombey.This film is a new murder mystery film such as the 1985 film Clue, the film version of the board game Cluedo. As a viewer you try to discover together with the detective who is responsible for the death of the murdered character. Unfortunately, as a viewer you get more information about the murder mystery at a time than the characters in the film itself. So as a viewer you already know a little more than the characters and you can start to get ahead of the story. Rian Johnson tries to confuse you as a viewer with astray. Many of these traces are unfortunately not appropriately or clearly brought forward in the film, which means that final disclosures may seem somewhat unclear. Because of this lack of clarity, the film comes across as somewhat lengthy. With the film they try to explain everything to the viewers at the end, but this goes against the self-examination for which fans of murder mystery films watch such films.The cast of this film consists of many great actors and actresses such as Daniel Craig, Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson and Christopher Plummer. Daniel Craig uses a separate accent in the film all the time, which sometimes makes him look more comical than really as a serious detective. Of the cast, Ana de Armas comes out best in the film as the maid of the deceased. As maids, she plays a major role in gathering information about the murder mystery, because she knows all the family members and worked for them. Furthermore, Michael Shannon manages to provide a few comic moments in the film as the youngest son of the deceased."
"You can't go to the movies anymore. Everything is just junk propaganda.In this one, the migrant inherits everything, because has a kind heart and from a higher stage is going to cast judgement upon the unworthy, wasteful.
The End."
"This movie has arguably the worst writing I've ever experienced. I was incredibly excited to see it for months. I tried to stay away from excessively watching trailers or reviews to come in with as little of an expectation as I could. Which for me was hard. I adore the entire cast, I have thoroughly enjoyed some of Rian Johnson's earlier work (Star Wars excluded), and I got caught up in the nostalgia of a thrilling ""whodunnit"". Upon seeing it, I was very quickly shocked by the lack of originality, the completely cheesy dialogue, and a horrendous and obvious plot. I have never walked out of a theater in my life but this is the closest that I've ever come. I openly laughed at how bad the dialogue and plot points were. The entire theater was silent except to grimace. Don't waste your time or your hopes."
"I would rather have played clue that watch this as it was slow and in the end lacked a plausible payoff, ugh."
"The story itself isn't too bad, but not that big of a twist.But, why is there yet again a need by a director to try and indoctrinate the viewer with left wing propaganda?
Having digs at family and heritage while supporting and showing illegal immigrants to all be lovely and friendly.Stop ruining our films! It was not required at all and added nothing to the story. So many chances for classic films to of taken there place in film history but have missed out due to this unnecessary bias!"
"So, this is a bad remake of Clue... but...""The bad scores are because of Star Wars fans"" And, honestly I am sure that some of them are... but once more we see people attacking anyone that doesn't give a Rain Johnson 10 out of 10.""The bad scores are conservative trolls"" And once again we see people, and Johnson, attacking anyone that doesn't like this film.Once again people are throwing a fit because other people don't like the exact same thing they do.But to be honest, again, I can see that. This is overtly political, and by ""overtly"" I mean that they are screaming through a megaphone, at just about every opportunity, to inject their politics into it.Other than that, it is kind of like Clue... if Clue was very careful not to insult some people in their jokes, and very focused in an attempt to insult others with a sheer and unadulterated prejudice. And that kind of makes for a very awkward film where the jokes are so self-aware they can't help but fail.So, basically that is what you are getting, Clue with jokes aimed at the politically correct and a hearty injection of politics. And that is all you are getting.But, hey, if you haven't seen Clue, you might like it. And, if you share the politics and think they should be shrieked in everything, you will totally like it.The rest of us are just going to watch Clue."
"UnderratedI disliked TLJ as a SW movie and particularly disliked some of the comments made by Rian Johnson; I therefore completely understand why people are annoyed with him. However giving fictional ratings to a completely different project is just childish.There is no way this movie is worth only one star, I give it 5 stars because the acting for the most part was decent and the overall story was fine, as was the cinematography, editing, directing, etc.OverratedThere is no way this movie is perfect and giving it a positive fictional rating is just as childish.To be honest, I became bored during the first half of the movie, the second half picked up somewhat. I expected more from the cast, none of them got me emotionally involved, I was happy enough to find out how it all played out but didn't find myself caring whether any of them did it or didn't do it or were ultimately 'good' or 'bad'.Red FlagI should know by now that when a trailer has to quote critics about how funny it is then it probably isn't. I laughed out loud once during the movie and was elsewhere amused literally only once or twice. I certainly did not get the humor that everyone 'talks' about.Go see it if you like this kind of movie and judge it on it's own merits...please."
"The most unfortunate thing about this film is that it is not so much of a turkey that you don't flounce out of the cinema half way through like you ought to. Daniel Craig is seriously miscast as the all-knowing and complicit detective. How, ffs, are we to take this piece that mixes outright ridiculous scenarios - e.g. a privately employed PI telling the real law what to do, when etc. We have caricature cardboard cutouts of murder-mystery stereotypes, dreadful script and extremely poor plotting. We are left looking at all the gewgaws and other props that don't seem to have any significance or interest value to the characters. Two giant eyeballs on sticks, for example? We have the servant good, employer bad shtick given the modern racist wash but we've had enough of that laundry. Frankly, the whole enterprise is a bore-a-thon. If it was supposed to be funny, that went right over my head. Jokes normally make me laugh. This joke of a film left me dozing."
"I read through a lot of user reviews after seeing this today because I couldn't believe the high rating which is why I saw it in the first place. Seems like a lot of people don't like the director because of a Star Wars film he made. Well I'm not a fan of Star Wars and I can tell you the only thing this movie has going for it is a somewhat enjoyable first 20 minutes plus it seemed pretty to look at. That's all. My 10 year old daughter could have written better dialogue than this. I could see the guy sitting next to me getting very agitated about half way through so I asked him is he ok. He said to me
""What the hell is this I'm watching,""
I am not sure I would even recommend this for streaming considering how much good content there is out there."
"Probably the best film I have seen this year and one of the most memorable theatrical experiences I have ever had seeing it at its world premiere at TIFF. Thanks to the success of his previous studio film, The Last Jedi, Johnson gets to create a passion project that is so desperately needs to be seen in theatres.Johnson shows his love for the murder mystery genre but avoids falling into its predictable plot mechanics. The opening of Knives Out sets the table of what you would expect from this kind of premise on paper. The death of the celebrity author Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) brings in all the family members seeking the opportunity to selfishly claim his inheritance and the strange circumstances of his passing calls in private investigator Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) to solve the case. But once most of the character archetypes are established within the first act, Johnson allows his originality as a filmmaker to take over. From they're the perspectives shift and the twists elevate the story in a direction that is refreshing and surprisingly really funny. The humor becomes unrelenting and infectious, as everyone in the theatre could not hold back the laughter, with Johnson playing on genre's tropes and being meta about it.Johnson lets each of the cast members have fun and stand apart from one another with each playing really dynamic and complex character he has written. Chris Evans just relishes in playing the ruthless and yet complex grandson Ransom and doesn't hold back on spitting insults to anyone including his own family members. Michael Shannon plays a role slightly less antagonistic and more pathetic as youngest son Walt who gets no respect from his family. Jamie Lee Curtis continues to be a force of charisma to watch as the eldest daughter Linda. Even smaller but no less significant roles like Noah Segan and Lakieth Stanfield are also worth calling out.While Daniel Craig may get top-billing in the poster, the movie completely rest on Ana De Armas to carry the story and serve as the audience's perspective into this world. As Harlan's nurse Marta, she shows how isolated and alone she feels with the rest of Thrombley family despite they pretend to have her best interest. But as the plot progresses, De Armas gets to show range including some unexpected comedic moments and becomes more of a pivotal role in the mystery.
Daniel Craig gives full commitment to his over-the-top character. Craig as Blanc gets some of the best and most hysterical lines as he spout bizarre and confusing analogies in a super-thick Southern accent. He strikes a good balance of intelligence and hysterical as a man who is very perceptive of people's intention but also being really exaggerated and ridiculous in a good way.Similar to what he did with the Star Wars franchise in the Last Jedi, Johnson brings in social political commentary into a very old and tired genre to make if feel relevant. In this case, he uses the Thrombey family dynamic to tackle issues on the wealth of the 1%, immigration and self-entitled privilege. In the opening interview, Harlan's adult kids and in-laws all say they believe that each of their successful careers come from hard work despite flashbacks reveal they leech off of Harlan's own self-earned wealth and celebrity name. And with Marta coming from an immigrant family and being Harlan's personal nurse, the Thrombey's keep acknowledging subtly and (unsubtly in a heated family argument about politics) her lower status in society to boost their ego even they think it comes from a sense of sympathy. The oblivious nature and lack of wokeness most of the family retains (particularly with Don Johnson's and Toni Collete's characters) shows how much they have been too sheltered in their own rich bubble that creates a lot of great satirical humour.Regardless if you liked or disliked The Last Jedi, are fan of Rian Johnson in general as a filmmaker or just love the murder-mysteries in film, Knives Out is a big crowd pleaser that uses its huge big name cast to full efficiency. Just when you think you have the plot figured out, it adds twists upon twists that don't dragged down the story but elevate. Once it comes out in nation-wide theatres, see it as soon as you can."
"Knives out uses a really old idea, the ""whodunit"". Unfortunately, contrary to what many claim, there is not much here that makes it particular different or modern, except some hipster dialogue and humor (including a lot of throwing up by a specific character) and some commentary on current social issues, like the immigrant crisis, and pointing fingers at the ultra-rich, which is ironic because the writer/director of this movie is by now a multimillionaire and one of the highest paid directors in Hollywood. The writing is full of supposedly smart dialogue and ideas. In reality there not much cleverness here, while it constantly feels like the movie is trying too hard, and comes across as very pretentious and smugish. Most of the humor falls completely flat, it is overlong (130 minutes), twists are not surprising and don't really make sense. Only bright spots, Daniel Craig's amusing performance and the very talented Ana de Armas. Other than that, a semi-entertaining, mediocre and ultimate forgettable film. A perfect example of an uninspired writer/director, with a complete lack of originality, who uses a boring overused premise and accomplishes nothing new or interesting in the least.Personally I don't know much about Star Wars as I don't really follow pop-corn franchises, so I don't know what's going on with this director and Star Wars. However, it is very puzzling seeing this mediocre film which basically takes place in a house, getting so much marketing hype and buzz, while Hollywood seems to be in love with this movie and its' director. Looking around the internet for reviews and ratings one would think this is a serious Oscar contender for multiple awards, while some people are calling it the best movie of the year and calling out trolls (?) etc. I'm confused."
"What could have been a good movie is ruined by the political nonsense. The trailers don't show you this, but it influences the movie in a big way to the point of being incredibly preachy and annoying like Terminator Dark Fate. If this bothers you, don't see it."
"There are a few moments in Rian Johnson's Knives Out that feel well written. Most of this clunky script, however, is not.From the lazy 'lying makes me gag' plot device, the completely flawless protagonist, the unnecessary Leftist political undertones... Knives Out is a bit of a mess.It takes too long to get going, and reveals far too much, too early on. There's a reason crime thriller conventions exist, and that's because they work. Rian Johnson seems to believe he is above such conventions, so it is no surprise when after 45 minutes or so, the film starts to fall apart after Marta is revealed as the ""killer"".Some have said this is a parody of the whodunnit genre, but there is only so far that excuse can wash. With plot holes galore (Harlan thought of that intricate plan for Marta in the space of 10 minutes?), and an abundance of 'far too convenient' explanations, as a viewer I stopped caring about who did what.It doesn't help that Marta is a one-dimensional character (basically a personification of Johnson's politics) who I couldn't root for. Actually, I was actively hoping she'd be killed. I'm sorry, she was annoying.Overrated and complete with a completely obvious finale/""reveal"" (I feel a bit cheated with that ending, Ransom was so obviously culpable from his introduction), you can't help but feel this film thinks it's way cleverer than it actually is."
