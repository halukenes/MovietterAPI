"This movie undid something inside of me. It's that part of you that holds on to hope that people can be good, that there is hope for humanity. I knew the basics of it when I went to watch it: that it is about investigative reporters looking into a story of abuse in the catholic church. And it uncovered so much more than just that. Honestly, this movie should be seen by anyone who seeks the true face of the world. We don't live in a pink bubble of happiness. F*cked up things happen to people all the time; worst thing is when it happens to the innocent. The little ones who can't protect themselves. When they are robbed of their faith and their hope and their future. Sitting in the film theatre on the last row, I was brought to tears as in front of me a long list of places where victims spoke out was scrolling. I was both shocked and mad. I felt sorry that people can fail so miserably. ""Mike Rezendes: They knew and they let it happen! It could've been you, it could've been me, it could've been any of us."" Indeed. When we witness darkness and we shut up and we don't do anything about it, that's when we fail. A poet once wrote, ""You can join the millions talking in the dark. Or you can stand up and scream light, out into the night."" So choose to stand up. In your profession choose to eradicate the oblivion of evil. This movie is a masterpiece. From the dedication of the actors to their roles, to the script, the director and the cinematography. The score? Fantastic. Howard Shore did it again!"
"I've rated almost a hundred movies and I've only ever given out six 10s on this website. I don't rave about many movies and I am tough to please when it comes to film, but this film is absolute brilliance. It is flawless. This one earns its 10 and it is one of the best films I have ever seen. Everything about this film is brilliant. The camera work is great and the score is underrated. However, what makes this film is an absolutely genius screenplay that is acted to perfection. This script will rock your world. I am not Catholic. I didn't grow up in a deeply Catholic area, but this film still affected me greatly. Everyone should see this movie for that reason. That is something that you have to see for yourself. However, I'd like to focus a little more on the technical aspects. Beyond the fact that the subject matter is heavy and extremely important to American and world culture, this movie does everything else right. The acting is absolutely phenomenal. This is particularly true for Ruffalo and McAdams. I adore the subtlety with which they both act. It is brilliant. There isn't much more to say. This film is pure brilliance from its opening frame to its closing moment. For both cinematic and cultural reasons, this is a film that every person should see."
"Going into the theater to see Spotlight, I had read the rave reviews and knew I was in for something special. This movie did not disappoint! Being from Boston, this movie really made me think about my life growing up, as a lot of ""what ifs"" came to mind. ""What if"" I went to church every Sunday...""what if"" I was gullible enough to have a priest lure me into his lair. Spotlight goes straight to the heart of this amazingly sad (and apparently never-ending) saga of the Catholic church and the amount of abuse priests have inflicted on hundreds of victims. The acting is all-around fantastic, from Mr. Keaton to some actors that I am not familiar with, which is an aspect of this fine movie that makes it so profound. Tense throughout, I was saddened to hear that this abuse is an epidemic and probably will never be stopped. The exclamation point was when a member of the audience stood up and told the rest of us ""...I am a survivor..."" WOW..."
"Relevant, powerful and astonishing. Shocking, criminal and true. These are the only words to describe this film as it has literally put the 'spotlight' on the systematic cover-up by the Catholic Church of mass molestation and sexual assault acts performed by the priests in the Boston archdiocese that were trusted in the communities they represented. These 'men of God' preyed on the weak and vulnerable for years and the most powerful religious sect in the world did nothing but sweep it under the proverbial carpet. 'Spotlight's' dramatic importance has immediately drawn the attention of film lovers who crave a riveting production that dives deep into a very real circumstance that has impacted every corner of the globe.Tom McCarthy could not have been at the helm of a better film and what he has been able to achieve in terms of wrestling the attentions of the audience is worthy of the highest praise. McCarthy, along with Josh Singer have written a gritty story that pulls no punches and it isn't afraid to get right into the heart of the required subject. For 'Spotlight' to have been received by the critics as well as it has it had to stride unapologetically into this unbelievable and sordid affair. It needed to expose the sensitive and controversial information that some people may find confronting but in the context of this outstanding production, absolutely essential. It destroyed lives and revealed the blatant arrogance of this pious organisation.The all star cast jumps right out at you even before the opening scenes are shot up onto the screen. Based on true events, 'Spotlight' pushes all the right buttons from the beginning. As the name implies, 'Spotlight' refers to the investigative journalism team who report for the Boston Globe newspaper. They are thorough, relentless and will stop at nothing to expose headline stories that affect the everyday lives of normal American's. When the new editor, Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber), drops a potentially explosive story in the lap of Spotlight chief, Walter Robinson (Michael Keaton), about allegations of sexual abuse involving the Catholic Church, Robinson and his loyal crew go about uncovering one of the greatest criminal cover-ups in human history. The deeper their investigation goes the more sadistic and shocking the outcome becomes. Fingers are pointed, people are accused and the list of clergy involved becomes larger and larger. The whole situation ceases to become a Boston problem and grows to a worldwide exposure. Rachel McAdams and Mark Ruffalo are part of the investigative team as young committed journalists Sacha Pfeiffer and Mike Rezendes respectively. McAdams performance is award worthy and Ruffalo is fully engaged in a role that matches his talents. Michael Keaton has found his niche in Hollywood as a sort after mentor showcasing another strong performance as the tenacious and hard hitting Robinson. The real 'cherry' in the cast is the presence of the magnificent Stanley Tucci as Mitchell Garabedian who represents the victims in the whole saga. Tucci adds the class that takes 'Spotlight' to another level with an engrossingly accomplished performance.This is the best journalistic drama since 1976's 'All the President's Men'. Tom McCarthy has centred his narrative within the confines of the Boston Globe's newsroom as it should have been. 'Spotlight' doesn't shy away from the true nature of newspaper drama and the audience benefits from such an authentic setting. Top shelf acting from some of the very best young talent sparks the fire that captivates the viewer. Throw in some true icons in Keaton and Tucci and 'Spotlight' has the perfect balance. This film will be classified as the very best in its category and has set a benchmark in terms of confronting realism. Sit back and enjoy."
"Spotlight is a 2015 American biographical drama film directed by Tom McCarthy and written by McCarthy and Josh Singer. The film follows The Boston Globe's ""Spotlight"" team, the oldest continuously operating newspaper investigative unit in the United States, and its investigation into cases of widespread and systemic child sex abuse in the Boston area by numerous Roman Catholic priests. It is based on a series of stories by the real Spotlight Team that earned The Globe the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service. The film stars Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, John Slattery, Stanley Tucci, Brian d'Arcy James, Liev Schreiber, and Billy Crudup.Spotlight was shown in the Out of Competition section of the 72nd Venice International Film Festival. It was also shown at the Telluride Film Festival and the Special Presentations section of the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival. The film was released on November 6, 2015, by Open Road Films. It won numerous guilds and critics' association awards, and was named one of the finest films of 2015 by various publications. It is nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Film Editing, Best Supporting Actor: Mark Ruffalo, Best Supporting Actress: Rachel McAdams, Best Original Screenplay, Best Director, and Best Picture.In 2001, The Boston Globe hires a new editor, Marty Baron. Baron meets Walter ""Robby"" Robinson, the editor of the Spotlight team, a small group of journalists writing investigative articles that take months to research and publish. After Baron reads a Globe column about a lawyer, Mitchell Garabedian, who says that Cardinal Law (the Archbishop of Boston) knew that the priest John Geoghan was sexually abusing children and did nothing to stop him, he urges the Spotlight team to investigate. Journalist Michael Rezendes contacts Garabedian, who initially declines interview. Though he is told not to, Rezendes reveals that he is on the Spotlight team, persuading Garabedian to talk.Initially believing that they are following the story of one priest who was moved around several times, the Spotlight team begin to uncover a pattern of sexual abuse of children by Catholic priests in Massachusetts, and an ongoing cover-up by the Boston Archdiocese. Through a man who heads a victim's rights organization, they widen their search to thirteen priests. They learn through an ex-priest who worked trying to rehabilitate pedophile priests that there should be approximately ninety abusive priests in Boston. Through their research, they develop a list of eighty-seven names, and begin to find their victims to back up their suspicions. When the September 11 attacks occur, the team is forced to deprioritize the story. They regain momentum when Rezendes learns from Garabedian that there are publicly available documents that confirm Cardinal Law was aware of the problem and ignored it. After The Boston Globe wins a case to have even more legal documents unsealed, the Spotlight Team finally begins to write the story, and plan to publish their findings in early 2002.As they are about to go to print, Robinson confesses to the team that he was sent a list of twenty pedophile priests in 1993 in a story he never followed up on. Baron, nevertheless, tells Robinson and the team that the work they are doing is important. The story goes to print with a link leading to the documents that expose Cardinal Law, and a phone number requesting victims of pedophile priests to come forward. The following morning, the Spotlight team is inundated with phone calls from victims coming forward to tell their stories. The film closes with a list of places in the United States and around the world where the Catholic Church has been involved in concealing abuse by priests."
"It is no secret that I left the Church for many years after they failed to deal with the abuse scandal. Like the Globe personnel, I had no idea of the scope of the problem. I was just angry that those responsible had gotten away with it.The Globe thought this story was worthwhile when they had uncovered 13 priests that abused children. When they discovered it was closer to 90, they were shocked. The eventual number in Boston was 186! This is not surprising when it is estimated that 50% of all priests are not celibate.Mark Ruffalo was amazing in this film, and Rachel McAdams was superb. Neither will likely win awards in a year of fantastic performances, but there is a chance the film may steal an Oscar. It would be a great thing.The film was very difficult for a Catholic to watch, but it was definitely worth it. Unlike the recent documentary, Mea Maxima Culpa, it focused on the Globe and the story, and not the abuse."
"It won best film, deservedly so. This is a film that resonated with me long after I watched it. The complicated tale of the investigation of paedophile priests in Boston and the publication of it is told in riveting fashion by Tom Macarthy who does not waste a frame or a scene to anything less than the plot or character development. I never felt the running time or in any way disbelieved any of the actors in their portrayals.Keaton seems to be on a total roll at the moment and he is excellent as the head of Spotlight but the whole ensemble seemed to put in a real shift. This felt like a documentary at times and I could feel the audience around me leaning forward as each new revelation is uttered. Just brilliant."
"Throughout the year I watched many movies and by the middle of the year I was finding it hard to watch a movie. I really had to force my self. I thought my love for movies is dying and I'm more of a TV person now. I was wrong. This movie (and the big short) proved to me that it wasn't me, it was actually the movies I've seen this year.This movie has it's flaws for sure. But the acting, script, direction, design and pace of the movie adds a lot to an already strong and heart breaking story. I was on the edge of my seat and even after the movie ended I couldn't move for a while. A well made film that I recommend to any drama fan. It certainly helped me find my love for movies again.Even with it's flaws I give it a 9.5"
"... because by the time the credits roll and you start to breathe normally again, you will suddenly realize that this was not a horror film as such, this was a re-enactment of events that actually happened, with real victims and real perpetrators and real well-meaning third parties covering up the whole thing as fast as the body count kept piling up.And then you will once again have difficulty catching your breath.As a film it is superb. McCarthy who did double duty as writer and director deserves acknowledgement. The cast is universally excellent. Ruffalo gives the performance of his career, Keaton is solid as a rock, and McAdams reaps overdue dividends from her decision to broaden her career into non-glamorous roles at a time when the only scripts they were sending her were for Diva parts. Smart lady.A reviewer is not supposed to interject personal feelings in a review but I will say without apology that I miss films like these -- films that speak for the injustice in society and offer solutions -- and wish there were more of them. It seems that when I was younger there was a lot more interest in doing the right thing merely because it was the right thing. This no longer seems to be the societal meme, and that troubles me.A must-see."
"In ""All the President's Men"", young reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein uncovered a national political scandal when they, through their investigative journalism, revealed the White House under then President Richard Nixon was using campaign funding to finance dirty tricks of political enemies, nicknamed Watergate. In ""Spotlight"", a similar team of investigative reporters reveal a scandal of epic proportions which makes much of the Watergate scandal seem tame by comparison. They uncovered widespread sexual abuse of minors committed by priests of the Roman Catholic Church who, in turn, hid the crimes. Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Walter V. Robinson (Michael Keaton), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), Martin ""Marty"" Baron (Leiv Schreiber), Ben Bradlee Jr. (John Slattery), and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James) work for a group of investigative reporters within the Boston Globe called ""Spotlight"" who succeed in finding the skeletons in the Boston Diocese proverbial closet. For many years prior to the sexual abuse scandal, Spotlight had investigated and reported on many other ground-breaking stories.The story begins with a quick flash-back to 1976 when a priest is jailed for sexual abusing a minor. The film then cuts to 2001. Marty Baron (Schreiber), a Jewish Floridian, becomes the main editor for the Boston Globe. He meets the different editors and journalists, and learns of work by Spotlight. A Globe column reveals a lawyer, Mitchell Garabedian, claims Cardinal Law, then Archbishop of Boston, knew Father John Geoghan, a priest within Law's diocese, was sexually abusing children, and the bishop did not bring him to the attention of authorities. Baron urges the Spotlight team to investigate further to see whether the claim is true and an isolated incident, or if there is more to the story. The ""seed"" is similar to the break-in of the democratic headquarters at the Watergate Complex which eventually revealed the Nixon White House had been engaging in multiple plots against perceived political enemies.The Spotlight team is headed by Walter ""Robby"" Robinson (Keaton), a no-nonsense fair but tough reporter/editor. They agree to Baron's wishes and begin researching deeper to see if there is a larger story. Their first lead is the attorney mentioned in the article, Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci). Rezendes (Ruffalo) peruses Garabedian who acted as negotiator between the Boston Archdiocese and victims of Father Geoghan. The reporter wishes the attorney to reveal names of the victims, but at first Garabedian declines. Eventually, Garabedian agrees to contact victims, who are now much older, and ask them if they are willing to speak with Rezendes without revealing their names. Eventually, interviews are set up at the attorney's offices. The question then becomes whether there were other priests who engaged in similar criminal behavior against minors.On another front, other members of the team, including Sacha Pfeiffer (McAdams), begin discovering the unspeakable reality of other victims possibly at the hands of more priests, aside from Geoghan. Then a tip from a former rehabilitation counselor for priests informs the team that, based on statistics, there may be as many as 90 priests involved with sexual abuse of children in the Boston Area alone. The team then appropriates volumes of an American guide book of Roman Catholic priests, published once a year, which lists the whereabouts of every clergyman in the church in terms of dioceses and parishes. The investigators make a startling discovery. Certain names in the book over several years are listed as ""on leave due to illness"", ""on administrative leave"", or other designations of inactivity after only one to three years at a particular parish, leading the team to consider these may be priests who engaged in sexual misconduct with minors. If true, it would place blame not only on Cardinal Law as possibly covering up the church's indiscretions but the entire Roman Catholic Church, all the way to the Vatican.This is a stunning film about the power of a small group of urban reporters to uncover wrongdoing by one of the oldest and far-reaching institutions in the world: The Roman Catholic Church. In particular high marks for Mark Ruffalo as Michael Rezendes, Rachel McAdams as Sacha Pfeiffer, and Michael Keaton as Robbie Robinson. So much of the story parallels the Watergate Scandal of several decades earlier. As horrible as the actual victimization of minors by the priests, often boys because they were less likely to ""squeal"" because of the shame, the cover-up by Law was nearly as criminal. Instead of taking the priests to justice, as he should have done, he tried to cover it up by offering settlements to the families, often when the victims were minors. Law and probably other church officials moved the priests to other parishes where they engaged in similar behavior, thus allowing widespread sexual abuse to continue. It was eventually revealed that not only did these sexual predators victimize children in other parts of the country, it was happening internationally."
"Seconds after the credits for Tom McCarthy's ""Spotlight"" roll, an overwhelming feeling of changing your career takes over. Is film criticism really where I belong? What important, life-changing story am I not writing about? Truth is, quite a bit of classic films give off that same feeling. ""Rocky"" made a bunch of our fathers and older brothers go for a morning run and drink raw eggs. ""Rudy"" made us want to go out and play Notre Dame football. ""Spotlight"" makes you want to go down to your local courthouse and search the public records for clues. Then, get on the phone, with a pen and a pad, and start asking some really tough questions. Honestly speaking, ""Spotlight"" is the best investigative news drama this century. Matter of fact, behind ""All the President's Men"" and maybe ""The Insider,"" it's among the best ever made.""Spotlight"" tells the true story of how the Boston Globe uncovered the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese, shaking the entire Catholic Church to its core.Where you must begin, with any praise for the film, is the audacious and fortifying script by Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer. The two create cinematic magic in their articulation of words, characters, and narrative storytelling. Each person feels authentic. Each scene feels rich and equally important as the last. And most of all, its the tightest, most satisfying film from beginning to end, seen this year. From minute one, you're hooked, up until the last second, where they decide the last words spoken should be, ""Spotlight"" is astonishingly crafted.I'm still in shock and awe that Tom McCarthy is the one who made this. This is a writer/director who I've appreciated but didn't have the ""love"" factor surrounding any of his films. Paired with an outstanding cast, co-writer Josh Singer, editor Tom McArdle, cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi and composer Howard Shore, Tom McCarthy gets a chance to create his masterpieceand succeeds. He makes brilliant artistic choices, such as letting a Mark Ruffalo letter reading play over a 2-minute taxi car ride back to the newspaper. McCarthy's direction is one of the best directorial efforts from any filmmaker this year thus far.All the players performing are top-notch but walking away, best-in- show, is the performance of Academy Award nominee Mark Ruffalo. Ruffalo exhibits his best screen performance to date, and makes a stake in his claim for the Oscar this year. Weirdly reminiscent of Joaquin Phoenix's work in ""The Master,"" Ruffalo builds his 'Mike' from the feet up, giving him his own characteristics that I'm not sure McCarthy and Singer set out to do. His expressions in words, mannerisms, all encapsulate the magnitude of his work, bookended by an explosive scene that brought tears to my eyes. Think back to Emma Stone's acclaimed work in ""Birdman,"" and the scene that made everyone notice. I wanted to simply applaud.Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams, who play ""Robbie"" and ""Sacha"" respectively, are attune with their characters and destinations. Each bring strong sensibilities and sensitivity to their roles that desperately call for them. Hotly worked into the story is Liev Schreiber as a newly appointed Editor, that in the little screen time he's given, makes a long-lasting impression. Stanley Tucci is also afforded the same opportunity, and gives one of the film's best monologues.If there's a film this year that feels like an Oscar-winner, ""Spotlight"" sure does make a compelling case. Dramatic, heart- pounding, and necessarily made. It's one of the most important films this year and probably THE BEST PICTURE OF THE YEAR. The Telluride tradition may continue."
"Everything about this movie is outstanding -- the performances, the way the true events are handled, the cinematography. In this day of digital news, this movie makes us stand back and realize what we may lose in the way of investigative journalism as we slowly kill off print media.The lengths the directors go to to achieve a sense of authenticity is remarkable. We are there in Boston in 2001-2002. We get to know enough about each character to make him or her real, but not enough to create side dramas. The focus remains the child abuse scandal in the archdiocese in Boston. That reflects the conflict the characters face and deal with when events make them rethink the focus of their article.The movie is riveting, though we know the outcome."
"Going into 'Spotlight' I was aware that it was the front runner to win Best PIcture at the Academy Awards. After having seen it I can't really understand why. That's not to say it wasn't a good film, it simply didn't blow me away at all. It told a story, an admittedly fascinating and true story, in an informative way but it didn't do anything that great films do like inspire me, move me or leave me stunned with the powerful nature it was told with. Best Picture winners of the past, like 'Schindler's List', told true stories but also encompassed all three of those traits and plenty more. That was a film I will never forget, 'Spotlight' will probably be completely out of my mind by this time next week. Frankly, I was a little underwhelmed with the lack of emotion such a serious subject brought out in me. The film just didn't really seem to try to do that. It felt more like a documentary reenactment, simply with very fine actors, than anything else.My disagreement with it likely winning Best Picture aside, there are some very fine filmmaking skills on show here in all departments. Director Tom McCarthy, in only his fifth turn at directing, has been nominated for a Best Directing award. While I don't like the lack of emotion his storytelling brought out in me, he clearly had a vision to tell a story in a certain way, and he got it done. He tells it in a punchy fashion that never allows the audience to drift off. The Best Directing race this year is a tight one with four of the five all being widely in contention. I don't think McCarthy will get the win however, as his film doesn't have the ""X-Factor"" going for it that a lot of the others do. Having said that, any film that wins Best Picture has to get some real credit for its director, so don't completely rule him out if it does indeed win that.Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams have also been nominated for Best Supporting Actor and Actress awards. I have trouble understanding how, to again be frank. Roles based on real life characters always get more attention than others but these two had absolutely nothing to work with in the script. They were almost never given a chance to shine in any scene. Because of this I don't believe either has a chance of winning their respective award. It wasn't a film designed to make actors look good. Having said that, the stand out performance for me was Michael Keaton. He almost won the Best Actor award last year and this year can't even get a nomination. Had his been considered a Supporting Role I'm sure he would have but it was probably considered in that ""in between"" state, which may have hurt him.There are a lot of true stories at this year's Acadmey Awards and I think 'Spotlight' is benefiting from being the most interesting story of them all. 'The Big Short' is another case of an interesting true story, however that was told in a very unique and clever way. Interestingly, that is the biggest competition 'Spotlight' will have when the winner is read out on the night. My fingers might just be crossed on the seeing the upset."
"Garnered awards and horrifying subject matter put aside, take a look at the movie poster for ""Spotlight"". It's a still image of the principal cast hovered over a cluttered desk in a small room. It's not flashy, but still an incredibly effective piece of advertising. You know in an instant that this is a journalism movie; die-hards in rolled-up shirtsleeves working all hours to unearth a national scandal. I am an absolute sucker for this.The scandal herein is the systemic cover-up of pederasty within the Catholic Church. To that end (even though a lot of the dialogue in this movie is come-from-behind startling), one line in particular jumped out at me: ""They say it's just physical abuse but it's more than that, this was spiritual abuse. You know why I went along with everything? Because priests are supposed to be the good guys."" This isn't just a story about the crimes committed, but there's also sensitivity towards the victims themselves. I dunno, I just found that line deeply unnerving.But when all is said and done, this movie runs on the grueling nuts-and-bolts detective work of investigative journalism; a uniformly excellent cast, great writing and tension that continues to build.Amazing stuff.9/10"
"I liked this film, thought it was a well done solid film. But I am afraid I can't say anything more than that, it is very documentary like which can be it's biggest strength (a very fact driven plot heavy film) or it's biggest weakness (characters feel cold and distant and other than the plot nothing really impresses, also quite bland in the visuals department). However the characters do start to show some life nearing the end of the film but by that time damage is done it can be hard if not impossible for viewers to differentiate between the reporters for nearly one and a half hour of the film, they all suffer from different faces but same objective syndrome and inadequate effort is made to separate one from the another. Also speaking of run-time, this film is a wee bit over two hours long, editing especially in the first half could have made this film a bit crispier. However I did like the accuracy level in the film regarding the cellphones, ads, electronics and the cars used in 2001; a lot of films these days are becoming very careless in this regard. I would compare it to last year's Foxcatcher another fact driven docu-drama film, solidly acted, but nothing special in the direction, editing and cinematography department, I would still recommend it but no way this film deserves a second watch, you can absorb everything there is to get in a single viewing. All in all, a solid well written docu-drama which will have it's time in the ""spotlight"" (pun!) this Oscar season and will become ""oh that movie about pedo priests"" by next year's Oscar season."
"""Spotlight"" is the best film of 2015 and I will be disappointed if it does not receive the Academy Award for Best Picture. As good as it is, it is just one step short of greatness. ""Spotlight"" depicts Boston Globe reporters investigating priest sex abuse of children. ""Spotlight"" focuses like a laser on what it is to be a journalist, to consider whether or not to cover a story, to select it, to research it, to uncover piece-by-piece, a full narrative, to publish it and to live with the consequences of publication. You don't learn about the reporter's personal lives except for what you see incidentally as they work at home. There is no romantic subplot; there are no trumped-up action scenes where a reporter punches a priest. There's actually one of those scenes, no doubt a self- conscious salute to classic newspaper films, where you see newspapers being run through one of those giant machines that rapidly prints, folds, and stacks hard copies. I've never seen a film in which I liked these actors more: Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Live Schreiber, John Slattery, Brian D'Arcy James, Stanley Tucci, Billy Crudup, Len Cariou. Lesser known actors in minor roles are every bit as good. There is no Hollywood in these performances. There's no sexy costumes or makeup, no grandstanding for the Academy. The actors are dressed in the workaday attire of newspapermen and women. Much of the film takes place in a grubby shared office full of sloppy manila file folders or in cafes and working class neighborhoods where informants are interviewed. Each performer plays a cog in a giant wheel working to uncover evil. None of them knows about world-shaking scandal still to come, or Pulitzer Prizes. They are just, with a pair of tweezers, turning over one leaf and seeing what lies beneath and adding that to the information already gathered. Even though viewers already know how this story played out in real life, the audience gasps when a discovery is made; the audience fears that a rock will be thrown through a window; the audience fears that judicial complicity will keep the story hidden. I began crying half an hour into the film. I was crying at the end. I made audible ""Huh!"" noises at especially and outrageously ironic moments, as did others in the audience. We applauded at the film's conclusion. The film opens with a child in a police station, accompanied by his parents and a priest. A lawyer enters. Everyone speaks in hushed tones. ""I promise this will never happen again."" The police are cynical. The lawyer is smooth. The child is crushed. The parents are heartbroken. The priest appears slickly demonic. The scene is anonymous. Events like this were repeated at least a thousand times. July, 2001. The Boston Globe acquires its first Jewish editor, Martin Baron. The Spotlight team is considering following up a case of priestly sex abuse. Slowly but surely, they discover that there are far more incidences than suspected. They discover not just one bad apple here and there. Rather, Cardinal Law has reassigned abusive priests to new parishes. Baron meets with Law. Law presents Baron with a copy of the Catechism of the Catholic Church. ""Spotlight"" mentions ""Good Germans"" – people who kept their eyes closed to the disappearance of their Jewish neighbors, and the sudden appearance of ash falling from the sky. Just so, there were many ""Good Bostonians."" It's sickening to confront the many who had awareness of priestly sex abuse and did nothing. Targeted kids were powerless and without allies. One had a schizophrenic mother. Some had absentee fathers. Some were gay. Many were from the wrong side of the tracks. After they were abused, some became alcoholics, drug addicts, or suicides. When SNAP activist Phil Saviano is invited to the Boston Globe's office, and he talks about a conspiracy to protect abusive priests that stretches all the way to the Vatican, he comes across as a twitchy, obnoxious, conspiracy theorist raving about Area 51 – someone easy to write off. The most nauseating reason of all given for ignoring clergy sex abuse: money. The Globe could have covered clergy sex abuse earlier, but it didn't. Over fifty percent of the paper's subscribers are Catholics. Boston is a small town, with a lot of insular Irish Catholics who don't want anyone rocking the boat, or risking various money streams, including the church's significant charity work. Especially poignant are the scenes where abuse survivors are encouraged to detail what happened to them. ""It's not enough to say he molested you. You must give me the clinical details of exactly what happened,"" reporters insist, to sobbing survivors, who must then re- inhabit their worst memories. The plot churns forward with the single line of a freight train running on schedule. I was never bored. The priestly sex abuse crisis is not a tragedy because the Catholic Church is corrupt. The priestly sex abuse crisis is a tragedy because the Catholic Church is great. The film could have become better than it is had it included this theme. Show Catholics feeding the homeless. Show Catholics recovering from grief with the support of their faith. Show Cardinal Law for what he once was – a courageous hero in the Civil Rights movement, when that meant receiving death threats and alienating the powerful. That something so beautiful is so sullied, along with individual victims' pain, is the heart of this tragedy. I am a lifelong, church-going Catholic. I present my reasons for being Catholic, in spite of everything, in my book ""Save Send Delete."" I salute, not boycott, the Globe's reporting, and films like this. Confession and redemption are gifts we shared with the world."
"""Spotlight"" is an American movie from last year that runs for slightly over 2 hours and was written and directed by Tom McCarthy. It won two Academy Awards earlier this year, including the grand prize for Best Picture. And the reason for this is probably that it is about a really important subject, namely the way it was discovered by a major newspaper that pedophilia was something that existed on a larger scale in the Church, despite many attempts of the latter to keep it disclosed. Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams managed Oscar nominations for their supporting performances. I cannot say I agree with either sadly. McAdams played her part well, had a couple good moments, but I don't think it was one of the best of the year in her category. Probably more of a coattail nomination, I remember it was also pretty surprising she got in. Ruffalo's nomination was no surprise, he got in at all the precursors too. But I had sometimes problems with his performance. It seem over-the-top theatrical and it had a touch of one man against the Church at times, which went entirely against the idea of the team collaboratively managing great things. I am usually a fan of Ruffalo and he has good moments here too, but I think a mix of not so good writing and perhaps not the best approach to the role may have hurt the character. Keaton, Tucci, Slattery and Schreiber are pretty much the same, good but not great, but probably on par with the two nominees. It was a team effort and nobody really stood out.In terms of the entire film, I summarized it appropriately in the title I believe. It is a very important subject and it was a strong cast making this subject work with dignity and professionalism, but I personally felt the heart was missing. And this subject certainly would have deserved to make a more emotional impact in the grand scheme of things than it did on me. The attempts by McCarthy to deliver in terms of that were something that felt rather forced than effective to me. They brought in references to the journalists' private lives and how it impacted them to some extent, but it did not feel too compelling to me to watch these and the victims also did not add as much as I hoped they would. The ending with Keaton's ""Spotlight"" quote was nicely done though. I also liked the way they brought in 9/11 getting in the way of disclosing the events. Overall, I believe this is an important movie that is worth watching mostly because it all happened in reality and because with the Best Picture win, it is probably now the defining film on a very contemporary and tragic occurrence of events. But I still feel it did not make the impact that it could have made and my favorite McCarthy film to this day stays ""The Visitor"". But I recommend ""Spotlight"" too of course. I would say it's nowhere near the best or worst Best Picture Academy Award winners."
"Greetings again from the darkness. Faith. A word that easily could have been the title of this gripping and heart-wrenching film. Faith can be defined as trust and belief. Faith can also be defined as religion and ideology. Few things are more devastating than broken faith  the core of this ""based on actual events"" story of The Boston Globe's exposure of rampant child molestation by dozens of Catholic priests, and the systematic cover-up by ""The Church"".It's challenging to name a movie that is as well-made as this one, while also being as difficult to watch. We know the story  we even know how it snow-balled globally  but the raw emotions of disgust and sheer anger permeate much of our being as we watch it unfold on screen. Director Tom McCarthy (The Station Agent, The Visitor) co-wrote the script with Josh Singer (The Fifth Estate) and it's worthy of favorable comparison to other investigative newspaper films like The Insider (1999), Zodiac (2007), and even the granddaddy of them all  All The President's Men (1976).The opening scene takes place in a 1976 Boston police station. A priest has been accused of molesting a child. Within a couple of minutes we witness the empty promises, the intimidation, and the cover up. So much is conveyed in this brief opener, not the least of which comes courtesy of the ambivalence of the veteran cop as he shrugs it off as 'just another day' in front of an idealistic rookie cop. This is accompanied by Howard Shore's spot-on score, with the best parts featuring only a piano and bass.Flash forward to 2001 as we meet the investigative journalist team called ""Spotlight"". It's led by editor Walter ""Robby"" Robinson (Michael Keaton) and his three reporters: Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha Pfieffer (Rachel McAdams), and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James). They report to Ben Bradlee Jr (John Slattery), whose father was the editor of The Washington Post during the Woodward/Bernstein/Watergate era. New to The Globe is managing editor Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber). Unlike the others, Mr. Baron is neither a Boston local nor a Catholic. In fact, we catch him reading Dan Shaughnessy's book ""The Curse of the Bambino"", just so he can get a better feel for the community and its people.What is most fascinating about the movie is that it focuses on the investigative aspects – just how diligent the reporters were in putting the story together – and how fluid the process was  the story led them, not vice versa. There was no media agenda to ""get"" the church. Instead, the reporters experienced natural shock as each piece of the puzzle was discovered. One of their key sources was a priest-turned-psychologist (voiced by Richard Jenkins) who helped them put scope to the numbers. Another was Phil Saviano (Neal Huff), the leader of a victim's group, who had tried before to provide documentation to the press. Saviano is the perfect example of how someone so passionate about a cause can be viewed with such skepticism  right up to the point when they are proved correct. Three attorneys add perspective to the cover-up. Eric Macleish (Billy Crudup) made a career of settling cases (and silencing victims) for the church. Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci) is the polar opposite – he fights vigorously to get the victims heard, while Jim Sullivan (Jamey Sheridan) is caught in the middle – settling cases for the church and struggling with his conscience. Other interesting characters include Paul Guilfoyle as Pete Conley, a smooth-talking power-broker for the church, and Len Cariou as Cardinal Law – the man at the top who eventually apologized and was rewarded with a high-ranking position at The Vatican.The film is so well crafted and acted that it features more than a few ""best scenes"". Sacha has a brief encounter with a former priest on his front door stoop. The priest freely admits to molesting kids and his rationalization will certainly deliver chills to most any viewer. Since this is Boston, it makes perfect sense for the reporters to be so distracted by the story, that it supersedes the Red Sox game they are attending at Fenway Park. Being that the investigation lasted well into 2001, it's quite informative to watch a news agency shift directions for the September 11 tragedy, and along with the nation, put all else on hold. Finally, there is a point in the movie where we as viewers have just about had our fill of extreme emotions – we either need to hit something or throw up – and reporter Rezendes comes through with exactly what is needed: an emotional outburst and release of exasperation rivaling anything previously seen on screen. It's a wonderful moment for Ruffalo as an actor, and a peak moment for viewers.The story hit the front page of The Boston Globe in January 2002. The paper won a Pulitzer Prize in 2003 for its superlative investigative journalism. The report vindicated so many who had been taken advantage of, and exposed the colossal arrogance of the church. The innocence of a child vs the power of God. The story broke the faith that so many once held, and started a global (as evidenced by the closing credits) reckoning and awakening that was desperately needed. The film offers a line of dialogue, ""It takes a village to raise a kid  or abuse one."" In other words, it took the often silent actions of so many to allow this despicably evil horror to continue. In a tribute to the newspaper profession, it took a small group of dedicated reporters to pull back a curtain that should never again be shut. Let's have faith in that."
"The awards season may just have found its first forerunner. In a 2015 movie year that has been average at best without any standout films initiating awards conversation, Tom McCarthy's Spotlight rising above the heap to assert itself as one of 2015's best.With an all-star cast including Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Live Schreiber, John Slattery, Stanley Tucci and Billy Crudup, Spotlight shines a light on a 2001 investigation by The Boston Globe's on the sexual abuse within the Catholic Church.Michael Keaton plays Walter Robinson who leads the Globe's investigative unit with Michael Rezendes (Ruffalo), Sacha (McAdams) and Matt Carrol (Brian d'Arcy James). Under a new editor Marty Baron (Schreiber), the team begins to unfold a horrific pattern of child sexual abuse by the church that was muted and covered up by high priced lawyers and payoffs to victim's families. As Walter probes further and further into the events (the setting is after the events the 9/11) the investigation reveals layers and layers of injustice of Catholic Priests that were aided by the highest powers of the church in an effort to keep the story muted.It all starts with a featured column about Catholic priest John Geoghan who was accused of abusing over 100 boys. A civil suit is filed but the details of the abuse were ordered sealed by the courts. Schrieber's Baron puts the team of reporters on the case and within days the evil that lurked with the sacred rooms of local churches begins to reveal is foul and despicable face.The investigation goes on for months as the team hits roadblock upon roadblock taking one step forward for every two steps back. But the story eventually breaks and the emotionally exhausted team is eventually able to bring to light one of the more depressing and important stories of the early new century.Michael Keaton was really good in last year's Birdman and named himself many awards and an Academy Award nomination for his part. In Spotlight, he may be even better. Under the direction of Tom McCarthy (Win Win, The Station Agent), Keaton shines and carries a performance of determination, frustration and redemption that is delivered with precision.Nods to All the President's Men will be inevitable. But that was a different era. A different movie. Spotlight is fresh and invigorating in its painfully frustrating subject matter. Audiences should leave with a renewed belief that investigative reporting is of monumental importance and that stories such as the one originating in 2001 Massachusetts are still out there clouded in red tape secrecy and muffled whispers. It is painful to watch at times. Trusted bonds between people, children, parents and the institution that promotes the opposite to what it sometimes preaches are disgusting revelations that are brought to the screen with sizzling effects.The entire cast from top to bottom is perfectly cast. And McCarthy doesn't populate his frames with unnecessary spectacular visuals. Spotlight is instead very straight forward. Focused and driven.Spotlight will be nominated for Best Picture and Keaton should get a nod for Actor. Ruffalo may also sneak his way onto ballot sheets. But whether Spotlight wins any hardware is unimportant as long as we recognize the importance of films such as these. A few years ago I would guess that 99% of the population knew nothing about the Iran hostage rescue highlighted in Ben Affleck's Argo. Spotlight should have the same effect acting as a docudrama that is both highly entertaining and educational at the same time. It is both a very good film and an important one.http://theintestinalfortitude.com/"
"""Spotlight"" is one of the best realistic and serious movies of recent years. I don't want to tell the story, as you will watch it soon or later, but I want to admire the movie and the content itself. Instead of falling into the stereotypical hero and anti-hero type of movies, the movie narrates the story with realistic characters, sensual REALISTIC emotions and incredibly depicts the integrity and handwork of the Boston Globe investigation team. The acting of Mark Ruffalo and Michael Keaton are great. Finally, the movie does not fall into the category of twisty blockbusters but a realistic movie about an important subject that anyone will admire."
"In the past 5+ years, I've read articles about the decline of cinema and the great successes of Television. There's no denying that there have been some wonderful TV/web series in recent years, but I think a film like Spotlight is the refresh button that moviegoers have been looking for. The story is compelling, the acting is unnoticeable, and the script seems to flow the way a real conversation would. The writers and director of this film are the ""Spotlight"" of filmmaking, opening up a sensitive story that people acknowledged but probably couldn't imagine on screen, and they brought it to us in a way where I felt all the emotions of someone finding out the truth for the first time. I watched Spotlight at the Zürich Film Festival and after 2 hours, thought it ended too soon. The only negative thing I could think of was that those French & German subtitles were really getting in the way. Maybe next time, the director could remove those ;)"
"This was a solid drama elevated by superior acting from a top-notch cast but I left the theater somewhat underwhelmed. The movie lacked the sort of drama that makes you wonder how the story will end even when you know how the story will end. The main problem is that the Catholic Church just doesn't come across as a particularly forceful adversary. We're told that the Church is so powerful and has kept the abuse hidden for decades, but when a group of reporters actually goes digging they encounter some roadblocks but nothing that gives you the sense that the Church was something to be feared. While I didn't necessarily need Cardinal Law to dispatch some Opus Dei goons to discourage the reporters and the victims, the movie would have been more rewarding if they'd encountered much stronger resistance from the Church, public officials, and their own family and friends."
"As several other reviewers have stated here, Spotlight is a ""solid"" film. There is absolutely no fault with the actors, who all acquit themselves very well, and the movie itself never drags.However, there's really no character in the movie whom the audience can latch onto. It's a terrific ensemble, but the fault, I think, lies in trying to give everyone in the ensemble an equal part in the story. Without making it about one person (whether a reporter or a victim), the emotional impact falls very, very short.What the viewer is left with is a general notion of, ""It's shocking that went on for so long and the church kept covering it up,"" but zero emotional investment and reaction. Unless you have a personal identification with any of the elements in this story, I think you will remain similarly aloof in regards to this film."
"I finally saw this film a few hours before tonight's Academy Awards broadcast. I had a feeling that it had the chops to win the big one. Many of my friends have been touting it. It takes a truly skilled director and screenwriter to entice an audience to watch something where they already know the result. We are made aware of the foothold of the Catholic Church in the city of Boston. When a new news director comes on board, he feeds the need for an investigation into priest misconduct to the Spotlight team, a group of hard core reporters who are unyielding in their persistent investigation of whatever story is there. The beauty of this film is that at no time is there a sense of sensationalism. Yes, the church tries to cut them off at the pass and uses sealed documents as a weapon, but time is the issue as much as anything visible. Strong performances abound, but the characters have weaknesses and at times become a bit emotional over their task. This plays out with subtlety and an almost you-are-there sense. Loved this."
"The film Spotlight plays like an average Joe type of movie. There is no inspiring cinematography or unique dialogue floating off the screen. It's a clean cut film about a team of reporters who decide to expose Priests molesting children in Boston- and later, we learn, all over the world.It takes place in 2001, right when the internet was just starting to replace print journalism as the new way people read their news. As the story opens, we learn that a section of the Boston Globe- the movie's title- is suffering from low ratings and no readers. The new boss that is hired to direct the team asks the Editor of Spotlight, Michael Keaton, how long it will take for the next story to unfold. ""A few months, maybe more."" Keaton says casually. This does not make his boss very enthused. The rest of the team, which includes Mark Ruffalo as an eager reporter, and Rachel McAdams as a bland one - begin digging for clues and interviewing victims of the Priests around town. Other people in town refuse to address the topic. Stanley Tucci, who is very good, eventually lets Ruffalo interview a victim who goes into deep detail on how his molestation took place. It's rather uncomfortable to hear, but necessary. McAdams also has interviews like this, and soon everybody wants the story to release. But then September 11th hits and they decide to wait. And wait longer. While the subject matter of the movie is very interesting, I found the movie to be an uninspiring showcase of events save some strong performances- Ruffalo and Tucci are the best in show. Keaton is okay but nothing to write home about. And Rachel McAdams has NEVER been so dull. Why she's the only one in Oscar consideration is beyond me; her character lacks any personality other then to speak like a dial tone and be the sole female on the team. She can do better than this. But because the script is dominated by male personalities (and screenwriters), what more do you expect?Is this the Best Picture of 2015? According to many sources, yes. It's the default, safe choice because allegedly voters aren't going to want to crown far more intriguing movies like The Martian, Mad Max, Brooklyn or Room- to name a few titles I found far more exhilarating. It's an okay attempt to tell this important story about a corrupt justice system and of course the Catholic Church in general. But it's stale when it comes to the artistry. FINAL GRADE: C"
"Despite its imposing title, Spotlight is an understated movie with a methodical approach that slowly gains momentum. It clearly, confidently shows us how our most precious resource, our children, have been damaged by abuse from catholic priests. This abuse has been prevalent mostly in the United States, but it has occurred wherever there is catholicism, and the church has systematically turned a blind eye to the proceedings. Some children have been driven to suicide by this abuse.In 2001 The Boston Globe decided to investigate one priest said to be abusing a large number of children, and the ensuing investigation reveals a huge cover up, with the catholic church using its power to frighten away the globe, and lawyers refusing to reveal important knowledge, and most importantly, an ex priest who rehabilitates abused children refusing to speak to the press.The Globe realises that they are handling one of the most important stories in the history of the newspaper, and their pursuit becomes relentless, leading to a shattering conclusion.This film scooped best picture at the Oscars and it bears all the hallmarks of the ultimate winner: absolute honesty and integrity in its subject matter, a complicated story simply told and beautifully acted by its committed team of actors. Most of the Spotlight team were catholics by birth and clearly this aided the process, the same applied to the actors, with Ruffalo particularly impressive as a reporter of Portuguese stock. I also liked Stanley Tucci as a lawyer who had dealt with many of the abused children, who was at first reluctant to deal with the Globe, but is won over by their commitment to the story.Abuse of one kind or another is a daily story in the newspapers these days, when it happened on this scale in a church it is even more shocking. This film lays out the facts in the most humane way possible, and everyone involved deserves credit for this. This really is a film that surely must give some comfort to the families that suffered because of this wicked abuse.Mary Gumsley"
"After watching Spotlight yesterday, I felt heartbroken, disgusted and furious. The topic, plot and dialogues built around them are amazingly good, but what's this movie's strongest point still remains remarkable acting of fantastic assembly cast - from Keaton and Ruffalo, to Huff and Creighton.My opinion about Thomas McCarthy was fairly split. Although he had done some pretty good (""The Visitor"", ""The Station Agent""), but also some average (""Win Win"", ""Million Dollar Arm"") and even bad (""The Cobbler"") movies, he had only directed 5 of them before ""Spotlight"", so I was inclined not to prejudge. Before watching the movie I've heard some pretty good comments about how he dealt with directing, and I have to say that he did pretty fair job with it. His and Singer's job as screenwriters, however, was done remarkably. It is one of those scripts where you can notice writers weren't afraid to be progressive, to input lots of names, events and different speaking styles to make it more realistic, active and suspenseful. You can definitely notice Singer has previously worked on lots of Crime TV series, as the script unravels in very thrilling, climatic way it usually happens in Crime TV shows.On the other hand, acting was just superb. I think this movie should serve as a benchmark for all the well-acted movies that are yet to come. I believe that, if Academy was to nominate 10 supporting actors this year, all 4 of them - Keaton, Ruffalo, Tucci and Schreiber would've gotten a nod. Sadly, beside Rylance (""Bridge of Spies""), Stallone (""Creed""), Elba (""Beasts of no Nation""), Shannon (""99 Homes"") and young Tremblay (""Room""), I can hardly see more than Keaton and Ruffalo in that race. I also think Rachel McAdams does a pretty good job as an only female Spotlight reporter. In fact, her ""interrogation"" scenes with Keaton tie with Ruffalo's amazing ""It could've been you, it could've been me, it could've been any of us"" monologue for the best scenes of, not just the movie, but maybe even the whole year.To be honest, Spotlight is no Birdman, but it is still the greatest drama of the year. It's a very clever movie, with immensely important topic and near-perfect dialogues, crafted both by amazing actors and great screen writing. If ""The Revenant"", ""Joy"" or ""Hateful Eight"" don't prove to be better, this is the movie I will root for during the Oscar night.Movie rating: 8.9/10 My ""Best Movies of 2015"" list: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls031061874/ My ""Best Movies Ever Made"" list: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls072746304/"
"Brilliantly acted, directed, and written, I just found this riveting and important film to be truly exceptional. Much of it is done in a low-key style, as layer after layer of the abuse by Catholic priests and subsequent cover-up by the Boston Archdiocese as well as other powerful interests, is uncovered by the Spotlight investigative team of the Boston Globe, in the early 2000's.I haven't yet seen all the movies nominated for the Best Picture Academy Award in 2016, but I can certainly see how this one won it, as well as winning Best Original Screenplay by Tom McCarthy (who also directed) and Josh Singer.Overall, just an outstanding motion picture that I would recommend highly."
"Yet another film I've watched because it's a contender for the award ceremonies next year and you can see why . The Oscars have taken onboard movies with an indie feel over the last few years and with SPOTLIGHT we have a double whammy of a film based on true life events this time featuring The Boston Globe investigation in to child sex abuse and the resulting cover over decades in Boston , Get these prizes out now Or on second thoughts put them away for the time being because SPOTLIGHT is something of a disappointment . Not so much a disappointment a film that doesn't really do anything radical in its sub-genre. Investigative journalism movies all suffer from the same structural problems along these lines: Journalist A gets hold of a possible lead , gets pulled in to the editors office and is told ""We can't run this"" Journalist B gets another lead on the same story , gets pulled into the editors office and is told by the editor ""We can't run this"" Journalist A and B work behind the editors back on the story and cut through every red tape obstacle in their pathJournalist c gets another lead on the same story ... you can see where this is heading can't you ? One thing the film does do well is explain to a secular audience the type of metaphysical power a Catholic priest has over a congregation but apart from that the rest of the film is curiously uninvolving and distant and one wonders if the acclaim it is receiving might be down to the subject matter rather than its cinematic credentials As it stands SPOTLIGHT is yet another slightly unsatisfying film expected to win prestigious prizes . There's no doubt in my mind that the 2016 Oscars will be dominated by THE REVENANT . As with every year there's always a film at the ceremony that ends up close but no cigar where it gets several noms but no Oscar in any category . I think SPOTLIGHT or STEVE JOBS might have that dubious distinction next yearUpdate March 2016 . The academy got it wrong again"
"As a screenwriter this movie really upset me - a bunch of journalists expose a case, where hundreds of children have been molested by priests, and covered up by the church. How do the journalists expose it? they call up a bunch of guys who said it before, but nobody listened to them. No doubt it's an important story, however I didn't detect any brilliant journalism - this is not All the President's Men, nor is it The Verdict where Paul Newman battled against the church. Spotlight reporters never stray in the dark or risk anything - the story is basically handed to them on a silver platter, and they only verify it. Drama? hell with it. worst of all - No brilliant cinema, no actions, just dialogue about this and that, we hardly get to know the characters outside of work, so we don't care about them. Bottom line is that this horrible case leaves hardly any impact. By the end of the movie you just realize that there have been pedophile priests. Didn't we already know this? No climax, no anticlimax, no heroes to root for. Hell I don't understand the raving reviews."
"""Spotlight"" Cast a Shadow on the Catholic ChurchWith an all-star cast and a compelling story, ""Spotlight"" delivers a blandly straightforward telling of the priest sex-abuse scandal and cover-up through the investigative story featured in the Boston Globe in the early 2000s. The city of Boston was torn apart by the scandal that had lasted for decades, and according the film, many people worked to shield the Church from the consequences of the scandal. Without the cover-up, the scandal would not have lasted so long. However well done and easy to follow the story was, it was predictable. Few revelations were made for me. Certainly, it is an important story to tell, and I am glad I saw the film. However, none of the characters lived up to the power of story itself and the actors adding little to its telling. This may be the case of too much story, too little screen time. The film attempted in a couple of cases to make the suffering of the survivors real, but it played like an episode of ""Law and Order: Special Victims Unit"" and not like a feature film. It was too small for such a lofty topic. In the film, they often mentioned that people died, but it seemed unreal. Examples of that were need to bring it home. The film covered too much time without making the connections for the audience. I really want to like this film more, but it fails as cinema in too many ways. It would have made a better Lifetime Channel Drama as it was written. Rating: Matinée""Spotlight"" is good but not great. After a while, Mark Ruffalo's (playing lead reporter Mike Rezendez) pained expression wears thin. Does he have any other look? Not much in this film. Stanley Tucci puts in a good turn as a lawyer working with the survivors, but the rest of the cast is pedestrian. Perhaps it was the writing, but the film and characters didn't greatly impact me despite the best intentions of the filmmakers and the tragedy of the true story. Peace, Tex Shelters"
"This is a movie about the sex abuse scandal by Catholic priests in Boston. It is a movie that should have been made properly since abstract headlines don't tell a lucid story. However, making it from the point of view of the Boston Globe journalists simply isn't that interesting. It should just have been one of the aspects of the movie but not the main one. More emphasis on the victims and families, some major perpetrators, high ranking clergy actually doing the cover up etc could have been shown. After all, the reporters are not the main players in this tragedy. A more complete picture like in ""And the Band Played On"" would have been better. Difficult to keep track of who all the lawyers and reporters are.The earnest actors are all people you want to see succeed in their quest. Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams particularly exude journalistic integrity. Liev Schreiber looks different here. As far as awards there just isn't that much of an actual acting role for any of the lead actors.The wrong focus of the story makes a scandal difficult to follow and tedious."
"Before you consider watching ""Spotlight"", I STRONGLY urge you to think twice. It isn't because I think it's a bad film--it's amazingly good. But it's also a difficult film to watch--particularly if you or someone close to you has been a victim of sexual abuse. I know that in my case, it was particularly tough because I am a retired psychotherapist and used to specialize in working with sexual abuse victims and perpetrators...the latter, which, I think benefit very little from treatment (which is much of the reasons I changed careers).The story is about not only the discovery of a huge number of pedophile priests in the Boston parish by Boston Globe reporters but the organization's discovery that the problem went all the way to the top. In other words, even the beloved Cardinal Bernard Law KNEW about the many, many victims and yet did nothing to discipline them or restrict their access to more victims. But the film doesn't just talk about so much that we know to be true today but it covers the stop by step process by which the paper began and completed the investigation.Why did I give the film a 10...particularly since I almost never give films such high scores? Well, the reason is that the folks making the movie really, really cared about the subject matter and getting it right. Instead of focusing on making money with the film and including the usual glitz and glamour, the filmmakers chose instead to emphasize realism above all else. Normal looking actors (such as Michael Keaton and Mark Ruffalo) are used...and they make efforts to keep them normal looking. Additionally, the film has a relatively slow and deliberate pace--again as they weren't interested in making a pretty or Hollywoodizing the production. Overall, a great film made greater because the folks making it really, really seemed to care and wanted to get it right...which showed great sensitivity for the subject matter and the victims. Great film!"
"This movie is one of the finest movie I have come across in recent past. The movie is based on true event and it is very important to acknowledge the research work made while making the movie. It will not leave to a second on which you say its going over the top. The inside of newspaper industry covered so well. Some of the punchline and scenes are best on its own. As the movie move forward you go along with it and if you don't have any background about the movie before you start you will also realize with the cast that ""how big this story is?"" Time and again it remind you the importance of newspaper and the hard work put in a lead to make it a story. Last but important part I would like to highlight that this movie does not left any stone upturned. The same newspaper did not look into the evidence send by same people in past which make you think its not you who is upgrading your knowledge but its a newspaper who decided what truth you want to hear. My best wished to the movie and hope it will do great."
"I've been reading through the reviews of this film wondering if these people are paid to boast this film as Oscar worthy. Don't get me wrong, movies have been going downhill for years, but this was one of the most overrated films I've seen in awhile. I guess it doesn't take much to impress people these days. Was I the only one who didn't think it was dark enough? I've seen darker Lifetime movies than this, and the whole movie is entirely built on conversation with very little action. The acting was OK, but the script was just bleh. I felt like it never reached an impactful climax, and I was hoping to see some gnarly stuff given the topic. I was really looking to seeing this movie, it had all the workings of what could have been a great film, but it just didn't deliver. Based on the story topic, it should have been knocked out of the ballpark, but to me, it fell completely flat. I'm even having a hard time remembering what I saw because I was so bored throughout the film and left feeling like what I just saw was forgettable pretentious garbage."
"I get why movies like this get nominated for Best Picture and why topical pictures get so much attention and star-studded casts. It's an If this worth an Oscar...how it won best picture is beyond me!!!! Seriously though, it's just dull. There is nothing in this movie that is cinematically interesting. Just scene after scene of people in varying states of agitation either reading or speaking. Compare this to a movie like Steve Jobs (2015) which is also very dialogue heavy and note all the various ways in which Boyle and crew aid their dialogue through camera movement, interesting angles and shadowing, etc. It makes you realize how thoroughly uninteresting Spotlight is in that particular way. Spotlight could have been done as a picture book with a few sentences of dialogue per page and Mark Ruffalo's happy face or sad face plastered on top.3 stars though just because a very interesting subject."
"The truth is that it's a well-known fact that Kristen Lombardi of the Boston Phoenix broke this story long before the cowardly editors at the Boston Globe finally ran their version. She, Lombardi, and the Phoenix did the dirty work and the Globe took the credit and is still taking the credit. The rumor, at the time, was that the Globe was bullied by the church into denying that any of the stories published by the Phoenix were true. The Globe became complicit in helping the church keep the story as quiet as possible. This movie is based on a gross misrepresentation of the facts and is being sold on television shows like 'Charlie Rose' as a monument to the Globe's courage and capability in investigative journalism."
"""Spotlight"" is based on one the biggest scandals that has rocked the Catholic church, and just about anything which affects religion and its consequences, is the stuff that fuels the best dramas and performances. Mix children, cover ups, legal maneuvers, with some of the best working today, and you should have a winner, but ""Spotlight"" is a long way from achieving its goal.Michael Keaton is a hundred times better than he was in ""Birdman"", where he looked like has no direction at all. Here he's a conflicted soul who must weigh his working ethics against his personal faith. He, along with his team become part of an investigation that reveals darker truths that they imagine or want to hear. We see stereotype after type make appearances: the eager reporter, the centered editor, the professional lawyer, the loyal follower, the reporter with the big heart, etc. The entire bunch of elements are there, but there is something that throws the whole film out of balance for no matter how horrendous every discovery is, we remain numb, and this is not the result of our shock. It's just the inability of the film makers to connect to either th material or provide that connection to us. Scorcese's film about Christ's alternate life was one of the most controversial ever, only to culminate in one of the most faith reaffirming moments in cinema. ""All The President's Men"" remains the finest example of newspaper reporting cinema, engaging us with fine performances, a magnificent script, and some of the exciting directing choices for this type of film. That world is dark and threatening, and no matter how many times we see it, we are full participants in the reporters' quest. Redford's and Hoffman's turns are classic. Here, the actors try really hard to save the day, but they have limited material to work with. It's not the nature of the controversy, but the poor adaptation that ends up feeling like we're watching a poorly edited documentary that says a lot but forgets the hideous nature of the problem. We have statistics thrown at us every five minutes, and we are given the token shocking lines and scenes, but with a couple of exceptions they feel empty, hollow.Ruffalo is wasted, McAdams was way more interesting in ""Morning Glory"" where she was allowed to open her soul. Here she reads her lines, stands where the marks are, but one can sense a little frustration as it's clear she's trying to hard. Keaton is the only one who is able to come up with a semblance of pain and conflict, and Liev is one character that because of his role manages to ring true since he's not given the opportunity to be smothered by bad script.If you want to feel the emotional power of the story, read the novel where we get closer and deeper in the hell that these incidents were. I was wondering why that annoying and overbearing score kept intruding, and in one of the few moments of quiet, it stops, giving the film more power by its mere absence, only to be ruined a chorus of snoring patrons behind me that had already succumbed to this overlong and uninvolving piece of film."
"Spotlight is based on the true story of a Boston Globe editorial team's efforts to uncover systematic child abuse and abuser protection by the Catholic Church. Hardly fresh news, and a topic that will raise strong emotional reactions, and rightly so. But how does it hold up?Given the weird emotional volatility surrounding this one, allow me to qualify this review (and its writer): the scandal revisited here is unarguably heinous, as are the many people who took part in perpetuating it. My own feelings about organized religion mean I was only mildly surprised, but then perhaps the subject of the clergy's hypocrisy is worth revisiting, as it has been in entertainment since Moliere's Tartuffe. But this is a film website, the medium is narrative film, and so Spotlight should - and shall, in the longer term - be judged.This is a film that owes its success and Oscar nominations to its topic and, to a lesser extent, to its ensemble cast. It is also a throw-back to harder-nosed journalism-based films like All The President's Men - a much better, less self-righteous film. The end result however is a bit awkward: first, the structure is wobbly, throwing us in headfirst and assuming perhaps too much familiarity with the events. The character introductions are very rushed, which means it takes more time to build empathy, especially when it comes to the victims. The climax, such as it is, and ensuing denouement are a bit limp culminating in the obligatory white text on black background to tell you succinctly with words what the filmmakers could not achieve with visuals. It makes you wish, as many reviewers have, that this were a documentary.The cast are uniformly good, with Stanley Tucci and Mark Buffalo the stand-outs, but these are solid, seasoned turns, nothing that cries out ""best performance of the year"". Technical credits are closer to a TV-movie than a major Hollywood release.I can't give it credit merely for tackling an easy target from such a safe distance, but I would concede more points if it told its story more fluidly and dared to explore some of the more dangerous angles a bit more, such as police collusion, or that one memorable scene where a guilty priest rationalizes what he did in a way that hints at even worse events. Sadly, this chooses to play things way too safe."
"Mmm, might make my top 50 of 2015. It's a perfectly good movie about investigative journalism, and it's interesting to see the process of journalists, but it's extremely pedestrian filmmaking and has like zero insight into the subject at hand (which is the cover-up of priest molestations). Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams and Brian d'Arcy James play the Spotlight team at the Boston Globe. They're all good, but, except for one big moment with Ruffalo, none of them do anything exceptional. The Globe's new editor, Liev Schreiber (somewhat more interesting, but not much), decides to follow-up on some earlier stories about the subject he thinks are incomplete. The best performance in the film belongs to Stanley Tucci, who plays a lawyer for victims. The second best belongs to Neal Huff as the leader of a victims' organization. Both Huff and Tucci are angry that the Globe is just now getting interested in the story. I think even critics in Boston know that Mad Max: Fury Road is a better film than this. Maybe some day the Spotlight team can uncover that conspiracy."
"I remember when this story broke back in 2002. It quickly became a huge story that spread all around the globe. As unthinkable as it seemed in the beginning, the mountain of evidence that built up, not only in Boston, but the rest of the world, showed everyone that people we trust, people we see as friends and guardians, have sexually abused children by the thousands.This happens right there, right in front of us. Powerful people know about it, and powerful people help covering it up. Lawyers, police, politicians, journalists, priests, u name it.It is absolute horror, and a story that needs to be told and understood. For how can this even be possible?. We live in what we call modern societies, where no one is left alone, where everyone has rights, where everyone will get help if needed. But this world did not exist for the children that are victims of this conspiracy.It is almost ironical that 9/11 happens right in the center of this story, and that the story is about people not paying attention, about people not doing what is needed to seek out the truth, especially to respect the victims of these crimes.Can conspiracies truly happen on such large scales?. Without ""anyone"" knowing about it?. Yes, it can. And even worse, people that we trust and believe in cover it up, and try to hide the truth.Thousands upon thousands of children abused, systematically, for years, by hundreds of priests, all over the world. Children. Our children. On our watch.This is a strong film, actually the best film i have seen this year, with ""The Big Short"" as number two. Which also show how a corrupt system works behind our backs, taking what we own, only to get richer and more powerful themselves.Who is the system?. It starts to look like our leaders and our masters, our politicians, who we elect, all are a part of a corrupt system, that works together, and that we, normal people are being farmed, so to speak. Is what I'm saying far fetched? I bet more and more people start to understand that this might be true, but to explain how it works, is very very difficult.The film explains how the Boston globe started out investigating one priest, and then just to reveal more and more cases, more victims, and then connecting child abuse to more and more priest. And as the story grows, the horror becomes real. It is a remarkable script, and the direction is steadfast.All actors in this film gives rock solid and some really remarkable performances, but my hats off to Mark Ruffalo. Again we see him at the top of his game, he is so good at what he does, i believe every second of what he delivers. Just like in ""Zodiac"" and ""Foxcatcher"" to mention a few.This movie got Oscar for best motion picture a few days ago, well deserved, and it also got the Oscar for best screenplay. As i also predicted, but not giving best supporting actor to Mark Ruffalo, was not the right decision IMO.See this movie everyone, it is an outstanding film, with very few flaws. It is a film that grips you the very first minute, and never lets go. It's a story about crimes we could not even dream of, not in the world we live in. And it needs to be told, understood and retold. Again and again and again.9/10 - Very Good"
"""Spotlight"" is the investigative team at the Boston Globe newspaper who focus on 'big' issues that they select to pursue - work that can take many months to come to fruition. Headed up by Robby Robinson (Michael Keaton) the rest of his team are Mike (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha (Rachel McAdams) and family man Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James). It's 2001 and times they are a changin' at The Globe. New editor Marty Baron (Liev Schrieber) is a workaholic wild duck from Florida with transformation in mind. He sees value in the team pursuing a 'cold' story about a Catholic priest accused of multiple counts of paedophilia, all of which appears to have been quietly 'shushed up' by the church. The investigation progressively uncovers a far more widespread and murkier story that goes on to break as a global scandal for the Catholic church.This is an important film given its controversial subject matter. And the acting is all top-notch. Michael Keaton feels extremely comfortable in his role as the investigative journalist, delivering one of the most 'goose-bumpy' lines in the film (as seen in the trailer) - ""Which story do you want us to write - because we're writing one of them"". He must have been disappointed not to receive another Best Actor nomination for this.Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams both did get the nod for the Supporting Actor/Actress nominations: Ruffalo's performance in particular is stellar, full of earnest passion. But it has to be said that all of the rest of the cast also more than pull their weight, with Liev Schrieber and John Slattery (as sub-editor Ben Bradlee) being very strong and the ever-reliable Stanley Tucci electrifying the screen as the dilligent but cranky lawyer Garabedian. As I write this, the Screen Actors Guild has just awarded ""Spotlight"" the award for the Best Ensemble Cast, and this is well deserved.The film looks great, with cinematography by Masanobu Takayanagi (""The Grey"", ""Silver Linings Playbook"") supported by fantastic lighting and superb editing (also Oscar nominated). It's refreshing that the location filming in Boston doesn't lean on the more 'touristy' shots normally depicted. The persistent and effective piano score is by Howard (""LOTR"") Shore.So, with all this going for it, I'm heading for a 10-star rating then? Well, actually, no. There is something distinctly missing in the film that was initially difficult to put my finger on. The film bears closest comparison with 1976's Redford/Hoffman classic ""All The President's Men"". And whilst it does compare in some ways (a lot of indecipherable dialogue and a mass of different names being one!) there's a key ingredient missing. While both stories were true, and you KNEW what the outcome was, ""All The President's Men"" still managed to build up an incredible sense of tension of the ""will they, won't they"" kind that is almost completely missing here. Not that there isn't the opportunity: for example, will delays (caused by certain other newsworthy events happening in September of that year) allow ""The Herald"" to break the story first? But no, the opportunity is squandered. A significant twist in the story (not spoiled here) around Keaton's character is also let off like a damp squib on a rainy night. And where was the scene of 'reaction' from the church, led by Boston's Cardinal Law (Len Cariou)? So the two Oscar nominations I would most have issues with are Best Director (for actor/director Tom McCarthy) and Best Picture: undeniably it's a good film, and you should go and see it, but in my eyes it was an opportunity missed - - it should have been an absolute classic.(Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review. Thanks.)"
"First off, this is an important film. The fact there's such a rampant systemic issue with an organization as large as the Catholic Church is appalling. The issue was known, but Spotlight highlights the story of the brave men and women who had to invest copious amounts of effort just to tell the world about it. This movie is brilliant all across the board: the performances, the cinematography, the story, the dialogue, the direction, and just about everything in-between. If you're Catholic, please understand this movie is NOT an attack on Catholocism, but mainly a film exploiting a systemic issue in the Catholic Church. If anything, Catholics should be more outraged than the rest of us, but I digress. Spotlight is a beautifully realized film with a very obvious amount of blood, sweat and tears put into it. From the geographic accuracy of Boston and other areas around it, to the details of the story, to the portrayals of the characters, Spotlight is a nigh-flawless product that not only excels on a technical level, but is going to have relevance for many generations to come."
"If you set aside the fact that these things did happen , and the political side of the film which is indeed a pretty heroic attack on the Church , a real punch from the Film industry to the Batican --- as a film experience it is mediocre. It's ""All the presidents Men"" -- but for the church instead of Watergate. The structure of the film is standard , it is cliché... Reporters making phone calls , trying to contact victims and informants. Offices and dusty files library.We have seen MANY films with the same exact pattern. The direction is typical , maybe the director thought the story is so damn big that he shouldn't emphasize on innovative direction and camera skills. As a film , it lacks essential stuff which keeps it from being a good one. No love story , not that great characters in general , the movie is only about the church scandal and everything else is low profile. I'm not putting down the actors who did a decent job ,and I like how Michael Keaton has gotten serious because I like to see this actor. I am a big Inarritu fan and enjoyed "" Birdman "" a lot.The Batman ( 1989) is a damn fine film and in my eyes the best Batman. -- in ""Spotlight"" he played with confidence and great skill this reporter fella. But I don't know this reporter and I didn't get to care about him. This goes same for the rest of the team. Liev Schreiber was a great casting choice. He fits right on the spot of the role he's playing. The thing about this movie is the story , the script isn't really strong. It rests too much on the impact of the subject matter and it minimizes all other aspects. Maybe if it was the first movie about investigative journalism and such ,then it would be OK. I doubt it though , and it is not the first film. To name some ,""Mystic River"" has the attributes of a fine film , dealing somewhat with child molestation and its outcomes. ""Happiness"" ( Solonz ) as well. "" Seven "" is a great film dealing with investigation , libraries , research and such --yes different genres -- but in the end they are good movies.""Spotlight"" is mediocre as an experience,for the average movie goer. The only people who may be tricked in calling this a "" masterpiece"" are the people directly involved with the historical happenings in it.p.s- I'm not a catholic and I don't care one bit about the Church. I'm not putting the film down because it hurts the church. I'm putting it down because it isn't anything new or special , objectively as a film experience."
"It feels to me like an hour long crime drama, like Law and Order: Special Victims Unit, except they are not cops, they're an investigative journalism team, very similar to the movie Truth, but instead of being TV journalist, they are members of the Boston Globe, but going up against just as powerful of an opponentThe Church.Based on a true story, Spotlight is an investigative news column within the Boston Globe, who back in 2001 were ask to do a follow up story on a Priest caught molesting, a child, which open up a bigger conspiracy. It was gripping watching this team go after the story. One of the elements that was really intriguing is how long it actually takes for this team to compile this particular story. It took them mouths to finish the story, but it does not feel like mouths, cause they make the story they try to compile interesting to watch. Plus we get to know the characters on a personal level without getting too personal. Nothing takes us away from the main focus of the movie.Mark Ruffalo gives an impressive performance as Michael Rezendes. He was very intense and passionate and it comes off great, and was a great role for him. He stood out in a very interesting ensemble cast that included Michael Keaton, as the editor of spotlight supporting his reporters as they chase the story and Liev Schreiber, as the new editor and chief of the Globe, an outsider who saw a story that the others too close to home, did not. They're other great performances from Rachel McAdams and Stanley Tucci as well. Spotlight also makes Boston itself a charter, by using scenery to show what a small town it can be and how much of an influence the Catholic Church has on it. It hits all the right buttons without trying, that's a sign of good story telling. It brings you into a compelling story, well acted by a great cast that did great things together."
"'Spotlight' has just won the 2016 Oscar for Best Picture, and deservedly so. However, 'Concussion' and 'Trumbo' did not even get nominated, though Bryan Cranston was nominated for his role in 'Trumbo' playing the eponymous communist screen-writer blacklisted by Hollywood. Will Smith playing the doctor who exposed the concussion scandal in American Football, like his film, is sorely neglected, but that is another story. What all three films have in common, is a story of powerful groups exerting their power at the expense of individuals. This seems a common theme and all three films are worthy products telling true stories.'Sleepers' (1996) told a tale of child sexual abuse. The authenticity of that film is much disputed. 'Spotlight', by contrast, is a factually true story, but one that reminded this reviewer of the earlier film because they both deal with the same subject matter. It is interesting to note that Billy Crudup appears in both films.A brief opening sequence, informs the viewer that the subject matter of the film is child sexual abuse committed by Boston priests, as is also quite clear from the trailers. The film then has a pleasant party scene at the Boston Globe newspaper marking the retirement of the newspaper editor. The film moves quickly into gear as the new editor, an outsider from Florida, played by Liev Schrieber, arrives. He meets Michael Keaton who plays the head of the Spotlight team. The editor is informed that Spotlight do long-term investigations, though at the moment they are trolling for work. The editor then tasks them with exploring and expanding on a smaller story of a priest guilty of child sexual abuse.The film that follows is almost totally concentrated on the ensuing investigation. We viewers see the team investigate the matter and realize, through the paper-trail, that this is not just about one priest, and that it is also about a cover-up too. Of the Spotlight team, Michael Keaton plays the cool-headed and practical manager, Mark Ruffalo plays a passionate and obsessed character, and Brian d'Arcy James's role is somewhat similar. Both are concerned with how close the issue is to them. We see this also in Rachel McAdams role too, though she is used more to show the drudgery of the investigation; firstly, as she knock doors, later, as she conducts interviews. All thespians convince in their authentic playing of newspaper investigators, appalled at the story that unfurled, committed to exposing the truth. John Slattery and Liev Schrieber, in smaller parts, play well their roles as overseers.Neal Huff and Michael Cyril Creighton are very impressive in their scenes as they explain grooming and child sexual abuse. It should be said that it is these references, and this subject matter, that gives this film a rating of 15 in the UK. It should also be said that these issues are discussed, but not shown.Mark Ruffalo and Liev Schrieber seem to have gone to some trouble to adopt distinctive accents that surprised this reviewer when first hearing them. Thankfully, the distinctive voice of Stanley Tucci was easily spotted, as he himself was not. He plays a campaigning lawyer who looks a little worn-down and unkempt, perhaps even in need of a haircut, which is why he is a little difficult to spot. Billy Crudup and Jamey Sheridan also play lawyers and Paul Guilfoyle also has a small role.Since the birth of Jesus Christ two thousand years ago, for the first one and a half thousand years there was only one Christian religion. In the last five hundred years the Catholic, or Roman Catholic, Church has still been the premier Christian religion. The church proclaims itself a church of sinners, but it's adherents were shocked to discover that so many, had sinned so much. For many, discovering the extent of sin within, to be precise; the extent of child sexual abuse by priests, and the cover-up by the hierarchy, has sickened them to their stomachs, and produced a crisis of faith. This is shown well in this film.Although a solid film about a newspaper investigation, this is also a sombre film, but one with a spot or two of moments of black humour, surprisingly. It tells the tale of the exposure of the cover-up of child sexual abuse in Boston by priests, a story that the powerful church tried to keep the lid on, but that lid was lifted, and the story went around the world.The story of powerful institutions using their powers at the expense of individuals, and then that power being broken by brave individuals, is one that often makes good material for a movie. This is certainly the case with regard to 'Spotlight'. The same themes are also at play in the excellent 'Concussion' and 'Trumbo', both of which deal with a single individual against a powerful institution, and both of which are worth seeing too. Those who like a good gangster film should know that the recent 'Black Mass' tells the story of the gangster Whitey Bulger, who was exposed as a protected FBI informer by the Spotlight investigation team of the Boston Globe.'Spotlight', which also won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, tells an important and true story, that is one that is well worth seeing. 10/10."
"Biographical drama about the research by the Boston Globe' Spotlight team on the scandal of child abuse by priests covered up by the local archdiocese. It's an investigative drama, but that's it: good acting, but nothing extraordinary that would take this film to win the Oscars for best movie and screenplay. Reasonable information documentary type, yes; good movie, no. What we see is just some people scheduling some interviews and asking other people questions to gather information and publish an article. Where's the story in that for a movie? By the way, why does not Hollywood make a movie about 'pedophilia in Hollywood'?"
"""Spotlight"" is the ""All the President's Men"" of a new movie generation.Establishing a journalistic tone that matches the film's setting, it tells the story of a Boston newspaper team's efforts to expose the sexual abuse running rampant throughout the Catholic Church. It's a film with hardly a misstep or false note. Eschewing the histrionics and emotional manipulation that other films would have brought to the same material, ""Spotlight"" understands that the screenplay and actors hired to interpret it are strong enough without any emotional embellishment, and the film is far more powerful because of the understated approach. The entire cast is at top form, with Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, and John Slattery as the standouts (Ruffalo in particular delivers an impassioned soliloquy so emotionally powerful that it nearly brought me to tears), but this is an ensemble film with actors working together like a well-oiled machine, and it seems unfair to single out any one when they're all so good.Director Tom McCarthy is most known for his work to date on the Pixar movies, and you couldn't find a movie further away from the colorful palettes and winsome stories of the Pixar world. But he proves himself a versatile filmmaker, one who knows how to handle extremely varied material. It would be easy to discount the direction of this film, but one should not underestimate how difficult directing a film that consists almost entirely of conversations would be. And when one also considers that part of good directing is getting good performances from actors, McCarthy's goes down as some of the best directing of the year.So far, this and ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" are my two favorite movies of the year. How's that for opposite sides of the movie spectrum?Grade: A+"
"With a movie like Spotlight, the one thing you can say against it is that it's not particularly showy. We won't remember the movie this year let alone years from now for its cinematography (though perhaps its lack of being 'showy' or really darkly lit or stark in contrasts is its own visual statement). This isn't to say that Tom McCarthy doesn't so his job as a director in an elemental sense; he does get some good shots (there's one where the camera simply backs up as a crucial statistic is laid out by the ex-priest turned therapist who gives the Spotlight reporters what they need to move forward into the bigger picture of their story, and it works beautifully). But what he does is put together the best cast possible - Keaton, Ruffalo, John Slattery (as Ben Bradley Jr, which I'll touch on in a moment), Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, Stanley Tucci, Billy Crudup, and even Richard Jenkins as the voice on the phone - and makes sure that they're all on a level where no one ever upstages another. The story is all here.It's a subject that carries with it some exposition - you got to know the facts of this case, and there are times you get a lot of information, not unlike say Law & Order SVU - but it's all in service of a narrative that makes it welcome and exciting. This is about what it means to craft a story and to get it right, but what 'right' even means in the grand scheme of things, which here being the sort of Court of Public Opinion. If you don't get the facts right, or have enough 'deep cover' to back things up, things can be poked through, especially in the context of this story being in Boston and the Catholic church. While pederasty wasn't unheard of in 2001 with the priests and organization in general, it was seen as more-so isolated incidents. The key to Spotlight being so compelling is to draw the viewer in the same way the reporters do: the stakes here are so high.It's easy to compare this to All the President's Men for a number of reasons; one thing I saw as an interesting coincidence was two generations of Ben Bradleys here, with Robards as the Senior in 'Presidents' at the Washington Post and the Junior played by a no-BS Slattery, similar level of sarcasm in the midst of professional talk by the way. What it comes down to is how much do performances and the search for information against a super-powerful institution (one the branches of government and conspiracy of the Executive level, the other an institution that ""thinks in centuries"" as notes in the film) elevate the material? I think just as with the Pakula film, this does it exceptionally well. While it may not have the same sort of effect of that 76 film (no Gordon Willis, as I said it's not a particularly stand-out film as far as the look), Spotlight really has some deep things to address about faith and trust, and it doesn't shy away from making these reporters real people in the midst of their search. Ruffalo and Keaton may stand out the most for people, chiefly as they get (I think, I could be wrong) more impactful screen time as they are each looking for precious information (the former with his connection to Tucci's lawyer, who handles cases involving pedophilia and the church and in the screwed up legal system, the latter with the 'source' he has and his own background growing up in Boston and the Church). But I was very impressed by the screen time being evenly laid out; Ruffalo and Keaton may get the Oscar attention, but Schreiber has a number of remarkable scenes, such as an awkward/polite conversation with Cardinal Law, and McAdams as she knocks on doors and has the most startling scene involving a conversation with a priest who reveals, remarkably, candidly, that he didn't really see what he did as rape (he should know, he says, as he was raped).If you like seeing a cast keeping things grounded and realistic, and yet have moments of powerful drama and conflict that cuts at a lot of corners of society (especially, also, involving class as this is also a class issue involving low-income families having kids who were molested/raped), this is a film to see. It doesn't exactly leave you feeling all that 'good', but it does celebrate what journalism can do in an unfussy, unsentimental way that is refreshing too."
"As we know Spotlight pulled off something of an upset at the 2015 Oscars by winning for Best Picture. It might have not been my first choice, still it is a good film dealing with a most distasteful subject, molestation by Roman Catholic priests of minors.For centuries the priesthood has been a refuge for closeted gay men who were then never questioned about their lack of interest in women. Then along came Stonewall and gay liberation and chances undreamed of for gays to live openly. So there was no longer a need to enter the priesthood. That caused a lot of vacancies and to this day the Catholic Church has never filled all the openings.Secondly celibacy is just one insane requirement. Back 1000 years ago when it was introduced we never knew about libidos and sex drives. For some with low or no sex drive it's no big deal. But some of us have needs. Put it together you have a recipe for pedophilia.Not that this wasn't known. Back in my younger days I knew a family that numbered a priest among a few brothers. This individual while an ordained priest ran for NYS Assembly. But one day we heard he was transferred to a new parish on an Indian reservation in the southwest. That was a favorite dumping ground for priests from the New York Archdiocese who got caught and were in too many parishes. Cardinal Francis J. Spellman's favorite exile place. Maybe Cardinal Bernard Law if he knew about what Spellman did he might have put off what happened to his Archdiocese in Boston. This all started with the expose of one Father John Geoghan who was transferred to many parishes in the Archdiocese after it got out he had a taste for young boys. What the team of investigative reporters from the Boston Globe did was tell the wider story and the film is their search for evidence. The film is always compared with All The President's Men and how the Washington Post broke the Watergate story. One big difference is that a couple of high powered box office names in Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford led the cast. No big names in Spotlight's cast, just a well assembled ensemble. In fact two of the cast Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams were nominated for Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress respectively. You might well ask the question, who were they in support of?Spotlight is a good film, not a great one, but it has a few moments. One that is unforgettable for me is Rachel McAdams on the trail of her story going to the house of a former priest. If there were an award for brief significant performances category than Richard O'Rourke as the defrocked priest would have got it for that year. Watch Rachel's reactions as O'Rourke who is so clearly not emotionally developed starts talking of his experiences. Then he's cut off from McAdams by his sister played by Nancy Carroll who is protective of her child like brother and orders her off the premises. That scene told you a lot about many who went into that vocation.I don't think the great film on the subject has yet been made. But Spotlight will do until it is."
"Wow, just took me to January 1st, 2016 to see my only 10 star film of 2015.This movie is amazing and captivating from the first frame. I was literally that hooked from the second the movie opened. I wanted to know more, see more, learn more. The cast was incredible, believable, real and had wonderful chemistry. In fact, not one moment passed when I didn't feel like I was a part of this real story and sitting alongside all of them. I could go on and on, and will. The story was fascinating, motivating, deep and intriguing. These warriors, these journalists, weren't just doing their job, they 100% believed in it and wanted to correct their own mistakes as well as the countless other demons within the catholic church.This story needed to be told back in the early 2000s, as it does need revisiting now. I know the catholic church truly wanted to sweep this under the rug once (or make that for DECADES,) but they also wanted their poor decisions, to put it mildly, to be forgotten in the years following. It shouldn't. Their horrendous crimes and cover-ups should never be removed from our memory. Forever, the church should be remembered for their terrible sins.Guess it helps I'm not catholic. And I might be getting a little emotional. The movie, about the Boston Globe's small Spotlight investigation team unraveling decades of deceit within the catholic church in which they were hiding/relocating pedophiles, was so great and wonderfully simple on so many levels. From acting to direction to pacingthat alone usually irks me, but not once in the over two hour runtime was I not on the edge of my seat. That says a lot about a movie that has no action or high Hollywood dramatic scenes. (Well, there was one speech by the fantastic Mark Ruffalo and I envisioned that scene being shown at the Oscars for his inevitable nomination, but it didn't feel fake or forced.)From a cinema lover's viewpoint, this should be seen on how much they got right. From the normal audience's POV, it should be seen to remind us: if the big entity (the church) did it once, watch for it again, if not currently. And from the victim's corner, they should cherish these heroes as the surviving Holocaust members and family viewed Schindler's List. * * *Final thoughts: On a personal level, it helps I love actual newspaper/investigating movies. Another one of my favorites also starred the brilliant Michael Keaton: The Paper. I already miss these days when real journalism happened not just 98% of the internet crap. So, that all said, this movie might be slow to most people (hell, they showed the extent of the ""inter-net"" back in 2001 with a full billboard in the Boston Globe's own parking lot for AOL) but to me, to see real people doing real journalism was and always will be fascinating to me."
"Having recently read Goodbye Good Men by Michael S. Rose -- which goes into excruciating detail about homosexuality in the Roman Catholic seminaries during the Sexual Revolution of the 60s and 70s, which inevitably led to the ordination of sexual deviants -- 6% according to the film, the pedophile priest scandal was a dreadful accident waiting to happen. Church authorities were indeed negligent and chose to engage in the massive cover-up, and the Globe's expose did some good. Catholic-bashers (both Christian and otherwise) gloated with glee when the story hit (and kept on hitting).However, there were numerous other reports of pervert rabbis preying on school children which also were swept under the rug with the complicit assistance of newspapers. And also buried deep in the Metro section on page E-7 was the massive abuse committed nationwide by secular teachers both male and female. I'm sure the advocates of the ""do your own thing,"" and ""if it feels good"" movements who preach tolerance of wickedness and evil, and those who define deviancy down won't like this comment, but that's the breaks. Deal with it!"
"By no means movies awarded the best movie academy award are the best out there. That's for sure. Neither Miss Universe is the ""most beautiful woman in the world"" etc.I will probably fail to remember which movies won the Oscar the last 3 decades. Some of them are totally forgettable and makes you wonder if they were deserving a nomination in the first place. In my opinion ""the best picture of the year"" should be a game changing movie, that leaves you speechless while you are watching it and make a permanent imprint in your mind and soul.Spotlight won the Oscar for the best movie of 2016. Was it worth it? In my opinion faaaar from it. Was it a bad movie? Of course not. But it is far from being great. It has adequate performances from the well known leads. A bright photography, which for me is always a plus, but...Of course the premise touches a sensitive subject but it doesn't make an impact to the audience. You will hear: the number is not 13 it's more than that like 20 or even 90, and that is supposed to have an impact to the viewers, about the scale of child molestation from priests and a possible church cover-up, but it really hasn't. You hear 2-3 testimonies but you don't see the act, not even in the form of a flashback. So, for that, it is not effective.I read some reviews praising how ""controlled"" this movie is. In my opinion that was a mistake for that subject. The testimonies weren't enough to draw a picture about the problem. Also there is no actual heroes here. The reporters just doing their work and the paper had the opportunity to do something years ago but let it slide.Overall: I cannot understand how this movie is considered as the best of 2016. It is a mild ride. No surprises no heroes. A little bit on the boring side in its 2 hours 7 minutes duration. Nothing extraordinary. Just adequate as a film and far less than that as a statement against a serious problem of our societies."
"Yet another film with big name actors playing journalists. Same clichés in far superior films such as All The President's Men (ATPM); everything that worked in that film did not work for this one (IMHO). The only two characters that didn't annoy me were played by Tucci and Schriever (sp). I see this material and subject better suited as a documentary piece on Dateline and 20/20. If it had to be a film then I think casting lesser/unknown actors would deliver more of an impact and remove the preconceived notions and biases of the bigger names involved here. Ron Slattery is an old hat at playing the upper management type and is no different here..Michael Keaton plays another manager who gets to sit in an office (did they really need him to do this?). Rachel McAdams gets another shot at being a serious reporter (State of Play) while being stripped of the charm and freshness she brought in Wedding Crashers, Morning Glory. We are treated to Mark Ruffalo running to the office (deep, riveting stuff). Then we get to watch him in the waiting room of a law office until he takes initiative to talk to the lawyer (another reference to ATPM). To me it distracts from a really important subject and has Hollywood stamped all over it. Best Picture? Something tells me it was a foregone conclusion that when this was released it would be nominated, regardless of merit."
"Note that this movie will get less than 10 stars because Catholics will vote it down to minimize getting the truth out. The movie shows how hard Catholics try to hide the truth.The movie (and actors) do a great job of telling the story of Boston, and the influence and awesome power the Catholic church once had in the city.It then shows how they tried, in 100% of cases, to hide and move known pedophile priests, and they knew about it.One thing they don't mention is that this is enabled by something called ""Catholic confession"", in which a priest can confess his child rape to another and get completely forgiven in 15 minutes (in defiance of Jesus in Matt 18:6, by the way).However, now the new priest that heard the confession knows he can get away with it. This caused pedophilia to run rampant through Boston and the Catholic church, where there were at least 249 known pedophile priests, and over 1,000 victims.However, there were probably at least 1,000 priests that heard these ""confessions"" each time any of the 249 raped a child, so the institution knew, and still does and hides it today.It is chilling to hear the interview with Fr Pacquin, who readily admits to the Globe that he molested a bunch of children, as if it was no big deal because all the other priests were doing it, too.The movie shows how hard it was to get the truth out of the Catholic church, which intentionally protected these pedophiles, moving them to new locations where their evil wouldn't be known, never warning the new community, and sometimes not even warning the leaders.This pedophile protection came from the top, from Cardinal Law, and was passed throughout the hierarchy, which worked like the Nazis, just doing what they were told, despite Jesus in Matt 18:6-14.You can feel the awesome power of the Catholic church, which they use at every opportunity to get away with evil, and never to help children. The characters in the movie are sickened by the truth, and the intention of the organization to protect every child rapist, with no regard for the victims.This is an organized crime movie."
"Having watched this on a plane, and not fully finishing it (and missing some parts because I was nodding off), this review is based on my impression of the parts that I did watch. Based on a true story, Spotlight does well at giving a pragmatic account of what actually happened. I'm not very sure at which part I stopped watching (and which parts I missed) but from what I saw, the progression of the film seemed to take a while. Also, because it dealt with an industry I don't know much about, most of the technical talk went over my head.I mean it's great that they're bringing this story to light, but I was not following along that well. The cast did a good job at playing their characters though, and it was great to see A-list actors playing characters outside their typical roles. As well, the mise-en-scene did well in setting the atmosphere of the movie."
"It's not that this isn't a star-studded gripping movie about an important subject. It just wasn't best picture to me (for which it won an Academy Award, along with best screenplay). For that it played it far too safely. Much of the movie reminded me of the 1994 ""The Paper"", also headlined by Michael Keaton.In a way, The Paper was better because it was entirely fictional and therefore could go all-out. ""Spotlight"" (named after the editorial crew of the Boston Globe that uncovered the scandal) kinda had to try to fit the facts. For example, the journalists seemed to do relatively little uncovering themselves, for that they relied heavily on attorneys, experts and interest groups, and at times they even blocked the investigation. Boston is described as a type of mafia territory where you can't escape the Catholic church, except for when you're Jewish or Armenian. That seemed a pretty shallow explanation.Rachel McAdams didn't seemed too much of a Hollywood blonde to fit into the newspaper. Have you ever seen newspaper journalists? There's a reason they don't work in front of the camera.For me, I'd rather have a great movie about a trifling subject than a good movie about an important subject. Because I don't like being schooled by mother."
"I wanted to like ""Spotlight."" The epidemic of sexual abuse in Catholic parishes deserves all of the attention it can get, but the execution of this film just simply did not cut the mustard. Those extolling the virtues of this film, and clamoring for Oscar nods, seem blind to just how ill-conceived the story is. The leads were one-dimensional; sure, they wanted to break the story of sexual abuse within the Catholic diocese in Boston, but there was never any sense of dilemma, conflicting desires, or backstory which could provide a stronger motivation for the goal. Everything was straightforward and on the nose. The characters had a deliberate way of of speaking, and a deliberate interest in breaking the sex abuse scandal, but their motivation was entirely unclear. I suppose we ought to just believe that journalistic integrity dictates that any crime or scandal must be broken to the world, but there was never any appreciation for the dilemma of the characters or the stakes they faced. Basically, the stakes were as follows: if we break this story, the Catholic church might be mad at us. Those could very well have been the stakes in the actual, real-life story, but they don't make for good cinema. A strong cinematic dilemma might be that one of the journalists is a personal friend of one of the abusive priests, and thus is faced with the conflict of doing the right thing versus protecting his/her dear friend. Or, perhaps by breaking the story, the journalists are jeopardizing their own physical well-being. Again, adding such dilemmas might be violating the veracity of the story, but it's a film, and if the drama and the dilemma aren't there, then maybe a documentary or non-fiction book are a better means of telling the story. The war epic, ""Gladiator,"" is hardly historically accurate - Marcus Aurelius was not murdered by his son Commodus (the driving force behind the film's revenge plot) - but it makes for great cinema. In the same vein as murky character motivations, is the problem of obstacles. There was not a strong source of antagonism behind preventing the scandal from being released. The writer of ""Spotlight"" could have written the Catholic church as a more menacing and formidable force. I was never concerned that our hero journalists would fail in their mission. And more importantly, I was never worried that the truth would continue to be obfuscated by the Church. The writer could have expanded the Cardinal Law character into an active enemy of truth, and someone whose cunning and entitlement is sickening. The Cardinal Law character could have been as menacing and nuanced as Noah Cross in ""Chinatown."" In fact, ""Chinatown"" is a great example of everything that is missing in ""Spotlight."" If you recall the line in Polanski's magnum opus, when Cross says to Gittes: ""You may think you know what you're dealing with, but, believe me, you don't."" In that scene, the audience truly feels the gravity of the moment, and the truth that Gittes is embarking on something bigger than himself, and that he should tread softly. Another point about this story, and it may be the biggest point, is the medium. Every story has an appropriate medium for telling. The Catcher in the Rye, for instance, does not lend itself to a cinematic retelling, to say nothing of Salinger's steadfast refusal to sell the book rights. Likewise, ""Spotlight"" is not a story that is best told through a visual medium. There is just simply not enough action. Each scene in the film consists of characters talking to each other, hoping to gain new information. While this can work in films where the dialogue is an art form in-and-of itself, it is not the case in ""Spotlight."" The dialogue and characterization was not nearly strong enough."
"In 2001, the Jewish editor Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) is hired by The Boston Globe and he asks the Spotlight team to investigate the priest John Geoghan that was accused of abusing children and the lawyer Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci) that has told that Cardinal Law (Len Cariou) knew what his priest did. Walter 'Robby' Robinson (Michael Keaton), Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams) and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James) are fully supported by Baron and their leader Ben Bradlee, Jr. (John Slattery) to set in motion the investigation of the priest and they contact the initially reluctant Garabedian; the lawyer Eric Macleish (Billy Crudup) that has defended many victims; the leader of the victims' rights organization Phil Saviano (Neal Huff); and several victims that accept to meet them. After one year investigation, they confirm the names of twenty pedophile priest in Boston and they publish the story showing that Cardinal Law had prior knowledge of the priests' abuse of children.""Spotlight"" is based on a true story about the infamous Boston scandal when dark secrets of the Catholic Church were disclosed forcing the church to take responsibility for the shameful acts of some of their priests. The story stops with the publication of the scandal with names and other victims contacting the newspaper team. The screenplay, direction and performances are top-notch. Just as curiosity, the following link (http://www.historyvshollywood.com/reelfaces/spotlight/) shows the real face of several ""Spotlight"" characters. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Spotlight: Segredos Revelados"" (""Spotlight: Secrets Disclosed"")"
"For me this film was beautifully tragic; by this I mean it was a fantastically acted film and gripping; but I'm disgusted and mortified that it actually happened.It was good that the film focused on how the conspiracy into the abuse was covered up; for me it was a preference than focusing on the victims and bringing any more agony to them. It brought a tear to my eye to know the depths that this went on (and probably still does) and the number of victims that were involved. As someone who has a criminology degree with a focus on child abuse this film was particularly poignant. I was appalled at the end to see that the cardinal for Boston was moved to a high ranked job in the Vatican; when it was clear from scenes and evidence brought up in the film that he was aware. The end provides a list of places where it has been uncovered; this is heartbreaking. Mark Ruffalo was fantastic in this film, however, for me the stand it performance was from Michael Keaton as the 'Spotlight' team editor. For me it was first 10/10 of the year (2016)"
"Despite the quality of this film, the disturbingly tragic topic makes this film hard to watch. The ensemble cast is brilliant and the pacing kept a somewhat complicated and slow story very interesting. It's hard to make people talking on the phone and collating data exciting but Tom McCarthy pulled it off though he usual fare is comedy. This is one of the best films of the year and an important one.In a crowded film, Mark Ruffalo stood out as Mike Rezendes, the intrepid reporter who hassled the lawyer of several abuse victims Mitchell Garabedian played by a somber Stanley Tucci. Ruffalo did a great job getting into character and distancing himself from his more popular role as the Incredible Hulk. A speech he gives at the end is one of the most moving in the film. Michael Keaton as delivered a strong performance as the conflicted Boston native Walter Robinson. He didn't match his award snubbed performance in Birdman but he nailed the Boston accent and the emotional turmoil the investigation caused.For more of this review and others, check out swilliky.com"
"You spotlight up my life, you give me hope, to carry on... Sorry to get all Debbie Booneish on you in my intro on my review of the spectacular movie ""Spotlight"". Director Tom McCarthy's movie about the true story of how the Boston Globe uncovered the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese is shaking up to the be the frontrunner of the Best Picture Oscar, and why not? McCarthy's meticulous direction of the film and his layering of its expose was a sermonial, I mean a ceremonial piece of mastery. The Boston Globe's investigative ""Spotlight"" department shined on unveiling this disturbing truth. What was not disturbing was the exemplary acting performances from the actors playing the ""spotlight"" write players; including Mark Ruffalo as the emotional Mike Rezendes, Rachel McAdams as the conflicted Sacha Pfeiffer, Brian D'arcy James as the cerebral Matt Carroll, and the ""Birdman"" himself Michael Keaton as the group's leader Robby Robinson. Keaton and Ruffalo were the standouts here, but all should be given the proper spotlight for their commendable acting. Other fine thespian turns came from Stanley Tucci as the counsel Mitchell Garadebian, Liev Schrieber as the paper's new editor Marty Baron, and John Slattery as the associate editor Ben Bradlee. It will be very sad if this acting group does not get the SAG Best Acting Ensemble Award. McCarthy's script with fellow screenplayer Josh Singer had all of the write stuff of a multi- dimensional narrative covering an uncomfortable subject matter. Sure, the film does depict journalists as literary superheroes, but their procedural process workings was their greatest weapon to get rid of the darkness of the subject they were investigating; and it isn't that what superheroes do? or something like that? Anyways, I pray that ""Spotlight' receives many Oscar nominations, as it should. So, it's now time for you to see and then share the ""Spotlight"". ***** Excellent"
"I really wanted to enjoy this film, as I knew the true story behind it. I just felt it wasn't told properly, or could have been told better via its screenplay.Don't get me wrong, it was a great cast, but some of the performances felt flat at times, and again, I blame it on the screenplay and/or the direction.The pace also felt very slow and although 2 hrs and 8 mins aren't abnormal for a movie, this one felt like it was over 3 hours.Still an enjoyable viewing, but had it been tweaked a little better (editing dept?), I may have enjoyed it more.It's a 7/10 from me."
"Spotlight is one of the best movie I have ever watched. All the characters played by the actors are awesome. It feels like you are not watching a movie, but it's happening around you. Mark Ruffalo is a superstar. He has very good acting skills. No doubt everybody has given their 100%.So realistic, I must say everybody must watch this movie before they die.Sudden changes in journalists life after joining of new editor. Handled such a delicate subject in a very good way.And finally truth wins over."
"This revealing drama is directed by Tom McCarthy, who also co-wrote with Josh Singer. Winning the Best Picture Oscar brings about much debate. The two hours plus film at times lumbers, but is saved with talented acting. A team of crack Boston Globe reporters spend the best part of a year to reveal a string of cover-ups that goes back decades that exposes the Catholic Archdiocese history keeping to be very relaxed and void of child molestation reports and dozens upon dozens of hidden or overlooked complaints of clergy-initiated abuses. Many whistles may have blown, but went ignored being heard.A tremendously talented cast made SPOTLIGHT award worthy: Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Michael Keaton, Liev Schreiber, Elana Wohl, Paul Guilfoyle, Stanley Tucci, Jamey Sheridan and Billy Crudup."
"By coincidence I watched this film only a week after listening to the editor in chief of Huffington Post UK say that authentic writing cannot come from paid journalists, which is why they do not pay their writers (although Adriana Huffington seemed fine with the millions she got when she sold the website). This stuck in my mind when watching this very fine drama about how the Boston Globe reporters uncovered and exposed a mass cover-up of abuse within the Catholic Church. Also in my mind was a sense of disbelief that this true story is not too much more than a decade old – the mass abuse of children by Catholic Priests now just seems such a known thing now that it is hard to imagine a time when it wasn't.Perhaps because this is so well known, the film is compelling because it focuses on the story of the story, focusing on the journalism. This gives the film the challenge that in terms of action it is mostly people typing, people on the phone, and lots of talking. This it manages really well, building a compelling but robust drama that builds well and takes the viewer along with it. The subject matter means that the emotional side is not left behind either, and the film deftly reminds us of the people (not just the facts) in ways that are natural and integrated, not sentimental or manipulative.McCarthy directs with professional control, and standards are high – mostly noticeably in the casting. It is not easy to point out one lead, because so many famous faces are here, and all of them do their job in a way that integrates with the rest – there are no really showing moments, no moments where you feel someone is pushing for an Oscar; it is a real ensemble piece, with too many good turns to start to name them all. The end result is that strong writing, and respect for the process of journalism, combines with the importance of the true story and the strong delivery of all aspects to produce an engaging story which carries emotional and professional weight."
"Great films create a compelling connection to the actors and characters. You care about them as individuals and you come to love, hate or relate to their quest. Spotlight does not really deliver on this. It is a good film, and it tells an important story with an important message about the fourth estate. Well, actually, the film is also largely about the flaws of the first estate, second estate, and third estate, but the fourth estate (the press) is the one that rebounds from its flaws. This methodical telling of a true story about the importance of a vigilant press is rated highly by critics this year. It is a story about how the press, politicians and religious leaders all conspired to protect a terrible group of people. This is an important story in that we must prevent this from ever happening again by any people in our society. But the importance of the story itself is not how you rate a film. This film is well crafted, well acted and very well cast. But its mission is quite methodical and we gain few emotional insights about the key protagonists. The film deserves much praise in that it may help teach us to never be silent again when dark and evil behavior in among us. The mission to end this evil is important and for that reason, it is an important film to see. We can hope this film helps prevent future wrongdoing and helps people to speak out when they see things that are truly wrong. It is a very well-crafted film with an important message. The message may be more important than the film itself."
"Everyone needs to see Spotlight. The writing, direction and acting are all flawless. The story is totally engrossing.I never quite 'got' why the courts and the media are now going after the Catholic Church hierarchy, rather than going after the pedophile priests. This movie answers that question.What it doesn't answer is why the Church hierarchy didn't just de- frock the pedophile priests, rather than move them from parish to parish. Kicking them out would have STOPPED the abuse rather than just MANAGING the abuse. It would have sent a message to other pedophile priests and actually done something to fix the problem rather than perpetuate it. The other question I have is this: the vast majority of people in all churches and all religions are good people, doing good work with good intentions. How could Catholic Church hierarchy have allowed the pedophile priests to remain in the Church when they knew that children were being abused. How could they have allowed the children. How?"
"Storytelling takes many forms and mediums and as much as I enjoyed 'Spotlight', it could have been presented better by way of Documentary as opposed to the traditional 'Hollywood' storytelling narrative. Now being a fan of Documentaries, I tend to also enjoy films that fall into the category of 'based on actual events'. I know sometimes 'Hollywood' gets in the way of presenting a factual story but as great as the performances were from all leading cast members, I found that the characters were weak and overshadowed by the star power that took them on. Clearly it was the punchy script that attracted the leading names because none of the characters had any real depth and really don't stand out as a role that an actor would 'just have to play'. Keating, McAdams, Ruffalo and Tucci were all great in the portrayal of real people - This was definitely Ruffalo's film. I get it though... This isn't a film about characters. It's a film about journalistic investigation (Hence why a documentary film may have been a better approach to tell this story). Hearing the word's come from those individuals who worked tirelessly to blow the lid off the Catholic Church in interview style would have made for a more gripping narrative. Spotlight just doesn't have the excitement that came with films like Argo or Erin Brockovich. Was it the director's choice to simply keep the characters two dimensional in order for the investigative journalism to shine through? If so, mission accomplished and well done. However, was the journalistic investigation interesting enough to warrant a 'Hollywood' story - I'm not sure. I was thirsty to know more about the characters motivations for pursuing this story. I was expecting a hardline connection by the Boston Globe to the Catholic Church in order to give that 'Ah-ha' moment that just never came. I was waiting for that 'Hollywood' moment that told the audience that this is why it warrants the storytelling narrative. I wanted an 'Erin Brockovich' and all I got was everyday 'John Smith'.What I did enjoy about this film is it's visual tone and production design. I enjoy seeking out time and place in regards to era based on the production design elements. The colours, lighting and depictions of the environment both internal and external were en pointe. Natural tones, Light makeup, non saturated colours assist to translate this as real life events - Well done.All in all, this is a solid drama, well written with good honest dialogue between the players. Tom McCarthy has done an exceptional job with both the written word and direction. But traditionally we like our protagonists with a healthy does of antagonist, in this instance the catholic church was the antagonist, yet their presence wasn't really felt. They didn't come across as the 'big bad', there was no power struggle, the cover up was just spoken of without being shown. Even the victims stories didn't seem to have that vital punch to help drive home the message of evil. Our protagonist are a vital ingredient to the film recipe and here it was missing altogether. And finally, a little side note that always seems to 'erk' me with films that are 'Based on Actual Events' and thats the text based epilogue, commenting on what has happened in closing - For me, this is somewhat of a cop-out from film makers. As an audience member, I want my payoff, I want my finale and I want to see it brought to life by the characters I've just invested the last two hours in - I wanted to see the Catholic Church go down for those heinous acts. If I wanted to read about it, I would have written to the Boston Globe and asked for a copy of the story.In this instance, I yearned for Hollywood to get in the way of a factual story. Deserving of a supporting actor nod for Ruffalo and a writing nod for McCarthy - but best picture? Nope - I'm not sold."
"Chances are Spotlight will walk home with Best Picture of The Year at the Oscars. I'm calling it now. I was very excited to see it because I love Michael Keaton and last year's Birdman was so bizarre. Plus this seemed to be the type of film that could only be great with a great cast and an incredible, disturbing and important subject matter. Spotlight is fascinating. It's at least as good as Trumbo was but the problem with this and Trumbo is that both films were just good. Spotlight is based on the horrifying story of a team of reporters at the Boston Globe who single handedly uncover one of the biggest cover-ups in history of sexual abuse within the Catholic Church. It's interesting, it's well acted but it's far from great. The pace is good, nothing gets in the way of the main story and there are strong performances from an ensemble cast. No one really ""stars"" in the film but rather everyone works at driving the important story. I felt like from an entertainment perspective it wasn't necessarily thrilling but it does tell the story decently. To me a Best Picture nominee should have all their ducks in a row and Spotlight doesn't really fit that bill for me being just ""good."" Their is no real ""star"" in Spotlight because it's an ensemble cast. And despite the big names, no one really stands out because it's not a character driven story really. Still Michael Keaton (who has always been a favourite of mine) brings his usual style and chemistry to the picture and helps properly guide it. I think he gives the best performance even if it is subtle. Rachel McAdams is fantastic in general. I always enjoy her but her performance in this is barely existent and the fact she got an Oscar nomination seems ludicrous. But we all know this can be the case with Oscars. She is background character in this film. Mark Ruffalo is decent and shows a lot of emotion compared to some other characters. Liev Schrieber is also good but a role that is far too small much like Ruffalo's. John Slattery is always a good addition for a character actor but once again, too small of a role. Honestly, everyone else is even smaller roles including Stanley Tucci and Billy Crudup who could have used more screen time. I think the film could have been far more effective if some of the major players have been given more development.It's hard to speak bad of a film that has received so many nominations and is the favourite it win the Best Picture Oscar but I feel like so far the nominations I've seen this year have been sub-par with the exception of Mad Max. I tend to think there is usually some great gems on the Best Picture list but Spotlight doesn't fill those shoes. Tom McCarthy isn't a well versed director and his previous film was one of the most made-fun of (Adam Sandler's The Cobbler) so how did he end up directing this and why does everything think it's ""so great?"" I mean Spotlight was good, it's a very important story but a ""great picture?"" No not even close. I don't know what the critics see in it but Spotlight is average and watchable but won't floor anyone, it certainly didn't floor me. 7/10"
"Spotlight, in this guys' humble opinion, was a good movie that never quite made it to 'great.' I completely missed what the hype machine has dubbed for Rachel McAdams. Her character and performance was serviceable, but standard. Ruffalo was quite good.My main issue with the film was that I never felt any real danger or tension. Where a film like All The President's Men succeeds (a clear compatible film) is in a palpable sense of danger. In Spotlight, the main dramatic tension came from making sure The Herald wasn't going to get some unsealed documents first(?). Honestly... who the f**k reads The Herald?Anyway... The unraveling of the bigger picture wasn't as compelling as I wanted it to be. I so desperately was rooting for this movie, because the 70's style cinema brand of talking and sitting (pre-Sorkin cinematic evolutionary 'walk and talk') is right up my alley. My favorite films employ this kind of human story-no big set pieces-just actors being great with great writing... But something was missing. No mystery. The end as obvious from the first frame as from the middle one, as from the last. I wish I was moved."
"When the story broke about the systemic abuse in the Catholic Church between the members of the Clergy and children in their care and the cover up that followed it was world breaking stuff. It rightly shock the church to its core. Social Media made this possible and the cover up impossible to continue, one of the places where this started was the Boston Globe, who started investigating the story with its 'Spotlight' team, a group within the paper that investigate special interest stories. Led by Walter Robinson (Michael Keaton, first rate here as always) his small team take on the task full time only to have it temporarily delayed by the events of 9 / 11. But Robinson and his team are persistent and the more bureaucracy they come up against that seems determined to sweep things under the rug the more persistent they get until the bough breaks and final the cradle falls, leading to law suits world wide through out the church.Cinema was made for films like these, not only is this film damn good, its probably one of the most important films to be made of the last decade and if its overlooked at the Oscars this will be nothing short of criminal. All the cast are first rate here and entirely convincing, from Rachel McAdams as the caring reporter with a heart, to Stanley Tucci's diligent yet suspicious lawyer whose all too aware of how fickle the loyalty of a reporter can be. Jamey Sheridan and Billy Crudup are just the right side of bent but it is Mark Ruffalo in his portrayal of reporter Mike Rezendes who take the acting honors here. His impassioned outburst must have resonated with many victims who were brave enough to watch the film when he cries out 'Why not now, what are we waiting for? We have to nail these bastards.' - Never before has a greater crime been committed against such a large number of innocent minors and all in the same of God. Watching the film makes me feel that the Church world wide should pay back every cent to the hell they put those people through. This film is not only demanding and rightly draining, it is vital viewing. Director Tom McCarthy should be proud of himself, because I know I am proud of him and writer Josh Singer, for bringing a project which was blacklisted, with a first rate script and cast to the screen."
"There was a lot of buzz surrounding Spotlight when it first premiered at the film festivals. Many were comparing it to All the President's Men, saying it was just about on par with that one. I had only recently seen All the President's Men and had high expectation for this movie if it was true that it was just as good. I'm ecstatic to report that this movie not only lived up to the hype, but exceeded it to emerge as one of the year's best films.Spotlight was built to stand the test of time with its true to life, edge-of-you-seat style drama. The story follows the journalists in the Spotlight department of the Boston Globe who broke the story about the molestation charges against Priests that had gone on unnoticed for some time. The story itself is engaging to start with but the screenplay, direction, and acting all come together flawlessly to create an incredibly powerful and emotional film. By the time the end credits roll, the film has landed such a powerful and lingering punch that the events portrayed almost seem surreal. This is most definitely a film that will not be forgotten soon.The acting is top-notch with everyone from Michael Keaton to Mark Ruffalo to Rachel McAdams giving possibly the performances of their careers, respectively. This is one of the best ensembles of the year. Even those who didn't have as much screen-time like Liev Schriber, Stanler Tucci, and John Slattery shine when their time is given.Overall, Spotlight is an exceptional film that will most likely receive some major nominations come awards season. The leading and supporting cast all bring their A games as well as director Tom McCarthy. This is a movie you most definitely do not want to miss.""It takes a village to raise them. It takes a village to abuse them. That's the truth of it."""
"Spotlight has two main things going for it. A very strong script from Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer that is reminiscent of All The President's Men and the stellar cast made up of Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, Mark Ruffalo, Stanley Tucci, John Slattery and Brian d'Arcy James. But besides all of those 2 great aspects, does Spotlight present itself as the film that deserves the slew of award nominations that it has been slammed with? To me, no.Spotlight seems to be a movie that shows itself as an amazing film but lacks focus on characters and doesn't stretch boundaries for cinema. Does that mean all that praise isn't in the film? No, Spotlight does shine brightly in the script and performances.Spotlight is based on the true story of the Boston Globe reporters in the Spotlight section that are tasked with finding evidence for a story on the Catholic Church child molestation cases but discover something bigger in the process. The 128 minute film follows the reporters as they come across the victims of these molestations. While others will say Michael Keaton is the standout in this film for me it's Mark Ruffalo giving my personal favorite performance from him. Stanley Tucci, Liev Schreiber, Rachel McAdams and Brian d'Arcy James give great performances that help give the film a bit more shape but sadly it doesn't help that their characters and how they're shown to us are the root of my problem with Spotlight. Spotlight's characters are never given much detail so we don't really feel a personal connection with the reporters like we should because they're the main characters.The writing in Spotlight is great and definitely deserving of the awards it gets. While the characters are written from a bird's eye view it at least gets us to sympathize with the characters and get us invested in how they discover the conspiracy, I wish the directing were the same. Tom McCarthy is a director that hasn't been able to wow me. This is probably because the last film I saw him direct was The Cobbler, one of the worst films of 2015, and he did the opposite of intrigued me and more or less had me rock in the fetal position and think about the choices I have made in my life. He does an adequate job for a biopic. It's really hard to get me to love a biopic nowadays because they all follow the same movements and never fascinate me. A minor nitpick is that each time something important happens in the movie a few notes from the piano played and it was cute the first time but really made me question as to why that had to be the go to music for those moments.Spotlight is just another Oscar baity film (a term I hate using but is definitely true in this case) that has a great script with decent direction and outstanding performances from Keaton and Ruffalo. But the lack of depth in the characters just astounds me. Easily could have been directed better if Spielberg had taken helm. I would definitely recommend to watch but not deserving of Best Picture in my mind. It's definitely a great film that should be shown to people who want more info on the scandal."
"After seeing all of the best picture nominees this year, I have to say this is my least favorite. It's a good movie, that's for sure, but I wasn't really blown away by it.This movie is incredibly well written and especially acted (I want to point out Mark Rufallo and Liev Schreiber) and the story was very interesting. But still, when I finished watching the movie, I just didn't have that special feeling I get when I watch a great movie. It's not boring at all and it's not afraid to go into details, it's very realistic and sometimes it even feels like you are watching something real happen. This did happen and at some parts you really feel like you are watching that and not the movie and also some parts are really messed up. It's never shown, bit you are shocked just by characters talking about it which is great. But I just didn't find myself so invested in the story.It's a very well done movie, but to me it feels like something is missing and till the end of the movie, I wasn't that interested anymore, but I think many people will like this movie."
