Reviews
"One of the early scenes in ""Pulp Fiction"" features two hit-men discussing what a Big Mac is called in other countries. Their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and it's also disarming, because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. If you didn't know better, you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that matter. Yet without such scenes, ""Pulp Fiction"" wouldn't be ""Pulp Fiction."" I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured.It's no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than Tarantino probably intended. The film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you won't pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. But there is no deeper explanation. ""Pulp Fiction,"" is, as the title indicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. Containing numerous references to other films, it is like a great work of abstract art, or ""art about art."" It has all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the most well-constructed narratives I've ever seen in a film. But to what end? The self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself.The movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it's essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. Tarantino's originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments.Perhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. Indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. No character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could have simply told Yolanda, ""Be cool and no one's going to get hurt,"" which is just the type of line you'd find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. Instead, he goes off on a tangent about what Fonzie is like. Tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references. But the lines aren't just witty; they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior. Think of Mia's statement to Vincent, ""That's when you know you've found somebody special: when you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence.""What is the movie's purpose exactly? I'm not sure, but it does deal a lot with the theme of power. Marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time. The whole point of the big date sequence, which happens to be my favorite section of the film, is the power that Marsellus has over his men without even being present. This power is what gets Vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb, stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away. The power theme also helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film, its liberal use of the N-word. In this film, the word isn't just used as an epithet to describe blacks: Jules, for instance, at one point applies the term to Vincent. It has more to do with power than with race. The powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters. Most of these gangsters are not racist in practice. Indeed, they are intermingled racially, and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses the habits of many law-abiding citizens in our society. They resort to racial epithets because it's a patter that establishes their separateness from the non-criminal world.There's a nice moral progression to the stories. We presume that Vincent hesitates to sleep with Mia out of fear rather than loyalty. Later, Butch's act of heroism could be motivated by honor, but we're never sure. The film ends, however, with Jules making a clear moral choice. Thus, the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for self-preservation.Still, it's hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories. None of the stories are really ""about"" anything. They certainly are not about hit-men pontificating about burgers. Nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it contains elements of both. At times, it feels like a tale that didn't need to be told, but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind, or of any other kind."
"I can only speak for myself, but I had never seen anything as stylish, cleverly constructed, well written and electrifying as this milestone when I first saw it in 1994. What really pulled me in right from the start is what we've now come to know as a Tarantino trademark: the dialogue. When gangsters Jules and Vincent talk to each other (or all the other characters, for that matter) there is a natural flow, a sense of realism and yet something slightly over the top and very theatrical about their lines – it's a mixture that immediately grabs your attention (even if it's just two dudes talking about what kind of hamburger they prefer, or contemplating the value of a foot-massage). Then there's the music: the songs Tarantino chose for his masterpiece fit their respective scenes so perfectly that most of those pieces of music are now immediately associated with 'Pulp Fiction'. And the narrative: the different story lines that come together, the elegantly used flashbacks, the use of ""chapters"" – there is so much playful creativity at play here, it's just a pure joy to watch.If you're a bit of a film geek, you realize how much knowledge about film and love for the work of other greats – and inspiration from them - went into this (Leone, DePalma, Scorsese and, of course, dozens of hyper-stylized Asian gangster flicks), but to those accusing Tarantino of copying or even ""stealing"" from other film-makers I can only say: There has never been an artist who adored his kind of art that was NOT inspired or influenced by his favorite artists. And if you watch Tarantino's masterpiece today, it's impossible not to recognize just what a breath of fresh air it was (still is, actually). Somehow, movies - especially gangster films - never looked quite the same after 'Pulp Fiction'. Probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, it's got simply everything: amazing performances (especially Sam Jackson); it features some of the most sizzling, iconic dialogue ever written; it has arguably one of the best non-original soundtracks ever - it's such a crazy, cool, inspirational ride that you feel dizzy after watching it for the first time. It's – well: it's 'Pulp Fiction'. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
"To put this in context, I am 34 years old and I have to say that this is the best film I have seen without doubt and I don't expect it will be beaten as far as I am concerned. Obviously times move on, and I acknowledge that due to its violence and one particularly uncomfortable scene this film is not for everyone, but I still remember watching it for the first time, and it blew me away. Anyone who watches it now has to remember that it actually changed the history of cinema. In context- it followed a decade or more of action films that always ended with a chase sequence where the hero saved the day - you could have written those films yourself. Pulp had you gripped and credited the audience with intelligence. There is not a line of wasted dialogue and the movie incorporates a number of complexities that are not immediately obvious. It also resurrected the career of Grease icon John Travolta and highlighted the acting talent of Samuel L Jackson. There are many films now that are edited out of sequence and have multiple plots etc but this is the one they all want to be, or all want to beat, but never will."
"If you think ""Pulp Fiction"" is brilliant, you're wrong. It's more than that. It's a milestone in the history of film making. It's already a classic. But why? Because of the many ""f"" words, or maybe because of the brain and skull pieces on the rear window of a car? No, that's surely not the point (unfortunately some other users - fortunately the minority - don't get it). Tarantino has made a movie that's someway different from many other action, gangster or crime movies. What's so different? He knows the subject of the movie is ""cool"", he knows it's a product of mass culture, and he even likes it by himself. But he smiles at it and tells three great stories with a lot of irony. And this irony is the first point. The second point is that he gave souls to extremely schematic characters. They surely aren't another action heroes who you forget as fast as you can twinkle. They are human beings like we are, talking about Burger King and McDonalds, about TV series and a foot massage. They just earn their money with killing others or selling drugs. What else is so great about ""Pulp Fiction""? It's the acting, the directing, the cinematography, the soundtrack, the sense of humour and the whole rest. In my opinion it's all worth nothing less than a 10 out of 10. A masterpiece."
"Viewers are taken on a ride through three different stories that entertwine together around the world of Marcellus Wallace. Quentin Tarantino proves that he is the master of witty dialogue and a fast plot that doesn't allow the viewer a moment of boredom or rest. From the story of two hit-man on a job, to a fixed boxing match to a date between a hit-man and the wife of a mob boss. There was definitely a lot of care into the writing of the script, as everything no matter the order it is in, fits with the story. Many mysteries have been left such as what is inside of the briefcase and why Marcellus Wallace has a band-aid on the back of his neck, which may be connected. The movie redefined the action genre and reinvigorated the careers of both John Travolta and Bruce Willis. This movie is required viewing for any fan of film."
"My oh my.  ""Pulp Fiction"" is one of those roller-coasters of a movie.  It is both a joy and a trial to sit through.  Amazingly original and unforgettable, Quentin Tarantino's trash masterpiece never gets old or seem outdated.  It put a face on American independent film making in 1994. Miramax had been around since the 1970s and no one had heard of it before this film.  Studios went into a panic when this film came out because they knew it would be an amazing hit.  Of course it was.  Independent film making became the rage and hit its peak in 1996 when four of the five nominated Best Picture films were from independent studios.  The screenplay and direction by Tarantino are quite amazing, but the cast makes the film work. John Travolta (Oscar nominated) re-invented his career with this film. Bruce Willis cemented his celebrity.  Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman (both Oscar nominees) became marketable superstars.  Others who make appearances include: Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Steve Buscemi, Frank Whaley, Harvey Keitel, and of course Quentin Tarantino himself.  They all leave lasting impressions as well.  Samuel L. Jackson stood out the most to me, his lack of substantial screen time may have cost him the Oscar.  Just an amazing accomplishment, all involved deserve recognition.  Easily 5 stars out of 5."
"Pulp Fiction may be the single best film ever made, and quite appropriately it is by one of the most creative directors of all time, Quentin Tarantino. This movie is amazing from the beginning definition of pulp to the end credits and boasts one of the best casts ever assembled with the likes of Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Christopher Walken. The dialog is surprisingly humorous for this type of film, and I think that's what has made it so successful. Wrongfully denied the many Oscars it was nominated for, Pulp Fiction is by far the best film of the 90s and no Tarantino film has surpassed the quality of this movie (although Kill Bill came close). As far as I'm concerned this is the top film of all-time and definitely deserves a watch if you haven't seen it."
"Tarantino is without a doubt one of the best directors of all time and maybe the best of the 90's. His first film, Reservoir Dogs was amazing and claustrophobic, his segment in Four Rooms was by far the greatest (even though Rodriguez's was excellent too)and Jackie Brown is a wonderful homage to the Blaxploitation films of the 70's. However, Pulp Fiction remains my favourite.It was nominated for so many Oscars that I still find it hard to believe that it only got one: Best original script. I'm not complaining because Forrest Gump got best picture, since that film was also Oscar-worthy, but come on, movies like Tarantino's or the Shawshank Redemption deserved much more.Anyway, going back to the movie, I particularly liked the first and second chapters, and that's really a contradiction because one of the movie's finest characters, Mr. Wolf, appears on the third. Bruce Willis also does a great job, and as far as I'm concerned he fell in love with the movie right after having read the script. I like the way his character gives a ""tough guy"" image at the beginning and then we discover he's so affectionate and tender to his wife. Travolta is obviously the star of the movie and his second encounter with Bruce Willis in the kitchen along with the scene where he dances with Uma Thurman is when the movie reaches it's highest point.The other star is Samuel L. Jackson, who plays a wise assassin that obviously knows how to handle situations. ""And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger..."" is my favourite quote.Summarizing, Pulp Fiction is a modern classic and a must-see for anyone who is at least aware of what a movie is. I give it a 9 out of 10."
"Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is a terrific film. It also gets better with each viewing, especially if one of those happens to be on a big theatrical screen where all of the BIG compositions get bigger and more detailed. How much else is there to talk about it after all these years? It's filled with dynamite, sudden and always interesting action, great and naturally clever dialogue, and memorable characters. Also, the acting is always something to behold as by turns straightforward, over the top, subtle, and just downright menacing and spot-on. The directing is one of the strongest that we've seen from Tarantino, as he makes his choices in pacing with shots in unconventional ways but never in a way that would be distracting. And writing, already noted, has been copied by many, and only equaled by a select few. The dance sequence. Samuel L. Jackson's superlative monologuing. It has loyalty among low lifes, and many other odd characters that are all bad and not one is a villain or hero. And somehow even after years of parody and terrible rip-offs, it holds its own and- as one can say after seeing it at a midnight screening- holds its audience as much as it had the countless times before they saw it (or if they are, the first time). The first time you're surprised, the second time you look for the clues or other ambiguity, and then the third time you laugh you head off. The fourth time... I'll leave to you."
"I just finished screening this movie for the first time after putting it off for a number of years because of what seemed like equivocating appraisals from some of my friends. In hindsight, however, it seems to me that while the movie must have definitely bowled them over, overall they weren't sure exactly what to make of it or how to articulate what were probably a confused mix of feelings. But I am so impressed that I feel compelled to add a few specific observations to the many fine reviews already on this database.First, this movie hits you with an impact somewhere in between, say, APOCALYPSE NOW and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, and for some people may be just as disturbing (however, in this respect I am happy to report I didn't think it rose to the level of NATURAL BORN KILLERS). Full of graphically violent action and language, PULP FICTION is not a picture for everyone - I would definitely not recommend it to my parents, born in the 1930's (even to my one fairly ""hip"" relative of the same generation who, at age 66, still teaches high school sex education and likes to talk about things like sunbathing nude, among other potentially sensitive issues).Irrespective of audience sensibilities, however, the film-makers, supported by superb acting in every role, manage to create a world full of the most fascinating sleazy characters possibly ever to appear on screen. From Travolta's pronounced almost-child-like curiosity about the world to Jackson's sincere and thoughtful philosophical ruminating and Willis's deep devotion to the memory of his father, I think such fascination lies not only in the characters' personalities as they are portrayed but in the way they tantalize the viewer into considering the possibility that such people could actually exist. As a lawyer of some years' experience dealing with all sorts of people I was particularly drawn to this aspect of the film.Thus, and in response to some other reviewers' comments, I think this movie is more character-driven than plot-driven. Instead of a story peopled by basically weakly developed characters employed primarily as a mere device to move the plot along, as is too frequently the case in the movies (especially these days), the undeniably strong, clever, and unpredictable plot lines in PULP FICTION are actually of essentially secondary interest and importance, serving primarily as vehicles to get you worried about the fate of characters you can't help caring about despite the truly low attributes that otherwise form the basis for their respective personas. As at least one other reviewer noted, when the film ends you are actually disappointed, left craving more of these crazy people and their explosive lives.Finally, and as strange as it may sound, this film reminds me of another Monumentally Great Film which one would never typically associate with it in any way in a million years - CASABLANCA. As in that film made way back in 1942, and as another reviewer has suggested, perhaps its special appeal - its unusually high degree of emotional impact - lies in its distinctly successful simultaneous application of several different genres in a single film - drama, action, dark humor - with the whole thing bound together by essentially flawless execution in every department. And while CASABLANCA is no doubt clearly much more wholesome and high-minded, like the older film PULP FICTION is not without a pronounced theme of redemption, even if it is not as strongly felt, considering all the later film's sleaze and violence.In sum, when people say that this is probably the best film of the 1990's, it is easy to see why. Fundamentally a truly outstanding movie, it is a must-see for anyone who considers themself a film buff and can handle graphic subject matter.(Incidentally, if you would like a more toned-down, much more overtly humorous and less serious picture with a not-altogether dissimilar look and feel, don't miss another 1990's Travolta picture, GET SHORTY.)"
Pulp Fiction is one of those movies that not everyone can enjoy. Many people say that it's boring and senseless. It is true that the plot isn't something special but it isn't the plot that makes this movie so unique but the awesome script and great cinematography.Probably one of the greatest things in this movie are the dialogues. The dialogues just like in all other Tarantino movies aren't directly connected with the plot. Take the first dialogue between Samuel Jackson and John Travolta. They are talking about how a certain burger is called in France. This and many others dialogues don't have a direct relation with the plot line but their function is to somehow build the characters' personalities.The other thing that makes this movie so unique is the unexpected turn of events. Like in all other Tarantino movies you don't know who they are going to kill next or what is going to happen. The scene where Vincent shoots Marvin in the face is a great example for such unexpected turn of events. This makes the viewer more intrigued and thus makes the whole experience form the movie way better.There isn't much more that can be said about Pulp Fiction. It's not a movie that everyone will enjoy but still deserves to be seen.
"Pulp Fiction, despite borrowing from just about every movie ever made, is the most invigorating cinema experience a filmgoer can ever hope for. Its hodgepodge of violence, mayhem, and generally deviant behavior is an assault on the senses, not to mention political correctness. However, despite all the film's cleverness and style, it hinges on the performance put forth by Samuel L. Jackson as Jules. The fact that he was denied an Oscar is a downright shame. Martin Landau, the best supporting actor winner that year, was terrific and funny in Ed Wood, but Jackson was perhaps the most commanding screen presence in film history as the bible-quoting, godfearing hitman. The last scene in the coffee shop with Tim Roth still sends chills down my spine, no matter how many times I've seen it. Rumors of a prequel involving Jules and Vincent (John Travolta) have been floating around lately. If Quentin Tarantino wishes to regain the fans he lost with the dissapointing (but still pretty good) Jackie Brown, he should get to work right away. I'll be the first in line to see the finished product."
"It kind of feels redundant trying to write a review for Pulp Fiction as it approaches its 20th birthday. As a film it needs no introduction, it won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, won a BAFTA and Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay (Tarantino), and garnered a whole host of other awards and nominations. Box office beef was meaty and its reputation even now shows no sign of waning (it currently sits at number 4 on the IMDb top 100 list), it is by definition one cool MOFO of a movie, a picture loved by a cross section of demographics. But why?Pulp Fiction oozes humour, romance, violence and stylish flourishes. It remains compulsive viewing throughout; even as it threatens to get submerged in its own complex structure. Film lover Tarantino takes a number of low life and unfortunate characters from Los Angeles, mainlines then with movie clichés, and then amazingly breathes new life into them. It knowingly winks at B movies from the past yet always remains fresh on its own terms. I myself having just revisited the film after a 5 year gap can attest to just how well it holds up, laughing at the dialogue, perched on the edge of the seat as violence starts to rumble, and yes, singing along with that most catchy of soundtracks.Yet for all its flashiness and hipster chattering, there's one thing that often gets overlooked when talk of Pulp Fiction's greatness arises. That of a basic human urge to survive or find salvation, Tarantino's main characters may be bottom feeders or scummy operatives of the underworld, but there's love and needing beating slowly in its dark heart before the drugs and violence take a hold. Neat trick that from Tarantino, brilliant in fact. 10/10"
"With all the praise that the film has gotten over the years, (most of it justified) I think a little clear-eyed analysis is needed. While the film is well-written and has interesting characters, it is by no means a deep character study. In terms of the intricacies of its plot, it's not even in the same ball park as some of the great films in history. With that being said, when it comes to pure entertainment, few films can top Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. It is a film that is built on sharp dialogue, cultural references, catchy tunes and strong performances from its talented ensemble cast. A lively, stylish, colorful, violent, funny and witty motion picture."
"I was tempted to stop watching it about four times. I went up to the end just to see if, at least, there is something extraordinary or unexpected there. I really can't understand what all these viewers found to this film, to score it so high. It's the first time (or the second I'm not sure!) that I get into the mood of writing a review. The reason, I guess, is because this film is the fifth in the top 250 ranking and I couldn't see why. The curiosity of the ranking was also the reason of watching it at the first place. There is a high end casting and a top level director but nothing more, IN MY OPINION. I tried looking it through the eyes of 1994 but still compared to other productions of the age is far behind. If you find yourself in the position wondering whether to watch this film or not, due to its place in the list don't waste your time!"
"Pulp Fiction is a good, well-acted movie that is way, way, way over hyped by its fans. The core of the movie, the blathering of Vincent and Jules is fun and enjoyable. Bruce Willis as a hot-headed boxer does an excellent job communicating his fear and desperation. In the end, the movie's quirks and twists are merely to make a rather run-of-the-mill arthouse film seem more edgy. There is no question that this is a well made and fun movie. However it is not the amazing Second Coming of Christ as many Tarantinophiles would have us all believing. Many of the components are merely there to make us, the audience, gasp in horror or gaze in amazement. Do we REALLY need to watch John Travolta stick a needle in Uma Thurmond?  Yeah, sure it was cool at the time but that coolness quickly wears off when you realize there is really nothing likeable about any of these people."
"I think one of the problems many people have with this movie is that it defined and set into motion an extremely irritating trend in contemporary film. The god-awful clones of Tarantino pouring out of indie and mainstream studios alike should not, however, detract from the brilliance and subtlety of this movie. It works simply because those moments of brilliance (I have to admit I know the whole ""Jules redemption-speech"" by heart) that its imitators lack come in the midst of the camp and gore they all do so well. Tarantino alone uses an adolescent obsession with shallowness and morbidity to high satirical effect--like all great films (or even novels), this movie sets itself into a two-dimensional genre (absurd, pop-culture, comic-book situations) and then undermines its own genre by exposing the heart and soul underneath. There are too many points in the movie in which this happens to mention, but a few come to mind: the blown kiss from Vincent to Mia at the end of the first (or maybe second) story; the death of Vincent; the obvious emotional dedication of Butch to his wife at the end of his own story; Vincent's unwillingness to believe in his own supernatural salvation without realizing he's doomed; and, of course, the climactic speech. With the exception of Jules's final words, many of these moments seem at first to be horrifying or funny--but this is only because they fit so well into the flow of the script. A second glance shows them to be moments so poignant that the only reason they work is because they are so unique to the characters and their situations. The changes in each (or the lack of change) come, in a sense, as they individually choose to either drive for them or fall behind. Most die-hard fans of the movie, I'm sure, have heard the story of the briefcase and the band-aids on the back of Wallace's neck (the entire movie being a quest to bring back his stolen soul), and although Tarantino has denied it, he can't deny that the movie is full of such heroic themes: escape by trial, the reclamation of past, love as both physical salvation and personal security, a will to believe in something beyond one's own selfish world. I won't say that if you don't like this movie that you're mistaken or ignorant, but I think that Tarantino puts his audience into settings much like his characters are in: cheap, full of profanity and nastiness, fleeting. The best of them break through; I think he asks that anyone watching do the same."
"The proof of the pudding, they say, is in the eating. The proof of the movie is in the watching. Most of the top 250 IMDb movies have kept me glued to my seat--with this one I found my mind wandering to that jigsaw puzzle I hadn't finished or the possibility of some popcorn. I found I had very little interest in the characters or in what was going on.I asked myself why. Technically the film is very good. The actors all hit their marks and Samuel L. Jackson is particularly outstanding. I liked Maria de Madeiros also as Bruce Willis' wife Fabienne. The camera work is occasionally interesting, as the long scene where we watch Bruce Willis listen unemotionally to Marsellus go on. Interesting, certainly, but rather pointless.Indeed, that's the problem: so much of what goes on is pointless. It's a big long shaggy dog story, told by one of those irritating people who can't get the story straight and have to keep going back: ""Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you about that. Well, you know what I was telling you before . . ."" I tried to find some justification for the higgledy-piggledy way in which this story is told. It does result in the best scene being the last one. But if this scene was the point then why not design the script so that the action is seen to be moving toward this goal and cut out everything that happens afterward? In the end I don't think Tarentino knew what story he was telling and that's why so much is so pointless.The scenes of Butch attempting to control his temper, of his dilemma whether to help Marsellus, and the final scene in the restaurant are all good and entertaining as far as they go but they don't fall into a coherent framework. And the rest is quite dull.The dialogue is not witty or clever although it occasionally has its moments. The constant profanity is as pointless as the rest; the point of profanity is presumably to emphasize what one is saying, but if everything is emphasized, nothing is. The mind becomes numbed by it. It's like someone who shouts all the time. Eventually you stop listening. The quotes give you a pretty good idea of what the dialogue is like: when ""Shut the f*ck up, fat man!"" is listed as a memorable quote, you know how inane the conversation is.That this poorly composed script should have won an Oscar is a pretty clear indictment of the Academy."
"this movie is painfully overrated: every time someone tells me that pulp fiction is their favorite movie of all time, I die a little bit inside. Mind you, it's not a terrible movie, it has style and memorable moments, but nothing THAT great that justifies the hype among these pseudo intellectuals. You know the type: these college kids who just love Pulp Fiction and Fight Club, probably jerk off to Bukowski's poetry, think Kubrick is THE GREATEST DIRECTOR OF ALL TIME, absolutely LOVE to bash religion and make sure everyone knows they're an atheist, and yet still manage to think they're better than you. The sad thing about Pulp Fiction is that I used to enjoy it when I was younger, wasn't my favorite movie of all time, but was definitely on the top 10. Watching it now, having endured thousands of these guys and their egos, left me bitter and annoyed. I realized that I didn't even speak all that much about the movie, sorry about that, I'm just salty."
"You want to do something really neat? Take the movie ""Pulp Fiction"" and re-cut it, so that, instead of being out of sequence, it is actually in proper sequence. It can be done. Why do this? Because if you do, you will see what a nothing movie this really is. There is no central plot, there is no real theme, or story or climax. It is just a bunch of tricks and overly snappy dialog, masquerading a piece of fluff that has as much depth as the kiddie pool. Hey, more power to Tarantino, the guy is a Houdini, full of slight of hand. But are we really so simple, that we are ranking this one of the ten greatest movies ever made? Come on! OK, I know that Travolta is cool and Jackson is funny. However, let's reserve the greatest films of all-time category for real masterpieces and real stories, and not some overly slick pulp geared towards video store geeks."
"The hugely overrated trivial chatting, the grotesque violence, the moral vacuum, the deadly slowness, the length --- about an hour too long --- make it incomprehensible today how this picture ever made people rave the way they did on this board.The greatest film ever? Excuse me, this is a feature film that says nothing, depicts no authentic feelings or character development, is grossly self-indulgent and filled with idiotically implausible situations, such as people firing powerful handguns repeatedly, simultaneously and then hanging around chatting as if nobody would ever report the firing and summon the law.Perhaps the most implausible character of all is played by Mr Tarantino, who shouts at the two hoodlum killers as if they were playmates from school and complains that his wife will divorce him if she returns from work to find a car in the garage containing a man with his head blown off.Where is the moral compass of the people who revere this schoolboy nonsense? Nobody in the film is remotely principled, and nor is anyone (except possibly the pawnbroker) actually evil. The scene where he releases a leather-studded sadist from a cage is possibly the most unbelievable rubbish ever deployed in a Hollywood feature.""It's only entertainment,"" I hear people protest. Well the difference between Mr Tarantino and film-makers of stature is that they are capable of entertaining while instructing, and of integrating the two."
"Wow, a lot of people have been fooled into believing that this was a great film. I've never seen anything like it, and I hope I never will again. This is one slop of a film, and I'm disgusted to know that it has so many high reviews. It was a confusing ball of goo that amounted to nothing. I didn't care for the characters and never will. What a hopeless bunch of freaks. I don't jump on the ""freak bandwagon"" unless they're natural ones, not arrogant embodiments of deranged entertainment. The glorification of smut is worse than the smut, and that is exactly what this movie is. The sad thing is, I don't believe that some of these actors were acting at all. They were just being themselves. Travolta and Jackson in wigs??? That was scary! The only interesting thing about the movie was the sequence of events. I like the way that it started at one point and ended in the same, but dislike everything in between. The problem with this film is that it tricks the audience into giving it great reviews. It uses the ""peer pressure"" method. You know, ""this movie is for intelligent and cool people"" CRAP!! Well, I'll gladly stand among those who know that this was nothing more than a ""shock flick"". It was produced to see if the letter could be pushed a little further. Unfortunately, it drags what little respect that Hollywood has with it. I'm afraid that this is one of the major stepping stones to a pathetic industry that only produces films for vulgar lust.There's my two pennies, don't spend them all in one place!"
"There are many differing schools of thought regarding Quentin Tarantino and his so-called ""style"". There are those who believe that the director who began his career as a humble video store clerk with a voracious appetite for movies of every conceivable style is talented and worth imitating. While Tarantino has made some movies worth discussing for their positive qualities (Reservoir Dogs is, by far, his best effort), this group of movies is rather small, especially considering that he has only directed five movies. There is another school of thought who regards his works as inane, self-indulgent, and bloated. Pulp Fiction, written and directed by Tarantino, and released in 1994, is his most divisive movie simply by virtue of being his most well-known. Upon its release, it was hailed as a warning shot to a complacent Hollywood- the maverick behind the indie hit Reservoir Dogs apparently had something else up his sleeve.Pulp Fiction is ostensibly a crime story featuring the interconnecting lives of several characters. However, upon repeat viewings, the viewer begins to wonder exactly what that something is. Personally, I found this movie ran too long in spots, likely because Tarantino is so ridiculously in love with the sound of his own voice as spoken by different actors that he is afraid to cut one speech or even a single line. Dialogue, though it doesn't necessarily need to serve the story to justify its inclusion, should not be so dense as to drive the viewer out of the experience. When John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson, on the way to retrieving a briefcase for their employer, are talking about European hamburgers and foot massages, the scene plays like a witty outtake- as though the actors so understood the style of the movie that they were in that they felt comfortable riffing with the material. Not so- the rest of the movie is filled with conversations of a similar type, including (but not limited to) body piercing, blueberry pancakes, hamburgers (again), and coffee (this one performed by Quentin Tarantino himself, as though he couldn't wait to get a shot at delivering his own lines).The strangest thing is, while the characters are ""in character"", as Samuel L. Jackson says in an opening scene, the movie is quite enjoyable. When the characters are placed into real confrontations, the movie takes on an entirely different persona and becomes at least a decent crime movie. Ultimately, however, these scenes are few and far between and, unfortunately, the movie clocks in at 154 minutes. There's really only a decent short film in all of this.The movie also lacks what I would call a plot. The movie is described as three stories about one story, though that one story (ending, chronologically, with Bruce Willis and his irritating Euro girlfriend riding off into the sunset) doesn't connect the characters enough to be truly about one thing.Ultimately the movie is a prime example of what happens when a VCR and a wide selection of movies replace film school. The movie lacks a coherent center and seems more like something that was made for the sake of just committing something to film and resurrecting the flagging career of John Travolta. The movie is too large in scope to sustain itself, and, in the end, implodes because there is really no conviction behind the presentation- too concerned with being a hipster-cool riff on a crime story, rife with pop in-jokes and 70's music (perhaps the best part of the movie is the soundtrack), somebody must have neglected to mention that the movie went nowhere and lacked the momentum to even get there.While all of these qualities combine to form a truly deplorable viewing experience, I do have to mention Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson as two performers in this movie who, I felt, got away clean. Bruce Willis probably gets away with it because he's alone for the majority of his segment and, therefore, doesn't have anybody with whom to trade despicably derisible dialogue. Samuel L. Jackson gets a mention because of the scene at the very end of the movie in which he confronts Tim Roth's character and makes him realize that there are far more fearsome powers at work in the world than robbing a diner. In fact, the scenes coming directly at the beginning and the end of the movie are the two best, and everything else is filler.As you no doubt have guessed, I fall squarely in the latter of the two groups I mentioned at the beginning of this review. Pulp Fiction is inane, self-indulgent, and bloated."
"The hit-men Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) work for the powerful mobster Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). Vincent has lived in Amsterdam for three years and is assigned with Jules to retrieve a suitcase that belongs to their boss. There is a shootout and Vincent and Jules do not die because the shots of one gangster fails the target. Jules believes that God's hand has interfered in the bullets and he decides to redeem himself from his life of gangster. Vincent is assigned by Marsellus to go out with his wife Mia (Uma Thurman)while he is traveling and he is scared when she has an OD. Marsellus pays the boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) to lose his fight on the fifth round, but Butch wins the fight. He flees from Marsellus and his gangsters but his girlfriend Fabienne (Maria de Medeiros) forgets to bring his golden watch that belongs to his family for many generations. Butch returns to his apartment and he faces Vincent first and Marsellus later. But an incident with sadistic perverts brings Marsellus and Butch side by side. ""Pulp Fiction"" is one of my favorite movies ever. I had seen this movie for the last time on 11 January 2002 and today I have just watched it again. When we compare the nominations for Best Picture in the 1995 Oscar (""Pulp Fiction"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and the winner and weakest ""Forrest Gump"") with the movies nominated this year we can see that the Oscar winners are not necessarily the best movies of the cinema history. ""Pump Fiction"" saved the career of John Travolta that was in the ostracism and put on the spot Quentin Tarantino after the cult ""Reservoir Dogs"". The complex screenplay with four entwined story has shown to the world the brilliance of Quentin Tarantino. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Pulp Fiction – Tempo de Violência"" (""Pulp Fiction: Time of Violence"")"
"A masterpiece? Do me a favour! Perhaps it's because of the hype that surrounds this film, but I was really disappointed with what I saw.Two and a half hours was too long in my view, and nothing particularly out of the ordinary happens.I didn't find it clever, nor were the ""unforgettable"" scenes like the dance between Travolta and Thurman or Samuel L Jackson's speech unforgettable.Maybe because cinema has advanced so much since 1994 that I would have had to watch it then to appreciate it, but I only recently saw Hitchcock's Rear Window for the first time and enjoyed that immensely.People go on as if this film has the best storyline and gangster scenes ever but quite frankly, it doesn't.Moreover, I found Natural Born Killers more affective for it's style than Pulp Fiction.It does have some good scenes, and I was rooting for Bruce Willis' character throughout, but I saw nothing that makes this film outstanding or worthy of being so high in IMDb's rankings."
"Overrated is an understatement. This movie is start to finish garbage. I though Reservoir Dogs was an OK movie, and I liked Inglourious Basterds a lot. I don't have a problem with violent or perverse content in movies (My all-time favorite is David Fincher's Fight Club), but this movie is just crap. I understand the nostalgic aura about how this movie ""revolutionized"" what was acceptable to do in movies, but that doesn't make it a good movie by any means.The acting as a whole was entirely sub-par. As usual, Samuel L. Jackson's acting is consistent with the career he has built on shouting (a la ""Snakes on a Plane"") and contributed nothing positive to the movie. Same goes for John Travolta, whose acting was arguably worse than Jackson's. There's a significant unconvincing ""memorization"" tone to his lines. The only reason this is considered to have resurrected his career is because he was in the movie at all; once the movie became a cult classic, he became the marketable actor he once was.I already said I don't have a problem with movies that contain explicit language, but in Pulp Fiction, there are certain instances where too many expletives are inserted, and I'm not sure for what effect. If you listen to Tarentino's lines (as Jimmy) and Jackson's lines (when they're cleaning out the car), I think these lines best exemplify the overkill I'm talking about.Another thing about the movie is it is generally not relatable. I realize this seems like not a legitimate complaint- after all, how marketable would a movie really be if it was wholly relatable? However, I just felt like the over-glorification heroin use, among other aspects really turned me off. Also, usually movies that glorify or portray behavior/lifestyles similar to those depicted in Pulp Fiction have characters that are normal human beings. In this movie, every character is either a murderer, a gangster, a drug dealer, someone with a drug problem, an accomplice to a crime, or a rapist. I just don't see the redeeming social value here.If you like movies with quality acting, character development, any sort of plot, or a message that doesn't bash the Bible; chances are Pulp Fiction is not for you. The one thing that Tarentino got right was the title: Pulp Fiction; this movie is both ""cheaply produced art"" and ""fake."""
"Sorry for the image, but if you take a bowl of crap, rearrange it, put some sugar and a little cherry on top, what to you get? ... a bowl of crap.This is the most overrated film of all time. I'm even feeling strange to call it a film. It has no story, no feelings, no plot, no music - just 4 different scenes of disgusting, violent, abusive, offending and racist content put together in a mixed sequence.How this crap scores a 9 on IMDb is beyond me. Sometimes when people see a 9 they automatically deceive themselves into believing this is a masterpiece and that maybe if they didn't like it, something is wrong with their opinion or taste. Nothing's wrong. It's a bad movie from beginning to end. The problem is that sometimes Hollywood movies are over-hyped for business reasons like what happened in Titanic and Avatar which by the way were ""OK"" movies but didn't deserve the huge credit they received.I gave this a 1 because Samuel L. Jackson was the only thing interesting in this disaster. I'm not going to tell those of you that haven't seen it not to, you have to go through the experience on your own and make your fare judgment. Don't listen to anyone's opinion - especially the ones that think if you love this one, then you're COOL!"
"I really find it difficult to believe this movie is rated highly by people. It's hands down the worst movie I've seen in my life (58 years). When my wife and I went to see it, soon after it came out, multiple people walked out of the theater saying either it was a terrible movie and/or it sickened them. Maybe all of us were just allergic to Tarantino's sick fascination with violence. The violence is just so gratuitous and casual as to make it seem like a bad video game. Outside of that, the overall movie has the feel of being viewed through the eyes of someone high on bad drugs. Please excuse my lack of specifics regarding the film, but I've fortunately blocked most of them from my memory. In any event, I worry about a society that thinks this is a good film, I really do."
"Is it possible that something so loathsome and awful could actually be adored and lauded by millions of people?  Is it only a matter of chance that some movies are loved and others hated, regardless of their content?  I hope this is true, because I cannot believe that there is actually anything good about the movie Pulp Fiction to lead any sane, reasoned, drug-free person to write the glowing comments that surround mine, much less the oodles of people who actually handed over their money to see this thing.Why is this movie so bad, you ask?  Okay, I'll tell you, even though it's like pointing out why windows are transparent.  Starting with the script, I see no reason to be impressed by an assemblage of overly stylistic dialogue and flat, boring characters.  There is nothing amazing about two guys talking about French McDonald's restaurants, and then killing some guys. Every awful stretch of dialogue is dragged out as long as it will last, and then some.  It's as if Tarantino said to himself ""I think I can cram one more line about milkshakes in here"".  You have to give him credit for padding the film in ways that nobody's ever tried before.  The actors look as though they're doing their best to salvage this turkey (and they are talented), all the while knowing in the back of their minds how much of a cow pie the whole thing is.  As far as Tarantino's directorial style is concerned, he should just get himself a career in Nike commercials because that's where his talent level cuts off."
"I will never understand why Pulp Fiction is hailed by so many as one of the greatest films ever made. Quentin Tarintino's first film Reservoir Dogs was amazing. It had excellent performances, some good action scenes, an impressive structure and fantastic sound track. When Pulp Fiction came out in my country in October 1994, i could not wait to see it. Empire Magazine gave it 5 stars. I remember when i went up to Glasgow to see it with an anticipation i had not felt since i had went to see some thing like Star Wars or Indiana Jones.Oh boy, twenty minutes in and i was already sick to death of Samuel Jackson's character. He just talked and talked and talked and....talked. John Travolta's Vince Vega was a guy i wanted to decimate, oh Travolta you looked ridiculous with those hair extensions and then you talked and talked and talked with Uma Thurman in a silly black wig. There was so much talking in this film that it made me want to walk out. I have only ever done this once in my life and it was with that utter garbage Jack Nicholson flick Wolf. Tosh.So i kept hoping that something good would happen...Christopher Walken as an army bloke talking and talking about a gold watch up his ass...NOT GOOD...a male rape scene with talk...NOT GOOD...Quentin Tarintino turning up in a cameo that should have got him shot (in real life) talk talk about disposing of bodies...oh, this film was the pits, i must have been the only one in the audience that hated this film, because everyone was whooping and hollering like they were watching a Naked Gun comedy. Oh yes, they loved it.Quiet frankly my admiration of Tarintino was gone forever, he got his head together with the brilliant Jackie Brown then lost the plot again with the silly Kill Bill volumes. Pulp Fiction is one of the worst movies I've ever had to endure, its a long boring ride to a sore head."
"I must be one of the few individuals on this planet that totally detested this film. I left the cinema feeling extremely ill. I went along to this film on the recommendation that it was highly amusing but I guess their idea of ""humour"" isn't quite the same as mine.Sure, it had some clever moments but why belabour the point."
"Pulp Fiction is a mess of a movie. Gratuitously violent and indulgent. Everyone wants to talk about the humour of going over a bump and someone being shot. How hilarious is that (this comment is meant to be ironic. I note this for the Hollywood saturated brain-dead).To call it a classic requires calls for major surgery on the definition. The film is really just a sign of a sick culture. Stay away from it. The irony wasn't lost on me. The problem is that it was of the sledge-hammer variety.There are so many good films that I am at a loss to see why this is chosen for special consideration. And to make matters worse, the editor on this programme insists I use American spelling. Goodness, get a life. Program with ""me"" on the end of it was still English last time I looked."
"To contradict my summary line, this film is actually one of the least appealing films I have ever seen. It's violent, disgusting and crude, and none of these are particularly bad traits, its just that it offers me nothing, and leaves me with an emptiness, the fact that I have wasted 2 1/2 hrs watching this, then not to be compensated.This is entirely my opinion, and clearly mine alone. Nearly everyone loves this film, and they are honest enough to clarify it, but if my review is completely the opposite, I still feel compelled to write.I'm sorry, but 9th on the list of the top 250 films, seems grossly inappropriate."
"I can't see what people see in this movie. I did not like it because it is violent for violence's sake and unless you think that is funny, it is not interesting. Another movie from Quentin Tarantino that is just crude. Pulp says it all. The writing is clever. I won't deny that. The cast is good. What a waste of talent. To put a movie like this on a pedestal is a sad commentary on our times. It is hard to identify most of the characters unless you are a criminal type. It seams in order to make a ""GREAT"" movie all you have to do is put as much violence, sex and the F word as you can and people will laud you. There is no redeeming value in this movie."
"Well, I finally saw 'Pulp Fiction'. Hadn't after all this time, but I've heard *so* much ta-doo over it, so I rented it.UGH.I guess I must not be film critic material, because I didn't appreciate the 'art' of this film, or its 'brilliance', or any 'statement' it might have made. It was unpleasant, filled with scumbag people I cared nothing about, doing godawful things to each other with horrendously graphic visuals and appalling dialogue. It jumped around in time, circling back to where it opened, but from another viewpoint, and while that may be some sort of artsy crafting in editing or storytelling, it doesn't save it from the fact that it was just plain revolting.When the characters could get away for a second from m-f-ing all over the place, there *was* some interesting verbal exchange... bright and witty and even vaguely profound, but Kafka it ain't. I have to say, I thought all the performances were incredible, esp Samuel Jackson, but can't Quentin Tarantino stay OUT of any of his own films?! Even playing a 'nicer' guy, he comes off as a borderline psycho. I thought it was *very* interesting, tho, to see Chicago Hope's Eric Stoltz in there as a drug dealer.I worry about people's minds, if this is what they think of as a great movie. EEK! A movie about redemption? Gee... I didn't see any of that. If perhaps a character got out of the violent melee alive, I'd hardly call that 'redemption', if they are hardly anyone worth caring about being redeemed in the first place. An earthquake fault could have opened up and swallowed the lot of 'em, and I would have applauded. People think it's really cool or trendy to give accolades to trash nowadays.Time to get some mouthwash for my eyes, and get the stench out of 'em."
"This is a great film? By what standards? Anyone can string together a bunch of violent, disjointed scenes, designed to shock and disturb the viewer. Violence, in and of itself, without context and pertinence to the story, is the tool of no-talent scoundrels masquerading as filmmakers. Such, unfortunately, is Tarantino. What a shame for Travolta that this was his 'comeback' film. For me, the only watchable part of this film was the sequence featuring Bruce Willis. Even that, though...how Willis was convinced to be in this film is a mystery to me. Cameos by Emil Sitka, Christopher Walken's brief part, and Harvey Keitel's appearance cannot save this self-indulgent and troubling example of a director gone wild, suffused with the sense of his own talent. This was a BOMB."
"Pulp Fiction is often considered the coolest and greatest film of all time. But, the people who usually say this are pretentious film snobs and people who think this is something extraordinary. Excuse me, it isn't.First of all the film has NO plot. If a film has no plot, then why should we care about the unlikeable characters? Second, the diagloue is so....BAD. Does the director think people actually talk like this, because, well they don't.Third, the grossly, glamorous violence, is disgusting. This isn't a horror film, so why do we need such violence popping in and out of the movie? So, I urge everyone to avoid the hype of this pretentious, terrible mess."
"Pulp Fiction in my opinion is the most overrated movie of all-time.  I really don't understand why many people claim it to be one of the greatest movies ever.  It's cruel, stupid, idiotic.  It's full of violence & f-words to the point that it's sickening.  It's like, let's get a couple of guns, a couple of f-words, a couple of murders and let's combine them to make a movie.  I hated everything about it.  EVERYTHING.  To me, all the positive comments on this site about this movie are written by only 1 fan under different usernames.  So the scenes were not in chronological order, big deal.  That doesn't make it a masterpiece.  This is hollywood garbage. There are some scenes that are sick.  The movie is SICK.  This is my review. I gave it a 2/10 just because the actors are respected.  Everything else is idiotic."
"Simply put Pulp Fiction is the silliest film I have every seen, it puts  Battlefield Earth and The Long Kiss Goodnight (spookily starring the  two leads from this film) firmly in the shadows, they look like rare  vintage wines next to this cheap plonk. The fact it is so highly  revered by so many, and even considered profound, makes me fear for the  very existence of modern society.  There are some fundamental reasons I dislike this film with a passion,  the first being the pacing and substance, the film really mirrors it's  director to perfection, yapping and a mumblin and a stumblin from start  to finish, enthusiastically about....Nothing! If Qentin was not such an  untalented, cretinous buffoon I would call him the new David Lynch. The  only substance in PF is of the white powdery verity, the film is just a  collection of sick images splashed on screen willy nilly strung loosely  together by some sharp but pointless dialogue. The film was too crude,  made purely for shock value. When violence, male rape, drug abuse,  accidental shootings and other such fun filled things are packaged as  cool and even as comedy in the hands of an immature director you get a  highly irresponsible film, and to sell it as some sort of 'smart art'  piece is doubly irresponsible.  Then there is the complete lack of character development and depth.  There are no characters, only 2 dimensional machines created solely to  perform acts of severe violence and drop in a few wise cracks, they  perform actions in one scene that seem to have no effect or relation to  what happens in their next scene. Not one of them is even slightly  likable or in possession of any redeemable characteristics apart from  perhaps Butch (Willis), did I mention he is a violent thug, murderer  and a thief? Then there is Mia who seems to have little purpose in the  film other than an excuse to include the very uncomfortable scene where  an over weight Travolta boogies on the dance floor. Yes she is in the  'famous' needle scene as well, but what else? The section featuring  Vince and Mia was just dropped and barely mentioned again like Mia  herself, so what was the point? A question I asked of the film  throughout. I quickly realised that nobody in the film was there to be  developed, any one of them could have been dropped (apart from Butch)  or their actions performed by a completely new character without making  a spot of difference to the film, their actions were not to be the  subject of scrutiny. That would be asking too much of the Tarantino who  is clearly only interested in attempting to make stuff look cool. He is  the most unoriginal man on the planet only capable of tacky 'homage'  (ie, he is a thief) action films. Don't believe me? Watch Kill Bill  where he even pays homage to his own film, this one! I do give credit  to him in one respect. He realised that if he re-jigged the order of  plot events he could not only look artistically swish but he could  disguise the fact that the story is not worth the toilet paper it was  written on, impressing upon many the fallacy that the hack job  narrative structure enhanced the story.  The direction is experimental but quite frankly tacky and laughable at  times. One scene featuring a near comatose Butch in particular comes to  mind, the camera is stuck dead still on him while Marsellus (Rhames)  uses the m-f word 100 times in about 5 minutes, totally amateurish. The  only memorable performance is from Jackson, who could make the  ingredients list of a packet of cookies sound fun, he is offset by a  flat performance from Travolta. That brings me to the 'witty' dialogue  which, apart from the violence, is the crux of the piece. It is  unfortunate then, that this dialogue basically consists of idiots  talking a load of nonsense about such deep things as cheeseburgers,  milkshake, foot massages, cleaning up skull and brain chunks and some  coffee that is described as gourmet s**t. Some dialogue was witty but  mostly it was just utterly pointless, the characters deliver it with  such perceived style and coolness despite the fact they were talking  about, frankly, a lot of BS. Add this to the fact there is (barring  brief moments in Butch's story) no plot, no emotion and especially no  substance and you have one worthless film. ""Ah you don't get it"" they  all scream, don't make me laugh, the circular narrative and the  ham-fisted attempt at redemption at the end does not equal substance.  The ending was hilariously cheap, obviously a desperate attempt to  justify a pointless 2 hour string of images in one strike. Is it meant  to be profound? Well after sitting through the whole film which  consisted of characters that were never developed adequately, where no  actions or events were properly tackled, challenged or explored with  any great thought or depth during which I was never required to care  even once, I was presented with one of the most cheesy, pointless  monologues in film history. Oh and a parody of QT's fans - the  briefcase is opened and they stare at the shiny thing and go ""ooooh, it  beautiful"". It is all a hollow gesture when you consider the character  that delivers the speech and his actions directly following it,  combined with the entire sequence of stupid events that precede it.  Many movies these days suffer similar problems at their conclusion  because of obvious limitations in plot structure and development, some  have endings that invalidate the rest of the film, others have endings  that are invalidated by the rest of the film, with Pulp Fiction QT has  somehow achieved both simultaneously. You'll figure out what I mean. As  a rule I don't usually let a film's director put me off the film itself  but, after Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction, Tarantino films are now the  exception."
"This is what I call a fad movie.  People say it is a great movie because other people said it is great.  People are afraid to express their true feelings because they don't want to be ridiculed by their friends, especially if one is a member of the so-called X-generation.  I would imagine that the number of people who rented the video or saw it on cable that stopped watching the movie because it was so bad is fairly high, especially for a movie that is considered a great movie.However, I concede that a number of people truly like it.  However, I find that there are just as many people who are repulsed by this movie.  They just don't express their feelings in this type of format because a bad movie isn't worth the effort of making a negative opinion."
"Boring. Rubbish Film as per most of Tarantino's stuff. The only good film Tarantino ever directed was the first half of 'Dusk till Dawn'. 'True Romance' was good as well,though he didn't direct it. It was also let down somewhat by Tarantino's poor dialogue (see Patricia Arquette's speech where she reveals she's a call girl. Appalling dialogue. Very Tarantino.) I recommend you spend you time better by watching all the films he's paid homage to (ripped off) such as 'Vanishing Point', 'Death rides a horse', 'the Baby Cart series', The original 'Inglorious Bastards' etc Tarantino and his rehashing of films which have passed out of the collective conscious is pretty unpleasant and not clever. The whole point of taking influence from other people's work is to then create something of your own which is greater than the sum of its part. This Tarantino fails to do repeatedly."
"Pulp Fiction is one of those movies you feel uncomfortable to talk about in negative terms since mainstream loves it. The real killer of this movie are the dialogs supposedly so cool but instead being silly and irritating, from the very first scene when endless minutes are waisted talking about a frivolous argument. The violence in this film, rather strong, is very often disturbing but never fun or entertaining. Tarantino takes himself a little too seriously making the movie lose most of its ironical aspect. Unless you are a fan that goes wild for the overweight Travolta, you will find his so-called cult scenes dull and of no interest. All the characters in this movie are exaggerated, and that wouldn't be a bad thing, but they also are not fun. There are some good action scenes, very few, which anyhow will not save from failure a movie that lasts 2hrs 40min!"
"Sometimes after seeing a lot of good movies people want to watch something undefined and different,but it does not necessarily mean that the movie is good.When the theme song is the best part of the movie you surely can understand the quality.Sometimes ranking and charts do not show the real picture,this movie does not have a good story,a good screenplay or good dialogues but still it is in the top 10.But believe me this movie can neither give you entertainment nor any sense of understanding.Yeah i agree the movie is not boring,but it is not enjoyable either.Movies like shawshank redemption,godfather or lord of the rings,all of them has a magic-feature.Sometimes it is screenplay(Shawshank redemption) sometimes its dialogue(Godfather) sometimes it is the story (The lord of the rings) .But all of them had the important feature called continuity.I think it is a very important quality of a movie to keep it's continuity.This movie is divided into four parts which actually made the movie look like a comedy-puppet dance just with humans(Because the parts do not define one-another). The most embarrassing thing about this movie is after watching it you will think who is the fool yourself or the writer and directer.Yes this movie is different but not always Difference make something great at least in motion pictures at least.Whatever this is a must see movie for all because you can differentiate the better movies after watching it."
"Seriously. I mean, this film is mildly amusing, and I saw it at the theater when it first came out. But I really can't watch the whole thing repeatedly, like with some true classics. It certainly doesn't deserve to be ranked in the top 5, or even really the top 100.Both Reservoir Dogs and True Romance are better films, even just examining the Tarantino Ouvre. The Christopher Walken / Dennis Hopper scene (and the Pimp-fight scene) from True Romance alone blows this film away.In all, I think this is ultimately a case of the emperor not wearing any clothes. If you watch these three films in one weekend, you should clearly see that PF is the weak link of the bunch. Its success appears largely a product of buildup from the earlier films, along with the desire of people to appear hip and cool, both then and now."
"That was to lower it's stupid ridiculously high average, but to put it quite simply, I hated this movie. I didn't expect to like it, I was only watching it for Frank Whaley, but I hated this movie, really hated with it with it's various plot holes that do not make sense(watch ""Short Cuts"" if you want to see a decent movies about the interrelating lives of people), obnoxious, unsympathetic characters(I wanted to cheer when John Travolta died, or did he die? I had no idea since the film epitomized non-sense making. Someone died, and I didn't like any of the characters, with the exception of Whaley's, so I would still have wanted to cheer), bad writing, with obvious attempts at being ""cool"" and trying to have ""catch phrases,"" etc etc etc! I found nothing good about this film in the least. So why did critics? I hate when violent, immoral films are regarded as ""daring"" ""good"" film making. This one sure wasn't, and nominating John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson for acting awards?! The first one is just absurd and the second has proven to me that he can act, but the only thing he was acting in this film was obnoxious. This one is up there with ""Born on the Fourth of July"" and ""Do the Right Thing"" for my least favorite ""good"" movie."
"I have to agree with those reviewers that find this film disjointed, overly and unnecessarily violent, and just plain difficult to understand. I, for one, fail to see how this movie resurrected the career of John Travolta as his performance was just totally unbelievable. Focusing on what appears to be several unrelated life experiences, Tarrantino once again utilizes his penchant for violence, drug addiction, rape, and other assorted seedy topics. The plot (if you want to call it that) is non-existent and the scene involving Ving Rhaimes is just flat-out disgusting. For Tarrantino fans, this may be the ultimate. But for me, it's just not a good film."
"I love the movies; have seen many many movies during my half century on this planet. However, there is only one movie that I ever paid good money for and felt compelled to walk out. That film is PULP FICTION. I hadn't seen John Travolta in a film for several years and was looking forward to seeing him again. THe advertising poster looked nice but when the movie started, i was immediately turned off. I waited for it to get better; waited for the storyline to begin to take shape. However, during the first 45 minutes, i witnessed film footage that was difficult (to put it mildly) to watch. At minute 46, I gave up and decided I could no longer watch this trash and walked out. The film stinks. It was awful, it was terrible, it was disgusting."
"This is for all the guys who voted to make this movie a masterpiece. I don't know on what everyone depended in evaluating this movie. Everyone agrees that the cast includes some of the best actors out there, but a good cast doesn't mean that the movie is a masterpiece. This movie was without a subject, no message, too much repeated sentences, nothing connected with each other. You will get tired of listening to duologue's about ""foot massage"", ""hamburgers"", ""Butch's fathers watch"" .etc, these things cover more than a half of the movies length without meaning anything to the movie.I was very disappointed when I saw this movie. This movie is way overrated and should be among ""IMBD 100 Bottom"". If you want to waste two and a half hours listening only to duologue's without a subject then this is the movie and if you really want to know how a masterpiece looks like then you should watch The Shawshank Redemption."
"As a 13 year old just getting into cinema, this was the best film ever. How could I not be blown away by all the clever dialog, great characters, fantastic storyline, and gripping violence. It was just pure heaven. I saw this movie three times in the course of one year, and I still have such fond memories of watching it. It was around the time I got serious about cinema (about two years later) that I felt I needed to give this another go. I'd discovered the works of Bergman, Tarkovsky, Godard,etc, and felt a connection with film in ways I hadn't before, and I wanted to see if the movies I loved before still held up. I had every intention of loving ""Pulp Fiction"" just as much as I did back then, but I didn't. There was nothing there, no core. All the things I'd loved about it were gone. That clever dialog? Referential nonsense that gave no insight into who I was watching or attempted to expand the narrative. The great characters? Indistinctive cardboard cutouts that act as mouthpieces for Tarintino. Fantastic storyline? A pseudo throwback to film noir that can't decide whether it wants to take itself seriously or be intentionally stupid for the sake of irony. Gripping violence? It's violence that's harsh enough to put the average viewer in awe, safe enough as to not offend.It's a dead film with no ideas. A common argument I hear in it's favor is that it's somehow objectively entertaining. Why? Because it has guys with guns and monologues about McDonalds? Sorry, but that's not entertainment in my mind. Entertainment is being engaged, having to think. A film like ""Andrei Rublev"" is entertaining because, while I watch it, it evokes thought and feeling, it has something I can sink my teeth into. I can still think about it, interpret it in different ways. ""Pulp Fiction"" is just shutting your brain off for two and half hours while a man with a God complex strokes his ego.Basically, I can understand to some extent why it is so popular. It's very good at pleasing the masses, something Tarkovsky could never do. It's so perfectly designed to hook the average viewer in. But it's paper thin. This is exactly what I don't want in cinema"
"I saw this in the theater with my girlfriend because she had seen it with some friends and said it was so good. I made it through the whole thing SOMEHOW, and as we were walking through the parking lot I just started thinking that this movie has sucked over 2 hours of life from me and I'll never get it back. I honestly felt dumber for watching the whole thing. There is nothing good about this movie except a couple of members of the cast (NOT Travolta nor Thurman) and their ability was limited due to the awful script. There is nothing groundbreaking about this movie, the dialog is boring, the characters have no depth. It seems like it was made on a 24 hour deadline and they had plenty of spare time to go back and add an ""F"" word anywhere there was a space. I wouldn't have cared less if Tarantino had had another character that built an atomic bomb that accidentally detonated and wiped out everyone in this collection of trash. This is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen, especially for something so highly praised."
I thought the reels were in the wrong order.How anyone would think this weird disaster had any redeeming qualities at all is beyond me.Where's the story line?  Is there any continuity to the plot?  What's the point?
"I did - what many listed here - have done.  And rented it against my better judgement : since the previews had done little to entice me.As objective as an analysis goes : (here's my 0.02$)Positives : 1) The movie is original 2) the way the multiple stories intersect is probably the high-point 3) It contains seasoned actors that perform the role as well as can be expected. 4) I did smile during the door shooting scene with Travolta & Jackson, and few others humours one-liners/conversations.Negatives : I) There is *way* too much foul language ... is it possible to let the clock tick with hearing an f-word, I can even commend times it should be used to underline/emphasize ...etc ... but every 45 seconds !!!II) Individually, some stories might have become interesting - but by just skimming on the better ones (Bruce Willis) - and digging deeper in the blander ones (Travolta's)and the dude ""bagged"" in the car =  you come away with a : Yeah - so what ?  lingering in your mind.III) A few original lines and skewed timeline doesn't a movie make.  One has the sense of a hyped up boxing match where the Champ get cut in the 1st minute of the 1st round, thus ruled a ""no-contest"" ...I can see it appealing to some MTV-type crowd or some that desperately cr ave something original (which it is) , but gives me nothing to ""digest"" once over, VS something one can really connect (and sink his teeth into like : The Shawshank Redemption, Gattaca, American Beauty - that one is a rose, by any other name ...And it **Certainly** doesn't deserve to be in the Top100 of all times !
Enjoy the show, Folks !Jerome M."
"i watched the film 20 years later since it's making and attain 0% satisfaction of viewing pleasure considering it's 5h top position on IMDb. The movie is an experimental art house crap that chooses no destination and lack brilliant, appealing sketching of it's theme. The dialogues are the heartbeat of the film that lose it's rhythm every moment when stretching same words to make viewers understood the characters's stand, view in perplexing crime world and how they perceive.The one thing, the film depressingly is in desire of clapping is Bruce Willis part of a boxer, who is feared but not a coward. The rare male protagonist with conscience.Uma Thurman leaves a desire to see her complicated struggle with drug, lust and hunger to live free.Tarantino has tried to harvest a violent creativity, but the offspring emits extragalactic passion that fail to make any beauty.I have watched it and guarantee You waste of time"
I just managed to stay awake through this load of crappy excuse for a motion picture! It only contains a enormous amount of words that don´t say anything. The two main characters are so stupid that they should never have been created. And when Bruce Willis disappears from the movie it is so totally dead. This is a total waste of time. And so is commenting on this junk so I will stop now.
"""Pulp Fiction"" has two things going for it; Sam Jackson(robbed at the Oscars) and Christopher Walken(who has the film's funniest sequence. But that's all. The Tim Roth/Amanda Plummer scenes are irritating and too profane(swearing's great, but not like this). The Bruce Willis ""Gimp"" scene is memorable but a little sicko, and The Uma Thurman sequence(you know the one) is absolutely unbearable. She and Travolta(too fat to dance and never a terrific actor) almost ruin this 1994 Tarantino film single handedly. But no, it is Tarantino himself that ruins the film; everyone is nasty, it's excessive, the way the three stories are told is confusing, and...that's about it. Some of it is funny, and Ving Rhames is good as Marsellus Wallace, but this is too much for me. I know many like Tarantino, but I think he's a show-off in the grand tradition of John Woo(one of his heroes apparently)."
"It seems to me that much of the stylistic elements of the movie were taken from the 1955 film Kiss Me Deadly.  Kiss Me Deadly was full of quirky characters and had a mysterious chest which contained a glowing object.  The main difference in style was that the humor in Kiss Me Deadly is much more subtle, while Pulp Fiction is trying real hard to get a laugh or a reaction. Because of that, I feel that Kiss Me Deadly is the far superior of the two."
"Don't get me wrong i generally like gory mature movies. But, this movie was terrible; repulsive fast paste griddy storyline with no plot is not my idea of a good movie. It was simply a bunch of unpleasant scenes put together sporadically in a timeline sequence until the end of the movie came. And you come to realize the moral, doing bad things isn't good for you, also the most elementary concept one knows. The only one that makes it out unscathed is Samuel L. Jacksons part. And i believe this is wholly because he abandoned the path of immorality. Teaching us what is commonly known through a disgusting and unorganized movie.Nothing at all embracive, enthusing, funny, witty, or intelligible. I mean their were themes, but they were incredibly dull and boarish. I am blind to how people see this as a good movie. I found this movie as a waste of life."
I never liked this film. Horribly overrated.see the review by adam G for a better worded and longer winded explanation of my feelings on this movie.
"this is everything i don't want to see in a movie. when i watch a movie i would at least hope for it to be more excited than my own little existence at my little house in the dead of winter. id rather watch paint dry. And its as if they did it all on one take. the acting is the only halfway descent thing about it, and thats because of the obvious triple A lineup.this movie is very boring. flat out. i have seen more action and better writing in a Spanish daytime drama. there seems to be about 8-9 short films one after the other, with only slight relevance to one another. while me and my wife hated this movie, we love all of the inside jokes we play about with each other now, like how when we go out for icecream and we get a cherry, my wife dramatically sucks and licks the cherry for 5 minuets making fun of the jackrabit slims scene. i actually highly recommend watching this movie so you can see how horrible it is for yourself."
"While I am in no way against gore in a movie, I found the fact that this movie exploited it so badly, that the plot was so stupid, and the acting so completely idiotic (and I like these actors/actresses) that this is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. Far worse than any of the famously bad cult/monster movies of the 50's-60's. never could understand how anyone could ever have thought this movie had any redeeming qualities, much less actually liked by anyone. The movie is so bad, it prompted me to register with IMDb to add my vote. Wish I could vote a zero...as in the movie never should have been made. Could not imagine a greater waste of time or talent."
"I am at a complete loss as to what anyone can see in this film. By it's very title it glorifies the days when ""story"" was a cheap and disposable commodity, and seeks to canonise it's lack of a script as a result. I'm sorry - ""anti-art"" has all been done before, and it wasn't very interesting with the dadaists back in 1915 either.Poor acting, a non-existent script, dialogue written by someone who thinks swearing still has ""shock"" value and endless, pointless violence. The burger discussion was the nearest thing to a highlight."
"Sam Peckinpah is a movie director from 1970s known for the strong dose of violence in his films. ""Dirty Harry"" series from the same era played by Clint Eastwood were not deprived of a good dosage of brutality either.So are ""Scarface"" and ""Body Double"" of Brian Da Palma from the 1980s. In all the above however, there was either a plot or a theme or at least some atmosphere with a musical score. On the other hand, lacking the essentials of cinematography, the violence in all Quentin Tarantino signed stuff is so excessive and over exaggerated that it becomes simply pointless and void. A young couple takes on a journey and start a spree of serial killings just for the fun of it as in ""Natural Born Killers"". One of kidnappers approach teasingly the abducted cop and slowly slices off his ear while singing and making dance gestures as in ""Reservoir Dogs"". Still in this one, a big fat black man is being forcibly raped by an effeminate looking blond man while in the next scene a man entering the room carves up one of the captors with a sword. Still in another scene, having been shot in the groin, a man groans with pain holding to his blooded genitals. Now I don't see where is the fun of in all these. More important, where is the art in all these so that almost all Q.T brand films have earned such high ratings ? Apart from the frequent humdrum dialogs such as ""yep"", ""yeah"" , ""right"" and a lot of profanity and abusive remarks, what is the idea behind? That violence and sordidness have become an integral part of American society ? Well, after all that is their choice and they have to live with that, but at least don't sell this crap to elsewhere. If you watch historical or war films or genuine mafia/mob genre by masters such as Scorcese or Dilaurentis or Coppola, blood and gore unavoidably creeps in. However, there is a lot more than simple violence in them unlike the vulgar and infamous Q.T make. I might sound a bit outdated by our modern society standards, but somehow I don't fancy that type of meaningless brutality and gore committed by tacky small town psychopaths in confined settings such as warehouses or obscure small shops or drab U.S highways."
"First of all my comment doesn't have spoilers because there is absolutely nothing to spoil. I intended to watch Pulp Fiction & Reservoir Dogs after I seen Kill Bill Vol 1 & 2 which I really liked because of the same director Quentin Tarantino. He became my favourite director after I seen Kill Bill Vol 1 & 2 but no longer when I seen Pulp Fiction. It has all the possible bad things in a film and the list is endless. There is nothing but drug use and swearing that made my ears bleed, the F word was repeated more times than the number of heartbeats of a person's lifetime. None of the stories were appealing...in fact I just don't know what's going on because there was no structure or plot. The film was about 2.5 hours and I hated every second, it was Extremely boring that I had a sore head & I felt like ripping my arm out and constantly bash my head with it. Anyway I can go on forever.I just don't know why it's #5 on the IMDb top 250? Maybe because mostly people have accidentally clicked on 10 instead of 1 out of 10. Quentin Tarantino must have pulled the script from his bum and was running about in a circle with it then his wife must of hit him on the head with a rolling pin and said, ""You promised me no more rubbish films!"" He must of found a brain in a fruit bowl before he made Kill Bill he also looks like a idiot and talks like a girl. Now I don't intend to watch Reservoir Dogs. Crap Fiction is now definitely on my top 5 worst films of all time and is in second place. First is either Jackass the movie 1 or 2.It is critically acclaimed because 97% of critics have no brains and the rest of the 3% have cheated in their exams. That is why they always give good reviews to bad films and bad reviews to good films. Overall no matter what ever happens there will never be a worse film than Crap Fiction. Any movie in the IMDb bottom 100 is better and I would like to salute anyone who has given it a 1 out of 10. This whole comment is only 1% expression of hate to this stupid, crap, junk, garbage & good for nothing film."
"This is, in my opinion, the most over-rated film of all time. Sure, there is some snappy dialogue here and there, and Tarantino has a good ear for music, but none of this warrants the gushing praise heaped upon this movie, nor the godlike status bestowed upon Tarantino himself.It's over-stylised, over-loud, over-acted, (sorry Samuel, Tim, John, Uma & Bruce) and the non-linear narrative so favoured by the director simply doesn't work.But it's fashionable, so it's popular.By the way, this is one of the few films where I've actually seen people get up and walk out of the cinema before the end, so I guess I'm not the only one who didn't like it."
"I personally find this film to be a milepost on the decline of American society.This is a film in which paid murderers are our heros, who endear themselves to us with witty banter between their bloody exploits.  It features such entrancing scenes as countless murders, S&M rape, drug overdose, and other fun things to watch (it's a wonder Six Flags hasn't opened a thrill ride to capture the whole experience).  It features all manner of completely unredemptive characters doing cruel, inhuman, or brutal things to each other.  Is this entertainment?The last straw for me was when a young man was accidentally shot dead by our irascible heroes--  the big problem posed by this is 'how will we clean out the car?'  What can you say about someone who views human life so cheaply (hit men or no)?  What can you say about someone who finds such spectacle to be entertainment?The characters here are completely dehumanized, uncaring about the horrors they inflict on one another, and ironically, much of the audience must be equally dehumanized to accept these characters as the 'good guys.' If Tarantino is the genius this film led people to believe, that would have to be his point, wouldn't it--that to enjoy this movie you would have to be, in some way, sick?"
"Yes, that's right. Crap. This film is just that. If you take a closer look at f.ex. Bruce Willis, who seems to make people scream their head off every time he's near the screen, you can clearly see that this person lacks personality. He has two expressions: One that says ON, (with a little wrinkle above his nose) the other is of course OFF, when he's asleep. a machine of a man, which perhaps cries a bit when he comes home, because he's in desperate need for a personality, some feelings, a higher IQ and an even bigger paycheck.Why this person has become so popular has to do with you mindless people out there. Voting, cheering and stamping your feet for talentless and retarded actors, musicians, artists etc. That is why this world goes straight down the toilette. Making your modern remarks that everything is so ""Cool"" all the time.Pulp Fiction is at best a bad joke from a below average director. There is no inventions, no good or natural acting, no deeper meaning with this movie at all. Just exploitation.The era of good movie-productions are long gone. Classic actor's like Chaplin, Bogart, Cooper, Peck, Holden and Quinn don't get born any more. Today it's just you gray and unpersonalized people out there (With some exceptions), watching to see if there's something that can kill your brain even more, with splatter and gore above your ears. Yeah, you're a really ""cool"" bunch, drowning on dry land."
"The overwhelming praise for this film is beyond my comprehension. While it has a handful of darkly funny moments, and a fair splash of style, it's episodic, tasteless, sometimes downright disgusting, and far too quirky to make a good film.It has so many elements critics decry at every opportunity as the things which prove ""holywood"" is completely out of touch with it's audience that it brands most as hypocritical. Seems to prove it's not the sex, drugs, violence, and vulgarity that critics actually object to, but simply the package they come in.This is basically dreadful sludge masquerading as hip!"
"I saw this movie on video, after hearing all sorts of movie critics praising Tarantino's masterful use of ""multiple narratives"" in this film.  I suppose I was expecting something along the lines of ""Rashomon,"" which was probably setting my expectations too high.  There are three story lines (two and a half really--the Tim Roth-Amanda Plummer story is not sufficiently developed), only one of which is really interesting: the final story, revolving around Bruce Willis.  And that story takes up maybe one-quarter of the movie.  The remainder is filled with the John Travolta-Uma Thurman story line, which would have been interesting in the hands of a more talented writer or director than Tarantino.  The most interesting character is Keitel's--a great movie could be made of him, but he is on screen for only about ten minutes.  Tarantino does a nice job of exploring the ""banality of evil, but the ""hard-boiled"" dialogue is more often artificial and embarrassing, and when he runs out of expletives, he resorts to violence. As for the multiple story line concept, it's wasted here.  Tarantino actually did a better job with interweaving multiple story lines in ""Reservoir Dogs"" (another flawed film, but for different reasons).  And regarding what's in the briefcase--ultimately, who cares?"
"OK, so I just finished watching this flick and I found it to be upsetting. I am 20 years old and I heard so many good comments about Pulp Fiction. I purchased it and thought I would love it because I like gangster and shoot-em-up movies, like Boondock Saints and Scarface. However, I do have a disliking of Quintin Tarantino, I hated the Kill Bills and I just don't like Quintin Tarantino as a person. I feel like the movie lacked motivation and moved slow until the last twenty minutes. There were several plot gaps that left me hanging and the twisting story line that was supposed to be theatrical was just stupid and unattached to any part of the movie. The only saving grace for this film was the fact that it had an all star cast. I'm sorry if you disagree and you all probably will but this movie JUST SUCKED!!!"
"Try this experiment : Ask any tarhead or Pulp fiction fan one thing about this movie, and the first thing they will reply offhand is the incredible number of f words (271) found in this, and of that being the largest amount in any movie in history. So it may not seem unreasonable to conclude that this movie's incredible popularity stems from preteens and teenagers who think that the f word is cool and hip. Doesn't paint moviegoers in the best light does it? While I liked Reservoir dogs and Kill Bill 1 and 2, I simply cannot understand how this movie was voted into the top 10 or maintains such a huge fanbase? Dogs and Kill Bill were both groundbreaking and Tarantino flicks themselves may be a kind of acquired taste but there is enough offensive material in this movie, totally wanton, to put anyone off. Overall it is nothing special and outstanding.Now since some of his other movies were really good, Tarantino must have obviously done something right in Pulp fiction. So what could have possibly been that makes this movie so popular? Realism - Like all his other movies, this movie is very realistic. But there aren't enough outstanding scenes where realism adds an extra touch. There are only scenes of violence, extreme and explicit drug abuse, sodomy and boring conversation. The open use of racism can be considered realism but it is simply so easy to implement if one wants to.Dialog - Mostly long and highly trivial. French McDonalds, killing people, coffee...wtf? You can only make something great out of it only if you overanalyse the dialog and then put your self in a delusion of being a great analyst or philosopher. Too many f words, n words and racist lines. This is not cool, kids. Its garbage. Or I guess that a lot of people converse on trivial lines and it is uplifting for them to see the same type of boring talk in a big movie? Acting - Pretty good but once again, there are too often uttering long and trivial dialog. None of the characters are likable or even dispiseable to the extent that they have such depth. They were all pretty shallow.Plot - Mostly nonexistent. You could probably extract a story of redemption from it but too many people put all sorts of philosophical angles which were simply not intended. A bunch of different chapters intersect at one point. Harvey Kietel's character is pointless and is just thrown in as a deus ex machina. Tarantino's character and dialog are also pointless.Actions scenes, special effects, twists and all that - None. Most scenes are well done but they simply boring. A simple scene well done but nothing special happening in it.One teenager probably goes and tells another teenager how cool this movie is for nothing other than its explicit use of offensive elements (drugs, violence, sodomy, bad language) and he tells his friend and so on, the chain reaction makes less than mature minds fall for this movie. When someone speaks out against how bad this movie really is, they are labelled as idiots so are afraid to speak their mind. I'm glad that 225 reviews here were at least accurate. Screw the peer pressure and speak your mind, kids.Sorry, this anti-movie just leaves more of a negative impression than any positive. It also drags too much. Its quite revolting although some scenes are quite memorable."
"What is the big deal with this movie?  The movie SO boring, uninteresting, and full of a bunch of moronic and trashy characters.  I just don't get why people like this film so much.  It truly saddens me that this film has, for some god-awful reason, made it into IMDB's top 250 (and currently top 20). This film is most definitely in my bottom 250.Here are some of the many problems I had with this film:The scene where Bruce Willis' character was first introduced is one of the most visually painful scenes I've ever seen, I was ready to turn the movie off right there.  The camera just sits there on Bruce Willis' face and doesn't move for what seems to be an eternity.  What on earth was Quentin thinking?The best way to describe this movie is ""just a bunch of STUFF"", there's no real plot here and the story doesn't go anywhere?  I found it really hard to give a SH*T about any of the characters, and I couldn't care less if any of them got shot or killed.What was with that scene where Uma Thurman's character says ""Don't be a square"" and she forms a little square with her hands (If you haven't seen the movie then you won't know what I mean)?  That was so STUPID!!!  I just don't get stuff like that.  Too weird for me. ...And people call this a comedy?  Where the f&*k is the comedy?  Is it supposed to be funny when they go over the speed bump and shoot the guy in the back seat?  That isn't funny, that's SICK!  The only part that I laughed at was when John Travolta and Sam Jackson were talking about eating pork/bacon.  I thought that was a pretty funny conversation, but other than that I didn't find the movie funny at all.I'll never say ""don't waste you're time"" while referring to a movie, cause everybody has different tastes. So if you feel so inclined, go ahead and watch it, but I HATED it.  I hope you enjoy it more than I ever will. Thanks for putting up with my ranting and raving,-Chris"
"This film stands out like no other as an utter piece of sh!te. When I see all the accolades and devotion that film receives it makes me want to vomit not only all the bile in my body, but the blood that is contained in it as well.Pulp Fiction, is a testament to our downward spiraling American society. It is a monument to the shallowness, the arrogance, and vapidness of our self-obsessed culture that dwells in the American consumer mind. Only in America, a talentless director whose only ability is to plagiarize greater works can become the most celebrated creator to ever enter film-making.But you can't say a word because his following is ravenously sycophant. They know ever word, every phrase, every bit of dialogue. But they certainly don't know the difference between the real deal and a cheap imposter. Sam Pekinpah never sat down watched a slew of movies and said I'm gonna steal this scene or that dialogue from this movie and directly put it in my movie. Nope he created his own stuff. He may have sat down and wanted the same feelings to be interpreted in his films, but never exactly the same way. Neither did Sergio Leone, John Carpenter, George Romero, Ringo Lam, Bo Arne Vibenius, Simon Nuchtern, The Shaw Brothers, Joseph Sargent, Akira Kurosawa, François Truffaut, or even Robert Aldrich. Even George Lucas, after the atrocities that he has committed to his own films in later years has done this.Most of the names that mentioned are probably unmemorable or unrecognizable to most people, but they are in fact only a few in a very long list of directors whose have been stolen by Tarantino (except, of course, George Lucas - so far anyway).Anyways that does not mean his movies do not have merit. The earlier ones like Pulp Fiction are laded with quirky and funny dialogue. But thats all they have because plot, characterization, and substance have gone out the door. Tarantino can't even tell you a linear story. He uses a disjointed structure to hide the weak plot. He uses clever dialog to take place of decent characterization. In fact, the funniest thing to me is that his seem to have a non-stop spouting of words, they never seem to stop talking, but in the end they never really have anything to say."
"The comments for ""Pulp Fiction"" generally fall into one of three categories: 1) ""Awesome Dude! The best movie ever!"" raves that offer zero supporting analysis, apparently written by Gen-Y homeboy wanna-bes raised on ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" sequels; 2) more considered, thoughtful raves praising the unconventional structure and 'hip' dialogue; 3) absolute horror that such violent, profane trash was ever made in the first place. I am much closer to #3 than the other two.
I had read about ""Reservoir Dogs"" (but not seen it) when ""Pulp"" was released. I went to see this with an open mind, before all the hype erupted. I almost walked out during the Gimp scene. I found this movie impossible to enjoy, because it seemed to revel in sadism, profanity, and cruelty, and I could find not one character to identify with. The whole film was simply unpleasant and repulsive - I just cannot find humor in graphic, casual murder. ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Seven"" are favorite films of mine, so I do not buy the 'go back to Mary Poppins' routine from many of the defenders of ""Pulp"". I think the audience (and possibly Tarantino himself) simply gets off on seeing people like this go about their business - it is a vicarious thrill. I have known some lowlifes in the real world, and it is most decidedly NOT fun. What genuinely scares me about the overwhelming praise that ""Pulp Fiction"" has received from critics and viewers is that there is zero empathy for the various victims of violence in this movie - they are regarded as mere props, not human beings.***SPOILERS*** One thing that has always bugged me, story-wise, is the scene in Butch's apartment with Vega. It makes no sense that a guy who is a professional killer would leave his weapon in plain sight, out of his reach, while he 'relieves himself'. I do not care how whacked out he is, in hostile territory he simply would never do that.***END SPOILERS***Everyone who praises Tarantino as the greatest filmmaker of a new generation - educate yourself a little about film. The overlapping storyline thing is nothing new (""Rashomon""), neither is using scatological monologues and non-stop profanity in place of actual dialogue (""Scarface"", for one). Let Tarantino write or direct something where the characters' primary means for self-expression is not gunfire, then we can talk."
"This movie is definitely the most overrated piece of sh*t ever.No story, no plot, no message, just Tarantino so totally in love with his own ""witty"" dialogue.The movie is empty in every sense of the word. In addition, it's also horribly boring and therefore ridiculously hard to watch. I always try to sit through every movie I start, but damn, with this one it was a hard task not to simply get up and walk away.Pulp Fiction does not deserve to be on top of IMDb's list of best rated movies with actual masterpieces like ""The Shawshank Revenge"". The latter is a work of art, Pulp Fiction is merely a piece of sh*t dressed up as one and it's amazing how many people fall for it."
"This film typifies what is wrong with the whole film world today. When a morally bankrupt,intellectually challenged creep like the ""director"" of this piece can get a deal with a major studio it says a lot about the sad and pathetic state of movie making. The level of hype surrounding this and the other (place epithet here) made by this twerp is disgusting. What drugs are being passed around in Hollywood board rooms? I'd really like to know what kind of hallucinogenic it was. I saw this (place epithet here) and I was disturbed in the way it manipulates the stupider members of the audience. Getting high on violence is a good thing? Tarantino is a cancerous festering oozing lesion on the anus of the film world. Good film making technique aside, are we really prepared for the level of nihilism this kind of (place epithet here) represents? This is just (place epithet here) elevated to Olympian ""ART FILM"" status. The presence of some reasonably good actors just proves that actors generally have very poor judgement and like the misquote of Hitchcock ""are cattle"". This, and the previously mentioned disease's other films are the absolute ultimate in pandering to the lowest common denominator of the hormonally challenged adolescent male mindset that Hollywood seems to be pervertedly in love with (film school critic retards included). This is only my opinion, but I know other cinema literate people who share it. The fact that this was nominated for Oscars is too abhorrent to bear. Add style and you can serve overrated (place epithet here) to the most pretentious."
