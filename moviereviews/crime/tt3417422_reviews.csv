"A family, their joy, their pain, their emotions, and their struggle. There are nail-biting scenes that will blow your mind. There are sizzling moments which makes you think overnight. There are Heartbreaking plot twists which makes you upside down. This is an amazing story. A great movie which can be included in the top of any lists. Jeethu has proved his ability once again. And, of course Mohanlal proved once again he is the real 'superstar' of the industry. This movie has some great performances. This is Mohanlal at his peak, Jeethu Joseph at his best. The rest of the crew especially, Meena, Siddique, and Kalabhavan Shajohn, they seem really bonded to their respective characters and are really amazing. The movie can be considered as the best of this year. This is really out of box, and i am completely out of my words."
"Drishyam is directed by Jithu Joseph and casts Mohanlal in the Main role.It starts of like a normal film but by the interval you will be enthralled by the epic twist.As the trailer never showed much about the movie,you will be shocked by the twist.The BGM is excellent and provides a very good backing for the movie.Mohanlal is at his very best and Jithu Joseph continues his success from ""Memories"".I can't tell you much about the story as I might spoil it for you.You MUST watch this movie RIGHT AWAY! and I promise you that you will be very content.It's the first time that I have Stood up and gave a standing Ovation for a film that I have watched but I wasn't alone,nearly everyone in the the theatre joined in.You will be going back home with a smile on your face,happy that you could witness such a film."
"Indian Cinema is not just Bollywood. It has a number of regional languages to deal with, and each region contributes it's share. As for Mollywood(Malayalam movie industry), it was one of the most prominent contributers for Indian Cinema. Big names like Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Shaji.N.Karun are internationally acclaimed directors and actors like Mohanlal and Mammootty are the gems of Indian movies. Recently, Mollywood produces movies which are intolerable in quality, but still there are movies like Dhrishyam which will provide us sheer joy about our movies.We grew up by watching movies of the big M's and we are proud of their potentials. We were also disappointed with their recent products which were dull and boring. Some say these actors were not meant to be working on Malayalam, instead they should work on some high-level industry. They also complains that here, we don't have much opportunities too. But we do make our merry with what we got, and Dhrishyam is one of those movies which utilized every bit of resource that provided by our industry. The story is about a common man who tries to protect his family from a mishap, which took a young man's life. The script is good , and direction is also impressive. What makes Dhrishyam brilliant is that the unique performance of the lead actors. Mohanlal, famous for his flexible acting skills, dazzles as Georgekutty, a farmer-businessman who cares about his family through every event of the movie. Meena, Asha sarath were also good to watch. Shajon, normally type-casted as a comedian, Makes a brilliant turn-over to a character role.As a final word, Dhrishyam is becoming a cult classic in Indian Cinema, and it spawns a new genre family crime thriller. Watch it. You'll never get disappointed..."
"What make the movies Shawshank Redemption, Next Three Days and Ocean's Eleven great thrillers and what drew fans worldwide to the TV show Prison Break These are all stories about a master plan, a master plan to do the impossible and its flawless execution considering every little details. Except George Clooney's Daniel Ocean all the protagonists in above movies/series were simple men. A Banker, a School Teacher and an Architect with no criminal history. They lived their normal lives until they were forced to do the impossible. George Kutty's story go by the same logic. If I dare compare Dhrisham to Shawshank Redemption (which incidentally is my all-time favorite movie) not much need to be told about the quality of the script, the direction and the performances. Dhrishyam is Mollywoods entry to world class family thrillers. For the entire second half of the movie Malayalam Cinema was elevated to the class of Hollywood. We had several art films or those parallel movies to brag about, but until Dhrishyam not many thriller or family drama type movies of Malayalam could have been called world class. Though the last 15 minutes of the movie went very predictable, Jeethu has managed to keep his audience at the edge of the seat for more than an hour and except die hard Mohan Lal haters, who would be too intimidated and upset for all wrong reasons; it's hard to find anyone who may complain about the movie."
"i would give 100000/10.if i can.. Lalettan's acting was spectacular. actually every actors did their job fantastically even the kids. its a beautiful scripted movie by Jeethu Joseph.oh god i really loved this movie. while watching most of other Malayalam thrillers,some time we get bored. and in the case of this movie we wont take our eyes from the screen. trust me you wont regret about money you spend on ticket. the movie contains a lot of suspense. the climax really shocked me. i was clapping with standing in the theater.as i mentioned above every actors have acted way beyond their level. i must say something about Kalabhavan Shajon. i didn't know he has such talent in acting.he really shocked me with his negative character. Asha Sarath,actually i didn't like her that she acted in TV Serials, but i became a fan of her.she acted very brilliantly in Dhrishyam. I'm not getting into the story, i don't want to ruin the suspense.you can watch it with the family."
"Watched Mohanlal starer Drishyam directed by Jeethu Joseph. When was the last time you come out of the theater saying 'Wow, Excellent.. What a Movie' ?? Yes.. Time has come. Drishyam is cracker of a thriller movie.Mohanlal is so elegant and wonderful as George Kutty. Jeethu Joseph Oh man.. Please add my name in your fan's list. U are awesome.. Great going Jeethu.. Nice Camera and BG score make this movie memorable one..Not going to story part. Better(Must) watch in theaters. Brilliant Screenplay and Cleverly directed movie. Brought Goosebumps at climax scene. Well supported by Meena, Siddique, Asha Sharath etc.. Kalabhavan Shajon is awesome in his negative role."
"The trailer did not prepare me for what lay in store at the theater. I was expecting a Sathyan Anthikad melodrama, even though many people had vouched for the movie's excellence. The first half panned out in a very formulaic way, with a happy family and a song added to make the proceedings look increasingly ordinary. The second half is what would take your breath away. For the first time in my life, I saw people standing up and give a standing ovation when the movie ended and mind you I was among the people who were applauding. The standout performers were Asha Sharath and Kalabhavan Shajohn, with Mohanlal recreating some of his old magic which I had not seen since the dawn of the millennium. Baby Esther also gives a fine performance and do not forget to look out for Anthony Perumbavoor who provides a comic touch to the proceedings. Overall a fine movie which shows that Jeethu Joseph's movies will be wanted by all top actors in Malayalam henceforth."
"Never have I seen here in Mumbai a theater houseful for a Malayalam movie. The last time it was 60% filled was during Neelakasham... (2013).Starting with a scene so mystic in its own way, the movie starts with a flashback. Characters are brilliantly paced into the plot as we look into a a family drama scene forming. Things go sharp & spine-chilling when a crime enters the scene. It is followed by another crime ans so on. The 50 minute second half, which is also the most engaging minutes for any Malayalam cinema this year, steals the show and keeps us on the edge of our seats as the twists come up and up and up. The screenplay is to be thanked, along with brilliant writing and narration.Mohanlal is better in this role than his previous characters this year. His performance really pulls the audience towards him. Meena was a real treat and boy, can she act so wonderfully. Kalabhavan Shajohn is the real hero of this film which talks about a family's plight & tactic when one of the member's sanity is compromised. His performance, his air, his priceless countenances all are so pure, I was taken aback. He can pull off both comedic & serious roles with finesse.The adult jokes and how the stereotype of a typical family has died in this age of money and money is purely showcased in the dialogs. Sufficient humor, jaw-dropping climax and brilliant storytelling. It also questions justice and what a person should do at times like this. Although, the plot constantly makes the family look as protagonists in spite of their crimes and falsely guides us what it intends to show us. But if you look closer, you will realize the climax answers all the questions about righteousness. Drishyam does not tell you how to act during brutal crimes, but it finely creates a hell of a story of the vicious happenings around us.Every single department is to be thanked, especially, art, location, lighting departments. The final output is full theater halls, favorable reviews and remake rights requests.BOTTOM LINE: If you haven't watched it yet, now is the time because it is still running in theaters. Probably one of the best movies this year. 8.5/10.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YESProfanity: No | Vulgarity: Mediocre | Sex/Porn/Drugs: No | Smoking/Alcohol: No | Violence: Critical | Gore: Mild"
"This is a true tour-de-force that has you gripped to your seat.It starts of gently, but don't let that lull you into a false sense of security that nothing much is going to happen - it is! And when it does, the tension doesn't let up.When I saw it the IMDb rating at the time was 8.9, which is very high. All I can say is that it is that high for a very good reason.Not only is it one of the best thrillers I have ever seen, but the cinematography is stunning. It captures the beauty of the location in such rich tones it is worth watching a second time just to admire the thought has gone into this. But it isn't just the large panoramic shots that are terrific, it is also the smaller sets such as the hotel where George goes for tea, and I don't know whether the director intended the contrast between the cold and clinical chief of police's house and the warmer tones of George's family home, but if they did then that was genius.If your heart is not racing by the end of the film you're not alive. Awesome!!!"
"Drishyam is an excellent thriller ever seen. The story revolves about how Georgekutty(Mohanlal) and his family save themselves from the hands of police. Jeethu rocks as a director as well as a scriptwriter. Mohanlal did perform well as a common man and Meena was stunning in her role as Rani. The child artists were really superb, especially the youngest daughter. Asha Sharath and Siddique did complete justice to their role. But the role of Sahadevan played by Shajohn was one of the notable characters. But the real hero of the movie was its climax. Some scenes in the movie were really made for standing ovation. My advice is to go for it!!!"
"I don't rate a movie 10 often. But believe me this is awesome. I sometime think why bollywood never make movie like this. This movie has entertainment value , its storyline is for a huge target audience and what a thrill. It can be easily compared with Rear Window, Vertigo or Dial M for Murder. Thrill thrill and thrill whats make this movie successful. Things that attract me most about Drishyam is the interrelation among the family members of Geroge Kutty (Mohonlal) and how far a man can go to save his family. Geroge Kutty is a very common man , maximum Indian can relate his lifestyle . I will not disclose more because it is good for you to watch the movie first and enjoy the experience."
"Finally got to watch this one earlier today, with a packed audience in tow, that was irritatingly loud, which was a huge problem for me, given there were no subtitles and I was straining to understand every nuance (I understand the language to an elementary extent, so that helped). What stood out? The fine performances. The close adherence / sticking to reality- based plot twists (for most of the running time, except while dealing with the macguffin on occasion). The locations (Kerala, Kerala, Kerala - one of the loveliest places in India). The comedy and the camaraderie.What did't work so well? The in-your-face/manipulative score, nee, cacophony. Glossing over few impact-laden occurrences (Indian movies do this all the time, and this is not the worst offender in that department, relatively speaking).Conclusively, this will make my top list for 2013, but not right at the top. It is very heartening to see Malayalam cinema embrace, once again, performance-driven narratives such as this. To me, that's what differentiated them among the cinema of the south. Regardless of language, this kind of cinema needs nothing but encouragement, and I do hope if there is a remake, it stays close enough to the spirit of the original! 3 cheers to Jeethu Joseph and team."
"Awesome movie I have seen in recent time.. Excellent acting by Mohanlal.. Fantastic screenplay and the protagonist has been heavily challenged by the police enquiry.. which makes the movie so interested!! Everyone played their character very well.. Storyline is superb.. Should watch if you want to spend quality time..The way it was directed, oh you should definitely give huge round of applause to the director...Cons: very less entertainment stuff initial phase of the movie is little slowBottomline :- Awesome,Excellent!!!"
"Well... Is there a film that can find a Shawshank Redemption kind of climax??? There certainly is!!! yea...This is the film that has a jaw-dropping finishing credits in the entire Malayalam Film History. Jeethu Joseph has certainly carved a master-piece which makes us wonder ""How can this story be possible??"". The script of ""Recreating a day"" is simply awesome and the length of the film which never loses its thriller touch has won million souls. An ordinary cop and common man quarrel goes to an extent which no one can ever guess..... You can watch this film 10 times for its final credits. The film has a good camera positioning, no boring songs and a complete 160 mins Drama Thriller.....What else do we need??? This film is the heart and soul of Malayalam Films....Never ever miss this!!!"
"This movie has now been released in every Indian language conceivable. I had to decide which language to see it in.
I chose Malayalam.
My first Mohanlal movie. My first full Malayalam movie. And what do i get. A mind-boggling movie.
Meena, the two girls, the policemen, the shopkeeper all contributed. But the cake goes to Mohanlal who breezed his way thru. Effortlessly. Even surprising how cool he is in tense situations.It teaches you one very important lesson- family comes first. Not FB. Not Twitter.Absolutely loved the movie. Even surprising considering I dont know a word of Malayalam."
"I saw Drishyam﻿ again...wow what a movie.....but ente manasamadhanathinu oru FIR... Jeethu Joseph﻿, an avid thriller fan saw Kahaani﻿ n liked it and read abt it on wikipedia and then found that Sujoy Ghosh﻿ hs been signed by Balaji Telefilms﻿ to do a sequel and whm coincidently had the rights to Keigo Higashino﻿'s The Devotion of Suspect X﻿....and obviosly jeethu didn't read it but instead (?downloaded and ) watched Suspect X﻿...(he may hav or haven't seen Before and After﻿ ) and then sat down and wrote his most successful work till date....well jeethu's contribution is a bloody brilliantly written first half and the key to his directorial genius lies in his mastery of subtlety and by creating the illusion for underestimation....great job...We cant inspired without being inspired and ones contribution is the master stroke..."
"Undoubtedly Drishyam is the best Malayalam movie in recent time. A combination of mystery, suspense and family drama made this film an eternal classic.First half was full of character development and was nothing more than a sathyan anthikkaad family drama. It is the extraordinary second half that makes this movie an unbelievable product of Malayalam cinema. Get ready to bite your finger and hold your breath while Drishyam takes you to a thrill ride along with its characters. While watching it in theater audience were cheering and applauding for Georgekutty and his family. The brilliance paid by uneducated Georgekutty in hiding the crime and creating fake proof and witnesses was the soul part of Drishyam.This movie has been controversial for spreading a wrong message. But I believe Drishyam delivers a strong message of strength and willpower of a family in times of oppressions. A rare piece of brilliance that Malayalam film industry can always be proud of."
"""Drishyam"" one of excellent movie till released in Malayalam film industry....! gr8 effort put forward by all the team members..! Mohanlal is so elegant and wonderful as George Kutty...! Brilliant Screenplay and Cleverly directed movie..! Drishyam is a deeply layered duel between truth and lie. By placing an uneducated, harmless farmer and his family on the one end and cops at the other, Joseph sets the right tone for a riveting conflict. A family comes face to face with a crisis that could rip them apart. The crisis is sudden, unexpected and shattering. What ensues is not a meek submission to fateMohanlal owes this film to Jeethu Joseph, completely. His portly frame, his drooping shoulders, his flitting glances find a glowing reincarnation in a character named George Kutty. He plays a father and a husband like a man. He struggles and suffers with his rugged endurance. This is a film that switches genres every second.""Drishyam"" an awesome thriller movie..!"
"On the whole, Drishyam is a complete package. It thrills, its emotional, worth your money and time. Don't miss to watch this movie.Mohanlal as Georgekutty is too good in his character. Some expressions of this legend reminds us why he is still staying at the top of the Indian actor list. Meena as Rani makes a good comeback with her role. The child artists enacting the roles of Anju and Anu have done their roles exceptionally well.Another notable performance is by Kalabhavan Shajon in the role of Sahadevan, a police constable. The negative character of Sahadevan is sure to gain Shajon a lot more opportunities in the coming years. Other characters including Siddique (Prabhakar), Asha Sarath (Geetha), Varun (Roshan) Irshad (police inspector), Kunjan (Madhavan) have done complete justice to their roles."
"The movie takes the route of a thriller without announcing itself as one. That and the well etched out main characters play the major role in making this a to-be-watched movie. The title that refers to the character-less actor is spot-onPositives: Story telling by Jeethu Joseph (loved his previous venture: ""Memories"" ) is fantastic. He should continue directing his own scripts. Fantastic ""common man"" acting by Mohanlal. I believe he went one notch up from ""Evidam Swargamanu"". Kalabhavan Shajohn excelled in his role. His police character was etched out well and there is a sequence in the movie where he sends down some shivers. Asha Sharath's acting in the top post police role was well-done. And a well-written story-line. And a super-duper last sequence.Negatives (the only one) - Movie takes some time to take off.A must watch in theaters"
"Drishyam stands out as the most beautifully made and executed film in this decade. Not only for its nail biting screenplay or for its vivid portrayal of the emotions , nor for its perfection in the technical aspects but for the way that it stands out from the rest of the films as a conventional viewer-go by film to a completely outstanding thriller that nobody will be able to top. Drishyam will be forever remembered as the film that would take us on a lag run throughout but stops and then takes a U-turn to completely takes us into another direction. The climax was impeccable, which without would have been devastating. Jeethu Joseph has wrote an never able to top screenplay and the theme on which the film builds is outstanding as any Hollywood movie. Drishyam was well versed from the beginning. With an beautiful story and a shrouded cinematography, Drishyam sucks you right in as the film starts. The acting, the score, the technical aspects were all top- notch although lagging is a factor that even Jeethu can't avoid. Mohanlal was outstanding as his role as a responsible father and as a able minded average citizen of our country. Meena has also essayed her role profoundly, leaving almost no gaps for the critics to ponder through. Drishyam is a sole masterpiece that should be experienced by everyone. From the technicalities to the story, it is a complete package from the start to finish.9.6 / 10 Visuals Can Be Deceiving !"
"Drishyam, for me, is the greatest Malayalam investigative thriller movie ever and I have my own reasons. First of all the way the pace of the movie was excellent. The first half going rather bland to save the blast for the end, was just brilliant. The plot was building up to reinforce what was in store in the second half. The way they have showed how Georgekutty loved his family and the way he observed many minutia of the movies which he used to air through his cable TV and so on. Another specialty of the movie is how it separates itself from the clichés of the regular investigative movies which have come and gone in the past (and by that I meant all the South Indian and the Bollywood films). E.g the instance when the bloke, who took the nude video of Georgekutty's (Mr. G) daughter, coerces her to submit herself to his lecherousness and then she telling her mom about this was so pragmatic and realistic. The thread here is not new but the script manages to give the audience a new perspective to the situation. In some of the other movies of the same genre, you would be expecting the daughter to show up on her own and either she would let the guy take advantage of her and perhaps killing herself after that, or she would kill him in the first place. But they have portrayed the family to be so close and open among themselves that the only sane possibility was that the daughter keeps her mom in the light about the situation that she has found herself in. And that was what that happened. Next, the police constable Sahadevan character was simply awesome. People have pictured Shajon (the guy who played the role of Sahadevan) only as a comedian. But his character in this movie had everything but comedy and he was simply excellent. At the end of the movie, I really hated the character Sahadevan, at the same time developed a huge respect for Shajon, the actor. The character hated Mr. G and his hatred was visible in his eyes and actions throughout the movie, once the plot thickens. The way he beats up Mr.G's kids without mercy by the orders of the IG was received with much skepticism, on the grounds that a policeman who wants to keep his job would never beat up women or children. But in my personal opinion, the script was fully justified as his actions were as result of his overwhelming hatred towards Mr G and at that moment he didn't care about the consequences of his actions. And the IG character, whatever small role she played, has done a terrific job. She handled the role of a mom, with a missing child and a policewoman, who wanted to get to the bottom of the mysterious man missing case, superbly. For a change, this movie showcased police (not only a single person, but in general) to be a bunch of people with something in their upstairs, when they were able to figure out how Mr G was able to cover up his tracks. Next specialty of the movie is the way Mr G covered up the murder by creating alibis. The way he planted fictitious ideas in people's minds, and got them to vouch for him, was a true novelty. All these make the movie a treat for the brain, even though they went a bit overboard when Mr.G dug up the body from his courtyard and buried it in a different sight (presumably, all in one night) without anyone noticing it. Also the part where Mr.G confessed to the parents was something that could have been avoided in the otherwise almost foolproof script, but luckily not much damage done by that. In toto the movie was certainly up there - in quality, novelty and ingenuity. I really appreciate the attempt of the rookie director and his crew. I hope more movies of such uniqueness get made and featured in the future. Kudos!!!"
"I'm not really into contemporary Bollywood films, more into Indian films from the 1930s to 1950s so if I have a bias, it's that. I've read some reviews that state this is a remake of a novel; I guess 'adaptation' could loosely be described as a 'remake' but from what I've read by several people: it's loose at best and totally changes the plot--which, if one thinks about it: who cares? Nothing's original anymore. Someone is always borrowing from someone else--I'm sure the novel this is loosely based on could be found something before it as being similar etc., etc.,Anyway, except for some amateurish editing and 'dun dun dun' moments throughout in concert of the composition and silly scenes with slow motion (like with the female cop, I almost thought this was a comedy/parody or something--slow motion of her walking up to two dudes being tortured; slow motion of her walking down a hall;--come on! That's hilarious.), it was a good film. The main problem I got from this, and perhaps it's a difference in culture or what not but why is it that a boy (or young man) can secretly videotape a young girl and if he shows it to his friends, or posts it online, she's at fault and she is the one bringing shame to her family? I mean, at first I thought it was just a line the guy Sam gave to get a girl to have sex with him but her reaction to it confirmed that's how people would see it. She's in the privacy of her own home, supposedly, and he secretly videotapes like a rapey pervert and she's to blame? I watched the scene a few times, and then with the mother, it made it appear that she would bring shame to her family. Anyway...as I said: maybe it's cultural differences or perhaps I misinterpreted that part...I don't think so but whatever...I like a long film like any other film lover but this had way too many slow motion scenes and 'montages', mainly when the songs were playing. I know Indians enjoy long films but this had way too much 'empty air' throughout which made it sort of boring at times."
"Best triller film I ever watched. The film started quite normal, but the film turning outstanding trilling experience. The movie is amazing"
I would suggest this movie because it has all the elements that a movie must have. All the actors did well and not to forget the role by Kalabhavan Shajon. The story is very good. It certainly deserves a place in the top movies of the decade. The story has the plot similar to The Shawshank Redemption. The main part of the movie is probably the second half where the drama takes place. The movie becomes better and better on reaching the climax. The real part to watch is of course the climax. The climax is almost unpredictable that the viewer gets chills down their spine!! I suggest this movie to all those who love good Malayalam movies and not the action movies. I Give 9 out of ten for this amazing movie.
"The movie initially started an artistic note with few genuine laughs, like a family drama. Then I sat through the last one hour and 45 minutes absolutely thrilled and chilled. Although the movie drew heavy inspiration from a novel, the drama and the sentiments were nicely quantified and never seemed over-done. Not to mention the talent of superstar Mohanlal. His acting was yet superior because of the director who got such a talented crew on-screen and off. Not to mention the follow-on camera at the start.Anyone'll/should give a 10/10 to this but i give 9/10 because of its inspiration from the novel.Bottom line : MUST WATCH for all (except for a few scenes of police brutality/violence)."
"Drishyam (ദൃശ്യം) is a 2013 family drama-thriller Malayalam film written and directed by Jeethu Jospeh starring Mohanlal and Meena in the lead roles. The film starts with a tag line that ""Visuals can be deceiving"" and it actually lives up to it. George Kutty (wonderfully essayed by Mohanlal) is an orphan and 4th class dropout who is running a local Cable TV network. He is a big movie buff who watches movies in a much focused manner and many of his decisions are influenced by the same. The movie portrays good family moments where George Kutty tries to be stingy (he has his own justifications for the same) and his wife Rani (Meena) occasionally demands of shopping, enjoying movie in a theater and food in a restaurant.George Kutty, Rani and their two kids Anju (Ansiba Hassan) and Anu (Esther) together form a beautiful family picture until an unprecedented event hits them. The audience gets completely absorbed in the twist of events that begin to unfold from the end of the first half. The second half is more like a thriller and is about how the family, despite the vengeful villainy of a corrupt cop Sahadevan (Kalabhavan Shajon), stands its ground even as the law takes its course. The psychological cat-and- mouse game that ensues between George Kutty and the lady IPS officer Geetha Prabhakaran (Asha Sarath) has several moments that thriller buffs will dig into with delight. What is appreciable however is the adversary's acceptance of defeat, and the eventual respect that the two develop for each other. Prabhakaran (Siddique), husband of Geeta Prabhakaran also plays a vital role who seems to have non-biased approach. The movie doesn't try to justify what is right and wrong. It showcases the journey of a head of the family who protects his family by all means.Sujith Vaasudev was successful in capturing the visual beauty of Rajakkad-Idukki. Music scored by Anil Johnson and Vinu Thomas was good. The editor's table was safe with Ayoob Khan. Overall, the movie Drishyam has been packaged well."
"I would rate it as one of the finest Malayalam movies ever made. The biggest plus of the movie is Mohanlal as 'George Kutty'. He delivers a performance with such ease and grace that he takes the film to yet another level. Drishyam succeeds in making the viewer glued to his seats. So engaging the film was that everyone was glued to their seats. I feel bad for the people who claim the film is a remake, One could only sympathize them for their ignorance.Jeethu Joseph should feel proud of 'Drishyam'. Eagerly looking forward to the Kamal Haasan version of the film in Tamil. Wishing Jeethu the very best with his forthcoming ventures."
"The movie is a great commercial winner , a crowd puller. The plot is pretty deep , not something you see every other film. First half is a warm up for the movie, aimed at establishing the closeness of the family. The trailer is an eye-wash, giving the viewer the impression that the main protagonist is a simpleton, a deliberate attempt, I believe to prevent any anticipation. Viewer would feel the tension of the plot in the second half and the unlikeliness of it pulling through positively is always alive till a couple of brilliant twists seal the fate for good. The plot is one big winner in the movie.Asha Sharath, the malayalam serial actress, first time in movie has done excellent work. Mohanlal, Meena , the child artistes , the comedian who plays Sahadevan all have done great work.The movie is great, Jeethu Joseph has established himself firmer as a strong director in the malayalam movies."
"I am a big fan of movies in the Thriller/Mystery genre and this consistently came up in the best thriller movies list and the best movies of India list. I'm not familiar with the language so I watched this movie with subtitles. I won't go too deep into the plot as everyone should witness this on their own. Here, a man leads an ordinary and happy life, with his wife and two children, until an incident threatens the peace in their lives. This story is about how he copes with his circumstances and tries to protect his family.This movie was spectacular. The plot is written in a masterful manner and there are almost no loopholes in the script. The acting is brilliant and Mohanlal was great as the man of the household. He never once went overboard and portrayed all the emotions perfectly. He was supported well by his colleagues, who were all good in their respective roles. The antagonist, Sahadevan, portrayed his character so well, I had chills.I will recommend this movie to everyone who enjoys thrillers. An absolutely brilliant film!"
"He lives with a cabil TV business and a regular filmmaker, and his wife and two daughters and a family that lives closer to the first half of the film by describing the surroundings.With the first half of the story, the story goes on to the intensity of a crucial event and continues to move forward with the moves and obstacles to the audience.Georgy Kutty, who is also a student of the Fourth Class of Education, is very excited about the attempts to defend his family from his experiences with his own experiences.But we do not see a policeman who fails to appear as it seems in ordinary movies and behaves foolishly.It is amazing to see that everyone is intellectually watching the movements of the boy and trying to overtake the defenses which George Gottt is doing.George Gotta shocked the viewers with a one-pointed upper-level superintendent and even surprisingly shocked by the George.Finally, the film has become a stabilizing viewpoints with a decisive secret known to him only by the Georgy Kutty.The goodness of Mohanlal is what we see in many places.He was a police constable who made a milestone in the acting career of Kalabhavan Shazon.Asha Sharat took up the role of a police officer and Siddiq retained his stewardship.Sujith Vasudevan's camera is also very helpful in raising the map.Jeetu Joseph is very commendable to perform a very good and intellectual work and to bring it to the audience with a good view of the director's role."
"Undoubtedly One of the best family crime thriller movie ever made in malayalam. Excellent script by Jeethu Joseph and Mohanlal's performance make the movie far better that usual cliché thrillers in malayalam. Each and every actor of the movie deserves applause. Its a kind of movie that no one will regret after watching and will remain in memory for a lifetime. The first half of the movie is a family comedy drama which become an edge of the seat thriller in later half. Background score of the film is also good. Altogether the movie is one of the finest movie with finest title; Drishyam - Yes, Visuals can be deceiving"
"a decent movie which will hold you for 2 hrs n 44 minutes... Absolutely masterpiece, don't remember if i have seen any better movie.... Glad to see, even if i followed full movie with subtitles. a must watch n i highly recommend to all. I am a big fan of bollywood but in recent years bollywood is concentrating and is ranked according to its box office collection n sadly not by the film content. Soon bolloywood will showcase a copied version of Drishyam with the same name starring Ajay Devgan. I recommend you watch this before losing the chance to watch the amazing direction on this movie.... Each n every inch of the film is not to be missed, even the songs are worth watching n not less than anything the everygreen beauty of Kerala displayed to its perfection. Don't miss it"
"I first saw the trailer and I was not that impressed. Still I went ahead and watched the movie just because my friends and relatives compelled me. As the movie started I was able to guess the story and screenplay. It is surely not edge of the seat thriller at all. Any one with common sense and regular movie goer will guess what's going to happen next. This could happen in normal mas-ala entertainers, but they call it as edge of the seat thriller, but actually it is not. After the movie ended, I came up with two points which were logical loop holes. But no one was ready to listen because the whole society accepted the movie and declared it as a blockbuster. But later I came across this article where the director himself accepts that there are logical mistakes (Source : HTTP:// timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/Malayalam/movies/news/J eethu-Joseph-admits-an-error-in-Drishyam/articleshow/35212168.cms ) and he escapes by flattering the audience saying ""Kerala audience are really sharp"". Lol.. THis is a good movie, but definitely not a edge of the seat thriller and definitely not worth its praise. In Hindi, Whatever crap Slaman khan and SRK acts it hit, in Tamil whatever Rajni acts (Linga , Baba) they call it as hit, same with Malayalam whatever Lalchetta acts its hit and we call him a complete actor. He may be, but this movie definitely not worth the praise and hype."
"Some people say 'Drishyam', the best of Malayalam Movies ever,but actually a good recent Malayalam films. The Performance of Mohanlal as Georgekutty is amazing,reflects the full emotions of a common man (farmer/business man) who tries to save his family from the tragedy. Another noticeable Performance is by Kalabhavan Shajon as a Police Officer named Sahadevan. Background Score for the movie by Anil Johnson is also appreciable. 'Drishyam' is simply an investigative story,in the point of view of someone who committed the crime (Murder). This's how this movie differs from the same sort of movies directed by Jithu Joseph,'Detective (2007)' and 'Memories (2013)'. The Graphics/Visual effects are again very poor for the Jithu Joseph's film after 'Memories'."
"The story is heavily adapted from the Japanese movie Suspect X, penned by Keigo Higashino' and directed by Hiroshi Nishitani. The movie was surprisingly well-directed compared to drisyam. the strongest point of suspect X is the interactions of the two geniuses. jeethu Joseph just added some extra characters and some changes in the plot to suite to malayalam cinema. in the era of internet Its very difficult to stay undetected after stealing stories from foreign languages. The funny thing is this guy still not admitting his cheap 'copy - paste' act!! shame on you jithu Joseph. i give 5 out 5 for the outstanding performance of lalettan. Sujith Vaassudev's camera is outstanding."
"For a movie buff, who have watched several movies, its easy to guess whats gonna happen next. Not worth your time. The movie starts of very slow and the scenes are very draggy. Songs are also not catchy. Mohanlal acting is good. He is perfect for the role. Meena also has acted well. Artist Anu also acted well. But the story is very simple and is definitely not an edge of the seat thriller. The screen play is totally poor. Songs are not that catchy and trendy. In the scene when the bus conductor says, ""You are my friend, no need to get ticket"", any kid would guess that in scenes after that Mohan lal is going to make use of that situation. The entire movie is guessable. The only good part where screenplay is good is the place where mohan lal comes out of police station in climax. Just because last 2 mins is good, I can't say the entire movie is great."
"A tale of an ordinary middle class family residing in a hillside,almost free from the clutches of urban life.The family head,the father of two girls named Georgekutty,portrayed by Mohanlal,is a cable TV operator who sees a lot of movies from films of the 80s to Hollywood blockbuster movies to recent flicks by southern star Vijay. The family stumbles upon a crisis appeared in the form of a youngster who claims to have voyeur video of the young girl in the family.When the guy started blackmailing the girl and her mother for his own sexual gratification,they accidentally kills the guy and buries the body.Georgekutty,who wasn't present at the time of the murder,comes to know about the murder and decides to cover up the murder and thus save his family.What follows is how Georgekutty does this 'covering up' and fool the Police force and the victim's parents.From 'clever cover-ups' to making fake alibis,the protagonist does everything necessary to save his and family's tail from the law.And in the end he succeeds too.In thriller movies involves a murder ,the killer's or his helper's characters,if any, are suitably developed to match their deeds i.e killing and covering up the incident.They will be portrayed either as psychopaths or normal guys who has no other options other than kill their enemy(then makes some of mistakes in the process since they are inexperienced)Otherwise an average intelligent audience couldn't believe their doings.'Out of character' deeds would be rejected by the audience.They would think 'is he really capable of doing it'?This remains the main problem with the movie.The protagonist is shown as an average man who have no criminal history whatsoever.When he does things like destroying evidence,provides fake trails for the police,making fake alibis for his family...and thus creating the perfect murder...one would obviously raise questions like i have given above.The logic the director gives for his deeds is that he has watches a lot of movies and actually making various suggestions when he sees something technically wrong in the film.Yes..he is a Cinephile..A lot of movies are shown flashing in his mind and he is seen acting drawing inspirations from them.For an example,he has an epiphany about how to dump the victim's car.For this,he recollects how characters in a movie dumps their car and acts accordingly.Same goes for the scenes in which he destroys the victim's phone and Sim card.For this,the movie which helps him is Memories,the directors' previous movie which got released some months back.This is Self reference in the most inappropriate place.Its his movie experiences that drive his various deeds.I found this as a very poor excuse. If his character was developed accordingly,it would have been much more believable.But the director instead develops the character as an ordinary family man.Or in the other case, the director shouldn't have shown that the character studied those criminal acts form the movies.Jeethu does neither of that and that is the movie's major flaw.His character is morally flawed too and the director wants the audience to actually cheer for the murderer.The family too is shown no remorse for the murder.But since they are the central characters of the movie.we are forced to support them 'cleverly' hiding from the justice.They are shown as perfect human beings and the movie never actually addresses as criminals. One of the most harrowing scenes described by many is the 'beating on the police station' scene.A policeman,who already has a beef with the protagonist over very silly and forgettable issues and is so adamant of accusing him,beats the daylights out of the 'murder family'.He is also seen beating a very small girl and this whole incident is sponsored by a very high ranking police officer.Such scenes could only exist in the overly dramatic Malayalam movies.The scene is probably written to disturb the viewer's mind and develop hate towards the police officer who is ,ironically working for the Truth in the movie.But the scene actually acts as a pivotal scene,because the young girl reveals where they have hidden the victim's body.The entire police force rushes to the crime scene which is already flooded with the media and finds none because Georgekutty has already foreseen this incident and switched the body with a dead cow.The media and the entire village get enraged at the police officer and he had to run away from the angry people.The case is closed despite the fact that the small girl had already admitted the truth and clearly misguided the police.Again,,a scene which happens only in movies like this.But the thing that enrages me the most is that,the 'clever' Georgekutty could have easily avoided his daughter getting beaten if he or any family members had already confessed before the beating takes place.But he decides to choose silence and watch his daughter getting beaten by the heavy hands of a police officer.Bad writing maybe.but the director would have missed the chance of forcing the audience to sympathize with the murderers if this scenes was properly written.In the end,the victim's family members actually begs the murderer of their son for 'forgiveness' and decides to move abroad so that the case could easily wrapped up and the movie ends with a 'happy ending'.But they did ask the murderer about what actually happened the night of the murder claiming that they have the right to know so.Which our protagonist decides to avoid inhumanely and gives a speech justifying his and his family's deeds and heroically claiming that the truth will die with him and never comes out.The parents hearing this confession do nothing but cry thinking about their ill fate.The movie ends with one of the most ridiculous and laughably stupid scenes in recent times which i decides not to reveal here.Watch for yourself.So if you have no problems cheering for poorly written 'killer' characters (whose criminal acts are inspired by cinemas)..go and book your tickets."
Just amazing . No other words to say about this movie than calling it a masterpiece
"Nice movie with a bulky suspense, starts with a normal drama then suddently incident happens it totally turns to master plan event.
All the casts did so well especially M lal did extreme and he always seems natural.
A good family thriller , Good attempt Director."
"Reality movies and thriller movies don't collaborate easily. This one does the trick. Do not watch any other version of this movie. Watch it in it's own languge with the help of subtitles, like I did... You will love it."
"Drishyam, the malayalam movie is a masterpiece family entertainer and suspense thriller, with the most unexpected and thrilling climax ever in any movie in the history. If malayalam movies had an audience like hollywood or bollywood, this movie would have reached in a much higher ground by now. A must watch movie."
Flim excellently directed.100% makes you to edge of seats.
"Movie starts from showing of the an ordinary family of Georgekutty who is a cable TV owner. Till the interval, we feel like a pure family film where we could easily relate it with our family. One song before the interval also suits the mood of the film. Post interval, the film escalates to another level. A tragedy that happened in the family and the aftereffects of that with the family.
The story line was very well scripted and also very well directed. All the cast have done justice to their roles, but Kalabhavan Shajon needs to have a special mention because of his terrific performance as the antagonist. Music department was also good.
In short, Drishyam is a film where all family audience and all movie lovers can enjoy."
Shawshank Redemption-esque thriller with a slow pace and a plot twist that you won't see coming.
"I was watching this movie in theatres, first half, I thought it is a good family entertainer. But in 2 nd half movie took unexpected turn. Twist.. Twist.. Twist.. Such a thriller, with mind blowing scenes. Mohnlal was wonderful as George kutty, an uneducated but highly intelligent father trying to rescue his family from an unexpected crime that involved his family. This movie is surely a must watch for those who loves crime thrillers...!"
Phenomenal work by Mohan Lal.gggghhhfjfugjgktutyyhjkytjfigjghdugjjtiugrddeggfdgggfgjjfhf4777878677995889899994
"Good suspense thriller, excellent acting by mohanlal. A master piece from Jithu Joseph"
"Drishyam from Jeethu Joseph came out with average expectations, but the movie delivered something beyond what everyone expected. Anchored by Mohanlal as Georgekutty the story is about a father fighting for his family for a situation gone wrong.The beauty of this movie lies in the details and thinking done behind each & every scene. I would compare the thinking to a series like ""Death Note"" where both logic is given prime importance. Mohanlal essays his role brilliantly. Asha Sharat and Shajon have given amazing performances. The 2 children have also played their part very well. Weaving all the intricacies of the story into a simple village requires true mastery over script and that is on display here.The climax is one of the best in Malayalam. Special kudos to that."
I think both these movies are good but they are copies from a Japanese movie called Suspect X. I wonder if any reference has been made to that movie. I feel it is great that such movies are brought to the Indian public but there should be an understanding that there is an element of plagiarism involved. The Indian public deserve to know where and how much credit needs to go to the right people.
"Released on 19 December 2013 in Kerala, Drishyam received positive reviews with critics praising the screenplay, the performances and direction. It was the first Malayalam film to collect ₹50 crore from the box office. The film grossed over ₹750 million worldwide and ran for more than 150 days in theatres. It remained the highest-grossing Malayalam film of all time until it was surpassed by Pulimurugan in 2016. The film won numerous accolades including the Kerala State Film Award for Best Popular Film and the Filmfare Award for Best Film – Malayalam and screened at the 45th International Film Festival of India and the 8th Asian Film Festival . It was remade into four other Indian languages including Telugu , Tamil , Kannada and Hindi and is being remade in Sinhalese as Dharmayuddaya ."
"I have watched this movie at least 10 times and even after knowing about the climax(which is absolutely mind-boggling), I am still stunned by the near-perfectness of the plot. The cast performance was unbelievable but what set this movie apart is the strength of the story & kudos to director Jithu Joseph for that. The first half lets you enjoy the cheerful moments of Georgekutty & his family before taking an unfortunate turn when they commit an accidental crime. It is from here that the show truly begins. Each scene from the crime holds significance in the progress of the investigation which is commendable for a movie over 2 hours. But what really takes this movie to the peaks of greatness is its climax which will leave you spellbound and stunned.And of course there is another thing that leaves you equally astonished. The cast performance. This is Mohanlal at his absolute best. There are no scenes where he turns to a larger-than-life character. This is THE COMPLETE ACTOR at his absolute peak. He delivers each dialogue with stunning depth and incredible emotions. Some of his comical expressions in the first half is an absolute treat. Meena is the perfect wife for Mohanlal and she is nearly as good as the hero. The children do their parts wonderfully. Asha Sharath puts in an unexpectedly good performance as a police officer. But the biggest revelation is Kalabhavan Shajon. This is his career best performance. This will be an unforgettable character in his career. The rest of the cast also does well.When everything goes so perfect you surely will get a perfect movie. And that is what this movie is. The finest Malayalam actor has another classic to his collections.Cast performance- 10/10 Story- 10/10 Direction- 10/10 Songs- 9/10 Overall- 10/10"
"'Lalettan proved once again why he is the best actor of this generation. Jeethu Joseph proved he has talent to become the next big director. Drishyam proved family thrillers can also strike gold at the box office.'Drishyam is one terrific film which I missed in theaters. I watched it for the first time when its TV premier got telecasted. I watched it with a lot of expectations. At the starting it looked like a typical family drama. Was I disappointed at first? I think so! But only after the first hour, I realised that director was setting up the plot. The slow narration increased pace. The result was an outstanding second half. A surprising climax concludes the film.Drishyam is about how Georgekutty(Mohanlal) hides a crime committed by his family and protects them from the dark side of law. Of course the first half didn't give single clue about what would be the story. The characters were introduced in the first half. Cable TV Georgekutty,his Rani(Meena),Georgekutty's 2 daughters(Played by Ansiba and Esther.), Constable Sahadevan(Shajon kalabhavan),local tea shop owner, Lal's assistant(neeraj) were the characters who appeared in the opening hour. The characters were also given interesting character sketches. Georgekutty is a school dropout who is a film lover.He is a loving familyman. But he is called a miser by his wife because he is hesitant to spend money. Rani is a honest housewife who wants to live a luxurious life. Sahadevan, a policeman has hatred towards Georgekutty for some reasons. The daily life of hero is depicted at the first half. At the closing 10 minutes of first half a spoiled youth Varun enters. Certain incidents ends up in the killing of Varun by the hands of hero's elder daughter. Georgekutty is informed about it. The pre-interval scene shows Georgekutty standing near the plot where Varun's dead body is buried by his wife and daughter. Varun is the son of an IG(Asha Sarath).Our hero is sure his family had landed in deep trouble. He valued his family more than anything. He uses his underrated brain to rescue his family from trouble planning a wonderful escape path. He plays a tricky cat and mouse game with the police and he ended up winning outwitting the police.Wow the second half has terrific scenes which will stick yourself to the sofaset . Lal changed all the truths to lies and all the lies to truth. The plan of Lalettan was decoded by IG at a point. Win was guaranteed for the police. But the hero had a surprise.The screenplay,storyline stayed terrific and one of the best. The dialogues were superb especially in the 2nd half.Mohanlal delivered a perfect performance. Each movements of him had a meaning if you observed.He is the best. Meena ,Ansiba and Esther played their roles very well. Asha Sarath excels in her job. Geeta Prabhakar IG was a perfect role for her. Siddique does a good job too. Special mention to Shajon for his terrific makeover from a comedian to a cruel policeman. His performance deserves a great applause.Rest of the cast also dos good job.Jeetu Joseph narration style looked very slow at the start. But he was actually setting up scenes which would lead to a mindblowing climax. He has done great job in sketching the mind games. Camera-work was good. Editing was also good. Music was melodious but the BGM was outstanding. It added intensity to the whole drama. The film is one of the best in Indian cinema. The second half is outstanding. Lalettan had scored 100 out of 100 for his role. The climax sequences stayed out of the world.You will stay happy when you see the hero and his family stay safe at the end even though you may feel sad for a heartbreaken Geeta.Overall This film is a must watch for all those who wanted an edge of the seat thriller.East or west Lalettan is the best."
"Finally got a chance to see ""Drishyam"" movie so praised by across languages and its also remade in Kannada, Telugu and in making Tamil & Hindi.I wanted to watch it in either Telugu or Kannada but finally watched in Malayalam for its authenticity.Awesome, the climax was. We all watch movies and have this commonsense to predict as it happens. But always want that ""Oh F*ck, thats how it was"" moment.Purely a family drama & thriller. Its all about Director. Nothing much. Watch it."
"81% - Drishyam is considered to be one of the most varied Malayalam movies in this century. As it has variety, that doesn't mean it is perfect. it is quite an interesting film. Drishyam, as a normal film starts off with a family drama genre. The first half of the film will never capture the audience as already they have seen these type before. Also, the first half lacked a sustainable story and was slow paced where it felt that the director wanted to skip this part as fast as he can. There were many story lines where it was actually unnecessary to the plot. These problems are suffered until the great plot twist happens before the interval. After the interval, the film travels into another direction that no movie has gone before. It becomes fast paced, intriguing and exciting all the way until the end. As it ends, we can say that it has been long time since we have seen a great film."
"The story starts with little slower phase exposing all the characters initially and the regular family, professional life and his fondness towards movies of GeorgeKutty. In the first half the story goes through the usual life of a middle class man who is cable operator leads his usual life until one of his daughters goes to a nature club event and falls a prey in the hands of Varun who is a son of higher police official. The real play starts when George's daughter happen to kill Varun and George starts planning how to conceal that and save his family from the law. With characters of Sahadevan and Geetha Prabhakar one side and how George on the other side breaking all their leads in investigation keeps us on edges. Its a clean plot with no unwanted characters. But one thing that we can say is the justification of concept how Geetha learns all that has happened is not explained so clearly."
"Drishyam starts with scenes from life of (slightly eccentric) GeorgeKutty, a cable TV network owner in a remote village in Kerala. In the first half the film portrays the character of Georgekutty, his family and the village. This was convincingly done and the viewer can immerse to the world of GeorgeKutty very easily. In their life, something unexpectedly happens which could destroy the family forever and the family's struggle to get out of is the theme of the movie(I am not going to write any spoilers). The brilliance of the movie is that it leaves the viewer in suspense for the most part of the movie and the way it is done with the script and direction is simply awesome.All the actors were very good in the movie, but special mention has to be given to Mohanlal. In my opinion, he plays a big part in the movie's success with his superb acting.This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I have seen my fair share of Hollywood thriller movies (including most of IMDb 250) and I can say Drishyam is a world class movie on par with the top Hollywood thrillers."
"Drishyam is the biggest box office success in the history of Malayalam cinema. Though its box office exploits are nothing compared to Bollywood and a comparison actually shows what a small industry (in terms of audience and box office returns )Mollywood really is.It is an above average crime thriller. But the film takes an hour to get going. There is too much of Malayali village life and the banalities of a middle class existence in the first one hour. The director went out his way to show that this was an incredibly harmless and god fearing Malayali family who would never even hurt a fly.I guess the film was such an enormous box office success because it portrayed the fears of lower middle class malayalis and the fragility of their life in the face of a corrupt, ruthless and nihilistic elite.The film is quite suspenseful. But too many things are explained in the end. A lot was said about the twist in the film's plot, i did not think much of it.None of the actors including Mohanlal makes a great impact or anything.I guess this film really pulled at the hearts of middle class Malayalis and confirmed their opinion of themselves as essentially goofy and harmless people who are bullied by vicious police officers and the upper class.And the police force is also given a carrot at the end (they are portrayed as cruel until then) of the movie when the suffering head of the family delivers a short speech about his belief in the importance of the police force.Worth a watch, but you would be disappointed if you have seen some of the better crime thrillers from Hollywood.(5/10)"
"its been so long that Malayalam industry had a movie that rocked the box office after TWENTY 20(2009). Mohanlal who is one of the pillars of Indian cinema had a disastrous 2013 , till December. All his films were mere flops,but he just changed the outlook of the industry with his power packed performance in DRISHYAM,which emerged out to be the all time BOX OFFICE hit in industry. DRISHYAM was the first film to complete 100 days in UAE after TITANIC.The film which deals with crime and punishment,throws at a question to viewers ""DO ALL CRIMES NEED PUNISHMENT?"".The film has completed over 145 days ,still continues to run in packed houses Its also been remade to major languages in the country. Definitely its an answer to SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION ,from India"
"Only can watch the movie by sitting edge of the seat. This is a superb movie that's why it is going to remake in several other languages in India by territorial best actors. Jithu Joseph once again proved his skill to make Thriller movies after Memories, a outstanding movie acted by Prithvi Raj. And Mohanlal, one of the best actors in Indian Cinema once again proved his natural acting ability. The first 20 minutes may seems like normal Malayalam movie, but from 21 minutes, you will began to ask thousands of questions yourself for making guess, but final jithu Joseph won the game with unpredictable climax and 10/10 best sequence in climax. this should be one of the Indian movie everyone should watch."
"I am not a big movie bluff to see each Malayalam movie in a theatre. I wait patiently for the DVD to release and watch it at home. But after hearing loads of praises for this movie from people, i decided to try my luck and go to the multiplex to watch it.And boy oh boy it was a wise decision. Firstly , endless queues for the tickets, complete seats booked . Family crowd. Coming to the movie, it is one of the best, nicely crafted, amazing work by the story teller and the director to bring such a master piece on the celluloid. Acting wise, TOP NOTCH, Meena was a delight to see on screen, but the true player was Mohan Lal or Lalettan to be precise..Such an effortless act by the master himself.Brilliant movie, can be watched over and over again. Just like Manichithrathazu.!! :-)"
"Drishyam is a Family entertainer, In which superstar Mohanlal portray the character of Georgekutty a common family man struggling for daily breads. We can see Mohanlal completely as a down to earth Character without any stardom. Yesteryear actress Meena will seen pairing opposite with Mohanlal. It would for the 7th time that the successful pair, Mohanlal and Meena joining together for a project. The big two expectations behind Drishyam movie are Jeethu Joseph - After mega hit Memories. Mohanlal - From the stills we could make out the energy in him which was lacking in most of his recent movies.Film starts of showing Antony. He was there for some time and felt this guy will spoil the movie. But immediately came a simple intro of Lal which suited the movie. Then the film goes on with Lal's movie craze, his cable TV business and his family. Also his tears seeing Amaram's climax and saying dialog to Meena and all has come out well and it will make u to give claps to the two big M's. The film moves own with an interesting twist in the interval. The film stops with a big question mark in front of George Kutty on how he will save his family from the debacle that happened.2nd Half is all about Georgekutty's well planned attempts to save his family from the debacle that happened. Training his family towards it, and tying together all the loose ends. It is really thrilling and people are just glued to the screen through out 2nd half. Direction and script has been completely successful in getting the viewers completely engaged with the movie and it thrills us to the core. It is basically like a game which Georgekutty plays with the Cops based on what he has learn from the movies. The game ends with an interesting climax which has come out really well and was well received by the audience. Then the film goes on to focus on the family sentiments of two kids which again has worked out well and viewers can feel the emotions of those parents."
"Drishyam is something you cannot deny. The movie says about a middle class man saving his family from the couch of police. Georgekutty, played by Mohanlal was really brilliant. He has once again showed that he is the legendary actor by his Georgekutty act. Jeethu Joseph has brilliantly scripted the film. Both Lal and Joseph were the main heroes of the film. The supporting cast were also good. Meena did a great comeback with the film. Asha sharath and Siddique were really supportive. The children, Esther and Ansiba are the great future of Malayalam industry and they proved it. Shajohn will be the unforgettable role in the film. He was one of the best villain ever seen. The climax of the film was superb, proving the movie as outstanding. So, the family thriller film by Jeethu Joseph is worth a thousand watch.....go for it!!!"
"Malayalam industry in 2013 gave some really good movies in Mumbai police, Memories but Drishyam easily grabs the top position in every aspect, let it be directing, acting or the script. First and foremost, hats off to the Director Jeethu and then to our Complete actor Lalettan who really has won millions of hearts through this movie. Extraordinary acting by Lalettan, brilliant character roles played by Shajon also equally good were Meena and Asha. No words to the scriptwriter for making this such a suspense thriller. Mohanlal with his outstanding acting skills grabs the attention of the viewers. Even though we hard core fans of Lalettan does not like to see him on the receiving side(I mean especially when he does not fight back), but it underlines the fact that the script is given more prominence than the great actor himself. Jeethu also deserves rich accolades for his excellent direction. All in all a must watch movie. Hats off to all the cast members!!"
"Venue : Grans Safeer Cinemas, Abu Dhabi Status : 90%And here we go. Finally got chance to watch the much appreciated movie of the year ""Drishyam"". I was literally dying to watch ever since I started to see overwhelming response from the people all around the world. Now ""Drishyam"" is completely a director's movie. Thank god for giving me a chance to watch it in theater. Years later when our next generation asks us about this movie we can proudly say, we were alive when it released and watched it on big screen. It was one of the finest cinematic experience for me in recent years. Really relished each and every moment of this seat edge thriller.As I said before ""Drishyam"" is completely a Director's movie. Jeethu Joseph indeed stole the show with some staggering efforts. He had tremendous control over the script and it never slipped away from his hands. Thank you for giving back the old endearing Lalettan. It was really a mesmerizing to see some enchanting naughty expressions on his face after a long time(Will get back to his performance later on). I have no other words to describe Jeethu's masterful effort. Awesome. Magical script and spot on direction is what the pivotal thing of this movie. You really nailed 2013 with two outstanding movies of the year. First half was just watchable for me but as the movie progressed i understood that, that was the only way they could build up this story. What can I say about climax. Damn!!!! Phenomenal by all means. full credits to jeethu. Bowing my heads down man!!! Coming to the cinematography GicKu JaCob PeTer Kudos mate!!!(Y) u and Ur Boss have done a fabulous job expecting more fantabaulous frames from u guys in future. Songs were pretty ordinary. In fact I could not give much attention to the songs since i was so eager to know what would happen in the climax. Casting was so unerring(Forget all the fuss happened regarding the casting). Editing was fine and dint feel any lag at any point of time. Lalettan looked so cool with his outfit.Now, Coming to the Big name of the movie ""Lalettan"". Uff!! what to say. Gotta see that vintage Lalettan on screen in many frames. Some naughty expressions really stole my heart. Thanku jeethu for giving lalettan this opportunity for his aristocratic return to the buzz world Meena was perfect as his better half. Arguably the best movie of this pair. Kids were so awesome. Ansiba Hassan did a fine performance. But ""Esther"" did overshadow Ansiba in many scenes. She definitely has a good future. Forget the lead role and everything, Oh yeah!! Kalabhavan shajon!!! ""MIND BLOWING"" effort from him. This could be the turning point for the actor in him. I seriously could smell the talent in him when I watched LnG. But this was totally an emphatic performance. Best of shajon till date. Hope he will get such omnipotent roles in the future as well. Asha Sarath. could live up to my expectations and she could come out of that disastrous ""Kumkumapoovu. Siddque dint have much to do still could evoke my emotions at times. Supporting crew did neat job and none gave us a boring experience.In short ""Drishyam"" is going to be the Reference point for those who worked behind and before the camera. ""Drishyam"" is for those people who missed ""MCT"" r Devadoodan"" kind of movies in theater. In the end I was really happy to see the crowd response everyone in the theater stood up and gave a big round of applause. The least we could give for this team. Expecting such supercilious quality movies from this team in future. Hope they wont disappoint us.Rating : nothing less than 10....."
"Jeethu's brilliance matches Mohanlal's excellence. The script is superb, with no loopholes and it is full on logic. The screenplay is also excellent. First half is joyful while the second half is a finely executed thriller which takes the audience to the edge of their seats. Mohanlal's acting is exceptional. The other crew members also excelled in their roles. Fine acting along with a brilliant script makes this movie a must watch one. The script like this can happen rarely, so make sure you don't miss it. The experience after watching this movie is unexplainable. The child artists were also brilliant. Too sum it all, this movie cannot be missed."
"Its been a long time since I have watched a Malayalam movie in a theater. But, Drishyam was an experience of a lifetime for me. Mohanlal and Jeethu Joseph provide a treat to all viewers and Drishyam seriously is the movie to beat this year. Mohanlal is just spellbinding and creates magic on screen. The excellent screenplay adds more value to the movie. The changes that an 'uninvited guest' makes in the simple life of an hard-working farmer and his family is the major plot of Drishyam. Asha Sharath and Siddique require credit for the roles they have depicted on screen. Also, Meena's return to Malayalam cinema and the roles played by young Ansiba and Esther deserve critical acclaim.The presence of some comical sexual references in the beginning of the movie brings the new-generation moviegoers into the foray. The way the plot builds creates excitement in the viewer's mind and keeps them on the edge of their seats. Kudos to the director for entrusting the role of a villain to the comedy actor Kalabhavan Shajohn, who does everything he can to make his role memorable. The short and sweet roles of other characters add to a wonderful storyline. In this new-generation era of Malayalam cinema, it is a relief to not to hear the ""beep"" sound during the entire movie. Jeethu Joseph leaves an ever-lasting impression on the viewers' minds and he is surely here to stay.Drishyam surely is (and will be) one of the greatest movies Mollywood has ever produced. Watch it in a theater and relish the chance of a lifetime."
"I have to start with saying that I am not a Malayalee, but a great fan of Malayalam cinema. Over the years, the time I spent on watching old and new Malayalam cinema was well worth the language barrier.Drishyam - once again only gives us the essence of the characters, like any well executed film, you don't see the stars behind them. The stars and actors are embedded and you move through the story feeling bit by bit. It is a bit difficult to say who is the right, and who is wrong in this movie, but it is not at all difficult to see who takes what stand, and the script has done well to have both sides represented well, albeit basing the audiences sympathies with the hero, even though he is concealing the truth against the law. Not the first movie of this type of course, but this whole transformation is made out quite well. I liked Mohanlal of course, as always he did a splendid job.. but in fact, the script and direction were good enough, that even if someone like Srinivasan acted in it, it would have been equally good. In fact in films like ""Oru Naal Varum"" you see a similar role (of escaping from law) played by Srinivasan to some extent. My full marks to the script and direction... Mohanlal, has played much more weighted roles in the past, but this at the right time proves his talent after a gap - and is a welcome in his career as well. Meena didn't disappoint, and so didn't the lady who played the IPS officer. overall, decent watch.. My bet to not go for a Telugu movie (my mother tongue) instead, paid off well. Now I am interested in seeing all other previous movies of this director."
"I can start my review of the movie by stating that i never thought i could see a movie like this in Malayalam....Surely This has taken Malayalam Cinema to a whole new level...Hats off to Jeethu Joseph for coming up with a subject of this magnitude and executing it to perfection.The whole cast was superb as if they were born to play this role and what can you say about Mohanlal this man is a ""Genius"", Just when you thought his best performances were past him he comes up with a Gem in the form of Georgekutty. Also a special mention for Shajon who played a negative character against his usual self and came out with flying colors....Well I hope this is just the beginning of a new era in Malayalam cinema and it continues to provide movies like ""Drishyam"" more often."
"Need to say, the movies like Drishyam make Malayalam movies stay far ahead of most other language movies simply because of the talent in place. Hats off to Jeethoo Joseph and Mohanlal (as expected) for such a movie, this would be one of the best movies of all time and trend setter for the movies in India. One of the best part of the movie is the justification of the characters by the director and the quality of support actors like Asha, Siddique and Shajon. I have watched Jeethoo Joseph first movie Detective and knew that this guy is going to be the best in the business and he is proving me right by every movie he makes. Even his last two movies Memories and My Boss were also pretty good. Well done Drishyam Team."
"Beautifully crafted movie. Hats of to the director and the entire crew. Its a movie which doesn't keep us on the edge of seat, but a step ahead. It draws us completely into the movie. Its been few days since I saw the movie, but the characters are still fresh in my mind and continuously make me thing of it. Critics may say that the plot justifies a crime. But trust me, you cannot justify a crime much better than how its done in this movie. And a legend actor justifying why he is a legend. Director Jeethu Joseph has raised his bar very high. Waiting for more movies in the class of Drishyam from him. Once again, hats off to the crew."
"Drishyam, a Jeethu Joseph film , is really a visually deceiving film. Mohanlal , the complete actor has just put the film above the altitudes of Malayalam Cinemas. The first half of the film may seem to be a bit dragging, but the take-off comes from the very beginning of the second half or even from the end of first half.The roles played by meena,The 2 daughters of the couple have just rocked the film. I am not going to break the suspense scene of the film as it is a must see scene.So,If you are a malayalee,you must see THE VISUALLY Deceiving DRSIHYAM and vote in IMDb....Abhishek MP"
"I never wrote a review for a movie before... but this time jithu made me to write my 2 hours experience for all movie lovers... hmmm how to start now !!! okey when this movie got released I was on my vacation to different places for 15 days so i was not much aware of what is happening in the movie field. Finally when i returned ""DRISHYAM"" a big new year surprise was waiting for me. First I got to hear it from my mother, then from my all friends and relatives. so we have booked a few night show tickets with a sky-limit expectations, since i was hearing the hails from everywhere and from everyone, As usual like an Indian somewhere in my mind i created a big curiosity towards the movie. Since it was a night show i though crowd will be less but again """"DRISHYAM"" proved me wrong there.. it was jam packed.Finally i was in front of screen and much awaited movie got kicked off... 1 gear, 2nd gear 3rd gear 4th gear till first half... then 2nd half 5th gear and immediately turned into a high speed jet then into a super sonic rocket reached till mars and finally a speedy safe landing... OMG !!!! in my words this movie is far far beyond from my imagination, expectations and thoughts. It has all the flavors of a perfect movie, nail biting twists, breath taking direction screenplay and awesome characters and super acting by all the actors. I should say this is one of the best movies ever i have watched in my life.Now I come to know why IMDb has kept Mr. Mohan Lal on 10th position among all the world actors... really he is a genius.Really a must watch family drama with your family members....Enjoy DRISHYAM.... reach me @ shyampanikar@gmail.com"
"I signed up an account in this portal only to make this post against ""KIRANAAR""Dear Kiran,I liked the way you reviewed the movie. But it might be a spoiler for those who not watch the movie. You have mentioned almost all the incidents which will give trill to the audience.Please let the viewers get the same thrill u had. Please remove the post as, it will be useful for those u didn't read.Also, please do not review a movie like this----------------------------------------------------As movie is concerned, the best thriller in Malayalam movie industry"
"'Drishyam', directed by Jeethu Joseph is a highly engaging thriller about a family of 4 and the incidents that garble their otherwise normal lives.Georgekutty(Mohanlal) is the owner-operator of a local TV Cable Service. He is stinginess personified (like his name would hint). The movie buff that he is, he knows the scenes and their dialogues from most movies like the back of his hand. He even goes to the extent of reviewing a car chase in a particular scene. This god-fearing innocent man is liked by all in his town (and the viewers are no different).Rani(Meena) plays Mohanlal's wife and like any other wife, she is full of complaints and demands about her husband's stinginess, late night work and what not.Things seem pretty much normal until one of their two daughters goes on a camp where she gets into a squabble with a rich brat. The boy pursues her to her hometown and with his video cam wrecks havoc only to get punished in the way he deserved. The rest of the plot is a cat and mouse game and the emotional settlement between two families who have been mutually pained.The plot that follows, acquires serpentine proportions and begins to crawl beneath your skin, dragging you more and more into the setting much like a shepherd would haul his sheep. This near perfect script has been dealt with utmost care to seal off all loopholes the human mind could ever conjure up, contrary to the nonchalant treatments that grace thrillers these days.With Mohanlal at his casual best and Meena at her wife-y best, this script earns an added impetus and is orbited into an altogether different height. Words of praise go to the perfectly cast Child actors, Asha Sharath and Siddique who all leave an everlasting impact on you. But no article on 'Drishyam' is complete without a mention to Kalabhavan Shajon who without doubt has broken all his stereotypical shackles and has come forward with a cracker of a performance. The nerve wrecking intensity that wraps the chemistry between Lal and Shajon in their combination scenes is an absolute delight to witness.Sujith Vasudev's soap-washed visuals of the greenery render the perfect native mood that is demanded by the script. Ayoob Khan trims this thriller to perfection delivering one of the finest closing sequences in recent times. With delightful background scores, everything about this movie is going in the right direction.The characters and visuals will remain etched in your mind even long after you leave the hall. 'Drishyam' is an insight into one of the unthinkable possibilities of a thriller that restores hope in this genre and dusts the scope for many a plot. A nail biting watch!"
