"The first time I saw this movie I had difficulty in understanding a lot of the dialogue not just because of the weird accent, but because the actors spoke so damn fast.  But despite this I became literally addicted to it. To begin with my wife got pretty annoyed because any other movie we rented would be ejected after about 20 minutes of viewing and in would go LS&2SB. Now she is hooked as well.I have lost count of the number of times I have seen LS&2SB and still cannot put my finger on why I find this movie so good to watch.  I suppose the most obvious feature of this movie is that it is beautifully balanced between being serious and humorous at the same time.  The characters are two-dimensional.  The villains are menacing, and yet they are made to look like idiots, and the good guys think they are so smart yet keep getting the rug pulled from under them.  They are all projected as 'cool' yet the situation is always out of their control.  Maybe it could be called a satire on true life.The style of this movie is unique, full stop.  I cannot think of any movie that can be compared to LS&2SB.  Quite a few people say that the style is a mix of 'Pulp Fiction', 'Goodfellas', 'Trainspotting' and 'Reservoir Dogs', but I think that you would make that kind of description only if you are really desperate to match LS&2SB to something.The best description I can think of is 'MTV does a crime comedy', and I honestly don't think there is anything wrong with that.  Like music videos, it is all non-stop movement and sound.  Something is always happening but unlike music videos, not without reason.The humor is incredibly sharp yet 'as a matter of fact'.  No one is really trying to be extraordinarily funny, but again it is the balance between being menacingly serious and funny that the humor really flies at you. I think that it is for this reason that a few people are really disappointed with LS&2SB.  If you are expecting a 'belly laugh Leslie Nielson, Jim Carrey, Steve Martin, typecasted' type all out comedy, or a serious 'Al Pacino, Andy Garcia, DeNiro typecasted crime thriller, you will find this movie a big let down.My favorite characters are Rory Breaker (Vas Blackwood) and Big Chris (Vinnie Jones) mainly because their two dimensional over-the-top characters are the most obvious.  Big Chris takes his son with him debt collecting, and while he beats up someone who owes chastises him for swearing in front of his son and Rory Breaker is the most idiotic drug-lord you could come up with.I haven't even mentioned the excellent and unique camerawork, speaker blowing soundtrack, beautifully threaded plot, perfect ending and the grittiest visuals I've seen.  You wont see any reflective glass laden sky scrapers here, or 'over head city shots', or incredible special effects. This movie has actors I have never heard of, dialogues that you have to rewind and replay to understand, buildings that look as though they have been condemned for demolition, cars that wouldn't even be seen in our scrap yards, has probably been made with a budget that most movies in Hollywood use for make-up alone, has no love scenes, or romance or complex relationships, no Oscar-worthy performances, and yet is perfect entertainment.Where our movies normally rely on budgets, this movie works on human talent alone.If any movie deserves a 10 out of 10, then this is it.'And there's one more thing...............it's been emotional'"
"Guy Ritchie's hip, highly stylized 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' is a truly remarkable film, not only for its appropriately pyrotechnic camera work, but also for its seemingly flawless, puzzle-perfect script/screenplay. While the picture's main focus is on a group of lads who invest money in a high-stakes, rigged card game and lose, the broader story concerns approximately eight different groups of criminals whose paths cross (more> than once, in some cases) during various illegal pursuits: money, guns, drugs, even revenge. The film is quite violent, both on and off screen, but it's also uniformly humorous throughout. It's important to note that the four central characters (a cook, a card sharp, and a couple of guys who sell ""discounted"" items) are interested only in acquiring the money to pay off their enormous debt; they kill no one. The same applies to the laid-back college boys who ""grow copious amounts of ganja"". The cast is comprised of mostly young, veteran, male actors. In fact, the only female in the film doesn't even speak, though she handles a machine gun fairly well. Sting appears briefly in several scenes as a bar-owning father figure. While his secondary performance is solid, as usual, it is also unmemorable. The soundtrack is first-rate, from the 60's hits of James Brown to the contemporary beats of London's underground. The groovy, pulsating music and lyrics are often succinctly synchronized with the action and dialogue in the film, creating a theatrical rhythm that is fairly uncommon in cinema (from any period). Critics and audiences over the years have often dismissed stylized camera work as pretentious and unnecessary, stating that it detracts from the story, bogs it down, or pads it; however, the film medium has the luxury of actually ""displaying"" a story for its audience, unlike the written word alone. It's what the medium is all about -- it's VISUAL. Hence, one of the reasons a filmmaker chooses such visual displays is to ""brand"" his or her work, in the same way as writers like Cummings, Hemingway or Joyce did with their medium. It's hard to imagine a cinema without Hitchcock, Kubrick, or Scorsese to represent it. To this end, Ritchie has taken his first step in establishing his own brand. His energetic, ultra-contemporary camera work incorporates (through a fresh perspective) such devices as slow motion, fast motion, and freeze-frame coupled with narration. It is at times reminiscent of (and actually expands upon) Martin Scorsese's patented visual stylistics and camera movements, like those found in 'Mean Streets' and 'Goodfellas'. But the similarities with Scorsese's work end there. Critics' endless comparisons of Ritchie's film with the works of Quentin Tarantino and Danny Boyle's 'Trainspotting' stand mostly unwarranted, as these comparisons take away from the inventiveness and originality of 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'. Ritchie's film is a much more involved, complex, layered work than the aforementioned comparisons. While Tarantino's films are very strong on dialogue, screenplay, and editing, they often lack creative camera work and direction. Boyle's 'Trainspotting' does have a resembling ""feel"" to 'LS&TSB', but aside from its Great Britain origins, there really is no need for comparison. 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' is essential viewing."
"I was a total and complete sucker for this film.If I were to write and direct a movie about gangsters or crime, this would be it.  I wouldn't change one damn thing.  Not a thing.  Everything in this film was, to my eye, perfect - casting, the camerawork, the excellent dialogue (""It's been emotional."")Now I don't have much to compare this to, and I've heard some criticism that it basically draws quite heavily from older British crime dramas.  I've got a bunch of these on my queue to rent, but I doubt you could make a crime film better than this.This film oozes with style, class, dark humor, plot twists and turns, and doesn't drag one bit.  The casting and characterization is perfect, and Ritchie isn't afraid to move the cameras around; no pretense is really made here at ""realism"" - Ritchie doesn't mask the fact that it's a film and he runs with it.I really don't think of myself as easily impressed, and I have seen a hell of a lot of films in my time, but this one instantly made my Top 10 after only a single viewing.  Yes, I'm raving about it, and while it may not be ""spiritually enriching"" or contain any deep sociological content (which I actually do look for in films), somehow it still scores as one hell of a film; memorable and entertaining, and stands up well to multiple viewings.I am a bit dismayed to see some of the marketing of this film comparing it to other things like Quentin Tarantino films or Trainspotting.  It really does it a disservice because this film really is its own phenomenon and stands on its own two feet; if anything it is similar to  Trainspotting and Tarantino films only because it actually has its own bold style.Can't recommend it enough."
"I'm not sure whether to call this a black comedy or a comedy-noir. The story is about four working class lads who have each managed to save up 25,000 pounds to spot their card-shark friend for a high-stakes poker game with ""Hatchet"" Harry, the local gangster.Unfortunately, Harry's game is rigged and the four end up owing Harry half a million pounds, with just one week to come up with the cash. What ensues is a set of schemes, counter-schemes, rip-offs, and bad/good luck that demand you pay attention. On several occasions I had to pause the video just to take stock of which gang was planning what.The final thirty minutes of the film, as the plots all collide and overlap, turn set-piece shoot outs into comedic punchlines.  The comedy is driven by exploding our expectations of what are otherwise pretty standard scenes from the film-noir genre.The acting is strong and the script very tight. Although I am not normally a fan of voice overs, this one informs without spoiling the action. And I liked the use of the slow-motion to disrupt the action and keep me paying attention.While this film may not be for everyone, if you enjoy a darker pallette, this may be right up your alley."
"Best comedy in years, friend turned me on to this hilarious comedy of errors and glad she did. The film is damn near flawless, forces you to pay attention to the twists and turns through it's witty dialogue. Wonderfully photographed with brilliant camerawork but not overdone. Worth several sittings and we could learn alot in Hollywood from this one...."
"Incredibly funny and entertaining story of four young ""criminals"" out for big money.  This is one of the most intelligently written stories I've ever seen.  If you like to write screenplays, let this one take you for a spin. Very fast paced film with great editing techniques and a hilarious cast and storyline thats sure to entertain, as long as you can handle the accents. Great cinematography as well.  This story will send you through a cork screw.  See it once, then see it again to see what you missed."
"LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS ( rating, * * * * out of 5 )Four lesser thieves from the East End of London find themselves dangerously in debt to a local smut peddler - the result of a fixed poker game. The consequence being that until they repay the money owed, each one will lose a finger for each day the payment is late.While trying to figure their desperate predicament, they overhear their gangster neighbors setting up a score from some slumberous marijuana dealers and decide that knocking over the neighbours is their only way out.After the triumphant thievery, they discover that the pot belongs to the same menacing individual they want to fence it through - a black psychopath whose history reads like the Anti-Christ's resume. Enter a miscellany of desperadoes and hoodlums who target our four lads.For the first time since 'Pulp Fiction', a movie comes along that breaks the shackles of tedious cloning. This film is entertaining and moves along at a cracking pace. Guy Ritchie's script is a tapestry of well-written characters, sharp dialogue that says what needs to be said and leaves the unsaid as food for thought, and a mesh of sub-plots that interlace together with imagination and expertise.His direction is crisp and inventive allowing the cast of eccentric characters to move about freely while maintaining that erratic edge. In this slick piece of film making, Guy Ritchie denies hackneyed Hollywood trends by scripting no true good-guys just varying degrees of bad ones.This is a terrific movie. It is violent but not extreme considering the subject matter and cast of cut-throat characters. The language is strong and the humor is black where you'll find yourself belly laughing at the brutal misfortune of others. If this makes you uncomfortable, then this film is not for you. It is also not for those who have been trained by television sit-coms to laugh on cue.Broadminds are required to enjoy this fine British film where it will definitely add some zing to your day. So stick your tongues firmly in your cheeks and hop on the thrill a minute ride that is 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'."
"You all may know the story at how Tom Cruise saw this movie at a screening in London, and afterwards said, ""This movie rocks.""  Whatever you may think of Mr. Cruise, I happen to agree after watching this film.  Although I had trouble following the story at times, it was a lot of fun, and Ritchie managed to juggle all the characters around and keep me interested and compelled to watch.  I also didn't have any trouble understanding what the characters were saying, and I think those who blind themselves to films like this by saying, ""Oh, I can't understand them"" lack patience.  I also liked all the actors, particularly, of course Lenny McLean and Vinnie Jones(one of my few complaints is I would have liked to see more of them in the film). And for a film which feels violent, there's surprisingly little actual violence, which is refreshing.  Overall, not a particularly deep film, but a lot of fun."
"If this film had been dubbed for American viewers, (even if it would have lost the magic of the cockney accent), not one person from the States would have said this wasn't a really good film. I didn't even understand most of the dialogues, but the weirdness of the characters and of what they did was really funny.  Not hysterically funny, but Funny! The mixture of comedy and violence was the thing that most amused me.  The story itself isn't of the most original, but surely efficacious. The photography and the soundtrack were also brilliant and to finish, I saw Pulp Fiction, I loved it, but after seeing LS&2SM I was too busy thinking over and over how much I liked it for noticing a whatsoever similarity with PF. 10 out of 10 is a bit too much but  9/10 definitely isn't! Watch it!"
"I have watched this film countless times and it is always funny, entertaining and visually appealing. It combines a great story (actually about 8 stories), lush cinematography (a personal must have), and superb dialog. When I first saw it, I thought it was a good rip-off of pulp fiction (a common theme on the message boards), but later you come to realize that this simply is not the case. IMO, it is much more like ""The Usual Suspects"", another great film.The visual appeal puts it in my top three list for this (along with The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, and Das Boot).There is no weak character - everyone is perfect and fits into place and has their own role in the whole story. But my personal favorite is Rory Breaker. He manages menacing and humorous at the same time in perfect combination.Favorite lines (from Rory Breaker) ""If you hold back anything, I'll kill ya. If you bend the truth or I think your bending the truth, I'll kill ya. If you forget anything I'll kill ya. In fact, you're gonna have to work very hard to stay alive, Nick. Now do you understand everything I've said? Because if you don't, I'll kill ya."""
"This is one seriously funny movie. I've probably seen it close to 10 times and it hasn't gotten old yet. Guy Ritchie brings us a hilarious look into the London criminal underground in one of his earliest features. The story revolves around four friends who become indebted to the local crime lord after a card game goes horribly wrong. The humor in this movie is sharp and fast-paced. At times, it becomes a little hard to keep up with the thick British accents and the cockney rhyming slang but overall, it doesn't detract from the movie. The movie keeps you guessing as to the outcome when the story becomes complex with multiple lies and double-crosses but the ending satisfies.This film marks the debuts of two of England's coolest new actors: Jason Statham (who went on to do 'Transporter', among other movies) and Vinnie Jones (now a familiar cinema tough guy). Jones is especially good as Big Chris, debt collector/family man. The majority of the cast aren't common faces in America (aside from Sting) but they all have the charisma to keep the audience interested. Another plus is the film's soundtrack, ranging from reggae to 70's soul. It adds to the movie's already laid-back feel.Everyone I've seen the movie with enjoys it (once they get past the thick accents, anyway) so I can say with confidence this is a fun movie. I recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy and I feel this movie's humor hits more often than it misses. I'd recommend giving this movie a chance at least once and I don't think you'd be disappointed."
"'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' is one of those films that I can watch x number of times and still enjoy it as much as I did in the first viewing. This is pretty much what an action gangster flick should be like. It has all the required ingredients. The action, humour, drama and suspense balance extremely well. Ritchie's writing and direction are excellent as not only does the film keep one at the edge of his/her seat but the characters (including minor ones) are rich. They're over-the-top but that only works for the film. While the bad guys think they're powerful and all, they're actually portrayed as dumb and the good guys think they're clever and have all the answers to their problems when they're actually not so bright. The characters are portrayed as cool yet they end up getting caught in a mess. The film too is somewhat satirical as it reflects a part of life e.g. the closeness between the four friends, the son following the father's (Big Chris's) footsteps. The humour is mostly dark with sharp, witty and funny dialogues and hilarious situations. It all seems a 'natural' part of the story. Shot in DV, the camera-work and use of music is very effective. The film has a raw and gritty look yet the execution of it makes it very stylish. Richie uses the same style in 'Snatch'. He should become an auteur and make more movies of this kind as it is clearly his fort (remember his disastrous attempt at romance with 'Swept Away'?). All the actors, whether it's Jason Flemyng, Dexter Fletcher, Nick Moran, Jason Statham or more recognized faces like Vinnie Jones and Sting, seem to naturally fit their parts. 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' is one of the coolest 'gangster' flicks. A must watch to those who love action films that have both substance and entertainment."
"Never seen a more entertaining gangster film than this one. It elicits belly-laughs with its black humor. Guy Ritchie lures us deep into an intricate world, a world only belonging to streetwise charmers, merciless debt collectors, dope drug dealers, paranoid marijuana growers, eccentric Afros and inept burglars. In this criminal subculture, they cheat and rob each other. Such a film as it is, if shot by a less intelligent, would be a disaster. But Guy makes the story full of twists and coincidences and weaves them all into his well-craft web. Elements like guns, knives, corpses and claret are indispensable parts for a gang film. In Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, guns are replaced by air rifles and antic shotguns, knives by kitchen ones and some kicking. And the bullets fly and corpses aren't that bloody since most are off-screen. And I couldn't help laughing at Soap's theory like "" guns for show, knives for pro"" especially when he soapboxes it with a seriousness on his soft-soap face. The dialog is recommendable and quotable. The shooting angles, especially close-ups cannot be more suitable for this films. See a label sticker under the sole of Harry? To crown them all, the cliffhanger ending is peerless."
"Bacon (Jason Statham), Eddy (Nick Moran), Tom (Jason Flemyng), and Soap (Dexter Fletcher) are lifelong friends. Eddy is the card player. Bacon, and Tom are hustlers. Soap is straight and legal. They pull together the money to go into Harry 'The Hatchet' big card game. Harry rigs the game and the guys are down £400,000. Harry gives them a week before his muscle Barry the Baptist takes care of them. They decide to rob their drug dealing neighbor. Meanwhile Barry is looking to steal a priceless antique shotgun but it ends up in the hands of the four friends.This is heavily influenced by Quentin Tarantino and that's not a bad thing. This is Guy Ritchie's full length feature debut. It shows that he has skills but it's not quite as polished as 'Reservoir Dogs'. The accents are quite thick. The comedy doesn't always translate well. However Ritchie has got the style down. This also introduced Jason Statham to the movie world."
"Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a funny film that gives new word to ""disorderly"".  About a group of low-lifes (Jason Flemying, Nick Moran, Dexter Flitcher) who have to pay a load of money to a mob boss who also runs a porn shop.  In this escapade, many funny (and crude) things happen, including a retreival of only 2 guns (and lots of money) and a father criminal and his tag-along son.  Clever British crime story from Guy Ritchie who makes his debut as director here.  A good time to watch, unless you don't like English people.  Sting appears in a few scenes as a bar owner (his role was my favorite).  A"
"I've avoided this movie for sometime now.  Firstly because friends told me that it was 'Pulp Fiction'-ish (and boy do I hate that movie). Secondly, because its British and although I'm from South East London myself and love British television comedies, I have rarely found British humour well translated onto the big screen.  Normally it is toned down to plain slap-stick goofy uncomplicated Inspector Cleuseau type humour tailored for American audiences.But to find not just British, but straight-faced East London cockney-slang and swear filled humour in a really stylish movie was a revelation.I have always believed that British humor, especially East London humor is much more sophisicated than American humour.  Maybe the reason why American audiences have been more forthcoming with LS&2SB is that despite the accent, they finally 'get it' without having to have it remade into an American version, ala Faulty Towers and Threes company and other British comedies. Yet, I believe Tom Cruise is remaking the movie with an American cast.  I suppose for those who just cannot understand English unless its spoken in an American accent.  That is really a shame as there are so many diverse accents all around the world and LS&2SB could not have been done in any accent other than cockney.Still, there are bits only the British will get, like the scene with the three guys pouncing on the traffic warden in the back of the van.  That scene had me clutching my sides.  Only someone living in London can feel true loathing for a traffic warden, the most hated person in Britain.Cinemtography was superb.  I wont go into who's already done the slow-mo's and stop action argument.  It is near impossible to do anything in a movie today that has not already been done.  You can either do nothing - or do whatever you can as long as it suits the mood and the flow of the movie, and Guy Ritchie just cannot be faulted.  He projects the seedy, thin laned, miserable weathered London, yet with such style that you want to see more. The camera work could not have been better.  Just see the projection of Eddy's unsteady, light-headed wooziness as he gets up from the gambling table having lost everything and owing even more.  Brilliant.The Soundtrack was as diverse and yet brilliant as I have ever heard in a movie.  I dont want to look like waving the Union Jack here, but this movie shows that the British have a more diverse taste in music.  From Reggae, to Ska, to Rock, to Mikis Theodorakis every track played just added to the scene showed.In short, LS&2SB is a movie that just does not stop for a second, is full of refreshing humour, filmed with style, has a lively soundtrack, some violence thrown in for good measure, and a story with more twists and turns than a bowlfull of spaghetti.Dont let this movie slip you by.  You'll either love it, or hate it.If this movie was not British, I'd give it an 8/10, but since it is, it gets 9/10 from me.Favourite dialogue: Rory Breaker: If you hold back anything, I'll kill ya. If you bend the truth or I think your bending the truth, I'll kill ya. If you forget anything I'll kill ya. In fact, you're gonna have to work very hard to stay alive, Nick. Now do you understand everything I've said? Because if you don't, I'll kill ya."
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels features a lot of local slang and Cockney accents and, while it is far from impossible to comprehend, you will be doing yourself a favour if you follow the dialogue in subtitles. In fact, even the unbearably annoying 'hard-of-hearing' option is welcomed. It follows a group of four very ""working class"" blokes as they try to help their friend Eddie (Nick Moran) get out of an enormous debt he amassed one night, playing high-roller with a local gang-boss that cheated. The lads resort to illegal ways to get the money, like ripping off their pot-selling next-door neighbours.This is a really excellent filmentertaining; funny, exciting, and extremely realistic. The style is gorgeous. In fact, I have nothing bad at all to say about it except that it may not be everyone's cup of tea. You also have to be patient with it. That may have been my problem the first time I saw it because I can remember mixing up quite a few people when not paying attention.. Still, the realism of the situations make up for its occasionally slow pace and dialogue-driven plot. For instance, none of these working-class guys know how to handle a gun when they need to, and the result is hilarious. They're not goofy by any means, but they're just normal guys that struggle with the life of crime that they are forced to turn to in order to repay Eddie's debt. Also note the fantastic use of ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"" by The Stooges. 8/10"
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is set in London where four close friends Eddie (Nick Moran), Bacon (Jason Statham), Tom (Jason Flemying) & Soap (Dezter Fletcher) all chip in £25,000 to make up the £100,000 entrance fee to a big high stakes poker game held by hard as nails villain & crime boss 'Hatchet' Harry Lonsdale (P.H. Moriarty). Eddie is an expert poker player & figures he can make each of them a clear £100,00 profit, if they play their cards right (ha!). Unfortunately 'Hatchet' Harry doesn't like losing & cheats, Eddie not only loses the £100,000 but actually ends up owing 'Hatchet' Harry £500,000 after borrowing it from him to continue in the game. 'Hatchet' Harry is not the sort of person you owe money to, Eddie & his friends must find a way to raise a half a million pounds in the next four days or start losing their fingers...This English production was written & directed by Guy Ritchie & has already deservedly reached pretty much classic status, in fact it still resides in the IMDb's top 250 films list over ten years since it was originally released & for me it throughly deserves to be there. It's just a wonderfully entertaining, witty, funny, clever British crime caper with bags of personality & at the time it was made originality although in the ten years since it was released many a British film has ripped it off trying to recreate it's success. There are a few things which make Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels so brilliant. First it's just so funny, I have seen Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels several times now & I laugh my head off every time, the really funny dialogue, the spot on performances, the hilarious one liners, the use of funny cockney rhyming slang & the things which happen along with the often bizarre situations the character's find themselves in means there isn't a scene that goes by where something funny doesn't happen or there isn't some instantly quotable insult or one liner. Secondly the character's are great, they have real depth & the good guy's are very likable so you root for them while the bad guy's are real nasty pieces of work so as a consequence you don't root for them, just the way it should be. Then there's the plot which at the time was fresh, new, original, clever, witty, full of great twists & turns & there's certainly plenty going on which rather improbably all come together at the end in a somewhat far fetched way but when a film is as entertaining, clever & downright funny as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels you just tend to go with it. A brilliantly funny British comedy crime caper, one of my favourite films ever & it's as simple & straight forward as that.Director Ritchie really injects some style, pace & energy into the film with various tricks which never become gimmicky or intrusive & only help tell a brilliantly story with style, originality & panache. Not only did Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels revolutionise the British crime caper genre with it's story telling but it has also influenced plenty of films since with it's slick editing & visual techniques. There's a fantastic soundtrack too, I really can't think of one bad thing to say about Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels which is pretty high praise in itself as I am not easily pleased. There's a fair amount of violence but nothing overly graphic & a lot of it is played for laughs as is the bad language & profanity of which there is a lot. In fact I don't there is a single scene which doesn't involve the use of strong language at some point.According to the IMDb Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels had a budget of about £960,000 which is simply amazing, a film this good & this stylish for less than a million? Shot on location in & around London Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels were the film debuts of both ex footballer Vinnie Jones & Jason Statham who have both done very well off the back of it. During the final credits the film is dedicated to ex bare knuckle fighter Lenny McClean who played Barry the Baptist & who died of cancer shortly before the film premiered. The acting is great from all involved, there's boyish charm to downright menacing criminal unpleasantness.Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a brilliantly funny, witty, clever & entertaining British crime caper that is a true genre great & one of my own personal favourite films ever. Ritchie followed Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels up with the equally brilliant British crime caper Snatch (2000) a couple of years later."
"For $8 million, this is a fricking monument of 1990's film.  The first time I saw it I laughed at most of the jokes and followed the plot with pleasure. That's more than I can say about any number of movies in the 1990's that cost ten times as much to make and starred pricey talent.  The editing is clever and cute.  The casting is just short of flawless.  Of the four principles, only Bacon seemed consistent to me.  The minor parts were sometimes spectacular, esp. Big & Little Chris and Barry the Baptist.There are some legitimate complaints about this movie.  The big one is that it doesn't really go anywhere or mean anything.  It seems like an awful lot of flash and talent to end up saying nothing about anything.  But um it's not like Lock, Stock is trying to be anything it isn't, so maybe it's not a valid critique after all.  Considering how long Tarrantino's influence has been around, it's a little unfair to call Ritchie on imitating him.  There are some similarities  large casts, distinct characters, clever dialogue, rapid shifts in narratives from one string to another and shifting in time, and few other things.  I think the problem is that years of dumbing down by Hollywood have almost eliminated all these things.  The influence is there certainly, but it would not seem as pronounced if there were any other hugely exposed filmmakers in recent memory that put as much emphasis on dialogue and character besides Tarantino.I haven't watched MTV since the mid-1980's, so the style of Lock Stock and Snatch didn't seem trite to me.  Some people I talked to said that the film style was too much like the average car commercial or pop video, which is getting the influence backwards, but I could see how those associations would spoil the experience."
"After being in love with ""Snatch"", my cousin and I began to look out for this film and finally we saw it on a bootleg of the imported DVD. That was about 3 or 4 years ago and the last year I saw for the very first time the Region 4 DVD so I get my own copy of the film and enjoyed for the second time. Last week I saw ""The Transporter"" and I decide to enjoy once again this magnificent work so I'm here writing, after a third view, my thoughts about Guy Ritchie's first feature film.The story introduce you this four friends: Eddie (Nick Moran), Tom (Jason Flemyng), Bacon (Jason Statham) and Soap (Dexter Fletcher). They have different ways to get money but finally they decide to enter in a big game. They put together £100,000 to play a card game, taking advantage of the great abilities of Eddie. But they are playing against ""Hatchet"" Harry (P.H. Moriarty) who is a porn king and now they owns him £500,000 and Harry is the kind of man that if you own him you better pay him. I really love how the story makes that you care and, at the same time, feel sorry for the four friends because they put in that card game all of their savings and now they need a real miracle to get the money in only one week. At the same time were are watching this, we also watch some other characters that, if you think first, doesn't have anything related with the four friends but you will see how little is the world. There are many secondary characters but basically there are just group of friends and partners: the drug growers, the criminal neighbors of Eddie, the two guys from the North and Big Chris (Vinnie Jones) with his son, Little Chris. And all know Harry and Rory (Vas Blackwood) that are the ""big bosses"". There are two more characters that are the ones that connect everything, specially the second one: Barry the Baptist (Lenny McLean) and Nick the Greek (Stephen Marcus). This story might look a little complicated with a lot of connected subplots but the way that is shown is just perfect, enjoyable and easy to follow. The style of Guy Ritchie is just so cool, for example the first sequence is just brilliant, and there are many funny situations just as many ironies in the entire story, being the one in the very end the biggest of all.Cast: Just brilliant. Eddie could be the main character and Nick Moran is just great. Jason Statham is great but he has a support role as part of the four friends so he doesn't stand out of the four because the four are a team and are great. As I watched first ""Snatch"" I found here many familiar faces like Vinnie Jones and Alan Ford. The last one has a very small role as the bartender but he is also the narrator with his unique voice. Also Sting appears as Eddie's father making a really good performance and ""the hardest man in Britain"", Lenny McLean, is terrific as Barry.Conclusion: Well for me this is nothing but a brilliant film. Great story, great characters, funny situations with a lot of irony. I mention in this comment many times the film ""Snatch"" and the only reason is because is a similar film, brilliant too so I highly recommend both. In this case ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" deserves a perfect and beautiful 10."
"I like this film a lot, but it is REEally not for everybody. Firstly, it will help non-English viewers if they watch a lot of BBC America, because the accents are a bit thick. There's even a scene in which a lot of Cockney rhyming slang is flying around which sometimes is broadcast with subtitles...and it needs them! Secondly, there's a fair amount of violence in ""Lock, Stock,""... and even though some is humorous, it's decidedly black humor. The scene toward the end where you might say ""everybody gets his"" could be used in a horror film, if it weren't for the ridiculous circumstances which brought the participants together. Guy Ritchie did a masterful job of relieving tension almost as it was being created, without spoiling either the tension or the laughs. The casting of this film is a fine example of getting a good portrayal of a tough guy by hiring a genuinely tough man to play him. Vinnie Jones, P.H. Moriarty, and the late, great Lenny McLean all had real hard-man credibility established before they started acting, and it brought a reality to their work which is hard to get. Sting's work in a small role is perfect, by the way; he should act more. To sum up: pour a Guinness and enjoy L,S, & 2 S.B. -- it is great."
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is about four London class act stiffs who put their money to a test in a card game until things end up horribly wrong as they owe half a million pounds within a week to come up with the cash. The movie is by all means, enjoyable. The characters are all likable and their sense of humour makes the movie tick up a notch. I found myself laughing a couple times in the film to the jokes. All the actors played their parts pretty well, but my favorite character of the film had to go to Big Chris as Vinnie Jones. He was the most entertaining and how he was always correcting his son if he ever made any mistakes was priceless. The dialogue was really well done by Guy Ritchie, as well as his directing. What I noticed about the movie, was how much it was alike to the 1992 film, Reservoir Dogs. Lock, Stock had colorful characters, robbery that ends up bad, unexpected tragedies, good screenplay as well as directing by one person, and a good sense of humour. All those resemble to Reservoir Dogs, it's not even funny. Overall, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a good and entertaining comedy/crime film that shows a good future to Guy Ritchie aka ""The Next Quentin Tarantino"", to many. Although it's not up to par with Reservoir Dogs, I still enjoyed it and will be paying a lot of attention to Guy Ritchie's films. I recommend it.Hedeen's Outlook: 8/10 *** B"
"For what this film was, I don't think it could have worked on the main criticism I have for it.  The fast paced nature of the film combined with the many different characters leads one to be confused as to who is mad at who and who has what.  However, I could follow it well enough to see absorb the skeleton of the plot and see Ritchie's creativity in storytelling.  This film begs for a second viewing, and I will probably give it that.  Highly entertaining and very creative.  Tough to get the accents sometime though. 8/10."
"This is a well-written, well-acted and beautifully shot gangster movie in which Vinnie Jones is as good as everyone says (though playing a menacing thug was not perhaps the greatest test of his acting abilities). However, like most of the other films which constitute the `renaissance' of British cinema (e.g. The Full Monty) this is a thoroughly enjoyable, but ultimately lightweight offering.The plot revolves around a number of caricatures; we have the ruthless gangland boss (into collecting expensive guns and beating people to death with dildos), the `soft' marijuana-growing public-school boys and a couple of thieving Scousers who would probably be more at home in a Harry Enfield sketch than in the East End, while the heroes are essentially the bunch of bumbling amateur criminals so beloved of the British psyche. Despite the inevitable comparisons to Reservoir Dogs et al, this is a very British film which in general rejects the slick wit of Tarantino to play on its caricatured characters with a mixture of understatement, sarcasm and dark cockney humour, with the occasional slice of slap-stick comedy thrown in for good measure. The plot twists and turns engagingly backed by an excellent soundtrack, and the ending is a relief from standard Hollywood predictability. However,  I was surprised to find that a lot of the much-touted violence was more comic than genuinely unnerving which was perhaps a shame  sustaining a more chilling atmosphere to contrast with the laughs would have contributed some depth to this film.Do go and see Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels- it is fun and well worth the entrance money. But it is as likely to change your perspective on life as Lethal Weapon 4."
"I didn't know what to expect when I popped this movie in my VCR.  On one hand, I had heard this movie is hilarious, fun, and three steps from Pulp Fiction.  On the other hand, it's British and it may not transfer into my American head very well.  I had heard also that the movie is a rip-off of Pulp.  Well, let me tell you what I think.When the movie was over I found myself on the floor laughing like a giddy schoolchild.  I was laughing for two reasons: 1) This movie is as funny as they say it is and 2) THE MOVIE IS SO GOOD!  I haven't been this giddy after a movie since, well, Pulp Fiction, which is why people compare the two I guess.  But don't let anyone convince you that Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a British remake of Pulp fiction, because anyone who says that is a fool.  The two are completely different.  Okay, maybe not completely different, but they're different enough.For one thing, Lock is no where near as serious as Pulp.  Don't get me wrong, Pulp had its funny moments, but Lock is 100% comedy.  The movie's laughs come from two places.  The first place is the funny dialog.  Once you get past their accents, which are a little on the thick side, you will find that these guys are just plain funny.  The second place is where most of the laughs come from: the plot.  The plot is so damn funny; I can't even begin to talk about it.  Watching these fine British lads get caught up in this mass confusion is good ol' fashion entertainment my friend.The only problem I have with this movie is that the director, Guy Richie, can get a little on the music-video-direction side.  With all the twisted camera angles and the pumped up music one could almost mistake this for a music video on TRL.  This really didn't bother me that much.  Just like in Pulp Fiction, these guys spent some time compiling the soundtrack.  Great soundtrack people!If you liked Pulp Fiction, you'll love Lock, Stock, etc. so pick this movie up.9/10"
"I will be honest, I turned on 'Lock, Stock' with very little hope - I had been led to believe that it was a senseless action movie, the type of film that FHM give 10/10, and the rest of the world wouldn't touch with a barge pole. I was pleasantly surprised upon viewing the film, but still could not see how people compare the film to the Pulp Fictions and Trainspottings of this world.Upon reading the comments on 'Snatch', which I am yet to see, I noticed someone saying that the performances on both films were excellent across the board. Not having seen 'Snatch' I am unable to judge that, but i can certainly say that I was disappointed with the acting in 'Lock, Stock'. I felt that while Vinnie Jones made a good debut, and there was the odd good performance, the main quartet certainly let the film down. At times the focus on reeling off snappy dialogue took precedence over actually acting, and to a certain extent this led me to stop actually caring about what happened to the characters. While the thrill of their audacious attempts was great, and some of the lines were hilarious, most viewers get too swept up to really care at all about the characters. Some will say that this doesn't matter, but it certainly does to me.Ritchie's style of direction at times baffled me - at times I saw glimpses of cinematic genius, and realised exactly what the 'music video style' could bring to film, (e.g. Eddie's departure from the poker game) but occasionally shots felt amateurish and lazy - for example look at the two Kennys' 'get the guns' argument near the end of the film. This meant i could occasionally see what the plaudits were on about, and occasionally jumped right back to my original feelings about the film.There is normally nothing that I hate more than pretentious film critics rubbishing a film because it isn't a) a postmodern satire on what it is really like to be a man or b) a documentary on Ukrainian house-husbands, and I did thoroughly enjoy Lock, Stock (I gave it 7/10). However, it is not, in my opinion, worthy of top 250 entry, and will always remain for me a post-pub fun fest."
"""Right! Let's sort the buyers from the spiers, the needy from the greedy and those who love me from the ones who don't"" Bacon (Jason Statham) and Eddie (Nick Moran) work a street crowd with their hot merchandise. Cops. They flee. When the film suddenly crashes into super-slomo, and a hard, street-savvy narration kicks in (Alan Ford's voice) telling us of Bacon's and Eddie's street chicanery on its last legs, we hark back to the opening of *Pulp Fiction* (where Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer are dialoguing intriguingly and cooing like lovebirds over coffee in a diner one minute and in the next, suddenly viciously holding up the joint). Like *Pulp*, this Guy Ritchie-penned and directed trash whore promises to be a dialog-luscious film with a rabid style all its own.It is.With a frenetic energy that few films today possess, *Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels* is the work of a film-maker who remembers that movies are, first and foremost, Entertainment. Guy Ritchie is Danny Boyle (*Trainspotting, 28 Days Later*) on crank.Along with Statham and Moran, Dexter Fletcher (as Soap) and Jason Flemyng (as ""Tubby"" Tommy) round out the quartet of twenty-something East End street friends who pool their cash to enter Eddie, a card-shark natural, into a life-or-death stakes card game with local gangster and porn king, ""Hatchet"" Harry Lonsdale (P.H. Moriarty).Which Eddie, through Harry's cheating, promptly loses.So begins Eddie and the boys' crooked quest to deliver ""half a million knickers"" to Harry before Harry's bulldog, Barry ""The Baptist"" (Lenny McLean) starts claiming their digits as vig.That's the short version. In the final telling, Lock, Stock - filmed with a leached look that makes London look even stinkier and gloomier than it actually is - is a Mobius strip of black comedic robbery and nihilistic bloodletting, shot through a revolving-door of criss-crossing, cross-killing, kill-switching plots.Concurrent with our desperate hero foursome (calling them anti-heroes does not even suffice for their level of ""anti,"" so let's drop the prefix and stop pretending we don't support bad guys), there are the dazed and confused marijuana farmers led by the willowy Winston (Steven Mackintosh), whom we first meet inanely arguing over locking the front gate; there are Eddie's neighbors, a gang of thieves as ruthless as they are inept, led by a chilling sadist, Dog (Frank Harper), whom we first meet as he swipes golf balls off the nose of a victim while machete-ing another hanging upside down; there is a black gang of giants led by a cockney midget with a fashion-challenged 'fro, Rory Breaker (Vas Blackwood), whose introduction to the story sees him setting a man on fire for insisting he change the pub television channel; then there are the two clueless, low-rent bandits (Jake Abraham and Victor McGuire) who burgle the smoking barrels of the title with plot-twisting consequences; there's Big Chris (Vinnie Jones), a merciless hit-man who is yet intent on raising his son with manners, and a hardened bar owner, JD, who shuns the maelstrom, not for want of street-cred, but because he is miles beyond mustered (played by Sting, as hard as the day he formed The Police).With a source-music soundtrack that swivels effortlessly between savage, scarring guitars to ska figures and traditional Jewish plucking, and slang so rich your ears will gain ten pounds (""not with Liberia's deficit in ya skyrocket,"" ""orders an Aristotle of the most ping pong tiddly in the nuclear sub""), Lock, Stock wends its complex way to a furiously satisfying climax, twists aplenty and a final shot that will renew your faith in creative storytelling like a date with a drunk Hans Christian Andersen.This movie is a modern classic.No matter the Serious Critics denigrating style over substance, this movie - stylistic to a fault  defiantly does not lack for substance. It is no secret that the nature of the medium is *reliant* on style, so it is as silly to say that a movie should lack ""style"" as a rock band should lack ""image""  these are the selling points of the products. Style is an integral aspect of a modern director's toolbox and Ritchie has consciously chosen to present his product this stylishly - and his cup overfloweth with substance too.Yet Ritchie's stylistic verve earns him his share of detractors, some rationally decrying the new breed of crash-cutting, shotgun storytellers, some just too slow-witted to keep up with the swagger of the Ritchies, Tarantinos and Boyles  subsequently, there are only two ways to take this movie: either not at all, or lock, stock and two smoking barrels(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)"
"Ah please, what is this ?!?! Writer/Director Guy Ritchie apparently likes Tarantino movies, and with ""Lock, Stock..."" he wanted to make his own cool movie, with a lot of cool plot twists. Unfortunately he fails to do so. And he fails miserably. There are so many twists and turns in this stupid movie that it just made me wanna stand up and shout, out of misery. I mean after seventy nine turns in the script it's really not that cool any more. And it also feels like Ritchie has put in these twists, just to have more plot twists than any other movie in the history of film making.This is truly a wanna be movie, because the entire thing is made out of parts of other movies, most notably of ""True Romance"". The cinematography is also really poor. There are a lot of annoyingly over exposed scenes, that just look cheap.I have friends who liked this movie. But I'm still shaking my head in disbelief over what I saw more than two months ago.UGH !!!!"
"Hollywood has no monopoly on crass, vulgar, tasteless, blood spewing depravity.This ghastly piece of British trash is as good (bad?) as anything the schlockmeisters of US cinema have ever done. The film runs 110 minutes. The F word is used 125 times. !!! There is not one character with one redeeming quality. Indeed, if I was a British criminal I would be offended. The story line is complicated enough --- you can't tell the bad guys from the good guys because there are no good guys --- but the thick east end London accents make the dialogue incomprehensible for the most part. There are two or three attempts at comedy. But none of them is funny. Cinema can be so downlifting!"
"This slick film details the lives of a bunch of blokes in the British underworld as they fight over drug money. The Cockney accents of most of the characters are so thick that anyone outside Britain would have to have the subtitles turned on to understand what is going on. There are too many characters and not a single one of them is likable. It's difficult to keep track of the three gangs, who all seem to have similar looking young men. The plot is interesting though somewhat convoluted. Ritchie directs with a lot of energy but his cinematic tricks (freeze-frames and voice-overs) are distracting. Songs are overused on the soundtrack."
"I really cant see why this film is so highly rated. In my eyes it's just a complete mess and Ritchies worst film. Compared to Snatch, this has nothing on it, not even close. The other critics on this website debate that Lock Stock has a better ending and story, but i didn't really see that. The pacing of Lock Stok is astonishingly slow and the characters feel like their cardboard cutouts without a soul. This also brings a negative thrall over this poorly directed and acted mess.I cant begin to tell you how much i disliked the cast, i mean awful. The choices of picking some actors like Jason Flemyng, Dexter Fletcher, Nick Moran and Steven Mackintosh is just like picking up anyone of the street and saying they will do. It's not on. And despite not having ever heard of any of them, i wish i hadn't now."
"This is the film that spawned all the shockingly bad British gangster films of 1999 and 2000 and this is no better than any of it's offspring.The basic premise of the film is far from original, a group of young criminals make a mess of a job and so on, blah blah blah.  The film is billed as being a crime comedy but I don't recall laughing once.  The characters are your typical cockneys, aside from the irritating accent, all you hear is various people being referred to as muppets, mugs and slags and then indulging in glorified violence.  Nothing wrong with violence, some of my favourite films are heavy on the bloodshed, including ""Goodfellas"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" but this is a dismal attempt to make it seem funny, when it really isn't.  Guy Ritchie, despite the reputation he is building for himself strikes me as being a director of a lot of style but very little substance and I don't care how many people tell me otherwise, VINNIE JONES CANNOT ACT.  The same could also be said for the rest of the performers in this appalling, yet well-received film.  Avoid at all costs."
"Ahhh... another witty British film.  Or is it?  The answer is plain and simple - NO.  It's a very sloppy, messy, Tarantino rip-off that tries to entertain us with pointless violence and not-so-funny dialog.  The acting is some of the worst ever and it seemed that they threw in the bad language at the last minute so try and steal some cheap laughs.  And cheap they are. So, if you want entertainment, avoid this like the plague and watch The Truman Show.  You won't regret it.  Trust me."
"Not only is this film vastly overrated, it's just plain bad. The story-line itself is tired. The manner in which the jokes are made for the viewer is along the lines of ""Pulp Fiction"". A lot of the humor in Tarantino's film has grown stale over time, but this movie is even worse. ""Pulp Fiction"" at least has some fresh lines, and the actor's are more believable as criminals. Guy Ritchie's effort seems as if he wants to become the European heir to Tarantino. He plays all too hard to try for the pop-culture youth demographic. This takes away from the film. All throughout it emits the feeling of a director looking for his Muse; but he can't find one so he ends up trying to imitate Scorsese and Tarantino - but convert them ""hip"" to young Anglo culture. The editing is wretched. When I first saw this film over in the British Isles I could tell it was directed by some young hot-shot who used to make music videos and was trying to hand at feature-length film - but using the same video techniques he employed in his previous works. It's choppy and stupid. If you want to see a film made with real insights of the crime underworld, which also contains genuine moments of laughter see ""GoodFellas"" or ""Mean Streets"". This movie is a waste, and in due time people will realize that it's pop-culture feel is paper-thin and no longer wears well."
"I didn't catch this at the cinema as I was somewhat put off by the hype and media circus surrounding it. So I was quite pleased to catch it on tv. My word, what a lot of fuss over nothing. Guy Ritchie certainly knows how to devise contrived and clever plots; the ending was a nice homage to 'The Italian Job'.However, that's where all the praise ends. After a bright start, the film eventually descended into a farce with people shouting at each in silly Cockney accents. Perhaps I've missed the punchline or lost my sense of humour but this film was like an adult version of Scooby Doo with its cartoon violence and characterization.Apart from some touches -ie the slow mo's during the card game - this film had a very made for tv feel about it. God help us if Ritchie is the future of British cinema."
"surely in the history of films there can never have been any greater collection of stereotypes in a single film. no opportunity has been missed to come up with characters such as 'Nick the Greek' and Hatchett Harry. In england we complained about what mel gibson chose to do in his awful awful films of braveheart and patriot but we seem to be quite happy to let someone british do the same thing. i suppose that i should feel grateful that noone from birmingham was in it, we would have been portrayed as having a broad accent and being thick no doubt.before anyone accuses me of having a humour bypass, yes i know that this is intentional. i know that they are cardboard cutout villains but that really is no excuse for having a cardboard cutout script. never before have i watched an entire film in which every line appeared to be written down before it was spoken. everything was delivered as though it was all some little in joke that we should all find funny. and i agree with one of the earlier reviewers, vinnie jones CANNOT act. he was in good company here however, since nobody in this film.it appears that this is no-more than a remake of the 'Italian Job' except without a few things, like the 60's style, noel coward, the script, the acting oh, but we were at least rewarded with not one person being michael caine, but at least 6 people trying to be him. only they all failed. badly.this really is the film that launched a thousand british gangster films, they have all been bad. but in that sense they have lived up to imitation being the most sincere form of flattery. for the british readers of this, to me this was like watching an extended episode of 'only fools and horses' with more guns and swearing. pitiful and grotesquely overhyped."
"This movie takes some time to really appreciate fully. First time you see it you like it, although you don't get the full plot and all the jokes. Second time watching you discover new things and start really enjoying it and consider it excellent. Third time you discover even more tweaks and turns and start loving it, from that moment you can see it over and over again and love it every time. I consider it one of the best movies ever madeA great story with a unique plot, hilarious characters and the typical British humor in every line Very similar to the other great movie, Snatch, where Brad Pitt is starring, although this movie is better. Vinnie Jones, not only a great tackler at the soccer field, excellent collector man in this movie. The other characters are also played very well, thrills laughs and unexpected situations, you do not have a dull moment during the entire movie."
"Before I saw LS&2SB, I didn't think much of British movies because they are really difficult to understand half of the time. LS&2SB was not much different in this regard. First time I saw it, I didn't understand half of the street lingo that was used for most of the movie but the action scenes made it worth watching a second time. Thank God I did -the copy I got was sub-titled in English and everything fell into place. I got my own copy and I've seen it over fifteen times since then. Could have been more if my buddy didn't borrow it and lose it. I'm picking up another copy ASAP. I give it a ten out of ten! Its an Ace among its genre."
"Frankly, I don't understand all the complaints about the accents in this film.  As an American, I had to really listen close to catch certain segments of the dialogue, but that was part of the charm of the characters. It may help to view the Cockney Rhyming Glossary on the DVD beforehand to get the gist of the slang ahead of time.This film has a bit of Tarantino in it but it isn't nearly as serious as Reservoir Dogs.  Although bloody, it isn't particularly gory.  It maintains a whimsical perspective throughout its length as the various parallel subplots throughout the film suddenly clash together in a satisfying climax.The characters are all quite entertaining as they seem to maintain a perfect balance of realism and cartoon-like qualities.Overall, an entertaining film, funny script, and a well-conceived story."
"Admittedly, I only saw this movie once, but what stuck me most about it was the disparity between the quality of the the performances and the overall lack of originality in the film itself. The characters go through the story with a lot of energy and natural charm (much like the characters in ""Go"") - I really enjoyed watching them perform. Outside of that, just about everything else in the film, from the quick cut  editing to the lead gangster's jherri - curl afro, is far too similar to ""Pulp Fiction"" to merit any praise. Tarantino's work is one of my favorite films of all time, but people have been going to his well way too often. LS&2SB does a better job at it than most, which is nice. However, I would have liked to see what would have happened if these superior actors were given more to do than channel the ""talkative criminal"" theme."
"Ready to give a chance to some ""modern"" movie figuring in the top 250, I valiantly endured more than one hour of plain stupidity spiced with boring systematic four-letter word spitted by so called actors playing a so called scenario.Sorry, but for me no interest, no goal, no suspense, no idea, no humor and absolutely no fun Half a century before ""Lock, stock ..."", British humor was Alec Guiness's ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"" But, if you like very looooooong video-clips, stereotyped characters with IQ about 20 and the kind of humor propagated by low-level TV, this is definitively THE movie for you. And apparently you'll belong to the usual sheepish majority"
"This film fits very well into a newly emerged, and stereo-typical, genre: the pop-inde-film. While originality is not the only criteria of importance, it certainly is one. To me this film seems a hybrid ripoff of Quentin Tarantino and Trainspotting. Ooh, junkies and violence (only without the aesthetics and purpose of the aforementioned). There are few redeeming values to this film at all. I really enjoyed (note the sarcasm) the slow motion and ""trippy"" camera work that were used at certain points. They were not the least bit necessary, as they did not reveal anything about the character or the scene. I suppose they were added to look ""cool"" and divert people's attention away from the nothing otherwise happening. Also, was there a single character who was developed in the least? I did not care what happened to any of them at all. 2/10 stars."
"I can understand why this movie was a hit in Britain.  They can actually make out the words that come out of these ultra-cockney-accented Brits' mouths.  As for us Americans, we're screwed.  Why this movie didn't come with subtitles is beyond my comprehension.  Despite that, this movie still became a hit worldwide.  However, I wasn't stimulated by its unique but often dry sense of style.  One thing I do have to note is the soundtrack, which is great, containing some head-bobbing hits by soul artists like James Brown.  To add to the incomprehensible dialogue, we're faced with an uninteresting and convoluted plot, full of twists and turns are supposedly worthy of an ""Ahhh"" out of us.  This is one of those movies that piles up so many plots and subplots to the point where I don't even care which direction the characters are headed.  I just can't wait for the movie to end!I think one reason why this movie has such a dull atmosphere is because it's driven by sit-down scenes.  Now, I read in a screenwriting book that ""sit-down"" scenes are like a kiss of death in writing a movie, and unless it's pulled off with pure genius like in ""My Dinner with Andre"" it will make the audience fall asleep in no time.  We have all these scenes where people are sitting in darkly lit pubs, when you know there's supposed some ACTION going on!  This is one of the few dialogue-driven action flicks I've seen. Of course, ""Pulp Fiction"" had a lot of dialogue scenes, but you know what the difference is?  ""PF's"" dialogue was interesting and funny!  This movie has certain echoes of ""Pulp Fiction"" but lacks the sly humor and intelligence.  I only laughed a couple of times--if this was, in fact, supposed to be a comedy.  And I watched it TWICE.  So for all of you out there who think I just need to give the movie another look--been there, done that.  ""Lock Stock"" is just not up to my taste.  I don't understand why it made the Top 250, but that's just me.  Message to Guy Ritchie:  Next time you make a movie like this...USE SOME FREAKIN' SUBTITLES!!!!My score:  3 (out of 10)"
"Eddy has been good with cards since he was a youth but more than that he is good at reading people. So he makes an agreement with friends Bacon, Tom and Soup to raise the cash to enter the £100k game organised by ""Hatchet"" Harry Lonsdale. Unknown to Eddy, Harry cheats and it isn't long before Eddy is in debt to Harry for losses of £500k. With a week to pay, the four friends are desperate but things look good when Eddy overhears of a weed den run by a handful of former public schoolboys who have lots of cash and lots of drugs. However as they try to get it, the web of gangsters and thieves just gets more and more convoluted.Although he has found out that it cannot produce a career. Guy Richie's debut film is a wonderfully fun piece of silliness and style. The success of this film can be seen in the vast number of inferior copies that came out in the years following Lock, Stock's release but although this is not a strong film, it is very energetic and fun. The script is a mix of characters all spouting exaggerated cockney dialogue in a plot that has plenty of twist and turns but very little depth. This isn't really a problem though because most viewers will come to this knowing what to expect  and few of them will be looking for a serious look at gangsters in London. No, this is nonsense but it is cool, funny and (if you ignore what came after) very fresh.For all his inability to work with serious stories, Ritchie knows how to use a camera and this film is full of visual tricks that work really well. Freeze-frames, slow-mo, different shots etc; yes they are all style without substance but the visual feel of the film is cool. The soundtrack is also really good and works well within the film, never hitting a bum note and always lifting the energy anytime any track plays. The plot is well written in regards the funny dialogue and the slick narrative but those who worry about films making violence and crime look cool should probably just avoid it because this is what it does in the place of substance or moral consideration. Of course this doesn't matter because Ritchie and the cast totally buy into the slick, violent comedy that they are making. Flemyng, Fletcher, Moran and Statham all do well in the lead roles  Statham being my favourite because he introduces the film with his cheeky sales pitch. The support cast are all fun even if some of them are unusual choices. Jones doesn't deserve the fame he got off this film but he is solid here even if his range is limited to say the least. Loads of familiar faces fill out the rest of the cast with good caricatures from Blackwood, McLean, Marcus, Flint and others.As we have seen, it has been difficult for Ritchie or anyone else to repeat the success of this film but for his debut he got it spot on. Although it lacks any sense of morals or character substance it is fresh, funny, violent and, most importantly, fun. Not to everyone's taste of course but cool, slick and enjoyable."
"A bunch of British lads combine their money and enter a high stakes, illegal card game with a vicious criminal. They lose and must pay all the money within a week...or they lose their fingers--one for every day missed.That's just the beginning of an invigorating, fast-moving thriller. Double and triple-crosses abound. The thick British accents are hard to understand at first but you get used to it. This movie is full of TONS of extreme bloody violence (how this got an R I'll never know); loud, abrasive music that actually fit the scenes perfectly; virtual non-stop swearing and a fantastic script--full of hysterical lines and situations and always moving. Also director Guy Ritchie never stops--his camera and is always moving and he shots every scene in inventive ways. Basically it's a movie that you can't take yours eyes off--the direction and the script are so great you're always entertained. All the actors fit their roles perfectly too.This isn't for everybody--many people will probably find this too violent and profane for them. But, if you're game, you're gonna have fun! A 10 all the way. It's easy to see why it's among IMDb's top 250 films.Only debit--you're EXHAUSTED by the time the movie is over!"
"Guy Ritchie has gone beyond mere Tarantino imitation and found his own unique voice in crime pictures, but unfortunately it's an irritating, witless, virulent voice. Sure, this movie is colorful and snazzy, but I think everyone gets snookered by the British accents and machine-gun delivery of the lines to realize that nobody says anything remotely intelligent. A lot of British humor is very good, but there's also a tendency to just have everyone be mean and nasty to each other and pretend that that's somehow the pinnacle of wit. Don't mistake flash for substance."
"Guy Ritchie is a genius. He turned a seemingly generic card-themed flick into something magnificent I don't even know where to start. Okay, so basically four guys, Nick, Tom, Bacon and Soap shell out their life savings so they can join a high-stakes card game with local mob boss Hatchet Harry. It turns out the game was rigged and the four of them ended up owing Harry half a million pounds and they have a week to come up with the money. Their ""genius"" plan to come up with the money draws the ire of some notable figures of London's underbelly like marijuana-dealer Rory Breaker, old school London thug Dog and debt collector Big Chris. The events that will follow is either a) funny, b) hilariously funny, c) wickedly entertaining or d) just pure black comedy genius.This film is just too darn good. Its a healthy mix of black comedy, style, flair, wickedness, dark humor and awesome, magnificent turn of events. The casting and characterization is perfect, and Ritchie isn't afraid to move the cameras around; no pretense is really made here at ""realism"" - Ritchie doesn't mask the fact that it's a film and he runs with it.The dialogs were perfect that is if you understand what the hell they're saying. At first if you don't understand the dialogs, just be patient because you'll get used to it.The last 30 minutes or so is probably the highest point of the film. All these colorful characters collide each with their own agendas and you will be laughing until the end. The closing frame of the film will either shock you or leave you in a cliff, hanging. The ending of the film is probably one of the greatest movie endings of all time with the accompaniment of that catchy song, this film is overall one heck of a treat. I had a blast watching it and I'm pretty sure it will stay with me forever.""Its been emotional"" - Classic. A must-see. 10"
"Gads what a great flick! This is a twisty, turny, shoot-em-up and laugh at the outcome type of flick. Brilliant in its pacing, plot, scripting and delivery. THIS is how comedies should be made.It has a plot that's so complex it's hard to explain, but they pull it off brilliantly. All comedies have a screwball plot, but not all of them can pull it off. Sometimes you're so fixated on the fact that ""this film makes no sense"" that you can't revel in the humor. With ""Lock, Stock"" that is NOT a problem at all. You can go with the flow, and can be amazed as all these diversely bizarre threads come together at the end.The movie also dives into that great comic well -- known as Lower Class Britain -- and delivers everything it can possible promise. Copious profanity. Indecipherable (for us Americans) Cockney slang. Seedy locales. Multicultularism that blends in famously. And stuff that only is funny out of a Brit's mouth (if an American delivered these lines it would be horrible).The timing and pacing of this movie are spot-on. Only very rarely are there bits that ""hang"", most of it is just one spot after another, bang bang bang bang. These folks really have comic timing down to an art form.Love the over-the-top hints of violence, too. In true Brit fashion they don't throw violence on the screen like Tarantino might. It's all there, though, and in great form. The ludicrousness of it is suggested, both in off-screen sounds and in the hilariously gruesome aftermath. Utterly brilliant in delivery! The filmmakers clearly had a plan and executed it to perfection. 10 out of 10, one of the funnest films I've seen in a while. Sure it's almost 8 years old, but it's worth renting it even now.Barky"
"""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" (1998) has become something of a cult classic (particularly in the UK) and has a devout fan following. In the wake of the Quentin Tarantino self-knowing genre imitators this is one of the few to stand apart from the rest and make a name for itself.Unfortunately that's all it really is -- a Tarantino imitator. It's entirely coincidental that it's had any more of an impact than, say, ""The Way of the Gun,"" or other failed Tarantino spawns.There have been some people on the IMDb message boards saying, ""...Tarantino just rips people off so how can this be a rip off of Tarantino?"" Tarantino does indeed rip off, or ""borrow,"" other filmmakers. But his visual style is a distinct one -- his raw, edgy, down-to-earth directorial style with the dark shades and grungy grain -- and ""Lock Stock"" copies this way too often.Guy Ritchie got his start in TV commercials and that's very clear. I suppose most Americans wouldn't be able to tell since the commercials in America are so stupid and banal. In the UK, commercials (particularly those such as the Stella Artois ads) tell stories and have a clear visual edge that is lacking in the US. Ritchie's style is identical to the sensuous and dark adverts being broadcast in the UK. The camera angles, styles and hand-cam shots are all straight from TV; the gambling sequence where a character's head is blurred and spun around, or when the camera bursts out of a cook's boiling pot of water, are straight from the tube; Ritchie's background is instantly recognizable. In my opinion, it's not a good style for film; it's like a mix between Soderbergh and Tarantino, and I don't like it much. (Although admittedly it's great for adverts.) This picture is alive, sure, because of the TV-style flair. But that doesn't mean it's any good. To be totally honest I found it to be a huge bore and a wannabe Tarantino flick crossed with Irvine Welsh.I couldn't care less about any of the characters. I liked Jason Statham the most, but the others are introduced so poorly, and examined so recklessly, that I quickly lost track of their traits and felt as if I was -- yet again -- watching some extended TV commercial: style over substance.The dialogue is OK, I guess, and in fact the actors all bring it alive because they do very much sound like Eastern Londoners. (Can't say how many people I've met who talk just like this!) That would be the highest praise I can give it.""Trainspotting"" is the best UK film of the 1990s, in my opinion, and ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" is a pale imitation of both this and the Quentin Tarantino generation. Its dialogue, directorial style and hip self-conscious vibe have all been over-used to such an extent that it just comes across as pretentious, showy and artificial -- not fun, just dumb."
"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels is one of those rare movies that flies under the radar until it gathers a cult following.This is Guy Ritchie's directorial debut. The story focuses around five groups of people, but mainly four friends who are now in deep trouble when Tom, a highly skilled card shark, loses in a card game that was rigged. They find themselves a quarter million dollars in debt and have only a week to get out of before ""Hachet"" Harry will start chopping their fingers off. The other story lines come into play when Tom and his three friends try to figure out a way to come up with the money.What I like about this film is the fresh script writing and odd humor. The opening sequence (Jason Statham street peddling with help from Jason Flemming) sets the right pace for a comedic and fast paced flick. From there we are introduced to every other character in their own unique way. My favorite characters have got to be Big Chris and Little Chris. Big Chris (played by Vinnie Jones) is the kind of character that was placed in the script to be the tough guy. Usually the tough guy is someone rather generic, but Guy Ritchie places Little Chris (Peter McNicholl) as Big Chris's young son to show a soft side to Big Chris. Big Chris tries to keep Little Chris from becoming a mindless thug by showing him how to do things properly without using foul language and such. The two characters become very comedic and do not become tired over the course of the movie.Another great element of this movie is the soundtrack. I actually got ticked off when one of the songs stopped playing when I wanted it to go on. Very stylish and the music seems to go right with every scene.Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels is highly enjoyable and won't disappoint you.8/10"
"""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" was the first major movie directed by Guy Ritchie.  It has many elements that it shares with ""Snatch"": a cool rock soundtrack, a complicated crime plot, colorful criminal characters, music video-style cinematography, and bloody violence played for laughs.  I enjoyed this movie of treacherous West Enders a lot.  The funniest scene was when Rory set the drunk on fire, and there were little subtitles to little sub-titles to translate the Cockney slang (although the whole movie could have done with sub-titles!).  Guy Ritchie has proven himself a kingpin in British movies, and leaves us waiting in anticipation to ""have a butcher's"" at his next feature."
"I've read some of the previous comments on this page and find some of them particularly unfair.  One being Americans not being able to understand or appreciate our accent - well its the accent that makes the jokes funny, also do we complain about a strong accent in american films? No! It would be nice for US people to look at cultures outside their own.  Also some have ridiculed the films editing and camera style. Well there is a way other than your bog-standard high concept mass appeal cash-ins.I saw Lock Stock way before Snatch and it was so good to see a decent British gangster film given the state the last few years had been.  It seems that most of the reviewers only saw the film recently and since then it has lost its freshness.  When I saw Snatch, although I very much liked it as a film in its own right, I thought it was just a poorer version of lock stock made with a higher budget.  Lock Stock, for a first film in particular is quick, snappy, gritty, funny and best of all none of this soppy sentimental crap that you get in so many of todays films."
"I want to know how Vera Day, the sexy blond of British films in the 1950's, who had not made a film since 1964, came to do such a wonderful cameo in this film. The moment she came on the screen, she was the epitome of the attractive, aging, hardboiled sports/pub owner, the kind where they stage boxing matches, and the kind of woman who knows how to keep her mouth shut.There was a pub on Eel Pie Island, in the east Thames - London's dockland, which was run by a woman who staged boxing matches in the pub. Tanya reminded me of her and brought back many, many memories.I loved the film, but Vera Day, as Tanya, is the character I remember most."
"After watching ""Lock Stock"" my first reaction was, mmmmm, not bad.  The more I thought about it however, the more I realised that it really IS bad.  It tried to be so many things at once - violent, funny, ultra-cool, unpredictable, cutting edge, etc. In my opinion, it generally missed the target.Yes, it did have moments of humour, but these were generally when glorifying violence, or through characters acting ""hard"".  It was certainly violent in places, had a few neat twists towards the end, but ultimately left you thinking that the director Guy Ritchie was just trying to be Britain's answer to Quentin Tarantino - well sorry Guy, you lack the characterisation and humour.  Remember Pulp Fiction?  We all laughed when John Travolta shot that guy in the face - to laugh in the face of shocking violence takes the work of a genius - Guy Ritchie has two goons being shot by an unseen airgun marksmen with the ultra-violent ""boss"" shouting ""will everyone stop getting shot"".  Yeah, hilarious.The acting was TERRIBLE.  Everyone sounded retarded - I've been to London, nobody speaks like that!  And that amber hue to the picture just did my head in. 3/10"
"""Lock, Stock..."" has some interesting scenes and good camerawork, and may be a great introduction to the British underclass.  However, it's difficult to understand, very profane, and unfortunately, derivative.  These types of hijinks have been filmed before (""The Italian Job"" and ""Get Carter"" respectively do the English caper and brutal crime things better), and they're never believable anyway.  The film will hold your attention, but isn't as amusing or clever as the average ""Monty Python"" episode.A ""6.""  Sensitive viewers should note that the film is very violent and profane."
"I missed this at the cinema, but heard many good things from my friends about this. I finally caught it on Sky last Saturday, and what an overrated film I saw. The film didn't contain a decent actor to take the lead, and comprised rejects from 'The Bill', sitcoms and Wimbledon F.C. The film didn't contain an original idea, and stole shamelessly from 'Reservoir Dogs', 'Trainspotting', 'Goodfellas', 'Only Fools & Horses' and 'The Italian Job'. The humour and stereotypes were like a bad episode of 'Minder'. It was shot in a grainy stock to compare with some of the British 70s classics. However this most certainly is not a 'Get Carter' or 'The Long Good Friday'. It was more a wet dream for FHM readers. All stylish clothes and no substance, and where was a female character?"
"What was the point of that? I'm going to go do my laundry.End of review. 0/10.Okay, I really wish I could end there, because that's all the credit Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels deserves. It's one of the few movies I've even seen that is so bad it's actually below me to sit here and write a negative review. I've watched a lot of overrated films, but I've never once gone as far as to call a single movie ""The Most Overrated Film of All Time"", simply because there are a lot of movies that could be called that. Naming one single movie ""The Most Overrated Film of All Time"" is just ludicrous. But I am seriously reconsidering my own line of logic right now and giving this film that title. That is how much I simply cannot understand the hype and mass love for this film. At all. It's like a movie that should be on the bottom 100 movies of all time, but then somehow, some way, it gets loved by the public. I simply can't comprehend it.Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a generic film noir piece set in a generic film noir world with generic film noir ""quirky"" characters and a generic film noir plot. Everything, every last thing, is copy/pasted from otherbettermovies. Critics trash movies all the time for even minor unoriginality, yet this has to be one of the most unoriginal movies of all time and it's critically acclaimed? It's impossible not to see the unabashed rip-off scenes from Pulp Fiction, most notably. Not to mention the Reservoir Dogs inspired scenes. By the middle of the movie I literally forgot which wannabe Quentin Tarantino movie I was watching, because I've seen so many of them they all just blur together because they're all basically the same movie. They all repeat the same variations of Pulp Fiction quotes. They all have the same basic drug-kill-money plot. They all think they're so genius because they have one sub-par plot twist that isn't even a plot twist because we expect it in movies like this.Look, I like film noir, too, but I don't love everything just because it's a stylish crime movie. It has to be different. Film noir started back in the 40s, and I think it says something when the only few films in the genre that become anything more than a small cult success are the ones that are truly genre-defining and added much-needed originality to the genre, not the ones that just tag around the bandwagon. In other words, I can see some people possibly finding Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels entertaining if you're a genre fan. But overrating it to the point that its at is simply stupid. It's generic. It's exactly like everything you've seen before. It's just a frozen McDonald's hamburger in the generic fast food storehouse. Get over it.If you're not a film noir fan, don't bother watching it at all. You'll fall asleep. If you are, and you're in a good mood, I suggest you try it. If the first five minutes bore you as much as they did me, just know that the rest of the movie doesn't get any better. The jokes are the same jokes you've heard in all the other genre pieces. There is nothing good that can be said about the acting. Some of it is borderline terrible. It isn't cool. The pansy camera cutting away from every single act violenceeven as tame a punch in the mouth!gets so annoying I wished more than once I could turn it off. It isn't cool.There isn't a single thing about this movie that is likable or entertaining unless you get it up by watching generic middle-aged men trying to be cool.I'm done.This film noir fan has officially given up on the entire genre. I'm done. Instead of ripping-off Pulp Fiction a hundred more times, why don't directors actually do what Pulp Fiction did? Bring originality to the tired genre.0/10"
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a film that is often at times fairly entertaining, and funny, but it seems to stop just there as a film that favors style over substance. This film is fairly basic fare as far as the plot goes for crime movies: four guys lose a bunch of money and have one week to get it back, and they decide to turn to thievery to obtain it.First off I will mention what I really liked about this film. First and foremost the cinematography steals the show, proving just how beautiful a film shot on 16 mm can look; as well the directing by Guy Ritchie is really well done, and he definitely gives the film a visual flare that is very reminiscent of a young Martin Scorsese; then the music is really great throughout, the whole soundtrack consisting of great British rock; on top of all that the acting is really well done through out. All of the stuff mentioned above really helps lend this film to a style that is both pleasing to the senses and often entertaining, and you might wonder where I found a problem with the film, and it is the story. The story seemed like a good, entertaining concept, but it never fully met its potential. The story just got bogged down by way too many characters and plot twists, there were just way too many. Now the screenplay had some truly terrific dialogue and some funny scenes written in, but majority of the comedy had nothing to do with the overall story. Then to cap all of that off, the film ran on for at least a good 15-20 minutes longer than it probably should have.Overall it is a film that is only worth watching for its well done style, but for no other real reason. Now if you love cinematography it is at least a definite rental, but if you don't, you should definitely skip it because you will most likely find the story too overstuffed to enjoy. It just seemed like it was trying too hard to be Pulp Fiction, but it failed.I give Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels a 4 out of 10!"
"Despite a decent plot and dialogue, this film did almost nothing for me with the exception of irritating me tremendously.  Of the cast, at least three were blatant Steve Buscemi mimics while another might as well have been a contestant in a Dennis Leary wannabe contest.  The characters seem to be overtly modeled, directly mind you, after characters from Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs.  Overall the movie seemed like a weak attempt at matching Tarentino's genius character development from those films. Not to mention the less obvious Kubrick rip off with their version of Nadsat (the dialect used in Clockwork Orange).  During one scene a bartender is telling a story using a dialect consisting of words meaning things other than their conventional definitions.  While this definitely has potential, as Kubrick demonstrated, the director chose to use subtitles for the bartender's dialect so the audience would be better able to understand him. It could have been better if a similar dialect was used throughout the movie and the audience was forced to learn the language in order to understand the dialogue. Aside from these irritating facets of the movie, it was generally good. The plot shifts were creative as was the overall cinematography.  I might have given it a 6 or 7 based on the plot, but because of the rip off characters and dialogue, I have to give it a 4.  It's worth seeing if you don't think you'll have similar grievances as I did, but if you watch a lot of movies, this will probably serve to annoy you as much as it did me."
"Think Guy Ritchie used all his good ideas at once in this film, and it still stinks. The whole movie is like a series of visual set pieces and bad dialogue linked together with an adequate but boring plot. I think the success of this film was that it's visual style appealed to wealthy teenagers from Surrey and Kent who like to think they are sharp dressed ""cockney geezers"" despite the fact they wouldn't dare go to East London for fear of being robbed.For me Michael Caine is one of the worst actors Britain has ever produced, so to be expected to sit through Nick Moran's terrible Caine impression is an insult to actors everywhere. The constant stream of poor retro cockney gangster films (Snatch, Rancid Aluminium etc...), and cheeky northern comedies about unemployment (Billy Elliot, Brassed Off, Full Monty) are taking British films to new lows."
I love this movie as it has no class. Gangsters in most movies are annoying idiots dressed up in pinstriped suits with flash cars or are Italian and eat and talk way too much. In lock stock you get four working class friends who need to acquire 500 grand in a week to avoid having their fingers chopped off and worse. Their next door neighbours rob drug dealers. What ensues is a barrage of double crossing cockney slang madness and most of the time takes the black comedy route. The original soundtrack is execellent composed by john murphy and the acting is funny and incredibly good. This film is a blast and is much better than it should have been considering it was made on the same budget that it would cost to create a few cgi explosions in a film like the matrix. Watch it
"I have watched this movie at least 2 dozen times, and every time I see it, it just keeps getting better!!! All the characters have depth, and you cant help but find Brit humor funny in this one! Jason Statham & Jason Flemying are top notch, hard to believe these two were just getting started in the industry! I recommend this to everyone that can appreciate a good laugh at Brit humor. From the poker game, to the robbery, to the shoot out that follows, everything was great. The best part is when girl appears our of practically thin air with the Brain gun in hand... you'll have to see it to know what I'm talking about. Second to that, the part about the traffic warden is another good running gag."
"Guy Ritchie made his mark on the world with the madcap ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", about organized crime in London's underbelly. I remember that when it came out was right after Columbine, so some people got irked by the violence, but I suggest that you ignore that and luxuriate in the pure hilarity. As great as the plot - maybe better - is the soundtrack. The song ""18 with a Bullet"" may have also reminded people of Columbine. But anyway, this is a movie that you're sure to like. Ritchie followed it up with the equally great ""Snatch."", but unfortunately followed that up with the dreadful ""Swept Away"" remake. But this one is a hoot."
"From start to finish this film keeps you gripped.  The acting is natural and the cast bonds from the off, every one involved deserves recognition, from the lead characters down to the extras.  Twist after twist keep you wandering what could go wrong next.  Violent, but mainly assumed, funny,neh hilarious, even Vinny had me in stitches and I don't mean the surgical type he is known for!"
"This is a dire film. There is swearing all the way through, and violence for violence sake. Not once does it add to the plot.There again, there is no plot - it is just awful... Do not watch it - there are no redeeming features at all......."
"After all the praise it had been given, I expected ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" to be at the very least, entertaining. I'm not too pleased to say that it failed miserably at achieving even that.    First off, the film is so overstyled I'm surprised that the cinematographer put his name on the credits. The acting is atrocious, particularly by Nick Moran and Val Blackwood. (Blackwood's over-acting is the only thing that made me laugh.) Vinnie Jones is decently cast, but is given the idiotic role of a hitman who carries around his 12 year old son to ""teach him the ropes.""     The script is a mixture of robbery cliches, and Guy Ritchie displays minimal talent as a writer/director. Jason Flemying has the only watchable performance in the film as Tom. The soundtrack is good, but here's a tip Guy, a good soundtrack doesn't make a good movie.  The film tries to overload itself with attitude but falls horribly flat. Was this supposed to be a comedy or a comedy of cinematic errors?"
I watched this film because it was recommended by a friend.I found it to be very overrated. The start of the film was so extremely slow that I wanted to just give up. Things do pick up near the end but the ending is extremely contrived.A disappointmenting waste of time.1/10
"This is a truly dreadful film. Every tired and overused cockney cliché is slotted firmly into place; the acting is terrible, the script is staggeringly lame and the plot is tedious; the cinematography is embarrassingly naff and the direction is wannabe ham-fisted fumbling; the characters are all two-dimensional cardboard cut-outs (Nick the Greek, fer Chrissakes - a five-year-old could be more original) and it was very hard to give a damn about any of them.It's been a long time since I've seen anything as this bad. I honestly can think of anything good to say about it. This is a truly dreadful film."
"Affected and boring - pretty much says it all. The characters and plot didn't seem plausible, and didn't grab me in any way - no empathy or interest in any of the characters, no humor, etc. Just people talking - no action.My teenage son liked it though."
"To say the least: I watched this film because of the high rating it got in the imdb. What did I get? A dull script, bad teenage-actors and stupid dialogues. And the violence they show isn´t as cool as they think. This is not the Pulp Fiction quality level! If you are over 16 years old: avoid it! It tells you nothing about cinema."
"Gangster films have never had the same pedigree in Britain that they have long enjoyed in America. Part of the reason is that the formative years of Hollywood in the twenties and early thirties coincided with the growth of organised crime fuelled by Prohibition, a period when the doings of Al Capone and his contemporaries provided a rich source of inspiration for film-makers. Another part of the reason is that during this period the British Board of Film Censors tended to discourage home- made gangster movies. This form of censorship owed little to moral concerns about violence- the BBFC were quite happy to allow cinemas to show American crime flicks- and a good deal to political considerations. British governments, of all political complexions, liked to play down any suggestion that the country had a serious organised crime problem. (And, by American standards, it didn't).There have been a few isolated British gangster films which have achieved classic status- ""Brighton Rock"", ""Get Carter"", ""The Long Good Friday""- but nothing on the scale of, say, the ""Godfather"" trilogy or ""Road to Perdition"". There have also been a few great British films noirs, but they often (as in, say, ""It Always Rains on Sunday"" or ""The Third Man"") featured criminals who operated as lone wolves rather than as part of a mob. ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" is another, more recent, British gangster film for which some have claimed classic status. The title is a play on the phrase ""lock, stock and barrel"", literally referring to three parts of a gun but having the colloquial meaning in British of ""everything"" or ""the whole lot"". There is also a reference to the use by criminals of double-barrelled shotguns as weapons, and to a plot by one of the characters in the film to acquire a pair of valuable antique guns.The plot is a complicated one, involving several interconnected sub- plots and several gangs of criminals. The main story involves Eddy, a young member of one of these gangs who loses £500,000 in a rigged poker game. Needing money urgently pay off his debts, he and his friends decide to rob another gang, who operate from the flat next door. This other gang, in turn, are planning to rob a gang of drug dealers. ""Hatchet"" Harry, the gangster to whom Eddy owes the money, is also the one with his eye on the antique guns, and engages Gary and Dean, a pair of Liverpudlian criminals, to steal them. (The two prove hopelessly incompetent; the film was obviously made from a London viewpoint and Guy Ritchie was using them to make a few digs at Northerners in general, and the people of Liverpool in particular. Gary and Dean habitually call all Southerners ""southern fairies"", even though those they insult in this way are generally far more ruthlessly efficient than they are). I have found it difficult to take Ritchie seriously as a director ever since I saw his ""Swept Away"", an appropriately titled vanity project which had the unintended consequence of sweeping away his then wife Madonna's acting career. (She has not dared to make another film since). ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" is certainly not as bad as that steaming pile of trash- very few films in cinematic history ever have been- but on the other hand I find myself unable to acclaim it as the classic which some people regard it as.There are several problems with the film. The first is that the storyline is over-complicated and difficult to follow- it is hard to keep track of who is in which gang, who is planning to rob whom, and how, when and why. The second is that the film never really decides what it wants to be. At times, particularly during the scenes involving Gary and Dean or the effeminate if murderous drug dealer Rory Breaker, it is so far over the top that it seems more like a black comedy than a serious crime drama. At other times, particularly during those scenes that end with a pile of corpses littering the floor, it seems very serious indeed. The third main problem is that there are no characters with whom the viewer can identify. Apart from a young child and a traffic warden who appears briefly, just about every character we see is either a criminal or an associate of criminals. And that's not ""criminal"" as in ""loveable rogue"". That's ""criminal"" as in ""homicidal thug"". We are invited to identify with Eddy and his friends, largely because they (unlike most of the other characters) never actually kill anybody, but as their activities include drug-dealing and robbery I found such identification difficult to accomplish.The film was rather better on the acting side; there is a very assured performance from Vinnie Jones, as Harry's debt collector Big Chris. The film marked the start of a new career as an actor for Jones, a former Wales international footballer, who has gone on to act in a number of movies and television programmes since. (It also saw the film debut of another international sportsman turned actor, the one-time diver Jason Statham). I also liked P. H. Moriarty as Harry and the late Lenny McLean as his enforcer Barry the Baptist, whose nickname refers not to his religious affiliation but to his habit of drowning people. Nevertheless, I found this a film which is just too blasé and insouciant about needless criminal violence. It leaves a nasty taste in the mouth. 4/10"
"It truly has been emotional. Favorite movie ever. It should also be taken in consideration that it was the first full length film Guy Ritchie made, the first movie Jason Statham and Vinnie Jones starred in, and still, I think it's the best movies for any of these guys.Snatch sort of keeps the same ambient, the same world, and though a very good movie as well, I don't think it matches this gem of cinematography. Guy Ritchie is the main reason why I'm trying to write movies myself and wish, some day, to come with a script even 10% as good as Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. It truly has been emotional.

This movie was not all bad but I just don't think it was as good as lets say Snatch or something. The actors all did a really good job and there was some exciting parts but the story line kind of just lost it for me.This movie is about 4 British working class stiffs who pool their money together to play a high stakes card game. However something goes wrong and all the sudden they are in debt half a million pounds and they only have one week to come up with the money.This movie was good it was just nothing special. It was kind of slow at parts and when the action finally did come I was disappointed with it. The later Guy Ritchie movies are definitely better in my opinion.
"After losing out big time in a rigged card game, and ending up owing half a million pound to a mobster. Eddie and his three friends have seven days to find the money to pay off the debt, or face the consequences.It seems a little crass to state the bleeding obvious, but Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels is the British blood brother to Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs. It's also that particular films equal and the best, and most successful, of the post Dogs imitations. Guy Ritchie's first full length picture has a knowing vitality about it, oddly seeming fresh even tho it harks back to crime movies back in yore. The plot plays out as an amalgamation of crooks and wide boy Londoners whizz around robbing and beating each other with care free abandon, all of course armed with cockney swagger to go with their respective weapons. On the surface it looks quite complex in structure, but Ritchie ties it all together with brio and a sheer belief that these characters are capable of winning over the audience. And they do. The violence in the piece is tough and at times wince inducing, but another laugh, or a beggars belief scene is just around the corner, and on it goes. Till the collage unfolds and the ending is nigh, and here Ritchie gives us the final nudge in the ribs to close the sale of the century. 9/10"
