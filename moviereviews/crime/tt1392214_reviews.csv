"Prisoners is a gritty, incredibly well-acted, suspenseful, thought-provoking crime drama thriller. The film mainly focus on the choices taken and the consequences faced by the characters when worst things happen to them.It simply raises the question: When your kid's life is at stake, how far are you willing to do to protect your family? It explores the likelihood of human behaviour when such crime is happening to us, blurring the lines between good and bad people.For a 153 minute movie, the story does unfolds at a slow and solemn pace (which hurts the film and might bore some audiences) but the dramatic scenes performed by the main cast members in the film will keep you engaged. Hugh Jackman and Jack Gyllenhaal both giving intense, Oscar-worthy performances here, defining and developing their characters with various layers of emotions: affection, anger, grief, empathy, guilt...throughout the film.The film's atmosphere, heavy rains, stormy days and icy cold winter managed to create a dark, dreadful environment to make up the dreary and haunting mood in the film. Every violent action taken by the characters are acts of desperation given that they are running out of time.However, the film is not perfect. Despite some plot problems from the various twists and turns shown in the film, the superb performances from the casts was sufficient enough to make the story succeed and believable.Highly recommended for those who wanted to watch a serious drama thriller with powerful, engaging acting performances from its talented casts.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2013/09/movie-review-prisoners.html"
"This was one intense movie-going experience. Throughout the entire running time of the movie, the suspense never lets up.The director masterfully weaves the haunting atmosphere, and I was at the edge of my seat. The plot is a wonderful puzzle, unraveling slowly to reveal hidden layers of depth and complexity. The acting was wonderful, emotional and nuanced, with some unforgettable moments (The two leads - Gyllenhaal and Jackman - give their career best performances, but the biggest achievement in my opinion is Paul Dano's). The musical score contributes to a sense of dread, as well as the rich sound design and the chilly color palette of the breathtaking cinematography.All those parts add up to a rare, gut-wrenching, dark and fascinating masterpiece - the kind that lingers with you long after the credits roll."
"If you think of someone being a prisoner, you automatically might think of someone behind bars. But apart from a physical prison, a prisoner can also be trapped mentally, either by his own doing or by someone else. This movie that starts off pretty light gets very heavy. And it is carried by its actors. Gyllenhalls characters might seem odd and out of place at the beginning, even like a cardboard cutout. But he does have more to do as the movie progresses.Still front row seat is Hugh Jackman. And while some might argue that a female should have a bigger role in this, you only have so much time to tell a story. And this is perfectly told and cut together. It might not fit your description of entertainment (and I don't think the filmmaker would love it described as such), but the movie is really great. If you like dramas in general you should be cherishing this .... and you will.We have a few grey areas that we visit and the ending did not satisfy everyone (I know from friends). But the movie could not have ended any other way (in my book). Superb movie one of the best released in 2013"
"There is a sensitivity that Director Denis Villenueve and writer Aaron Guzikowski inhabit in bringing their newest film ""Prisoners"" from Warner Bros. to the screen. Starring an Academy Award nominated cast that includes Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Terence Howard, Maria Bello, Viola Davis, Oscar-winner Melissa Leo, and Paul Dano, this is a smartly constructed and emotionally resound mystery thriller that is thoroughly enjoyable.The synopsis is fully in the trailer. When two young girls go missing, one belonging to Keller and Grace (Jackman and Bello), the other to Franklin and Nancy (Howard and Davis), a hot-shot detective (Gyllenhaal) is assigned to the case and relentlessly tries to find the clues that could lead to the whereabouts of the missing. When a mentally handicapped Alex Jones (Dano) is found near the scene of the disappearance with no hard evidence, Keller takes matters into his own hands.I have to say that I've never been this hypnotized with the works of Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. Jackman, who is fresh of his inaugural nomination for Tom Hooper's ""Les Miserables"" has capitalized in a massive way. Approaching his character with the ferocity that made him a star in the ""X-Men"" franchises, he hammers his way into every scene, keeping the audience guessing about their own moral complexities. He tears into scenes in a way we've never seen him and layers his character with plenty of affection, empathy, grief, and rage. It's his best dramatic endeavor he's ever done.When it comes to Jake Gyllenhaal, many, and probably for the right reasons, gravitate towards his work in Ang Lee's ""Brokeback Mountain"" as his shining moment in film history. I believe he's gone deeper in works like ""Jarhead"" and ""Zodiac"" but those were just the surface of what he can do as an actor. As Detective Loki, Gyllenhaal stands firm and tall in one of the year's finest performances. Terrifically executed as a man disconnected from real emotion, he finds himself enamored by the mystery surrounding two missing girls. He also orchestrates character beats and ticks that's reminiscent of Joaquin Phoenix's towering work in ""The Master"" last year.What is very refreshing in the film is it offers a great reminder of how brilliant an actor Terence Howard is. The Oscar-nominated actor seemed to fall by the wayside following his nomination for ""Hustle and Flow"" in 2006, coincidentally the same year Gyllenhaal snagged his first, and now has realized his capabilities when he chooses more dynamic and passionate characters. In a film that centers around his involvement, Paul Dano doesn't have too much to offer but is completely adequate in form.The film however is not entirely perfect. Aaron Guzikowski's depth screenplay offers a great mystery story, full of twists and turns, all the bit a tad predictable, but that's not where he falters so much. His construction of the female counterparts, Maria Bello, Viola Davis, and Melissa Leo, are not as crisply or smoothly put together as I'd like them to be. They each have one ""scene"" that gives us their character's motivation and the look into their cinematic psyche however, some are thrown in quite lazily and manages to halt the story in spots.The film's technical merits all rise to the abilities of its cast. Roger Deakins, the most overdue Cinematographer in the business, captures stunning portraits of conversations, weather, and scenes that continue to prove his brilliance in the film world. The film's score is masterfully placed by Jóhann Jóhannsson while Joel Cox and Gary Roach edit the film to an impeccable pace. At 153 minutes, the film is detailed, precise, and engaging nearly throughout. I feel there's a shorter cut of the film that would surely be a Best Picture nominee for this year's Academy Awards if it existed. The film could still garner that support with what they have now, but I think there are aspects of the film members won't be able to get around. A high level of violence and torture scenes infused with a longer run time could keep people at a distance. One thing that can't be denied is the towering works of Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. The two have offered plenty of memorable performances in their filmography, but their work in ""Prisoners"" is cut and clear their best they've offered.""Prisoners"" is a magnificent achievement for the film year. Thorough, enigmatic, and purely amazing. A must-see for the movie lovers.The film opens in theaters this Friday, September 20."
"Wow, what an intensely suspenseful film Prisoners was. The film commences with a naturalistic and peaceful look of a suburban neighborhood, leafless trees calmly swaying along with the cool air that encompass them. All is fine, and a perfectly normal family visits their friends/neighbors for a delightful dinner and some music. Everything is fine and dandy until both family's two kids run off to retrieve a toy they left outside. After pleasant conversation, the two families begin to realize that their kids haven't gotten back yet. The noiseless environment around them feels incredibly unusual, and once they realize that their kids have officially gone missing, chaos breaks loose. We are suddenly presented with a ruthless father (played by Hugh Jackman) who loves his daughter so much that he's willing to transcend any morally difficult obstacles to hopefully locate her. A spectacular cast, ranging from the likes of Hugh Jackman to Jake Gyllenhaal to Viola Davis and Terrence Howard, create such a chilling atmosphere that everyone in the audience immediately notices the discomforting subject matter as they prepare for a disturbing viewing. One should know prior to visiting the movie theater that this film doesn't feature morally perfect individuals. They are all human beings cast into an unbelievably frightening situation, and this is where larges amounts of debate will stir. There's one side of the audience that will persistently detest the characters' actions and the characters themselves, and there's the other side (which I am proudly a part of) that will essentially understand that people can't possibly (always) be the ""goody-two-shoes"" heroes, perceived in Hollywood blockbusters, in reality- that, by god, I will partake morally and ethically questionable activities to save a precious, loved one, absolutely! Such conversation/argument is healthy for it proves the memorability factor of the film itself. After you witness the terrifically-crafted picture, you will find enjoyment in discussing the movie's events with friends and family with- eventually- two sides forming over the talk. And holy crap is Hugh Jackman entirely convincing in his performance. You can see the longing to find his sweet, innocent daughter through his miserable eyes, filled with redness, desperation, and anger. Then, there's Jake Gyllenhaal as the second lead, playing an ambitious cop who holds a very impressive resume: no unsolved cases left under his plate. Can that mean his skill will greatly help in this predicament? On a similar note, Paul Dano takes the prize after Hugh Jackman for another wonderful performance. No offense or anything, but he completely fits into these immensely creepy and eerie roles. Speaking of, the soundtrack will definitely remain in that shocked mind of yours long after you've left the theater because it fills us with a sense of hopelessness and discomfort. At times, it sounds exceptionally ominous with the disconcerting sound of those violins in play. At others, it sounds like the music weeps for all those involved. The pace never seems to drag even though it clocks in at around 150 minutes as you remain at the edge of seat the entire time, utterly perplexed by everything that's transpiring and wholly befuddled by the choices that these people are making. The film will make you cringe and question the humanity of the participants or the competence of our law (that word could mean two things). Although I was slightly disappointed with the end result, the majority of the film strongly intrigued me. And, oh, how could I forget, the cinematography is simply amazing. Roger Deakins, the brilliant cinematographer behind last year's Skyfall, manages the camera-work of this film as well. As one wise critic said, a drive in the rain never felt so disquieting- a moment of foreboding. Furthermore, I would not recommend skipping out on Prisoners unless you're of the type that prefers more lighthearted and fun movies like The Avengers. If you love films that explore more than just entertainment and ""fun,"" such as important themes and moral ambiguity as a whole, you cannot go wrong with Prisoners. With a mix of top-notch cinematography, remarkably unsettling music, superb performances, and a thrilling/powerful story, Prisoners will definitely be one of this year's features that I'll surely be remembering. The true cinema season has started; now, let's hope every film from here on out delivers like this one did."
"Hugh Jackman takes you on a trip through the intense emotions a family is put through during its darkest hour. This may be his best role to date. From the trailers you know that his character will be out for blood as their daughter was kidnapped, but throughout the film you feel his pain, anger and moral struggles as he deals with this situation. The director does an excellent job of keeping you invested in the film emotionally even through some intensely violent scenes. Its dreary setting provides no comfort, but goes hand and hand with the narrative. This film may not be for those faint of heart but should be a must see for most viewers."
"Prisoners, the new film from Canadian director Denis Villeneuve (Polytechnique), is a top notch nail-biting crime-drama that is as good a theatre as modern Hollywood has the ability to produce. Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello play the parental figures of the Dover family. They are your average hard-working blue-collar family who begin their story by visiting neighbours Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) for a Thanksgiving dinner. The Franklins and the Dover's each have two children, the youngest of which (Anna and Joy) head out from their home on a November afternoon to play only to mysteriously disappear. Upon a frantic search, the Franklins and the Dover's suspect the worse. Especially when their elder children tell them of a mysterious camper that was parked just down the street. Police soon find the camper with Alex Jones (Paul Dano) behind the wheel. Alex has the mentality of a 10-year-old and tries fleeing when surrounded by authorities. But when Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) begins to interrogate Alex, he is less convinced that Alex was a part of the abduction. As days pass, Loki and Keller Doller work in opposite directions on the investigation. Keller is convinced that Alex Jones was a part of the abduction and kidnaps the frail and challenged Jones and tortures him for days in an attempt to extract answers. Meanwhile, Detective Loki follows leads that open up possibilities of a crime where multiple persons may be involved. And Oscar nominee Melissa Leo appears in a supporting but pivotal role that will assist in the closure.The trailer for Prisoners may have audiences hearkening back to Ron Howard's Ransom, but this is hardly the cookie-cutter kidnapping film that Mel Gibson lead back in 1996. Prisoners instead is an engulfing drama. One with a superb performance by lead Hugh Jackman that challenges how far someone would/should go in an effort to locate their stolen child. The script, from writer Aaron Guzikowski (Contrband) takes audiences down many different paths and emotional rides and Jackman's performance will have you rooting for his quest for answers even though his methods are unorthodox and highly illegal.The film is gritty and full of realistic characters and situations culminating in a perfect ending that goes 9/10ths of the way in giving its audience full closure. Not as much an edge-of-your seat thriller as it is a Zodiac type of crime drama where the stakes are the lives of two small children. Denis Villeneuve's last effort, Incendies, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 2011. Prisoners shows that he can move solidly into big star larger scaled films with the ease of a well worn slipper. And Prisoners catapults Villeneuve into not just a director to watch, but a director whose work should be awaited with palpable excitement.www.killerreviews.com"
"Prisoners movie reviewPrisoners is a Mystery/Thriller film starring Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Terrence Howard, and Paul Dano. Prisoners is a film about two families who both of their daughters get kidnapped and both of the families with the help of the police, investigate and look for their daughters. This is a very dark, grim, and at times is a hard film to sit through. That being said, I have created a PainOmeter scale out of five (five being the worst) to inform you guys if you simply cannot take very violent and painful scenes. This will be addressed along will the film's final score. I loved this film! Hugh Jackman plays Anna's father and is the protagonist of the film. You can see how Jackman really loses his rag and does a great job as Keller Dover. There is one scene that involves Jackman doing something that I won't spoil but you will notice it and go WOW! The story is also very thought provoking and will keep you on the edge of your seat because of the direction and character building involved with this movie. Also Paul Dano who plays Alex Jones, is this weird adult with the IQ of a ten year old and is the main suspect of the investigation. I thought he nailed just the right tone of the character and was hard to ""look at"" at times. My favorite part of the film was surprisingly Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as the detective looking for the missing girls. Gyllenhaal still plays the role of a cop very well after all of that training for End Of Watch. Another great part of the film is that it manages to never take a rest on character building and story development. I hate when films give you time to take a break then start all over again and this film really avoids that entirely. I really have no problems with the film except for the runtime. Even though this was a great movie I just couldn't go for a perfect grade of an A+. I will give Prisoners an A solid."
"I just came back from the theater and to be honest I went into this movie with very low expectation! But WOW did it prove me wrong. The film left me on the edge of my seat all the time, one could argue things were slow sometimes but it only adds to the beauty of the big picture.Performance are top notch and if it was for me I would give Jackman his very deserved Oscar for this amazing performance, of course all the other performances were really great also but Hugh's stands out for me.This movie is worth your time, and I'm sure by the end of it you'll keep talking about it with your friends, for me that is a success stamp if the movie can keep my mind busy all the time.This is not your feel-good movie. This is a perfectly paced thriller which I haven't seen anything like it in a very long time. For me this was a totally new experience as I usually go for lighter movies in the cinema, but after this movie I will go out of my comfort-zone in movies more often to find masterpieces like this one."
"Prisoners is extremely suspenseful and equally disturbing. Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, whose last film was the equally spellbinding and disturbing Incendies, builds up the tension from the first frame and does not let up for the full 153 minutes of the movie. Aaron Guzikowski's script, though on the surface a child kidnapping thriller, bucks all Hollywood trends and, as well as being a taut thriller, poses serious moral issues. It also helps that the film has a first rate cast doing outstanding work: Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, Terence Howard, Melissa Leo, Maria Bello and Viola Davis. Prisoners is not for the faint heated but is likely to feature strongly at next year's Oscars."
"Why You Might Like It: I can go on and on about the good things in this film and why most viewers will enjoy it. It has an outstanding cast that play their parts well, the directing and cinematography are gripping, and the story is something to marvel. This is an excellent film that I highly recommend.Why You Might Not Like It: I don't know why anyone wouldn't enjoy the movie. It does run over 2 hours, so some movie-goers might think that is a bit too long, but I don't think this movie will lose anyone's interest.Acting/Casting: 9.5* - As mentioned, the casting and acting is outstanding. Hugh Jackman gives the best performance of his career in my opinion. Paul Dano is downright creepy and plays his part to a tee. Jake Gyllenhaal, Terrence Howard, Maria Bello and the rest of the cast do great work as well.Directing/Cinematography/Technical: 8.5* - Let me just say that Denis Villeneuve has made his mark in the US after this one. The directing in this movie is gripping and pulls the viewer in from start to finish. I can't say enough about all of the small things that go into making the atmosphere in the movie amazing (the weather, the buildings, music, etc.) Plot/Characters: 8.5* - This is arguably one of the better abduction/kidnapping stories that I have seen. The plot is deep and has many layers that keep the viewer guessing all the way up until the very end. There is no doubt that the story plays a huge role in the final product that you see on the screen.Entertainment Value: 9* - It keeps you guessing throughout and on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Movies like this are why we go to the movies. Get out and see it.My Score: 9.5+8.5+8.5+9 = 35.5/4 = 8.875 Email your thoughts to filmwatchinfool@gmail.com"
"It's a great movie, sensational, effective thriller, blah, blah , blah. I don't want to repeat things that have already been said. I'll just say what annoys me. Most tension in this movie comes from it's characters being unable to speak. What's up with that?1.So we got this guy, who obviously has something to do with the kidnapping of the two girls, and as it turns out, he was the one who lured them into the van. It was a sloppy kidnapping, they immediately caught the suspect, but guess what,he can't (?)speak. They said that he is on a level of a ten year old, but he behaves as he is on a level of a three year old, but still, he has a driver license(?). So we then come to all the beating,torturing and all the screaming :'Tell me where are they?' If he said: it took them to my mothers house, the movie is over. So he was so resilient to torture or simply he was to stupid to make a sentence that makes sense. The later makes more sense, but on the other hand, it makes no sense at all.2.Then comes the priest who has a rotten corp in his basement. But he just mumbles. Like he's a 3 year old as well. He isn't able to say any useful information. Who's the dead guy, what's his name , how he came to him (or with whom, with what vehicle etc, etc..) He just can't speak intelligible. 3. Them comes the guy who steals kid's clothing, using pig's blood, hiding it with snakes. He's intelligent enough to recognize a cop, to escape him, to, at the first moment, when the cop shows at his home, fool him by saying '' I've never seen you before''. But when they need to interrogate him, he is suddenly like a 3 year old, drawing and mumbling and drooling like a completely retarded person who's unable to say one sentence that makes sense. So we still don't know anything and the movie goes on.4.Then comes the girl that escaped, she's in the hospital, but of course, she is not able to speak. Or else she would tell us where she was held, and the movie's over.5.And finally , when they rescue the second girl, she doesn't seem to speak as well. Or else she would tell them about hidden basement in the yard with entrance hidden under the old car. But no...So somewhere around 80 min into the movie , I had enough. I know that they wanted that exciting, disturbing thriller, exploring moral bipolarity of every human, dark (metaphorically and literally with all the rain and pale colors). But for me this was to much and last 30 minutes was like a torture."
"I had no expectations of this movie, as I was dragged along to see it by a mate with a Jake Gyllenhaal fixation, but was pleasantly surprised to find it was a bleak-seeming action/drama with Hugh Jackman too, who's generally excellent in everything he's in. The first 30 minutes or so of the movie were really promising. I liked the set-up of the 2 cozy families in their suburban idyll sharing a thanksgiving meal and discovering, to their horror, their kids had somehow gone missing. That part felt very real, very ""based on a true story"" and had me on the edge of my seat. As the film went on though, the clunky writing and flabby storytelling started to lose my interest.#1. My first big problem came with the utterly implausible discovery of the body in the pedophile priest's basement. First of all, Gyllenhaal's decision to move the freezer based on the flex being dangerously stretched, just seemed...dumb. Why would he care if the guy stretches his flex? It didn't seem from his reaction (""drunks!"") that he thought the freezer was hiding something, and yet he opts to shove the big heavy thing closer to the socket because presumably it bothers him. Then - whoa - there's a door there, and whoa it's a big cellar (which is not that weird really), and now - whoa - look a body!#2. And next came a great big WHY? He's a pedophile catholic priest so why was he SO outraged that a man might kill kids. He abuses children but is still so horrified by a killer that he opts to kill the guy who's (again...utterly improbably) has come to him for confession, but not so horrified that he tells ANYONE the guy's story? Or attempts to find out if it's true before he offs him? Instead he just stuffs the body in the basement and drinks a lot. Hmm.#3. My next problem was the biggest and clumsiest of the plot points. Gyllenhaal finds a body and hears a weird-ass tale about child murders (and presumably there's a not a lot of those locally), but despite his incredible intellect and ability to make connections, he doesn't spot the REALLY ODD MAZE NECKLACE on the body until the drawing falls conveniently from his desk alongside it, and make the connection between the two. #4. Why is escaped and presumably traumatized kidnap victim Bob stealing children's clothes, covering them in pig's blood and putting them in boxes full of snakes? It would make sense if he was somehow part of the cover-up, or working for Alex's aunt, but he's not. So for some reason known only to himself he's stealing clothes and making it seem like Anna and Joy are dead when they're not. Presumably because he's traumatized. Or just mental. But either way, it's not really explained, it's just a great big red herring that confuses everything.#5. What is the significance of Keller's dad's suicide? Because if there is no significance, why show Loki reading about it as if it's important? Presumably (again) it's so he can find out that the building that Keller's going to is where his dad died - but so what? Why is it important, other than to cloud the waters and confuse the audience even more. Was Keller connected to his father's suicide, why was no note found...all questions we have no need to ask.#6. WTF is this all maze rubbish? Right from the poster we're led to expect some kind of maze to appear. The serial killer wears a necklace with a maze on it, Alex says ""they're in the maze"", Bob is obsessed with drawing mazes, so where's the freaking maze man? When Holly gets Keller to back the car up we think ""FINALLY! HERE'S THE MAZE!!! But there's no maze down there, just a big deep hole full of old sneakers and dead snakes. No maze, not even a sniff of one. The only maze-related thing as it turns out, is a puzzle book that Leo forces the kids to do while they're kidnapped, presumably traumatizing them with their inability to solve simple puzzles. It might just as well have been Sudoku really, but that might have looked weird on a necklace...#7. And finally, the pointless sub-plot. Just WHAT is the purpose and meaning behind Keller's kidnap and torture of Alex? It has no real purpose other than to provide a weirdly amoral counterpoint to the other story (which would have been so much better emphasized if we'd seen anything of the girls' captivity), and leaves us confused and kind of weirdly angry with the guy. Alex is an innocent child and Keller has tortured him almost to death, so what does that make him? A villain? An anti-hero? A misguided vigilante? No-one seems to care if we know, so we end up drawing no conclusion at all and Keller ends up as a shapeless figure that we ultimately care little about.Ultimately my feeling was that this could have been a good film, if only someone with experience and a keen eye had been brought in to work on the script and iron out the many flaws. The cinematography and the score was great, and it's a testament to the director and actors that the movie was still highly watchable despite the glaring plot holes and confusing storytelling, but on the whole it was a disappointing and frustrating experience and not one I'd recommend."
"Just watched it. Acting great.But this is so badly written ---> 1 - HOW did the black girl escape! Her & her friend were drugged all the time? Oh, she just ""managed"" to get away -- she's in a locked room! Drugged! But she ""manages"" to get away . . . and another oh! her captor couldn't catch her! But the captor managed to get them the first time in broad daylight -- which is never explained! 2 - the captor knows one of her captives has escaped yet makes NO EFFORT to leave, clean up evidence, DO ANYTHING AT ALL, just stays there.3 - and when girl says in hospital ""you were there"" Hugh Jackman runs away to make him look like the suspect; he doesn't bother to tell anyone - like the cops - I KNOW WHERE SHE'S TALKING ABOUT! LET'S GO NOW, IT'S THE CRAZY AUNT!4 - why did the aunt not kill them after capture? Why do they need to stay alive? 5 - guy gets beaten & imprisoned in a cube of pain for a week, yet can't manage to articulate ""my aunt did it."" He was coherent enough to say ""They only cried when I left them"" to Hugh Jackman when Hugh Jackman grabs him by the throat in public; but he can't manage ""after my aunt took them away"" when Hugh Jackman beats him nearly to death? 6 - cop is angry, goes to his desk, throws things around, by CHANCE things fall on the floor & he sees a new CRUCIAL clue.It's a movie of bad red herrings, and coincidence. PS. Cop goes into a room of trunks and RUSHES to open one! It's full of SNAKES! Now if I opened up the first trunk in a room full of trunks and the first trunk was full of snakes, I don't think I would open all the other trunks, yet Cop wants to open more!"
"The most complex thing to think about the film Prisoners is why any of the Oscar nominated or recognisably 'serious' actors agreed to be in it in the first place. While it is clearly meant to be, judging by the blind critical reaction, a tense, thought provoking, violent and difficult film, I found it to be too dreary, too melodramatic, too obvious and, most importantly, too long.There are few films that can, successfully, keep me gripped for 2hrs35min. JFK is one and that other Gyllenhaal detective drama Zodiac is another but what they had, that Prisoners forgot, was a complex, gripping detective narrative with possibly many solutions and actual characters. It is in these two areas that Prisoners woefully falls short.Focussing, for the moment, on the little good in the film, Prisoners is very well shot by seasoned director of photography, Roger Deakins and not badly played by the starry, Oscar grabby cast, not that they're given a whole lot to work with.That being said, my first problem with the kidnapping plot is that it was obvious. If you, like my wife and I, indulge your silly brain cells every week by watching 45min detective procedurals like The Mentalist, Castle, Elementary, White Collar or whatever, then you will see the ending of the film coming a mile away. This is because, the way it was set up and as it continued to play out, there was only a handful of ways it could play out. Now, I'm sure, for those not so used to the simple twists and turns of evening TV, Prisoners may have been a gripping whodunit but, I am sorry, if you've read any, even mildly, detective orientated books or watched a Murder She Wrote then you'll know the plot, like I did, 45mins in and will have to sit there for another 1hr and 45mins waiting for surly, grumpy, tattooed Jake Gyllenhaal to work it out too. Which he eventually does but even his, supposedly brilliant, 'never lost a case' detective is beaten to the punch by 'very angry indeed' Hugh Jackman.Gyllenhaal's detective is supposed, I am guessing, to be a tortured, dogged genius but we never see any evidence of him really doing anything insightful or perceptive, he's not a fantastic puzzle solver, good with people particularly and there doesn't appear to be a great intellect pounding away inside his furrow browed, slicked back haired head. It struck me as one of those characters him and the director talked endlessly about but forgot to put any of the motivations into the actual script. We are told in dialogue he is brilliant and we are just meant to take it as read, despite the fact that all he does is mundane and routine investigation. Yes he has tattoos, a grumpy face and spends thanksgiving alone in Chinese restaurants but apart from that, we have no idea what makes him tick, oh and his superiors and the police around him are also woefully inept.Jackman is a survivalist, all American, possible religious nut who is also an alcoholic with an atrociously bad temper bubbling underneath a, not very interesting, surface. I was never sure if we were meant to side with him so that, we the audience, were complicit in his violent actions later on but seeing as I didn't really like him from the get go and seeing as I suspected that probably Paul Dano's massively red herring probably wasn't the bad guy (just by watching the trailer) that didn't really work for me. I actually found his reaction a little unrealistic and over the top but then I also found Paul Dano's character as annoyingly, idiotically stubborn as Jackman found him. Mind of a 10 year old or not, traumatised or not, I didn't buy for one second he'd stay silent for as long as he does, when he had no problem talking to Gyllenhaal's character for an apparent 10hr interrogation (we're told and see on video).Maria Bello, Viola Davis & Terrence Howard are all shockingly underused and irrelevant (mostly) and poor Melissa Leo is left playing, what slides very close to being, a comical old grandma part. Complete with bad clothes, huge glasses and a terrible wig. I am, personally, amazed that this film got made the way it did at all and, secondly, amazed that people love it so much. It's not that it's a bad film. It's fine. It just felt very obvious, mundane, grim and too long."
"Never written a review but Prisoners got my juices flowing – in a bad way.The film is way too long, a lot of unnecessary shots, no real emotion, no saving the cat moment (Blake Snyder) on Hugh Jackman's part and one of the most significant fatal flaws in my mind – absolutely no humour, not a pinch. It's a gritty film (and I get it), but please give me a break! An experienced writer would be able to lighten up the mood and that is a must from time to time.Now, the inconsistencies, silly red herrings and just plain stupidity: Why would the child killer go to confess to a priest when his faith dwindled after his son died and they waged war against God? The priest confirmed that the killer was ""bragging"" – so what is exactly the point of going to the priest? Does not sound like a confession issue to me. Fail Why didn't they get the priest to do a photofit and connect the dots that way? If you kill a man you sure remember at least something of him? Why didn't the maverick detective think about the old Auntie's husband going missing all those years ago and perhaps make some sort of connection? Nah, it's not good for the plot. Fail The same maverick detective-solved-all-the-cases finds everything out by chance – by chance he sees the cable sticking out from behind a cupboard which (surprise, surprise!) is hiding a secret entrance to a secret basement and the priest never even thought of getting rid of the body. Then, by chance again, the maverick detective shoves all the stuff on the floor from his desk and voila! – A clue again! Fail Why did Hugh Jackman's character need to beat the retarded Alex – when the genius detective interviewed him, it seemed the phobia of human touch did the job? Plus, Keller never got anything out of Alex although Alex's capable – when the plot requires – to utter a completely coherent and revealing sentence. Also, everybody would of course believe the retard but not the father trying to find his missing child. Where was surveillance? Oh, my next point – the whole police force consists of the genius detective, his superior with an office, a couple of administrative guys and a forensic team of 2 – get outta here! The genius detective does not only seem to have no training but lacking in common sense as well – why would you not close the first snake box and let the snakes get out whilst you're opening other boxes? This is just idiotic. Fail Everybody seem to be talking in riddles – the girl that escaped utters ""you were there"", everybody seem to hear it, see Keller run out like mad, but for the plot purposes, nobody reacts. Instead of questioning the girl (who, we've just witnessed, can actually speak!), they just stand around in a friendly circle. Fail Keller goes to the auntie's house knowing full well that she's a serial killer and (one in such extreme situation would gather) – very dangerous. He TURNS HIS BACK to her and mutters a threat. For what I know, she could have knocked him out with a frying pan at that point. Fail The evil Auntie, weirdly, seems to be repeating every command twice – open the drawer x 2, get in the car x 2, everything's repeated twice – are the writers short of words? What's going on? Fail Oh, and a note to the director – try cutting the scenes down or eliminate the ones with people just walking down the hospital corridors – may add urgency to the pace and people would not doze off whilst watching a 2.5 hour film the story of which does not warrant this length.The list goes on. Yawn... Enough now, otherwise I may write into the early hours of the morning."
"Spoilers ahead. Not that it matters.Oh my, what a waste of top talent and resources. This could have been a taut, effective, thoughtful little thriller, but the ridiculous plot holes and logical inconsistencies doom it (along with its unnecessary length). The Hugh Jackman character is such a glaring box-checking conceit that it diminishes any complexity I'm pretty sure we're MEANT to appreciate about him. Religious? Check. Hard-working common man? Check. Struggling in these dire economic times? Check. Adorable, loving family? Check. Tragic family event in past that molded his character? Check. Ironic plot development? Check. (The doomsday prepper gets burned; but wait, that whistle did come in handy, as we knew it would.) OK, let's stop there. I'm not saying the plight of the parents was not moving. Who is not moved by children in jeopardy, parents in misery? It's difficult to not see plots like this in terms of the basest exploitation. But it takes a sure and subtle hand to make it work, and that was obviously missing here. Many have compared it to Mystic River, which is apt, though that was a far finer film, and more believable as a police procedural. I imagine the screenwriter and director wanted us to take a hard look at what might happen when a good man goes bad for all the right reasons, but the lengths he goes to in torturing the Paul Dano character just don't make sense. Yes, maybe that's the point: Keller is beyond ""sense."" OK, but when the two other parents acquiesce to the torture (albeit somewhat reluctantly, but still), I wanted to throw something at the screen.While I'm still on ""character,"" Jake Gyllenhaal's detective is an absolute cipher. Maybe this was a decision NOT to give him a backstory of any kind because that would be lame. Fine. But in place of that we get a bad haircut, shirt-buttoned-all-the-way-but-no-tie look, some twitchy blinking, and not much else. I was rooting for him mostly because he wasn't actively torturing anyone.Other complaints:*One detective seems to be assigned to this very explosive case. Other than combing the fields for bodies, no one else seems involved in the ""investigation."" OK, this was probably a decision so the focus would be on Loki (his name,really?) and not on some partner chitchat, and at a 2 hr., 33 min. runtime, I should shut up about it, but it so goes against any police reality, that I couldn't forgive it. *Gyllenhaal makes a decision pretty early that the Paul Dano character is innocent, and so he is released - without surveillance and without police protection, even though Jackman's character has already attacked him. Yes, I know, some perfunctory BS scene with Gyllenhaal's superior was included to explain why there was no surveillance, but that also was stupid. He was their only real suspect. And a search of his aunt's property didn't reveal . . . drugs, syringes, handguns, sedated girls? Nobody looked into the history of this little ""farmily""? The aunt is taken at her word about everything. Oh wait . . . she had to be, or Hugh Jackman could not have kidnapped Paul Dano and we wouldn't have a movie.*The priest has a dead body in the basement. Obviously, he takes his vow about confessions more seriously than the commandment about murder. Oh, and that dead body turns out to be . . . Well, you know if you saw it.*The abandoned apartment where Dano is held is never searched (convenient new suspect emerges at critical juncture, too busy to send someone else over there to do a thorough search).*Red herring to end all red herrings: deranged young man with mazes, snakes, pig blood, buried mannequins, stolen children's clothing. *Just in general: too much crazy in too limited a geographical space (see Priest, Snake Boy, Crazy Aunt).*One child escapes . . . while heavily sedated? Crazy aunt nonetheless stays put, does not kill remaining child immediately. Why she was keeping them alive in the first place is not convincingly explained.*ONE person deciding that a dead child means warring with God and creating ""demons"" by abducting and killing other people's children is a just response to personal tragedy is far-fetched (not impossible, certainly), but TWO! Good times. Of course, the Man suffers a crisis of conscience apparently and confesses to the wrong priest. The Woman (female of the species and all that) has to keep muddling along, killing when she gets a chance. Times are tough (the recession applies to child abduction too). *The maze symbol is both too obvious (morally) and too opaque. Dead guy in basement wearing one, crazy crime re-enactor draws them, imprisoned Dano whispers it? Connection unclear.I wish I had that whistle at the end, so someone would have come and saved me from this movie."
"Prisoners is as close to perfect as a film can get. The cast add so much to this already intense and dark film, especially Hugh Jackman who gives an absolutely harrowing performance as a broken and deeply furious character. The musical score is slow and adds to how mesmerising the film is. It's hard to stop watching despite how dark, relentless and raw the story gets, due to the incredible directing, unpredictable characters and the mystery that keeps you guessing even if the answer is right in front of you. Despite being two and a half hours, nothing feels unnecessary, and the pacing never drags despite the length. An utterly perfect thriller with an incredibly compelling collection of broken characters and a mystery that will keep you on the edge of your seat right to its final, armrest gripping moments."
"After a disappointing summer of lame movies, the autumn looks more promising, with a bunch of great movies that haven't been as forced upon us. ""Prisoners"" is the best of them I've seen so far, and is in fact the best movie i've seen at the cinema in a while. Though that wouldn't be hard.With a promising cast, and controversial storyline, ""Prisoners"" looked great to me, and it is. The Plot is actually better than I expected. With great twists and turns throughout what is actually (as everyone says) a thought provoking story.Plus the cast do the best job possible in bringing it all to life. In Jake Gyllenhall, Terrence Howard and Paul Danos Case that won't be that much of a surprise. But the main draw of the movie is watching Hugh Jackman act his socks off as the grieving father. I always liked Hugh Jackman, so its great to see him actually act his a** off for a change and put away those shiny ""Wolverine"" claws of his for a while to make a proper dark and interesting thriller."
"The entire cast is absolutely brilliant in their respective roles. Casting was perfectly done. This is the most serious I've ever seen Hugh Jackman and he does it so incredibly well that I hade goosebumps more often than not. From the plot to the execution thereof was brilliantly done to bring us an unforgettable, thrilling masterpiece. Be warned, though, as the film is quite disturbing at times."
"Let's make a crime caper where we have an excuse to show a mentally disabled man get tortured beyond reason. Even if he might be the suspect we are subjected to the overzealous rage filled attacks carried out by the kidnapped child's father. Let's also throw in some religious rhetoric to situate villainy in Christians , elderly widows, depraved sickos and handicapped people.Why were all of these vile charges crammed in just one movie? It leaves me to respond with affirmation that this movie intended to anger, upset and disgust any unsuspecting movie goer. But along with making a crime caper that involves a kidnapping, we are also given a slow moving plot filled with misleading clues, uneven continuity, numerous twists and red-herrings that don't make much sense. Many questions will be asked as you labor through this torturous drama and it only gets more aggravating and confusing. Why would a police department be so incompetent as to have the parents be committing vigilantism without any surveillance? This is highly unlikely in America, even in rural Midwestern towns. Did the writers bother to consult Law authorities on investigative and forensic procedures? Because they seem non-existent in this unbelievable tale.The most unforgiving and unsympathetic performance is Hugh Jackman's character who completely absconds any sense of responsibility and regard for law, humanity and common sense. As we see him emerging into madness and sadistic rage we quickly lose any empathy for him. How is it that any person can enjoy or be fascinated with the brutal torture of a feeble and mentally incapable simpleton? It's just an exercise in ugliness and perpetuates into the extreme. It was overdone. It would have been more believable if the torture was attempted and later foregone, realizing the method of debriefing wasn't working. Jackman's acting is way over the top and fails to draw any sympathy. Perhaps it was bad acting or a faulty script. It's as if the director was pushing him in a weekly actor's workshop to go the limit with unconstrained rage. It doesn't work.I also was annoyed at Gyllenhall's sleepy performance. For a detective who is supposed to have a stellar record, he sure missed much of the insanity going on with the people involved. This movie is also anti-authority and rebellious in its stance. Showing cops get maligned and disrespected is commonplace as the parents just freely go about their neurotic business of vigilantism.Many times I asked myself, 'Why is this happening? What did that mean? How is this guy involved? How did this old lady ever orchestrate such a kidnapping spree without getting caught? She seems a wee bit too old and frail to be carrying out such a demonic feat with grown men. Why did the other suspect break into the house while the mother was there? What exactly was he after? Why would he show up at a Candlelight vigil and make a spectacle of himself? Lame and stupid plot making. Why wasn't the priest ever a suspect before the kidnapping? You would think the police would be led to clues as to the dead man's whereabouts. Why would the old lady wait for Dover's second visit to constrain him? Was she so certain her demonic plan could rebound after losing one hostage? Most reprehensible is this movie's conviction of wallowing in its own depravity. It fails to make a distinction between what we can assert as truthful and moral behavior and what is incomprehensible behavior. This cheesy tag-line, ""How far would you go?"" only ushers in a weak excuse for someone to go ballistic on anyone they suspect. Even if the person in question has the wrong look in his eye. The question is so bad that it doesn't even deserve to be dignified with an intelligent answer. The question that should be asked is ""How much effort does a caring father need to put forth in order to assure the safety of his family, himself and his daughter?"" By committing abduction and torture he puts himself in jeopardy and his family.I could go on with more questions, but Prisoners doesn't have any redeeming qualities. A plethora of weird clues such as snakes stuffed in crates, the numerous scenes featuring a maze, weird wall paper, bloody clothes add up to nothing in this labyrinth of trash. It's all shock material that is poorly crafted and handled. And it isn't even believable."
"I sometimes wonder if I live on the same planet as critics on IMDb. This is easily the very worst movie of the year and one of the ten worst of all time. Poorly written way way way way too long and so filled with lies clichés and stupidity it boggles the mind. I admit as a lawyer I am biased against these kind of movies where suspects are tortured beaten senseless and arrested with zero probable cause. That Jackman would make this movie after his magnificent performance in Lez Miz could only have been for the money. His role is a one-dimensional idiot without intelligence who gets it wrong from the beginning. Jake G has the worst role as stupid numbskull cop who hasn't a clue as to what is going on. I didn't give a fig about the parents, or their kids. There was zero background on what kin of parents and kids they were. This was not even a bad TV movie, it was a waste of time. Its length is inexcusable, its plot beyond idiotic and its actors were like very bad run of the mill nobodies. They all should be ashamed of themselves--the writer, director actors and everyone else. Don't see this film. Boycott it, and if not tell your friends to forget it, God it was awful!!"
"Whenever you can set aside a few hours for this thing, go and see it. Just be prepared for it: this ain't a movie you can just casually watch."
"Denis Villeneuve didn't debut with Prisoners, but it was this movie that put him on the map as one of the most exciting new talents to come around in sometime. Prisoners is about a pair of girls who are abducted which leads to an investigation and search effort by the father of one girl played superbly by Hugh Jackman. This is a tough but rewarding film to sit through and the pacing is good- you will be transfixed throughout. The acting is superb and everyone from Terence Howard and Jake Gyllenhaal to Paul Dano and Melissa Holly shine, but the star act is Jackman who should have received more accolades for his turn as the distraught father in this movie. Cinematography is stunning as is the direction."
"There's basically 2 types of movies: In the 1st type you create a world that is so fictional and different from ours, that the viewer knows to turn off his challenging and logical mind and just go with it. Superman, Avatar, etc.The 2nd type is set in the real world. Sure it's fiction and I understand that to make this type of movie interesting you have to compound coincidences that wouldn't likely all happen in real life. This type of movie, however doesn't get a free pass on the impossible, just on unlikely.So here we have a modern setting in suburban small town New York state where 2 girls go missing. So the entertainment value here is watching how people interact and cope with the situation. Here's a few of the things that's hopelessly unreal: Cops don't go to possible dangerous places alone. Instead they call the SWAT team, or call for backup or at least have a partner.Alex Jones, the kidnapped suspect can do a 10 hour interview with Detective Loki, but can endure days of torture before he says anything to Keller Dover, the crazy father torturer. Doesn't make sense since he's hot the bad guy.Franklin and Nancy Birch, totally unbelievable. Franklin is led to the torture chamber and voices his disbelief several times before joining in. Franklin tells his wife who doesn't call the cops, no she goes to the torture chamber, tells the other 2 how bad they are and they co-operates with them.Bob Taylor, another traumatized grown up child victim, acts normal, holds down a job, but collects clothes from current victims, puts blood on them and stores them in locked boxes full of snakes on his property.So all we have is a story that is not just improbable, but impossible, scene after scene. Much more believable is Obi Wan Ken-obi getting a free pass by wiggling his fingers and saying, ""these aren't the Droids you're looking for."" That was entertaining. What's entertaining about an impossible fantasy of something so real and horrible as child abduction?"
"I really didn't like this movie. Not because of the gore, not because of the language, but because of the pacing, the acting and most definitely the ending. The movie went on for two hours and they left it hanging at a really stupid time - if you're going to purposely leave the ending hanging, leave it at a time point where it's a bit ambiguous and up to the viewer how it ends. But they left it hanging at a point where it's pretty obvious what's going to happen next, but denying the viewers the chance to see the story wrap up (why????)The pacing was terrible. You hardly got a chance to feel and know the characters before things were happening. You felt no sympathy for the girls, who you saw for maybe a few minutes before they got abducted. You didn't share the mum's grief because her acting was so obviously forced. The guy who gets tortured and beaten was (surprise surprise) completely innocent, which was obvious right from the start. The dad is only ever shown stony-faced or blowing his tits in a rage, except for towards the end when his guilt over bashing up a guy who's clearly innocent makes him get stressed and say a few lines of prayer, and then torture the kid some more. And at the end when he finds out the culprit is the kid's aunt, he doesn't even show a single bit of remorse over the horrible thing he's done. Also, the aunt: really? Urgh, so obvious. So tired of the same old formula in every thriller movie: killer turns out to be the one you least expect, someone you were introduced to at the start of the movie, and the crazy story behind them being the unlikeliest killer in the world is revealed only at the end. Halfway through the movie I used that formula to deduce the only person who fit it was the aunt, and prayed to God that this movie wouldn't follow the same boring cliché. But it did, even though they ended up adding a possible suspect later whose storyline they didn't bother to explain and whose purpose was simply to try and lead us off the right trail when they brought out the 'it's the aunt' card right at the end. What was with that guy? Why was he obsessed with pouring pig's blood on kids' clothes? Nobody cares, apparently.Movie makers - if you're going to make the main character some sort of antihero who's morally ambiguous, who does awful things out of desperation, who thinks they're doing the wrong thing for the right reasons, actually put in some effort making us CONNECT with this character. Show us his human side, show him feeling guilt and remorse, show him with his head in his hands saying 'what have I done?', show him feeling worried as hell about his daughter, show him co-operating with the police because he realises that's his best chance of getting his daughter back. Give us a better reason for him taking the law into his own hands than just him thinking he's better than the police at judging who's a criminal and who's not. Show him TRYING to act like a decent human being before succumbing to his emotions and going ballistic. Show him doubting whether what he's doing is really right at all. Show that good side as well as the bad. REALLY show it, because the few moments he showed a sliver of distress, he seemed more angry/upset that the kid wasn't talking than that he may be doing something awful. Because this whole movie I was almost hoping his daughter would die just to serve him right. I felt more hatred towards the father who was alternating between praying to God and torturing a mentally disabled kid than the woman who abducted his child. Epic fail."
"To anyone who misrepresented this movie as being worth more than 3 stars simply because it had a decent cast... I'll make the wild assertion that you don't know what a decent ""crime-drama-thriller"" is. It wasn't thrilling. It wasn't drama. It was just a crime. You could have bigger thrills holding your breath until you pass out from lack of intelligence. It was like Three terrible episodes of Law-and-Order without the good parts, topped off with a weak ending. I hope Hugh Jackman hates this movie. {PAD} {PAD} {PAD} (Attempts to pad the comment with junk words can result in your account being blocked from future submissions.) This movie wasn't worth 10 lines of text."
"The first 15minutes are rather good and gripping, then the plot becomes weaker and stupider by the minute, it made me think they made up the story as they went along filming.You've got one implausible fact and character after another, for one the detective works alone, fails repeatedly to call for backup. The many violent scenes seem purely voyeuristic and don't bring much to the table.Jake Gyllenhaal's acting abilities are terrible (and not only in this movie), he's got two facial expression either the doleful look or a kind of smirk. I watched this movie after reading the NY Times review, please someone fire the journalist who wrote it!"
"On the Thanksgiving, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), his wife Grace (Maria Bello), their teenage son Ralph (Dylan Minnette) and their little daughter Anna (Erin Gerasimovich) go to the home of their neighbors and friends Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard), his wife Nancy (Viola Davis), their teenage daughter Eliza (Zoë Soul) and their little daughter Joy (Kyla-Drew Simmons) to celebrate together in a lunch party. Anna and Joy want to play on the street and Ralph stays with them. The girls play in a ROV and Ralph brings them back home. Later Anna asks her father to go to their house with Joy to seek her emergency whistle and Keller tells her to call Ralph or Eliza to go with them.Later the families realize that the girls went alone have vanished and they call the police department. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is assigned to the case and he arrests the teenager Alex Jones (Paul Dano) that drives the trailer. Soon they learn that Alex has the IQ of a ten year-old boy and he is discharged. When he is leaving the precinct with his aunt Holly Jones (Melissa Leo), Keller presses Alex and he says to Keller that ""the girls have not cried when he left them"". Keller asks to keep Alex imprisoned during the investigations, but Loki cannot hold him anymore. While Detective Loki investigates the pedophiles near the location, Keller decides to abduct Alex to torture him and find where his beloved daughter and her friend are, crossing the thin line between right and wrong. ""Prisoners"" is a mesmerizing, ambiguous and gritty thriller about the kidnapping of two girls by a sick serial-killer. The plot is divided in interesting premises that raise the discussion of what is right and what is wrong when the life of your daughter is in danger. Is Keller right or wrong abducting Alex after listening to what he told him? The police work is flawed, leaving Alex without surveillance just like in the real world. This movie has magnificent cast and cinematography and the story has glimpses of the dark Franc-Dutch ""Spoorloos"" (1988). The open conclusion is another plus in this movie. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Os Suspeitos"" (""The Suspects"")"
"High level performances and directing this product is a result of a merger of the high levels of skill involved, brilliantly structured and put together this account of investigation and reaction is wonderful and heartbreaking in equal measure. The performances are out of this world and the climax is incredible, an all time favourite"
"This movie had a strong character lineup with great acting all around.The plot was solid, typical good guy bad guy storyline.They gave away everything in the movie with little hints of what to expect, as if you were watching a Crime Television show.The ending, this is my biggest peeve. If you spend the time to make a good movie 2 1/2 hours long, FINISH IT.I would have rated this movie an 8 of 10 if it weren't for the terrible ending. This type of ending ruins so many movies. This is the exact reason why people don't pay to see them in theaters anymore, you always end up mad at the end because they couldn't finish it.Just sayin'"
"Some ground rules. Legend has it that the first-time scriptwriter for this oddity was paid a million dollars, and then the project was shelved because they could not figure out what to do with it. Then they had a brainstorm. Just make it. And here we are with an almost-Hitchcockian pseudo-thriller that occasional resembles a police story and even sometimes a horror film. The story gives new life to the cliché, ""plot holes you could drive a truck through."" Hugh Jackman gives the performance of his life, but his character is so lacking in empathy that this might not be enough. Jake Gyllenhaal plays himself which ironically is more than enough to carry the role. Maria Bello is lost. Dennis Villeneuve is a great director who can make even the rain interesting and one would like to see him try his hand at something better written. Like the phone book."
"It was unique and amazing, had my attention the whole way through. One of the best movies I have seen in a while. Brilliant acting and directing. Intense and wonderful. Definitely should and will win numerous awards. I strongly recommend seeing this film. It was a masterpiece and captivating. Acting by Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal was inspiring and chilling. It it was very clever and creative. Deserves a 10/10, it was one of the greatest movies I have ever seen and who ever made it should be knighted and presented with the most highly regarded awards. Spectacular and so good and great just the best ever and wow so good"
"Really surprised that this has garnered so much praise. Many comments talk of great acting performances but as I frequently point out to friends, shouting with intensity is not great acting! I can't believe Hugh Jackman agreed to take such a risible role. You always know you're in trouble when there's SYMBOLISM! The policeman is Loki, Norse God, everyone is 'religious' though nothing stops their sadism,etc. Subtext link to US forces in Iraq - being bad to bad guys just perpetuates the violence. The 2 mothers are ciphers, with no characters, letting the Men do the work! Come on this is 2013! Great cop who's solved every case- yeh, right!- who misses every clue. And at 2 & a half hours...in the end, I didn't care."
"I figured out the most of the plot after the first 45 minutes of this painfully slow moving painfully wannabe suspense movie. 'Prisoners' is self-indulgent mind-numbing fare. It parodies the film noire genre without intending it.The audience is treated as a fool, and the director apparently gets away with it--if the praise showered on this con-job of a movie on IMDb is a reliable indicator. Hugh Jackman out of the Wolverine character is what the audience wanted to see in this film, and he tries hard but he totally wasted in this 2-1/2 overstretched and subdued melodrama.Watching Andy Warhol's slow motion movies at a further half speed would be more entertaining."
"It has some essential ingredients for a good movie, such as some good performance by Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal and Viola Davis, and a good cinematography, but awful script and bad directing. The movie is full packed with stupid gaping holes in the plot, which cannot be digested. The character of the detective is shallow despite the acceptable performance of Gyllenhaal. There are many attempts to make the movie deeper than it is, but in my opinion failed big time. Also,the film had way too many wasted moments. Most of it did nothing to move the story along.Overall, it's disappointing, and I felt I was the prisoner for two and a half hour."
The way movie is reaching its climax is amazing. Jake did a amazing job. Hugh remember me that what it feels like to loose something that you cannot live without. Thrill is amazing.
"Where do I begin with this one.Since Enemy, Denis Villnuve has proven time and time again that any film with his name attached is a film worth seeing. Sharp dialogue, slow but engaging pace, and beautiful cinematography courtesy of longtime collaborator Roger Deacons all mix to form excellent and unique moviegoing experiences from every single one of his movies. Prisoners is no exception. 
While I may have had the misfortune of having to watch this movie over the course of two nights, this movie was still one of the most engaging and haunting films I've seen. Everyone involved with this movie brought fourth their A-game, especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Hugh Jackman, both of whom delivered phenomenal and when needed, explosive performances. The supporting cast does an excellent job as well, especially Viola Davis and Paul Dano. 
The acting is not the only noteworthy part of Prisoners, as Deacon's unique style of camerawork lends itself masterfully to the bleak and hopeless tone, and keeps viewers engaged and attentive towards subtle details in every scene. 
I could go on and list everything I adored about this movie, but the best way to convey to you why this film is a masterpiece is for you to go and watch it yourself. 9.5/10"
"What a disappointment. I'm a huge fan of Denis Villeneuve, I love abduction films, I like the cast... but this movie was just boring. At one point you'll be about 20 minutes ahead of the supposedly genius detective--who doesn't seem to do much detecting whatsoever. The biggest sin of the film is that you don't care about anyone in the film. You don't care who the ""bad"" person is, you don't care if the kids are alive or dead, you don't care about anything and you have a LOT of time to not care about it -- more than two and a half hours! Seriously, at ninety minutes this story MIGHT have been captivating. At 150+ it's mind blowingly dull. None of the characters have any basement--none of them have more than a sentence or two worth of backstory to inform their present, the women characters are absolutely wasted. Poor Maria Bello can never catch a break--her character lies in bed the whole movie. Terrible waste.Viola Davis is the best of the cast--she almost always is, but even she doesn't get much room to do anything. The film also goes for numerous cheap shots, blatantly obvious red herrings with no purpose but to manipulate the audience. What a waste of pretty much everyone involved. Ugh."
"This is the worst movie I have seen in so long I can't remember a worse movie. Perhaps there was one that was worse in the past but this movie is the new champion of ""worst movies I have ever seen in my life"". If you believe that suspects can shoot themselves while under custody at police stations and torturers can stay out of prison after being found out, then this movie might be for you, especially if you enjoy watching torture. They even throw in a pedophile priest who murders a murderer. After all Hollywood can never resist a slam at Catholicism given Hollywood's high moral compass. I rarely write reviews but this piece of crud is such a waste of time that I'm writing it for those people that enjoy Hugh Jackson (I like his stuff) and want to see a movie with him in it. Even the acting stunk the place up, including Hugh's (I guess torture really isn't his bag). If I could give this movie a minus 1000 I would."
"Prisoners is the latest in a long line of critically revered movies- the type of film that gets revered to death by critics and makes it into a number of ""best of the year"" lists that has me wondering if I somehow got conned into seeing a fraudulent copy of the movie, or if the critics have either temporarily or permanently lost their minds. No doubt a lot of films have left me with that feeling this year (Gravity being another example), but Prisoners may be the worst example. And there's also no doubt in my mind that this film is widely loved by those film school students who only seem to love ""film"" and not mainstream movies, probably out of sheer fear that they'll probably enjoy one. And what makes it so bizarre that I'm saying this is that Prisoners isn't a bad movie at all. Sure, bizarre, pretentious and way in over its head at times? Maybe. But for the first half at least, the audience can assure themselves that they're about to watch a quality suspense-drama about what a parent does when their kid inexplicably goes missing.No doubt, the first half of this film is incredibly solid and for a while, I was positive that I was wrong about any misgivings I had. It's well filmed, even. Then again, anything shot by Roger Deakins will look really pretty. The film's slow and meditative pace was also a big factor in keeping the film grounded, because it almost made it feel as if everything was happening in real time. When the parents find out their kids have gone missing, their desperation feels incredibly real. Hell, I didn't mind when they brought in Paul Dano in as a suspect as soon as they did, because it did make for some interesting brain work. In particular, the scene where Hugh Jackman encounters him in the parking lot and Dano distinctly whispers, ""They only cried when I left them..."" was brilliantly executed. However, it's when a second suspect named Bob (yeah, it's not like I haven't seen films about kids gone missing where the kidnapper/pedophile is named Bob... get real) is brought in, where the film takes a turn for the worst. This is where the film degenerates into a mess of subplots that go nowhere, over-wrought symbolism and a conclusion that is utterly ridiculous and insulting. There are some problems early on in the film and moments where the film comes off as weak, but at least it has the performances and cinematography to fall back on. But it's here where the problems become obvious.Alright, let's ignore all the plot holes, big or small, but no matter how big or small the holes hare, it's hard to deny the second half of the movie is full of them. Let's ignore the fact that the film pretty much only happens because of a ridiculous amount of coincidences (so this kid was molested but so was this kid and this one other guy is a suspect because he was molested by this priest guy who trapped this guy for molesting kids who may or may not have been trying to turn kids into molesters and so forth...). Let's ignore the fact that there's enough red herrings in the film to make Dan Brown wince.The second half of the film pretty much is aggressively poorly written and goes out of its way to be as stupid as it possibly can, while trying to pass off as smart- which, if the reviews here are any indication, seems to have worked for the most part. Detective Loki, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, is set up to be this oh-so-perfect and excellent detective who apparently is infallible and has never left a case unsolved. Perhaps they named him Detective Loki because Marty Stu was too revealing. And strangely, we never get any evidence of this and we often see him making dumb decisions (like going twice into people's houses unattended, opening suspicious looking tote boxes that could be filled with something harmful- venomous snakes in this case). The aforementioned paedophile corpse found in the paedophile priest's basement has a bit where he discovers a maze necklace on said corpse (it's never explained why the priest tortured the kid rapist and murderer because HE HIMSELF IS A PAEDOPHILE) and passes it off as just something he wears, but then it takes a drawing just conveniently falling off his desk to make the connection? Oh, and what is it with this film's obsession with mazes? Bob draws them a lot and there's a bunch crudely etched on his wall, and Dano's character keeps repeating something like ""There's a maze..."" over and over. Then there's the scene during the ultra- lame twist where Melissa Leo, who apparently kidnapped the kids, forces Jackman to hide in a hole covered by a car... great! This must be the maze! But nope, it's just some hole. Oh, and what is this connection between Leo and Dano, and this Bob guy??? He buys kids clothes and splatters them with pigs blood and hides venomous snakes in his home as a ploy to trick the detectives and the families, but their connection is never revealed.Perhaps why this is such a killer is because there's evidence that there's a great movie bursting to get out of here in this 152-minute mess. There's great acting by Hugh Jackman and Terrence Howard, there's some every pretty cinematography, Villenueve's direction is as tight as ever. I had high hopes for this film, especially being from Canada, where the director is from, however I doubt that it'll be as much of a hit with the audiences as Incendies was, because the film simply thinks it's being clever. But it isn't. And it's about as obvious as a light show at a Muse concert, to make matters worse."
"a complete waste of time, full of errors and nonsense e.g. what value do the teenage boy and girl add to the movie?, is Jake gyllenhal the only cop in town?, the guy locked up in that little prison is bleeding, without food or water for over a week and he is alive?, underestimates the audience's intelligence. initially i thought this was all about getting the two little girls ala ""taken"", but the movie goes nowhere. It is painfully slow and runs on a really poor scenario. the birch's don't take any initiative to get their daughter back? they just follow Keller's approach?! instead of screaming HELP, Keller uses his daughter's whistle?! really?!absolutely ridiculous...seems like people had money, threw it together with big name actors, and voilà, a motion picture for the masses...not impressed!i do not know how it got a rating of 8.1!!! totally misleading.. "
"I usually agree with IMDb's ratings but unfortunately not this time, This movie was mediocre at best and really nothing we haven't seen before, A lot of Clichés and suspense tricks we've already seen in other movies of this type, I could not really relate to the characters and felt that the dialogs were corny and that I have already seen them on other movies. I could have given it a 7 but it was way way way too long, Could have easily fit into 90 minutes instead of 153 !!! To tell the truth I fast forwarded at least 30 minutes of the movie because I just got bored. The acting and plot were believable for the first hour but after that it got too much for me to even care, This is really NOT the masterpiece everybody here are talking about."
"Prisoners was absolutely one of the best films I have seen in a while. Ranging from story line to acting, you can't find a dull moment in this film to sit down and say ""I'm actually not enjoying myself"". This movie will keep you at the edge of your seat through it's 2-hour length and you will began to actually use your brain to follow the case along with Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) to find the two lost daughters. Going into this movie, I honestly didn't think I would like it. The previews looked suspenseful and I wanted to see a nice crime movie that I had never seen before, but once the credits started rolling I really had to sit back in my seat and think about what a mind-blowing experience it all is. This movie will keep you up at night just thinking about it, whether it gives you the creeps or a quick laugh over something that happened, this movie really impacts your life when you sit down and watch it in that dark room with your friends, family, or even by yourself. This is a dark movie, not one where you feel for the bad guy or where the good guy gets taken and you hear the life story of the villain, this movie shows just what happens out there when you have no idea what is going on. Humans will do whatever they have to just to find what has happened to whatever you are looking for (objects to people) and this movie shows just what a father would go through for his daughter. Of course, it doesn't show you how to cope with the loss of a loved one, but it does show you a lot of dad's points of view when they think about what they would go through to get their son/daughter back. Hugh Jackman shows this really well throughout the movie by showing us just how angry he can get. I would recommend this to everyone that likes the actors or likes a good story line and I hope you guys can see this first hand in the the theaters for yourself."
"Prisoners is the kind of movie that has little to no action, but is more of a watch to see details and listen closely dialogue. It starts out joyful and happy, almost immediately it is filmed (and acted) so that it is incredibly realistic and relatable. Things change drastically when the two little girls just vanish into thin air. Now, I won't give away spoilers because I don't want to ruin this movie for anybody but let me tell you this, it is incredibly wrong and at times a little slow but it holds true to the realism of these kind of events. You bite your nails wondering where the children are and you begin to doubt if Hugh Jackman is doing the right thing by abducting (and torturing) a boy who he thinks took the girls. Each parent is shown as they spiral downward from fear, anger and loss. Jake Gyllenhaal gives his best performance as Detective Loki, his bad ass attitude slowly chipping away into desperation. The movie may not be the best out there but emotionally, it makes you question how far you would go to find the person you love and just how hard will you cling to the belief that you are right."
"If I could give a rating of less than 1, I would. The best part of the movie was the trailers of coming releases.Had I left after the trailers, I would have been better off.After a good suspenseful start, this movie drags on and on with no clear connections between events.The characters are not really convincing in their roles, except for maybe Mr. Dover.Unless the story is deliberately trying to convey ineptness on the part of the characters, there are far too many missed connections between elements introduced early in the story.As Lisa Simpson says, ""it is just a bunch of stuff that happened.""A better crime drama can be seen on any syndicated police story.It is a major disappointment. It is as if the writers or actors just got tired and called it a day when they hit to 2:30 mark."
"Wow, I should have put a clothes pin on my nose before sitting down in the theater because the ""Prisoner"" just plain stank.And Hugh Jackman is supposed to be better in this than in ""Les Miserables?"" Good God. Lock up the screwballs who actually tell you this nonsense.Of course the story line is about two young girls taken while their parents whoop it up in the next room but in no way can this film come close to ""Taken."" The only one taken is the guy who spends an admission price to see this ""Prisoners"" bomb. And so with Jackman's daughter and Terence Howard's daughter kidnapped, Terrence keeps cool while Hugh go bonkers beating up everyone in sight. Screaming, effing everyone, banging heads, beating people to a pulp, locking people up in makeshift closets...I mean it's as if Hugh had lost big time at a roulette wheel in the Mirage.The superior acting belongs to Jake Gyllenhaal, the head detective assigned to the case. He's kept busy as all hell trying to keep a lid on Hugh's head about to explode and on the analyses of data that offer clues to the whereabouts of the young girls. He blinks and twitches during the film but I'm not sure if it's part of the act or fear of wild man Jackman beating him between takes.The movie is OVERLONG by at least 30-45 minutes. It drags unmercifully. The plot is complicated but I figured out right away that the popcorn was too salty. I'm a BIG Hugh Jackman fan. I've seen him in person on the Broadway stage twice.He's enormously talented but oh how this picture conceals it. SAVE YOUR MONEY or have a clothes pin handy."
"So the film starts with a promising air to it, the pace is good and you're thinking oooo this is gonna be good... That's short livedThe rest of the film is just long drawn out randomness... It was 80/90% predictable throughout.There are tons of wtf are you doing moments too...There are a couple scenes where the director must have said to the editor ""whatever, do whatever you want"". The story seems all chronological and then There is a random leap forward which suggested that they had way too much footage and had struggled to squeeze into an already extra long movie...I mean if you can tell the story in an hour and half you're not doing it right..,seems these days 2 hours is standard but this goes into 2.5 hours! And then instead of ending where it should have and throwing in the culminating scenes all together they drag it out some more and try to be clever with an open ending roll credits moment where you sit there for a second in disbelief than they could have the audacity to do that to viewers.. Then you look at the others in the room and everyone sighs and huge wtf kind of ending was that."
"It's very troubling that this movie was even nominated for ANY award. The actors were fine but the script and directing was just ridiculous. The director had no idea how to connect the dots. I'm not making a spoiler here because there are so many loop holes in this it's like Swiss cheese.I did get a screener for this but it's insulting that Warner Bros. should send this out to even be considered for an award. People who ""thought"" they had a handle on this garbage should watch it again because you screwed up the 1st time. The director needs one good swift kick in the pants."
"Writing about James Fennimore Cooper, D.H. Lawrence said, ""the essential American soul is hard, stoic, isolate and a killer. It has never yet melted."" Prisoners is a Canadian director's meditation on this passage.Michael Mann's The Last of the Mohicans opened with Hawkeye shooting a deer and then praying over the dead animal. Prisoners opens with Keller Dover (Jackman) saying the Lord's Prayer as his teenaged son sights in and shoots the deer that will be Thanksgiving dinner. The parallel is no accident. Dover thinks of himself as the Deerslayer. He's a self-employed, self-reliant workman with a basement full of canned goods and ammunition stored against the breakdown of society, which he expects at any time. He's a survivalist and a handloader. He lives in a nondescript former industrial town somewhere in the part of Pennsylvania that James Carville described as Alabama. His suburban house is the smallest in the neighborhood, with the siding stained dark brown, looking like a log cabin. His only vehicle is the pickup truck from his contracting business. He seems to have come down in the world from his late father, whom he revered, and he's just barely keeping up with the mortgage. Though not a political word is spoken, he's prime Tea Party material. His belief in himself and his disdain for institutions are going to be tested to the extreme when his five year old daughter and her neighborhood playmate disappear, victims of an apparent abduction, on Thanksgiving afternoon.This is a foreigner's take on the United States. The director, Denis Villeneuve, is a French-Canadian whose last movie, 2010s Incindies, was a perceptive look at the Lebanon civil war of the 70s and 80s. Villeneuve is looking at a society whose individualism, distrust of authority, and general availability of firearms are very different from Canada, and he does not take those things for granted in the same way an American director would. Prisoners makes an interesting companion to this summer's Still Mine, a Canadian story about an old fashioned self-employed individualist who falls foul of local authority in rural New Brunswick. I've long thought that the Canadians are King George's dutiful children while Americans are his rebellious ones, and the two pictures set off the contrast nicely. This is an anthropological look by a Canadian at what a very American man like Keller Dover might do when his child is kidnapped.Villeneuve uses one of the more annoying tropes in American movies to humanize Dover – the Validating Black Guy. Cousin to the Magic Negro, who puts the white protagonist in touch with deeper values, the VBG's function is simpler – to show that this white man, regardless of his other faults, is actually all right because he likes black people and they like him. Dover's neighbor, friend and one-time high school buddy Franklin Birch (Howard) and wife Nancy (Davis) are cast as black because otherwise Keller Dover would come across as a complete redneck.But the essence of the Birches is class, not race. They live in a nicer house and are much more securely in the middle class than the Dovers. Nancy's a veterinarian and Franklin looks like he has some kind of office job. Their function is to react as decent, normal middle class folks would when their daughter is abducted and when Dover goes off the rails looking for the kidnapper. The parallel with our reactions to 9/11 is pretty obvious, but that's not where the movie ultimately goes.The spousal relations break pretty clearly along class and historical lines. Nancy and Franklin Birch are a contemporary married couple of the upper middle class. They pull each other through. He confides in her, she's probably the stronger of the pair, and her moral judgments are the last word between them. The Dovers are almost 19th century. Grace Dover (an under-used Maria Bello) is passive; a pure housewife who looks to Keller as her protector and hero. She breaks completely under the strain, spending all of her time in bed under sedation. Her husband is content to have it so, keeping his activities secret and warning his son not to let his mother know what is going on.Dover's opposite number and antagonist is Detective Loki, the star of this small town police force, and apparently the only detective on the case. (I find this improbable. For a crime like the abduction of two five year old girls, a one horse police department would get overwhelming support from State Police detectives). Loki is zealous, smart, though not as smart as he thinks, and willing to fall back on shouting and violence when nothing else seems to work. He's cracked every case he ever worked on, and he expects to crack this one. He's also got the official mindset that regards Keller Dover's insistent involvement as a clear nuisance if not something worse. But he's got far more energy and drive than his police chief, a mediocre man who has learned to rationalize mediocrity with philosophical resignation.The plot is full of trap doors and red herrings, and you have to pay very close attention to the dialog to pick up what you need to know. Even if you do, I think that one key element is left unexplained. You will be completely involved in what comes next for two and one-half hours, and there will be a lot to chew on when it's over. Definitely worth it."
"This movie implies the idea that torturing someone for days is forgivable in response to a supposed kidnapping. It seems that it is OK to do justice with your own hands.Besides, throughout the movie, Hugh Jackman's character keeps breaking the law numerous times. He drives recklessly, ""drink and drive"", etc., again with the implied message that it is OK for this matter.Moreover, the boy who drives the van (Alex) clearly had mental issues. He should have been sent to a mental illness hospital, which would be able to better understand him. Movie is full of mistakes and the message sent is against the law."
"Prisoners (2013)A highly rated movie at the moment, but be sure to know this is very well- worked territory, and it's a well made but conventionally made movie. There are some plot surprises but they won't be new ones. There is a detective (well played by Jake Gyllenhaal) but he's a familiar type. There is the parent (four parents, but one in particular, played by Hugh Jackman) who does some terrible things trying to find his daughter—but even this is now old territory (even Mel Gibson took that on).You won't have to suffer the mistreatment of little kids here, which is something some directors would explore and abuse. This is a story about the urgent hunting of the kidnappers before time ran out. There is no real clock to heighten our anxiety, just the feeling that the longer it goes on the more likely the children aren't going to make it. Mostly we follow the detective around as he follows leads and instincts, and the one dad who has his own idea of who's to blame.There is no good rationale for the kidnappings, either. Not money, which would have been easy, but some kind of religious freak craziness is to blame. An obsession with mazes creeps in, but even this we don't quite get. No, the specifics are endlessly avoided. Instead we are dependent on personality, and to some extent that works pretty well. It doesn't make for a whole movie, however.Director Denis Villeneuve has an interesting resume, including the hard-hitting ""Incendies"" which has (unlike this movie) a clear and sensational plot line. I'm not sure what made his drag this movie to an hour and a half—some economy might have been the main thing it needed, though the lack of explanation almost makes it seem a half hour has been excised already.Lots of people will not agree with me (apparently) but as a ""useful"" review I'm really trying to lay out the basic qualities that you can then judge for yourself. Bottom line? It's not boring even if it seems long, and it's a kind of film I like so I enjoyed it in a mild kind of way. That's a start!"
"A movie about an old lady kidnapping small kids and giving them drugs with a needle... Wow!!! and a parent losing it and torturing a guy with a deformed face in an abandoned property of his, which he cannot repair due to economic problems. I think that movie adds to the mission of cinema and cinematography in general. No wonder why there are so many weirdos overseas... And I have to write ten lines the least for my movie review to b posted. So I'll start say awful things about this movie... Don't even try to press play on this movie it doesn't worth it. The Spiderman guy tries to act as a detective and the Wolverine guy tries to act as a family guy. The first has a tick and I believe that's why this movie is having an 8.1 average in IMDb and the latter has a problem with alcohol and he can't be convincing for even a second. Ahhh my ten lines (or more) are complete. Go Away from this so called movie. GO AWAY!!!"
"The beginning of the movie was fine, good with the RV and the girls leaving. The movie really fell apart when they brought the Alex guy into the police station. They say he has a low IQ so he couldn't have done it alone. OK thats great but why then would you not look at his guardian after that? And he was a kidnapped boy himself so wouldn't he be in the system? I know he was not arrested , but seems to me they would check more then his name for a double kidnapping. Not to mention he wouldn't has a ssn and they can tell when he got it under that name which would lead to a DNA test anyway.After that though he is kidnapped and again by Jackman character. Why would that detective who has never lost a case not think to finish searching the residence finding him. Also don't these family men have jobs? Plus no captain would leave him without a car to watch him in the first place. Aside from that they have these clues to finding the girls like the maze, and chose to instead lead this line of Jackmans character torturing Alex. They do not have any part of this movie dedicated to what's going on with the girls so glad I didn't spend money when this was in theaters. Acting was good has a good plot with the kidnapping just done very wrong after the first few scenes. Very unrealistic from a legal stand point. Also did a bad job of keeping me engaged I paused the movie about halfway through to check my phone and facebook even got on youtube. Writing and directing failed this movie its a shame."
"This film has absolutely no redemptive value. Filled with great actors and yet the story is full of plot holes, unbelievable dialog and disrespectful to the audience's intelligence. How did it ever get made?!? Do NOT watch this film. AND, the snake scene is absurd! There is not one character in the entire film who is someone that draws you in or evokes sympathy or empathy. By the end of the film I was hoping a meteor would fly out of the sky, hit the town and blow up the entire place! Two and a half hours and $6.99 (Amazon.com) gone from my life! By the end I felt like I was the one held prisoner and tortured. I really hated it."
"7. Rain. Constant rain and snow. The story is gloomy, I get it. Does it also have to be relentlessly dark and poorly lit?6. When was the last time you watched any decent film, or TV show for that matter, where a sensational headline-grabbing crime against children is investigated by one-- count him, one-- detective. This small town may have limited resources, but when two young girls go missing, even a two-man department puts both men on it. When Jackman blames Gyllenhaal personally for not finding the girls quickly, it took a few seconds for my eyes to roll back into place.5. Nobody locks their doors. Even AFTER the girls go missing, one of the possible bad guys walks into both of their houses, while people are at home, and steals items. Easy peasy.4. The Paul Dano character endures 10 hours of interrogation by Gyllenhaal, then when he is released, suddenly whispers a clue to one of the fathers (Hugh Jackman), which no one else can hear, and therefore no one believes. The result is Jackman capturing and torturing Dano for a week-- and he still won't talk. Why not? So the filmmakers can have him tortured twice.3. The other suspect (David Dastmalchian), another man who was once kidnapped and abused, keeps trunks full of snakes in his house. Evidently, this is just to scare the police, and the audience, but it only confuses things.2. Okay, I know this will be about as popular as saying that Ryan Gosling actually looks like a gosling (which he does), but here goes: Jake Gyllenhaal has one expression: doleful. Given how dumb his character is, that almost works. Still, you'd think that an animal expression would cross his countenance occasionally.1. Motivation. While we drown in motivation for Jackman's vigilantism, little motivation is provided for the crime(s). We're told the kidnappings are the perpetrators' way of ""getting back at God"" because their son died. It's a lazy, trumped-up reason for a thriller. And the balance is way off. The filmmakers wallow in the torture of innocent suspects, motivated by ""good"" characters (Jackman, Howard, Davis), while the real villain is hardly seen until the end, and the motive for having tortured children is only mentioned in passing. It's amoral film-making. By the time the movie is over, my relief and apathy were so great that all I wanted was escape. If I'd had a toy whistle, I'd have been just like Hugh Jackman at that point."
"what was this maze all about? i thought at end there could be something about that maze. what was that bob taylor story about? the captor knows one of her captives has escaped yet makes NO EFFORT to leave, clean up evidence, DO ANYTHING AT ALL, just stays there. HOW did the black girl escape! Her & her friend were drugged all the time? Oh, she just ""managed"" to get away -- she's in a locked room! Drugged! But she ""manages"" to get away . . . and another oh! her captor couldn't catch her! But the captor managed to get them the first time in broad daylight -- which is never explained! guy gets beaten & imprisoned in a cube of pain for a week, yet can't manage to articulate ""my aunt did it."" He was coherent enough to say ""They only cried when I left them"" to Hugh Jackman when Hugh Jackman grabs him by the throat in public; but he can't manage ""after my aunt took them away"" when Hugh Jackman beats him nearly to death? bad ending.several things unfold"
"My friends raved and raved about this movie so I was very excited to see and probably had too high expectations? I. HATED. This. Movie.First of all, it dragged on foooorrrreeevvvveeerrrrr. It felt like I was sitting there for 5 hours. Yes it was enjoyable to try and guess whodunnit but I am so angry about the ending that it ruined the rest of it for me.Obviously I won't spoil it for anyone but be warned IT CUTS OFF! You sit through all of that, they don't show outcomes of a few characters, and you're waiting for your happy ending closure and then BAM! Credits. I can't believe I wasted that much time when I could have knocked at least 2 other movies off my list that night. Nothing, I repeat NOTHING makes me angrier than a movie with no closure. It's designed so that you can assume what happens but screw that, if I have to sit there and go through all that stuff just to leave it up to my imagination what happens in the end it's automatically failed. My other pet peeve is that Jake Gyllenhaal was a terrible cop. Not that his acting was bad, but his character itself was retarded. He was ALWAYS alone, never followed protocol, never let anyone know where he was and that is just bad writing. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because I've seen worse.If you are like me and need closure and answers, DO NOT waste your time on this movie."
"SPOILERSThey threw the movie away in the third act! A very competently-made, suspenseful piece, albeit with some of the whiff of anxiety-exploitation around child abduction that, say, The Pledge has, but impressively and seriously put together. A lot of the revelations are guessable, but it'll keep you watching. Yet - in the end - you may wish you'd spent your time watching something else. Because it doesn't pay off.There are many holes, but one key howler.For me, the film makers threw it all away with one piece of ""let's go down to that spooky graveyard"" plotting. With a jigsaw puzzle this intricate, everything has to be plausible or it all feels like a confection. And when Hugh Jackman runs off - alone, actively avoiding the police and preventing them from accompanying him - to confront the abductor, after learning a key piece of information in the hospital, all credibility goes out the window. HJ's character (Dover) simply has no reason to eschew the police's help once he learns that he has already been at the place where the children are being held. (Which narrows the options right down).The discovery of one of the missing girls changes everything. And acting on evidence gleaned from her is not something the police would resist. A bunch of talented actors and film makers let all their efforts go to waste due to this failure of plotting and motivation. It takes you right out of the movie. Of course, the whistle contrivance eventually makes it feel as if maybe this action doesn't seal Dover's fate (though the ending's ambiguity is a bit of a cop out). But - crucially - this piece of implausible action means that by the end we've kind of bailed.As for the aftertaste, the more you think about it, the more the 'plausible offscreen action' on which this kind of plot and edit relies, is inadequate.If you watch the flashback, which shows the first captive escaping, carefully you'll see that nasty Melissa Leo is held back by a hooded figure, which is how the little girl gets away. We see beige-hooded-coat-guy grab her from behind as she pursues the little girl, and then cut to the girl running and running.Now, there's only one beige hoodie guy in the film - it's creepy Bob Taylor, who by the time we see the flashback, has killed himself in police custody.So: why? Why did he kill himself? And/or why did he help little Joy Birch escape?If he meant for her to escape, why not just tell the cops and be a hero?And if he feels guilty enough to kill himself (why?), what was his motivation to save the girl?None of this is made even remotely clear.We could speculate that it's because he's a loon due to long exposure to LSD (if we think he's another abductee of Melissa Leo's character and her late husband - and this is suggested by the snakes he had; Leo's character says her husband kept snakes). Or maybe he feels guilty that he only managed to help one girl flee.But at this point in the story all he has to give is factual account of what happened and he'd be OK.Likewise, why does Alex withhold the information?Presumably we're supposed to presume that Holly Jones (Leo) had some intense brainwashy psychological hold over both boys. But that's a lot of presuming.So, the plot holes got in the way here. And, as is often the case, the film-makers papered over the cracks with some ambiguity and vagueness which the less discerning will take for artful and intentional ambiguity which makes the film soooo much more interesting.But it's not. It's just shoddy plotting dressed up."
After 90 minutes you just want it all to end!I'm growing awfully tired of movies that just make no sense whatsoever and then just to compound your misery there's 3 or 4 pieces of the jigsaw left out of the storyline which just leaves you scratching your head at the end and wondering what's actually happened?The girls' abduction was just so abrupt and sudden you just never had a chance to make any connection or have any emotive feelings for their plight to begin with. That sort of set the tone for the rest of the movie - flat and devoid of feeling.I'm still unsure as to the motive behind the abduction and drugged imprisonment of the 2 young girls - let alone what part the mentally impaired adopted son and the detached other member of the family that likes snakes and purchases children's clothing have played in proceedings?Yet another film that's not been particularly well directed or edited and should have went straight to DVD or held back strictly for TV. I just can't imagine sitting in a cinema watching this for 2 and a half hours. You'd have a numb brain as well as a numb bum!4 stars solely to Jake for adding an element or two of tension and drama throughout.
"This is a movie about two families and their two little girls that vanish unexpectedly one afternoon. This story will make you experience one of every man's worst fears. Loosing your child. You will feel compassion, pain, quilt, doubt, conflict. The acting is amazing and i must admit, i had a long time to enjoy a movie purely for its acting instead of its visual effects or the complex story. The plot is simple but interesting, with a few twists that will keep you on edge until the end. Despite the length of the film, i did not get bored at any point. Both Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal do a terrific job and i can not imagine anyone better for their roles. The rest of the cast is evenly good and the actor playing the prime suspect fits perfectly the part. All in all, it is a movie that will make you feel sentiments to the extreme and that is quite rare nowadays. I recommend it undoubtedly!"
"This film was on cable one night. It lost steam quickly as the story became bogged down with pointless silly situations. The plot meandered so much that I had to read the synopsis as the story progressed. If you have a PVR and your recorded it, feel free to stop it and check other movies on cable. That's what I did. However, I did finish watching it. If this movie had been quiet throughout, it would have helped insomniacs to finally get a good night's sleep. Watching paint dry is a better alternative. One of the ironies of this film has to do with one of its producers - Mark Wahlberg. Wahlberg was one of the leads in Peter Jackson's, ""The Lovely Bones."" Prisoners is a poor ripoff of that movie. The Lovely Bones was a superior film in every respect. Prisoners isn't a film that's worth watching more than once. The Lovely Bones is."
"Story was good. But I don't think it could have been directed any worse. First of all movie was extremely slow. The pacing the timing was so awful. There were a lot of unnecessary scenes that could have been shortened or not used in the movie at all. I can say at at least 1 hour of the movie could be cut out and the story wouldn't change, in fact it would be better. The slow rhythm of the movie made it like drama more than a thriller. There were parts where it got really really boring. Jake Gyllenhaal's bad acting made the movie even worse. And it had the worse ending ever. The only thing good about the movie is Hugh Jackman. He's kind of saving the movie with his great acting. Other than I can say that it has a good and strong story, but unfortunately turns out to be a really bad movie."
"While watching this film, you will imagine the parents who desperately struggle to protect their children from the evil of the outside. And you will see how the children vanished right before their eyes. The worst fears are let out and the families are facing cruel reality: someone took their babies and hided them. None knows ""why"": why children, why they're not telling where, why to kidnap anybody at all? Maybe it's because of their sickness, maybe because of money, or there is no particular reason, who can tell? Aren't they're prisoners of their own sick mind, desperately wanting to catch an innocence, a freedom, a symbol of it? And the parents are in pain, in enormous fear, like in a black hole, doing everything: possible and impossible, imaginable and unseen and unheard, only to find them. This film is rising up some questions, maybe they're old ones, but in a whole new perspective, and you only have to take the look... You will not be disappointed."
"After viewing this film, my wife and I argued about whose fault it was we had borrowed it from the library. I insisted she was responsible; she said I chose it.We don't understand why this has rated so highly with other viewers. There are so many absolutely absurd holes in this plot that we spent more time pointing them out to each other than watching the film. The soundtrack was poor, which was unfortunate, so we often missed key words or sentences and that didn't help, I'll admit. But it really was the writing of the plot that put us off. If actions taken by the characters don't make sense, then we lose interest and that's what happened with us about an hour in.I'll not bother saying more than that as it would constitute spoiler after spoiler if I picked apart what we saw. You can make up your own mind if you watch it and perhaps you'll make more sense of some of the characters' actions than we did.I'll just end by saying that it might try to be a modern ""Silence of the Lambs"", but it falls far short of that high standard."
"I had such big expectations for this movie. The trailer made it look very interesting. And, I love thrillers. I love Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello. In fact, all the actors did a very good job. However, this seemed to me no more than a Criminal Minds episode stretched to over two hours. The storyline was all over the place. The end result made sense, but took too long to get there, leaving trails never completely followed, or throwing things in that were never explained (like Jackman's not drinking for 9 1/2 years). And the end... well, unless they're doing a sequel, the end just left me thinking ""that's it?"". I'd prefer to watch Mystic River again than this."
"Prisoners is a thriller which achieves a rare level of intensity and resonance thanks to the director's ability to invest the story with authenticity, emotion and originality. Compared with, say, 'The Silence of the Lambs' this slow-paced (a compliment, as the usual hyperactive pacing of Hollywood is almost a sickness) bleak mainstream film is hands down a better movie, making Demme's seem trivial, in hindsight. What I loved about Prisoners is the way that it was all about the story and the characters; the visual style was invisible and never imposed itself on the viewer. It was wonderfully directed in a manner that recalled classics by Nicolas Ray(They Live By Night), William Wyler(Desperate Hours), Billy Wilder(Double Indemnity) or John Ford (The Searchers). You could just walk into this terrifying film and feel the emotions portrayed flawlessly by the cast. The best example being perhaps Maria Bello who is my choice for best supporting actress this year with special mention going to Gyllenhaal whose idiosyncratic performance is at the heart of this film; his effortless charisma and skill place him among the very best, he is also a natural audience favorite capable of earning a very high level of empathy for his work."
"Police 101: Never enter an interview room with your duty weapon. This movie displays why.Police 102: When a person is examined and displays the mentality of a 10 year-old, yet possess a driving license, a detective worth his weight would enquire at the license office how this came to pass. Something might be learnt which sheds light on the reality of the displayed behaviour. Something a seasoned detective would not ignore.Other law enforcement failures, but the movie does do well otherwise.Jackman and Gyllenhaal play very believable characters. I was quite impressed with Jackman's part. His emotions are running wild as he wants his child found. And Gyllenhaal does well feeling stymied by the system and a Captain who is more worried about perception and budget than solving crimes. Great acting on all parts. Very enjoyable film."
"Narrative that follows the 'whodunnit' approach often relies on the climactic twist. Herein lies the craftsmanship of the filmmaker to keep you on the edge even if there is nothing but a simple conversation is going on the screen. You can feel the Hitchcockian bomb is there somewhere. David Fincher showed us how to hold the suspense throughout the film in his early works. Dennis Villeneuve here pretty much did a similarly splendid job.Two families see their worlds go upside down, when their two very young daughters go missing, presumably abducted. When the adept detective has to let the primary suspect go, due to lack of evidences, the father of one child takes it to himself to find the daughters. Sounds familiar? Yes, the premise is quite similar to that of a Mystic River or a Zodiac.But, the defining feature of this film would be that, every now and then it justifies its title and asks you question about who the real prisoner is. For it is us who put ourselves in the most impregnable prisons. As we see the father, Keller (Hugh Jackman) shredding his values one by one; the obsession, the pain are felt by the audience.Like mentioned earlier, it is one thing to build a premise that promises suspense; and, I am going a bit Jerry Seinfeld way here, it is a different thing altogether to 'hold' the suspense throughout the film. Credit goes to Aaron Guzikowski for the always-engaging and compelling script. Villeneuve hardly mismatches the pace of the story or loses the grip in the screenplay. Some might disagree, but I think the plot is divided in two sub-plots. One that follows the premise where the detective Loki, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, relentlessly pursues the kidnapper. The other is where Keller is the protagonist; that always makes us wonder how far people can go for the love of family.When you get a cast like the one this film has, you get the chance to explore various ranges of emotion and actually get to build characters, which is not very regular in typical thriller films. The support cast was stellar with the likes of Maria Bello, Terrence Howard, Viola Davies, the astonishingly refrained Melissa Leo and Paul Dano, who not surprisingly revels in his almost-silent, reserved character. Each one of them showing their acting prowess in turns. But, it is the leads that will sweep off your feet with their performances. Both Jackman and Gyllenhaal give knock-out performances as theirs were the more layered characters in the film.The final punch of the film comes from Johann Johannsson's haunting compositions and Roger Deakins' masterful work. Just sets up the grim mood of the film. Deakins' craftsmanship's best moment would be at the end, where he creates magic on screen with the city lights.5/5"
"Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal are absolutely powerful in Director Denis Villeneuve's dark and mesmerizing ""Prisoners"". ""Prisoners"" has the look and resonance of Clint Eastwood's ""Mystic River"". This haunting morality play is one of best movies of the year. Jackman gives perhaps his best and most unexpected performance. Jackman's sheer ferocity in the tipping point of human conscience is amazing to behold. His bold vulnerability clutches our very soul. This is equally surprising given his signature as the Wolverine. I literally cringed as he threatens terrified Paul Dano as Alex with a steel hammer. In stark contrast there is a quiet scene as tears stream down his cheek as he stares at police photos. Gyllenhaal as Jackman's antagonist foil is an undeniable force. Much like Kevin Bacon in ""Mystic River"" Gyllenhaal's Detective Loki struggles between duty and the visceral justice. Villeneuve and Writer Guzikowski curiously never spell out Loki's physical glitches neither the gang banger tattoos. Have to admire them for respecting audience intelligence. Gyllenhaal's immersion is breathtaking whether he is comforting Viola Davis's Nancy about her missing daughter or smashing the head of suspect on a table. His screen partnership with Jackman is awesome, we witness amazing actors at the zenith of their prowess. Villeneuve is brilliant in restraining and balancing such intense performances without sacrificing purpose. We first hear Jackman's voice as Keller Dover reciting The Lord's Prayer on a deer hunting trip with his son Ralph (Dylan Minnette, who is going to surprise many). Keller is a struggling carpenter, and closet survivalist. He is a family man and man of faith. Aaron Guzikowski's story's deceptive power lies in the normalcy of a Pennsylvania suburb. He foreshadows the tragic forfeit as the ends overcome the means. Roger Deakins's (""True Grit"") cinematography is a profound character onto itself bestowing pristine clarity in this conflict of dark and gray. The Dovers' spend Thanksgiving with Frank and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis). The terrifying realization sets in that their youngest daughters Anna (Erin Gerasimovich) and Joy (Kyla Drew Simmons) are missing. After frantic search in the rain, Police are called. A creepy suspect Alex Jones (brilliantly unnerving Paul Dano) emerges as the possible kidnapper. Alex also has the mind of a 10 year old. Alex is released without any solid evidence. However, Keller is convinced from an admission by Alex, that he knows where his daughter Anna is. He takes matters into his own, and imprisons Alex and tortures him until he tells him what he wants. Howard's Franklin is mortified by Keller's actions. Keller says, ""Someone had to make him talk, or they're going to die!"" Viola Davis as Nancy is rock solid in shocking advocacy. Mario Bello as Keller's wife Grace is sympathetic grace as a mother suffering the unthinkable. Melissa Leo is amazing as Holly Jones, Alex's Aunt and guardian. Her ordinary persona belies tragedy.All is not what seems. Keller and Loki have the same purpose in divergent paths, and make costly sacrifices. Villeneuve reminds that sometimes the world is ugly, and in resolution our souls are in the balance. Jackman and Gyllenhaal are awesome. The cast is amazing. ""Prisoner"" is not a pleasant movie to watch--not at all. ""Prisoners"" has profound power."
"A movie that is, in my humble opinion, toeing the line between So-so and bad? What happened to audiences today? Have you all lost your minds? Is the government already succeeding at dumbing-down the masses? OK, sure, the performances were solid. But what I saw in the end was great talent wasted on an insanely contrived film.We all know what the story is about and the premise is rather primal, I must admit, encouraging me to see the film. But it was poorly written. POORLY. It started with the characters then snowballed down the hill to a contrivance cesspool where it drowned.I didn't like any of the characters, except for Alex, played by Paul Dano. The second character I empathized with was Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal), who almost went on my list of ""Idiots the world would be better off without,"" but he avoided it by really trying to find the girls and practically being tormented by Dover (Jackman), father of one of the girls abducted.Now Dover was one of the worst characters in the film, probably in movie history. He was written for us to connect to, whether we disagreed with his methods or not. But in the end, he was basically jeopardizing the investigation. His level of stupidity was dangerous, to himself and everyone around him. So, he may not be a thinking man. I could buy that. Then could he at least smarten up somewhere towards the end of the film? Where was his character arc, his moment of truth? Are we to assume he actually learned something as events unfolded? Never once did he admit his humility and humanity, and yield his control of events over to fate. It could've taken 5 seconds. But he didn't. I'm not going to give away too much, but he was angry and desperate until the end.Then you had Dover's band of douchebags, like the Birch's, who also lost their daughter and are seemingly close friends with the Dovers. They most likely shared stupid pills as well. There wasn't a single useful person in the film. Loki came close but he did things I couldn't imagine anyone with his expertise, who supposedly solved every crime or missing person case he ever worked (not clear as to the kind of detective he was), doing the things he did. Also, he rarely called for backup or assistance, and don't give me that malarkey about the town's underfunded police department. Did everyone have to be brain-dead and desperate like Dover? To answer the previous question, yes, they had to be this way otherwise things would have had to happen differently, and it could've ended badly like how things happen in real life sometimes. But, as a writer, when you intend on something happening one way to get the result you want, most likely a happy ending, then you have to have characters who can comply, even at their own detriment, and that's where contrivances find their home and breed.The film had way too many wasted moments. Most of it did nothing to move the story along. Some lines, like the ""solved every case"" line regarding Loki's illustrious career as a police officer, not only made me chuckle but they felt more like set pieces, like the blue lamp on Dover's end table. Other wasted elements in the film were like red herrings that only added the extra 30 minutes to the already long movie.Also, the antagonist's agenda was quite ridiculous, as most have been in recent Hollywood movies. They're now very roundabout and overly complicated, making them ridiculous, instead of more direct approaches. The bad guys are working way too hard to reach their ultimate goal. I thought the hard work was supposed to be reserved for the good guys. ""Rage against God""? Really? That makes as much sense as going through the trouble to control the money and assets of all the local billionaires, taking power away from the wealthy and giving it to the the persecuted, all to create anarchy just before blowing up the city, and making the town's wounded hero watch it all from some prison pit in nowhere land. Oh wait..."
"I will not go too deep into the movie, but this is a movie that should not take place, past the discovery of skilrex in his RV. The children would be found at his aunt's compound almost immediately; there is nothing she would be able to conceal in the face of a search warrant for missing persons. The story would end right there, as the children are found, and are reunited with their parents.They had to make detective loki the worst detective in the history of movie detectives in order to continue the story. Here are some more silly contrivances. -Loki drives at high speed, the child to the hospital, suffering severe vision problems after being shot in the head upon the discovery of the aunt's dead husband -skilrex and the wannabe snake guy are past abductees, obsessed with mazes.. but the backstory of mazes is not explained in any way, shape or form -skilrex is supposed to be mentally retarded? I've never met a mentally challenged person that acts like that.. why couldn't he just be autistic? -loki sees the dead pig head in the sink, but has the parents identify the clothes, leading to the parents believing their kids are dead, ahead of receiving the lab report on the blood -loki for some strange reason dismisses the B&E from the wannabe, despite there being an open window.. only later does he find clues left by wannabe .. I can't remember the rest, but there are moreIn any case the acting and atmosphere are pretty good, so if you ignore the gaping plot hole, you might enjoy it.. 5/10"
"I have never seen as many people walk out of a cinema as I did when I went to watch this - I would guess that a minimum of a third of the audience left!! It is ridiculously slow and about an hour too long. The drama is not drawn out at all and you just end up wishing that they'd get on with the storyline. Attempts to draw out the tension are basic and laughable, while the excellent cast are forced to use tortured facial expressions to give the film any semblance of feeling.Overall an incredibly disappointing experience. I was expecting to love this, I ended up wanting to follow everyone else out of the cinema. Ridiculously poor, given the promising subject and excellent cast."
"Very well directed, poorly written, badly cast, well filmed waste of time.Predictable, trite but pretty film with poor performances from all except Paul Dano who was absolutely brilliant.The narrative didn't go anywhere you couldn't predict and trod ground already well worn and muddy. Jackman seemed insincere, Maria Bello miscast and extremely annoying. Considering other features of the genre, Silence of the Lambs springs to mind and makes this look quite amateurish.A polished turd."
"I was amazed by this movie. Characters are powerful and emotional. My favourite is Gylenghall because I never saw him in such a way - nervous but calm, devoted to his job. Of course it seems that he doesn't have any personal life, and I think it is a little minus. Like I didn't believe some of Hugh Jackman character's actions at the end of the movie. Tha'ts why I give it 9 stars. The strongest part of the movie, why I will remember it - it's story. So twisted, puzzled and provoking emotions (anger, pity, sadness...). Although this movie falls into simple category of ""dissapeared children movies"", it is one of the best! The story ant acting makes it so."
