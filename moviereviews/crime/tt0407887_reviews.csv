"The Departed is one of the rare cases when the remake is better than the original.It's succeeds mainly because of Scorsese's vision and ability to bring this project to life. Scorsese works with his cast turning DiCaprio, Wahlberg, Nicholson into a perfect trio and turning this film into of the best of the 00s. Like most of Scorsese's film The Departed is very bloody and very violent but very entertaining in the process. Right from the opening line to the end credits The Departed shows of its style and keeps it consistent trough the 151-minute runtime. However, the 151-minute long runtime is the only thing preventing The Departed from being a masterpiece. At some moments in the film (not many) it gets somewhat annoying, but not annoying enough to make me lose interest. In other words, the strongest point of The Departed is also the weakest point. The Departed despite being a remake has enough charisma and energy to make it seem original. The Departed is a triumph of its own kind, it works its way up and hits on an emotional level.There is something everyone in The Departed whether you're a Scorsese fan or not but if you're familiar with his work this is a must see.Final Score: 9/10"
"When veteran director Martin Scorsese walked up to collect his Best Director Oscar in 2007 for his efforts with Hollywood remake The Departed, it felt like justice had finally been served.After many a miss (hello Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, The Aviator, Casino etc. etc.), cinema fans breathed a sigh of relief when they saw the long-standing master finally get his just rewards and while it's hard to argue against the fact that The Departed is unlikely to be Scorsese's best work, it's one of his most easily accessible and fun films that remains a joy to watch to this day.Utilizing a whip smart and darkly humorous script by scribe William Monahan, that adapted Asian mega-hit Infernal Affairs for English audiences and transported the action from Asia to the thick drawl of Boston, The Departed is one of the most successful reimagining's of all time thanks to the screenwriter, Scorsese's energetic and perfectly paced direction and a collection of stars who shine together in an all-round ensemble.Front and centre of the cat and mouse game that sees an undercover mob affiliate infiltrate the Boston police department while simultaneously a Boston police office infiltrates the local mob, is lead trio Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson, who all deliver seriously fun and switched on turns with fantastic help from the likes of Vera Farmiga, Mark Wahlberg (in an Oscar nominated supporting turn), Alec Baldwin and Ray Winstone.Scorsese struck it lucky with the casting of his 2006 film with both DiCaprio and Damon operating at the peak of their powers, while also snaring Nicholson before he fell into relative obscurity and it's a cinematic treat to see these performers eat up the rich and sassy dialogue and play off each other to great effect as the stories twisted and ever evolving plotline transforms.The Departed is one of those rarely found films that continually stays on the move, barely allowing you time to stop and take a moments respite as DiCaprio's undercover cop Billy Costigan, Damon's undercover mob mole Colin Sullivan and Nicholson's purple adorned crime boss Frank Costello go about their respective lives, with Scorsese's film becoming a thriller that genuinely keeps you on the edge of your seat, culminating in one of the most unforgettable and at the times unexpected endings, that recalls many a wide jawed reaction for those that caught this classic in cinemas (myself included).Final Say -It's not Scorsese's best film but its absolutely one of his most enjoyable. The Departed may not offer anything deep and meaningful but this seriously addictive thriller is the type of cinematic ride we should all enjoy that rightfully ended up becoming one of the most memorable films of the mid 2000's.4 Â½ rat impressions out of 5"
"First off, this is an American stylized remake of the Hong Kong hit, Infernal Affairs. I have to give credit to that, a good film. I have seen both Infernal Affairs and The Departed. I personally prefer The Departed, and I think because of one thing: Martin Scorsese. This is the master behind such greats as Taxi Diver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, and he's at it again. The film has an all star cast with Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, and Alec Baldwin.The Direction was amazing. (maybe one of the reasons why he won the Oscar for it) I loved how some of the scenes were shot and set up. Especially regarding the Chinatown, and police interrogation scenes, among many others. The film is perfectly set up with intense, suspense scenes while adding in amounts humor at times. It works really well. The script is top notch. (Also Oscar winning) Realistic strong dialogue from scene to scene.Another thing I liked more in The Departed, as opposed to Infernal Affairs, was the acting. DiCaprio really seemed to earn a lot of respect from this role. Here, he takes on the tough guy persona so well. Sure it was known he was a good actor from his Oscar nominated performances in What's Eating Gilbert Grape and The Aviator, but he really takes it to another level here. I can't see anyone else as the character, he fits so perfectly with it. Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg, being Massachusetts natives, also give solid performances, with their natural accents. Nicholson works well in his role, as well. Everyone was extremely solid and everything seemed so real.Set in Boston, The Departed takes in all the Boston like atmosphere. Beautifully shot scenes of the Massachusetts Golden Dome State Capital building is just one part of the landscape. The Dropkick Murphys song ""I'm Shipping up to Boston"" really fits, great use of songs. Scorsese usually works music into his films really well.""Cops or Criminals. When you're facing a loaded gun what's the difference?"" This quote really represents the film."" Matt Damon plays a state officer in the Police, working for the crime boss of the area, Frank Costello (Nicholson). While Damon's character can be described as a ""bad guy,"" he is really misunderstood. As a kid, he is sort of mentored into crime business by Costello while Costello becomes the father figure Damon's character never had. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a young guy, coming from a bad, crime ridden family. He's decides to become a police officer to get away from the crime life he's been surrounded by. Taking all this into account, Captain Queenen (Sheen) and Seargent Dignam (Wahlberg) decide to send DiCaprio's character undercover to find out more about the criminal underworld and Costello. With his family's crime record, he fit's perfectly into the situation. Now you have a highly ranked officer working for bad guy, and an undercover cop in the criminal underworld working for the State Police. From here it's an all out suspenseful thrill ride. Who's who? Who's working for who? Who can you trust? Paranoia threatens everyone. Lies. Betrayal. Sacrifice. How far will you take it? At the heart of this film is character development. We really feel for the characters. We feel like we know them. It's really amazing part of this story and film. Tremendous story telling here.This is one of the most entertaining and suspenseful crime/drama's I have seen in a while. While Infernal Affairs, came first, I think The Departed expands on it in so many ways. Really solid crime/drama. Check both out when you get a chance. It's really worth it. 9/10"
"Now I know that 'The Departed' is based off of the Hong Kong movie 'WuJianDao', but Scorsese really grabs hold of a great story and brings it to the American Screen. My father grew up in Boston and when we walked out of the theater he couldn't stop talking about how authentic the environment and attitude was. Then there's the acting in which the lead actors (Nicholson, DiCaprio, Damon) not only give stunningly entertaining performances, but you become engulfed in each one's perspective and dilemmas. The smaller roles that of (Baldwin, Walberg, Sheen) are supporting roles that remind me of Jesus Quintana from 'The Big Lebowski', by this I mean that their screen time is limited but they make lasting impressions that you cherish each and every scene they are in, Alec Baldwin especially. The story itself starts off with the basic intro of the players and the setting, but you'll find yourself slowing following each and every plot twist and rooting back and forth for the good guys and for the bad guys. If you're a Scorsese fan, which I am, I think you will appreciate this film. You can clearly see the Scorsese touch ranging from the cinematography and of course the music, it's great to hear ""Gimme Shelter"" again, but ""Comfortably Numb"" played in so well. It's another gangster flick from Scorsese, yet this one stands alone because feels so fresh and most would agree Scorsese does gangster films the best; so why not let him. Oscar worthy, the acting I certainly hope; this is DiCaprio's best role since 'The Aviator' which was his best role since 'Gangs of New York', am I seeing a pattern here. But my lasting impression wasn't concerned with the politics of the golden statue; my lasting impression was that I had sat through 2 and half hours of brilliant and especially entertaining storytelling. Thank you Mr. Scorsese."
"Please don't make negative comments like some of the aforementioned people have been doing if you haven't seen the film yet! I have seen it, at a press screening last week. Not only is it the best film of the year so far, it marks a return to form for Martin Scorsese, and ranks with the likes of GOODFELLAS as being one of the best in his canon of films.I'm a fan of the Hong Kong film, INFERNAL AFFAIRS, upon which this is based. While THE DEPARTED keeps the basic structure of the original, it is very much its own movie, so much so that the screenwriter, William Monahan, didn't even watch the original film while adapting its screenplay, thus enabling him to infuse the script with his, and Scorsese's, respective visions.All the actors are first-rate (yes, even Leo, for all you DiCaprio bashers out there), and turn in some of their best performances to date. THE DEPARTED is sure to garner a host of Oscar nods, if not wins, including (hopefully) Scorsese's long-overdue statuette for Best Director. Plus, with actors like Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin playing supporting roles, that says a lot about the quality of the film they signed up for! THE DEPARTED is tough stuff, not for the faint-of-heart. That said, it is a must-see for adult viewers who long for intelligent, gritty stories to grace our movie screens once again."
"He has made good musicals (New York, New York), surreal comedies (After Hours), satires (The King of Comedy) and biopics (The Aviator), but Martin Scorsese has never done better than the times he's dealt with life on the streets and gangsters. Mean Streets, Goodfellas and Casino (and, to some degree, Taxi Driver) are proof of that. It doesn't seem strange, then, that his finest film in over a decade (Goodfellas was released in 1990) sees him return to that familiar ground. With a few changes.The Departed, based on Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs (2002), is Scorsese's first gangster film not to feature Italian-American criminals. In fact, this film is set in Boston, where the Irish rule. One of these ""godfathers"" is Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), the man the State Police want the most. After years of investigation, they're finally getting close, thanks to undercover agent Billy Costigan (Leonardo Di Caprio). Because of his family (all Irish, all bad), becoming a member of Costello's crew isn't that difficult. Now all Costigan has to do is report to his superiors, Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Dignam (Mark Wahlberg), who will pass on the information to Ellerby's (Alec Baldwin) Special Investigations Unit. What they don't know is that Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), the most promising element of said unit, has been on Costello's payroll since he was 12. Soon enough, both cops and crooks become aware of the situation, beginning a manhunt that's gonna make the already fragile Billy even more nervous and Costello increasingly crazier.By moving from Hong Kong to Boston, Scorsese and screenwriter William Monahan have made the first step in ensuring this film will be quite different from its Chinese inspiration. Another significant factor is the running time: a mere 97 minutes for Infernal Affairs, 150 for The Departed. This is due to new characters (Dignam and Costello's henchman Mr French, played by Ray Winstone, were missing in the original) and subplots, such as the one concerning Madolyn (Vera Farmiga), a psychiatrist who gets emotionally involved with both of the moles. But the most crucial difference is in the depiction of the underworld: whereas IA was stylish without being excessive, Scorsese's vision comprises very colorful language (some insults are so creative one might expect Joe Pesci to show up) and, of course, buckets of blood, the last part of the movie proving to be particularly shocking. None of the scenes ever reach the gross-out level of Casino's head-in-the-vice scene, but in pure Scorsese tradition it remains unflinchingly violent (also notable is the music, perfectly setting the mood, scene after scene, alongside Thelma Schoonmaker's impeccable editing).Amidst these brutal surroundings, the director handles a spot-on cast: Baldwin, Sheen and Wahlberg (the latter finally back on form) make good use of their little screen time, Damon fine-tunes the edgier side he showed in The Talented Mr Ripley and the Bourne movies, and Nicholson, playing the villain again at last, delivers another OTT but classy turn (original choice Robert De Niro would probably have played the part with more calm and subtlety). A special mention is needed for Di Caprio: working with Scorsese for the third consecutive time, he has finally found a way to shake off his Titanic image, thanks to a vulnerable, gripping (and arguably career-best) performance.With its clever plot, excellent acting and expert direction, The Departed is without doubt the year's best film so far. If this really is going to be his last gangster film (he has said so), as well as his last studio-endorsed picture, Scorsese can be proud, given the masterpiece he has given us. If only they gave him the Oscar in return..."
"Just came back from watching the movie so it's still fresh in my mind. Overall the movie was good but it could have been shorter. Good movie but nothing extraordinary, not a master-piece, not a classic. In this period filled with really bad movies it's a movie you have to watch.Some things are better than in the original (Infernal Affairs) like character development. It is especially true for DiCaprio's character (not really for other character). However the scene, when Wahlberg cites all of DiCaprio's family connection to the mob, takes too much time. They take a long time establishing how DiCaprio sells drugs with his cousin and finally get into Nicholson's gang. However after that it doesn't take long for Nicholson to give his total trust (in one year and a half to two years), which bothered me. This takes the first hour of the movie and i think it could have been cut by at least 20min.Some scenes have a lot more impact in Infernal Affairs than in The Departed. I'm gonna cite 3 scenes which are some of the most important in the story in my opinion: -The death of Wong/Queenan: in IA, Wong falls suddenly, lands on a taxi cab taking Yan by surprise. When Yan realizes Wong is dead you can feel the suffering Yan goes through by the loss of the only person who knows he's a cop but also/mainly by the loss of his friend. In The Departed we see Sheen falls in slow-mo until he hits the ground in a splash of blood. There's absolutely no connection, no friendship between DiCaprio and Sheen. We see DiCaprio almost on the verge of crying. But Why ? He's not his friend and there's still Wahlberg to prove he's a cop.-The death of Sam/Costello: In IA, Ming seems to show a desire to redeem himself and become a good man for his girlfriend. When he confronts Sam in the parking lot during the raid, he kills Sam to remove any evidence he's a mole and restart on a blank slate.In The Departed, although Damon slightly mentions starting anew in another city, when he kills Costello he does it just to cover his a-s-s. Never after he seems like he might become good.-The elevator and final scene: In IA, the meeting on the rooftop is between two men on each side of the law but sharing so much in common. You can even sense that Ming has some respect for Yan. There's no violence until what happens in the elevator. When Yan dies you can see Ming didn't want this to end like that. Yan's death is really emotional, all sounds are drawn off and only an opera piece is playing. When the second mole gets killed by Ming you only hear gunshots.In The Departed The final scenes are a mess. Damon and DiCaprio just hate each other's gut, the token black guy shows up, the 2nd mole shows up and everybody executes everybody. They just stand there to get shot. The scene seems really rushed.And when Damon open his door at the end of the movie to see Wahlberg waiting for him, it was the cherry on top of the cake. Everybody was cracking up. How many shots to the head do we need to see ? Was it really necessary to kill Damon and provide the audience with a happy ending ? Although The Departed is a good movie I felt a lot more satisfied with Infernal Affairs. They have very different feel to them. One is over-the-top street violence while the other one is more subdued, concise and nuanced.For those who says that The Departed is way more psychological than IA I would have to disagree. Infernal Affairs shows how two men struggle to know what defines if they're good or bad. Is it their actions or their allegiance to one side or the other of the law? In the end they're really similar. Yan tells the Psy he's a cop and lift that weight off his shoulder even if it's for just a second. Ming wants to redeem himself and prove his girlfriend but also himself that he's not that bad. Others before me have also commented on the buddhist notion of eternal hell so I won't talk about it :) The Departed lacked in that department. There's no connection between the two main characters except for the fact they are moles. They're almost portrayed as black and white. Especially Damon who doesn't seem to have any nuance. He's just bad till the end.The Departed 8/10 Infernal Affairs 9/10"
"Before seeing this, I knew I was in for a treat, given that it's a Scorsese movie, but The Departed was even better than I expected.The acting is outstanding. Leonardo DiCaprio gives what is quite possibly the best performance of his career. Even the people who hate him admit he did a good job. It's turned some haters into fans and my brother who despises him even says he was great. Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson give their best performances since The Talented Mr. Ripley and As Good As It Gets. Mark Wahlberg almost steals the show with the best lines. Ray Winstone, Alec Baldwin, and Martin Sheen are good, too.Definitely one of the best films of the 00's. And easily one of the best remakes of all time. It's intense, funny, exciting, suspenseful, superbly acted, violent, has great characters, and has one of the most shocking scenes I've ever seen. And there's not a boring moment in it's two and a half hour running time. The film will most likely be nominated for picture, director and adapted screenplay, and in my opinion, it deserves all three of them. DiCaprio and Wahlberg also deserve nominations.See this as soon as you can."
"Excellent. A great, great movie. I saw it last night at a special screening and must say it was a tour de force. Even though Boston is not really a gritty town Scorsese was able to capture a darker side of the city. Coming from that area, I am always concerned when actors put on the local accent as it tends to be distracting rather than supportive. However, with local pros like Damon and Wahlberg they were able to really grab hold of it and not go overboard... most of the time. The true stand out performance has to go to DiCaprio. He has really come into his since hooking up with Scorsese, having scored a number of original performances all of which have expanded his range. He really snagged onto a deep and tragic character and created something that will hopefully be recognized come awards season. One of my favorite aspects was the friendly hostility the characters had for each other. It is a specific trademark that I have never noticed in any other city. In Boston, when you are really close with someone (or not really) it is, more or less, a requirement to bust their balls and shoot cruel insults back and forth in rhythmic banter. That detail was extensively realized in THE DEPARTED and I doubt anybody who was raised outside of the metro Boston area, or at least visited at some point, would find it nearly as hilarious as those who were. As for Scorsese's direction, I think he scored big with this one. While many have criticized that his movies have become more commercial I believe that he has just evolved. There were some classic Scorsese moments here, my favorite being a scene where DiCaprio is alone and packing his things in his apartment. Beautifully cut and stylistically directed. Is it his best effort? No. But it still is truly mesmerizing. He has created something truly special from a city that is highly underrated."
"Just watched it last night and can't help but think how much better the original ""Infernal Affairs"" was compare to ""The Departed."" The Departed had wasted its cast power, failed to fully develop the characters, failed to focus on the inner conflict for the two undercover, didn't make enough of a point in betrayal, and tried but failed to made up with Scorsess' trade mark violence and sex.I didn't feel the inner conflict of Matt Damon the same as Andy Lau. I couldn't help but feel for Jack when Matt betrayed him while I could understand Andy's inevitable turn and his trying to be a better person than he was.I couldn't feel for Leonardo. He was crying and breaking up after what? SIX MONTHs? Damn! Tony Leung was a undercover for nine years and he didn't sign up because he chose to, he signed up because that was the only way he could be a cop! Martin Sheen got shafted in his role. There was no time for his character to develop a believable relationship with Leonardo. His screen time was wasted. When he got pushed off the roof, Leonardo wasn't feeling the loss of his only life-line to the world, there was still Mark, he wasn't feeling the loss of a trusted friend, there was no friendship, he wasn't feeling the loss of a fatherly figure, and the only emotion he could have was the shock from the brutality of the murder.Mark Walhberg and Alec Baldwin got shafted, too. Mark Walhberg was reduced to a foul mouth asshole turned plot device. What do we need him for other than showing up at the end to put Matt out? Alec Baldwin? His whole highlight was to make that stupid speech about marriage at the golf course? COME ON! The only bright spot in this movie is Jack Nicholson. But even his talent is wasted because he had no one but ""Mr. French"" to play off his evilness. The classic scene of the original Infernal Affair had Jack's character to confront his counter part in the police station with some of the most memorable moment of the film. Jack has no counter part in ""The Departed"" and his brilliance was wasted. (The dock encounter was lousy with Martin Sheen making empty threats and Mark Walhberg just running his mouth off.) Matt Damon and Leonardo Dicaprio made lousy under covers, nowhere up to the professionalism showed in the original. Even the confrontation at the end lack the power of the original with the surprise. More dead bodies and more punches and elbows actually subtracted the suspense and the confrontation. There was nothing like the psychological confrontation with the calm manner in the original. Instead, we had elbows flying and a character cracking up crying. Mark Walhberg's existence actually ruined the helplessness of Leonardo. Unlike the original, logically he didn't have to do it alone.""The Departed"" is a good movie if only it wasn't a remake. There is a reason it is not doing well in Hong Kong. The original is much much better plot wise and character wise. The acting was superb in both movie but the script and the direction was the difference. Even though the plot was essentially the same, Infernal Affair was a much better movie.Watch the original if you haven't seen it, and see the difference in camera work and characters."
"Idiots often say this: ""Oh, yes, it's very good for Hollywood I suppose, but not a patch on the Uruguayan original."" Well smack me in the face and call me an idiot, 'cos the 2002 Hong Kong crime thriller Infernal Affairs (Mou gaan dou) is aeons better than the Scorsese-directed, all-star Hollywood remake.The original was 100 minutes long and so taught you could probably play it like banjo strings. Several of the scenes were filmed with such artistry that they set a new standard in beautifully realised intensity. The plotting was tight, the acting pitch-perfect, and you really felt for the protagonists.It was, in short, the best cops and robbers thriller anyone had seen in years.So of course it had to be remade.Enter Scorsese, Nicholson, DiCaprio, Damon, Sheen, Baldwin et al.What results is bloated competence.The set-pieces from Infernal Affairs remain, but are slacker and less well-handled. People in the cinema were laughing where they should have been clutching their heart to keep it in their chest.The precision camera-work gives way to run-of-the-mill shots. Consider the sloppy execution of the rooftop fall.The film is considerably longer without any real cause (bar, perhaps, Nicholson's hammy imperative to overplay any role he takes on). Witness the affair storyline, which is an unnecessary sop to the need for a more prominent female role, or the FBI addition, which is completely superfluous.The end result is simply a lot weaker than the tightly-budgeted, tightly-edited, subtler original.The only improvement Â and I shudder to say this Â is Alec Baldwin's role as the wise-cracking police captain, which made me chuckle on many occasions.Get the original out instead. Please. You won't regret it."
"The DepartedThe screenplay: Top NotchThe performances: all-star cast delivering all-star performancesThe music: perfectThe Directing: Martin Scorsese at his finest and that is saying something.Once again Scorsese delivers a film that meets or exceeds the expectations of its audience in nearly every way. There are moments of incredible tension, violence, and drama, moments where characters reveal their vulnerabilities and weakness. Comedic moments and moments of sadness and through it all a multi layered and brilliant story is told by an American film maker who once again proves Harvey Keitel correct when he said, ""Maybe he (Scorsese) got what he deserves--exclusion from the mediocre."" This film is Scorsese's finest work since Raging Bull, but it is not simply about Martin Scorsese or the amazing screen play by William Monahan, it is more than an amazing score, and great cinematography. While many of the accolades for this film belong to those behind the scenes people who envisioned and directed this film. One would be remiss to not point out the great performances of an all-star cast, many of whom deliver the finest performances of long and storied careers. Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon deliver incredible performances. However the performance that stood out for me was Wahlberg, Mark Wahlberg's Sgt. Dignam stole every scene he was in, and he shared screen time with each of the afore mentioned actors. He gets to deliver some of the best lines, and with every scene he leaves the audience wanting more, and anticipating his next scene.Since The Academy has had its collective heads stuck Â for so long, mentioning a Scorsese picture and Oscar in the same sentence seems to be a waste of time. That being said I can not say if he will finally win the Oscar that he has deserved for so long, as his major competition (Flags of our Fathers) has yet to be released, I will say that I expect to see Wahlberg nominated for best supporting, and Leo and Damon will be pitted against one another once more, this time for best actor, Monahan will be nominated for writing, and of course Scorsese will be nominated for director. Also, it goes without saying a best picture nomination will be in order for The Departed.That was the long version; the short version is if you like a movie with incredible performances, direction, music and visuals. If you like a layered story that is not formulaic, in short if you appreciate film making and story telling at its finest then see this film. Even with the glowing reviews of myself and others, and the high expectations they will undoubtedly bring I assure you that you will not be disappointed."
"Definitely the the type of movie that makes it worth going to the theater. Very intense action and violence, twisting plot, lot's of misdirection.The story line is a bit overly whelming at times, this isn't a good movie to watch if you're tired and follow the action, the double crosses and the sometimes confusing who's who of the movie, but if you can just remember the basic characters the minor twists won't be too confusing.While it's certainly not a love story, there is that element, with a bit of a morality play going the whole time.I can't make some of the statements I'd like to make because I really try to avoid spoilers in my reviews, but I'll say that I enjoyed the movie even though had I been in charge it may have ended differently...All that said, if you like a thriller that has some rough and tough violence and a plot with a few twists and turns this film would be one I'd recommend to you."
"Caught The Departed last night and I have to say, its one abject failure of a remake. I was expecting it to be good, and truth be told, I wanted it to be good because it is based on Hongkong's Infernal Affairs, quite possibly one of the best gang flicks of all time. It is one of my personal favorites due to its brilliantly conceived plot of gang versus police, replete with paranoia and deceit. It is also quite possibly, one of the most intelligent films I have ever seen (second to Memento).Where do I even begin? There are just so many things to criticize about. Firstly, the utterly realistic characters in Infernal Affairs have been reduced to one dimensional vectors that merely carry the plot forward. Matt Damon's character was reduced to a bad ass villain and was almost gleefully ridding anyone who knew of his identity, with no hint of remorse even till the very end. In Infernal Affairs however, at the end of the film, Andy Lau truly wanted to be a good guy but obviously, circumstances did not allow him to, and therefore he was forced to kill the gang boss to protect his identity. He subsequently went crazy over the guilt of killing the police informant (Tony Leung, or Leornado in Departed). Infernal Affairs ended brilliantly because Andy Lau's character survived it all with no one knowing his true identity. He could therefore assume his role of a high-ranking police officer, but was ridden with guilt and constantly reminded of the people who died because of him. It was really tragic and you could almost sympathize with his character. And what's with the ending of The Departed?!! Do all Hollywood films have to have perfect fairy tale endings where the bad guy has to die? And even if he has to die, does it have to conclude with an abrupt scene that lasts 30secs, and not to mention, totally cheesy and lame. It seems like a quick way out to conclude the story. The climax at the lift in the abandoned building was also unintentionally funny as body counts skyrocketed as people just started dying ridiculously. The reaction that people had in that scene in Infernal Affairs was true shockÂ'Oh my god!'. The reaction in Departed was quite the opposite Â people started laughing.Also, the strange and awkward friendship between the police informant's boss and the gang boss was completely removed in the Departed. It was so enjoyable watching how the 2 former friends who are currently on opposite ends of the law, try to outplay each other in a full-fledged war of wits and power, but with grace as a result of their friendship in the past. This was COMPLETELY omitted in the Hollywood version. And also, there was a lack of tension between the police force and the gangs. Martin Sheen seems almost weak and hapless against Jack Nicholson and Nicholson himself appears barely sinister and intelligent. Another stupid omission was the friendship between the police informant and his boss, which was meticulously staged in Infernal Affairs, and culminated in a tragic climax when the boss fell off the building and landed right in front of the informant. This scene was attempted in Departed but failed miserably when Leornado tried to look sad when his boss died. There was no friendship to speak of between these 2 characters in Departed!!!The movie also tries way too hard to entertain. The crazy antics of Jack Nicholson is reminiscent of his character in Anger Management. Yes, Anger management, that rubbish of a comedy. And I do not understand why there are so much sexual references in the movie. There is sex, women and porno everywhere in the movie and is completely unnecessary and downright insulting. Gritty realism is not achieved by dumping sex scenes in the movie.I can go on and on and criticizing about almost every single aspect in the movie (like how unnecessary the role of the psychiatrist in the Departed was, but completely pivotal in Infernal Affairs etc.), and might as well write a thesis on this movie. To conclude, there was not a single scene of tension nor was it ever moving or exciting. In fact, i found it more funny than anything else. The acting was not particularly great as well despite a rather stellar cast. Infernal Affairs was an intricate and convoluted plot of deceit, lies, friendship, paranoia and love, at the hands of skillful directors who carefully stage memorable scenes and powerful climaxes Â almost everything that Departed was not, despite an almost identical script. The critics are REALLY WRONG on this one. It is a complete failure of a remake, and even without comparison to the original Hongkong version, it is still a ridicule of an otherwise excellent plot. The editing was also fragmented and confusing, and coupled with horrendous pacing, the film gets progressively frustrating. Martin Scorsese has effectively removed everything that was so good about the original. Trust me, save your money and time, and watch Infernal Affairs, even if you have watched it already."
"Remake of Infernal Affairs is not the second coming of the gangster film that some proclaimed it. It is a very good, if decidedly over long tale of cops battling robbers with moles on each side trying to remain hidden.The plot is simple, a cop is sent undercover in the mob at the same time a crook works his way into the police force. Complicating matters is the fact that the bosses on both sides quickly realize that a rat is among and they begin the search to ferret out the mole.The original Infernal Affairs is one of the better Hong Kong Films of the last ten years. Its a well told tale with some nice stylish twists. If the original has any flaws its that the film falls in love with itself in the second half and becomes a bit too showoffy. Thats not the case here, here the story has been refashioned and rethought into a gritty tale of Irish cops and robbers in Boston. Its different enough to discourage comparisons, which is a good thing in these days of shot for shot remakes.Martin Scorsese has fashioned a really good film. The cast is mostly excellent, with only Jack Nicholson ruining things with an occasional lapse into stereotypical ""Jackisms"". Leonardo DiCaprio has at last arrived as an actor and turns in an excellent performance as the cop gone deep undercover. His performance is sure to garner an Oscar nomination.I really liked this film but I didn't love it. The film carries a sense of having been down this road before, not because its a remake, as I said it different enough to rebuke comparison, rather its because it takes the gangster films of the past thirty years and compresses them together and has a very familiar feel. It reminded me of several other films about the Irish mobs, State of Grace in particular, so it didn't strike me as ground breaking the way The Godfather or Goodfellas did upon first seeing them.My one real complaint with the film is that it takes too log to get where its going. Yes its tense and it keeps you on the edge of your seat but when it was over I felt as though I had been watching it for twice its length. A good movie should fly by and make you lose track of time. I was checking my watch through out much of the second half of this movie.Definitely worth seeing, but I'm not sure you're going to love it, so much as you're going to like it.7 out of 10."
"I beg you all, especially those who vote > 8, please view the trilogy of ""infernal Affair"" (Wu Jian Dao) from HK before doing any judgment on anyone in Departed.I personally favorite staff in the movie, Jack, Matt, Leo, Martin. I have to say all actors are the best, also, the script. Director, i am so disappointed.The story and even most charming details are borrowed from the original version(the first installation of the trilogy, if you are interested, the following two are also the most excellent movies in HK movie history), however, Martin turned me down finally.No discussion on the reasons why the two mouse come to be themselves, (it has been a long way why they ""departed""), please do not use only F-word to attract us, please don't regard everyone of us as fool. Matt is kind of no-brain to get all the info to Leo when they finally meet at the police office, and then became just a cold blood killer(still no-brain) to delete his files. is that make any sense, they looks like idiots there? Music is nice, but still a long way to the old one, which is much compatible to the atmosphere(which is also missing in this cut).And finally, the end is disappointed. where in the HK version, it is most exciting and moving 10 minutes during last 10 years. thanks!"
"OK, saw the movie actually 2 days ago, didn't get a chance to think about it. Now with a refreshed mind, here it goes:If one never saw the original ""Infernal Affairs"", you would fall in love with ""The Departed"" right away, after all it has an excellent plot. And with the legendary ""Gangs"" like Nicolson and Scorsese, we have every reason to have a high expectation. Unfortunately, this is not the case!The Bad: If I want to sum it up, I would say that was because of Scorsese's passion over brutal violence, it prevents him to reveal the true essence (as human beings) of the movie.1. I really feel sorry for Martin Sheen, his character in the movie is so pale, he does not show the deep and close relationship (as in the Infernal Affairs between Tony Leung and Anthony Wong), nor there was any sign shows he was even a capable cop. So unfortunately, I found myself hardly could feel sorry for what happened to him. Having said that,Infernal Affair's Anthony Wong did a superb job to catch the essence of his character. 2. OK, how about Mark Wahlberg's role? The obviously increased lines for him did not charm him a bit. With his boss being killed, and him as the only one knows about DiCaprio's true identity, he actually took a paid leave?! What's up with that? Does it even make a logically reasonable sense?! All right, he took his action in the end, butÂ3. Does it have to be a two and half hours movie? There are so many unnecessary scenes to my opinion. Just name a simple one here: when Matt Damon went in talking to the bad guy pretending he is the lawyer. PLEASE! We audience are no fool, you don't need to show everything to us, all you need to do is send Damon to the room and start talking. We would figure out the guy's lawyer did not show up. Well, there are so many in the movie, what I am trying to say is if Scorsese wants us to keep thinking about what happens and what will happen next, you ought to do a consistent job!4. The most of all, this movie pretty much follows what the Infernal Affairs had to offer, the biggest shock? The ENDING! I have to say I was confused right after I saw the movie, I thought maybe I was too dumb to figure out what it meant. BUT, the more I think about it, the more I got disappointed. The ending was so bad it can literally take all the credits it gets. Let's set Mr. Scorsese's beloved violence scenes aside, for me, I think the essence for the movie is: the ""good"" and the ""bad"" does not really have a clear line in between to judge from. Just like Nicolson said: ""When I was your age, they would say you could become cops or criminals. What I'm saying is this: When you're facing a loaded gun, what's the difference?"" For that reason, I gave two thumbs up for Infernal Affairs' ending, sorry Scorsese, yours is just too lame!Also, I am not buying the cell phone communication throughout the movie, personally, I think the Morse code is a much better way!The Good: 1. Nicolson! To be honest, he is a perfect fit for this character. The only other possible candidate I can think of is Robert De Niro. Nicolson actually did a great job as Frank Costello. My only problem is I could hardly see Costello's foxy side. 2. The Shrink! OK, I have to say that is one shining point of the movie! Not like the original one assigned two female roles to the two leading actors, ""The Departed"" combines as one, which not only makes the character more standing out, but also adds another interesting twist to the story."
"Well, due to all the hype I went to see this one with great expectations, although I must admit without having seen the parent film Infernal Affairs. What a let down ! Setting the scene is great, and time taken to achieve this is well spent, but for me the film started to drag, with expectation and patience well run out by the time the plot strands began coming together. Yes, Jack Nicholson is a great actor, but no he didn't convince me in the role, even though most of the good lines and deliveries were his. But Boston Irish ? Everyone, including the deliverer of the line ""I'm Irish & can live with something wrong the rest of my life...."" failed to convince me of Irish lineage. The accents, the faces, the attitudes were all wrong for souls in torment over doing what they believe they have to do, a basic for Irish/Catholic guilt and angst. The film would have been much stronger with unknowns in several key positions, and for me once the disparate strands were established the rest of the film was very predictable and I wasn't kept guessing - crucial if we are to suspend disbelief and have pressure and tension build in the viewer.DeCaprio fails to convince as a tough guy, despite the convincing scars. He stills comes across as an adolescent fuming after his pocket money's been withheld. Matt Damon looks like an awkward schoolboy, and was even less convincing than DeCaprio about being a cop. Mark Wahlberg sounded like he'd been taught to swear the week before, Martin Sheen was as hard bitten as a kitten and there were so many operational goofs the film became a comedy. A Federal agent running a State operation against his own informer? What a waste of time and budget monies. Only two people knowing about an undercover operation? BULL! Keep sending an undercover back after his nerve's gone ? Garbage ! Permanently deleting a full record (on a State Police computer no less!) without possibility of recovery ? Unbelievable - even children know data can be restored, and the system will keep a record of who deleted the information. For me, the film became a joke and I couldn't wait for the end to arrive so I could leave. By the time the end plays arrived and new players were falling like flies, the audience was laughing out loud at the inanity. Once again, Hollywood takes a good story and ruins it with poor crafting, no matter how well filmed. Very bad casting, a rushed and unfulfilling ending, far too much gore, not enough character substance, one dimensional players and an insult to the viewers intelligence."
"I had massive expectations for THE DEPARTED , a violent mob drama directed by Martin Scorsese the greatest film maker in the world today . After seeing it I did have a slight of feeling of something I have experienced throughout my life - Disappointment ***** SPOILERS ******The film starts in typical Scorsese style of a sweeping framing sequence with a musical soundtrack by The Rolling Stones similar to the work he did in GOODFELLAS . Unfortunately the director doesn't sustain this and whilst never becoming mediocre we don't see much in the way of what cinematic beauty Scorsese is capable of and in several scenes most notably in the death of Queennan the original film INFERNAL AFFAIRS did it far more better THE DEPARTED suffers from a very uneven screenplay courtesy of William Monahan . When it's bad it's woeful but when it's good it's great . It should be pointed out however that when it's good it's entirely down to Siu Fia Mak's original script and if you've seen INFERNAL AFFAIRS you'll notice how tight the storytelling was and how loose and cluttered Monahan's adaptation is in comparison . Did we really need a romantic subplot ? And there seems a lack of thought put into Costello . He's spent years as a crime boss so how come it appears it's only now that the Boston police department have come up with the bright idea of putting several moles into Costello's crew ? Are we to seriously believe that Costello is being protected for < Plot revelation that I won't give away > , and just because a tough gangster likes opera that doesn't make him multi layered , it just makes him clichÃ©d and unconvincing . Most ridiculous scene is where Costello meets his police mole in the cinema . If it's a clandestine meeting then why does Costello draw attention to himself by grunting and pulling out his penis ? Possibly the most stupid sequence I've ever seen in a Scorsese film There's been many other criticisms of this movie , a movie that seems to have split the critics right down the middle . One is the cast . I do think DiCaprio is a much better actor than what he's given credit for but I was never entirely convinced when he has to dish out violence . Someone a little less pretty should have been cast while you're left with the impression that Deniro and Pesci were first choices for Costello rather than Nicholson . Damon does merely okay as Sullivan while Ray Winstone as French is somewhat distracting because he's a widely regarded actor and household name in Britain and seeing him attempt an American accent is something of a shock to the system . The one performance I wasn't keen on was Mark Wahlberg as Dignam down to the fact he plays one of those fast talking foul mouthed cops that we've seen in far too many films and HBO series. Perhaps I'm being somewhat harsh to the cast in general and Wahlberg in particular because the dialog in Monahan's screenplay contains far too much swearing . Yeah I know swearing exists in real life but it's almost like it's included in every line just so the audience know that it's a hard hitting adult drama . I think everyone knew that when we saw the name Scorsese in the title . No need to over egg the pudding or include a fist fight every few minutes otherwise someone might think they're watching a Tarintino movie As for the good points ... well if you've liked most of this great auteur's movies then you'll certainly like THE DEPARTED , just not as much as you've liked Scorses's previous output . If you have loved most of Scorsese's films then you'll be slightly disappointed . It's not helped by the fact that this is the first movie directed by Scorsese to pick up the Oscar for best film where as master works like TAXI DRIVER , RAGING BULL and GOODFELLAS didn't"
"Make it long, add top star billing, and spend a zillion dollars, and I guess anything can receive an award. Silly me, I thought original, provocative, and at the very least, plausible story telling was needed for good drama.Let me start by adding, that ""great"" actors are useless when miss-cast. I'm sorry, but Damon and DiCaprio's persona's and looks are both too soft to play hard edge characters. Wahlberg and Sheen were so absent of realism, they compromised important plot dialog. Baldwin's attempt to add some comic flare came across as more buffoonery then wit. Even Nicholson's part was more cartoon then character. (Quintisential Jack)! Costello should have been cast by a hungry unknown, (from Boston).What makes this very pretentious movie really bad, are the ""holes"". This movie leaked like a sieve. Allow me to address a few:1) The premise alone. You have a large police department investigating a large crime family, yet only three members, (one of which is not even out of the academy), will alone without the resources of the department infiltrate an organized mob presumably using a mole. 2) If costigan is suppose to have been dismissed from the force, then why is he being seen by a civil service police psychiatrist. 3) If costigan was pulled out of the academy specifically for the benefit of his anonymity, then why does everyone he meets, know him and his family. 4) Does the department acknowledge the existence of costigan or not? His entire identity can not be conveniently eliminated from all record and then later resurface for a meritorious award. 5) If Costello was an F.B.I. informant, were the hell were the F.B.I., and better yet, what bigger fish would the F.B.I. want, then Costello himself. 6) Speakng of other agencies, were the hell were the Boston police during all these inner city homicides going on inside their jurisdiction.The ending alone was most pathetic due to the fact there was no feasible conclusion possible based on the story's lack of continuity. I don't mind the enigmatic challenge of a smart and sophisticated screenplay, but please don't mollify me with vapid subplots.Too much budget, and not enough substance. Unfortunately, I seem to find the latter in only foreign or independent films. Hollywood needs to to produce more movies that don't just rely on its marquee. Next time the director calls, ""That's a wrap"", there should be no loose ends.."
"I have loved the original (Infernal Affairs) from the first time it enthralled and enticed me into its engrossing story, and I have watched it so many times without ever losing a moments interest. When I found out it would be remade, I was annoyed at Hollywood for meddling with masterpieces, but then I heard it would be Marty at the helm. His films have always impressed me and he deserves an Oscar for his efforts, yet his recent offerings have left me feeling a bit underwhelmed. Take Gangs of New York, it was entertaining, it had all the right elements to make it a great film, but after watching it, I felt a bit robbed. Undoubtedably, the best thing was Daniel Day Lewis' 'Butcher' character, along with the fight scenes and the setting, yet none of it really ever gelled together to make that masterpiece Scorsese always craves.This brings me onto 'The Departed'. I went in thinking, this should be OK, Scorsese has taken an amazing concept and is trying to make it his own with a stellar cast that with such material, really shouldn't go wrong. I was right to an extent, but I was left with a feeling of dissatisfaction.Having read in reviews that Jack Nicholson stole the show, to be honest, he didn't really do much for me in the film, just his usual on screen persona (feisty, scary, loud). He fits the bill though, he took up the screen and he owned the scenes he was in. However, if you look at the original and compare it to Sam, you'll notice that Sam seemed more menacing, because you really didn't know what he was going to do or say next.Martin Sheens 'Quinan' was probably one of the weakest characters, his role in comparison to the original does not give a real mentor bonding with Billy Costigan (Leo Di Caprio) and defeats the idea of the closeness of the two main good characters. His sidekick however, Mark Wahlbergs 'Dignam', I think was the best thing in the movie. It allowed for a bit of banter and sparked off a few laughs in the cinema. He was more developed in this version, however he got in the way of Quinan making any impact on the story.The two leads were well cast, Leonardo Di Caprio does well with his role and looks frail but tough, and caught in the middle of things. Matt Damon had probably less to do, in acting terms, however he manages well with what he had. Having said this, neither of them match up to Tony Leung or Andy Lau, from the original.The one thing I did like about The Departed was the new idea that they both fall for the same woman. It added a bit more to the back story and suspense, towards the end. Overall, I gave this a 7, because it is a movie in its own right and being that, it is a pretty good offering by Scorsese. The problem is, for me, the original is far better. The whole concept, suspense and acting from Infernal Affairs is so much more believable and flowing. I think one important point to note is the environment, the Hong Kong police force and triads are much better suited for this plot, as well as the language. Scorsese did well with transferring the idea over to the S. Boston Irish 'mafia', but he failed in trying to translate a lot of the dialogue over from Cantonese (eg. the wrong way of writing the word 'bodyguard' on the envelope, changes to the misspelling of the word 'citizen').To conclude, if I was to take into account the original, I would have given this a 3.5/10, which may seem harsh, but I believe its nowhere near as good. If you haven't seen Infernal Affairs and were intending on seeing The Departed, I would advise you to see the latter first, so you will know what I mean about feeling unsatisfied. I think the rating of 8.7 (at the time of writing) for The Departed does not do the original justice. I leave it for you to decide."
"I was excited to see the movie because of the cast and the story. I was very disappointed after 5th minute because it is the same exact copy of the movie INFERNAL AFFAIRS '. The scenes, the story, everything is the same. I would understand if they used the story as a base and made a movie out of it but I will not accept it if the only thing they changed is the cast. I cannot make a good comment of the movie because it definitely is not a movie of it's own. There is no excitement of watching the movie because I know what would happen on every scene. I will give my vote to the actors only because their performance ( especially Leonardo Di Caprio )was very good but that's all."
"When I heard Scorsese made this movie, i was very excited. Because one thing that i know, Departed will be an adaptation of my favorite Hongkong movie ""Infernal Affairs"" or ""Wu Jian Dao"". And when I read a magazine, the director denied and said it's only inspired by. So my expectation flew away. But all my dream has gone when I saw ""Departed"". It's all the same. Sorry, spoiler, how the boss gang died, how the captain died, how the undercover died, all the same. In short, all the important scene, are all the same. Maybe, they have different ending but if you have seen ""Wu Jian Dao"", ""The Departed"" just only follower. No need a big name like Scorsese just to remake an Asian movie. One thing, ""The Departed"" has lost the thrill that ""Wu Jian Dao"" have."
"The title clearly refers to Scorsese's talent, which vanished in a squirt of stage blood about 15 years back. He wasn't talented, he was brilliant -- but that was then. Today he should be making intelligent independent movies, elder statesmanly flourishes of wit and humanity, inspiring a younger generation. Instead, he's humiliating himself with overblown junk. His love affair with hoodlums is tiresome, his critique of Catholicism is ignorant and stupid -- I mean, I dislike Catholicism as an institution, and God knows it doesn't need me to defend it -- but any sociological or spiritual phenomenon with the history and complexity of Catholicism deserves better treatment than the head-kickings Scorsese metes out. And ironically, Scorsese has made his own Faustian pact with the Devil -- he had his years in the Hollywood wilderness and feels he won't get anything thoughtful financed -- so it's better to team up with a bankable but untalented actor and produce these lumbering, brainless sub-epics.Many people in their comments here have struggled to express quite how deeply bad this film is. I too am at a loss. It's intriguing for a while, then downhill races into one of the worst supposedly classy films EVER MADE. Jack does his Jack Show, because he is vain and because no one has the guts to tell him that it was already self-parody 20 years ago. Supposed hard man Leonardo looks as enraged as a poodle when the canine beautician has gone a bit to close to his ear with the electric clippers. Matt is actually OK in the light comedy bits, which makes one wonder why he has become Hollywood's current Brooding One. Wahlburg -- rubbish. Sheen looks like he's focusing all his energies on trying to deliver his lines without spitting out his dentures. By the way, I reckon the script originally developed the sexual thing a bit more -- as it implies that Damon is not as groovy between the sheets as Leo, and his homophobia and other things seem to hint at his being a gay in denial -- but they decided that audiences wouldn't buy a gay hero, or it scared Damon, or God knows what -- just another loose end in this spaghetti-plate of a movie.Overall, hardly anyone in this movie (Winstone is an exception) act-ually ACTS. They are all oh so boringly themselves. Consider Olivier in Marathon Man, how his characterisation of an ageing Nazi suggested all sorts of undercurrents of twisted psychotic nastiness -- and then look at Nicholson's leering, over-the-top gurning. Chortling as you pull the trigger on someone is not really quite enough to convince us we are witnessing evil, Jackie baby.By the way, the film shows cutting-edge developments in cinematic blood-squirting technology. Instead of the wounds exploding using charges that produce a small cloud of smoke, they sort of vaporize -- it looks like it's done with compressed air. A great advance Scorsese can be proud of. This film has been larded with praise -- by gaga members of the Hollywood money machine. Every year people say Scorsese deserves an Oscar, and it's usually because we remember his early films. Well, they have Lifetime Achievement Oscars if we want to reward a body of work. Now he has to go to his grave knowing he got the Oscar for a Turkey. Only he probably doesn't know. And do any of the egos involved in this mess care? Hollywood cynicism, parodied in Scorsese's last film, The Aviator! What a joke.Right -- my last word, if you're still reading. We are currently being told by our masters to hate Iran. It has one of the few cinemas in the world that sometimes try to show something true about the human condition. Whereas our civilization produces, as one of the top-billing cultural manifestations of the year, expensive to make, heaped with praise and awards, exported around the world and seen by multiple millions--something about as edifying as watching lions tortured or Christians having limbs lopped off at the Roman Colisseum two millennia ago. What does this say about us?"
"They sure know how to make their version real 'American' with all the F words. That seriously was annoying, how every actor in the movie always needed to curse, I should have counted them.The original (Infernal Affairs/Mou gaan dou) is way better.Why? Cause the most important key was missing! In the original movie; the mole (Chan Wing Yan (as Tony Leung)) in the mafia gang had a great bond with the head guy of the entire case. He gave him a watch for his birthday. At that moment you could see how those two has a bond with each other. That would explain the grief that he showed in the movie when the head guy got killed.The American re-film: Billy and Queenan totally had NO connection in my eyes. All Dignam could do was bash him with the f words. Why the hell would Billy give a crap that Queenan died? They had no bond. I think supposedly in both movies the death of the head guy was the twist in the cases. The both moles (mafia side aswel the police side) realized this cannot continue anymore. Afterwards they had to take strong measurements to the case. That all cause of the death of that head guy.So yeah, I advice everybody to watch the original one first. I think this movie is too overrated. I sure hope they won't re-film part II and III of Infernal Affairs (it is possible you know...)."
"Why does Hollywood continue to believe that people in this day and time need to hear cursing in movies that goes way out of line. The entire script was centered around who could use the F word the most in one sentence. I believe that the writer must believe that in order to be a ""real"" man that you have to curse. The truth is that a person who has to curse to try and prove himself lacks the character and integrity to be a ""real"" man. Don't try and say that the characters in the movie are talking like cops in the real world do. I am a police officer and have been for over 35 years and have never heard anyone use the f word like it was used in this movie. The Massachusetts State Police hopefully are in a uproar over the way they are portrayed in this movie. It makes them look like a bunch of uneducated dunces that can only prove themselves to each other by cursing. Stay away from this movie."
"The way of Billy's infiltration to gang group was so foolish. What is more annoying more than this is the leader of gang group accepted Billy after a very short testing and took him in the main operational gangsters' group for no reason. 
Secondly Lazio mostly uses abusive language and the chief of Lazio expects the officers and most probably the audience to accept it. The language in his role was unnaturally showy.
Number of informants and the battle of different departments of enforcement agencies each other on these informants are so exaggerated. The gang leader even appeared as FBI informants at the end of the movie.ð It is the most silly part of the movie. 
In terms of players' acts and cinematography, the movie is outstanding and worth to watch."
"I wanted to love it, I wanted to be captivated, I wanted to be taken for a ride of action, mystery, and suspense. And well It was like ordering your favorite meal only to bite into it and find it sorta tasted like it was supposed to. You keep chewing trying to love it but it's just a bit off. That's this film.It plays out like a slick mystery novel - everything revolves around the narrative and everything happens to conveniently fit perfectly in place. While this isn't bad necessarily it comes at the expense of the characters being more interesting. Even with the all star cast line up it doesn't do much to give anything more than a cardboard cut out for the characters. How this won an academy award is certainly a wonder. Either the competition that year was terrible, or the judges simply looked at the names in the credit roll and felt like in order to keep their jobs they had to vote for it. The movie opens up laboriously slow trying to give you a background and history of the main characters, but what it fails to do is make you feel connected to the characters - it comes off slow and trite. It's just too forced and almost feels like a soap opera for the first 15-2 minutes.The major low in the film is when Billy somehow is supposed to fall in love with Madolyn and vice versa. The movie makes about as much effort to sell you on it as a bad porno. IE: Therapist girl gives one session with Billy, kicks him out. And then somehow a few scenes later they're knocking boots. It was just so terribly unrealistic or believable, but then again most other things in this film are. Now film works by the viewers suspending but this film just fails to really engage the viewer with the characters which would then allow you to suspend belief. So many things in this film come off as trite. Overall a watchable film but despite it's all star line up it's a very forgettable film."
"Lets start with a very slow intro to an amazing story. Then lets compile a dream cast of characters to act out this amazing story. So amazing in fact that it very well could be the best movie of the year. Then once this character had given up everything and risked his life in nearly every scene, lets FINALLY give him the opportunity to hand over the dirty cop and set things straight. Well, we don't have time to finish the story with a great ending, so lets just kill him. Then at the end, lets kill the dirty cop so he can be decorated as a hero instead of turning over evidence so he can be convicted. This could have been the best movie of the year, and the story could have been told in well under 2 hours. They should have just opened and closed with a firing squad and I could have been in and out in 10 minutes with the same results."
"Although I loathe a lot of what Hollywood does in films these days, I am willing to put up with much of it as long as the film pays off in the end. While there is much to admire in The Departed, the ending is one of the worst I have ever seen, below the standards even of Training Day and John Q. I was quite mesmerized up to the point where Costigan discovers the truth about Sullivan. In spite of Scorsese's compulsion/obsession with every filthy aspect of human nature, I was very much enjoying the performances and the story. Then, it seems he or the screenwriter had a brainfart. In light of that fact, all of the excess of the film caused it to implode. In the ensuing vacuum, I could find no redeeming quality of the film at all. What does the story tell us? It wasn't true to itself at all. No one gained a thing. No redemption. No resolution.I am not an expert on films in any way. But it seems to me that when a story is developed on the strength of a collection of main characters, the story had better wind up focusing on the relationship between them. One by one, the supporting cast is eliminated. Then one of the three main characters is killed off. That leaves the two lead roles, and as far as I'm concerned, at this point it has to come down to the two of them. Whether it's a showdown or a meltdown, this film had to close with Costigan and Sullivan forcing the outcome. Instead, they are both eliminated with as little drama as if they were innocent bystanders. The fact that these events left as many questions as answers tells me that the director really didn't know what he wanted the story to say.The acting was superb, the story captivating, the suspense almost unbearable - what more could you want from a good movie? Well, as far as I'm concerned, without a good ending, all of the above amounts to little more than the hype that usually precedes a film, but in this case makes up the bulk of the film. Enough with the blood and guts, Mr. Scorsese, enough with the profanity and vulgarity - lets see if you can make a film that succeeds on its own merits.And in the meanwhile, I would appreciate it if you could convince the studio to refund my money."
"This film is overrated. I enjoyed watching it and expect it will sell well, but being quickly included in the top 250 is more a factor of American ignorance than film genius.This film is mainstream. I don't remember any long shots or groundbreaking lines. Instead, the Departed feeds the lack of attention and mainstream spit talk of a cookie cutter sellout.This film is unoriginal. Do you seriously feel that this film develops characters properly? Do you think that the twists were unexpected because you were raised on Disney entertainment. Did you forget the unbuilt grey area regarding the CIA informer?"
"I got to see a sneak preview of it, and I must say: the BEST film of the year so far. Scorcese is at his best and truly deserves his anticipated first Oscar for this film. Also notable are the performances of Matt Damon (such a great ""bad-guy;"" he really must do stuff like this more often), Leo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson (as always), and Mark Wahlberg (best since Rockstar). However, some in the theater with me who had seen Infernal Affairs did say that Departed did not live up to the original. I have yet to see Affairs, but I honestly believe that Departed was pulled off well enough to really bring in some respectable awards in the upcoming season."
"i am a huge fan of 'Infernal Affairs' when i heard that Hollywood were remaking it, i was a bit sceptical about it, then i heard it was being directed by Scorses i was excited.i sat there for the first half hour or so, thinking the original got this part over and done with in about 10 mins. The Departed just didn't have the suspense or the character development of the original. When Sheen died, you just didn't feel anything for him, and the shock factor that the original had was just not there.the character development in the original was great, as you genuinely felt for the characters went hey died, but in the departed it was like so what if you die. The ending of the departed was a bit of a joke, it was just too much, i think Scorses just thought 'i don't want to make a sequel or a prequel to this movie' - (didn't want to make another goodfellas).to those who say Scorses deserves best director or that the departed deserve best movie, must be kidding me. Infernal affairs didn't even get nominated for best foreign language movie. When it is certainly a cut above the Hollywood remake. I'm sure they'll be nominated but to win, i don't think so.however on the plus side, DiCaprio has probably produced his best work since 'Whats eating gilbert grape', and is certainly in with a shout for best actor.the movie alone is a gd movie, but compared to the original its just another unfulfilled remake So if you have only watched the departed, go and rent out/ watch on film four the original and then re-write your review because I'm sure it will be very different."
"I thought the original movie of it ""The Infernal Affairs"" was more entertaining than ""The Departed"". The Infernal Affairs had more actions and more emotional than The Departed. It was total copy cat of the Infernal Affairs. When Leonardo DiCaprio was trying to beat Matt Damon on the top of the building was lame. With the Infernal Affairs was awesome. Tony Leung(Leonardo) pointed his gun at Andy(Matt) and said, ""Sorry, I'm a police officer."" Later Andy killed Tony in the elevator that was great action. Unlike The Departed was really retarded. For the Infernal Affairs it's a 10/10! There is one thing that was good about The Departed was that there was Leonardo DiCaprio. He acted extremely well. Matt Damon doesn't know how to act. They should of had Brad Pitt instead. The performance would be more outstanding. They got lots of cheap actors for The Departed. For the Infernal Affairs, they got a lot of expensive actors. GO INFERNAL AFFAIRS!!!"
"I love Scorcese, but, eh, this is the guy who also shot Gangs of New York of ridiculous fame. And this... piece of work is worst. Don't get me wrong, I liked a lot the first half hour of the movie. Even Nicholson is ""good"" and doesn't overplay his part in the beginning. Quite a miracle in itself for this decade! But then... where goes the plot? By the ending you get some unlikely situations that should have been ""preserved"" for the Da Vinci Code Crap: ""So, he is the traitor? Well, I'm not going to tell anyone, I will send him a CD with a recording I don't have yet and I will bring him on the top of a building to... huh... to use the lift with to get to floor level and I... huh... will call my old academy friend... huh... to... huh... ask him to come so the 3 of us can use the lift! Yeah! Good idea! And we will shoot everybody, and I won't tell the police, and I won't tell the only officer who knows who I really am. Genius!"" NONSENSE! The last 45 minutes are full of pretentious unbelievable ""so called smart ideas"". Try the original ""Infernal Affairs"". Even if it's not much glamorous, it definitely has ""something"". PS: and, BTW, don't you Damon is bland in this film?"
"what a let down, after all the fuss and rave reviews, the film is not a patch on the honk kong original. scorcese takes two and half hours to tell a very simple story that in the original had you tensed up all the way. here what we get is banal dialogue,(goodfellas again) implausible plot turns, (i'm trying to remember if infernal affairs plot was as ludicrous, take the fact that di caprio goes to see the police shrink, in the police building, what no ones sees him. the basic premise and point of the movie is when and how they are going to discover,each, it takes ages to get to this point, by which time i was bored silly with nicholsons way over the top performance, di caprio looked and sounded like he was about to cry any moment, but worst of all was that the film had no energy, it just sagged, this is now the third film from sorcese that looks tired, it started with gangs of new york, then aviator and now this, by this going, his next film will positively crawl to the end. overrated, overblown and forgetfull"
"Before starting I must confess to watching this film never having seen the original and without realizing there was one. After reading some of the comments here I will pick up internal affairs and watch it. Having discovered the film is a remake of a superior foreign film this explains a lot (though probably not all) of what makes this such a bad film.But I am happy to take the film stand alone on its own merits, of which there are few. For Scorsese to stoop to this debacle after masterpieces like Mean Streets and Goodfellas is shocking. The fact that this won so many awards is beyond me.Let's review the completely unbelievable plot points: - Gangster Nicholson allows former cop (who he knows is a former cop) DiCaprio become his right hand man seemingly moments after joining his gang.Nicholson discovers there is a mole in the organization. And can't work out that it's DiCaprio, his latest recruit. Ludicrous. This appears to be a gang of less than ten people. Give me a break.The whole film falls apart right there - if you can't believe the main premise then it's failed. But let's go on.DiCaprio is the only gangster not to give his ID number to his boss, but he is still above suspicion.Rotten Cop Damon gets away with blasting his boss Nicholson - and there is no investigation? Nobody ever subpoenas cell phone records (a very easy thing to do) Damon and DiCaprio just happen to be dating the same girl.Said girl is given incriminating tape of Damon by DiCaprio. Nothing is ever done with this tape though. Was this cut out to trim the film under three hours? Said girl agrees to go for a coffee with her patient DiCaprio. This doesn't happen in real life. Psychiatrists do not date their patients. Not even Frasier did that and that was supposed to be comedy.Police records are completely erasable by one person with no backup and no trace remaining. Nonsense.The final scenes at the building are ludicrous. Characters only briefly touched upon at the beginning of the film are suddenly players in the big game to the point where they will commit cop murders. I'm not sure I understood why it needed to be on the roof anyway. From what I understand this was in the original film but there was a reason for it. Poorly executed.Jack Nicholson is Boston Irish. Maybe he is of Irish descent in reality - but he sure can't play it well.Err, the State Police in central Boston? No - that's BPD's turf. They at least have to work with BPD.Gangsters throw a captain of the State Police off a building and there are no fingerprints or other evidence available later.And now for the pointless time wasters: Obviously Scorsese is big enough and powerful enough that he can dictate cuts (or lack thereof) to the studio at this point. Unfortunately this leads to a self indulgent two and a half hour (felt like four hours) film and convoluted story telling The whole plot with the girl psychiatrist. What is this for? It serves absolutely *no* purpose in the film other than to make it longer and less believable. Even her pregnancy is left hanging. I really get the feeling they filmed a lot more but had to quickly cut to get the length down. This is why studios have editors. Let them do their jobs and cut the drivel from films and make them entertaining.The whole setup in police academy. That's half an hour right there that should have been cut out of the film.The stupid porno/hooker stuff with Nicholson. Pointless, plot irrelevant and simply unnecessary. Goodfellas managed to be a great film without that. Although there was one light moment when Jack implied he can't raise the titanic any more. Art imitates life I guess.The OTT language. I'll believe it from gangsters but special investigators tend to be a bit more pro.The sex scene was just sillyNow let's throw in some bad casting/bad directing decisions: - Having Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio play the leading roles, both cops with crew cuts. They are both good actors but something should have been done to differentiate between the two in terms of physical appearance. These guys look too much alike in the opening sequences - waaay to confusing. This is solved later when DiCaprio starts to look more ragged.Whatever happened to the FBI angle? Why bother with it if it is unused? Too many stars. They all demand face time which makes the film drag. It would have been better with some unknowns.The whole secret cell phone deal was used how many times? Repetition plagued this film all the way through.OK - so you get it. The film has a plot full of holes and drags on for hours. It promises so much and delivers so little, which is why it deserves so few marks from me.The one star, if I must give one, is for Alec Baldwin who is hilarious as one of the senior cops and steals every scene he is in. In a cast of stars that's a pretty neat trick."
"I wasn't surprised when it won. The ""oh, he/she has never won, so we've got to give it to he/she"" has been VERY busy the last few years. Plus, I hadn't seen it. I was really looking forward to it. WOW!! This was bad in a number of ways, but mainly because this has to be the worst screenplay EVER to win any Oscar, never mind a best pic. How else was it bad? Casting Nicholson as a tough guy that would scare everyone else has always been a laugh. Nicholson is a little pisant. He wouldn't last a year in South Boston, never mind decades. Nicholson's games with hookers were pointless and just distracting. The woman shrink, whatever her name was, sleeping with both Damon and DiCaprio was ridiculous. Wahlberg (was that him? I hadn't known he was in the pic, and for a few minutes I thought Damon was playing two characters.), looked and sounded like a local village idiot in Charlestown. Truly, the entire police force, local, state and FBI couldn't have lit a 100 watt bulb. The idea that Nicholson's character wouldn't have fingered and killed DiCaprio's character quickly is also ridiculous. Let's see. Nicholson has, oh, a half-dozen henchmen, all of whom have been with him for YEARS, all of whom have KILLED for him. Then DiCaprio shows up. He is an EX-COP! Hicholson takes him in. About a year later, it becomes clear there is a rat in the group. Gee, who do we suspect? Now here is one that gets a little tricky. I noticed the guy told DiCaprio to go to #314 instead of #344. The guy noticed that DiCaprio still showed up at #344. Now, we aren't sure if that guy was an undercover cop or not. The TV said he was. Nicholson doubted it. If the guy wasn't a rat, why didn't he tell his cohorts that DiCaprio was, ahem, suspicious. Gee you think?Another reason it is so ridiculous he hadn't killed DiCaprio by then. When the TV fingers one of his guys as a rat, Nicholson won't believe it, though he knows there is one. This is like a ""which one doesn't belong in this group"" game for a 2 year old, but Nicholson failed it!There were a few more crazy plot holes and foolish setups. It was hard to keep up with them. As for the almost everybody-gets-shot-in-the-head ending, don't get me started. There are too many inanities there to begin. At least Wahlberg's village idiot knows how to put on foot covers. Was that to hide the fact that he didn't know how to tie his shoes?All in all, I understand why MS got the Oscar. The direction and acting was pretty good. But, giving this a Best Pic or voting it anything over a 6 is ridiculous."
"Oh my God.I can say without overstatement that I just saw the most gripping and entertaining American film to come out in at least the past ten years.I was lucky enough to get a pass to an advance screening of The Departed this past weekend in Boston. I wasn't sure what to expect and actually planned on being a little disappointed with all the expectations and hype of such an all-star cast.From the moment the opening credits came up, the movie grabbed me by the neck, ripped me out of my seat and didn't let go until the final scene.Each performance is more masterful than the next. Damon was a tour de force as the lead, tapping every ounce of his acting reservoir for this role. Nicholson creates another classic role to add to his already sterling resume. His mob boss would almost steal every scene he was in, if it not for every other actor being so fantastic However, the biggest surprise for me personally came from Leonardo DeCaprio.Having never warmed up to any of his roles or movies, I found myself blown away by him in this. I'm not sure if it was the material he was given, or if DeCaprio has grown this much as an actor, or a combination of both, but he finally won me over with his role in this instant Scorsese classic. Every character is pitch perfect, every scene is right on the money. The plot builds to a crescendo of such dynamic proportions rarely seen on film. I don't want to give too much away, but I'm still shaken from the ride I was taken on.People go to the movies in the hopes that maybe once in a hundred times you get to experience storytelling so masterful and transcendent that it changes the way you view cinema. This is one of those spectacularly perfect times.Forget Taxi Driver. Forget Raging Bull. Forget Goodfellas. As much as I LOVE those movies and as much as they have affected me in my lifetime, The Departed will hands down be Martin Scorsese's Master Work."
"Dare I? Dare I say it? This movie is better than Goodfellas. There, I said it.I saw this latest Scorsese film at an advance screening. Needless to say I was expecting a lot Â more than I thought this director (of classics like Taxi Driver but lately of Gangs of New York) would deliver. I was very wrong.Though the exact plot is unimportant, The Departed is about the blurred lines that distinguish good guy from bad guy, and cop from robber, in present-day Boston. With a packed cast (which I need not mention) that includes great supporting roles by Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin, the acting in the departed is stellar. Living-legend Jack Nicholson flawlessly delivers one of his best performances in years as the execrable mob boss Frank Costello. Nicholson's nuanced acting was so on-point that at times I felt like I was actually about to be shot by the slimy capo.The Departed is nothing short of spectacular. Funnier that most comedies, Scorsese is still able to amplify the bloodshed and meticulously deliver a stunning cinematic achievement.Bravo, Mr. Scorsese; you have outdone yourself."
"I went to see this film yesterday after reading all the wonderful comments along with some slightly bitter comments from people that have watched Infernal Affairs and were not entirely happy with Scorsese's take on the Hong Kong original.The first comment I would like to make is that I saw the original Infernal Affairs a week ago meaning that it is still fresh in my memory. That film was a very complex thriller that got straight to the point. The Departed on the other hand focuses on story telling and whilst staying faithful to the original, it becomes its own film.Scorsese has taken a great film and turned it into a masterpiece with breathtaking violence and superb character development. If fans were expecting a shot-for-shot remake, they obviously don't understand why Scorsese is regarded as one of the best directors of all time.The acting of all the leads were legendary and they all looked very comfortable in their roles. Anyone out there who previously disregarded Leo DiCaprio as an actor will be totally converted as he delivered an astounding performance and showed a gritty side to his character. In fact, he was so good that Mr Nicholson didn't act him off the screen when they shared screen time together. Accolade also has to be heaped on Damon also as he came into his own as the sneaky but smooth rouge cop. Add Sheen, Whalberg, Baldwin and Winstone to the mix and you have the best cast assembled for a motion picture this year.Offcourse no film is perfect (Although this comes close) but the only disappointing aspect of the film will be from the perspective of those that have seen the original. I am ultimately referring to the ending. Whilst anyone seeing this film for the first time will most probably embrace the climax, anyone that has seen the original will know what I mean.That aside, this movie has marked its place alongside such classics as Goodfellas, Raging Bull and Scarface."
"Director Martin Scorsese's ""The Departed"", a gangster flick based from the Hong Kong thriller ""Internal Affairs"", goes without saying as perhaps his best work since ""Goodfellas."" Working on a genre that's right up his territory, Scorsese is back on top of his game and recreates a new dimension to the genre. This crime thriller treads the same theme as much of its director's previous films does. It's about two young men, the people around them, and the complications brought about by their characters' ambiguity.Set in Boston, the Massachusetts State Police sends young cop Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) to go undercover and infiltrate an Irish mob syndicate where he quickly earns the trust of leader Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Meanwhile, Costello's informant Collin Sullivan (Matt Damon) works for the police department's Special Investigation Unit. Soon, stakes are raised when both the police and the mob realize there's a traitor among them, and that both Billy and Collin are both in danger of losing their cover and even their lives.Nicholson, yet again playing another villain, owns every scene he's in with his portrayal of Costello, providing a paradoxical attraction to his menacing character. DiCaprio, increasingly maturing as an actor since becoming Scorsese's ""muse"", fits right in as the streetwise cop, while Damon brings his usual authoritatively calm demeanor to the part. They are complemented by the ensemble performances of Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg and Vera Farmiga.Scriptwriter William Monahan (""Kingdom of Heaven"") retains much of the structure of ""Internal Affairs"" but adds depth to its characters and an acerbic quality to its witty dialog. The cinematography by Michael Ballhaus is brooding and morbid, capturing the character of its Boston setting while Howard Shore's score is as good as a soundtrack can be.At its core, ""The Departed"" is a well-crafted, well-written, and well-acted film noir. In an age where style usually triumphs over the narrative quality, ""The Departed"" is one of the best films I have seen so far in recent memory."
"this movie is completely inferior to Infernal Affairs on just about every level possibleIA anticipated an audience with a brain cell or two, and so explains during the title sequence what it takes this remake around 30 minutes or more to explain. repeat, during the *title sequence* we are given all of the information we need to know about the informant plants (which btw were realistically placed some considerable time in the past, rather than several months ago) and are then straight into the moviescorsese takes this fabulous material and then dumbs it down to spoon feed it to a western audience. all of the sharp and intelligent dialogue of the original is gone in favour of your usual Hollywood 4 word expletives. every other word in this film is an F word, and they are mostly totally unnecessary. all of the stylish camera work of the original is lost, for example the ultra cool roof top meets. and to top it the casting and performances are dry and badnicholson gives us a performance which is no more than good old bottled vintage jack. here's jack doing an impression of a rat etc etc, yawn.di caprio is good as usual but still doesn't nail the performance mostly because he doesn't physically suit the part. he just doesn't look tough enough for the challenge (as presented in the departed)wahlberg on the other hand tough's it up to the Nth degree, and is just absolutely atrocious. this man is working in a high level intelligence department and he plays it like a street cop. it's a totally inappropriate display and really reveals his limitations as an actormatt damon is just too plain, he is just totally unmemorable in this moviefor a director who used to be at the cutting edge of cinema, this is a fat and lazy remake of a lean and mean original movie/trilogy which i urge you strongly to see. time for scorsese to hit the gym and go back to basicsfor people unaware of the original i'm sure they'll be blown away by the incredibly intricate plot in scorsese's departed. unfortunately what they probably won't know is that this is a dumb rehash of Infernal Affairs"
"Trust me! Once you see the Hong Kong original, you would find out that Scorsese ruined this terrific play!The original title in Chinese was ""Wu-chien-dao"", which in Buhdism it means the bottom level of the hell. In this hell, people are doomed for eternity and suffer forever. And in the original, Costigan killed the other guy Costello sent into the force and the movie ends. Costigan has to bear the quilt and live on! This is what the script wants to show! Living but with the quilt is THE true hell after all! The new ending totally ruined the essence of the script underneath. What a waste!"
"Now now, before you go and comment, dislike and lambast my opinion, hear me out. This is by no means a bad film, in fact it's better than good. Yet, a ludicrous amount of film aficionados deem this as one the best films from the last decade. I'm afraid I strongly disagree. An amateur Boston cop infiltrates an American Irish gang by following the chief mobster. On the flipside, a criminal from the gang infiltrates the police department and reports the status of the investigation back to the head honcho. It's a vintage crime story that thematically conveys the power of trust. Scorsese is back to what he does best, crafting intricate mafia crime thrillers fuelled by rich character development. The arcs of the leading individuals are fully realised and are played out like a methodical game of chess. Motives are shrouded in mystery, minds are tainted by corrupted ideologies. Scorsese brings in an A-list cast comprising of Damon, DiCaprio and the ever reliable Nicholson who essentially chews up every scene like he is devouring a piece of tender chicken. Monahan's screenplay consistently brings out the gritty Boston upbringing of these characters. It's a harsh environment that lures you into this convoluted world filled with rats and tyranny. Wahlberg's sarcastic banter was a much required element to what is a tough exterior. My reasoning for not rating this excruciatingly high is the narrative structure. There are no surprises in this, it's a ""thriller"" that doesn't excite me. Purposefully indicating who the informants are in both parties at the beginning means a large duration of the film becomes predictably unexciting. It's only at its conclusion that it mistakingly tries to be enthralling by shooting people in the head (literally!). Lazily underwhelming, especially after 140 minutes of character development. The Boston accents also came across extremely heavily from certain actors, particularly Farmiga as she exclaims ""harrrrrdest!"". A well constructed crime drama that unfortunately is weighted down by a mechanical narrative."
"I'm never going to be in a position to win an Oscar, so maybe I just don't understand how goshdarn fab it is to get one. Still, were I Martin Scorsese, I can't imagine not being too ashamed to show my face in public after receiving an Oscar for this claptrap. This isn't a Martin Scorsese film; this is a Saturday Night Live sendup of a Martin Scorsese film. This is the Academy saying, ""Well, we didn't give him one for Gangs of New York or for Good Fellas, and he's getting a little long in the tooth, after all. We'd better give him an Oscar for this before he croaks."" Is there anyone -- ANYONE??? -- in this film, with the possible exception of DiCaprio, who isn't acting following a major dose of Xanax? (Matt Damon evidently took his Xanax after a lobotomy that was so botched that he could no longer even change his facial expression.) And what's with Mark Wahlberg's HAIR??? Is there any redeeming social value in scene after scene (after scene) of heads exploding in a red cloud? Even Scorsese is bored with depicting violence; he does it because it's expected of him, not because he really gives a damn anymore. You're stupid enough to want it; he's jaded enough to give it to you. A plot line with more holes in it than the hull of The Titanic. Characters about as appealing as Jeffrey Dahmer. You can't care what happens to a single person in this film, and you can't even care that the moral center collapses about an hour in. This film isn't even sickening; it's just dull, dull-witted, and trashy. Scorsese got his Oscar out of sympathy; too bad the film doesn't have any for the viewer."
"The war between the police and the organised crime in Boston has reached new heights. Both Oliver Queenan and target #1 Frank Costello have placed a mole into each other's organisations. Billy Costigan is selected to infiltrate Costello's ranks thanks to a family background of criminals and working men, meanwhile Colin Sullivan has been groomed since youth to come up inside the ranks of the BPD. As Costigan makes progress it becomes clear to his police superiors that they too have a rat feeding information outwards. With only Frank knowing Sullivan's identity and Queenan and Dignam knowing Costigan's, a race begins with the first one to expose the other winning.Having enjoyed the original film, I was quite looking forward to this film and not really worried that Hollywood would mess it up. In a way it does deliver but it is hard to ignore the problems and failings in the film and if I didn't realise how IMDb put together their top 250 list, I would be amazed that the film is running so high up it. The original was a tight cop thriller which I remember thinking owed much to American cinema in style and tone, so surely America can only do it better? Well, if not better then this is certainly bigger, with stars oozing out of every pore, a big director and a long running time. In regards the latter, the film should be commended for moving slickly through the 150 minutes and not feeling as long as it is. The fact that it is cool, engaging and quite exciting will be enough for most audiences and indeed the sheer volume of positive votes on this site shows it has struck something of a chord, but this is not to say it is a classic and those putting it alongside Goodfellas are simply out of their trees.The script here tries to give more room for growth to the characters, to explore their feelings outside of the tension and fear of their situation. Unfortunately this produces many scenes that are a bit dull and unconvincing as they attempt to deepen the material. Specifically I am talking about the thread involving the girlfriend, her scenes add little and the dialogue in the session scenes is obvious and, as a Sopranos viewer, I was surprised by this. A secondary downside of this (although not totally to blame) is that it is not as gripping and claustrophobic as I would have liked. Yes it is thrilling at times but I wanted it to be consistent like a real cat'n'mouse game with the noose tightening palatably around each character's neck as they raced to hang the other first. The ending is also a little less effective than it should be because, added to the original's strong ending is an extra scene that doesn't have a strong foundation and is not as good as it should have been.Ironically for such a starry affair, some of the performances are a bit weak, and I'm thinking specifically of Damon. He never seems like the flipped version of Costigan and I never really got the feeling of him being trapped, panicked and hunted in the same way as his opposite number was. Conversely then DiCaprio is pretty strong and is convincing as he loses himself into Costello's gang of murderers. He works well alongside a scene-stealing Nicholson. At times he threatens to completely tip over into ham but for the most part he is just larger than life and provides a lot of energy to the film. This energy is harnessed well by director Scorsese who directs with this usual eye for a setup and also an enjoyable soundtrack. The use of sudden stops in the music and quick cuts is perhaps a bit much to get used to but it is strangely effective. The support cast is impressive in depth but they are not all that well used. Walhberg has all the best lines but it seems like he has wandered in from another movie at times and, funny as he was, he is never the developed and involved character that he needed to be for the way the narrative required. Baldwin is the same although he is more restrained and fits better, while Sheen is a nice touch of class. The woman playing the girlfriend is as weak as her material and although she did have an important part in the story, she adds very little beyond the writing on the page.Overall though, this is a strong and professional film and it is a shame that it isn't as good as I wanted. The attempts to paint detailed and complex characters makes it interesting but not as convincing as it needed to be Â with Damon in particular left out there with little to work with in comparison to DiCaprio. The moments of slick tension and action are very good though and the only downside was that it made me wish for more of the same and that Scorsese had focused on keeping it tight and taut in the same way that the superior original had."
"This film should have just been called ""Infernal Affairs - Slightly different ending"".All the ranters and ravers of how glorious a film this is are those obviously oblivious to the existence of the far superior Hong Kong original.I'll admit I'm a huge fan of most of Scorsese's other work & was highly anticipating this release but upon watching this I was hugely disappointed, so much so that I almost fell asleep, & the only other times that has happened was during the remake of The Wicker Man - enough said there.Advice for anyone who has not seen this would be see the original & pray Hollywood doesn't make a sequel."
"Sigh. After seeing the raving comments here for this film, I have to do a double take.I watched it and enjoyed it, but it's just an average movie, with big stars and a famous director.It's OK at best. Worth a watch, but not worth getting to excited about, which is why I think there is a reality distortion around the ratings here.I think most people will watch this in 10 years and wonder what all the fuss was about. It's probably because this is the first film of this type that has been made successfully in a while, and so subconsciously we must be pretending it's going to make us feel warm inside like True Romance or Goodfellas; probably because most people haven't seen Internal Affairs and so the main plot is new to them; and probably because it bagged an Oscar and everyone figures it's hip to dance at the winning party.Lets be clear, the original Internal Affairs worked because it left gaps, which helped get a sense that time had passed and you accepted that each of the main characters had gradually worked into their respective positions over many years.This gave a sense of increasing tension as each of their relatively comfortable positions were made more vulnerable, when essentially, they were activated for the first time by each of their masters for the end game.With this remake, it fails because they tried to fill those gaps with well known actors and then provided them with excess dialog to warrant their appearance; as a result the situations the protagonists find themselves in, feels forced.If Costello was really the evil, guilt free gangster Nicholson was trying to portray, then frankly, he'd have had no hesitation taking Costigan outside to dance with a few bullets and put the doubt out of his mind once and for all.It reminds me of another Scorsese film where an evil, guilt free gangster had a few doubts about his associates and did exactly that.It felt real in that film, because, well, it was based on the real events and well... thats what evil, guilt free gangsters tend to do.As for the Oscars, well, it says something I suppose. The Aviator was a better made film, both for Scorsese and DiCarprio who nailed Howard Hughes. They should have bunged it Scorsese's way then, now it just feels arbitrary and robbed Little Miss Sunshine of best picture, of which it most certainly is."
"""The heaven sets spies upon us, will not have Our contract celebrated."" Shakespeare, The Winter's taleIt's not Taxi Driver or even Goodfellas, but Martin Scorsese's Departed is one of the year's best films and one of his best, after his 2 or 3 indisputable classics such as Raging Bull. The director has assembled a first-rate cast, who, right down to Jack Nicholson as mobster kingpin Frank Costello, are having a great time nudging each other's performances toward excellence through collaboration.Remade from a 2002 Hong Kong smash called Infernal Affairs, The Departed tells of moles within the Boston State Police Department and the South Boston Irish-American mob. When the director opens the film with Costello's brief narration and the Stones' Gimme Shelter for background music, we're in for a whole lot of no shelter for anyone and uncommon acting for everyone. The set up is just complex enough to act as a metaphor for the nasty workings of the United Nations, Iraqi Assembly, and US Congress. Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) willingly serves as a mole in the South Boston Irish-American mob for the State Police, while Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) does the same in the State Police for the mob.Amongst the intertwining machinations of cell phones and lies is a triangle with those two operatives and a psychologist Madolyn (Vera Farmiga), as well played by the three as could be hoped for in such a trumped-up situation that provides little sexual payoff for audience voyeurs and many scratched heads for those who enjoy well-structured plots. This triangle is the only disappointment in a film layered expertly to show how intertwined crime and punishment can be in a world last laid bare by Clint Eastwood's Oscar-winning Mystic River (2003).Cinematographer Michael Ballhaus and production designer Kristie Zea are winning collaborators with the director for a look that is authentic (I worked in South Boston for 3 years), crisp, and dark. But in the end the film belongs to the actors, chief among them DiCaprio as a young Scorsese acolyte showing the master's handiwork after 3 films with him. And Matt Damon has never been better in his hometown, as has fellow South Bostonian Mark Wahlberg in his role as a detective with a barbed tongue and equally sharp intuition.Welcome back, Martin S. The Departed may not win you an Oscar, but it does guarantee you never will be ""departed"" from the pantheon of premiere American directors."
"Jack Nicholson does his impersonation of Rip Torn, Dicaprio and Damon are distinguished only because one of them (but which?) has some facial hair, and all of them and everyone else puts on a lousy ""Southie"" Boston accent so even the actors natively from there come across as fake. Except a few actors put on a fine Irish Brogue so you know they're Irish. Such entertainments are needed in this remarkably plot-free orgy of camp, grumbling, meaningless shootouts and poignant cell phone usage. I haven't counted to see if cell phones are used as often as guns, but no doubt a future thesis on the theme is lurking.Jack Nicholson at one point refers to the John Hancock building. That's a building in Boston. Wow, Nicholson was so in character he might have just winged that.Everyone calls everyone else a rat, or an undercover, and sometimes they say things like ""He's undercover!,"" What undercover?"" ""No, he's my undercover."" Abbott and Costello more humorously expressed it: Who's rat's on first?There's also authentic Hollywood crime lingo, like ""were you tailed"" (a play on rats perhaps).Everyone informs on everyone else and in the end, everyone shoots everyone else, except one person who's character is so vague you can look him or her in the eye and not know who. ""I want my identity back,"" says one character, mysteriously. All of this highlights the key themes of the film, that everyone is everyone else, and in the end, only cell phones survive.There's also a lot of looking in cell phones, presumably because to Hollywood types, even more than the rest of us, looking at cell phones is done often and always is a thrill. This movie is a really good argument for having movies directed instead of run by mugging improvisers; alternatively a future film can dispense with actors entirely, and focus entirely on cell phones and computer screens.However the City of Boston, played largely by itself, is convincing.T"
"This is a terrible movie. It's two and a half hours of obscenities instead of script, violence instead of acting and Jack Nicholson playing who else but Jack Nicholson.I'm sure a lot of people will say all this was necessary to give the grittiness to the movie. It isn't; think of the great gangster movies of the thirties, forties and fifties. Bogart and the lot never said any more than, ""darn"" and most violence was implied rather than cataloged.It's no wonder society is running out of control when this type of sick movie wins an Oscar.Bruce"
"First of all, I must say this is THE worst Martin Scorsese movie I have ever seen. I usually like Scorsese's movie, but this one is the first one I have encounter that totally blow me away in its awfulness.My first problem with The Departed is the casting. They got a bunch of baby-face fruitcakes like Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Anthony Anderson and Mark Wahlberg which totally throws the suspension of disbelief out of the window. It is like watching a bunch of boy scouts playing cops and robbers - None of them look like cops - more like boy scouts.Secondly, the acting, is just wooden. There is no subtlety in the acting, and they try to cover that up by over-acting, and constant swearing. (Perhaps it is to make them look more ""mature"" for their part.) Now, about the plot, it is pretty thin, and confusing at times, lacks clarity or resolve. The several scenes made me cringe, particularly when Jack Nicholson tries to torture Leonardo DiCaprio, it just seems totally unbelievable after Jack Nicholson violently tortured DiCaprio and he trusted him AGAIN!! Now, about Matt Damon's acting in this movie, it is pretty god damn bad. In fact, what acting!!?? Matt Damon just doesn't emote at all!! He is as souless and as wooden as a robot. It is extremely wooden as if he is the living proof that Pinocchio exist!Leonardo's acting is more of his usual self, pretty boy in distress with endless whinings to anyone who would lend his ears to him - but in this movie, he seems particularly out of place. The character development lacks subtle internal conflicts presented in the original character so involving and multi-dimensional.Jack Nicholson is just his usual sly scoundrel self. Totally uninspiring acting. Same goes with Martin Sheen's super stiff acting. Anthony Anderson is totally mis-casted in this movie as if he is a comic relief (and yet there is nothing comic about it)The character development and inter-character dynamics are almost non-existent between the two rivaling characters (Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon) it is as if they are in two separate movies. The movie not only lacks any subtlety but blatantly plays up the caricatures of what we perceived as ""mafia"" - loud mouth constantly swearing goons - it is both extremely clichÃ© and uninteresting.The plot is also pretty confusing due to extremely bad direction, it lacks focus, and the camera work is also chaotic and uninteresting."
"I have never been more disappointed in a movie in my life. A great twist in a movie is one like ""the Usual Suspects"", where there were clues to the deception. In this film, the twists were just thrown out in mid air. Also, the entire ""love story"" angle was useless. Finally, having 3 or 4 or 5 endings was ridiculous. Sorry, one more thing, so who was the good guys, who are we rooting for? I wanted to love this movie so bad. But I wound up hating it. Sorry. One example of a useless scene. Jack Nicholson is in a porn movie theater and finds Matt Damon. Now, Matt Damon has essentially lived his life to protect and serve ""mobster"" Nicholson. What does Nicholson do? Threaten to take away his girlfriend. How I will never know? Then advise him he is not doing enough for him. HUH??????? Damon was so loyal to Nicholson you would have thought he was his father. Just another example of a scene where the writer and director tried too hard and simply failed."
"Do you know the story about the king who left his palace naked and everyone in the crowd watching him were commenting on his splendid clothes? This is how I feel after reading reviews from well-known and ""respected"" critics on Scorcese's ""The departed"". Because that is what Scorcese's film is-it is naked, devoid of any rhyme or reason, of any reason why things happen, of any values. To me it is just the ranting of an older man, it is Scorcese fantasizing about violence, sex, corruption ; it is Scorsese thinking ""wow it is so clever to show all this blood and to have my actors swear all the time, yeah this is art"" . Well, I am sorry, but this isn't art. This is about Scorsese repeating himself and indulging in his obsessions and us congratulating him. I am not a conservative person- I just feel like the little boy in the story who cried out that the king was naked; like the little boy who wasn't a hypocrite and just showed things as they were."
"What a shame. Scorcese, the old one, lived in a world that worked differently than the world of most folks. His world has no God, no laws, no fate, no environment. His world is a world of characters who exude the world. If there are apparent laws, it is because of the force of people creating the space they project into. He works in this way because its his heritage, an Italian legacy both in culture and film. And because it works. A filmmaker's job is to define a world in a film, ideally in the first few moments of a film. There are all sorts of ways to do this and the way we digest what we see has a lot to do with how it is served in this way.One way, the way the old Scorcese used, was to invest wholly in bodies. Focus the camera completely on people, a few very, very strong people, and grow the world and a whole world system Â usually based on simple ethics Â around it. It means you have the latitude to develop some loud, apparently full characters, but it also carries disadvantages: we never can fold his movies into our lives. We can never overlap our world into his, because his doesn't exist.He knows these limits. He's spoken of them privately, and in his last two films you could see him trying to outgrow the limits of the old Scorcese. With ""Gangs"" he reached far into space, defining places, a city, underground havens, mobs, the flow of rumors through society. He reached to groups. His camera flew, not as expertly as DePalma's but wildly compared to old filmmaker's which was tethered to single bodies. ""Gangs"" overreached and ran out of money, time and the patience of his patrons, so it was wrapped up with some explosive characters.""Aviator"" showed us a new man. I hailed him as the best new filmmaker of that year. He drifted into the world, away from characters. He designated a watcher in Blanchett, something he has never done before, and he let he bring her tools of folded narrative to bear. It was film worth watching, his first one in my opinion.And now we have the old fellow backsliding into his easy manner, his cheat. His way of delivering apparent power with no power. Yes, it is well put together. Yes, it has serious actors doing their bit without worrying about how it fits in the symphony. There is no grand design, just speechifying. Yes, the use of music is perhaps the most competent you will ever find.But it is empty. Again. We lost a filmmaker this year.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."
"With out Siu Fai Mak, this film would never have happened - even from Martin Scorsese. It is evident that Hollywood has completely run dry of new ideas and is seeking great films from Asian nations to make money - e.g. 'The Ring'. After years of great original gangster films from Scorsese, I am disappointed. A setting in Boston, is the only original item of this film. For those unfamiliar with Siu Fai Mak, I deeply encourage you to watch 'Mou Gaan Dou' ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338564/ ) aka 'Infernal Affairs' - the basis for this film. Infernal Affairs contains far more intense drama and (if not better) an equally high quality acting roster than this remake. Although this film was greatly entertaining, it would not have been made if not for the 2002 original from China."
"Sorry, thought this was very bad.Terrible story, have not seen Infernal Affairs but State of Grace and even the pilot of The Shield were far superior and credible.Wahlberg too weak for the role, his scenes with Baldwin and Damon were comical.Alec Baldwin, enough said...Nicholson overacting wildly the rat impression made me cringe.DiCaprio's performance was going OK until the line ""I can't believe you are so vulnerable right now"" - Vulnerability! couldn't see that emotion anywhere but it seemed I was supposed to, which made me question the whole performance.Matt Damon was actually quite good.Direction - the film looked good, sounded good but all to no avail when tied to such a poor story.Not trying to pick a fight just my opinion. Nearly every review has been positive surely someone else hated it?"
"The director practically gutted the original story. This is classic Hollywood doings. I've never seen a worse adaptation from an original movie. They basically added more sex scenes and cut out all the meaningful parts of the original stories, made the story choppy and hard to follow, then stick a couple of big names to draw the audience. The original Hong Kong movie Infernal Affairs has a solid character development. Infernal Affairs also used more intelligent ways of communication between the undercover and the source, making you sit at the edge of your seat. Aside from much stronger story lines, it also portrayed mental health workers in a much more professional manner...the psychiatrist in the Departed would've had her license taken away in a snap as there are strict laws prohibiting dual relationships. Just like all meaningless mainstream movies, as if putting in a sex scene and showing some flesh would make up for the horrid chopped up story. The original made the psychiatrist-patient relationship more real and tapped into the inner workings of the psychiatrist working with an undercover. If you are looking for a truly well written screenplay with deep emotional plots, go watch the original Infernal Affairs instead!"
"This movie sucked big time. I agree with all of those who complained about the abusive and unrealistic cursing, specially when coming from the cops. It makes no sense that educated people whose job it is to run investigations would keep talking like that all the time. But even if you choose to suspend disbelief on that matter, there are just too many inconsistencies to be able to let yourself taken in for the ride. Other viewers have described them very well, so I thank them for saving me the time. I also felt a great disappointment since I used to think that Martin Scorsese was a great director. Well no more I guess. Just another big commercial production which just doesn't fly... Too many heavy weights and too much pandering to the lowest common denominators, this recipe usually favored by Hollywood only succeeded in giving me an indigestion... buuurrrp!!!"
"Last night i went to watch 'The Departed'. I left this movie feeling utterly sick to my stomach due largely to the poor quality of the movie. Friends commented on the bad mood in which i was in walking back to my car....my only comment was that i apologise, however the movie 'The Departed' was so poor in quality....so poor it truly is ridiculous...it simply put me in a bad mood. This was a world first...i have seen other bad movies in my life...however this one actually made me feel emotions of anger / disappointment / disillusionment all at once. I fully understand that readers would be asking 'why..o why' have u condemned such a, and a quote 'Film of the Year' (LOL). Well, readers here are the following reasons exactly why 'The Departed' is possibly the worlds worst movie..1. OVERALL STORYLINE...15 minutes into the movie it was clear what was going to happen...Matt Damon was a snitch....Leo DiCaprio was a snitch....the ONLY thing we the viewer now needed to see was exactly how all involved parties (Nicholson, FBI, Cops, other miss. randoms) were going to find out and consequently act about it..You may wish to argue against me...however look into your hearts...you know what i say is true...and hence you must realize the stupidity of such a movie...2. ELEVATOR SCENE LOL - Quite possibly the worst scene of any movie, of any form, of any generation. NOT and over dramatization. OK, i do understand that it was necessary in the overall storyline for those people to die...but really...4 people getting shot in the head.....LOL..people were laughing in the cinema...in this what Scorcese wanted?? The only thing achieved by that God forsaken scene was a 'novelty' effect created by 4 exactly similar gun shot...blood splatter..etc...at the conclusion of the scene i began to day dream that possibly it might be better if i was number 5...ready and willing to get shot in the head, ultimately putting myself out of the misery which was 'The Departed'.3. Mark Walhberg His stint in this movie is laughable..i really am laughing at this very moment...He plays a tough talking cop....lol...arguably promoting as a main character in the film...HOWEVER has NO (0) relevance in the film whatsoever...EXCEPT for KILLING damon at the very end???4. Look, readers of this website...their really are to many things i hate about this movie to continue...Di Caprio / storyline / people in the cinema laughing about ridiculous Nicholson antics (such as patting a dog??? (is that funny or are people just stupid??)??. Anyway, i appreciated your time...hopefully you all understand my reasons and if you don't i truly do feel sorry for you...moreover i already feel sorry for us all for going to watch this move.Marko J OUT"
"I went to see this movie with Infernal Affair fresh in mind. I wanted to compare the two. and I did. I thought The Departed was really good but not better than Infernal Affair. there were a few changes but they were more upsetting than making the remake better. Matt Damon is not as charming and cool as Andy Lau in his character. I feel that they have soften the character for Matt Damon. Leonardo Di Caprio was pretty good in his role though I must admit that i was more 'attached' to Tony Leung. Overall, I find that The departed is just a remake of Infernal Affair: it didn't really add up much. SPOILER: i really hate the The Departed ending. Why did they end it like that? They should have stuck to the same ending as Infernal Affair. But then, if they did, Mark Wahlberg's character would have been useless...Even though it's Scorsese, it cant beat Infernal Affair. I give it an 8 because I gave Infernal Affair a 10."
"just saw this movie. absolutely pointless. everyone can fluff Scorsese, Nicholson, etc, but this movie is not that good. everyone may think its good because all movies now are garbage. however, a better smelling bag of garbage beside a worse smelling bag of garbage is still a bag of garbage. DiCaprio does a good job and Damon is surprisingly good, but the story is just so blah and predictable that it is easy to fall asleep while watching the movie. in my opinion,the movie does not focus enough on one character to facilitate viewer involvement. also,the music is not prominent enough and some of it is recycled from other Scorcese films which makes a veteran movie goer such as myself think Scorcese should ride off into the sunset."
"First I saw 'The Departed'. It was cool. Then I saw 'Infernal affairs'. It was awesome. Then, after some time, I saw 'The Departed' again. And I realized I've been conned. I wish there was a way to talk about 'The Departed' without constant references to IA, but there isn't. This is not a re-imagining, it is not a remake or a tribute- it's a pure and simple rip-off, most of the time scene by scene, shot by shot. Everything that is good, interesting or storytelling in 'The Departed' originates in IA. All they did was change the setting and the language and dumb down the story here and there with some melodramatic/vulgar effects. Speaking of vulgar; I don't give a s**t about 'ugly words', some of the best movies are full of cursing, and hell, that's how people really talk after all. But... i just couldn't get past of how scenes that are subtle and cool in IA are almost systematically replaced with mindless cursing-orgies here. It's not that they curse it's that they ONLY do that, as if a tirade Wahlberg-style could actually replace acting and real emotions. It seems like throwing in a dick-joke, adding some punches, yelling, being all f**k this and f**k that is what makes true 'realism'. Even in minor scenes; in IA the mob-mole merely has a conversation with the psychologist; here he blows up, yells and runs away. After the cinema scene, when the cop nearly finds out who the mole is in IA you have a tense psychological scene; in The Departed Matt Damon MUST stab somebody, apparently the director doesn't think it's cool enough without that. Or the classic rooftop end scene- in IA the two opponents act calmly, with dignity- here there's cursing and fighting and punching instead of a shared moment of drama. In one word- it's cheap, something you wouldn't expect from Scorsese and this cast."
"OK. First off, I'm glad to see that ""The Departed"" has as many detractors as it has admirers. My objections to it, for the most part, have been filled in by other users. Therefore, I'll keep it brief. The movie's characters, just like its gushing audiences,seem to suffer from attention deficit disorder. As if they've never read a book in their lives. And it appears as if Scorcese had that in mind, knowing fully well in advance that the film would appeal to people who seemingly have no problem with the F word being uttered every twelve seconds--whether it's in the movies, or in their actual,everyday pedestrian conversations. Which, I've found to be a problem with those who, quite simply,did not stay in school long enough. And who would believe-- even for a second--that two members of the Boston P.D.(played by Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg) would engage in banter graphically describing how each of them had sex with the other guy's mother--at a meeting where the bulk of the attendees consists of top- level Federal Agents?. What are these guys--in the 8th Grade? If I held that position in real life ( FBI,CIA,etc. ),I--while walking out on the two of them-- would look both in the eye and let them know what slobs they are.Finally, to switch gears, I guess nobody thought the film went awry when Leo DiCaprio has apparently no trouble beating the hell out of two grown men from the Rhode Island branch of the Cosa Nostra (man, that's some muscle that got sent in from Providence, huh?). All of it punctuated by the unnecessary--not to mention perfunctory-- accompaniment of The Human Beinz ""Nobody But Me"". And later, when one of Nicholson's men is being interrogated, we are treated to about six and a half seconds of ""Sail On Sailor"". If you're anything like me, when you think grueling questioning, you think... Beach Boys. And don't get me started on the fact that this is an Oscar winning film, the last ten minutes of which consist of not one...not two... not three...but four-count 'em-- men getting a bullet through his brain. Lovely.Just like the conclusion of ""Babe"", where the talking pig wins the Sheepdog Contest. Guaranteed... when you're at some guy's house/apartment--and you don't see any bookcases--that if the subject of this film comes up, he'll tell you just how terrific it was. Childish, pernicious drivel."
"I am not a real film buff, and neither is my wife. I had heard that this film was supposed to be good, and rented it. Despite the excellent cast and good production values, I couldn't believe how labored the script was, and how much overacting was taking place (much of it by Nicholson).When we finished watching the movie, I remarked to my wife that I must have gotten the film confused with some other. I went to IMDb to see what rating it had gotten -- I figured maybe a 6.7 or something.To my disbelief, it lands in the top 100, and won the best picture Oscar! I went back to tell my wife that it had won the best picture, and she thought I was joking. Then her reaction was that someone had hacked my computer.As far as the comments here, I would have had to think that there was a large astroturf component. But with the film winning best picture, I guess I am just seeing one of those occasional mass delusions that happens in the world.But what I *really* can't believe is that it won best script. Un. Be. Lievable. This script was so bad, and so unconvincing, that after I told my wife that it had won best picture and director, I remarked that for sure it couldn't have won best scriptwriting. But it did.I simply don't understand what people see in this film. The plot is sophomoric. The involvement of Costello in routine pickups and deliveries, and the immediate trust and access to the boss given Costigan, is so implausible that I find it difficult to believe anyone can take this film seriously. Is it supposed to be camp or something?"
"I didn't know who directed the movie until the credits when the name Scorsese popped up, so I saw the movie without any expectations. I must say I wasn't very impressed. First off the infiltration of Costigan into Costello's gang happened way too fast and wasn't very convincing, just like the infiltration of Leo's character in Gangs of New York. Mark Wahlberg's character Dignam felt really fake, the kind of language he used was not very likely to be used by someone in his position, same goes for Baldwin's character capt. Ellerby. The love triangle drama was just pathetic, why would she date some ex con with drug problems when she's already moving in with Sullivan, a career cop who climbs the latter in the department like a sky rocket (i.e. very unlikely). They tried to portrait Costello as this big time mobster but the way he handled business felt more like a small time gangster, stealing pocket change from some corner shop.I haven't seen the original Infernal Affairs so I can't say weather or not this was worse, but I would really think so. The only part that surprised me positively was in the end when the other mull showed up and blew Costigans brains out, I didn't expect that one. That kind of woke me up, too bad it was just before the credits."
"so lame. you didn't believe any motives behind any character. Nicholson & marky mark make you laugh i hope on purpose. Matt Damon doesn't get hit in the head nearly enough. there's a funny nod to jack's joker. do not expect goodfellas. don't even expect a chainsaw sequel/prequel. think more like scary movie 2, but without trying.do Southey's ever get tired of being made fun of in movies? between this and mystic river, i'd be real upset. i get it, Irish guys love their moms and miss their dads. the only thing that could have made this worse is if ed burns was in it. the best performance was the lady with the nose plugs."
"I am a fan of Martin Scorsese but this movie sucks. This movie is a remake of a Hong Kong movie called ""Internal Affairs."" If you have never seen the original, then please do so because you will definitely appreciate how well the original was as opposed to this crap made by Scorsese.Why do I hate ""Departed?"" First, Scorsese was an idiot putting Jack Nicholson as the crime boss because he is going to steal the whole damn movie. Nicholson is that talented. Plus, Scorsese gave too much part to the crime boss character. He should have been a tangential character with the real crux of the movie focused on Matt Damon and Di Caprio.Second, Matt Damon's character was too one dimensional or there was no real complexity to his character. He was simply bad. In Internal Affairs, the bad cop was more complex. In that movie, you see a cop becoming annoyed by the crime boss who he sees as a threat to his future.Third, there was more violence and sex in this movie than in Internal Affairs and I love gratuitous violence and sex in a movie so long as it is done properly. Scorsese just injected more sex and violence to cover up his terrible script adaption of an excellent film.Fourth, the dialog was fine but again, it lacks intelligent discourse among the principal characters so I cannot say it was great writing. It was simply mediocre at best.Fifth, and primary reason I hate this movie is that there is no real TENSION between the characters. Oh sure, Damon character wants to kill Di Caprio and vice a versa but there has to more to this than that. In the original, there was interaction between the bad cop and good cop, but you see that the bad cop is not so truly bad and therefore, the audience is torn. What I am trying to say is that there was a subtle buildup to the real tension in that movie which makes you really appreciative of the quality of that movie as oppose to this crap.That being said, if you have never seen Internal Affairs, then you will like this movie. But if you are like myself and some others who have seen it and have seen this movie as well, then you will be disappointed. In fact, for those who decide to rent Internal Affairs, I can almost guarantee that you will like Internal Affairs much more than Departed. You will like Internal Affairs so much more that you will see what a junk Departed really is."
"I know that it is not difficult to say that in every remake's case, but this one really got my hopes high. Unfortunately, it wasn't the case this time. Don't get me wrong, the movie is still great, it just falls below expectation. Yes, Di Caprio is great for the first time (he was good in some movies before, but here he is just superb). Nicholoson - is over the top, being 69 years old he is still much more charismatic and believable than his young rivals. The rest of the cast is just good, no flaws.Whenever they tried to stick to the original - everything worked great. For some unfortunate reason they decided to over-complicate already sophisticated screenplay - and spoiled it. There are some unnecessary characters creating the mess, some FBI storyline in the movie that only God knows what that was intended for. And also the ending - I do not know, ending in the Hong-Kong movie was reasonable and understandable, here it is basically the same - but messy. In the original all of the characters had very clear reasons for everything they did, and they lost it here.My biggest problem with that one is that in the original neither one of the main 2 characters was either complete bastard or saint - and here they actually made it black and white.And no, don't forget about Taxi Driver:) this one is very good (especially if you have not seen the original), but not great."
"Oh dear, it's Scorsese does Tarantino with some Goodfellas thrown into the mix (even down to using the Human Beanz - Nobody But Me for a fight in a shop). The first third of the film is excellent, despite the constant sound of the Rolling Stones - Gimme Shelter every five minutes, but then it goes downhill fast. The basic premise of a cop infiltrating the Irish mob and a mobster infiltrating the cops is good, but soon so many other things are thrown into the plot it becomes a farce. Why make Costello am FBI informer? Pointless, other than maybe to give Matt Damon a reason to kill him, although it would have been a thousand times more interesting if Damon's reason was Nicholson's dismissive treatment of him since a teenager. Why did Matt Damon's character have so much power to do as he liked in the force after only joining a few months back, able even to call a surveillance of Sheen police chief? Stupid. How come Damon didn't figure out immediately that Dicaprio's character used his phone at the meet with the Chinese? He knew the whole of Nicholson's crew apart from Costigan, but Scorsese just needed to drag the film out for another hour. Why was Baldwin's character camping it up like a pantomime dame all over the screen? The acting from Baldwin was so bad it made me think he was play acting for Damon's character and actually new he was a mole, but he didn't, Baldwin just can't act. The mess of shootings at the ending wasn't a twist either it was very dull 'ho hum' and 'so what' and i had lost interest half an hour earlier when Nicholson exited the film. After the first hour this film is silly, contrived and with no clever plot twists at all but just pointless adding of layer on layer of meaningless guff. If someone tells you this is an intricate and well plotted film, don't believe them, point them in the direction of The Usual Suspects."
"American remake of the successful ""Internal Affairs"" trilogy, about two men seeking out each other's identity; one is a cop that goes undercover as a mobster, the other, a mobster that goes undercover as a cop. Dream-boats Damon and DiCaprio do a good job vanishing into their roles as tough guys, but their charm and ruthlessness still can't mask the crime-thriller clichÃ©s; and the ultra-climatic conclusion is just really nothing more than simply over-the-top. The wittiness of Jack Nicholson doesn't impress since he doesn't seem to do much acting, but rather just charismatically act like Jack. The quirky dialogue of Irish-American mobsters comes off as corny and tiring. Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg are memorable and well-delivered in the humorous good-cop-bad-cop odd-couple, with the latter earning a Best Supporting Actor nomination. It was the only nomination that was well-deserve, the only nomination that didn't win and the only nomination that should have won. Won Best Picture, Editing and Adapted Screenplay. It should be called ""The Retarded"".*Â½ (out of four)"
"I don't want to vote for this movie but I find it very low from the Americans to remake an Asian movie and to get (or will get)a bigger success then the original movie.I want to criticize the American movie industry because they are not original. It is better to search for original ideas then to play the role of the copycat in our society.I wanted to say my opinion to those who appreciate the American movie industry so much.(and surely this movie)good examples of remaked movies are : the ring , the grudge , the seven samurai, Godzilla , (masked rider) and more (they planned also to make an American version of Battle royale)Even if they remake it well they will never win my respect and i will consider it like fake.thank you"
"What a waste to a masterful script! Scorsese has totally wrecked the script by polluting it with unnecessary profanity, gore, blood and tasteless sex scene. The only good thing about this remake is Jack Nicholson performance (except for the rubber penis). The original is thought provoking and make you want to see it over and over again. The characters in the original are captivating. The characters in the remake seems shallow and pointless. You don't feel for any of the characters, even the supposedly good guys, i.e. Martin Sheen, Mark Walberg and Leonardo DiCaprio because Scoresese did not care spending the time to build the story behind the 3, instead he just overloaded Walberg character with mindless swearing and stupid insults to DiCaprio. What for?????? The last few scene of shooting is even laughable. What a mistake! This is just one messy remake of a perfectly good movie."
"I thought I kind of liked Departed, despite its obvious continuity problems (surprising from such a supposedly amazing director), before I saw infernal affairs and realized what a blatant word for word, scene for scene, rip off this movie is. I'm giving Departed 1 star. Scorsese shows off his lack of creativity once again. I'll be giving Infernal Affairs 10 stars to compensate for other reviewers!! If you haven't seen Infernal Affairs I highly recommend it. You will not be able to help comparing it to Departed because it's all there- every scene! But it will be worth it to see what true originality and creativity look like. Tony Leung is one of the best actors in the world and though this is not his best film it is still well acted considering the Hollywood style of the movie.-Yes, I'm hating on Hollywood now. Scorsese obviously tried to fill his film (rip-off) with as many big name Hollywood stars as possible to compensate for the fact that he added nothing original to his movie. If imitation is the highest form of flattery then that's all the more reason to see Infernal Affairs. For those of you looking for an unbiased review of the Departed-sorry you're not getting it here. I just finished watching Infernal Affairs and all the tension and coolness I thought was in Departed was displayed so much better there- in it's original form. Oh, and did I mention that Infernal Affairs is an original- not that originality counts for much I guess. I don't mean to bash Scorsese completely. He does get props for recognizing that Infernal Affairs is a good original movie. But like the character in the movie- no spoiler here- Scorsese mimics something but does not become that thing. This has been his trade mark from the beginning."
