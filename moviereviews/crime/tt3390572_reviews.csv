"HAIDER to me is an acronym that means the following:H. Haunting. Be it in its background score, music, lyrics, playback (especially Rekha Bharadwaj, Sukhwinder Singh, and Arijit Singh), cinematography, or backdrop of Kashmir in 1995, Haider is Haunting, and how! The film will stay with you long after you have left the theater.A. Astounding. Haider is an astoundingly adept adaptation of a classic written almost 415 years ago that can be enjoyed irrespective of your knowledge about the Shakespearean Tragedy - Hamlet. If you don't know Hamlet, great! You do? Even better! I. Incredible. Haider is incredible - in terms of its performances. Be it that of Shahid Kapoor (Haider/Hamlet) who performs a complex role with the kind of award worthy chutzpah that should silence all his detractors once and for all. Or for that matter the the triumvirate of Tabu (Halala/Gertrude) - ethereal, dauntless, and supreme, Kay Kay Menon (Khurram/Claudius) - terrific, resolute, and subtle or Irfan Khan (Rooh/The Ghost of Hamlet's father) - rudimentary and underplayed. Not to be forgotten is Shraddha Kapoor (Aarshi/Ophelia) who pitches in a performance that is 'picture'esque perfect and so full of finesse. And of course the two Salman Khan's who are fans of the superstar and who will surely gain some fans of their own post this film. In fact, every single member of the cast pitches in a perfect performance here, irrespective of the role and duration.D. Daring. Haider is daring in talking about issues that many wouldn't touch with a bargepole and for the way it has juxtaposed a Shakespearean tragedy with a human tragedy - Kashmir. The valley is a character here that finally finds a voice of its own. The interpretations of that voice are truly brilliant.E. Effective. Sometimes experimentation and reinterpretations fail. Not here. With layer upon layer waiting for the audience to be interpreted (for example the touch of Oedipal complex between a mother and son, the growing of guilt of a well meaning lover, the song of the gravediggers, the examples of 'Chutzpah' and its comparison with AFSPA etc). Haider is effective on multiple levels and truly faultless in its execution.R. Rooh (Spirit/Soul). This is a film with an indomitable spirit that filmmakers would die to include in their body of work, and which Vishal Bharadwaj effectively manages to in this lifetime. This film has that which many a masterpiece may sometimes lack - a soul. A terrific triumph encompassing its soulful music, soul stirring performances, and soul warming message.In short - watch Haider - in a theater. For Vishal Bharadwaj, the Director/Composer/Writer. For Shahid, the rising prince. For Tabu the eternal Queen. For Gulzar, the lyricist. For the cinematography by Pankaj Kapoor and the editing by Aarif Sheikh. And finally for Kashmir, the unforgettable voice of humanity."
"When films transmute William Shakespeare's poetic imagery and the atmosphere that his verses conjure into re-imagined, re- contextualized visuals, and not merely reproduce the action with select dialogues, a movie adaptation of a Shakespeare play can be considered successful. That is why, thought British film scholar Roger Manvell, Shakespeare often translates best in what he considered ""foreign films"". The setting is one of the reasons Haider, Vishal Bhardwaj's adaptation of Hamlet, works. It is true to the haunting ambiguity of the characters' motives in the original play, Shakespeare's most opaque of tragedies, but the Kashmir canvas is potent. Bhardwaj's visual intelligence and the screenplay by Bhardwaj and Basharat Peer, one of India's acute commentators on Kashmir, his home state, add to the effective localization. Shakespearean purism aside, Haider is a thrilling film. It is a film of luxuriant paranoia. It is about Oedipal love. Unlike the cardboard insurgency imagery or images of damaged beauty that soak most films about Kashmir, Haider is an unflinching take on the Kashmir malaise, the tragedy infused with a sense of dark humor about the ordinary Kashmiri's hopelessness. Compared to Bhardwaj's earlier two Shakespeare adaptations, Maqbool (Macbeth) and Omkara (Othello), both of which depended heavily on language and dialogues and used Shakespeare's stories rather conveniently to propel the plot, Haider is a quieter yet richer spectacle and a convincing standalone piece. Bhardwaj chooses bold strokes over gloomy introspection, and in that sense, Haider is in the tradition of mainstream Hindi cinema. The picturization of songs is riveting to watch (Pankaj Kumar's cinematography is breathtaking throughout, and especially in the songs) and the songs are some of Bhardwaj's best compositions as a music director in recent times. The melodrama towards the end loosens the narrative and the last half hour feels like a bit of a drag, again a typical affliction in Hindi films. The protagonist is far from the melancholy Dane; Haider, which Shahid Kapoor plays with impressive zest and inventiveness, is more a dashing, combustible figure than a brooder. Bhardwaj also does away with the supernatural horror so integral to the original play, and which can be an easy tool for creating suspense and drama in cinema. The horror is in the everyday macabre reality of death, loss and waiting, and in the manipulation of a Kashmiri Muslim's emotions and insecurities. Haider (Kapoor) arrives in the Kashmiri village he left long ago to study at Aligarh after his father, a doctor, has disappeared. His mother Ghazala (Tabu) is romantically close to his father's younger brother (Kay Kay Menon). Arshi (Shraddha Kapoor), his childhood sweetheart, is torn between her pro-Indian establishment family and Haider, who is devastated to see his mother's sudden transformation. His idyllic childhood with parents seemingly in love is shattered. When Roohdar (Irrfan Khan), a mysterious man with a limp sends him a message from his lost father, Haider is on a destructive path of jealousy, hatred, turmoil and doubt. Central to the story is the relationship between Ghazala and Haider— a tender as well as anguished bond between mother and son, fueling the film as essentially an Oedipal drama. The romantic love between Arshi and Haider is almost a sweet afterthought. The casting ideas work impressively well. Kay Kay Menon stands out as a superbly calculating man, the villain in Haider's mind, and Tabu makes a heart-rending Ghazala. Shraddha Kapoor delivers an earnestly fervent performance and Irrfan Khan is pitch perfect as a quietly menacing presence, the only personification close to a ghostly apparition. Salman Khan is here too, in a deliciously manufactured ode to the Hindi film hero through Salman and Salman, Haider's friends and a pair of all-round crooks, an interesting replication of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern from the original play. Haider is an immensely effective re imagination of Shakespeare—and the film's biggest triumph is that the provincial, in this case Kashmir and the characters defined by its reality, shine in a universal and timeless tragedy"
"So, hours after I have finished watching the best movie to have come out this year( by a margin), I am finally in a condition to write anything about it. I am going to stick my neck out and say, Haider is the best work of Vishal Bhardwaj till date. There is no doubt, that for a story driven by passion, revenge, love and power, where emotional dispute forms the core of it, no land other than Kashmir, which has been living under the clouds of dispute ever since, would have been a better choice as the setting for the adaptation. The film is haunting and engrossing. It seamlessly adapts Hamlet and at the same time creates unforgettable characters of its own and makes us see a complex world through their eyes. I can't recall any other film which has completely been shot in the valley and surely none depicting it in all it's glory. The film takes off with the event around which the actions of all the the players of the movie would revolve. One gets only the first hour to get to know the basic nature of the characters as platform for the mind blowing second half is being built. At the cusp of the interval when an ever assured Irrfan Khan makes an intriguing entry, you only get a hint of things to come. The second half unleashes on you Shahid Kapur, who for the first time in his career shows glimpses of Pankaj Kapur. Those three minutes ( you would know which when you watch it ) where Shahid displays what all he is capable of, are those you would want to watch again and again. Kay Kay Menon is now a veteran and he doesn't disappoint.The only weak link to this extraordinary cast could have been Shraddha Kapoor, but she surprises everyone with a very composed yet captivating presence on screen. The heart of the film lies in the eyes of Tabu who makes the movie as deep as the depth of her eyes and as intensely beautiful as her voice. As we hear that Vishal Bhardwaj was not ready to make the film without Tabu, you will believe it once you have watched the film. There is no way you can expect anything short of the best from the dialogues and music, when Gulzar Saab and VB themselves are at helm and they ensure that you do not fall off track even for a moment. A cinematographer can hardly mess it up when you are shooting in paradise. After a brushstroke in Rockstar and a miniature art-piece in Lootera, we get to seethe full painting of Kashmir in Haider. There are enough funny spots in this dark tale of complex emotions,thanks to the fact that Salman Khan had long hair during the period the movie is set. The film has various undertones which were obviously part of the play as well. It would have required a director and screenwriter who is at the peak of his direction and writing skills to have made it happen. The dexterity with which Vishal Bhardwaj has been able to pull it off shows us why he is probably the best in the business in India. I feel, it requires at least another watching before one can completely absorb the enormity of the work that has been created. Salute Vishal 'Bard'waj. Go get Haidered because rarely do you get a chance to read literature on screen."
"Less cinematic & more theatrical!This movie seriously has too much! And too much of everything..The psychic-eccentric character of Haider in so many ways resembles Prithvi Bana (Gulaal) and has deeper connotation to the character's get-up & dialogs, some which can stay with us for long and make us get deeper into it every time we check it again!The '3 old men firing snipers' is the best western scene I've seen in Indian Cinema. Sergio Leone feel!The 'Bismil' sequence: Wow! What an achievement in theatrics in cinema! The best theatrical sequence since 'Jaane bhi do Yaaro' I would say! Much more than a song; it is a sequence that gets things out of control and sets the pace of the movie in the second half...'Aao Na Grave-digging' sequence is yet another beauty & I spurted out laughing crazily for some minutes! 'O Brother! Where Art Thou' feel!'Haider Stand-up Performance' is bloody good & gets metamorphic!Emotional turmoil handled in a spectacular way. The confrontation that the characters 'Haider', 'Arshia' & 'Ghazala' face is shown in an epic way The confrontation ignited by the dominant society for so-called larger good (haha)And what if this confrontation is prevalent everywhere in the society around you and there's a very thin line between being a 'friend of the society' or an 'enemy of the society'? Things get out of proportion and messy and sad and brutal and bloodyA brutal take on the Kashmir dilemma. I haven't experienced it in a better way...Super metaphorical mimicry on 'AFSPA' & 'Chutspa'Music that would just perfectly blend & leave deep impression!Power-packed performances make this movie an epitome of talent showcase I guess we get such output when the director doesn't compromise at all and expects nothing less than perfection in each aspect, in each sense And he eats, sleeps, drinks, thinks, trips just this movie for a very long time in life But however he does it, VB delivers something par excellence Has to be a super ambitious work!Mile stones in Hindi Cinema: 1. Gulaal & Haider 2. Maqbool 3. Gangs of Wasseypur and so on and so forthRight at the top for now! Wow!"
"Shahid kapoor has hit the bull's eye this time with haider. The ease with which he unveils the character of Hamlet on screen needs an OUT- standing ovation. He has exploited all his talent in the movie and has left no stone unturned. The other eye catching character is the protagonist's mother and I guess no one could have dine it better than Tabu. She has been a brilliant actress and again proves her mettle here. Kay Kay menon and Irrfan Khan are as always superb. Shraddha kapoor is sweet but does not have much to do. Overall, to go or not to go is not a question at all. It's a must watch and undoubtedly the best movie of year 2014 till now."
"Haider is the latest offering from the renowned Indian filmmaker Vishal Bhardwaj. Co-written by Basharat Peer and Bhardwaj himself, Haider is the third and final chapter in Bhardwaj's Shakespeare trilogy. Having already made successful adaptations of Macbeth (Maqbool, 2003) and Othello (Omkara, 2006), Bhardwaj was left with the choice of adapting either King Lear or Hamlet to complete his trilogy. He opted for the latter because of the presence of a strong sexual undercurrent in the source material—a motif that harks back to the first two films of the trilogy. The uncanny choice of Kashmir of the 1990s—a treacherous avenue of unparalleled beauty and unfathomable danger where people just disappear, never to return again—as the movie's backdrop proves to be a stroke of pure genius as it helps Bhardwaj in orchestrating an enchanting mise-en-scène that elevates an otherwise sprawling orgy of histrionics to the realms of realism. By the mid-1990s, Kashmir had taken the form of a like a spewing volcano, a ticking time bomb ready to go kablooey at any given moment. The terrorist insurgency in the Kashmir valley had started to pose a serious threat to India's sovereignty and the army had to be given a carte blanche so as to guard the country against any possible threat from both within and as well as outside the country. The people of Kashmir started seeing the growing military activity in the region as a violation of their basic rights. The separatist leaders saw this as a golden opportunity to galvanize the masses against the state and started adding fuel to fire as the valley got encompassed in a miasma of mistrust. Although, the situation has improved significantly over the last decade, a lot of work still needs to be done before the conflict can be fully resolved. Bhardwaj's film also leaves a strong message not only for people of Kashmir but for all humanity that nothing can be gained through revenge and in the absence of trust.Adapting a work of Shakespeare is no kid's play. Even the most experienced campaigners can falter if their ambition gets the better of them. The key to adapting any major work of literature is to be wary of one's limitations. Haider is far from being called a perfect adaptation of Hamlet. But, Bhardwaj, to his credit, gets the job done. There are moments of sheer brilliance but there is also a lot of drivel which could have easily been chopped off. Haider has all the makings of an epic but it faces some serious pacing issues towards the second half. Also, the narrative appears to be sketchy at some places. But, that's the price that one must be willing to pay for one's ambition. One of the main themes of Hamlet is chaos. This chaos is most evident in the play's central character who, in many ways, is a personification of confusion and duality. His highly complex, fascinating albeit bizarre nature makes him a singular character in all literature, endowed with contradictory traits that fade the lines that separate virtue and vice, heroism and villainy, and sanity and madness. In Haider, Vishal Bharadwaj and Shahid Kapoor try their best to grapple with the endless contradictions that define Hamlet's multidimensional character. Oedipus complex is another major theme that runs through Hamlet. The term Oedipus complex denotes the subconscious emotions and ideas that focus upon a child's desire to have sexual relations with the parent of the opposite sex. In Haider the syndrome is both latent and nuanced in comparison to the play.Haider not only serves as a decent adaptation of Hamlet, but it also proves to be a powerful socio-political commentary on Kashmir of the 1990s. Without the Kashmir angle, Haider would have appeared more empty and existential, with the Shakespearean characters merely playing their parts in a bid to reach the end of the trail. But, with Kashmir as its backdrop, it almost comes across as a propaganda films that aims to serve as a bitter reminder of our not too distant past. Haider is a warning of how easily the youngsters can be brainwashed and led astray by anti-national elements if the state machinery fails to look after them.While the acting is brilliant all around, it is Tabu who steals the show with a multilayered portrayal that would have guaranteed her an Oscar had Haider been a Hollywood production. Shahid Kapoor's performance in Haider is not perfect but is easily the best of his career, and it comes as no big surprise as Bhardwaj has a reputation to get the best out of his actors. Kay Kay Menon plays his detestable part with the desperation of a mangy scoundrel. Shraddha Kapoor serves well as an eye candy, but, beyond that, not much can be said of her acting. Irrfan Khan is brilliant as ever in the limited screen time that he gets. While the entire support cast does a reasonable job, Narendra Jha, who impresses in the role of Haider's father, deserves a special mention.Overall, Haider is a dark, distorted and diabolical work of cinematic art that falls well short of attaining perfection. At regular intervals, Bhardwaj tries to lighten up the mood perhaps to satisfy the cravings of the casual viewers. Needless to say, the movie is technically brilliant: cinematography, editing, and music are all at par with the international standards. The movie has several memorable sequences but the ones that stand out are: Shahid Kapoor's monologue, the sequence in which Haider brutally kills his captors, and the final graveyard sequence which may prove to be a real trendsetter as far as Hindi cinema is concerned. Haider is not meant for casual viewers for it will test their patience to the limit. As far as the intelligent viewers are concerned, the movie offers enough food for thought to keep them engaged. Highly recommended!For more, please visit, A Potpourri of Vestiges."
"Macbeth, Othello, and now Hamlet. Vishal Bharadwaj does it once again, by re-imagining Shakespeare in a very gritty Indian milieu. This time it is the Kashmir of 1995 in throes of militancy.The instruments Vishal Bharadwaj used for Maqbool and Omkara, are far sharper this time around. The songs are very rustic, and completely of the type to be found in street plays (not even a symbolic nod to Bollywood or a titillation to the audiences with a Bidi). The sense of suspense even sharper (even with a story with a basis as well known as Hamlet). The characters continue to be just as eccentric as in Omkara. And death once again continues to be not an infrequent visitor just like with Omkara. Yet the context is more sombre. And the whole scenario of militancy IMO dealt with quite responsibly with (what I would imagine to be) a good sense of reality.Not everything is wonderful. On the acting front, Tabu is impressive but understated. Shahid Kapur does well by his standards, but every so often I used to wonder how much better Pankaj Kapur would've done in some of the scenes. Shraddha Kapoor manages the role of pretty innocence well enough, but will probably cringe when she watches her own histrionics. Kay Kay Menon, and Irfan Khan of course are a pleasure to watch, but this is not their best film. While the songs aim to dramatise, I found them underwhelming and unnecessarily melodramatic in this context, Also the film is just a tad too long and could've been shortened by 15-20 minutes.Be prepared to see a Kashmir which does not look the swiss alps but still deserves to be considered amongst the most beautiful places on earth. This kashmir is a little raw. And forms the milieu for two concurrent threads, one the intra family drama which is the very essence of Hamlet, and the general environment of militancy and counter insurgency. Moreover the plot moves at a fairly measured pace and manages to retain the interest and fascination. It might surprise you (after my earlier paragraph), but these are the reasons why I would classify the movie to be a must watch.Yeah, go watch this, this is not to be missed, any complaints you might've notwithstanding."
"The movie Haider, as most of you would be aware of is an adaptation of Shakespeaes' Hamlet. It does help if you have read the original work ,but believe me there is nothing in the movie which you cannot understand if you have not read it.In fact if you have not read it till now,its better because the story would be anew to you. Set in Kashmir it takes the essence of problems faced in Kashmir valley due to insurgency and counterinsurgency measures though it doesn't focus on the problem alone. In a broad sense this movie is about search of a father by a son and subsequent events which leads him nearer towards revenge. First of all the movie is not everybody's cup of tea. You've to be very patient throughout to get the real pleasure out of it. The film is slow paced so as to draw you into it, just like an old wine. And, like an old wine you are supposed to sip it and not drink it in a hurry. The ensemble actor list is itself worth mentioning from Shahid ,Shradhha,Kulbhushan Kharbanda to the talented KK Menon,Tabu and of course the ever reliable Irfan Khan. Their performance is indeed flawless in the movie.The relationships are well portrayed ,the agony and trauma well expressed and the hate ,betrayal ,action scenes well-choreographed and scripted(especially the action sequence in the last scene). The only fault I could find in the acting department is that because of the presence of so many good actors (though the movie has good runtime still) much is left to be desired especially from Irrfan Khan whose performance is too succinct for an actor of his caliber. As said earlier, the movie is slow paced but the script doesn't fail the plot often. There is hardly anytime where you find yourself napping in the movie. Songs are good especially Arjit Singhs voice again creates magic with 'khul kabhi'.Cinematography, background score(which sometimes sound like Bourne trilogy) are also good. Accent training for the actors could have been better as anyone who has visited Kashmir for even a short duration would find only the two Salmaans accent to be genuine. But then it is a minor fault in a movie a cut above rest. If you are patient and could immerse yourself in the plot ,then the movie holds a lot of promise for you. But wont recommend to those who could not find tickets for another movie or those who want to have party time without application of brain.It is certainly not the best work you will ever see, but certainly a cut above rest, deserving a watch."
"Of the trilogy of films by Bhardwaj based on Shakespeare's work, Haider is probably the best one. The backdrop of 1990s Kashmir gives the film an unique look and feel. All the actors in the film have performed well. Most of the characters have grey shades but the actors have balanced the act. It appears as if the actors realized that they were working in a special film. Background score is brilliant; while most of the songs, unlike the regular Bollywood offerings, add value to the film and appear to be a part of the narrative. Can't find any major faults with this film. Of the Bollywood films that I have seen so far this year, Haider is the best bet for India's entry to Oscars. IMO, the film has created a new segment in Bollywood films. Bollywood films such as these can be enjoyed by global audiences as well much like many of the films from Europe, Latin America and South Korea."
"My rating:- 8 on 10=>What's Good:-1. Brilliant Cinematography2. Brilliant performances by all the star cast3. Special credits to Irfan Khan, Tabu, Shahid Kapoor and Kay Kay4. Songs went well with the situations...special credit to Bismil song.5. The movie has its on charm taking you into a different world6. The dark Kashmir of 90's =>What's Bad:-1.Very few scenes where your mind may be diverted or you may feel bored....but can be ignored easily as hardly one or two scenes for couple of minutes each.=>Final Words:- ""A very well directed movie with brilliant performances by all the star cast.....its a different genre movie,not for the masses....if any one is looking for a masala or typical Bollywood movie its no fun for them to watch.....as this one is slow which builds on the go and has its own charm and class""."
"Haider is not merely a remake of Hamlet. Vishal Bhardwaj has taken the source material, re-shaped it to meet the Indian context, and has made the story his own, while at the same time remaining faithful to the original. The story starts with Haider (Shahid Kapoor) returning to his home in insurgency-ridden Kashmir, after his father Hilaal Meer has been taken away by the army for treating an injured militant. Hilaal is a doctor, an idealist who believes in ""being on the side of life, not of ideology"". By the time Haider returns to his homeland, his father has joined the ranks of the ""disappeared"" and the home of his childhood has been destroyed. Worst of all, Haider's mother Ghazala (played by a luminous Tabu) seems to be drowning her sorrow in the arms of her brother-in-law Khurram (Kay Kay Menon). Haider joins the ranks of those Kashmiris desperately searching for their loved ones who have disappeared - seeking his father in hospitals and morgues, turning over blood-drenched bodies in a truck, a sheaf of photocopied photos of his father in his backpack. His childhood sweetheart (Shraddha Kapoor) tries her best to be supportive, but is unable to break through his wall of depression. His depression spirals into rage when he is contacted by a mysterious Roohdaar (Irrfan Khan) who confirms that his father has been killed because of the machinations of Khurram and Ghazala, and that his father's wish was for Haider to avenge his death. From then on, the movie descends into the depths of Haider's thirst for vengeance. The choices he makes, and the consequences of those choices drive the rest of the movie to its inevitable conclusion.Shahid Kapoor plays Haider in the role of a lifetime. His talent, generally obscured by his pretty-boy looks, is in full force here. His eyes mirror his vulnerability and despair, his rage and brutality and eventually his madness. The movie belongs to him. Tabu is Ghazala, glorious as ever. Described as half-widow, half- bride, she does a wonderful job of conveying forbidden obsession and desperation. Her relationship with her son, with their unexplainable passion for each other, is delicately portrayed. Kay Kay Menon is, as always, wonderful as the clownish and somewhat pathetic Khurram, gradually revealing his true face. Irrfan Khan is impressive in his small role as Roohdaar. Vishal Bhardwaj has succeeded in capturing the desolate beauty of Kashmir, once described as ""heaven on earth"". The snow takes on a character of its own, and as Haider spirals into madness and destruction, the snow-filled roads and woods seem more threatening than beautiful. The movie effectively captures the struggle of an entire people, trapped by misplaced patriotism and opposing ideologies. Not an action movie, watch it to see poetry translated to the big screen."
"Haider is one of my most awaiting movie of the year. As a Huge fan of Shahid Kapoor, I must say this is the best work done by him in his hole career. Tabu is natural in her role. The supporting cast Kay KayMenon is good. Shraddha looks sweet and cute.The relationship between Tabu and Shahid was far beyond than Imagination. Their Chemistry rocks and binds the viewers by their Performances. The story, screenplay, and dialogues are very good. Songs are superb. The track Bismil becomes too good with Shahid Dance and Expression. The Psychotic role in second half rocks. The guest appearance by Irfan Khan is superb. The back ground score is good.All in All I say this Movie is must watch. Ten on Ten"
"KUDOS !!!! Certainly how Hamlet is put into a Bollywood movie. Vishal deserves a pat on his back. Haider, it reveals a story based on Kashmir's life. If one has taste for real movies then this movie is worth watchable. Balance of Grudge and tragedy is beautifying Kashmir very well. Raw beauty of Kashmir will make you want to visit the place. Shahid, Tabu, Shraddha and Irfan have played well for their roles. Side characters in the movie will entertain you. Movie deserves time to draw your mind into it. One needs patience to see and understand the story. Message it contains at the end is to be peaceful. Such sensible movies are rare to see. Thumbs up for Haider, Shahid's fans will get to know why he'd go bald for a movie.Don't miss a valuable movie for your time !!!!!!!!!!"
"This is a must see movie. In my college days, I've read Hamlet with great interest and written essays on it in which I had put a lot of creative effort. So now to see how brilliantly the director and the actors have portrayed Hamlet in an Indian context was truly a marvelous cinematic experience. This is a must see movie! Everyone's acting was great, but I particularly liked Shahid Kapoor, Tabu and Kay Kay Menon's acting. The seen where Shahid Kapoor acts like a mad man in town corner with a plastic radio around his neck - is the best. Also loved the ending - it's in line with Hamlet's original theme but with an interesting twist."
"This is not a simple adaptation, this takes not a simplistic stance; Haider is a remarkable achievement and one of the most powerful political films we've ever made, a bonafide masterpiece that throbs with intensity and purpose.The result is a knockout, a film that makes you smell corpses, that makes you shudder with melancholia, and a film that points accusing fingers. A film that doesn't flinch. Is Haider Vishal Bhardwaj's best film? Vishal Bharadwaj brings alive the ecstasy, pain and passion of Hamlet on screen, he also reminds us of the harsh truth in our own backyard, the man-made mayhem in the God-made jannat that is Kashmir. All this done with his classic poetic touch intact. The second half dips a bit before it picks up again with an unforgettable climax. Please watch this film"
"Haider on of the finest movie after a long run, a must watch for all true cinema lovers and an exceptional acting by Shahid Kapoor,showing his true potential and acting skills,though some of his past releases were not favorable but this time he nailed it and showed what he is capable of.And as for now,till date this would be the movie for which he will be remembered of.And a real appreciation for Vishal Bhardwaj for an outstanding exceptional direction for which he has never been doubted about.And not to forget Tabu,Kay Kay Menon and Irfan Khan for their specific characters,after watching the movie cant even imagine who else would have been a better option. What are you waiting for,go to ticket counter,grab a ticket and enjoy a master piece !!"
"A film that goes on for about 2 and a half hour and yet you do not think for a second of its length. You realize it only when the film is over. Several films have depicted the beauty of Kashmir, but only a few touched the pain lying in the valley. Vishal goes for both, the beauty and the pain. At this age when no filmmakers take a chance to touch the sensitive arena of patriotism, Vishal Bhardwaj and Basharat Peer comfortably takes a hit on AFSPA, making it equivalent to Chutzpa (a Hibru word). It's a brave expression. The story of Haider is built around how the people of Kashmir think, contradictions among themselves, their pain and yet it doesn't disturb you like Anurag Kashyap's Black Friday or something of that sort. Yes, the story is based on Shakespeare's Hamlet, but it's not just a mere adaptation of that story, it has so many ingredients that are very original. The screenplay flows like the nazm of Gulzar, although written by Vishal and Basharat. This is not just a story of revenge, it's a story of helplessness, love, life and rebel. it hits hard on the drama of democracy. Despite being dark, the film remains bright. Exquisite cinematography, Marvelous background score, soul- satisfying music, and excellent individual performance (be it acting or singing) transform this film into an absolute experience. And then the special appearance of Irrfan Khan moves the film into top gear. I was thrilled at the interval, and I am sure, you'll be too."
"this movie is a most awaiting movie of 2014.. a master piece , Acting is very good all the characters of movies play well . Tabu as everybody knows best actress in industry and Sahid Kapoor is one the best actor This movie start well and take time for making story line but after the interval its beyond the imagination . I will not go into plot details, because there is a lot of it. However, a basic one sentence summary is: Haider now has to face his most cunning and intelligent enemy, someone with a real motives... Now that that is out of the way. Haider has done a tremendous job as our beloved Haider , Sahid Kapoor has a flawed personality that hangs on the balance between righteousness . His perception of justice causes an emotional."
"Haider, a take on the Bard's timeless Hamlet, is set in 1998 Kashmir. This is a movie where the personal tragedy of Hamlet's life is seamlessly sewed in with the tragic story of the state of Kashmir. Haider is a story of love, hate, revenge, insanity, possession, belonging, and not belonging.With its grim haunting scenes, its depiction of a dark brooding Kashmir, its sharp dialogue, its frighteningly complex interpersonal relationships, and above all, the breathtaking performances by Shahid Kapoor, Tabu, KK Menon, Irrfan Khan, Shraddha, this is a film that would remain with me for a long time!!!Hats of, Vishal!"
"This is one of a kind movie from Bollywood...Fantastic...Hider has much to offer to fans....I'd say it is something away from those bullshit Bollywood Action, Comedy, Romantic films.A Must Watch...incredible performance and direction.As Hamlet had quite disappeared from our minds so this is a perfect recall.And if you haven't read the novel by William Shakespeare the this is a perfect chance for you... It's also quite different background and settings from Hamlet to Haider as it takes you away from those war movies to the world of guns and gangs....Make Your Choice Now...Go for Haider.."
"For once a bollywood movie doesn't fail to live upto the expectations set. I was really looking forward to watching this movie ever since the trailers were out. It showed a distant promise to a movie buff like myself. And boy was I delighted!!The story telling superbly woven together through a class script, strong and detailed characters and the heaven on earth called Kashmir. Though stated as an adaptation of William Shakespeare's Hamlet, it forced us to look at the Kashmir issue from a different perspective. It asks us to look beyond the nationalist notion- 'my country;right or wrong'. The first half was brilliantly told as the story unfolded amidst the back drop of snow laden mountains of Kashmir. The place is really surreal although the bone of contention between the two nations side it first came into being. The second half begs you to pay close attention to every word, every action and every nuance since there is a delicate play of treachery and blind love at work. They say a woman's heart holds a thousand secrets and here comes our indispensable Tabu. To Haider she is a mother he loves the most and to Khurram, she is a secret lover. The story develops amidst the Kashmir insurgency and puts the laws of the land to question. There are scenes that you are bound to remember for a long time because of the sheer despair of situations, or the acting by the protagonist- Haider. This movie has inspired me to read Hamlet and that is the true indicator of how well the movie was made. I walked out hoping the movie didn't end when it did. Don't go if you want to watch a masala movie or a nonsense 'leave ones brains at home' type of movie. This movie is for genuine Cinema Lovers!!!"
"Such films are extremely rare in the world. One simply can't miss it for ANY reason whatsoever. This film leaves all in shock, melancholy. Every scene in film is absolute stunner and of never miss quality.This film proves that Vishal Bhardwaj (as director) is great as ‪Hitchcock‬, ‪Shantaram‬, ‪BimalRoy‬. He never allows any element of film to grow above the script, though all technical aspects like Cinematography, Costumes, Editing, background score, etc. are of top class and better than any Hollywood classic. Script & Screenplay are perfectly in sync with each other and story as well and it is the razor sharp dialogs of the film that enlighten Shakespearean feel in film. Choreography of song ‪Bismil‬ is never seen before and mind blowing.Music is stunningly melodious. Bismil, Aao Na are chart busters but Jhelum & Aaj Ke Naam are true gem.‪ShahidKapoor‬, ‪KayKayMenon‬ & ‪Tabu‬ have given their career best. This is an out and out Vishal Bhardwaj film, Equally superb in Script Writing, Screenplay, Dialog writing, Music & singing."
"2014 When films transmute William Shakespeare's poetic imagery and the atmosphere that his verses conjure into re-imagined, re- contextualized visuals, and not merely reproduce the action with select dialogs, a movie adaptation of a Shakespeare play can be considered successful. That is why, thought British film scholar Roger Manvell, Shakespeare often translates best in what he considered ""foreign films"". The setting is one of the reasons Haider, Vishal Bhardwaj's adaptation of Hamlet, works. It is true to the haunting ambiguity of the characters' motives in the original play, Shakespeare's most opaque of tragedies, but the Kashmir canvas is potent. Bhardwaj's visual intelligence and the screenplay by Bhardwaj and Basharat Peer, one of India's acute commentators on Kashmir, his home state, add to the effective localization. Shakespearean purism aside, Haider is a thrilling film. It is a film of luxuriant paranoia. It is about Oedipal love. Unlike the cardboard insurgency imagery or images of damaged beauty that soak most films about Kashmir, Haider is an unflinching take on the Kashmir malaise, the tragedy infused with a sense of dark humor about the ordinary Kashmiri's hopelessness. Compared to Bhardwaj's earlier two Shakespeare adaptations, Maqbool (Macbeth) and Omkara (Othello), both of which depended heavily on language and dialogs and used Shakespeare's stories rather conveniently to propel the plot, Haider is a quieter yet richer spectacle and a convincing standalone piece. Bhardwaj chooses bold strokes over gloomy introspection, and in that sense, Haider is in the tradition of mainstream Hindi cinema. The vectorization of songs is riveting to watch (Pankaj Kumar's cinematography is breathtaking throughout, and especially in the songs) and the songs are some of Bhardwaj's best compositions as a music director in recent times. The melodrama towards the end loosens the narrative and the last half hour feels like a bit of a drag, again a typical affliction in Hindi films. The protagonist is far from the melancholy Dane; Haider, which Shahid Kapoor plays with impressive zest and inventiveness, is more a dashing, combustible figure than a brooder. Bhardwaj also does away with the supernatural horror so integral to the original play, and which can be an easy tool for creating suspense and drama in cinema. The horror is in the everyday macabre reality of death, loss and waiting, and in the manipulation of a Kashmiri Muslim's emotions and insecurities. Haider (Kapoor) arrives in the Kashmiri village he left long ago to study at Aligarh after his father, a doctor, has disappeared. His mother Ghazala (Tabu) is romantically close to his father's younger brother (Kay Kay Menon). Arshi (Shraddha Kapoor), his childhood sweetheart, is torn between her pro-Indian establishment family and Haider, who is devastated to see his mother's sudden transformation. His idyllic childhood with parents seemingly in love is shattered. When Roohdar (Irrfan Khan), a mysterious man with a limp sends him a message from his lost father, Haider is on a destructive path of jealousy, hatred, turmoil and doubt. Central to the story is the relationship between Ghazala and Haider— a tender as well as anguished bond between mother and son, fueling the film as essentially an Oedipal drama. The romantic love between Arshi and Haider is almost a sweet afterthought. The casting ideas work impressively well. Kay Kay Menon stands out as a superbly calculating man, the villain in Haider's mind, and Tabu makes a heart- rending Ghazala. Shraddha Kapoor delivers an earnestly fervent performance and Irrfan Khan is pitch perfect as a quietly menacing presence, the only personification close to a ghostly apparition. Salman Khan is here too, in a deliciously manufactured ode to the Hindi film hero through Salman and Salman, Haider's friends and a pair of all-round crooks, an interesting replication of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern from the original play. Haider is an immensely effective re imagination of Shakespeare—and the film's biggest triumph is that the provincial, in this case Kashmir and the characters defined by its reality, shine in a universal and timeless tragedy"

"Vishal is one of my Fav. directors. His Omkaara and Maqbool are my fav movies. I respect his film making a lot and wish there were of his kind in Bollywood. I have liked Shahid in past, esp in Kaminey. Although he makes wrong choices in his movies but when I found he would be in Haider, it made me happy. I don't think we have any praise left for Tabu, KK and Irrfan. They are marvelous. Now Haider! Well I have seen Hamlet, as Kenneth Branagh comes pretty close to actual play. Its such a mammoth. I love Hamlet's soliloquy and thats what makes Hamlet good for me. Now Haider has that missing and whatever little was there was a bit disjointed. Initial part of movie is pretty weak, Shahid's performance in first half is very ordinary. Things change in second half, and Shahid has done a splendid job. Movie suddenly gets on with business and breathes again. I did not find Haider's descent into madness that convincing at all. I think VB still bit a more than he could chew. In past he has done brilliant and perfect job of taking these plays and making them even better and more desi. But this time, it did not work that well. So I have rated movie at 6/10, although 6.5 but that was not possible on this IMDb scale. Btw best thing about movie was Bismil song and Aao Na, I wish there were more of these."
"Vishal Bhardwaj should seriously change his surname to 'Bard'waj, he's undoubtedly an artist par excellence. I always knew his artistry is somewhat distinct, be it his music or his films but I didn't expect it to be my best Bollywood experience. The goosebumps after the film got over stayed with me till I got up today. Haider inspired me as an aspiring filmmaker, not just inspired, but made me question myself: ""If this is filmmaking, do I really have the potential to create something like Haider?"" Hamlet is Shakespeare's longest play with over 4,000 lines and it's one of the toughest ones to adapt, but the way Bhardwaj has done justice to it, it deserves a standing ovation. Recreating the magic and setting it up in Kashmir, who would have thought? Highlighting the inhumanity of the Indian Army on Kashmiris, who would have thought? Equating and chutzpah, who would have thought? You need balls to talk about such issues in a country like India. What a brave chutzpah!Pankaj Kumar's eyes helped us see Kashmir in the minutest form and his cinematography is the backbone of this film. Haider is like a painting, a moving painting. It moves for 162 minutes and creates magic. The musical play in the form of Bismil is one of the highlights. The beautiful lyrics by Gulzar were enough to convey and depict what the film had to.This film would have fallen flat if there was even a single glitch, specially in terms of its performances. But that can't happen if you have a casting director like Mukesh Chhabra. Bhardwaj played with the characters so beautifully that I'm sure Shakespeare would've been proud to watch this rendition. Sumit Kaul and Rajat Bhagat, as Salman 1 and 2 played Rosencrantz and Guildenstern from Hamlet and Bhardwaj placed them so brilliantly that they really managed to leave an impact. Another thing: Salman Khan's presence always works, be it directly or indirectly. Narendra Jha, as Dr. Hilal Meer played Hamlet's father and he is so poetically endearing that it makes your heart cringe, after you get to know about his brother's tricks. Irrfan Khan has a 'REALLY' short appearance, as Roohdar (the ghost identity from Hamlet), but is he good? Or IS HE GOOD? His screen presence, dialog delivery and versatility-when these three things come together, there's magic on screen. Though he had a short part, his character was one of the most important ones. He's his usual best. Aamir Bashir, as Arshia's brother played Laertes and Ashwath Bhatt, as Zahoor (the militant) played Fortinbras:Both were perfect. Lali Parimoo, as Arshia's father and Polonius from Hamlet had a really important bit too. He's an experienced actor who slipped into the character perfectly and is brilliant. Shraddha Kapoor, as Arshia and Ophelia from Hamlet is magical. Finally the actor in her is out. Her beautiful eyes speak more than her. The innocence of her character, the fun and caring Arshia, it all came out well and the scene when she's devastated after her father's demise: Shraddha does magic. Her best till date! Kay Kay Menon, as Khurram and the evil Claudius from the play is class apart. It's a well known fact that Menon is one of the most underrated actors but he never got his due. Haider should put a break on that, as Menon has outdone Claudius by making him his own. The versatility and confidence Menon shows, it's horrific-in a good way. The last shot of Haider would chuckle your bones. Shahid Kapoor, the Hamlet-the Haider is decent. He's decently superlative. He's decently one of the best actors of our generation. He's decently better than the rest. You see Pankaj Kapurin him, you see the passion in him, and you finally see the 'actor.' Hamlet is an actor's dream; it's the toughest character to portray. This one character has so many shades to it and Shahid outdoes himself in each and every frame. From his diction to his body language and his 'bloody-fucking intense' eyes, he literally lives Hamlet and it shows. He's not just a good-looking man who dances like a star, he's an actor-he's an artist. Saved the best for the last-Haider wouldn't have been this without Tabu. She plays Ghazala, Haider's mother-Gertrude from Hamlet. The mother in dilemma! Ghazala has many traits to her, but at the end of the day she's a very caring woman. Tabu takes this to another level. She loves two people who dislike each other and wants to satisfy both, hence the conflict kicks in. Tabu is THE BEST thing about Haider and trust me, she understood each and every nuance of Gertrude and played it with perfection. Although Haider has shades of Oedipus complex, Bhardwaj has smartly toned it down-keeping our audience in mind, but Tabu and Shahid have played that bit so wonderfully that it's unreal.Vishal Bhardwaj and Basharat Peer have written Haider so beautifully that even though there are many changes in Haider and most importantly the end, which is gut wrenching. Revenge creates revenge and revenge is not always the solution, how beautifully has this been portrayed? Haider's love for his mother overpowers the hatred he had for his uncle and that moment defines art. A tear swept down. Goosebumps, yes! And the dark humor has been incorporated brilliantly. From the Salman-Salman to Arshia's English accent to the scene where Roohdar fools a random man who wasn't going inside his house to even the graveyard sequences, where we see a beautiful version of 'Aao-Na.' And the last scene, after the blast-when we see those destroyed human bodies and the cut off hands-RESPECT.And for the people who feel Haider is 'copied' from Hamlet: It's an adaptation of a play, which is a part of literature. So yes, Vishal Bhardwaj is an artist, a gem and Haider is one of the best films I've seen till date. Kudos to UTV, who had the guts to produce this masterpiece."
"To comment or not to comment? thats the question. Will i be able to compose words to write a review of a movie by the maestro. Well i am gathering courage and joining IMDb as a user to comment. i find myself out of words and kind of humiliated as I am not able to put my thought into lines. Well in nutshell , Haider is magic. Its the perfect portrayal of Shakespeare's poetic beauty in to a chilling and burning Kashmir of 90s. The movie stirs you from inside and even when you are out of hall , you are wandering into Kashmir, facing their problems and experiencing their fear. I have been a fan of out of the box movies and Haider is a rare piece of art in Indian Cinema. the cinematography is perfect. it bounds u till the end and the music score keeps on echoing in Your ears. And what can i say about acting of Tabu ji. She is the empress when it comes to performance . Kay Kay Manon and Irafan were upto their names as usual. But the person who steals your heart is Shahid . i personally never expected this class from him .Undoubtedly the best role he has ever portrayed and must be thankful to VB for giving him the opportunity of Portraying the troubled mind of Hamlet as Haider. if omkara and maqbool were plausible haider deserves a standing ovation. Go and watch it"
"This is a great great film! You really need guts to make a movie like this in India. The cast, plot, direction ... everything was up to the brim. You can't ask for a better one really. Shahid Kapoor just knocked it out of the park, Shraddha fit right in it, her innocence and her voice is just majestic. Imran and Kay Kay Menon did their part really greatly! And Tabu, she is brilliant man! Everyone in this film must admit that this is the best film/work of their career. Vishal Bharadwaj again proves that he's the only one of his kind. I didn't find anything wrong in this film to give it a rating anything less than 10! Go and Watch it! Don't miss it!"
"Haider is rare film that will go down in cinematic history as a bold move that detaches Kashmir from the its usual depictions and dares to lay it bare. Talks of ghost ids, demilitarization of the state, the plebiscite that never happened are all issues mainstream cinema probably have never even heard of. Bhardwaj conjures up a heart wrenching tale of betrayal, loyalty, love, angst, pain and a man torn between them all. I am sure no one except Vishal could have stayed so true to Hamlet and made something so different from it. The performances are top notch but what works the best about Haider is its unpredictability. Even if you are fluent with Hamlet, there will be a lot you can take away from Haider. I guess, this film is the best all those who are associated with it can get. Haider is an unforgettable film that never fumbles, never stumbles, and is so sure of itself that it cannot go wrong. From Shahid to Tabu to Kay Kay to the powerful cameo of Irrfan, everything in the film works. It's a Guztaq film that audaciously breaks every rule in the book, everything that you could have expected from it and ends up being that edgy watch which you'll savor, while you watch it from the edge of seats. Performances. When it comes to performances, everyone is on the same page in this film. Shahid Kapoor brings out his genetic brilliance and gives an ace performance Shraddha Kapoor as Oephilia or Arshiya as in the film, is great. Beautiful, innocent and smooth. Tabu brings her own to Gertrude. She plays Ghazala with flair and have a haunting quality to her silence. When her son tells her she has two faces, the heartbreak shows on her face. Her beauty is such in the film that it reflects her state of mind. Kay Kay Menon is far away from his last few stints and gives Claudius (Khurram) his own color. I loved how his demeanor shifted in the presence of different people."
"Simply put: Do not see. Or see it. Or see it on TV later. This film is not worthy of such discussion.FOR THE PEOPLE FROM KASHMIR (1). For people from Kashmir, who are looking for some authenticity in the storyline; I am sorry to say that the situations are mostly contrived. The objective is to create pathos for the hero of the film. So, the army is shown as the aggressor in a vacuum and its actions as the instigators for the common man. Many times, the people who fund such propaganda/ political movies have their own agendas and it appears to be very much the case here. There are other objectives and those are from the political leanings of the well-known, separatist-sympathizing, script-writer Basharat Peer. (2). In reality, the anti-terrorist local force, Ikhwan was made more from the people who had been wronged by the terrorists and not from turncoat terrorists. The cause and motivation of these Ikhwanis is not explained as such. The horrors and miseries of the terrorists (many of them being non-Kashmiris from Pakistan and Afghanistan) upon the common man and women, which created Ikhwanis, are not shown. Ikhwanis are shown as mercenaries under the guidance of the Army but Ikhwanis were actually the ones who had earlier been wronged and tortured by monster terrorists and that was their motivation against them. In the film, this Ikhwan-Ul-Muslimeen is deliberately called the Ikhwan-Ul-Mukhbareen. The subtlety in changing the nomenclature should not be lost on you if you are from Kashmir. The History of Kashmir and the names of places in Kashmir are being rewritten with an agenda and the story of the Ikhwan-Ul-Muslimeen seems to have been rewritten with the same agenda. (3). For Kashmiri Hindus, half a million of whom were forced into mass exodus, there is barely any mention and no background is provided about them. The script writer/ movie maker sees that if it was done, you could not develop pathos for any terrorist and Haider eventually is just a terrorist. (4). In the future, if a writer were to actually weave all the subplots (Kashmiri Hindus, What the army was up against, Torture of Locals by the Terrorists, Reasons for the Ikhwan, Role of the rich and the famous and the well off from among the Kashmiri Muslims .) into the narrative, it will be a hell of a story. Haider is not.FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE THE BACKGROUND ON KASHMIR (I will stick to facts) (1). There were 2 rows occupied in the entire hall. 1 row was occupied by people of Kashmiri origin and their friends. (2). The people in the row behind the Kashmiris were fidgety after the first 20 minutes of the movie. They would walk out and walk back in. I am not sure how many stayed for the length of the movie. (3). The story is supposed to be adapted from Hamlet. During the portions of the movie that touch the Hamlet storyline, one could only hear guffaws and lack of inclination towards the film. (4). During what should have been the most touching scenes and songs, people kept casually leaving their seats to fetch popcorn, to ease their heads, to take a break (5). After the movie, during the follow-up dinner, I asked some of the non-Kashmiri friends what they thought of the movie. They are open-minded, liberals and what you will call very secular. They did not believe the storyline was as much about Kashmir as it was about Haider and his conflicting/ unclear emotions for his mother and her undeclared, under the covers relationship with his uncle. Unfortunately, this portion of the story and the inter-relationships of the people were not developed well because the script-writer/ filmmaker chose to cover the Kashmir issue way more than required. The movie therefore became a hotchpotch. Even without any background, the non-Kashmiri people in the audience did not believe that the story was anywhere close to the truth. It was just their feeling about the story, even if it had been fact. The problem was that the script-writer/ film-maker tried too hard to thrust their emotion on the audience and that fact had not been lost. Think of a salesman trying too hard to sell to you and your reaction! (6). Their rating for the movie ranged from 1.5 to 2. They said that if they did not know that it was based on Hamlet and if it was an original story, they may have rated it 2.5.CONCLUSION This movie is not a game-changer or a piece of history for anyone. You can safely watch it now, ignore it, watch it for free on TV later, save your time and do something better ..(1). It will not appeal to the young Muslims because they know that it is not the truth. They are up against an incredible amount of propaganda anyway and if they have to be affected, it will be due to that propaganda than due to this movie. (2). The Kashmiri Hindus will know that this is a lop-sided story. They should not worry that general people (other Indians, an international audience  ) will believe in this being a statement of truth. (3). The remaining audience finds the movie to be only moderately entertaining (for art, visuals, drama, suspense  ) but certainly not a reflection of truth."
"Wasted my 3 hours by watching this idiotic movie. 10/10 For Kappor's acting but story line will just make you sleep. I can not believe the concept behind the movie. Movie is about how to make free JK from India and how Indian army behaves with all JK , which is not true.. I would say it is AntiIndiaArmy movie. KK Menon and Irfan khan also acted well as per given roles in movie. Tabbu was just awesome in all over the movie but movie was flowing very slow without any shocks at specific points which is the sign of getting bored!! I could have given more rating for overall acting but the concept which was so burning as being part of the country , i can not accept it."
"I watched the movie but could not find one good mention of following things :1. Indian army loosing its soldiers. 2. Kashmiri hindu pandits beaten and murdered and thrown out of kashmir. 3. India provids kashmiri people at least a fair opportunity to work around India which is a blessing. 4. Good things done by government. 5. Bad things done by fundamentalist organizations in kashmir funded by Pakistan.It depicts India as an enemy to kashmir while kashmir acted as enemy to India in many situations. Even in recent flood rescue operation when Indian army was distributing relief they pelted stones on Indian army. And after all when there is a 5 decade long tension in a area where army need to maintain high surveillance all the time around kashmir to protect it there will certainly be problems. If we genuinely want to solve the problem or put balm on the wounds of kashmiri's we need to make movies which may inspire their population to do something new, bring innovation and change the life. This is not at all a correct depiction which brings any good thing for the society. Rather this may help many go radical and take the path of bad. Just after this movie we are now seeing ISIS flags in kashmir. Is this bollywood directors gifting their country, shame on team haider."

"Let's get straight to the point,Haider is NOT your daily dose of bollywood meal.It's something unique,it's something that touches your soul and keeps your mind occupied well after you have left the cinema.Being an adaption of William Shakespeare's Hamlet,Haider is set in Kashmir in 90's.It's by far the best political drama ever in bollywood.The cinematography is breathtaking,the dialogues are outstanding.And the music is well suited to the theme of the film,haunting and touching.Shahid Kapoor plays the lead role and he has outdone himself as an actor.Tabu,kk Menon,Shraddha have given splendid performances.Director Vishal Bhardwaj has delivers a cult classic.Watch Haider if you want to experience true cinematic brilliance..I will give it 9.5 out of 10"
"As viewers, we don't get to watch many sensible movies in India. Movies like Haider should not be missed as it is not a DVD-Watch stuff. It is very difficult to portray a Shakespearian drama into an Indian Setup. For Vishal it is not a big deal as he has done it thrice Completing the Shakespearian trilogy successfully.Shahid Kapoor proves that he is the son of great Pankaj Kapoor by giving us a powerful performance. Tabu played a heartbreaking yet a deceptive woman. Kay Kay Menon's performances was outstanding. Irrfan's cameo was a treat to watch. The two salman guys did a great comic part. The remaining cast, along with the lovely Shraddha Kapoor, did a fantastic job.The ending was quite different from original Hamlet drama, which I wouldn't be disclosing. Give yourselves some time to watch this beautiful movie with seductive poetic dialogues about love, politics and revenge."
"i am a big Shahid Kapoor fan but i am afraid that it won't do well because Indian audience don't like these type of movies and then they blame producers and filmmakers for making some $h!t  but one thing for sure this movie will win the hearts of true cinema lovers hats off to Shahid, Tabu and Vishal sir for giving us this gem. excellent casting, cinematography, screenplay and direction, everything was perfect. Shahid deserves national award for this. Tabu was the soul of the movie, Irfan was so good in that short role that you can't think of any one else for that role. Kay Kay was so good, Shradhha was decent. Everything seems perfectly placed. Please don't miss this gem."
"The movie ""Haider"" proves that Bollywood has evolved and that India has now some bold filmmakers like Vishal Bharadwaj. This outstanding movie with a mind-blowing performance by Tabu deserves 10 stars, but I am holding one star because the movie fails to come off as unbiased and the movie could have done with better editing and zero romantic songs. First, the movie shows a realistic Kashmir - this is not the heavenly Srinagar of old Hindi movies, and the movie realistically depicts one of the problems that the people of Kashmir face. But here the movie should have balanced opinion in order to appear neutral. While the movie clearly shows things as seen with the eyes of terrorists or budding terrorists (Roohdar and Haider) and makes a case for these people to dislike Indian Army, it fails to explain why the Army has to resort to the measures that it does. The movie does not explicitly show the murders and the guerrilla war that the Army has to suffer at the hands of the terrorists. Even when the Army arrests Haider's dad, the doctor, for harboring terrorists in his home, the movie provides the counter-argument that the doctor is on ""life's side"". We then go on to see one of the primary characters, Haider, turn against the Army in search of his dad - and there is little ambiguity here - the filmmaker clearly wants you to sympathize with Haider. The only thing to the movie's credit in this matter is the message of peace borne by the protagonist Ghazala - yes, Ghazala, and not Haider, is the true protagonist of the movie because she plays the upper hand in all events including the climax - Bharadwaj has shifted the center of gravity of Shakespeare's play from Hamlet's dilemmas to Gertrude's mind.Screenplay is mostly perfect but slips at a few places. One of the strongest points of the movie is its ending. The screenplay puts a surprising twist to the Shakespearean drama. In a way, this is the movie's way to try to balance the case it has built for violence and revenge.Direction and cinematography are superb. Editing is also good, except the romantic songs, whose presence in the movie, first of all, I do not know the reason for, but worse, which have been inserted into the movie at the most unfitting moments. They actually end up making the viewer impatient instead of providing any respite.I would give primary credit for the movie to the performances, and above all, to Tabu. Ghazala is heart-breaking and her eyes and facial expressions speak volumes. Lending her full support is Kay Kay Menon in a highly convincing villainous Kashmiri role. Shahid Kapoor, as Haider, is exceptionally good in the second half of the movie, but not so convincing in the first half. The only weak link in the cast is Shraddha Kapoor and clearly stands out as an under- performing novice among veterans - fortunately, she has pulled off her last scene well - which is where her character really matters.All in all, ""Haider"" is a must-see Bollywood affair. It will leave you deeply moved and make you think. However, remember that the movie succeeds in making the case for only one side of the full picture, the main reason it loses one star in my rating."
"Well I have not read Hamlet but I know that this adaptation of novel from Vishal Bhardwaj is the best flick I have seen till this date.Good dialogs, good direction, nice storyline and the best part- it showcases Kashmir very well. The scenery is very nice and also compliments the storyline. A Must Watch...but Not recommended for children because it contains some violent scenes and dialogs(like almost every movie of Vishal's). Tabu has acted very well although Shradhha looks way similar to the way she acts in every movie. Shahid has also done a good work. A good display of Politics and terrorism. Every actor justifies his/her role well."
"Haider is a brilliantly acted and photographed movie which used classic scenes from the play and made a picturesque collage out of it. It does not confirm to the play, still the spirit of the play is intact, although a few more soliloquies would have been great. It is not and I didn't expect it to be a documentation of Kashmir issue, although it does have them as a background. It is about Haider and Ghazala. A special mention of Pankaj Kumar, the cinematographer, who again delivers a gem after Ship of Theseus. Shahid does the best work of his life. Tabu and Kay Kay are as brilliant as they always have been and Irffan as well will be remembered for his cameo. The poetry of Faiz Ahmad Faiz and Gulzar mixed with Vishal Bhardwaj's music will remain in your mind for a long time. Also the background music is as haunting as the interpretation of the ghost scene. The best movie of the year has arrived."
"The movie tells the story of Haider (Shahid) who finds out that his peace-loving, life-saving doctor father (Narendra Jha) has been arrested by the Indian Army. He returns from Aligarh (where he was studying poetry, a passion he shares with his father) to realize that his mother (Tabu) and uncle (Kay Kay Menon) are behind a conspiracy that resulted in his father's disappearance.We have seen in Maqbool and Omkara how wonderfully Bhardwaj takes up the bard's plays and weaves them passionately into a completely different cultural milieu. With Haider, Vishal does better. The film paints Kashmir in a haunting colour, so true to the troubles there. The usual whites and dark hues of frames are there in the Valley (usual in cinematic sense when you portray dark emotions) but even the gleeful frames blaringly outline the feelings of revengeful, hurt and disturbed souls.Bhardwaj and Kashmiri journalist Basharat Peer co-wrote the film's screenplay and they must be praised for their courage to speak strongly about what is happening in Kashmir. Haider goes beyond Bollywood's Pakistan bashing for Kashmir's troubles and speaks about the alleged atrocities of the Indian Army on Kashmiris. Haider jokes about 'chutzpah'--pronounced as 'chootspaa' in the movie--and equates it to AFSPA (Armed Forces Special Powers Act, the security law which gives armed forces immunity from prosecution while operating in the militancy-hit areas but has been criticised by human rights groups).As for performances, Vishal Bhardwaj brings out the best of Shahid Kapoor and Shraddha Kapoor, a journalist in the movie. Shahid looks a little out of place in the beginning but the traumatic role rubs onto him with time. Shahid's acting in Haider could well undo his several Bollywood mistakes , Tabu plays the role of a traumatised and hurt soul who is searching for peace and love wonderfully. Kay Kay Menon is mesmerising with his menacing and conniving looks. Narendra Jha is impressive as the doctor who in his bid to save lives ends up being branded as a militancy supporter. Even the smallest of characters, faces that appear just for a shot, impress you as much as the actors with full-fledged roles. In one scene, Shahid meets an old woman at a government office where they have both come searching for their missing family members. The woman shows the picture of a young man and Shahid shows his father's picture: the traumatised-and-caring look on the woman's face as she touches Shahid's head is striking.Bhardwaj picks the drama of human follies from Shakespeare's works and places them in a completely different scenario, but he stays true to the emotions of the bard's works. The director ensures that the emotions of a troubled soul (Haider), subtle sexual undertones of the mother-son duo relation, the eternal human follies of treachery and adultery are showcased on the canvas of his cinema.The music and background score go hand-in-hand with the narrative and scaringly haunt you throughout. The romantic number Khul Kabhi To seems a bit misplaced and is distracting. The ending to the song, however, brings you back to the traumatised cinematic experience that Haider is.Watch the film for Vishal Bhardwaj's direction, dialogues and touching acting prowess that almost everyone in Haider shows. Skip it if an intense, disturbing film is not your cup of tea or if entertainment is what you seek at movie theatres."
"Firstly, I am constantly surprised at the high ratings Bollywood movies seem to garner on IMDb. 8.8 for this, really? That's at par with Schindler's List, Matrix, Forrest Gump and Inception, and this movie is definitely not quite there. I would rate it a 6.5 as an international film, it has some good acting and interesting improvisations, but then its a flawed gem and not quite in a good way.Let's start with the story. It's an ambitious project that seeks to translate the madness and greyness of Hamlet on-screen. Not many directors would be confident enough to take on and experiment with Shakespeare's most- studied and obsessive, self-destructive anti-hero. But Vishal Bharadwaj has been successful with adaptations of Macbeth (Maqbool) and Othello (Omkara) in the past, and, well, Maqbool remains his best work till date. Haider's execution is tame by comparison - a let-down when you consider the explosive pot-boiler of murder, madness, rage, revenge, recklessness, betrayal, blood and incest that the original play offers. The decision to model the decaying state of erstwhile Denmark, and its phase in-between transfer of powers, on Kashmir is double-edged. Kashmir fits, but any storyline with Kashmir will always have to compete with the real-life tragedy of Kashmir - a compelling story of loss and loyalties in itself. Shahid Kapoor as Haider/ Hamlet is simply not good enough to bring focus back from Kashmir and its bleakness. In fact, his performance is easily trumped by Tabu's understated one - and probably not by the director's design. Which does not bode well for a movie with a titular character! Shahid probably gives one of his finer performances till date, but still comes across more as a petulant and confused child out to confound others, than as a young man beset by maddening doubts and suspicions and questioning everything - including himself.The film adds in local twists and tales captured in stark and haunting cinematography - which is a plus point. But then, adding Kashmir to the equation does mean necessarily providing meaningful context to events - which again takes the focus away from the main narrative which ought to have been Hamlet's and Hamlet's alone. The details are sketchy and superficial. The flat political portrayal feels like biased and incomplete propaganda rather than as an atmospheric additive to increase the sense of intrigue essential to the story. AFSPA,'chutzpah' - ah, its even pronounced wrong to make the statement - like the Indian cuss-word, either very clever or very ignorant. To be fair, it is the director's own art and interpretation, even if the film sometimes makes you feel like you are watching two different stories unfurl, bound by a tentative link.The first half is tight and taut, with a promising build-up towards the infamous obsession and reckless violence. However, the second half lets it down thoroughly, with the last half-hour dragging on unnecessarily. There are glimpses of potential, but they don't really deliver. KK Menon and Irfan Khan are quite wasted as actors, and you almost feel annoyed at the director for being such a tease - anyone else could have essayed their respective roles, and without being a bigger talent than Shahid. The doomed love-story (with Shraddha Kapoor), and his brush with the militants till the very end, feel poorly done, with inconsistent plot-flow. Tabu is the best thing in the movie, even in the most incongruous bits, and totally owns every frame she is in. With a storyline as intense as Hamlet's, a backdrop as dramatically evocative as the 90s' militancy-riddled Kashmir, and a great ensemble of actors - well, as a viewer, I would have expected a lot more. Not a bad watch on a big screen, but there are much better films out there. Yes, 6.5 it is and no more."
"The soldiers move around with INSAS rifles in the movie set in 1995 when these weapons were introduced only in 1997. The vehicles used by the Indian Army in 1995 were not the ones soldiers use in the movie. The stars on the collar dogs for Brigadiers and above were introduced in 2000s and a Brigadier (portrayed by Ashish Vidyarthi in the film) couldn't have worn them in 1995. Indian Army didn't have a RPG-7 in its inventory and the RL-84 Rocket launchers that it used never set buildings to fire.Contrarily, Amjad Rasheed, owner of Distribution Club, previously known as IMGC Entertainment, shared why the film wasn't taken to provincial censor boards for clearance after it was refused certification from CBFC. ""We realize the gravity of the situation at the Line of Control and if one board has refused to certify the film, then the wise thing to do is not to offer the film at all,"" said Rasheed, whose company was set to import Haider in Pakistan.The contradiction in comments from CBFC and the film's distributor suggests that the film wasn't going to be released in Pakistan in the first place. That the delay in bringing Haider to Pakistan could have been an orchestrated move on part of the Distribution Club, which also distributed box-office behemoth Bang Bang and spy-thriller Operation 021. With Bang Bang's high commercial quotient and Operation 021's 'Shaan' factor expected to supersede Haider's intricate narrative, the film would have not generated sufficient collections at the box office had it been released at that time. The distributor's interest in releasing Haider two weeks late could have dwindled further due to the film being readily available on DVD and played on cable television throughout the Eid season."
"Indian Army continues to face bullets from enemies and abuses from family. Today, on one side Pakistan is targeting Indian Army and minority locations in Kashmir with bullets. And around the same time, our own country-men create a film like ""Haider"" that paints Indian Army a villain.On one hand, flags of ISIS are waved in Kashmir, and at same time, ""critics"" laud anti-nationalism of Haider as marvel of art.Such co-incidences give ample evidence that somehow our enemies and certain elements from within our country consistently orchestrate great timing and coordination among each other that it is hard to believe that it was just a mere coincidence.Army silently sacrifice Themselves for nation. Whom are they fighting for? Whom are they defending? The same people who could make this film because of Army's protection collude with an anti-national Jihadi writer to make a villain of Indian Army? Is this the reward of their sacrifices that they continue to make? Are commercial gains and so-called artistic expression more important than motherland and humanity?"
A very well directed movie with brilliant performances by all the star cast.-'Bismil' song is one of the best thing that this movie has got with so much liveliness. -Shahid this one's the best of you till date.-Irfan khan is best as always. -Tabbu's performance shows what senior actresses are capable of doing. -And finally K.K. you are one of the diamonds that Bollywood has got.It is different genre movie which everyone might not like. IF you want masti mazaa and masala go for some other movie.
"Since the trailer of Haider is out it has created a mass hysteria. The audience has a lot of expectations from Haider because of its brilliant star cast including Shahid Kapoor, Tabu, Kay Kay Menon, Shraddha Kapoor and Irrfan Khan. On the other hand, Haider is also most anticipated movie of the year because it is the third Shakespearean adaptation by Vishal Bharadawaj. Vishal has proved his mettle with likes of Maqbool, The Blue Umbrella, Omkara and Kaminey. No doubt, Vishal has a robust hold over what he is doing. Will Haider live up to expectations? Will Shahid give his career's best in this movie? Will Tabu heat up the proceedings of movie with her anguish and charisma? Let's analyze.Vishal, as the director, is the lifeline of Haider. Without Vishal's directorial finesse Haider couldn't have been the experience that it turned out to be now. Screenplay of the movie is pitch perfect without any loopholes. It couldn't have been better. The writers have transformed the idea on paper into a visually splendid movie with superlative script. The dialogues penned by Vishal strike the right chord. Cinematography is of astounding. The DoP depicts Kashmir in an exquisite way. The locations are breathtaking. The music by Vishal is soul touching. Songs like Aao Na and Bismil steal the show. Aao Na is just too melodious. Bismil has all the elements to be a chart buster. Overall, the album is exceptional and distinctive. Tabu comes into form after 'The Namesake' and 'Cheeni Kum'. She gives yet another scintillating performance. The flair that Tabu has is inimitable. No one could have played the role of Ghazala like Tabu. She owns every frame she appears in. Ghazala's role demands to show distress, magnetism and splendor at the same time. Tabu depicts every emotion with poise. It will not be inaccurate to state that performance wise Tabu is the master of this star cast."
"The spoiler warnings don't really apply to those who've read/heard of the bard's 'Hamlet', or its various interpretations. Going in, I really felt this was being released at the wrong time, being sandwiched between quite a few mainstream flicks, and getting around a 5th of the screens to play on (true that). However, that might turn out to be a blessing in disguise, since many don't plan their movie-watching weekend, and might not get tickets to watch the other crapfests that're screening alongside this one.With everything I knew about this going in, I felt that the milieu chosen was quite inappropriate, since Kashmir, and it's clichés have been done to death, and VB still wanted to set his supposedly final Shakespearean tragedy here (however, to still give him some of the benefit of doubt, he only scored 'Maachis' for his mentor - Gulzar). Talk about being bereft of ideas. Both he and his mentor Gulzar have used, as their muse, both Tabu, as well as Kashmir and its insurgents one too many times, and I guess one is incomplete without the other, even the mentor-protégé combination. Again, not that I'm complaining'. Tabu is the Meena Kumari for this generation, and that's no mean feat in these days of pandering being done by any name-artist worth their craft, where people without a shred of talent are praised for looking good, and looking good alone (c'mon, you know who I'm referring to over here) is sometimes mistaken for acting.To the movie itself now - it looks sumptuous, and you can bet the cinematographer just laid back and let the natural vistas do their job (not to say this would've been easy to shoot by any means). Even for followers of the bard, and audiences of each of the renditions of 'Hamlet', there are a few surprises in store, and that is no mean feat. Quite a bit of credit to the team behind-the-scenes (not all though, since quite a few aspects could've been improved upon – read on).However, the movie clocks in at least half hour too long (with a runtime of 161 minutes, that too with 3 unnecessary full-fledged Bolly-style song numbers, perhaps from some other mainstream masala flick, thrown into the mix - Kenneth Branagh he ain't). Added to that fatal flaw (since he's trying to make converts of those who've not got their weekend mainstream fix), he loses more of the audience by having characters monologue, and repeat other characters' monologues. To me, each time it happened (and yeah, it happens more than once), I had to have switched off, and quite possibly wasn't in the director's corner at all. One of those instances, a character remarks that another antagonist needs to view circumstances from a different perspective, and that gets echoed again). Corniness is also in the mix, with Irrfan Khan's character's name itself. And what was that with giving him a Rajnikanth-style character intro? Another instance where I switched off, and wanted to cheer as well (which is perhaps what VB was going' for, but once again, a fatal mis-step since it changed the tone of the movie unnecessarily). The biggest mistake of all, IMHO, was the overuse and over-reliance on multiple flashbacks (not talking about all, mind you, since doing that would've alienated almost everyone), instead of letting a few things remain unsaid, thereby effectively deepening few mysteries, while also controlling runtime. However, he goes full Bollywood on us, and gets all exposition-y, the same way a mainstream movie helmer would talk down to his/her audience. OK, One more negative, and I'll stop. In these days when TV series are doing great jobs with CGI and stunt-work, as needed, and blend them seamlessly into the narrative and are effective in their context, the final powerful climax, while overwhelming from a characterization perspective, completely underwhelms in implementation, since the effect it needed to have visually, is a whimper rather than a bang, and once again, completely took me out of the movie (which was sad, since the lead- up to it was absolutely fabulous, and I almost had my heart in my mouth). Now that, is kinda typical in most Indian flicks, and goes with the territory, but considering the expectations I place in VB (along with most of his fan-base, I'm sure), was plain sloppy film- making (how they missed it while editing is anyone's guess, and I can only write it off to excessive self-indulgence, which is also characterized by the overlong runtime).Performance-wise, everyone does a bang-up job, including the controversial casting of the lead, who kinda steps up to the faith that VB had in him. No surprise there, since he was absolutely riveting in the superior 'Kaminey' (yeah-huh), the milieu, of which, IMHO, would have been perfect for this interpretation of the bard's tragedy as well. KK Menon, on the other hand, is not given much to do, in terms of something matching up to his caliber, but he's one of the few people who rises up in spite of that (1 sequence with him post-prayer especially) and delivers something solid and praiseworthy. Everyone else has an author-backed role, and thus have the needed support. All in all, while this is NOT Vishal Bhardwaj's 'Omkara' or even 'Kaminey' (some say it was much, much better than his excessively self-indulgent '7 khoon maaf'), it still calls out to be watched on the large screen, hopefully with a patient audience, who're still gonna be disappointed by it all, or come out only remembering the unorthodox/atypical Oedipus shenanigans. You can bet its much better than tons of mainstream crap out there. I don't mind if he re- interprets more of the bard's works out there, heaven knows more of them need re-telling locally. However, I do hope he reads some of the feedback on this one, takes it seriously, and hopefully goes back to the drawing board for his next effort. Seriously."
"What happens when the outlines of Hamlet, is adapted to a clichéd story of revenge, given a poetic touch to the narration, with the setup based in Kashmir, and decorated with the finesse of actors such as Shahid Kapoor, KayKay Menon, Tabu, ? - It becomes a masterpiece called ""Haider"".The story is the same revenge saga, with a guy searching for his father being accused as a militant and taken away by the Indian military, presumably to be dead. And the quest of Haider to take a revenge from his father's killer.So far nothing great. But its the narrative, detailing, intensity, acting of the actors, background score, and dark humor which stands out.Right from the first frame itself, it gives you a feeling that its going to be a spectacular treat at least. As the movie progresses, you are engrossed into the story, so much so, that you don't realize that it's interval. Till here you have already seen the soul of the movie - the real Kashmir and the real life situations of Kashmiris which is a part and parcel of their daily lives. So much so that a person stands outside his house and only enters when someone asks him to show his identity. Its both humorous as well as thought provoking, only showing how much they are habituated of these things. After all this, you start thinking that now the movie will get boring from here.But it ends up being the opposite, with the movie only progressing towards being even better. If first half is about Tabu, Kaykay Menon, and Irfan Khan; second half is only and only about Shahid Kapoor and his acting finesse. Definitely Vishal Bhardwaj knows how to extract full potential from Shahid. It's his best performance till date - he has easily evolved from being a innocent Kashmiri, to a menacing militant. The beauty of his role is that unlike typical movies he is menacing, yet hasn't shed blood until the last 15 minutes of the movie.Shradha has nothing more to do except few intense scenes with her father and brother. Special mention must be for an unknown actor ""Rajat Bhagat"" who has copied Salman Khan at its best - his style of picking the phone, his style of flipping his hair, every little detail of his. Every time he comes on screen, the audience is all cheers. Even for the three actors who dig graves and sing ""Are aao na, so bhi jao na"" - such a humorous yet poetic scene.But beyond all this, the soul of Haider lies in showing us the real face of Kashmir. It compels one to think twice who is gaining in between all these endless fights, protests, revenge. The movie does not want to favor either the militants or the Indian army. All it conveys is that ""seeking revenge in return will only make things worse and cyclic, and it must stop from either side"".Even the climax is symbolic where Shahid leaves his father's killer alive with his legs amputated. It only reflects that rather than taking life, sparing someone with a permanent scar is the worst revenge one can take. Bloodshed is not the only solution.VB has certainly taken Indian cinema to a new height."
"It's Kashmiri Sons of Anarchy, right? What is this Hamelt of which people speak? Just kidding, it's Hamlet, right down to the talking plastic skull. Due to the subtitles, it's even easier to understand in Hindi than in Shakespearian. In addition to the well-acted drama, I learned a lot about Kashmir just by looking and listening. Despite being an Indian film, the Indian government came off poorly. And after seeing this film and several others, I have but one bit of advice for anyone visiting India - Do Not Mess With The Cops! Well worth your time to watch this."
"As a subtle philosophical tinge that cinema is a powerful tool for political mobilization and mass persuasion, Slavoj Zizek notes beautifully that, ""It doesn't give you what you desire, it tells you how to desire."" Haider is the adaptation of Shakespeare's famous Tragedy Hamlet; and the latest Bollywood movie about Kashmir. Question is whose tragedy is Haider? Why many people waited for Haider to release, and see the latest take of Bollywood on Kashmir? There are two reasons why Haider had generated some curiosity among Kashmiri movie lovers: One, it was the adaptation of a play, the story and plot of which was already known to many literature lovers and Shakespeare fanes. Two, its script was co-written by Basharat Peer and directed by Vishal Bhardawaj; Peer known as pioneering English fiction writer amongst Muslims of J&K, and Vishal a successful director for adapting Othello and Macbeth as Omkara and Maqbool respectively. Basharat Peer––whose memoir Novel Curfewed Night gave him unprecedented popularity as a writer of the 'ordeal' of Kashmir Conflict. More than Bhardwaj's credentials it was Basharat's involvement in the script writing that many envisaged a change in the routine Bollywood rhetoric. Haider is a typical Bollywood feature film, no different from: Gangster, Saheb, Biwi Aur Gangster Returns or Gangs of Wasseypur. It doesn't offer anything on the reality of 'what' is happening inside (or with) Kashmir. Rather, it makes a serious attempt to showcase how a real struggle can be reduced to a family feud under the garb of (mis-informed) adaptation of a Shakespearean classic. In the midst of its mis-informed adaptation it lets the Zizekian tinge (of how to desire) creep in. Film adaption as a derivative work needs to be creative so that the ""thin red lines"" between the original and its adaptation are respected. An adaptation needs to take care of the background, which forms its foundation–––more so when the background is highly political and sensitive setting like Kashmir. In a new backdrop and setting it needs to take note of minute details such as culture, historicity, contemporariness, traditions, dialect and so on. The question is how far has Haider been successful in adaptation of Hamlet in a highly political backdrop of Kashmir? Is the attempt artistic or political? If it is political, whose politics does its serve? And why do we need to ask these questions at all? Some Kashmiri friends feel highly obliged that Haider has depicted some fractions of conflict. In a Kafila blog, Suhas Munshi writes that ""for faithfully adapting the violence done to Kashmiris,"" Basharat would have to ""script a pornographic narrative for screen."" The point is not whether Haider succeeds or fails in faithfully portraying the victimhood of Kashmiris from all angles of conflict (structural, political, torture-al etc). This can be a one vantage point to see how far Haider has successfully been able to portray the ordeal of Kashmir that falls within the limits of its frame. And how Basharat ventured to associate the limited frame that forms Haider with its outside–––the power relation(s) that are so central to the familial relations of Haider's characters and yet so distant (and mysteriously absent) from its frame. For the relations between Haider (Shahid) and his uncle Khurram (K. K. Menon), Arshia (Sharddaa Kapoor) and her father Pervez lone (Lalit Parimoo) are not mere personal relations. They have a deep political nature, which Haider has not endeavored to look into. The invisible hand of sovereign amidst these relations is absent in the frames of Haider. Instead the film attempts to cut a slice from these deeply political relations and present it to the audience in an altogether different avatar–––an avatar which reduces a struggle for aspirations and a fundamental right (Right to Self-determination) to a revenge saga.

"Anybody who knows the history of Kashmir & the conflicts within VB has shown one side of the story. Why does it start from 1995 & why not from 1988? There are so many things in the real history which this movie is missing. But that factor which makes a movie great is missing. It has been stretched when VB could have finished the movie in 20-25 min less. The last song sequence is just a burden on the audience, but i like the fact that VB has put some originality like showing the kashmiri roti which is the staple diet of the kashmiris both hindus & muslims. Despite the great acting by all the actors, the movie is an average. Well that's my view of the movie."
"Totally overrated movie.I don't know why people are praising this movie , what is there new in it ?A son who took revenge of his father's dead from his mother.thats the story .i was expecting much more than this movie but i was totally and totally disappointed Bollywood can never take place of Hollywoodwell only a time pass movie , don't expect much morei will only give 3 out of 10"
"This is the worst movie one can watch, glorifying the terrorist who killed thousands of Kashmir pundits in the valley, glorifying the separatist who raped and killed Hindu women and ethnically cleansed Kashmir of Kashmir pundits. A movie which paints Indian army in bad light which recently saved more than 300000 Kashmir People from the worst floods in the history. Thankless Ghetto Movie makersAnyone going and watching this movie will be a Islamic fundamentalist supporter paying to the people in Bollywood who fund ISIS type groups in secret. It should have been banned in India but the corrupt censor board took bribe and passed this gunk onto the people. Save yourself the pain, time money and morality and do not support such terrorist making mockery of Indian Army in the name of art."
"HAIDER a perfectly delivered profound intense dark drama by Vishal Bhardawaj. Shahid is at his best, a speechless portrayal of the art of acting by him also Kay Kay Menon, Irrfan Khan and Tabu form the strong pillars of the supporting cast by their splendid performances. A movie which would be loved by niche audience.VB has created a magical experience on screen and did justice in adapting Hamlet.Decent dialogs, Ravishing cinematography and A witty screenplay. A must watch for all especially for a connoisseur of movies. Shahid must have not charged anything for this film but he sure earned the claps of appreciation as the movie signed off."
"Speechless !!! A most awaited movie which shows loud. Such kind of movies should be awarded... Story is amazing , directed and crafted well. Everyone has done great job. The special thing I caught in this movie local songs which are sung by the cast, which is good way to connect. A very innovative adaption of William Shakespeare's 'Hamlet'. A fine touch story is shown of Kashmir life. Shahid, Tabu, Shraddha and Irfan have played well for their roles. Shahid Kapoor has shown amazing talent . The guest appearance by Irfan Khan is superb. This is the movie which is totally different .... I mean I love this ... Truly awesome work."
"Haider is not a masterpiece or that perfect film that will hound the top hundred list of cinema. But it still should be cherished and celebrated for, keeping in mind the sleaziness that seem to pass off as entertainment in Bollywood nowadays. Even if we remove the poor excuse of Bollywood that I always seem to make to boost the credentials of the movie and see it as an individual identity in the world cinema, Haider has enough to stand on its own feet.As everyone would have known by now that Haider is an adaptation of a play by William Shakespeare, Hamlet that is actually a four hour play and the longest of Shakespeare's plays. It is considered by many to be character oriented than plot driven. Thus, adapting Hamlet has always been a tough nut to crack for many of the filmmakers who have been adapting it since the birth of cinema, and kudos to Bharadwaj for having the balls to do so. And particularly in Bollywood where masala films are the trend. The strain of the monstrosity of the task undertaken is do seen in places where the story becomes shaky, stretched and clunky and particularly with one romantic song that the movie would have done better without.But let us not keep to the flaws, when the good that movie does is just magical and many. Firstly, it is a brilliant integration of the play into the sociopolitical climate of Kashmir that it never seems for once to be a foreign play adapted in Indian settings. And the characters seem as they have always belonged in the beautiful valley. I had my doubts about Shahid being casted as Hamlet aka Haider, but the sheer brilliance of Shahid Kapur melted away all my apprehensions. Tabu unlike the play's Gertrude is given a much meatier character and screen time, and she does justice to it with her dexterity. Bharadwaj has been very bold and it became evident in the first half hour of the movie when in a flashback an adolescent Haider kisses Tabu on the neck and the camera zooms on the gesture. It is then you realise that Bharadwaj is not going to leave out one of the most discussed aspect of Hamlet- Oedipus Complex. And his boldness is shown comradeship in the silent, lingering sensuality of Tabu's character that simmers subtly with the motherly affection and heartbreak. Kay Kay Menon is the sly fox who marries Tabu after the death of the Shahid's father. And he is a phenomenal thespian.The story is set against the backdrop of unrest in Kashmir and the entire story through its characters aim to recount the suffers and toils of its people and the vicious cycle of revenge and violence that seems to spare no one. It is one huge politico-social allegory that not only have direct references to the issues at hand, but also each character serves as an allegory for the players in this game of interminable violence. At the centre of the story there is a complex entanglement of love, betrayal, treachery and jealousy that threatens to tear apart the very peace they wish for. And at the centre of this web is Haider- a poor soul, torn between love, jealousy and revenge and slowly descending into madness.What I love about Vishal Bharadwaj is that he is a man of vision. You can assuredly rest your faith in the fact that his love for cinema makes him unsusceptible to the allures of money and he is going to deliver a cinema that he believes in. The only problem with such people is that they are consumed not with mediocrity, but the unquenchable thirst of their ambition. And the fewer flaws of the movie stem from this. There are many amazing scenes in the movie that are paisa wasool. The song that Shahid Kapur sings, retelling the whole conspiracy, to see the reaction of his soon to be step father is a very brilliantly choreographed scene that is powerful and evocative, true to the nature of play that Hamlet choreographs in the Shakespearean play. The joker Haider plays under the tree was superb one man act. Simply brilliant. The ending scene with snow marred with dead bodies, graves and blood holds an imagery that will stay long with me. The gravediggers scene at the end is surreal and in some way denote the madness that is slowly enclosing Haider, or the impending doom. It was done fantastically. Loved that part.Haider is powerful cinema. The imagery, the sound, the acting, the dialogues all mix to create an experience that is haunting and captivating. Haider was never meant to be entertaining. It is one hell of a head trip into the mind of a state that is plunging deeper into madness, caught in the interminable cycle of hate and revenge."
"what a movie! there was definitely no doubts about how the story would be considering the origins of the script. however, the fact that a volatile actor like shahid kapoor was in the movie, made it a gamble to watch it. ironically, shahid kapoor was perhaps the stock weapon of the movie. he gave a balance to his acting which was previously missing. the movie encompasses the darkness of the era and makes you empathize with the citizens of the princely state. the first half of the movie feels a little glum where the protagonist cries in the starting scenes, however without any connection to the character, it fails to charm the audiences. but with the progression of the movie, the intensity increases and the pinnacle of the movie was the song bismil bismil. all in all a good movie, with an even better suspense. vishal bharadwaj, well done."
"When you take up a Shakespeare story it is bound to have some serious stuff , so does this movie. The movie portrays the kashmir conflict in a very nice manner. You could really feel the tension that the people suffer at the border. The cinematography is quite good. The story line is just awesome and the Tabu and Shahid give top notch performances but still Tabu has a tougher role to play so considering that she was the best among the lot. Kay Kay Menon does not perform upto his standard, but still he is good. Now coming to the bad points which I found a lot but it could be compromised. Basically the initial portions are too melodramatic. The plot advances slowly even without giving proper insight. Those could have been enhanced. Shraddha Kapoor was a serious let down. She would destroy a serious scene with her funny accent. The love song was completely unnecessary that could have been replaced with something more meaningful. The second half was more powerful. With the film changing its tome to more of aggressive nature. The Bismil song was well suited to the scene. I had goosebumps during that song. Sukhwinder Singh hats off for that song. Tabu was simply awesome in the second half. And the end was simply marvelous. As a whole I would ask the people out there to check this movie out because you rarely such heart touching and self examining movies."
"Vishal Bharadwaj loves the Bard. And in his third installment, he raises the bar and delivers on brilliant intense but depressing film.Haider, based on Hamlet is the story of young Haider who comes back home to a war torn Kashmir in search of his missing father. However, soon he realizes that his uncle and mother are happy with way things are and no one is interested in finding his father. When the truth is revealed to him, Haider loses his mind and goes for revenge.Firstly, I loved the way Vishal has written the story and the characters. The movie has several scenes that stand out like Haider visiting his destroyed home, Haider addressing the locals in the market area or the climax. Even the scenes with the supporting cast stand out too. A simple scene where Haider's girlfriend is having lunch with her dad who is the top cop. Her dad sweetly tells her not to hide anything from her after knowing that she contacted some terrorist. Another brilliant scenes is the terrific Irfan Khan performing a body check. Watch it to believe it. And check out the two Salman's who are Salman Khan fans.The movie is like terror ridden Kashmir. Its very beautiful but very depressing when terror strikes. There is a lot of blood and gore in the film. You stop counting bodies and the climax is a bit long which made me restless. This brings me to another point. Vishal has taken the Shakespeare adaptation to another level when compared to the previous two. Hamlet like Othello and Macbeth are tragedies. While the previous two films were excellent, they weren't sad and depressing. Haider towards the end made me feel sad. Even my neighboring folks in the hall were restless and passing comments. Not for Haider but the story itself. I wonder how Shakespeare in his grave would look at this adaptation.The performances are simply outstanding. Narendra Jha, who plays Haider's father is outstanding. I've seen this man on serials but didn't know what a hidden talent he is. Kay Kay Menon as Haider's Uncle and Lalit Parimoo as the top cop are class apart. Irfan Khan has a memorable cameo. And, Shahid Kapoor gives his career best performance as Haider. However, like the previous two adaptations, Haider doesn't belong to the main character. If Maqbool belonged to Pankaj Kapoor, Omkara to Saif Ali Khan, Haider belongs to Tabu. A role just written for her, Tabu performance as Haider's mother left me speechless. Tabu is India's finest and underrated actress. She beautifully portrays a loving caring mother, a neglected wife and women seeking love even if it means going for it to her brother in law. Tabu is class apart and you feel for her character Ghazala.Finally, Haider is not for weak hearted and not for those who want a film that relaxes or entertains them. If you love intense films or the Bard, Haider is a must watch."
"Haider concludes the Shakespearean trilogy of Vishal Bhardwaj after Maqbool and Omkara and it is indeed a fitting finale to this spectacular series of adaptations that Vishal Bhardwaj has made. Don't go expecting a scene by scene retelling of Hamlet because this is after all an ""adaptation"" by a brilliant filmmaker and not a scene-by- scene copy or ""remake"" as normally seen in Indian movies. So he makes the story his own while at the same time keeping true to the spirit of the original. He adds many layers to this complex saga of emotions which draws the viewer in and doesn't let go till the final frame. Spectacular cinematography and soulful music enhance the experience of watching the epic drama unfolding on screen. Story is watertight without any loopholes and the dialogues are pure brilliance. The strongest part of the movie is the acting by the superb star cast. Shahid Kapoor finally gets a role which he deserves and he simply sears the screen with his intensity. Tabu is top-class as always and is the backbone of this movie and proves yet again how much we lose when she does so little work. Kay Kay is also in full form as he shows what a brilliant actor he is when given the right role. Shraddha Kapoor looks the part but has a long way to go in the acting department. Even the actors with less screen time like Narendra Jha, Kulbhushan Kharbanda and ""2 Salmans"" leave a strong mark. And of course, Irrfan Khan in the most sensational special appearance ever. And above all this technical and creative artistry is the Master himself, Vishal Bhardwaj, the director, who oversees this extremely difficult subject and delivers a Tour de Force of a movie."
"Perfect translation of Hamlet. Pretty serious acting by entire cast. This movie has restored my faith in Bollywood. Ingenious translation of hamlet, set against the raw beauty of Kashmir in the background. It also shows what Kashmiri people suffer through due to terrorism etc...but thats a different story.In between the movie may feel a little bit slow but it is just to build the intensity of the story. Also apart from being a serious movie the director VB has put some fun elements from Salman Khan's old movies. For all those who like to see some serious kind of acting, story and direction this is a must watch. This is not a usual b'wood masala movie. This one is pretty serious, describing the Shakespeare's Hamlet in its lucid form, with high intensity."
"Of course the movie is slow. It's a Vishal Bhardwaj movie, what do you expect! But the critics and film makers would enjoy each and every second of the movie. Starting from smooth screenplay to Vishal's perfect direction. To those who wants to watch masala or mass entertainer -.- Please keep away from HAIDER, Not only you people will hate the movie but also suggest others not to watch the movie who might really like the movie. So keep your opinions in your pockets and let people watch the movie by themselves. Coming to performances, Shahid has not only lived the role as Haider but also made his way into our hearts as an amazing actor. Tabu, for a minute or two, people might wonder if shahid really is her son in reality. That doubt in people's heart sure did prove her way of acting. Shraddha is cute (that is all anybody can say -.- ). Irfan has undoubtedly done a fabulous job as well.On the whole, The movie is a must watch for those who loves film-making and a must NO watch for mass audiences. A must watch for Shahid Kapoor fans and a must NO watch for fast movie lovers. P.S - I loved the BGM and the camera angles."
"Haider which is an adaption of the novel Hamlet will bore you to the core. The movie has nothing good to speak about. I'm still wondering why this movie is rated 9/10. As most of the people already know the story, they expect something good with the direction, screenplay and cinematography. Screenplay was not convincing at all and Direction sucks to the core. Cinematography is also poor. The only good thing to speak about the movie is the locations the movie was shot. Shahid Kapoor acted well, but the movie was dragged a lot with unnecessary scenes. People literally fell asleep after watching the first half and didn't turn up for the second half as they have taken enough of it. I expected something great to be happening in the second half, after an interesting interval, but it was the same thing.Haider is a different kind of genre which fails to shine with its poor screenplay, direction and cinematography.P.S. - People please rate the movie genuinely, i'm really shocked on seeing the movie being rated 9/10, whereas much more good movies are being rated only 7-8."
"I'm not a huge fan of Bollywood, except when I'm really forced to watch something. Haider was one of them. Yesterday I watched Haider and I really thought its a film lost in its narrative, a film not clear with its motive. Here are some of my points why I didn't like the film the way everyone's been raving about.1. Overly long film, could have easily edited the part about love story, why the hell would one like to listen to a song where the hero who was just in a maniacal depression due to his father's death, dance stupidly around trees for love, loses the credibility of the whole flow. The scene about he going around searching for his father with flyers is unnecessarily long and over dramatic. The song sequence in Kay Kay and Tabu's marriage was another commercial trapping for a realistic film as this one could have been.2. What was the purpose of the speech that he gave in the middle of the road? The speech seemed like the director deliberately inserted to have a solid impression of Shahid's acting otherwise around 100's of people listening so quietly to a layman is a another Bollywood style where the actor is actually the hero, no matter what.3. The film has many commercial trappings like the time when he's about to kill Kay Kay Menon and the police come at the exact right time and spot, the police spots him in the fire torn building when he's about to cross border at the exact right time and spot. Funnily a country where the police is never on time here co-incidences lead them to them to the points without any prior information.4. Why did Kay Kay not have him caught while he was singing the song and dancing, may be he was mesmerized like everyone else by his moves.The only thing good about the film is Pankaj's Cinematography and Tabu's acting."
"Haider is the third offering of Vishal Bharadwaj's trilogy of Shakespearean tragedies which included Maqbool (Macbeth) and Omkara (Othello). For his final instalment, he adapts what is perhaps the most challenging of the three, viz. Hamlet and sets it amidst an equally challenging setting of the restless paradise of earth, Kashmir, circa, 1995. Its brilliance lies in the successful juxtaposition of various strands of portent conflicts across several planes which belie any solution - those within, inter-personal as well as the smouldering geo-political conflicts - to find common grounds therein.Haider (Shahid Kapoor), a student and poet studying in Aligarh has to hurry to his home in the valley when he receives the news of an army crackdown that destroys his home and also results in the disappearance of his father, Dr.Hilal Meer (Narendra Jha), who was taken into custody by the army for harbouring militants. However, on returning home, he is distraught to find little remorse of the disappearance in his mother Ghazala (Tabu) who appears to be settling down quite well with Khurram (Kay Kay Menon), Haider's uncle and his fathers only brother. Haider sets out on a mission to find his father and unravel the mystery surrounding his disappearance. He is assisted in his quest by his childhood sweetheart and local journalist, Arshia (Shraddha Kapoor). The gentle canter of the plot finds momentum at the halfway mark with the arrival of the mysterious and almost ghostly Roohdaar (Irrfan) who contacts Haider. When he discovers the fate of his father, Haider is consumed by rage and obsessed with revenge.The movie sets a gradual pace through the first half to familiarise the viewers with the simmering situation situation in the valley where the daily living is punctuated by overnight curfews, frequent crackdowns, constant fear of living in the shadow of gunfire, a deep-seated dread of being included in the growing lists of those who have disappeared and a security blanket which choked the life out of this paradise. Vishal Bharadwaj and his co-writer Bhasharat Peer cast an unflinching eye on the valley when the insurgency was active to bring us the images which feel very real.Haider gains immensly from its excellent star cast who provide superlative performances in their roles. Shahid Kapoor brings in his best performance till date to capture a very difficult part of Haider (Hamlet) which oscillates across multiple dimensions of love, loneliness, desperation, sorrow, seething rage to seek revenge, subtle hints of Oedipal complex and being on the threshold of lunacy. He has a simmering presence and emotes well in scenes with minimal dialogue even while nailing those where he morphs into an impromptu performer as in the 'Mike Testing....' sequence. Kay Kay Menon aces the role of Khurram (Claudius) who is devious in seeking recognition and power, yet not entirely lacking in warmth. But, Haider's best performance comes from Tabu who plays Ghazala (Gertrude). She plays a complex role which is mired in mystery; a woman whose heart seems tri-sected between the three men in her life - Dr. Hilal Meer, her husband, Khurram, her brother-in-law and Haider, her son. Or, is she just another helpless woman victim in a valley beset with violence, where survival is at a premium and it is only natural that if you survive the bombing of your home, you just jump into the nearest bomb shelter to preserve your self ? There are moments where she appears to drop her guard and lets her vulnerability seep through as in some of her conversations with Haider. Shraddha Kapoor is radiant as Arshia (Ophelia) who is smitten with Haider and tries to assist him in finding his father.Vishal Bharadwaj also adds memorable minor parts, be it Irffan playing the ghostly Roohdaar who sets the plot into motion or Narendra Jha who effectively underplays his part of Dr. Hilal Meer or the duo (Sumit Kaul & Rajat Bhagat) who play Salman and Salman bringing some stray comic relief in an otherwise grim tale or even the elderly grave diggers.Vishal Bharadwaj appears to be an auteur in fine form here as he morphs his world famous source and transplants it to to the troubled landscape of Kashmir to achieve dual goals of narrating a poignant tragedy even as he makes a hard hitting political commentary of a festering wound that continues to consume and singe many a lives without any signs of healing. He and his co-writer Peer capture the insecurities, distrust, anguish and phenomenal sense of loss which permeate the psyche of generations of residents of what was once a paradise on earth as in the scene where Peer himself displays the deep seated scars of a population living in perennial fear. The beautiful, yet desolate images of the snowy landscapes captured by cinematographer Pankaj Kumar combine effectively with the dialogues, haunting background score and Gulzar's lyrics set to Vishal's tunes to present the mutation of this paradise into a morbid hell for its residents. In fact, Tabu's character of Ghazala could as well be seen as a metaphor for the valley itself which is caught between its allegiance between two blood brothers, shrouded in a mysterious veil of apparent self preservation only to let the vulnerabilities show in a few moments when she reaches out to her son affectionately and protectively. While the picture presents a political commentary that need not be entirely neutral, the essence of the commentary tends to abhor violence for any reason.This is a tour de force in film making as Vishal Bharadwaj marshals his entire arsenal - a fine adaptation, stellar star cast acing well fleshed out characters, superb writing, bewitching cinematography, soulful score and music and much more - to make the boldest political movie of our times to stress that revenge merely begets revenge and can never be a path to seek freedom.Yes, the movie does have its fair share of flaws - a languid pace, for one - just as its characters do.. Yet, just as its characters shine through their flaws, the movie too soars to hitherto uncharted trails.Intense, grim, dense and somber, Haider may not be a movie that would suit everyone's palette, especially those who are faint of heart and yet, if, ""To watch, or, Not to Watch"" is your question, ""Steel yourself and don't miss this MUST WATCH which would haunt you long after you've watched it"" is my most definitive answer."
Haider is well directed movie with top class acting by everyone bgm & cinematography is a bonus. A must watch 👌🙌
"Very nice film. Beautiful locations, story and screenplay. Awesome acting by Shahid and Tabu. Irfan Khan cameo was good too. Shraddha's acting was average. The film deserved more at box-office. Very nice film on Hamlet"
"This movies is complete masterpiece. I mean how they make an hamlet adaptation in current Kashmir scenario is just awesome.
Shahid Kapoor's performance was top notch , while others just fine.
Cinematography looks fascinating , dialogues are widely written.Absolute masterpiece"
That movie has a predictable story but it definitely will keep you attached to it till the end because of some extraordinary thrilling scenes which makes the movie perfect. Now lets come to the cinematography which is surprisingly amazing as a movie of 2014. But i noticed in some scenes the vfx didn't work that well which isn't a big issue tho. You'll surely enjoy the movie which will keep you thrilled and will make you cry because of the wonderful acting of the casts. Shahid did the greatest job in this movie for sure. A must watch movie it is!
"Not every bollywood movie is a mass entertainer. Haider is an excellent example of it.
Adapted from the play Hamlet by Shakespeare brings out the sensitive topic of militants in kashmir and politics around them. It revolves around the boy haider after he comes back to his hometown and faces the situation that turns him into something which he had never expected.
Highly recommended movie with the best performance of Shahid Kapoor so far and the likes of amazing acting of Tabu and Shraddha Kapoor."
The film is amazing especially the acting of Shahid Kapoor and Kay Kay Menon
It is the best mivie.. for Kashmir people and is the people are really get any types of freedom.......They should get freedom from India or Pakistan any of country....because they are also man...Some of people from kashmir are live but...from the site of reality they arenot live....
"Vishal Bhardwaj does an excellent job to convert Hamlet into a Bollywood movie , it's got everything revenge love anger !!! Shahid Kapoor has given his best !! Kay Kay Menon and Tabu are amazing !! Shraddha has a little role but performs it beautifully !!"
"What a film... what a making...music... acting by Shahid tabu shraddha is fabulous..and other all co stars too...
Location is awesome..m"
