"A Wednesday, are among the best - and bravest - films to come out in 2008. Only one word to describe it: remarkable! A Wednesday tells the story of certain events that take place between 2 and 6 pm on a Wednesday in Mumbai. Events that are not on any record.'A Wednesday,' questions the injustice done to the common man, when innocents meet their end, following bomb blasts. The story rests on the shoulders of two stalwarts, Anupam Kher and Naseeruddin Shah supported ably by Jimmy Shergill and Aamir Bashir. As the city police commissioner, Anupam lends the role dignity and he has executed it brilliantly.Naseeruddin Shah steals the show with his character. Jimmy Shergill is every inch the cool guy. Aamir Bashir leaves a mark too. Even the characters of the four militants has been portrayed well, especially Kali Prasad Mukherjee, the main terroristThere is a reason that has been kept a closely guarded secret! There is a reason why this case has no written proof! There is a reason ..... for everything!"
"What can be said about this film? Like many other films made recently, this one is different from the typical Hindi masala flicks (nothing against them, I think they're wonderful), there are no songs, there is no combination of different genres in one film, it is not a three-hour film. It's a simple, small film of one hour and a half, yet it succeeds to depict an entire world in this limited time.The story begins as an ordinary thriller about a common man who calls the police and informs them about 5 bombs he has allegedly placed all over Mumbai, which he'll get exploded if they don't release four terrorists. The way every scene is carried by the director is very impressive and the dialogues are realistic. The film flows as a great thriller as time passes by, but then unexpectedly becomes into a dramatic story as it unfolds the motives of this common man.The film does not want us to side any party, it wants us to understand the consequences of war, violence and hatred. It wants us to understand how it affects ordinary people. The story is not bigger than life, nor does it intend to be one. The fact that Naseeruddin Shah's character is unnamed only contributes to the universal message of the film.There are many sequences of different people shown in different portions of the film which are just amazing. The one when the officer played by Anupam Kher asks the policeman played by Aamir Bashir about his family status, and his willingness to find the bomb. The guy answers that he's married with a recently born baby girl, yet he'll do anything to find the bomb. Another, when Naseer recalls the young nice guy he met every day in the train, the one who was preparing to marry someone, and gets killed the following day at the 2006 Mumbai train bombings. People must get what happens as a result of terror.The characters in this film are very well defined: a great and respected Police Commissioner, an ambitious journalist, a hot-tempered policeman who takes his job seriously, a common man who feels hurt, and many other policemen who'd give their life for the country. The film depicts national pride and the passion different people have for their work without going to large extents and unnecessary melodrama. It's done in a very realistic manner.The entire cast is wonderful, from leading actors to extras. Naseeruddin Shah does not know how to give a bad performance. He doesn't have to speak a lot or make strange facial expressions to be convincing. He doesn't have to play a grandiose king to make his role bigger than life. His dialogues come from the heart. It is yet another unforgettable performance from Naseer, the one and only. Anupam Kher is restrained and brilliant. The difference between the way he portrays serious yet sensitive men and the way he portrays comic and funny people is thrilling and incredible. Jimmy Shergill is amazing in a small yet pivotal role of a intransigent, hot-tempered, angry, disciplined and serious policeman. So is Aamir Bashir. Deepal Shaw is effective.Well, in conclusion, A Wednesday is an entertaining film with a universal message. Watch it, you'll enjoy it, and you will learn to look at certain things differently."
"Great Movie, Good thriller and always maintains the intensity. There is no part in the movie which gets you bored. Its full time Entertainment. The movie is short but up to the point. This is a movie where Naseerudin Shah is like a One Man Army who takes over the whole of Bombay police. I really enjoyed it. We need more movies like this. Very Creative.Technically very correct and the movie has a lot of logic. The Direction is superb. Unlike other movies, there are no songs in the movie. The movie can be viewed by family and even teens and I think its for all type of age groups. The whole movie is like the game of chess. Its a puzzle till the end which bursts out at last releasing a shock wave across the movie theatre."
"There are a few movies that entertain, there are a few movies that give message and then there are a few movies that you can relate to. A Wednesday is definitely one such movie.The story revolves around an anonymous man (Shah) who calls up the commissioner of police (Kher) and informs him about the bombs that he has placed. Bomb blast is something that I personally am scared of. It had ripped Mumbai in 1993 and then in local train and bus. Only people stood by each other. It followed thru out the country. And what can one common man do? . The story line is fantastic. Its hard to believe that this is Neeraj Pandey's first movie and he has taken a gigantic leap without including any songs. The movie itself is only one and a half hours - half of what Bollywood movies usually are. Then he has not shown the police administration either as corrupt or the bookish kind of honest. He has probably taken the real view of police department And then the cast. Naseerudding Shah is one actor who can crawl under the skin of any character. Be it the coach in Iqbal or the pirate in The League of Extra-ordinary gentlemen. Then there is Anupam Kher whose acting abilities are still not tapped to the best by any director. These two stalwarts make-up this movie. And this movie does not have him in a stereo typical dads role. Aamir Bashir as Jay and Jimmy Shergill as Arif are just outstanding. Nothing in the movie is out of context. Well-acted, well-directed, well-scripted, well-executed."
"Like many other people, the reason I came to watch ""A Wednesday"" was because it features in the current IMDB top 250 list. The film was also necessary viewing for the top 250 lists of 2016 and 2017 previously. I was quite confused, and immediately sceptical, as to why this 2008 Indian film was only recently coming into the spotlight. For most other movies, this usually indicates a film of high quality. However, as my 5/10 (average) rating suggests, ""A Wednesday"" is a film FAR removed from the quality required to merit such a position. It is notable to say that of the 198 films I have seen of the current top 250, this film has received the lowest rating from myself.With that context in mind, I shall now talk about my assessment of the film. The most egregious aspects of ""A Wednesday"" are definitely in the ""action"" set pieces. The physical confrontations (one interrogation scene and another chase scene) are woefully uncoordinated to the point of parody. The acting in these scenes fall under heavy scrutiny, unfortunately, as a direct result of this and is entirely unconvincing. The sound editing is perhaps the worst part of these scenes (it sounds like it's come directly from a children's toy/soundboard). It is so jarring that it would have undermined the action scenes even if they had been well choreographed. The special effects are also unconvincing but, since it has a minute presence, it doesn't hinder the film too greatly. I am also unaware if there were budgetary limitations the film had in its making so I don't think it would be entirely fair for me to condemn it for that. Luckily, there is little action to corrupt the entire film but this has led to some reviewers stating that the film is a boring office set piece as a result. I'd be inclined to disagree as the film's premise out with the action offered the greatest potential that the film ultimately failed to fully fulfil. A further, but more pervasive ""flaw"" is in the film's editing. There is an overabundance of slow-motion footage and abrupt cuts. However, I would say that although the film's editing will come across as a bit cheesy it is still of an adequate quality. This could be as much a case of time working against the film if anything (although I doubt that is the case).I will now address the more positive aspects that the film has to offer. The acting from the main cast is decent for the most part; Anupam Kher and Naseeruddin Shah play the police commissioner (Prakash Rathod) and the ""terrorist"" known only as ""The Common Man"" play off of each other well. The script is decent and has some interesting dialogue (one scene comes to mind were Rathod tests his officer's commitment to finding the bombs was a highlight) but I felt that the concept had a lot more potential than its final product. The villain's motivations were interesting and certainly more 3 dimensional than your typical action movie, however, again, I felt that they could have gone into more depth into his character. The conclusion seems to inspire a profound sense of patriotism in the Indian people (hence its high rating) when the two stars finally come together. Whilst understandable, I was a bit disappointed that they didn't go further with the moral conflict here and didn't attempt to provide a more nuanced argument. The film reminded me of the anime ""Death Note"" to some degree and I was hoping to see a high stakes battle of wits unfold similar to the likes of ""L"" and ""Light Yagami"" or between ""Sherlock Holmes"" and ""Moriarty"". The secondary villains (a group of terrorists) are played well enough but I felt that they were more 1 dimensional in presentation. I'd also finish by saying that the cinematography for the film is suitably engaging and the camera is dynamic enough to keep your concentration during the film's slower segments.I'd like to finish on a more positive note as I attempt to lend some support to this film. I noticed that ""A Wednesday"" had a 5.4 rating from the ""top 1000 voters"" on IMDB with the highest percentage (22.5%) of those giving the film a rating of 1/10. In the same way that I have criticised people who have overrated this film (resulting in its unjust placement in the top 250) I feel that I also need to criticise those who are being equally unreasonable in their negativity. Objectively speaking, this film does a lot of things fairly well and others poorly thus warranting its 5/10 (average) rating from myself. ""A Wednesday"" is a competently enough made film with a coherent story, decent acting and cinematography etc so it could DEFINITELY be a lot worse. I wonder how many top 1000 voters have seen the IMDB's BOTTOM 100 movies as a frame of reference. I've even seen top 1000 voters give the likes of ""Jaws"" and ""The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King"" 1/10 ratings!To summarise, this film is highly overrated on IMDb and shouldn't be on the top 250. At the same time, it is a decent enough movie which works well enough within its limitations- I doubt ""A Wednesday"" was made with the intent of becoming an all-time great film! Just a simple, honest thriller. I found it moderately enjoyable, if forgettable, and think it should be recognised as such. I ask South Asian reviewers to seriously reconsider the films that they are trying to promote as the best of Bollywood cinema. Films like this and ""Andaz Apna Apna"" are really overrated and annoy and scare off Westerners from watching your other films- and that's a massive shame. There are good Bollywood films out there like ""3 Idiots"" so try and promote these films instead. Please try and consider how your films will resonate with global audiences, I know Westerners should do the same but the sad fact is we can afford to do so because of the more global reach of Hollywood. To address Westerners, don't take out your anger out on the film for its high rating, it's not its fault, so I just ask reviewers to be fair in their assessment. If you're the kind of person to give this film a 1/10 rating just to take it off of the top 250 then you're just being hypocritical! Be consistent and objective in your criticism and, hopefully, this will encourage others to do the same."
"I gave an extra point just for the fact that this is relevant cinema. Instead of churning out the next round of mindlessness that earns 140 crores due to the multiplexed masses, this one tries to talk about the current helplessness faced by the common man in India. The topic for discussion is terrorism. The movie begins with a phone call to the Police Commissioner informing him of bombs and asking for the release of 4 terrorists.. The movie then predictably moves into the Negotiator and clock ticking genre.The acting is well done, the plot maybe not that believable but the dialogue at the end is gripping and humane. Naseer and Anupam are as good as they are - no surprises there. There are no songs (GOOD!) and the movie chugs along at an okay pace.. The movie doesn't have a solution... rightly so coz terrorism has none too I believe. It just voices out the anguish of the little the common man expects but has become a rarity now. Expect no hitchcockian twists and you should be happy for the price of your ticket. Certain things that we ""get used to"" leads to the entire society being trodden upon. Not saying NO at the right time leads to a heavy price in the future. Recommended for a late night snack watch."
"I don't think I've smiled so broadly after watching a non-comedy for ages. Sadly, I don't think this is going to set the box-office alight (due to the lack of a bankable star) but it surely lit up my world and I'm going to recommend it to everyone.A man (Naseeruddin Shah) calls up the police HQ, speaks to the Comissioner of Police (Anupam Kher) and advises him that he has planted 5 bombs across Mumbai and will detonate them until his demands are met. The only demand he makes is that four known terrorists are gathered together. All the cops, their intelligence, the Chief Minister etc are not able to trace this person or get any information about him. What does he do next ? Who will win, this unknown person or the wily commissioner, who has all the resources of the state at his disposal ? The movie doesn't really start till about the fortieth minute mark, just plods along till then. But then once it begins, it manages to keep the tension alive very nicely. I haven't seen too many Hindi movies with a central control room or a good cop and bad cop routine (ably played by Aamir and Jimmy respectively) and this one pulls off both quite nicely. Also, it thankfully remains focused on the plot and doesn't deviate for any item songs or normal songs or romantic interludes. There are several nice touches as well  the CM's exclamation, 'He Parmeswara', when informed about the crisis. The whole 'Electric Baba' thing. Or the way the terrorists identify themselves to Naseer (will let you find that out for yourself) or the way the director litters a few red herrings around. Great acting by everyone, great editing and camera work and very well put together.I've had similar thoughts as the film's lead character a few times. Maybe not as drastic but getting there, give me time, this film has merely watered a germinating seed. I would love to talk more, expound on what I'm feeling but am forcing myself to desist. This is one of the pleasures of being a reviewer, the ability to introduce a rare, hidden gem to the audience. Please see it before you find out how it ends.

"What makes a good movie? I say a good movie should have good acting, good sound production, good camera work, good plot, be well directed and so on. What makes a ""top 250 grade"" movie? Wonderful acting, amazing sound production, astonishing camera work, really unique plot and to be directed by someone who has outstanding talent. And this movie isn't even good. Why? The only thing it has is some kind of a ""message"". Well, having a message is not enough. It doesn't have anything a movie should have. Acting is just awful, especially the fighting scenes. Music sounds out of place and cartoon punching sounds are just ridiculous. Camera work is strange. Plot is average, or slightly above. And i won't even say anything about the director.First of all, this movie looks like a cheap TV drama. And i know it has low budget. But making shots of a cat getting thrown from around the corner or ridiculous fighting scenes with cartoon sounds has nothing to do with money, it's a matter of taste. Those who made the movie just don't have it.Next, CGI. Yes, it does have it. But it would be much better if it didn't. Because showing the audience some strange black silhouettes unnaturally flying out of an explosion doesn't make the movie look more believable, it makes it laughable. Well, CGI costs money. Congratulations to the creators of the movie - they found the worst way to waste it. Because if you don't have enough money to do good special effects, you shouldn't probably do them at all.Also, introducing a superhero-cop character in a movie that is supposed to be an intense moderately realistic thriller with some drama mixed in wasn't such a good idea.So, as a result we have a movie that looks bad, sounds bad and feels bad. However, it's kinda useful - without it i would've never known what a really awful movie actually is. This one makes a great reference.I've never actually written a review before. And what made me do it is the fact that this movie somehow made it to the top 250. Believe me, it doesn't belong there. Just doesn't. It's a shame that some site users do not want to rate movies according to their quality, but rather use the flaws of the rating system to push movies from their country to the top just because they want to."
"Brilliant movie. A complete and wholesome masterpiece. A realistic and commendable approach to the ticking time bomb that is the resilience of the Mumbai population. I hope movies such as this, ""Aamir"", ""Mumbai Meri Jaan"" and others of this rank keep coming because movies such as these makes me proud of the Indian cinema fraternity.The acting done by greats like Anupam Kher and Naseeruddin Shah cannot go unnoticed. The movie has a rather slow pace in the beginning but with time the movie grips and keeps you at the edge of your seat. Watch out for excellent dialogs exchanged in the end of the movie. Noteworthy performance by Jimmy Shergill and Aamir Bashir.An absolute must-watch for everyone."
"While I understand A Wednesday did some good job in heavy uplifting patriotism, is it enough for it to be placed into top 250? I do not think so. I see most of the reviews are a bit, how to put it, ""overly-benevolent"", I suppose written by people moved by the message.While movie have some interesting moments, it is slow paced, unimaginative, predictable, unrealistic and in my opinion, too long. Come on, I feel like 75% of all scenes was just a cops and politicians playing important while heroic music plays - that's it - good guys walking in a corridor (lot of corridors out there, believe me) and music, talking to a phone (you mostly cannot hear what they are saying) and music, waiting in a car and music, sitting, standing and so on. But the story was there, it just the movie should have been shorter by half. Occasional action is laughable. That is said, if you can call a scene of a some sort of cop beating some sort of thug into a pulp with his 90's midi sound waves superpower (checked, nobody came to any real harm for sure) an action. But short laugh usually came to end shortly afterwards, as some pretty nasty humiliating moments happened to the bad guys (they all are...bad guys...right?), which made me a bit sick (hooray - true emotion).So to wrap it up, it is a movie showing message of hatred to the bad guys. You hate them bad guys? Then it is a chance you will enjoy this movie. I know terrorism and stuff is a bad thing and so on - OK, but make a quality movie about it, then I bet it will be welcomed into top 250 with open arms."
"A Wednesday' is a brave attempt which makes a commentary about the social and political fabric of India. In the recent past, many Hindi movies have treaded along this path and sought to bring in a revolution in at least the way people think about issues. 'A Wednesday' is a welcome addition to that league.It mocks the government, reminding it of the duties it ought to be performing as the caretaker of the common people. Another thumbs up for showing the power of the common man and stating in no uncertain terms that religion is secondary to nationality.And the best part is that all this social commentary isn't preachy so to speak. All this is a byproduct of an engrossing edge of the seat thriller with great performances by veterans - Nasseruddin Shah and Anupam Kher. Even the lesser knowns - Jimmy Shergill, Aamir Bashir and Deepal Shaw shine in impactful roles.A well scripted affair; it has some masala and cheesy lines which has enough juice to get the sub-urban masses whistling.It caters to every Indian -- Niche or Urban and should not be missed."
"IT IS TRUE WHAT THEY SAY about greatness. It is always meant to be. No amount of planning or foresight or pundits with beards longer than their hands can ever truly make someone something one is not. If one is destined to be great  one is. Most times one wonders how much more one has to shout and scream so that people can take notice while other timeswell, other times silences creep in so beautifully that we hardly recognize them and something breathe taking has already been created.Before, dear reader, the assumption is made that I am off on a track quite abstract to the common man  ah, that word suddenly sounds so powerful  let me underline the topic I have chosen. I was browsing through my usual collection of review websites when I happened to get a glimpse of one interesting review. It was for a movie I had never heard of. Neither had I ever seen any publicity posters of it nor had I guessed it would feature two of my all time favorites  Naseeruddin Shah and Anupam Kher. The fact that no one else, except maybe the highly underestimated Jimmy Shergill, was even remotely recognizable on the credit list apart from these three did not deter me from giving it a shot. Bollywood these days is being showered with 'alternate' cinema that runs a delicate line between commercial masala-fundas and the documentary type approaches. In such a rain it is easy to miss some true refreshingly different rain drops. Having shied away from such features for a while, I decided to give this a look-see since I knew Naseer and Anupam would definitely make it worth my time. With that random assumption, I began watching 'A Wednesday'.Two hours laterI was going through a very rare feeling. I did not understand it initially since it had been such a long time but then, I knew. It was the same bunch of emotions I had felt when I had seen the climax of 'The Sixth Sense'. It was the same 'Oh wow!' feeling that had pierced my veins as the final few minutes of 'The Usual Suspects' drowned in my eyes. It was the very unique gut sense of genuine enthusiasm I had felt when I finally understood 'Momento' in its last frame.But, this time it was different. I had never felt such a tingle in my heart for a Hindi movie in many years. Sure, I have had my share of laughs and appreciation for some decent Indian cinema over the years, but there was never anything in them that made me say to myself 'he is so rightthis could happen to me tootodaytomorrowany day' since there was never any context. What 'A Wednesday' successfully did was pick me up from my starry eyed slumber and slap a 'REALITY CHECK' sticker on my face. It reminded me of the times we are part of. It made me wonder about my own life and how unsure things are in the world we live in. It, if not anything else, made me think.I am sure people often sigh and yawn about movies that make them 'think' since it is exactly the opposite reason of why one would watch a movie. No one wants to see relevant issues these days. There is a huge fan following for the larger than life, escapist features which come and go every week. We Indians, the world's best consumers, lap it up in all our glee not caring about if it had anything to do with our life. Why? Since it does not matter. It never does, does it? But then how long can we keep doing this? Once in a while we do need that refreshing slap on the face that makes us realize who we really are. And what a wonderful slap this was! No better way to bring me back to reality than a movie like this one. I was applauding myself for having taken a chance and seen one of the most relevant movies of our times. A silent yet beautiful effort at capturing human emotion on the screen. To summarize in one word  great.Do yourself a favor  watch 'A Wednesday'. A must see for every Indian according to me. If not anything else it will definitely catch you by surprise! I strongly recommend this movie to everyone who has ever sat back and said 'I wish things were different'"
"They asked us on Friday, repeated on Tuesday...I am just replying back on A Wednesday. If someone asked me after the movie about what i had witnessed, I would say a work of brilliance.This is a movie that has made me happy and feel good literally and i mean it by each of my words.A Wednesday is a movie based on the repeated terrorist attacks made in different parts of India time and time again and its aftermath which makes the life of a common individual living amongst us the most painful and uncomfortable and how this common individual decides to respond to these hellish acts.I won't reveal the plot for those who haven't watched the movie yet but i would certainly say watch it and come up with your own views about it because If you happen to be an Indian who knows what exactly takes place in our country, you'll come up with the same statements that i had made earlier.About the making,the performances that stood out would be, hands down, that of both Naseeruddin Shah and Anupam Kher but Mr Shah was at his usual stupendous best.His performance was simply exceptional and showed his genius.Jimmy shergill with Aamir bashir and the other actors also filled in brilliantly.The cinematography and screenplay were brilliant. The pace of the movie in accordance with its plot was picture perfect and terrific but the thing that stood out about the movie was its thrill and drama that captivated the audience along with its pace and storyline.The climax drawn was also outstanding and the director was immaculate with his work of direction. The most wonderful thing about this movie is that the whole plot runs by taking the audience and the viewers along with it and towards the end,the climax brings and involves the audience deep into the theme of the movie and makes one feel oneself as the most important part of it. The movie is just one of those instant classics( I dare say) that will probably never be a big hit for no good reason and yet show that if really desired an excellent small work of art can be made.I am no movie critic and as I write my comments, I write these entirely being based on the mindset of a big movie fan and viewer who has just seen a movie that has made him feel happy and so he expresses his views to all of you.Friends, if you want my recommendation for it, I'd say..Anyday, A Wednesday.Watch it, You'll love it."
"I loved this movie as it was one of those very movies which are meant not for entertainment but for enlightenment.. Watch it and then you will know what I mean to say.. it is me who thinks like this, it is you who think like this, it is all of us!! For us(especially in India)..we have similar situation and yet we will watch this movie and forget it after sometime..!! We also think the same way as the lead person of this movie thinks, we all want to do the same but then, we are the same very stupid common men, we can't do anything except watching this movie and recommending it to others.. its not like I will also do something which the common man did in the movie.!! we have several constraints in our lives, we do not bother giving a thought to these problems. What writer wants us to see is the truth that every man thinks , the fear that everybody has in his mind regarding today's situation.... do yourself a favor..watch out this movie!!"
"So when's that day??? When we will rise like phoenix from the ashes.......So cutting it out to the movie........First lets talk about the movie...... Movie per se is too good and I was moved by the very idea of the movie. As i am not checking the spoiler box, I must be brief......Though the movie is incomparable and nothing can be said without exposing the plot. Now I can easily say that Bollywood is showing some of its traits that can be compared to a Hollywood movie. The idea of the movie is among the best I have ever seen. This movie should go for Oscars not involving any kind of politics this time.Lets see what can be said about the components of the movie, to start with we have 2 of the greatest Bollywood actor in the movie and chosen aptly for the roles. The four terrorists are chosen correctly for the role and also their getup is quite nice and appropriate. In the acting department only Deepal Shaw has shown some weakness, otherwise all the actors for big and small roles have shown their skills. Screenplay is good with too many story running simultaneously at the start of the movie. Cinematography is also fine with the scenes on the road, from the streets and all, also appreciable amount of money has been spent on it too. Background score is a bit too loud but some may find it appropriate but its not.....Editing is nice enough as the coherence is evident in the movie. Now what ..... the king of all ...... Mr Niraj, the director of the movie, he has done a great job by managing all the accoutrement on his back and using the right card at the right time.........This movie has an effect and is generally followed by a deep thinking........ ""When there's a match between India and Pakistan.....and when India loses ... ESPN & STAR SPORTS are not blamed"" It simply says that stop blaming the accessory, take the responsibility of failure, then only you deserve the accolades."
"""That bastard just had guts to walk into our lives and blow it apart. It was A Wednesday!""It is very difficult to comment on this movie without revealing the Spoiler, So I Keep it Short.If you liked Satya, Black Friday and Mumbai Meri Jaan you are in for a treat.A Wednesday is one of the best movies in recent times. Its a hard-hitting thriller, great execution of the script by the director.No amount of praise would be enough for the performance. WATCH IT!!!!!!!!!!!"
"This is one of the best movies I have seen in recent times....The way the director ponders over the current situation of citizens of India. I really liked the way the director takes one by one problem of a common man...(stupid common man)...The movie starts as a police commissioner starts narrating the best case ever handled by him....But he says that the surprising fact is that it is never registered in a file or at any place........I would not agree to some of the previous reviewers that the move doesn't have big star cast......I believe that this movie has the best of the actors in the Indian movie industry.Anupam Kher and Naseerrudin Shah are the actors nobody can be compared with.....they are unique characters and their presence in any movie makes an amazing impact to the movie.I would not like to describe the movie or the story as a whole because I want you to watch the movie and then think of what a common man in India would feel after what has happened with the common man.....I really like the last line of the movie......Anupam Kher says"" He told me his name but I won't tell you because people tend to find religion in a name"" The above lines really touched my heart and depicts the real pain in the hearts of people of Mumbai....I really want people to watch this realistic movie....Hats off to the director and the writer....."
"Think back....how many movies with the terrorists in focus or the bomb blasts have been made in the past few years !! I am sure you would not be disappointed by your memory :) Even a recluse can name a few, to say the least. Then where does this new movie ""A Wednesday "" strike a different chord ? Well the suspense is all out there for you to watch and figure out yourself !!.I have always firmly believed that there are more chances of a movie being a hit if the person who writes and conceptualizes it also directs it.The case here is the same.Debutant director Neeraj Pandey has done an excellent job. This is one of the best movies I have seen off late...the reason being that the movie is very fast paced and does not slack or slow down at any point.It engrosses the viewer in such a magical fashion that the intermission also seems irritating (you pray that it gets over soon)...The backdrop of the story is not something different but the way it has been presented simply leaves you spell-bound.Not to forget the wonderful acting by Naseeruddin Shah ,Anupam Kher,Jimmy Shergill and all the other characters.This is a complete entertainment package for viewers of all age groups and has been made very intelligently and meticulously (no loose strings in the story :) ) It is short (just 1hour 40 minutes) but truly a masterpiece !!! Go watch it :)"
"Never have i seen such a bad flick so highly rated. It changes my whole perspective about rating movies and reading reviews on popular and great sites. I have seen bad movies...i never wrote a bad review...never said its a waste of time...this one is...but not wasted time...stolen time by the idea and rating that it has...and if you say to yourself: ""just one bad opinion floating in a sea of likes"" Try it...go for it. i can assure you its floating in a sea of lies... PS my 1st ever review."
"There are a few films in the 'Top 250' that I do not care for, but that could be because I wasn't engrossed in the story, or didn't find the characters compelling.. I wouldn't call them bad though.. 'A Wednesday' is the exception.How it currently has an 8.4 is beyond me. It has a few okay moments, and the plot isn't the worst. But the execution was straight up bad. Some of the acting is awful, with some truly terrible writing.. some of the delivery of lines was just horrendous (Albeit pretty funny). The score sucks, the sound effects sound like they are ripped from a 90's fighting game. They actually made the fight scenes pretty entertaining (If that was what they were going for, they succeeded).If like me you are curious as you have seen it on the Top 250, do yourself a favour and don't bother. It really isn't worth it. I learnt that the hard way."
"Judging by the standing ovation, from an overwhelmingly Indian audience, that followed the showing of Neeraj Pandey's ""A Wednesday"" at New York's Museum of Modern Art in June 2009, this film struck deeply resonant chords in that audience, as it has with the great majority of the 83 IMDb reviewers thus far (most of whom are Indians, in-country or ex-pats). Politically-conscious foreign viewers seeking insight into the present state of mind of the Indian masses will find the results sobering. The ""Mother"" India portrayed here is a swaggering, xenophobic bully. ""A Wednesday"" serves as a point of pride for Hindu chauvinists thirsting for ""great power"" recognition: those for whom it is not enough to have the world's third-largest (and nuclear-armed) military but who also want popular culture to reflect the actual correlation of forces. The fact that ""we"" can now make a film with as much razzle-dazzle, high-tech, beat-em-up national superiority as those made by the world's only superpower shows that ""we"" have arrived. That this film ""can be compared to a Hollywood movie"" (Abhishek Kumar) is the highest praise possible.Despite the IMDb's warnings against spoilers, the plot details of this ""thriller"" have been covered amply in the already-submitted reviews, including a pretty clear description of the film's big, penultimate, plot twist, through which its main message is delivered. That message would be familiar to and appreciated by many in the U.S.: those for whom ""the world changed"" on September 11, 2001 (when they lost their illusion of invulnerability); those who wanted to round up every Arab, then every Muslim, then every swarthy ""foreigner""; those who lynched a turban-wearing Sikh or a dark-skinned Hispanic; those who thirsted for revenge, against any ""enemy,"" at any cost; those who were suckered into supporting the invasion and occupation of Iraq and those who still are being suckered into supporting the ""remaking"" of Afghanistan.The political subtext of ""A Wednesday"" was expressed approvingly by several of its IMDb enthusiasts: ""mocks the failure of the state machinery to give a free hand to the police force"" (chet rathod); ""right message to everyone . . . don't make us rebel back, it will cost you"" (Prashanth Patil); ""it's time that we woke up & be(came) intolerant of those who take the liberty to end hundreds of innocent lives for the sake of their own unhealthy psyche"" (The Moon! from India); ""you have to kill the cockroach of your house and no body will do this for you"" (abhi vega00). An extremely brutal Mumbai cop (played convincingly by Jimmy Shergill) who delivers a severe and prolonged public beating to a fellow cop, in full view of dozens of onlookers, is described as ""hot blooded"" by several of the film's admirers and as ""the policeman who means business"" (aniket-dave). But the habitual use of brutality is not restricted to a rogue cop. When he wants to extract some information from a jailed ""terrorist,"" the Mumbai Police Commissioner himself storms into the man's cell and proceeds to beat him unmercifully, repeatedly yelling ""have I asked you anything?"" over the victim's vain attempts to provide what is wanted. The message is clear: ""You are at my mercy and I can do anything I want with you. After I have beaten you sufficiently, you will tell me everything."" Some of the film's enthusiasts seem to have gone completely off the rails: ""most striking feature of the movie is its POSITIVITY"" (Jignesh Vaidya). Arun Iyer from Mumbai even called this film ""wholesome""! But there were cautions as well: ""Everything was fine with . . . movie except the idea of standing up against something using extreme means"" (Sree Harsha Sake).It restores one's faith in human decency and intelligence that at least some of the IMDb reviewers recognized this film's deep ugliness, pervasive racism and worship of brutality. ""The film is . . . stridently right-wing in its approach to terror"" (long-ford from India). It ""completely supports"" and ""glorifies . . . the 'fight violence with violence' method"" (The Discolored Chameleon). ""This film is constructed in a way to legitimate the use of force and violence by governmental agencies in case of emergency, and we, the terrified viewers, are invited to identify ourselves with the good guys and approve this point of view"" (dylndg from Madagascar).As some of its detractors point out, ""A Wednesday"" has no doubts about the identity of the enemy: Pakistan, its ISI (spy agency), Al Qaeda and, by implication, Muslims in general, are the sources of ""violence."" To his shame, the justly celebrated Indian actor, Naseeruddin Shah, allowed himself to be used here as a Muslim cover for the film's undisguised Islamophobia. The amused nod of familiarity from the Mumbai Police Commissioner (ably played by Anupam Kher) upon hearing the Muslim name of a suspected ""terrorist"" speaks volumes about the mind-set of the Hindu state.For a large section of humanity, whose attitudes are shaped by media controlled by their exploiters, ""terrorism"" is an activity exclusive to deranged individuals, predatory organizations and ""rogue"" states. When ""good countries"" (e.g. the U.S., Britain, Israel etc.) slaughter innocents, these acts are called ""accidents"" or ""unintended collateral damage."" Blessings on the heads of two reviewers from India (bruce-woodstock and Sreyas S S) for reminding us that the largest losses of life in India have been inflicted by official state violence and by communal riots. (The 2002 anti-Muslim pogrom in the State of Gujarat, during which thousands were killed and injured and tens of thousands made homeless at the hands of Hindu mobs, was facilitated by official indifference to — if not outright collusion in — the violence.) The outraged patriot does not perceive such violence as ""terrorism."" Nor does ""A Wednesday."" By advancing the need for a ""strong state,"" police brutality, torture and, if all else fails, vigilante justice, this film gives aid and comfort to the Dick Cheneys of the world.Barry Freed"
"A Wednesday is a movie which took me by shock to think that there are a few ""New Wavers"" ( a filmmaker that follow a new wave) in the Indian film factory. If i cud i wud personally like to congratulate the the movie squad who is responsible for this utterly contemplative movie, a one of its kind revolution. The best part is it dint need to have the highly hyped stars like amitabh, SRK or Akshay. This movie has a vast potential to create awareness, patriotism, n self realization not just among the common people but also among the people who are responsible for the violence. I still cant stop being amazed at a story so original n real n solemnly portrayed.. just short of words of appreciation towards the makers.. it had the effect of a ' taaare zameen par' on me.. so to the faculty of the movie my message is even if u dint get phony awards like film-fare and so on..please remember that u have made a mark in the hearts of the people who actually matter n they adore u for that .. GOOD LUCK . CHEERS !!!!!!"
"Prior to release, the media called it the much awaited coming together of Naseeruddin Shah and Anupam Kher. Pitted against each other, one is a cool headed terror brain and the latter is the Commissioner of Police who has to balance between political masters and his logic on the situation he gets into on a Wednesday. If not for anything else, Naseeruddin Shah was the biggest draw factor for a power packed performance.India has been rocked by numerous terrorist attacks with Mumbai being their favorite. Underscoring the helplessness that the administration always expresses against such attacks, Wednesday makes a sincere effort to portray the travails that a common man has to put up with each day of his life, commuting to offices in crowded trains, traveling through crowded markets with a fear of losing his life to the act of some fanatic moron.A day before he retires, Commissioner Prakash Rathod reminisces the most memorable day of his service, a day where events just rolled out crippling the entire structure for internal security but that which ended without a case on record. The day begins with a demure, quiet man in the crowd whose name we aren’t told, portrayed by Naseeruddin Shah who conveniently plants a bomb in a police station opposite the commissionerate.Shah then calls to Commissioner Rathod negotiating a release of four dreaded criminals accused of anti-national activities in exchange of disclosing the locations of explosives he planted. Shah also ropes in a TV Reporter Naina Roy, played by former item girl Deepal Shaw to cover the happenings live. The issue turns into an administrative and political potboiler that takes unexpected and unprecedented twists to a surprise end.Since Wednesday hinges on performances to make a point, it is noteworthy that each of them was spot on. Naseer is a class unto himself. Deepal Shaw was convincing as news junkie. Jimmy Shergill was picture perfect in his anti-terrorist cop role. The script has no loose ends and there are no songs disturbing the narrative. Art was thoughtful to place Shah’s workstation atop an under construction building overlooking the city.While it is not your typical action thriller with blood and gore, it is neither a sermonizing thing that leaves you bored. On purpose, I chose not to disclose details of the plot, since I believe this movie is a must watch and should be enjoyed along with the suspense. With a runtime of 100 minutes that has as many gripping moments leaves you feeling good in the end, your time and money well spent! Thoroughly Recommended watch!"
I gave this move a 1 because it was an absolute waste of time. The acting was hopeless and the story line is average. I am still to this day confused why this move received anything above a 1. The acting was so bad in some scenes it made me cringe.The movie an Indian comedy that revolves around a terror plot and the police/secret service trying to save the day.The only good job this movie does is demonstrate Bollywood's ability on making movies. Terrible.Do not waste your precious time on this stupid film. I want my 2 hours back.
"Do you want do watch a thriller Bollywood movie similar to decent ones like Drishyam? Don't even think about watching this one. The movie's biggest problem is its ridiculous style. Every time it's meant to be dramatic, it uses slow motion along with some unbelievably overdramatic music. Two cheap ways to create excitement - and it doesn't work at all in A Wednesday. The production quality isn't exactly good either. Aside from the uninspired shots of the Mumbai rooftops, the sound effects is an embarrassment. They aren't believable and they use the same ones in every fight. ""Is some getting kicked twice? Lets use the same lame sound effect twice after one another."" I've never noticed sound effects this bad before. But here it is impossible to ignore. The plot is a typical ""terrorist blackmailing the police""-one. With a man sitting on a rooftop, making demands from a series of untraceable calls. But we don't get to see the people that he threatens to kill, so its hard to really care about the stakes. The only reason I managed to see this entire movie without falling asleep was the high tempo. All other aspects of this movie are terrible. Overall, this doesn't feel like a top 250-movie at all. More like a mediocre TV-movie. Watch something else. Anything."
"This is quite possibly the worst film I've ever seen.The acting (in most places) is often terrible.The directing/editing is also terrible (far too many half speed shots and poorly executed montages with a lack of coherent shots).The special FX (the airport bomb scene) were comically bad. And the sound effects for the ""fight"" scenes were also comical.I could go on and on. How this is in the top 250 IMDb films is beyond me. Whilst watching we were unsure whether the film was meant to be satirical.Perhaps the only redeeming factors are the soundtrack and the somewhat interesting moral dilemma raised in the protagonist's 10 minute nonsensical monologue.Do not bother watching this."
"I recently decided to try a few Indian films, something I had not yet done despite being a massive fan of world cinema. Where better to start than the films that are in the IMDb top 250? First came Like Stars on Earth ... absolutely fantastic. Then 3 Idiots ... very very good. Then A Wednesday ... oh dear. I had such high expectations and was sorely disappointed.
It's not that this is a bad film (the 1 or 2/10 reviews are ridiculous). it's just that it is a 'nothing' film. The acting is totally forgettable, with not a single compelling character. The cop who is supposed to be the 'bad cop' does nothing worse than partake in some dreadfully executed slapping scenes, the police chief is perfunctory bordering on dull and even the 'common man' baddie is unconvincing. 
The attempts at humour are cringe-worthy. 
The whole film has an air of all-been-done-before. If it was Holly not Bollywood this film would sink without a trace, being enjoyed by people when it comes out and then swiftly forgotten as it joins the endless heap of films with the same construct. Yet it sits in the top 250! There is not one single thing about this film that is anything but ordinary at best.Of course it is a totally different film to 3 Idiots or Like Stars on Earth but those films had magical qualities and were so unique only Indian cinema could have produced them. This film could have been done anywhere, 
Perhaps it is a mere aberration that it appears in the top 250 but suddenly I can no longer safely rely on such a film being at least high quality whether I enjoyed it or not. It really is mind-blowing that so many people think this is an incredible film. 
I give it a generous six."
"While I can see why the subject (which becomes clear at the last 15 minutes of the movie) is popular, it seems this is the only reason why people could ever give this movie a high rating. And this plot-twist isn't even worked out that well, because the first situation was hard to believe to begin with. But populist subjects/ideas, along with outdated moral lessons, seem more often the (only) reason for Indian/Bollywood movies to get good reviews. It's a (...is disgrace too strong a word?) that it is even possible that this movie is in the IMDB top250 best rated movies of all time at the moment.To sum up the flaws of the movie:
Actors are not credible, especially the 4 Al-Qaeda members.Very bad sound effects, dubbing and overacting during the fighting (...ahem...slapping) scenes.Special effects (during the briefing abt the Al-Qaeda members and when the bomb goed of) are laughableBad editing (fast consecutive switching between scenes and slow motions are overly used and annoying)Flat characters and uncredible actions (why didn't the police guy tell his wife to not come back to the city with the bomb threat?)Suspence building is badly done, I didn't feel it.Music seems randomly selected from the suspence category, doesn't work well.If this is one of the best Indian movies, none should be able to find their way to the 250 best rated."
"Numerous films have been based on terrorism and the tragedy of life in BOMBay. Some have a very serious and realistic take on it such as Black Friday and Mumbai Meri Jaan while some have been dramatized to showcase another aspect of terror such as in Dhoka and Aamir. Now, debutant director Neeraj Pandey brings an impactful and thought provoking thriller  A Wednesday, which transcends through the wavelengths of the cinema's sound system to stir up the frustrated citizen in you. All this happens through the articulate voice and superlative performance of Naseeruddin Shah as an anonymous mastermind who provokes the Police department with his threat of bombing the city in 5 different locations.The mastermind's plot builds up rapidly while all the characters are introduced and with his first phone call to the Commissioner of Police (Anupam Kher), the thrill ride begins in true Hollywood bad guy-NYPD style that includes a fancy control room, hi tech tracking units and loads of sophisticated equipment. At the helm of it all is Anupam Kher, the gifted actor who has been neglected for years and has been subjected to humiliating roles that do not suit his talent at all. We need to give all credit to Neeraj Pandey for just being bold enough to direct this thriller with two of the finest actors of Indian cinema. It is a treat to watch Anupam Kher in a serious character role rather than the slapstick comedy we have been subjected to by his directors. His natural ability to depict any character while making it all look so easy as though he has been the Commissioner all his life, is truly the showcasing of India's finer talents. We have seen his astounding serious side in films like Saaransh, Kaash, Parinda, Daddy, Veer Zaara and Maine Gandhi Ko Nahi Maara (list may not be comprehensive). Yes, about 6 films in a career that spans over 275 are noteworthy serious character renditions. Talk about talent being wasted these days. Let us not even get to Naseeruddin Shah who very righteously had given up on good work from Bollywood once upon a time. But with A Wednesday, these two actors get a chance to showcase what they are and have overpowered every aspect of the movie. The film as such is well conceived with the common man's sufferings being depicted in a radical manner. The cat and mouse chase between the mastermind and Commissioner's team is a thrilling game that will engage you completely. A Wednesday is crisply edited with remarkable work on the script and screenplay that truly justified the talents in the film. Performances by the supporting cast including Jimmy Shergil and Aamir Bashir are excellent as well but  yes there is a 'but'...When you walk out of the theatre, it is the plot of the mastermind and the performance of these actors that you go home with. You will discuss these two aspects for days but what you won't really be talking about is the more technical aspect such as background score, which somehow sounds like a C.I.D episode, the cinematography, which is spectacular only from the terraces of buildings or the control room, which looks incredulous for it to be a part of Mumbai Police Headquarters. More like a set from C.I.D again. Even the overall look of the film could have been solidified to suit the otherwise intense atmosphere that builds up. These may be insignificant in comparison to the film's strengths but it somehow feels like it could've been better in its impact had the director focused on these details as well. Nevertheless, the film is very realistic in the dialogues between the characters and in the scripting of every situation. The final 20 minutes that include the great confrontational dialogue between the mastermind and the Commissioner are worth the full price of the ticket. The film belongs to Naseeruddin Shah though as he portrays his character in a definitive manner that is strikingly real like. The ease with which he renders dialogues, his body language, his expressions and his emotions in every situation are all traits of an outstanding talent and a Great actor that he is. The film is thought provoking and instigating as it portrays the dire circumstances that citizens of Bombay live in. The violence and uncertainty that have started controlling routine life can take a toll on the common man itself and that, is the message of this film. The other message is that film makers need to be free. They need to think openly about ideas and stories and cast the great talent we have in this industry without worrying about box-office success because if your product is good, the actors can make it even better and the audience has now accepted this reality and films like A Wednesday are getting an encouragement even from the masses and not just the classes. There are enough reasons indeed for that acceptance.9.11 on a scale of 1-10."
"First Scene of the movie, Marine Drive, Necklace, Beautiful scene and what a punchline to start the movie, ""That Bastard had the guts to just walk in our life...""...The moment movie started, It was edge of a seat thriller. Although, You can kind of guess what's coming next, It is the way in which it has been presented is beautiful cinema work.What was the best about the movie, is the final conversation between a comman man and commissioner of Police. Absolutely Top Notch Direction, beautyfully crafted and navigated movie....A Must Watch and of course, must watch million times for people who have lived in Bombay (now known as Mumbai)."
"An interesting title. A very interesting and well-made movie too. The plot is simple but provokes thought: a bomb threat and a demand to release four terrorists is made by an anonymous caller perched at the terrace of a high-rise in Bombay. The alert police tries to locate him and foil his attempts. The climax has a totally unexpected twist that makes you go into the thought mode. Naseeruddin Shah was at his intimidating best and gave a power-packed performance, maintaining the thrill throughout. Overall a very good movie; the only out-of-place thing was the hacker's one-minute dialogue."
"This is perhaps one of the best movies in Hindi this year. The story was very gripping. This is about how an ordinary man gets fed up with the terrorists and tries to take on the system and the biggest surprise in store for the climax. Most of us wonder what we can do to tackle terrorism but we sit helpless but in the film,Naseeruddin Shah threatens the police that he has planted bombs in the city and threatens to blow them if the police don't hand over 4 terrorists. We are all led to believe that Naseer is also a terrorist but only in the end do we realize that he is the common man who has decided to fight fire with fire. A must watch for every one.Seldom do films entertain you and at the same time make you think. A Wednesday is one rare gem. All actors are simply brilliant .Naseeruddin shah,Anupam kher and Jimmy Shergill put in wonderful performances. Go watch it now.You wont regret it. Trust me!"
"This is definitely one of the few good Hindi movies of recent times. After Johnny Gaddar, I believe this is the best Hindi movie I've watched (PS:- I hate chocolaty love stories). BEST PART :- there are no Songs which is such a relief !!!!! The first 20 mins or so, is sort of a character introduction session, but then the movie picks up and it really keeps you interested till the very end. The plot starts with Nasiruddin Shah planting a bomb in a police station .He then calls up the police commissioner (Anupam Kher) claiming that he's planted 5 bombs in the city and would reveal the locations only if 4 hardcore terrorists are releases. No one is able to trace him and there's chaos all over. I shouldn't say any more :) Good performances by Shah,Kher and Jimmy Shergil. This probably wouldn't be the biggest blockbuster given the preferences of our audiences, but definitely, its my pick of the year so far."
"First of all I wish to thanks ""Mr. Ronnie Screwvala"" for being a unique producer who has the guts to back up projects like ""A Wednesday"". Secondly, Kudos to writer & director ""Neeraj Pandey"", who brings a fresh & new tide in the vast ocean of Hindi Cinema.""A Wednesday"" is not a big movie, but it is many times powerful than all the 50-70 crores projects being talked about in the news. It's a movie which shows the signs of intelligence and the art of film making flowing in the veins of our young directors. It's a movie made with courage, with conviction and with a strong point to raise in favor of a common man.Without giving away the main plot, the story is about confrontation between a man played by Naseeruddin Shah, who has planted bombs in the city and Anupam Kher, the Police Chief of the city. In simple words it's like fire between two stalwarts of our Hindi Cinema and they both make it just worth watching. I remember seeing two giants together on the screen last time in ""Saudagar"" (Dilip Kumar & Raj Kumar) and way back in ""Shakti"" (Dilip Kumar & Amitabh Bachhan). And like those two movies, this one too satisfied my expectations to a large extent.Though the movie starts with some predictable scenes of planting bombs in public areas. But after this weak start, the moment first phone call goes to the office of Anupam Kher, the film is straight away in the top gear and never looks back. The script is strictly to the point and that takes the viewer to the edge of his seat with every passing minute. Many movie buffs may judge the main twist post interval but even after you have cracked it, the movie still has the grip to keep you glued to your seats.Performances have many surprises in store for the viewer. First of all, Jimmy Shergil is completely convincing and once again impressive in his act of an angry young police officer. The four terrorists and the entire supporting star cast has done a commendable job which makes you believe the unexpected happening on the screen. Cinematography and Background Music both completely support the vision of the director.Frankly speaking, the script has its flaws like what happened to the bag planted by Naseer at the station in the start of the movie. But these loopholes must be (essentially) ignored to enjoy one of the most powerful film of this year.The last 20 minutes need a special and standing ovation for both the director and the actors. The long, strong and impressive explanation by Naseer about his reasons is a kind of landmark in Hindi Movies. You will find each word, completely justifying our day to day experiences in life. You will feel that whatever may be the outcome, this man (Naseer) is somehow saying the right thing, which you may have felt at some moment in your life.The worth praising fact about the movie is that it doesn't take sides for any religion or its followers. There are references to some Hindu & Muslim characters, but they do not indicate any partiality on behalf of someone particular character. At many times, the silence of the actors, just says it all. And the best part is that the director refuses to tell the real name of the man causing all troubles in the end. And the narration says that ""If a name is given then it will lead to un-necessary conclusion, so let it be a common man who chose to fight for his own safety"". And that, in my opinion is the most unexpected and original climaxes you may have seen in a Hindi movie. A well written and fantastically executed climax scene, when both Naseer & Anupam shake hands and cross each other is simply excellent.The two volcanoes of talent, Naseer & Anupam Kher have nothing to prove about themselves, but they do prove one thing.....that we are not making much films which can tap the talent available in the country.Imagine Naseer in ""Jaane Tu...."" & Anupam Kher in ""C Kkompany"" after watching ""A Wednesday"". You will surely understand what I am trying to say. I also remember ""Nasser"" & ""Om Puri"" together in ""Maqbool"" in the same context.Coming back to the movie, ""A Wednesday"" certainly takes its place among the Top10 movies of both Naseeruddin Shah & Anupam Kher. And the director ""Neeraj Pandey"" is a talent to watch out in the coming future.An essential Watch, even at the cost of a holiday from your work."
"Please do not hate my review, this is my first review on any movie on this website. Back to the review, Well I just watched this movie yesterday with my mom. PLEASE do not stop the movie thinking that it is a flop movie! The beginning is kind of ""Stupid"" as what you can call it. But the rest of the 4/5 of the movie is great! Back to the review, I thought it was going to be another anti Islam Hindu movie but it turned out pretty well. The lesson at the end of the movie is really good and is a good lesson for the society and community of racial and ignorant people. I do recommend this movie to a person who really likes the tension and thrill while watching a movie. But, I do not recommend this movie for someone who doesn't like many clips in a movie with people getting hit by Police nightsticks. Other than that, the music, action, and story are all great! The actors and actresses were picked correctly and the setting was picked correctly too. Other than all of that, I hope this review helped everyone! :D"
"Oh, this was a hell of a bad movie. I let myself be misguided by the good ratings.The music was probably the only positive in this movie. The special effects were horrible. The bomb blowing up at the airport scene? Oh my.. something like this could only be created in India. There was some guy who got scared by a man threatening him on the phone, but it seems it was an ""out of the story"" scene. We have some bully-policeman, who beats everyone up. Well.. I'm not surprised why India is still in the place it is if the locals approve that. There's only one step from being fond of a character like that to using the same methods in one's real life. And then we have husbands treating wives like this, parents treating children like this etc. And these children later grow becoming terrorists. The bully gets shot by the other policeman and no one cares that it's a bullet from a police gun. Well.. I suppose the viewer should assume that all the police is corrupt and will cover that. An the end the movie is not credible for also one simple reason. No government fulfills terrorists's demands. If they would, anyone could simply demand something and expect it to be realized. So.. NO. It's just another unjustly high rated pseudo-moral movie from India."
The most realistic and well executed movie ever made in Indian Cinema.... This movie is an Eye Opener for the Comman Man of this world.....Everything was excellent...Story of this movie was kind of predictable but the suspense that is revealed at the end is the shocking ever....The last 15 minutes of the movie are the best... Now Performances.... Naseeruddin shah...No words can describe his performance.. Anupam Kher...Actor Par Excellence..... Deepal Shaw...Not much screen space.... Jimmy Shergill and the other Police Officer....Best performances ever by them....My Rating :Direction...8/10 Performances...10/10 Story...7/10
"I saw this movie today for the second time. It's enriched with brilliant performances from Nasiruddin shah , Anupam kher, and a lot more actors whose names i can't recall now.It is the best thriller, though flawed sometimes, I have seen till date. What a nice movie!!!- That's all i can say.It is focused on the current issues India is facing - terrorism, bomb blasting. The drama created is very interesting and watchable. When camera focused on Nasiruddin shah , his histrionics are watchable with at most attention.All in all a rich movie with performances."
"Now this is what we call real cinema . The plot of the movie is about a stranger who remains a stranger till the end of the movie , how he challenges the whole system and what effect he leaves on the people.The movie has some brilliant performances by the very well renowned legends of the Indian film industry, Naseerudin Shah and Anupam Kher. But i really liked the role played by the former. The confidence level and the finess they both have cannot be challenged. The story is about a common man and about his hatred for terrorism. The movie starts at a dull note and the audience remain confused for the first 20 mins. But as the movie progresses, some excitement is developed. The story is well framed and the direction is good. Initial impression of Naseerudin Shah which the audiences frame is of a terrorist or a psycho killer who likes to relieve his anger on the general public. He demands for the release of four terrorists in exchange for the location where he has planted the five bombs. But the story turns its wheel when he himself kills the terrorists. This incidence seems unacceptable by the audience until he reveals his identity to Anupam Kher who plays the role of the police commissioner of Mumbai. He addresses on behalf of a common man and what he feels when any terrorist activity takes place. The director has very effectively shown from the movie what a common man can do. The main plus point of the movie is that there are no songs and thats where the background score plays its role. The performances by other actors are good and their character suits the story.For further reviews about movies visit : www.moviecritico.blogspot.com"
"Really sad and pathetic, another communal movie made by the communal people,,, killing is a big sin,,, i wish the movie had talked about the thousands of brutal killings and rapes in riots all over India since last so many decades,,, aren't incidents like Gujarat or other thousands of riots terrorism??? No one wants to talk about that, or the thousands of rapes and killings by soldiers in Kashmir since last more than 2 decades. Why doesn't the movie show people who finance and carry out mass murders in riots, why doesn't it talk about terrorists like Bal Thackeray or Narendra Modi??? Why always present Muslims in a bad taste, when its the Muslims who are being butchered, be it Iraq, Bosnia or Palestine and many more places."
"The pace of the movie is good; the performances are powerful, etc. But the whole film is about justifying violence. If you think that violence is justified in order to stop violence, then this is your cup of tea. But justice with violence is a violent justice and a justified violence, and if that is so then when will violence stop, or who will stop it?? If the state or some other official authority kills a person without the permission of a court or legal authority (if your legal system allows death punishment, which is itself a cruel and inhumane punishment), then torture or extra-judicial executions are simply forms of extra-judicial punishment. Some governments do not hesitate to break their own legal code in the name of security, and this is simply against human rights. The acts of terrorism are beyond this classification; improper use of force by non-state actors is not usually called extra-judicial punishment but called assassination, guerrilla warfare, murder or vigilantism instead. This is because they are terrorists, not legitimate governments. However, if governmental agents or forces refer to unlawful acts such as torture or extra-judicial executions, these acts should be considered to be state terrorism. This film is constructed in a way to legitimate the use of force and violence by governmental agencies in case of emergency, and we, the terrified viewers, are invited to identify ourselves with the good guys and approve this point of view; i.e. the use of violence can be legitimate if it is necessary in terms of public security. Not my cup of tea, thank you."
"Long time ago there was a thriller done by jackie shroff and sushmitha sen. It was so pathetic that i don't even remember it's name. If i was into IMDb and i was permitted i would have given a zero. But for this, I am voting 9 out of 10. I am disappointed only because it lasted for just a little over an hour and half. The screenplay takes the mantle of carrying the flick over box office and for me it did an excellent job. I sincerely hope that this movie will get into good revenue comebacks not for the sake of the producers, but in a hope that the revenue influences people to make some sensible movies like this other than the romance or action garbage they call movies today, if not others at least neeraj pandey may be!!!Everything was fine with movie except the idea of standing up against something using extreme means.... Since i restricted myself not to give any spoilers i sign off here.... I wish people do see the movie asap. I promise you won't be disappointed."
"What would you think about a movie of the thriller/suspense genre, which runs for just 100 minutes, has NO songs, NO romance but bombs, police, chases, shoot outs, high end technology.another one of the Hollywood action movieah well this time it is achieved in our Bollywood by Neeraj Pandey in his directorial debut ""A Wednesday""""A Wednesday"" is a remarkable venture which enthralls audiences with the sheer simplicity of the plot and extremely proficient acting. Being a suspense thriller, I will not reveal the plot and concentrate on all other aspects of the movie. It has been a long time since we saw two of the film world's finest actors together in a movie. The wait has been worth it. The duo have put up such a fantastic performance that one is compelled to think why contemporary writers can't come up with subjects which will fully exploit the potential of such geniuses. Naseeruddin Shah changes moods with finesse. He is convincing as the simple inconspicuous citizen of the city and within minutes puts up an equally convincing face of a man with a mission who would not care of the means as long as the end is achieved. Anupam Kher as the Police Commissioner puts up a first rate act. The exchanges between the two are snappy and well written. The climax belongs completely to Shah which grips the audience. Jimmy Shergill and Aamir Bashir have also done a good job as the clichéd Hindu- Muslim police officers. Deepal Shaw as the news reporter has done well.The film takes a dig at the news hungry media today. The bit about Electric Baba is hilarious. It also mocks the failure of the state machinery to give a free hand to the police force as well as equip it with latest technology to combat terrorism. The editing is smooth and direction very promising for a debut. There are a few lacunae like how do you show the Police Commissioner driving out alone from a Police Station in a state of high tension? How come the news once shown on TV doesn't spread like wildfire and other news channels start clamoring for it? However they can be overlooked for the viewing pleasure that the movie provides.Rating 9/10"
"Things about the movie i liked the most :1) No songs or unnecessary shoots. 2) Movie stays to the point.. no part of the movie looks avoidable. 3)Starts with a definite aim and finishes there.. does not sway from the topic.4) runtime of only 100 minutes.. 5) Deals with all real time issues.. and not hypothetical ones. 6)Does not leave any part unexplained, and at least I did not find anything objectionable in the movie. 7) Shows the Perspective of the Most common man & the Most powerful man in the city & very easily shows how the former makes the latter utterly helpless. 8) Definitely asks all the questions that you , yourself as a Indian would have thought about asking the government a thousand times."
"Another brilliant cinematic experience yet again from Bollywood in 2008.. Plot : a stranger (played by Nasarudeen Shah) threatening to Prakash Rathod, commissioner of police (played by Anupam Kher) about the bomb he has planted to blast at 6 pm at five different places, it can be avoided if they can release 4 terrorists... All happening on a Wednesday between 2 pm and 6 pm !!!Great plot well executed with adequate thrills, twists and suspense... No unnecessary sub-plots or item numbers to disturb the narration.. Climax was too good....Yet again a debutant Neeraj Pandey a creative writer and director delivers a great product, superb direction with good treatment, narration and no boring stuffs!!Tight screenplay, powerful and thought provoking dialougues.. Coming to performances Indian cinema's two legendary actors Anupam Kher n Nasarudeen Shah, both just rocked to the core with perfect portrayals, supporting cast was also gud... Good BGM and thank god there is no songs... Cinematography was also top class...Verdict : Must watch !!! Just spare 90-95 min to watch this amazingly thought provoking suspense thriller..."
"this is an awesome movie , a lot like my feelings , a common mans feelings towards the terror attacks in recent times , i hope this movie sends the right message to everyone including those involved in the terror acts , the message is ""dont make us rebel back it will cost you"", the acting of naseeruddin shah and anupam kher is fabulous, jimmy has done a excellent job in his role, and guys PLEASE Don't MISS THE LAST DIALOGUE , its excellent.movie is full of thrills, till end you'll never feel like getting up from your chair , its a short movie(100 mins) but full of masala , better watch this kind of sensible movies than watching some commercial non sense moviesto conclude do yourself a favor , go watch this movie"
"'A Wednesday', as the title suggests is a very simple & down to Earth movie that talks about the subject-- 'A Wednesday!' Quite common which is! The movie talks about the common man's view & stand that's the need of the hour, on the recent terror attacks that have spanned the entire nation! The viewer is compelled to think & react, if nothing more, about subjects like Terrorism & the the Indian Government's way of dealing with those convicted of mass murdering & rioting. The movie is a reminder for all those who have gotten used to adjust with life under the threat of terror attacks, that its time that we woke up & be intolerant of those who take the liberty to end hundreds of innocent lives for the sake of their own unhealthy psyche. A Must Watch!"
"Seriously after watching the movie i felt that my mind has been blown. You see two stalwarts of Indian cinema, Anupam kher and Nasserudin shah, stealing the show. These two actors have proved why they are so admired and loved. After a lot of pushing from one of my frens did i watch this movie coz i was bored off seeing all the ""sensitive bomb aftermath"" stuff. But this had a completely new take on the subject and i really liked the way the subject was handled. I watched it for the first time, then for a second time and again for a third time...i feel like watching it over and over again. It;s the story of a common man's reply to terrorism and giving them a taste of their own medicine. I must say a must watch for every one...and also a must watch for the ones who want respite from the age old johar and barjatya stuff... More of a Indian version of righteous kill but has nothing to do with the plot of the movie."
"I saw this movie after much recommendation from a lot of people. And it turned out to be even better than i had expected.A superb story and direction makes this thriller a refreshing change from the regular action hero or documentary styled bollywood anti-terror movies.The movie is very fast-paced, and keeps you glued to your seat the entire time. The story unfolds brilliantly.Naseeruddin Shah and Anupam Kher are brilliant as always. Jimmy Shergil as Arif, the policeman who means business, shows that he has talent and deserves much better roles than what he's been getting of late.All in all, a must watch.Thumbs Up to Neeraj Pandey for having come with such a brilliant story!"
"A WednesdayOne can say its the Indian answer to fantastic film-making. Crisp, fast, logical and to the point. No melodrama, no song-dance routine. The characterization is very good. Both Anupam Kher and Naseeruddin Shah form a wonderful couple of veterans pitted against each other. Jimmy Shergill looks marvelous as the cool guy. Editing is great. So is direction. Camera work is top notch. All it lacked was good publicity.A must watch !!!PS: Do not try to do it, though one would love to do..."
"When you have Naseeruddin Shah on one side and Anupam Kher on the other, two of Indian cinema's ace veterans, the power of performance just oozes out of the screen energizing you. Throw into the mix well essayed roles by an ensemble cast picked judiciously, sharp and crisp editing and a neatly and tightly plotted script rooted in contemporary issues that thrills at every curve and you've got 'A Wednesday'. Naseeruddin Shah calls up the commissioner of Police, Prakash Rathod (Anupam Kher) warning him of bombs planted by him at four places in the city that he will detonate them if four 'most wanted' militants are not released. The usual cat and mouse game follows, with the 'terrorist' staying ahead of the curve as the police tries to crack down on him. But the things that make the film stand apart are threeits relentless pace, some deliciously biting dialog and nicely balanced performances (even by the fringe performers like Deepal Shaw who plays a TV reporter). And of course, you cannot afford to miss Naseer's monologue at the end which drew numerous rounds of applause from the audience. It is vintage Naseer who keeps you captivated and brings out the soul of the script in a heart wrenching five minutes. Neeraj Pandey's (the director and scriptwriter) effort by way of bringing out the best in its actors is a hugely enjoyable piece of movie making and another sensible depiction of the terrorism menace and its consequences after 'Aamir' and 'Mumbai Meri Jaan'."
"The real hero of A Wednesday however, is writer-director Neeraj Pandey who makes an assured, confident debut with a film that truly pushes the envelope.It's a film you'll find hard to get out of your head days after you've left the cinema. At last a film that has the power to change how we look at the world.A Wednesday is an engaging thriller with a twist that's more dramatic and unpredictable than anything you're likely to imagine. Films about terrorists holding a city to ransom aren't new. It's a theme that's been exploited many times over in the movies, especially in standard Hollywood action films like the Die Hard series. What elevates A Wednesday from your average action thriller is the fact that it comes loaded with a very solid ideology - there's more to this film than just a race against time to save a city. It's well-intended and makes its point emphatically. It's difficult to explain just how good A Wednesday is without giving away too much about the film. Because believe me, it's a film best seen without any impressions. It's a film whose charm lies in its unraveling. The director assembles an ensemble of fine actors who perform their roles competently - Anupam Kher as the conflicted Commissioner, Naseeruddin Shah as the anonymous caller, Aamir Bashir as one of the two younger cops assigned the job of transporting the militants to the designated spot, and finally Jimmy Shergill as the other young cop, hot-blooded and impulsive."
"Most great movies will have all time truths such as love, friendship, universal brotherhood, and so on. This film has one of the rare subjects in the same category - Frustration and reaction of common-man. I remembered Joel Schumacher's ""Falling Down"" (Starring 'Michael Douglas'), this is the story of every common man's fantasy.Interestingly, this movie offers an excellent experience of tight story telling for Indian audiences all over world. This has one of the rare examples of going off the track for film makers in Bollywood.A tight script. Crisp dialogs. Awesome story telling. I love this movie for it's casting, a fast pace and 'no crap' like unnecessary songs and comedy which is common in most Indian films. You must watch this movie - you'll love it and you'll recommend to your other friends the way I did."
"With 'A Wednesday', the Thriller genre in Bollywood has finally come into its own. Let us hope that with this film, we- the perennially dumbed-down Indian film-goers- would no longer be expected to sit through 'inspired versions' of Quentin Tarantino flicks replete with 'item numbers' (yes: there are no songs in this one). The sheer pleasure of watching two of contemporary India's finest actors- Naseeruddin Shah and Anupam Kher- battle it out (even if its mostly through telephones) is simply magical. It is an experience not to be missed. Also, there is a powerful message in this movie- which is made all the more powerful because it's not shouted at our faces. Instead it gently sneaks up from behind when we least expect it. But I have already given too much away. Go watch A Wednesay this weekend, and trust me, you won't regret it."
Kudos to the director for his bold venture. He can be proclaimed as an auteur though this is his debut. None can think of such an intelligent plot that sans commercial aspects and thus changes the grammar of bollywood. Even after watching this movie for 2 or 3 times i couldn't resist myself to watch it again. Surely this movie would attain a laudable coup in Indian film industry and stand apart from rest of the movies for its originality and novelty. This movie is going to be a cutting edge movie in India. Naseeruddin Shah and Anupam Kher have not just acted but lived as the characters. To get a better feel of the movie read nothing about the story and just watch it. You will feel something at the end.
"Its excellent,outstanding,superb,mind blowing ...,After long time I watched movie with good script, equally efficient direction.Its ideal example of gripping thriller,on simple storyline without commercial routine big stars.Movie starts from first frame,director never wasted any time,as story unfolds it takes complete control of your mind within few moments.It keeps you on edge,thinking what next than again what next.. It ends with pleasant surprise.I would like to say thanks to whole team of this movie for its content,for reflecting the sentiments of every Indian on terrorism,From which the bollywood film-makers are turning there face,for the fear of labelled as communal.Most striking feacher of the movie is its POSITIVITY.Atmosphere in movie remains positive till end.Regarding casts nothing more to say about Anupam Kher and Nasiruddin Shah,both are titans ,always delivers the best.I think every Indian must see this movie."
"Phew!! after a long pause of bogus movies, finally I get to see a refreshing piece of work. Yes, ""A Wednesday"" is like oxygen for those, who love Hindi cinema, but also feel suffocated with moronic direction 'formula' movies.Story is well chosen. Screen play is excellent. Movie has tight impact on viewers, and doesn't allow them to blink for a second. Flow of movies is great, and it gives a sustained injection of adrenalin in your body.Jimmy Shergill is a cute faced chocolaty guy, but in this movie you see his entirely new avatar. He looks powerful and great in his angry menacing role. Praising Naseeruddin Shah, is like showing torch to the sun. He is one of the most natural and prodigal actor I have ever seen. I guess if only western people could see beyond Hollywood movies, then they would have known that actors far talented than Al Pacino do exist in this world. Again Anupam Kher was great as ever.In the climax, movies seems to loose it's track. The 'blast' special effect is very primitive, and that could have been improved. Despite it's loose climax, the movie ends in a powerful manner.Congratulations to those directors, who dare to experiment with Hindi movies, and come up with such great masterpiece. Please Bollywood, open your eyes, and venture for movies like ""A Wednesday"", ""Taare Zameen par"" and ""Omkara"".Overall I loved this movie, and would like to recommend to all to see this at least for once. I promise, you wont regret your investment."
"Other films tell us ""a"" story, But A Wednesday Cuts out a message in BOLD letters, with fair amount of entertainment value (thrill & suspense= 50 %), which in the end serves the viewers with the COLD reality of terrorism and its impact on the people around ""us"", the director had tried to convince the viewers, about the single face of terrorism-hence there is no mention about the religion and or name of the main character Mr. Shah did a great job in delivering the last piece of arguments between the ""unnamed guy"" and the police commissioner.The message is clear: Terrorism is ""an"" shameful, But righteous act, against a coward Govt and Shameless Politicians, Who are supported by media and People like you and me! Because we choose to go on with our lives, if everything is Alright with ""us""A must watch if you like good thrillers."
"In last one month India saw release of three movies that were appreciated  Rock On, Tahaan and this one  A Wednesday. I was eager to see the movie.A man (Naseeruddin Shah)  may be in his 50-60s, plant bombs at 4-5 locations in Bombay, including a police station. He calls the commissioner Prakash Rathod (Anupam Kher) and requests him to release four terrorist before 5:30 pm, otherwise the bombs will kill lots of innocent people. Prakash is in action and delegates most of operation to Jai Pratap Singh (Aamir Bashir) and Arif Khan (Jimmy Shergil). When the terrorists are assembled and taken to the spot, there is a climatic turn of events  which I won't disclose here and play spoil sports.The movie is very well directed, and without doubt I should say, I loved it. The first time director Neeraj Pandey (no internet search information on his name  who is he?) has done a great job in writing, scripting, screenplay and directing the movie. Hats of to UTV production for giving such directors a decent break in Bollywood. A new gem is found.Neeraj has also assembled a very decent star cast  Naseer and Anupam together, and both have very meaty roles, and they are brilliant  both of them gave me goose bumps. Wow  what a treat to see them act  after such a long long time.The supporting cast of Aamir Bashir, Jimmy Shergill and Deepal Shaw (as TV reporter) are also good. Jimmy Shergill leaves a mark of angry cop  and leaves behind memories of a ""No nonsense"" cop.The narration is fast, the script is tight, the pace is unrelenting, every event keeps you guessing for more. The police department is presented in such a good way  that one feels proud for the way they operate. I hope in reality also they were so good. I doubt! There are surely a few BIG pot holes in the script, but the whole package is great and one can easily overlook them  when you have enjoyed and longed for some more of this stuff coming out of the Bollywood stable.(Stars 7.75 out of 10)"
What do expect from a movie?If you Expect something then you are wrong. It's the Movie which Expects from you . Such movies which expect you to remember what you have forgotten your basics. It's often that revolutionary ideas come to mind after seeing some patriotic or reality based movies. But this is not such movie. It is something original on which REALITY should be based .Direction and storyline is excellent and What else do you expect .Acting? That is one of very good performances by many Indian actors together.You do not enjoy this movie This Movie Enjoys you . It make You look at ground and sidewards .Role of every person is that he just remember his rights do not adjust with them just follow your theme of heart before it stops working.So be a dancer of your beats .
"Without giving anything away from the movie i honestly recommend "" A Wednesday "" if you'll haven't seen it already this movie is a well directed , fast paced movie , it has great acting by Anupam Kher , Naseeruddin Shah and the others as well Jimmy Shergill, Amir Bashir ... , but more importatly it shows the effects , impact , aftermath of terrorism in a very different manner i enjoyed watching "" rock on "" but "" A Wednesday "" is a classic , a hallmark movie , its a powerful film, they have made a movie that will make us think , I'm really happy that we are making movies like "" A Wednesday "" A Wednesday is not about the train bomb blasts,nor is it similar to mumbai meri jaan , the movie is about terrorism but its in the backdrop , this movie deals with something that comes across every other person's mind , when there is talk about terror being spread and nothing being done about it .. it highlights that A Wednesday works like a charm and will be liked by mostly all because of its gripping plot line and its pace. there may be people that may not like it but then to each their own , i'm just happy to share my point of view The movie, right from start to end on a fateful Wednesday, keeps you very interested Please do watch "" A Wednesday "" its a movie that will get you thinking"
"I am really worried for Neeraj Pandey, What would be his next? as he has already given his best on his debut. Normally an artist always says that best is yet to come, but story is different for Neeraj.I Really wish he does take retirement after this movie. Now about this movie, You talk about performances from Electric Baba to the common man. All are stupendous... Some people found starting a bit awkward but even that had message, How News gets manufactured by News channels (""E isko kuch line de bolneko..."") Performances are so effortless, you feel as if its really happening. At the end of the movie each of one in the cinema hall wish to be that common man. Wish the common man of R.K Narayanan's Common man should be like this then what he normally decipts..Story is short and sweet. Barely 3-4 locations, low in budget, but see the impact it carries.Also its high time to consider Jimmi Shergil as a class actor. I wonder how many times he has to prove his worth. You talk about his little cameo in Mummnabhai I, Yahaan, and this very movie.Anupam has got a role to prove his prowess after a long time, though i had very little doubts about his ability. And Naseeruddin Shah is just like one of us, Very natural.I would suggest to each of you to go to Cinema Hall and support & encourage this type of work of art with full heart and soul.Go Watch it...!!!"
"This movie only has one good thing, that is the Climax Apart from that the movie drags on without any excitement any suspense and kind of grip any anticipation any adventure any adrenalin. No nothing at all.The reason why so many people went Ga ga over the movie was that they liked the concept, and the reason they liked the concept was because they all want the terrorist to be killed as soon as possible ( which is a good thing).I also liked the concept but the director made a mess of it, it could have been made a Fantastic gripping awesome movie but in the end the director relied too much on just the idea, Alas."
"The scenes in this movie are extremely over done. Slow-motion where it adds nothing other than a distraction. The same long shot over and over... There are even some random blurs thrown in for good measure. I'm no film critic, but 1 film class was enough to show me that these have all been done before. The fight scenes are completely unbelievable. re-dubbing the sound effects would get this movie another star. Tennis shoe kick on someone's jeans goes ""Ka-pow""?There is almost no character development, only a few are close to believable. The story itself is somewhat watered down. It may have potential if it was re-shot by ten directors, maybe one would turn out a Top 250 movie. I'm sorry, but this is not that one."
"good concept but stupid direction,flaws:1. jimmy shergill goes by himself on to a building, that should not happen and he should go with force. did you ever watch Hollywood movies, they go with a force, what if there are multiple people, they shouldn't take a chance. 2. if they think he is on top of buildings, why dint they use helicopters. 3. anupam kher kept discussing about the important matters in the corridors while the cops are listening. 4. during the bomb detection, there are cops without any protection standing next to bomb squad, that shouldn't happen. so many flaws in direction. 5. and they used a stupid open bus to transport terrorists, 6. the other cop on bus talks to his wife, nobody does that when they are on important operation, cell phones off.i like the plot, which is very good, but direction could have been much better."
"Neeraj Pandey's 'A Wednesday' is easily the best film to come out off Bollywood in the 2000's decade. A powerful and outstanding film in each and every aspect. A film that will go down as a classic. A film that I will be proud to know as a film fan. A Wednesday talks about the common man, it speaks what everyone in the world feels at heart. Performance-Wise: Naseruddin Shah and Anupam Kher give remarkable performances in this Masterpiece. Naseer is outstanding as the commoner. He excels from start to end. Anupam Kher is fantastic. Jimmy Shergill stands out in a supporting role. Aamir Bashir is matchless. Deepal Shaw shines in the climax.On the whole, 'A Wednesday' is cinema at its very best."
"Story of a Common Man, this should the tag line of the movie.As said, this is the story of the common man's worries. The worry he has that whether he can return home safely.A man calls up the Mumbai police and tells them that he has planted 5 different bombs in different parts of the city and wants four terrorists in return. Initially Police Commissioner (Anupam Kher) thinks it to be a crank call but upon finding a bomb in one of the police station, he started taking the call seriously. He gets the best people on the job to locate the person. He even hires a young hacker to trap the calls and locate the person.Finally when he fails from all angles, he tries to get the four militants released and send them to the location the man asked to send them. But expect the unexpected here. Three of the four militants were killed there as the fourth one was kept hostage by one of the police (Jimmy Shergil) to extract the bombs planted.Then the plot revealed. The man (Common Man) called up the police to say that he is a common man and wanted to take the law to his own hands since the judiciary was doing little to punish the terrorists.No side stories, no songs, no dance sequences, no heroines (only woman is Deepal Shaw, playing a TV Journo). Naseeruddin Shah is the person to watch for in the movie when in the climax he is showing is angst towards the system. He is incredible when he tells the story of situation of the common man.A Wednesday is his one of the top five works till date. Anupam Kher as the Police Commissioner is outstanding. Jimmy Shergil and Aamir Bashir are great. Deepal Shaw is OK as a TV Journo. Gaurav Kapur as a movie hero is funny. Neeraj Pandey has not cared to go beyond and experimenting a new kind of movie."
The concept of the movie was good and the ending commentary of Naseeruddin Shah was also fine. But as a movie it falls horribly and not even able to touch any points or make any meaning after the terrorists attacks that happened in Mumbai at 26 Nov 2008. Nikhat Khazmi of Times of India thinks herself a good reviewer but I think she has grown old and should retire now. Why she liked this film so much I do not know. I could have better spent my time by playing Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare or watching Aamir Khan's Ghajni. I just wasted my time by watching this illogical drama. Except Naseer and Anupam Kher the whole cast is horrible. Too filmy the whole movie is. And trying to make comedy of reporters and journalists also falls straight. Don't waste your time by watching this film. If you are very interested then just watch the last 20 minutes.
"I see no necessity to make a wide and detailed analysis. I should first note that this is the greatest disappointment I have experienced about how IMDb rating can be misleading. The film based on a simple story ( simple people, simple day.) but they should have screened this simple story smart. They have screened with simple dialogs and technique ( both acting and cinema). The worse is terrible role-play from actors/actresses. Don't waste your time. It could be creditable for a undergraduate student graduation project regarding to its budget and simpleness. The most probable fact is Hindi people have seen, liked and rated it high. You should care international/multinational rating."
"This is one of the very best movies ever produced in India. This movie is very intelligently made and yet is very simple. This is a must see movie for not just every Indian but for every human on this planet who believes in Anti-terrorism. Hats off to an amazing story, script, screenplay and direction. As always, Naseeruddin Shah was top class. He, once again, proved that he is easily in the top 5 best actors list in Indian Cinema. Anupam Kher was at his best too. Every single character was perfect. Its been a long time I watched an Indian movie and I definitely enjoyed it.Hats off!!!"
"Over the last few years there have been many terrorist attacks throughout the world in cities like Madrid, London, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Surat, Tokyo (underground gas attack) and not to mention the country of Bali in the South Pacific and we watch and see and hear the horrible stories and how people are dealing with the situation. Some manage to get through the trauma and some don't and they need help.An unknown person phones the chief of Police in the Indian city of Mumbai and he spells out a threat that if four terrorists are not released then he will not hesitate to detonate bombs that he has planted around the city. Not wanting the public to know and panic, the chief of Police decides to take what ever action he is capable of and that is including releasing four terrorists.Starring Naseerudin Shah, Deepal Shaw, Anupam Kher, Jimmy Shergil and Aamir Bashir, this is directed and written by Neeraj Pandey.The story keeps you glued to your seat as there's never a dull moment as there is a twist as it moves along. The sheer intensity in acting is clearly shown by all the cast but mostly, I would say is from Naseerudin Shah, Anupam Kher and Jimmy Shergil. What has made this film better than most of the thrillers that have been released this year is that this is able to keep you interested as well as glued to your seats. But above all it does not have songs at all or any actresses dancing half naked.Conclusion: A film that is applicable to everyone and one that is worth watching."
"In recent times Bollywood has been giving us movies with social, terrorism & national security concern, like Rang De Basanti, Halla Bol, Dhokha, Mumbai Meri Jaan, Mission Istanbul and many more. In that category, certainly A Wednesday also falls.The movie is one of the best present from Bollywood after a long time without any useless storyline. Whole the 100 minutes of the movie is not wasted and every single moment has a value. Without doubt I can certify that one more 'diamond' is born in the Hindi film industry, i.e. director Neeraj Pandey. In his directorial debut movie he proved that there is no any risk of being a new director if one has creativity & sense of reality. He gave us a marvelous thriller with a simple and easily understanding story.After Chaahat and China Gate, now again both Anupam Kher and Naseeruddin Shah appeared together in the same movie. These two are Bollywood's all time evergreen & memorable stars who have their own ideas, intelligence and personality to reach towards the audiences. When two bright stars join together there is always a powerful light. And this happens in this movie.The exact idea of A Wednesday is to create awareness among the common citizens of the country who live their daily lives with the worries of becoming preys of terrorism. Most interesting moment comes in the final part when both Anupam and Naseeruddin have a strong argument in their own points of view. Both do their challenging roles as to prove who is a better actor, but ultimately none become less than the other.Jimmy Shergil did a memorable role as a serious encounter specialist in the police department of whom everyone is scared of. Besides him I am too impressed by the acting of Aamir Bashir who did a TV serial named Sarhadein. Here he plays an attentive and dutiful inspector Jai Singh, and has a strong impact upon the story. And one more effective role is of Deepal Shaw as a reporter of UTV news. Of course she is not in the main role but still she deserves attention in the whole story. All the way, whole the casting group did their tasks firmly without any complain.I don't hesitate to say that I have been waiting for a long time to see this kind of thriller movie from Bollywood, and at last got it. I bet that now Bollywood also can make good thriller in its own way without any support from Hollywood. This is what exactly Neeraj Pandey has proved now. I also bet that one more director came to join with Rajkumar Santoshi, Prakash Jha, John Matthew Mathan, JP Dutaa, Mani Ratnam etc.100x thumbs up!!! to A Wednesday."
"Now this is how a thriller is made.Simple plot: - On A Wednesday, a man calls up the police commissioner and threatens to blow up 5 bombs if 4 terrorists are not set free.The best thing about Director Neeraj Pandey's maiden venture is that it moves really fast. It also does not try to force something unbelievable down your throat. No stupid comedy tracks, no songs, no item number, no romantic track and (just like Mumbai Meri Jaan) no over the top ""DeshPrem"". This movie, by its sensible storyline & believable characters, kicks some of the best Hollywood thrillers right in their balls.Acting wise Jimmy Shergill, Amir Bashir, & Deepal Shaw lend apt support to the 2 mammoths occupying the screen. Naseerudding Shah and Anupam Kher once again prove their status as 2 of the finest actors to grace Indian cinema. Lets see...... They do not have fancy get-ups, loud hand gestures or body language & for 90% of the movie both of them are stuck to their respective locations. But still...... Both of them manage to create phenomenal impact on the screen, using only their eyes and voice, truly brilliant.And the ending...Predictable...Unusual...Abrupt...whatever you say the climax is perfect.Another aspect which should not be overlooked about this movie is, how quickly this movie was made. Looking at the sets & locations I am sure the whole thing would have been shot in less than 7 working days. That is precisely why this movie gives hope to a lot of aspiring film-makers that if they have a good and clear concept, they will find corporate sponsors and even reputed stars would not mind working in their films.Spare only 90 minutes, please do not miss one of the fastest, shortest but the best movie of the year."
"In my opinion, this is an ordinary movie with a faulty storyline with an intentional and one sided view. Most of the reviews here show the fanaticism and the prejudice people have towards muslims. On one side they are very concerned about terrorism but on the other they don't care a wee-bit about the things which lead to terrorism and about the terrorism inflicted upon muslims in India which kills more people than so called ""muslim-terrorism"". Today indians want to punish every terrorist as soon as possible as shown in this movie,but at the same time they will behave as if nothing has happened when muslims are killed by extremists in gujarat and other places...How easy is it to forget that more than 4000 muslims were killed in gujarat...to give you a sample ...pregnant women were assaulted and their wombs cut open and the foetus were taken out and cut into pieces...i'm not bluffing..read 'National Human Rights Commission on Gujarat riots'. The man eaters of gujarat are still free ......still after killing 4000 people...But this movie does not depict that at all. It shows only the so called 'muslim terrorists' all the way. (and they behave really funny on the bus in one scene). Justice must be equal to all; the sooner we realise this the better - for all the evil things to end and to make this world a happy and safe place to live."
"By the time i was going for this movie i had already heard positive reviews about it but i still went with an unprepared mind. A lot of times one hears great reviews but the movie turns out to be a whimper. But not this one.One of the recent fast paced thriller was Aamir but this one goes beyond it. The presence of great actor duo of anupam and naseer only reinforces the script which is the biggest strength of the film. Without an overdose of emotions and preaching, the film conveys its message. It brings out one's own fears of the reigning terror in the country and threat we face to our own freedom.The story is about a man who plants bombs in mumbai and telephones commissioner of police to release 4 terrorists to save the city. The rest i will leave for you to see as this is not a spoiler. The movie will keep you on the edge of the seat and will turn out to be a thrilling ride.The movie's timing could not have been better and it hits you straight in the face. go and watch it!"
