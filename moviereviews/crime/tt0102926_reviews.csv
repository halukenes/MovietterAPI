"The Silence of the Lambs is a timeless classic, whose more than adequate storytelling never ceases to amaze.The Silence of the Lambs is one of the most entertaining but least fun films to watch all because of its disturbingly genius atmosphere.
It's masterfully acted, especially from Hopkins's side turning this film into a clever and unforgettable masterpiece. Even though Hopkins and Foster don't have much screentime together they still put on a show to remember. Aside from top of the line acting and the directing the script from Ted Tally's (based on the novel by Thomas Harris) is career defining. From thriller to psychological horror, this movie handles the tone and atmosphere perfectly while switching between the two. In terms of being a psychological horror movie it does it perfecting as it wraps itself around the viewers' head and proves that gore and blood isn't needed to scare an audience. Surprisingly (and deservedly) this film swooped all five major Oscar categories (Best actor, actress, director, screenplay and picture) even though it was released in February, a whole year before the academy awards.The Silence of the Lambs is a remarkable feat in film making and you be seen by everyone, a film lover or not. Shocking and suspenseful it is a thrill to behold.Final Score: 9/10"
"Sweeping all five major Academy Awards (""Oscars"" for Best Movie, Director, Actor, Actress, Screenplay) is quite an accomplishment.  Doing it nearly a year after a film was released is a miracle considering the notoriously short attention span of Oscar voters.  It is a powerful example of how great a movie can be when superb writers, directors, actors, and others work at the top of their craft.`Silence of the Lambs' is  the story of a young FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) who is summoned to help find one serial killer called `Buffalo Bill.' by interviewing another.  Foster's performance is absolutely brilliant.  While Anthony Hopkins receives most of the (well-deserved) praise for his chilling portrayal of incarcerated serial killer `Hannibal the Cannibal' Lector', it is Foster's performance that holds the movie together.  The fear she shows just behind her eyes makes Clarice's outward courage all the more interesting and vulnerable.  This is the perfect way to play the part because it explains Lector's interest in Clarice.  Her only bargaining chip in getting Lector's help is to let him `feed' on her innermost secrets and fears in exchange for his brilliant insights into the psychotic mind.  The title of the movie comes from these exchanges and is very poignant.Director Jonathan Demme is masterful.  There is one scene late in the movie that I will not spoil.  It is one of the most simply brilliant scenes ever staged in a movie.  I don't know if all the credit goes to Demme or the writers, but there is a moment in the film where the suspense builds beautifully to a what seems to be a common movie scene.  However, through skillful timing of the direction, the audiences assumptions are used against them and when the truth is revealed (hint: it involves a doorbell) it is shocking and induced a collective gasp from the audience I saw it with at the theatre.  It set the stage for an edge-of-your seat climax.Do not miss this movie.The movie is incredibly suspenseful and an absolute must see."
"The Silence of the Lambs runs two hours.Anthony Hopkins appears for little more than sixteen minutes, yet during those minutes he hasn't bored you for a second, not even after the tenth or eleventh viewing. Such is the power of his performance, it's absolutely impossible to forget him.His character, Dr.Hannibal""The Cannibal"" Lecter, is a brutal killer with revolting methods and habits, but he's also very intelligent, charismatic and with good taste(you can interpret that as you like).A clichè by now, but who cares? He still is one of the key elements in this wonderful thriller, which sees Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling asking for Lecter's help to catch another killer.The result is a dangerous yet fascinating relationship between the young, unexperienced FBI-agent and the convicted,but basically omnipotent, psychiatrist.He's a step ahead of everyone all the time, and makes sure everyone notices, with his witty, unforgettable one-liners.If there had to be only one reason to worship this movie, then it would have to be the chemistry between the two leading actors.Never before has a non-sexual man/woman connection been more thrilling.Never before has a film's ending been more unsettling and brilliant and left us asking for more.Best watched with a nice Chianti...P.S. dear film-buffs, have the lambs stopped screaming?"
"Brilliant Best Picture of 1991 that never gets old.  ""The Silence of the Lambs"" deals with a young FBI cadet (Oscar-winner Jodie Foster) who is sent to interview a captured madman (Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins in one of the greatest performances ever on the screen) to find out about a serial killer (Ted Levine) who is stripping the skin from his female victims after they die.  The FBI has had no luck with the case and agent Scott Glenn tries to throw a curve-ball to Hopkins by sending Foster.  Hopkins is a former doctor of Levine and holds the clues to capturing the unknown criminal.  Needless to say the film takes many twists and turns, creating a suspenseful thriller that has no equal.  At the heart of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" are the confrontations between Hopkins and Foster.  They play a complicated chess match of words which results in some of the greatest footage ever captured for the cinema.  Hopkins dominates in spite of the fact he has approximately 17 minutes of time in the film.  This is a film that will wrap itself around you and you will likely never be able to shake some of the key elements you have seen in this amazing masterpiece.  5 stars out of 5."
"I'll never forget my first viewing of this movie at the theater and will always look back fondly on it for one reason: helping me quit smoking cigarettes.I read the book first, was fascinated by it, and couldn't wait for the film to come out. That was the day I picked to quit smoking and I knew this movie would take my mind off that matter. I was expecting an intense movie and I got it. Little did I realize how well-received this film would be and how it propelled Anthony Hopkins to super-stardom.Although entertaining, this is not always a fun movie to watch, especially with the scenes with Ted Levine who plays the killer, ""Buffalo Bill."" ""Bill"" and his kidnapped young woman are sick and profane people, respectively, and their scenes are very unpleasant. This movie is not for the squeamish with those and other scenes involving the infamous Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins). There also is some extreme crudeness in the jail/dungeon where Lecter and other inmates are held.Jodie Foster is excellent as the FBI agent ""Clarice Starling"" and Scott Glenn is low-key and effective as ""Jack Crawford."" A major part of the film is psychological more than violent as Lecter constantly taunts ""Clarice,"" while she tries her best to manipulate him to help with a case. The by-play between the two is a game in itself.Hopkins, however, is the actor people remember best from this movie. His portrayal of the refined-yet-cannibalistic serial killer-doctor is one viewers will never forget. I've enjoyed watching him in the sequels, too. The looks on his face, his fascinating vocabulary with intelligent sarcasm and frankness, never ceases to entertain.""Silence Of The Lambs"" has turned into a modern-day ""classic."" If by some odd chance you have never seen this movie, be warned it is a dark, difficult story to watch at times....but it will get your mind off other things."
"I've seen way too many thrillers. You name it: ""Identity"", ""Seven"", ""The Usual Suspects"", etc., etc., etc. I remember my friend being so obsessed with ""Silence of the Lambs"", that it drove me crazy. And I hated the movie naturally and refused to see it. But everyone told me that I have to see this, so I let my guard down. And had an open mind, and I'm glad I did. My friend was right, this is a great movie. It is so well acted, I couldn't even describe. I loved ""Silence of the Lambs"" and would recommend it to anyone. It's creepy and exciting. Trust me, you'll love it.10/10"
This is definitely a film that proves you don't need tons of blood and gore to have a good suspense film.  Anthony Hopkins performance as the deranged genius Lecter earned him a well deserved Academy Award and the same was true of Jodie Foster's performance as Clarice Starling.  This film should go down in history as one of the greatest suspense films in the history of cinema.
"The Silence of the Lambs, having accomplished the rare feat of winning all five of the major Academy Award categories, is a remarkable achievement in filmmaking.  Gruesome, pulpish material was transformed by dedicated participants on all levels of production, and a film that would have failed in the hands of many others wound up becoming a modern masterpiece.  Taut direction and a superb screenplay might be the best arguments for the film's power, but the flashiest are certainly delivered in the bravura performances of Hopkins and Foster.  Their interplay -- and remember, they only share a handful of scenes together -- is nothing short of riveting."
"I just saw, for the second or third time, this cinematographic masterpiece, during an « UGC culte » evening, in Paris. The list of the Big Five Academy Award winners is short. There are currently three of them, in nine decades: It Happened One Night (1934), One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) and ... The Silence of the Lambs (1991). This is not really surprising, this film being excellent, endowed with a script skillfully elaborated by Thomas Harris, with an irreproachable casting including Anthony Hopkins, Jodie Foster and Scott Glenn. In addition, the director Jonathan Demme delivers a work obviously enjoying an admirable preparatory work.Without unduly spoiling the script, if you have not seen it yet, by the greatest fluke: a psychopath known as the Buffalo Bill sows terror in the Middle West by kidnapping and murdering young pulpy women, after partially or completely skinning them. Clarice Starling, a young FBI agent, is in charge of interviewing Hannibal Lecter, a well-known former psychiatrist who has also the characteristic of a truly intelligent psychopath focused on cannibalism. Hannibal Lecter is able to provide Clarice Starling with providential information about Buffalo Bill . But he agrees to help her only in exchange for information about the young woman's private life. Between them is established a link of fascination and repulsion.As a synthesis: a thrilling must see. 9/10 of 10"
"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits Rookie FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is assigned to get into the mind of notorious incarcerated serial killer Dr Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to get his evaluation on the elusive Buffalo Bill, a serial killer who's been abducting and killing young women. When a prominent senator's daughter is kidnapped, it becomes a race against time to find her before she is killed and all the while Lecter is playing mind-games with Starling as well as any help he can provide...The first of Thomas Harris's Hannibal novels to be adapted for the screen, only to be followed some years later with some very lacklustre (but inevitable!) follow-ups, despite it's age this remains one of the most effective chillers of modern times. Despite the mainstream appeal of the film, the grainy lighting and laid-back budget give it an art-house feel that sets it apart from other such films that were as successful. The film manages some effectively disturbing scenes that make it a not altogether pleasant viewing experience.Performances wise, in a very early role, a young Foster shows her promise for future roles, with a gripping portrayal of naivety and vulnerability here that is very compelling and convincing, even though there are some plausibility problems with someone as junior as her being assigned to do something like that. Hopkins too is brilliant as Lecter, playing a dangerous man behind bars who's ability to get inside your head and see the things you don't want him to see makes him no less dangerous, if not more so, than if he was on the outside. He's certainly received the most acclaim for his role over the years, but in my humble opinion, he's actually over-shadowed (though only slightly!) by Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill, a truly extraordinary psychopath with an unsettling sexuality disorder that is probably one of the nastiest things ever to be seen in such a mainstream film. As supporting FBI agent Crawford, Scott Glenn is impressive but sort of just faded into DTV land after this film.It's easily one of the most popular films ever made, so it's likely a lot of you are familiar with it already, but with reviews on the so-inferior follow-up films Red Dragon and Hannibal, I thought it only right that I'd finally give this first film a mention. Truly remarkable. *****"
"The Silence of the Lambs is a masterpiece you cannot miss, it's a masterwork of suspense that blends the elements of horror, crime and psychology into one tight and smooth story. It's only the third film in history to win Academy Awards in all the top five categories: Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Adapted Screenplay and that imply something about its technical quality as a film. It features expertise level of craftsmanship in all departments of filmmaking, and takes a huge bonus from the exquisite performances put in by its stellar cast. After all these years The Silence of the Lambs remains in a league of its own and is a perfect exemplification of just how great a movie can become when all the right elements come together and work in perfect harmony to form a complete whole.Based on the novel of the same name, Jodie Foster stars as Clarice Starling, a top student at the FBI's training academy. FBI agent Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) wants Clarice to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a genius psychiatrist who is also a violent psychopath, serving life behind bars for various acts of murder and cannibalism. Crawford believes that Lecter may have insight into a case of a serial killer called Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), that murders and skins his victims and that Starling as an attractive young woman, may be just the bait to make him help with the case.The direction by Jonathan Demme is marvelous, as the film introduces its chilling sense of dread and has the audience on the edge of their seats, from the moment Howard Shore's ominous score hits the screen till the end of the film, especially during the climax with a lot of perfectly crafted suspenseful and nail-biting moments. The editing is perfect as the pace is methodical from start to finish, and each and every sequence is relevant to the story. The cinematography by Tak Fujimoto is fantastic as it fully succeeds into creating a very dark and brooding atmosphere that captivates as well as terrorize the audience, while also exhibiting excellent camera work that makes heavy use of close-ups which increase the creepiness and tension along with displaying an optimal color palette and minimal lightning from start to finish, which further enhances the darker ambience the story was aiming for. Moreover the production design team has done a magnificent work as every set piece is meticulously crafted, richly detailed and very well-lit. The script by Ted Tally, also packs a very well structured and tight plot, every character has a well-defined arc, all the themes are smartly addressed, the attention to detail is quite impressive, and the complete story and narrative are perfect.The performances are incredible. Jodie Foster as Clarice is absolutely brilliant and gives an impeccable performance as a woman who is desperately trying to forget her painful past and yet at the same time tries to prove her worth in a male dominant world. Anthony Hopkins as the genius psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lecter is the perfect amalgamation of charisma, high intelligence and destructive violence, and gives a bone-chilling and memorable performance that will stand the passage of time as one of the absolute best. The small amount of screen time that Hopkins is given is a definitive testament to his acting capabilities, as with such an elegant and minimal performance, he solidifies himself as one of the most iconic villains of all time. Due to the charisma and electrifying chemistry between the two actors every scene they share becomes an instant classic.In conclusion, the Silence of the Lambs is one of the greatest films ever made and a masterwork of brilliant direction, smart screenplay, splendid camerawork, tight editing, marvelous score and exquisite performances, that cemented the legacy of both Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster by engraving their iconic characters into the annals of cinema. The film absolutely deserves all the accolades and recognition it gets, for both its contributions to cinema and the immense impact it had on pop culture. Jonathan Demme's magnum opus is an outstanding achievement in genre filmmaking that has inspired and influenced countless thrillers since its release, and is not only the quintessential suspence and psychological horror film but also an ingenious observation of humanity's dark and violent nature and a masterpiece that every film lover must see."
"It is a creepy and taken-by-storm experience with the film, background music is darker than the film itself and too ominous, plot is brilliantly constructed, conversations are thought-provocative, to crown the whole, Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkin are the cream. They take ownership of Clarice and Hannibal respectively, transforming them into the most unforgettable screen images.The psychological path of Hannibal is hard to trace. He is so odd a mixture of intelligence, cruelty, insanity, grace and charisma. In the depth, fledgling FBI trainee Clarice is no match of him. She is still naive yet very ambitious. On the trail of the serial killer Buffalo Bill, she's sent to interview him, a psychiatrist-turned-cannibal. Hannibal is willing to provide clues to finding the killer but only in return for personal information about Clarice herself. He calls it Quid Pro Quo. In those mind games, the two dance backward and forward between cannibal and FBI agent, mentor and student, psychiatrist and patient, father and daughter. It is Clarice who breathes life into the multidimensional sophisticated psychopath and Hannibal who nudges the aspiring student FBI agent and helps her achieve her first success in a world of Y chromosome where her guru Crawford uses her, embarrasses her, excludes her; Doctor Chilton regards her no more than a simple-minded woman and tries to flirt with her. Frankly speaking, though no lack of other impressive scenes, it's really the nerves fights between Hannibal and Clarice that carries the film.Some of the horrible scenes involve Buffalo Bill who, a transvestite, skins his victims, especially woman victims. But the most terrifying one is Clarice's single-handed trace in Buffalo Bill's gruesome den, which also has become another irony to the self-important testosterone-dominated world. Crawford's misjudgment and stubbornness makes him out of the right track, a special anti-terror deployment resulting in vain. But Clarice, though excluded from the business which she should be on, still holds onto her intuition and through on-the-spot investigation finds the serial killer at last. She has to take on him herself. (Demme uses ""deceptive cutting"" there to enhance the tension.) It is definitely a life-or-death fight, especially when Clarice is in the dark, groping her way in absolute terror. I have no doubt everyone holds the breath when the film rolls to that part.A gripping film that well deserved its Oscars"
"With Silence of the Lambs comes some much needed recognition for the horror genre.  It is a first-rate production all around.  It boasts a witty and suspenseful script based on the Thomas Harris novel, full of great lines. It has marvelous direction from Demme.  Demme creates suspense very well throughout and uses some great directorial shots such as the twin frames of Clarice ringing a doorbell and the FBI men breaking into a home.  The two lead actors won oscars for their performances...each deserved.  Foster is very good in her role, but it is Anthony Hopkins that literally lights up the screen with his complex portrayal of a complex serial killer.  Hopkins does the seemingly impossible. He frightens you with his outrageousness and yet illicts some pity/compassion(albeit not a lot) for his situation.  He says his lines with reservedness when needed and brashness when needed.  The rest of the cast is also quite good with Anthony Heald a standout as a unethical, petty doctor in charge of Hopkins.  Of course the story of the other killer is very very chilling as well.  A quality film in all aspects!"
"There is little doubt that the most memorable aspect of The Silence of the Lambs is Anthony Hopkins' incomparable performance as Lecter. Taking over for Brian Cox, who was effective, but not especially memorable, as the good doctor in 1986's Manhunter, Hopkins instantly makes the role his own, capturing and conveying the charismatic essence of pure evil. To his dying day, no matter how many roles he plays in the interim, Hopkins will forever be known for this part. (It is a credit to Hopkins' ability as an actor that this part did not result in stereotyping. His post-Silence career has been greatly varied, with roles as widely diverse as a stodgy butler in Merchant-Ivory's The Remains of the Day and an action hero in The Edge.) I can throw out any number of superlatives, but none of them do justice to this chilling performance, which I labeled as the best acting work of the '90s. Want to feel the icy fingers of terror stroke your heart? Watch this mixture of brilliant eloquence and inhuman cruelty. As portrayed by Hopkins, Hannibal is both a suave, cultured gentleman and an unspeakable fiend. He is gracious and monstrous at the same time. (Hopkins also provided one of the most quotable lines in recent film history with ""I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti"", which was followed by an inimitable slithering slurp.)"
"This movie has great directing, alright cinematography, amazing acting, solid plotline, brilliant writing, well-crafted characters, and average soundtrack. Although it was wasn't my cup of tea, this thriller movie is enjoyable from beginning to end even if you're not into those type. It is a slow-paced film but it gets intense after a while so patience is key and the acting in this movie made it far more interesting, especially Anthony Hopkins' and Jodie Foster's. Personally, a 7/10 but could be an 8 the next time I watch it again."
"The Silence of the Lambs (1991) is a classic psychological suspense brilliant masterpiece well acted and the best thriller ever made! This was my first film I saw on VHS as a teenager and I absolutely loved it. Right after seeing this flick, I heard about Hannibal (2001) Ridley Scot film a sequel to this psychological thriller flick, I rushed buying it right away. Saddly I was disappointed with Ridley Scott Hannibal.""Silence of the Lambs "" is a classic and I think people would agree. It is my number 1 favorite thriller ever made, mostly I have enjoyed Jodie Foster as FBI recruit Clarice Starling's. Jodie did a brilliant acting performance I have seen. I love this film to death I absolutely love everything about this film. Since the first time I saw her in Silence I went to seeing her in a movie theater 2002 Panic Room, it was her first film I saw in movie theater since than I love Jodie Foster but Silence will be her best film she ever made. I was disappointed with the sequel Hannibal, no Jodie Foster in it, no brilliant masterful Clarice. Julianne Moore was incompetent for me, she couldn't catch Hannibal. Clarice Starling character was based on Gillian Anderson's FBI Agent Dana Scully and I think The X-Files inspired this film. I am even convinced that The Lone Gunman three geeks were also based on this film. You have a nice shootout on the end with Clarice and Buffalo Bill and Clarice get's her man, spoils her plans saves the hostage and saves the day.The Silence of the Lambs is the 1991 thriller that was the feature film adaptation of the novel of the same name by Thomas Harris and marked the first appearance of Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Hannibal Lecter. (Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins in one of the greatest performances ever on the screen) Dr.Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter, is a brutal killer with revolting methods and habits, but he's also very intelligent, charismatic and with good taste (you can interpret that as you like). He is scary and his the same time awesome including brilliant, you can't out smart him. Director Jonathan Demme is masterful directing this flick you have to be brilliant you have to keep thinking to solve the murder mystery. Scott Glenn acts beautiful as Jack Crawford. This flick got five major Academy Awards (""Oscars"" for Best Movie, Director, Actor, Actress, Screenplay) it is no wonder why.Plot: FBI recruit Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is asked by the Bureau to elicit Lecter's help in tracking down a notorious serial killer who has kidnapped a US Senator's daughter. Directed by Jonathan Demme (The Manchurian Candidate), the film would receive five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor for Hopkins and Best Actress for Foster and Best Screenplay. Hopkins would reprise his role as Lecter in two more films: Hannibal (2001) and Red Dragon (2002).Real life killer Ed Gein was the inspiration for Buffalo Bill as well as the inspiration for Norman Bates from Psycho and Leatherface from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies. And the director Jonathan Demme was a film student of Roger Corman who makes a cameo in the movie. Roger Corman taught not only him, but I think other filmmakers such as Martin Scorsese, James Cameron, Joe Dante, Francis Ford Coppola, and many others. Ted Levine did a pretty solid job as a serial killer Buffalo Bill. This film is fun, intense, very well fast paced goes quickly around for those two hours.The Silence of the Lambs is a 1991 American horror-thriller film directed by Jonathan Demme and starring Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, and Scott Glenn. The film is based on Thomas Harris' 1988 novel of the same name, his second to feature Hannibal Lecter, a brilliant psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer. In the film, Clarice Starling, a young U.S. FBI trainee, seeks the advice of the imprisoned Dr. Lecter to apprehend another serial killer, known only as ""Buffalo Bill"".This movie is a perfect 10 out of 10, it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth (Jonathan Demme) with a brilliant cast including Thomas Harris novel that was adapted from it. I even saw the Documentary how they were shooting this film on YouTube. I think I do have that documentary film in my Blu-ray special features. Watch this film you want be disappointed at all. The movie is incredibly suspenseful and an absolute must see for fans."
"It's impossible to comment on SILENCE OF THE LAMBS as being a mere film . Its release was a watershed in popular culture and has influenced a myriad of imitations that are far too numerous to mention . Much of this success is down to director Jonathan Demme who has made the film so effective by coming up with the strikingly simple idea of filming everything in dim lighting which gives SILENCE a moody and brooding atmosphere that was absent from movies in the previous decade . Ironically enough this is as typical of 90s film making as MANHUNTER was of 80s movies . Howard Shore's score also helps the proceedings and Jodie Foster gives a sublime nuanced performance as vulnerable heroine Clarice Starling . Watch the scenes closely when Clarice is in the company of men , don't you get the feeling she has a phobia about the male of the species . Is she a victim of sexual abuse in her childhood ? A lesbian ? We never find out but Foster's performance is multi layered and it's a pity this aspect is never explored in HANNIBAL which sadly deletes this aspect to Clarice Sadly SILENCE was released with a tidal wave of hype which the film doesn't live up to . Who can forget the stories that upon seeing this at the cinema certain audience members wanted armed escorts back to their cars ! I'm sorry but despite being a good thriller it's not that good and I fail to see how people were turned into quivering jellies unable to sleep with the lights off . I'm also afraid to say that much of the awards heaped upon the film aren't that well deserved either . Foster deserved the Oscar as did the film and possibly Demme too but did Ted Tally for his adapted screenplay ? All he seems to have done is to copy the best bits of Harris's novel wholesale into the screenplay without making an effort to improve anything . and i'll probably be accused of sacrilege but the more times I see this film the more times I ask myself how did Hopkins win the Oscar for Best Actor ? I don't even think Hopkins should have qualified for the Best Actor category since the role isn't on screen long enough and his performance is slightly hammy . Hannibal as played by Hopkins resembles something along the lines of a paedophile rather than a serial killer who has maimed , murdered and munched on adults . Despite having some reservations of Brian Cox as Hannibal in MANHUNTER you do believe his burly presence does have the physical strength to overpower his victims , not so Hopkins I know it's very difficult , perhaps even impossible , but the best way to enjoy this movie is to erase from your mind the fact that it's one of only three movies to have picked up the Oscar in all five main categories , the fact that it made headlines about being the most terrifying film committed to celluloid , and the fact that it stands as the 28th best movie ever on this website . It is a very good thriller but one that is ultimately disappointing after hearing of the hype surrounding it"
"It is really difficult for me to understand what it is about this film that everyone loves. I have seen many thrillers and I can honestly say that this one is not even in my Top 20. Although I think Hopkins did a terrific job in Lecter's shoes, his 30 minutes on screen just were not enough. This was supposed to be a horror film but I think it barely managed to create the suspense atmosphere and it certainly did not scare me or made me feel uncomfortable at all. Perhaps I expected more since I have been hearing all the fuzz about this movie since I was a little kid. So I watched this film several times and I am still not enjoying it that much."
Not a single lamb. If you decide to watch this movie hoping to see lambs well I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.
"Agent Clarice Starling is a training FBI agent, hope to work in behavioral sciences with Jack Crawford. Crawford though sends Starling on an assignment, to psychologically exam the insanely intelligent criminal Hannibal Lecter. Crawford had another agenda, to see if Starling can press information out of Lecter to help with the current case of Buffalo Bill. Bill has already killed five girls, skinning off sections of their bodies. Lecter is intrigue by Starling and helps her with the investigation; they start to form a strange friendship.The Silence of the Lambs is one of the best psychological thrillers. Thomas Harris's best selling book is faithfully transfered to the screen. It's one dark twisted disturbing ride. The mood is heighten by Demme's great direction, with such detail in all the sets and locations. Demme has used reflective surfaces wonderfully, during one of Starling's and Lecter's talks it used to great extent. One of the final sequences of Clarice walking through the basement of Bill's house is one of the most suspense full scenes i have ever seen.All the performances are knock outs. Jodie Foster as always brings the goods and makes Starling the most interesting to watch. At times she makes Starling so fragile, then a second later she's strong as steel. Anthony Hopkins is so disturbing as Lecter. From the first second you see Lecter standing in his cell; just waiting for Starling to show, you can see Hopkins was perfect casting. You cant keep your eyes off Lecter, he's so disturbing and can make your skin crawl every time he speaks. Ted Levine makes the perfect serial killer, you can see from Levine's performance what a torn and damaged soul the killer is; you feel somewhat sympathetic for him.The Silence of the Lambs is a must see, one of the best thrillers you'll ever see."
"THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (1991) **** Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Scott Glenn, Ted Levine, Anthony Heald, Brooke Smith, Diane Baker (Cameos: Roger Corman, producer Kenneth Utt, singer Chris Isaak)   Terrifying masterpiece of modern-day horror and the first film since 1975's ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" to win all 5 major Oscars (Picture, Director: Jonathan Demme, Actress Foster, Actor Hopkins, and Screenplay Adaptation by Ted Tally of the best-seller by Thomas Harris): novice FBI agent Clarice Starling (a stalwart Foster) begins her career in a manhunt for a serial killer known as ""Buffalo Bill"", a transsexual wanna-be whose grisly crimes leads to her only source of his trail: imprisoned psychiatrist Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter (Hopkins in one chilling and modulated perf) whose mindgames with the rookie agent has her on her toes and running out of time.  Exciting, suspenseful and supremely scary with some truly eye-widening moments of the unexpected. Best line: Lecter at film's end: ""I'm having an old friend for dinner."""
"A movie tried to scare me once. I watched it with some chili beans and a nice Pepsi.""Silence of the Lambs"" is one of the true mesmerising movies of the 1990s. It's also genuinely frightening. How many movies can actually call themselves genuinely frightening? Not many.Anthony Hopkins is perfect (read: PERFECT) as Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter. As far as I'm concerned, he overshadows anything. The role is brilliant and scary, made more so by the fact that THE MAN DOES NOT BLINK. Whew! Wipe the sweat off my brow and close my jaw.What a movie. A double whammy. I'm speechless, even. And I'm NEVER speechless. Ask anyone.THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS: ***** (out of Five)"
"""Silence of the Lambs"" is one of those movies a person could watch over and over again and never get bored.  The mixture of acting, screenplay, and direction make it one of the jewels of American cinema."
"Silence of the Lambs is a quintessence of a profound character study and a rare and vivid demonstration of an actor's subtle brilliance and his improvisation in manifestation of a nebulous entity (Lecter), almost single-handedly immortalizing it and in the process elevating himself to a position of unqualified envy and ubiquitous acclaim. In fact, one is likely to suffer, either from inarticulacy or verbosity while describing Anthony Hopkins portrayal of sadistically sophisticated Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Lecter's trademark, his wide open glacial eyes, devoid of any emotion, not only makes him deviously equanimous, but also egregiously peculiar. The fast, slurping-type sound invented by Hopkins that Lecter does, is as fascinating as it is chilling and Lecter's infamous ""Good evening, Clarice"", is as enthralling as it is vicious. Anthony Hopkins's performance is the shortest ever and the most memorable to win an Oscar in the leading category. Hopkins as Lecter, is incontrovertibly and incredibly at the top of his game and it is his brilliance that gets the best out of the other actors, especially Jodie Foster. In fact, it won't be a hyperbole, that Anthony Hopkins's portrayal of cannibalistic Hannibal Lecter in Silence of the Lambs and more so in its sequel, Hannibal (which is my favorite of the series, as the story completely revolves around Lecter, giving him more exposure), is one of the best, the world of cinema has ever seen or offered. In spite of having some of the most gruesomely disturbing and viciously graphic sequences, Silence of the Lambs, is one of the most decorated and enthralling movies of all time. A must watch for avid fans and eclectic viewers.http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/"
"Once upon a crime, Hannibal Lecter was a manipulative psycho-killer compensating for his incarceration by messing with people's minds. Then Hannibal happened and he suddenly turned into a dandy anti-hero... Watching The Silence Of The Lambs again really puts things into perspective. Jonathan Demme's astute adaptation of Thomas Harris' last good book entwines the horror and detective genres to enduringly shocking effect, while Anthony Hopkins' Lecter and Jodie Foster's Starling fizz up an unsettling chemistry that was utterly lacking in the sequel.I haven't seen a movie this perfectly wrapped in a while. I recently re-watched it and it blew me away and it only gets better the more you see it.The performances from everyone are great. Foster sold every scene she was in. But, of course, Hopkins stole every scene he was in and was a powerful anti hero who was scary even when concealed because you know his mind is working at every second. Always planning and he's rarely wrong. His escape was an amazing scene. Levine gives a suitably scary performance but just doesn't stand up to the greatness of Foster and Hopkins.All the characters main characters are deep people are deep people with clear motivations. The police officers are the complete contradiction to this who abuse their power to do what they believe is right, and end up being wrong. It's clever.Everything is wrapped together really well, the performances were great and it's full of memorable scenes.I'm giving The Silence of the Lambs a 10/10."
"That the film has its moments cannot be denied. Hopkins is slightly over-the-top as the diabolical yet urbane Lecter, but it's an enjoyable performance all the same. Lecter's finest moment is when, bound, straightjacketed, and face-masked, he is brought before Senator Martin and, after relentlessly goading her about the fate of her daughter, blurts out the identity of Buffalo Bill and adds, ""Love your suit.""Beyond the superficial appeal of a character who can interject such misanthropic witticisms, Lecter embodies the repulsive seduction of this thoroughly erudite monster, utterly free of societal constraints in spirit if not in body. His intelligence is, if remorseless and amoral, open and searching and methodical. We are time and again shown his superiority to the FBI, who rush hither and yon after clues they don't begin to understand, and to the pettiness of his jailor, Dr. Chilton, who subjects Lecter to televangelist broadcasts as punishment for brutal misbehavior.Yet Lecter is poorly contrasted throughout the film, and his intelligence is falsely elevated by comparison to the unimaginative mediocrities he is up against. Starling is a dreary feminist with a white trash inferiority complex, Dr. Chilton is a preposterously snide asshole, and none of the other characters rise above their status as plot devices. There is something particularly prim and humorless and unlikeable about Starling, and it is impossible to determine why Lecter would take an interest in her childhood trauma about lambs.Several points regarding Lecter's escape make no sense at all, and at crucial stages the total incompetence of his captors is required to pull it off. That Hopkins manages to keep the suspense going is a testament to the actor's ability to rise above the script. Regarding the ultimate capture of Buffalo Bill, it is too much to swallow that Starling's success hinges upon uncovering photographs in the victim's abandoned bedroom years after it had been scoured for evidence by FBI agents. This twist hangs one ridiculous premise on another and is a sorry attempt to justify Starling's centrality to the story.The cinematography and direction do contribute something interesting to the tumultuous descent to Lecter's asylum cell, but are otherwise unremarkable. Buffalo Bill is more bizarre than chilling, and the final confrontation between him and Starling is contrived. The film ends on a note that suggests it could have been alot better.Warning: If you purchase the DVD of THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, resist the urge to listen to Jodie Foster's commentary. While the lambs may be silent, it is next to impossible to get her to shut up. Her grating, man-hating (and totally outdated) style of feminist rhetoric comes close to self-parody, although not often enough to be truly entertaining. Conclusion: this über-bitch is a gaseous windbag. But if you don't believe me, listen for yourself. You'll be saying ""Pass the Chianti"" before you make it through the first reel."
"This film has a silly premise, a lousy script, an implausibility factor of about +100 and a dreadful performance by Anthony Hopkins.  It's the last point that I'll mention about first:  has a more pretentious, breathy performance ever been seen on film before (outside of the Richard Burton oeuvre)?  As for plausibility:  can you imagine the FBI sending a trainee to interview a serial killer, seeking information about another serial killer on the loose?  That was a major flaw in the (also overrated) novel.  I guess it's easier to write about, or make a movie with, a younger woman who's still apt to get all scared-ified and emotional and who doesn't have those annoying crows-feet.  The script is terrible, too--it tries to present Hannibal Lecter as being some kind of 'psychic vampire'.  Witness Hopkins' expression after Jodie Foster tells him her tale of lamb-napping woe--like a famished person who's just been given a good meal.  Give me a break!  And don't tell me that the FBI couldn't have made a connection between the missing skin pieces on the dead girls' bodies and figured out what the loony-tunes they were chasing was doing.  It takes Jodie Foster's character seeing a dress pattern with darts on it to make the connection.  What a group of dim bulbs.  And they wait until HOW MANY young women are killed before they scratch their heads and say, ""Hmmmm, maybe the killer knew one of the victims!""  How did this stupid waste of celluloid ever garner any critical praise?  I mean, I know the Oscars annually bestow 'Best Motion Picture' awards on undeserving titles, so I don't care that this movie won so many--but what were the nation's film critics thinking when this made so many 'Top 10' lists?"
"Silence of the Lambs (1991) follows the story of the young and ambitious Clarice Starling in her attempt to apprehend the serial killer named ""Buffalo Bill"" (Ted Levine). Starling goes to the infamous Hannibal Lecter (nicknamed Hannibal the Cannibal for his exotic tastes). Clarice relies on Lecter for his expertise and knowledge about the mind of a serial killer. Whereas Hannibal toys with Clarice in order to amuse himself. Clarice and her fellow agents are forced to rely on the help of a killer in order to catch another.Jodie Foster does an excellent job playing the young and eager Clarice. She portrays her Southern accent as often painfully obvious, which Lecter pounces upon as an insecurity. Foster speaks with a wavering voice at times, showing Clarice's inexperience and disgust with the crimes committed by Buffalo Bill. Hopkins is completely absorbed into the role of Hannibal Lecter. To create his creepy and psychotic persona he stares unblinkingly, forcing both the audience and Clarice to return his cold gaze. Hopkins keeps as still as possible while acting, looking like a snake poised to pounce upon less intelligent prey, and in comparison to Lecter everyone is less intelligent, and is therefore potential prey. Hopkins keeps a soft smirk on his lips throughout the film as if to say he knows something no one else does. The film's soundtrack is absolutely haunting and mysterious. It works well with the film to create tension and anxiety in the audience. However, the director (Jonathan Demme) knows when silence is just as powerful. In a tense scene in complete darkness we are left with no sound save for the heavy breathing of Buffalo Bill. The cinematography is excellent for this film. The colors of the film are gray and lifeless, which complement the film's dark subject matter. At pivotal moments the camera angle switches to first person. This view works perfectly when Clarice rounds the corner and sees Lecter for the first time. We are able to truly appreciate Lecter's piercing gaze, because we see it first hand through Clarice's eyes. The performances of Hopkins and Foster would have been flat if it were not for the well written script. The small anecdotal stories about Lecter help to build his character even before we meet him. Lecter's lines are meant to sound sophisticated and cultured in order to create his paradoxical character as a gentleman-psychopath. Buffalo Bill refers to his victims as ""it"" in an attempt to destroy their humanity in another example of brilliant writing. A key strength in this film is its character development. Not just Lecter or Clarice's development, but their relationship itself. The audience watches as Lecter and Clarice grow closer and closer in a bizarre exchange not unlike two friends sharing secrets. As Clarice learns more from Lecter, so too does Lecter learn more about Clarice. The audience can see that Lecter values this relationship because he does not hunt her down for as Clarice puts it, ""He would consider that rude"". Silence of the Lambs is a gripping and disturbing film, filled with fascinating characters. It remains a timeless horror film that draws from the darkest and foulest corner of humanity's existence. It is a terrifying movie because it reminds us that the monsters in our world are not imaginary, but could pass us on the street any day."
"""The Silence of the Lambs"" deserves its recognition as a classic and one of only three movies in history to win the ""big 5"" Oscars. The protagonists were brilliantly portrayed. Hopkins very much adds to the story through his creepy performance. His articulate speech and refined southern English accent were jarring as he rarely blinked and calmly expressed his cannibalism. The way Lecter masterfully picked at Starling's insecurities while she tried to get his assistance in finding Buffalo Bill made the character all the more terrifying. Foster, unsurprisingly, is extremely believable as a young woman who wants to prove her worth for her future occupation by tackling the ambitious case. The directing flows smoothly. Great use of extreme close-ups are used to see the actors' emotions and connect with them. The flashbacks were introduced before they seamlessly illustrated the effects Lecter's prodding conversations has on Clarice, making these scenes easy to follow and making Foster's character more of a protagonist. On a side note, I appreciated the conscientious effort made to include a diverse cast in the film, with African- Americans featured prominently in important secondary roles. With that being said, I did feel that the movie was not perfect. The way Clarice finds a lead as to where Buffalo Bill is hiding seemed far- fetched to me. I felt the case could have been further developed before Starling reached the conclusion she arrived to. Moreover, I felt that Buffalo Bill could have used more of a back-story than what is given in order to increase the depth of his character. While some insight is given by Lecter, it is not enough to understand what caused the gender/identity issues that drive Bill to kill. This made his character seem a bit two- dimensional as the antagonist of the film. In contrast, I found Lecter's character rich in depth, as he would be considered a bad guy unless he was helping to find another mentally ill murderer. His character does not hold back his psychopathic ways or complete, self-centered disregard for the well- being of others if it doesn't suit his needs. All in all, this was an incredibly well done film that could probably only be improved if not for time restraints."
"Immeasurably superior to its disappointing sequel ""Hannibal,"" ""Silence of the Lambs"" must surely rank as one of the absolute greatest thrillers of all time. Given the nature of the movie, there is surprisingly little graphic violence contained in it. The story focuses instead on the complex psychological relationship between FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) and the imprisoned cannibalistic serial killer and ex-psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins.) Both Foster and Hopkins are brilliant. Foster has the larger role, and carries it off well, but Hopkins steals the movie with a frighteningly realistic portrayal of a frightening serial killer. Lecter, approached by the FBI because they believe he might be of assistance in helping identify a current serial killer known as ""Buffalo Bill,"" sees in the FBI's interest an opportunity to escape imprisonment, and plays a series of mind games with Starling (and anyone else who wants to speak to him about the case.)Director Jonathon Demme effectively weaves two stories (the hunt for the serial killer, and the Starling-Lecter relationship) together into a taut thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat. And, in the end, has there ever been a better, funnier and more thoroughly chilling line in any movie than Lecter's closing comment to Clarice: ""I have to go now. I'm having an old friend for dinner.""I can't identify a single weakness in this movie. 10/10."
"One of the best movies of the 90's and one of the few thrillers that can match up with Alfred Hitckok's movies.Certainly the perfect choice for the character of Hannibal Lekter, Sir Anthony Hopkins who manages to make the ""cannibal"" a kind of hero. The film won 5 academy awards but in my opinion it worths for more. I would like to stay more in the performance of Anthony Hopkins that is really majestic and gives the film more quality.Hopkins gets to the skin of his role and makes you to feel that he is a real psycho killer.Also the direction is perfect by Demme and makes the viewers to be absorbed by the fight of the FBI agent Clarice Starling and Dr. Hannibal Lecter.Jodie Foster fairly wins the Academy Award for Best Actress in Leading Role."
"It was nothing .. silence of the lambs is such an OVERRATED movie .. doesn't deserve 5 oscars nor the high rating of 8.6 .. When I saw the 8.6 I was like damn this must be good and it will shock me .. but it didn't .. I barely felt anything..The main character (Jodie foster character ) actually annoyed me , she was supposed to be high trained , best of the best , yet when she confronted the criminal , she freaks out and lose it ? , *she was supposed to be high trained*Dr.lecter wasn't scary at all .. I liked him in the first half of the movie .. u would imagine a cannibal who eats his victims ... u think oh he's gonna be a nightmare .. yet no he wasn't .. they portrayed him more like calm smart person ..
The characters was poorly written , we barley even expos and see how the background of each character and what it isThere was a lot of plot holes , for example, when dr lector used the pen .. okay we get it .. but how the hell he managed to take it in the first place ? .. the person who was in charge, kept telling people to be carful and warning them to give him a pen or anything, yet he's the one who was the most careless, and again , lector was tied up , couldn't even move , even when they will in tie him ofcurs they gonna clean his cell from everything, still don't understand how he got the pen .Second plot hole
If he's in high security jail .. how the hell would he manage to run away , how is it high secured when there's no cameras watching him 24/7 , it's confusing how some time they show you that they r super carful with how they treat him .. other minute no one is keeping an eye on him , even the cops , why the hell THE TWO of them needed to be in the cell while feeding him .. he's a dangerous criminal, how can the government put these kind of stupid cops to watch him ..
and when the doctor pushed the other uncuffed cop .. the other one who only has one hand cuffed .. didn't pull a gun and shoot the criminal !! Wtf is that ?Third plot hole :
Why did buffalo bill needed to Load his gun right in front of starling , he had so much time to do it before , why !!
I'll tell u , so starling could hear it and kill him so the story could end .. such a morons
Boring scenes and lots of other scenes that if u skipped them u wont even miss anything
For example, the scene where starling is running after bill
That was WAY TOO LONG
There were many things that were irrelevant to the main story , I wish the movie was all about the canibal dr lector"
"After hearing how great this film is i had to see it for myself. It isn't ""all that"". The story-line is boring and stringy, very much NON-VIOLENT and really really drawn out stalking scenes.I will give credit to the FLAWLESS acting though, Jodie foster and Anthony Hopkins were Outstanding. I really feel that more could have been done with this movie than what they did.The main reason people like this film is because its a ""psychological"" thriller, implying that if you dont like this film you are considered dumb.(which is not the case).This is a very overrated film...very overrated but its worth seeing..so you can say ""I have seen silence of the lambs."" If that doesnt thrill you...dont see it."
"This review contains spoilers, for a spoiler-free version of what I think of this movie, please read the conclusion only. The idea? Pretty good. The acting performances? Definetively great. But, *SPOILER ALERT* am I supposed to ignore that all of a sudden everybody changes their mind about having Lecter under maximum security at the moment he escapes? Hannibal Lecter's escape is one of the most ridiculously unrealistic and stupid things that I've ever seen in a movie as acclaimed as this one. Let's ignore all the stupid things that happen after he kills the two cops and let's just focus on the situation that makes everything ""possible"", in the first place. Just two cops were watching over Lecter. No camera camera surveillance, they didn't even have a radio to immediately inform the rest of the officers if something goes wrong, that or, for some reason, they didn't used such radio when things eventually went wrong. The rest of the officers, ten or more, were just hanging out in the lobby of the building. That's already very stupid and inconsistent with the way the authorities had been treating Lecter all the rest of the movie until that point. But things get even more ridiculous, both officers, totally unconcerned, enter the cell at the same time to give Lecter his meal. The following sequence is so immensely stupid I can't express it correctly with words. If you are of the popular opinion that this movie is one of the greatest thrillers of all time, please, re-watch this scene. After Lecter easily opens his handcuffs with a pen, he proceeds handcuff one of the officers and attack the other with a very effective attack (please note the sarcasm), he bites his face. Yeah, no way to defend against that, especially if you are an armed and trained police officer. The rest of the escape, including the idea of ripping off one of the officer's face and using it as a mask, is, again, immensely stupid, and would obviously never work in real life. This movie is full of ridiculous plot holes that insult the intelligence of the viewer and everything regarding Lecter's escape is beyond stupid and unrealistic. CONCLUSION (spoiler free): Great performances by the leading actors, well directed, and plenty of good, high-tension, entertaining scenes, but if you care about plot consistency and you need this type of films to have a minimum level of realism, this movie isn't for you, and it certainly wasn't for me. 4/10 not worth it. Thanks for reading and sorry for bad English."
"Having read both the Prequel (Manhunter) and Silence of the Lambs, I was looking forward to seeing how the transition to the screen went.A while back ""Manhunter"" was released, and although abridged and with a different (but better) ending, I loved it. Particularly Brian Cox as Hannibal Lecter, soft spoken, analytical and very, very calm. However, always an undercurrent of danger and a mere whisper of insanity.Now on to ""Silence of the Lambs"" - Hannibal Lecter has gone from being an all too believable real-life monster to a giggling Hollywood psycho - a veritable troll complete with his own dungeon (alas, no smoking torches) and a set of eyes wide enough to make Marty Feldman blink.Serial murderers such as this, particularly highly intelligent ones, do not prance about revelling in how evil they are, nor do they speak in such ridiculous snidley tones.They appear quite normal - the reason why they managed to get away with what they did for the length of time they did. Occasionally they speak in monotones and look at nothing in particular. Check out interviews of real-life serial killers - you won't find Anthony Hopkins's fairground pastiche there.The story itself rambled, the interplay between the two characters did'nt work - Hopkins possibly due to the material, Foster due to the lack of a believable protagonist. They have thankfully both done far better work than this both before and since. There were some (very few) well designed moments and images but the end was both predictable and dissapointing.Films are supposed to mirror real life, not the expected perceptions of the mainstream. Otherwise, what happens to creativity?Oh dear - we're back in Hollywood again.Dan"
"The late Gene Siskel hated ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" thinking of it as being far too gruesome and distasteful and as having zero originality to it. Roger Ebert gave the 3.5 out of 4 stars, saying that he did enjoy the film but that some scenes were lacking, such as the ending.Siskel missed the point. The chill from ""The Silence of the Lambs"" doesn't come from revolutionary originality, which it doesn't have. The chill of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is in how it maximizes fear and suspense in a plot that one could simply describe as ""police on the hunt for a serial killer."" It is here where ""The Silence of the Lambs"" set the bar; it takes a B-movie concept and raises it to the level of a taut A-level thriller.The plot has the FBI on the hunt for a serial killer known as ""Buffalo Bill"" (played by Ted Levine). Stuck, the lead investigator (played by Scott Glenn) wants to get the perspective of another serial killer, to try and see inside the psychotic mind. He recruits the young FBI trainee Clarice Starling (played by Jodie Foster) to talk to the brilliant and cannibalistic psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter (played by Anthony Hopkins). Lecter agrees to help Starling, but only if she will grant him the sadistic pleasure of allowing him to see inside her mind.Even though the plot is about Buffalo Bill, with Lecter only having 16 minutes on screen in a 2-hour movie, Lecter and Starling are way more interesting and end up being the driving force for the film. In many films, an excellent performance by the villain can steal the show away from the hero. (Tim Burton's ""Batman,"" featuring a brilliant performance by Jack Nicholson as The Joker, is a prime example of this.) In ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" we have strong performances by both of the lead actors. Hopkins' Lecter is clearly everybody's favorite character, but Foster's performance as Starling is powerful enough to not get eclipsed by Hopkins.Not getting eclipsed is something of a theme for this film. Our heroine is not trying to be heroic. Starling is strong and courageous and could kick anyone's butt, and yet she comes across as vulnerable. She is a woman in a man's world and everywhere she goes, there is a sense of being dominated. She is 5'3"" in a film where most other characters are over 6' tall. (The camera often skillfully has Starling occupying only the lower half of the frame; seeing so much space above her head makes her look shorter and more vulnerable.) Her black hair (which is different from Foster's natural light brown) makes her appear paler than she really is. Other characters are always hitting on her. She always whispers and is always giving a nervous smile. Even her slight Southern accent gives her a ""country girl"" appeal that helps the audience identify with her. Starling is an FBI agent-in-training and is clearly quite skilled at handling dangerous situations, but she still shares our vulnerabilities. As a result of this, her fears are our fears. This is the true skill of Jodie Foster's performance; she manages to play Starling as a woman of great strength and vulnerability at once.Credit should also go to the film-makers. One strong point is their choice to only be selectively gruesome. This is one key difference between ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and garden-variety serial killer movies. The latter often derive their scares by showing incredibly brutal images and portraying utterly disgusting scenarios. Fear is generated by the audience's own horrified reaction to what is being shown on screen. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" does not give in to that temptation though. It casually shows us several rather gruesome images to get us nervous, but then keeps some of the most disturbing stuff cleverly off-camera. Of course, this serves to only make them scarier; what could be so gruesome that not even this creepy film is willing to show it on camera? I do have criticisms. My main complaint is that Buffalo Bill is a lightweight who left me longing for the much more interesting and menacing Hannibal Lecter. Buffalo Bill is sick, twisted, and downright nauseating, but he also is a coward, who has to resort to trickery and gadgetry to make himself formidable. Lecter, on the other hand, has all the tools he needs right there in his brain. He is the smartest character in the film and he knows it and he loves it. He is so charismatic that he can enter the mind of anyone, no matter how hard they resist. This makes Lecter scary even when he is off-camera. Buffalo Bill is not really all that scary even when he's on camera; he's more just plain gross.The thrill of this movie is psychological. We don't feel thrilled because of cool action sequences or original plot ideas but rather because of the fear that we can relate to and the mind games that Lecter plays. Something of a void is left in scenes in the latter half of the film, where Lecter is absent. (Here, I agree with Ebert.) Nonetheless, Foster's performance makes up for that. Even in the final showdown with Buffalo Bill, the thrill is still there because we feel Starling's fear, even though the audience has not been particularly scared of Buffalo Bill up until now. (Here, I disagree with Ebert, who feels the showdown is lacking.) ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is thrilling and chilling. The main villain is a lightweight, but the secondary villain is among the most menacing and evil in cinema history. I think that after we walk away from this film, we somehow are left with the feeling that, at least for those 2 hours, Hannibal Lecter managed to get inside our own minds as well."
"Finally, I saw this movie for the first time yesterday. I bet everyone has already seen it, but just in case: Spoilers Below!I've always heard and read that SILENCE OF THE LAMBS was a great movie, but I'd never seen it. Now I have, and I've learned that it wasn't all hype.Silence of the Lambs is about an FBI-trainee named Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) who is trying to track down and stop a serial killer named Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine) who has been killing girls throughout the country. In order to do so, she questions Dr. Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins). Dr. Lector is a brilliant physiologist who is a convicted serial killer. He appears polite, but is actually a very dangerous and intelligent psychopath who eats his victims.I can't express how great I thought this movie was. Just about every scene with Anthony Hopkins was mesmerizing, especially his dialogue with Jodie Foster. The last conversation between the two in this movie was chilling to the bone. Dr. Lector's escape was probably the greatest scene in the movie, while also one of the most disturbing. When he beats a helpless guard to death with a nightstick, it reminds you that he is not the harmless man that he looks like.Anthony Hopkins, of course, stole the show. He stole every single scene he was in. Jodie Foster did a very good job also as the young, ambitious FBI trainee trying to put an end to another madman's reign and, in doing so, smother the pains of her past. Ted Levine also did a notable job as another very different madman than Lector. I sincerely hated Levine's character by the end of this movie.There are many memorable scenes in this movie. The prison break, as I mentioned earlier, is one of the more memorable ones. The most intense scene of the movie, in my opinion, is when Jodie Foster is being stalked in the dark near the end of the film. Anytime that Lector talks, you will probably feel shivers up your spine. This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. If like me, you have not seen it in all these years, do it today. There is a reason this movie is a favorite of many people and crosses many genres."
"Silence of the Lambs was the birthplace of Anthony Hopkins's Hannibal Lecter, one of the finest monsters ever screened. Although this is the middle film in the trilogy, it was made first and remains the finest in the set.Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is a highly intelligent, very vulnerable young FBI trainee. With a serial killer named Buffalo Bill increasing his body count. Clarice is sent by Jack Crawford (Scott Glen) to attempt to gain any information that she can from Dr. Hannibal Lecter (A brilliant, yet Insane Psyciatrist known as Hannibal the Cannibal) Starling has to gain Lecter's trust, by engaging in very dangerous mind games with the Doctor, and the last person you want in your head is Hannibal Lecter, but without his help, Buffalo Bill's victims will stand no chance.Foster and Hopkins have a very strong on screen chemistry, and both portray their characters brilliantly, making them realistic and believable. The Scenery matches the mood of the movie, very dark and gloomy for much of the time, and the pockets of suspense interlaced with some imaginative psychological horror make Silence of the Lambs a movie that sets the standard, and the standard is high.10/10"
"Despite the impressive credentials this so-called thriller is nothing more than quality exploitation with highbrow pretensions, none of which can patch the many plot holes and jarring improbabilities. The script presents an awkward adaptation of what must have been a much fuller (if equally unpleasant) novel, compressing the material with too many transparent narrative gaps and shortcuts, including some amazing FBI deductions worthy of Sherlock Holmes.The idea of using one psychopath to help catch another is intriguing, but having two serial killers dilutes the impact of the story, especially when it focuses more on cartoon cannibal Anthony Hopkins, already in custody until his illogical, unlikely escape. Nothing much is learned about the other killer-at-large (an apparent reject from a David Lynch freak-show), and the film ends as a typical damsel-in-distress drama with haunted house shock effects.The screenplay is overloaded with bogus psychological significance and padded with irrelevant flashbacks, and the film was shot entirely in blunt, video-format close-ups, with director Jonathan Demme apparently trying to get inside the mind of his characters by simply shoving the camera in their faces. The manhunt is also highlighted by a gratuitous excess of explicit gore, but that doesn't stop it from having a happy ending, for everyone involved, including cannibal/killer Hannibal Lecter."
"It is certainly the most overrated movie ever.. and it is the first to depict super serial killers as real believable stuff.. let me say something, it is a B movie pretending to be a first class movie.. people must understand a simple thing, super serial killers are B MOVIE STUFF! Movies like Friday 13th or those with Freddy Krüger.. those are typical B movie where there is a super serial killer.Don't get me wrong, I like B movies.. I like how a B movie director struggle against time and budget to make a piece of entertainment.. I liked the first two Jason movies and that first Freddy movie.. they have the suspense of a B horror movie.. they are true B movies. Those Silence of the Lambs guys got a money to make an A movie and made a B movie, period.The plot is just absurd, there is a serial killer on the loose.. and a investigator tries find help with another serial killer, the super one, who is in jail.. I don't know exactly what kind of help an investigator would ask for a jailed man.. but it is what the movie is based on. Although the free serial killer could be anywhere.. the super serial killer uses his super powers to help that FBI investigator to find him.. but he likes to play with that female investigator and then he uses his superpowers to read her mind and find out everything about her life. He doesn't tell everything once, he gives her hints about the serial killer whereabout.. so she gotta come over and over again to him to beg some more hints.. it is stupid, I know, but that is one the most praised movies ever.It is like asking a jailed Freddy Kruger to fight Jason because they can't defeat him.. it is something like that.. if you make a real analysis of that sh*t. And it is not a thriller at all, and has a lot of highly laughable absurd bits.Unfortunately it created a trend people seems to like too much.. the super serial killer movie pretending to be a serious one, not a B movie which it indeed is."
"This is another movie that glorifies psychopathic behaviour. The bad guy is portrayed as an intelligent, witty, stylish, calculated guy while the investigators are shown as weak-minded, emotional, imprudent persons. One almost feels sorry(or maybe angry) for the FBI guys for being so incompetent. How can the screenplay for such a movie get 5 Oscars? The acting is not that great either, Anthony Hopkins is overplaying his lines while Jodie Foster is barely acting at all. She doesn't seem to change mimic during the whole movie and the whole story with the lambs is just lame. Some psychopaths are known to be good to animals, so saving some lambs doesn't automatically make you a noble and unique person, someone that can make the world a better place."
First its not a thriller.... because it doesn't thrill but just tells a simple story... 2nd... plot holes are way too many to ruin the entire film up...Dr lectarz escape... how can you be so casual with a highly dangerous criminal.... you go in to give food to him.... and no cameras watching over.. wow...Finding the house of buffalo bill... well pretty lucky find i would say... i should be in FBI if it is all to work with luck Killing Him... MY GOD... with the night goggles on watching her from a distance he wouldn't kill her... wouldn't even load the gun beforehand... but would go all the way near her to load the gun so that she can hear it and shoot him... he is the most stupid killer i have ever seen.and without those 3 plot holes... you wouldn't have the end to the story... its like getting stuck with the story and then you don't know how to end it... so you just make luck do all the work and finish of the job... no clues... no thinking... just pure luck and a stupid stupid villain...
"The Silence of The Lambs explores the life and mind of Clarice Starling, a female FBI agent who has a lot of issues to deal with. Somehow by fate, she ends up meeting Hannibal Lector, and they strike up a very unusual relationship. The most interesting parts in the movie deal with the 2 of them just talking.The highlight of the movie is obviously Anthony Hopkins' performance. He's delightfully creepy as Hannibal. The whole suspense of the character is thinking he's about to do something violent, since throughout the movie you only hear stories about the terrible things he's done. When he finally does do something, it really pays off because it's one of the scariest and most memorable parts in the movie.The Silence Of The Lambs appeals to many people. That's because it can be viewed from so many angles, and that's why it's become a part of our pop-culture. I'm not going to write any longer, because I'm having an old friend for dinner.My rating: 10/10"
"This film scared the crap out of me the first time I saw it, and considering how many horror/suspense films I had seen by that point, that's no small matter. At the same time I was giving my nervous system a workout, I was sitting there in awe of how well written the film was, how excellently defined and sketched all the characters were, how intellectually challenging the piece was, and how unbelievably good Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins performances were- thank God they both won Oscars. Frankly, I was disappointed to learn that there would be a sequel, as I think this film, and its story, stand so well on their own and need no elaboration. As excellent and terrifying as JAWS, only with people... which is somehow even scarier, once you really start to think about. I worry the sequels will run the way of JAWS 2, 3D, and THE REVENGE."
"The young FBI agent Clarice went to visit the in-jail horrible killer Hannibal in order to solve the series-killer-case. Clarice was afraid of him. She also had the psychological problem that haunted her from the childhood. Although Hannibal treated her with consideration, what he had done was so cruel that nobody could imagine. The strange chemistry reaction happened between them since their first meeting.Hannibal's action embodied the complexity of humanity. He was gentle to Clarice. However he was so brutal to the other people. You cannot believe that was done by the same person. Sometimes we do know little about ourselves.It was rare to see that a movie won the best actor and actress (the academy award) at the same time. It just proved that it was Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster made the movie so outstanding. No one can deny their wonderful performance. The following Hannibal and Red dragon had lost the original idea and could not achieve the astonishing effect that TSOTL brought us.A thriller classic. 9/10"
"Came into this movie expecting to be scared out of my wits by Anthony Hopkins (Hannibal Lecter) performance; a pretense resulting from many many top 10 lists of ""Chilling performances"" or ""Best movie Psychopaths "" boy was I let down. For the 90s it may have been unique and freaky, but i really couldn't attain what all the constant hype is about, yes there are some tense moments here and there but Lecters character is really inconsistently acted out for half of his screen time. Don't really believe in being pretentious in this context but if you payed attention to Lecters dialogue you would see one moment he is a to the core amoral being who does not feel one iota of sympathy for humanity and the next he is interested in some rookie FBI agents childhood and not to mention infatuated enough to create art pieces of her, excuse me if i am mistaken but this is a chronic sociopath who eats humans. I don't know if you've watched interviews with psychopaths or insane persons but i can assure you none of them behave the way Lecter does and please spare me the ""but that's what makes him so different and ""good"" "". The writers who came up with Lecters lines got way too artsy by letting their creative exhibition blanket the brutal reality the character was meant to portray. Lecter was intriguing and enigmatic for the first few minutes of his appearance but his mysteriousness and guise got completely obliterated as the writers gave too much away too quickly leaving nothing to further entice the viewer on the central character. Other major detractors regarding Lecter included the scene where he escapes a HIGH SECURITY complex SURROUNDED by ARMED and TRAINED personal which was supposedly ""blocked off for 10 block"" or something along those lines, keep in mind that Lecter had been locked in a cell for 8 years straight, talk about muscle atrophy right? the man suddenly had the strength to scale fences and walls while avoiding only a couple dozen patrols...Buffalo Bill was just a medium for the movie creators to include shock material: close ups on his nipple ring, full nude frontal shot, dialogue of him saying he wants to copulate with himself and something about putting the lotion in the basket? the effect of that sentence was much more profound in South Park. Buffalo Bill was not even minutely interesting or relevant it just seems they added him their just to fill in some blanks and add in some really ""ewwy"" moments. The ending scene where Lecter calls Starling is just a redundant and rubbish attempt to further strengthen the absolute awkward bond between relationship they had and also I'm guessing they wanted an excuse to include Lecter again before the credits rolled, I'm not sorry to say this but the only decent thing about the ending was when Lecter commented he was going to have ""dinner"" with his past captor. The characters in this movie were just very poorly written and implemented, the acting was believable but thats not even 1/4 of what makes a movie ""good"". I know i missed out on Jodie Fosters character oh and could i go on but i really feel likes there are enough negatives here to indicate just how overly high rated this movie is . Lecter could have been portrayed so much more ferociously and searingly through presence and psychologically alone rather than having mens extremities ripped off or them beaten to a pulp. Joker from Christopher Nolans movie is probably the epitome of an antagonist with an unstable mental state (no I'm not a 13 year old emo who's favourite is unquestionably the joker) and i might even mention the main antagonist from I Saw the Devil that is also a very raw representation of how a psychopath might function in real life.The Buffalo Bill character could have been implemented more naturally as opposed to having it seem like there are two points of focus in the movie (Lecter and Bill). The movie really needed to end on a much more satisfying note and don't get me wrong i have seen plenty of films where the ending is ambiguous but Silence Of The Lambs was just the protagonist receiving a phone call at a party and Lecter walking off into a crowd of people as Sarling sobs i mean come on it would have been better to just end it after Bill was slain. I would give the movie 1/10 to ever so slightly balance the overall score but 7/10 for having some depth and substance to it despite being majorly overrated and just a mediocre film."
"THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is, quite simply, a breathtaking movie. It's the granddaddy of all serial killer flicks, a film that even the almost-as-good SE7EN can only aspire to, a movie that gets into the mind and soul of a serial killer like few others. It inspired a huge sub-genre of similar movies that came out during the 1990s and 2000s, and it's up there with Hitchcock's PSYCHO as one of the most gripping looks at the subject matter of all time.Where to begin? There's a pitch-perfect Jodie Foster, gradually leading us into the depths of the storyline as the naive FBI agent, and the oft-overlooked Ted Levine who excels as the supremely skin-crawling Buffalo Bill. Of course, the film is dominated by Anthony Hopkins, giving the best and most memorable performance of his career in just 16 minutes of screen time. Hopkins chills you to the bone in this, and Jonathan Demme's direction is a perfect match for his talents.The storyline is engaging, ably mixing the criminal investigation strands with scenes involving the killers themselves. There are gory and monstrous set-pieces which make your flesh crawl while watching, yet it's all rather restrained and intellectual, a surprise given the subject matter. Most importantly, it's never less than gripping and completely frightening. A true masterpiece of a movie."
"The acting is of a very high level. Foster put down a good role as Clarice Starling and the supporting cast was very good (think of Buffalo Bill, for example). The star of the show is Anthony Hopkins. The role he put down here is really nothing less than genius. The dude is perfectly cast and is both friendly and polite, and very creepy and smart about it. I think it's an incredibly and fascinating character. Hannibal is for me one of the best psychopaths I've ever seen in a movie.Overall I highly recommend this movie if you love thrillers and detectives because this is definitely one of the best in its category for me. And i think this movie is also in my top 10 films!!"
"I have been fascinated by this movie from the first time I saw it! To me, I felt connected to agent starling, I don't know if everyone gets the relationship between Clarice, and the most profound impact that living with her relatives during the slaughter season of the ""lambs"", had on her as a person. I think anyone that has ever experienced any kind of abandonment, helplessness, and just feeling terror in general,as she did, when she tried to save that one lamb; and couldn't, well, it just makes you cry, because you see the helplessness of her past, meeting her once again in her present!As she fought to help the victim, she had to overcome the victim within herself, as well.I loved Jodie Foster in this movie, and I can't pass up an opportunity to watch it again and again!I love her dialect, her acting, and; the way that she pulled the movie together!"
"""The Silence of The Lambs"", simply one of the greatest films ever made. Swept all five major academy awards, only ever done twice before (One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, It Happened That Night).It centres on a young FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) who becomes increasingly obsessed with solving the the murders of a deranged killer known only as ""Buffalo Bill"" thanks to hid trademark of skinning his victims. Starling is mentored by the brilliant intelligent yet atrociously psychopathic Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lector.The two protagonists have a number of exchanges throughout the film which unyielded dark and unsettling personal disturbances that Starling experienced in the past where she witnessed the slaughtering of innocent spring lambs juxtaposed with their terrifying screams. This is an extremely powerful image and connotation in the film as Starling believes that capturing ""Buffalo Bill"" will be silencing the lambs and ultimately silencing the soul-shattering experiences of her orphaned childhood.There are a variety of effective techniques employed by director Jonathan Demme such as extreme close-ups of Dr. Lector to illuminate the madness in his eyes and the unsettling rhythm of his breathing. These are few of the elements that contribute in Anthony Hopkins delivering the performance of his career as Lector.The first time Starling visits Lector in his cell is outstandingly effective. Just by the camera gliding slowly past the other institutionalised psycho's, it builds slowly up the true madman, Lecot. He stands still in the centre of his cell, staring at Starling. Spine-chilling and brilliant. One of the most effective techniques I have ever noticed in a film.The film does have its gory moments, which is fine considering that it deals heavily with serial killers and cannibals so it is nothing that exceeds expectations.But it's the performances that make this film simply incredible. Hopkins is extraordinarily creepy as Hannibal Lector where as Jodie Foster portrays such vulnerable courage, such fear and determination. Both were well deserved of their Oscars as was the film and Demme for his Best Director Award.The film's ending is exciting and well wrapped-up which is always a positive in any film and compliments the rest of the film beautifully as every scene comes dripping with intensity, drama and wondrous camera work.This a genuine cinematic accomplishment that has spawned sequels and prequels that are respectable in their own right but will never match up to the brilliance of Hopkins, Foster and co.10/10 True masterpiece!"
The story was really good but production and direction was hideous ...
"A serial killer nicknamed ""Buffalo Bill"" (Ted Levine) gains even more notoriety after kidnapping a woman by the name of ""Catherine Martin"" (Brooke Smith) who happens to be the daughter of United States Senator ""Ruth Martin"" (Diane Baker). Although he hasn't cooperated since his arrest and conviction for several grisly murders, a former psychiatrist named ""Dr. Hannibal Lector"" (Anthony Hopkins) is persuaded to do so by a young FBI agent-in-training named ""Clarice Starling"" (Jodie Foster). But with time on his side any assistance he gives will come at a very high price. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a fascinating movie from start to finish with Academy Award winning performances rendered by both Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster. It also won the Academy Award for ""Best Picture"" as well. In any case, I highly recommend this film for those who might enjoy a movie of this type and I have rated it accordingly."
"Silence of the Lambs is an awesome movie. It is perfectly written and the actors who played buffalo bill (Ted Levine) and Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) were extremely good choices. Buffalo Bill is the perfect mix of Ed Gein, Ted Bundy, Gary Heidnik, Edmund Kemper, etc. Even though it is mainly a serious movie, it does have some funny parts to it which gives a genuine but interesting outlook to what all of these serial killers actually did. Although it is over 20 years old, it doesn't have the typical 'campy' humor/feel that most 90 movies had (I love campy movies though so that wouldn't have been much of a problem, personally). Its the perfect mix of creepy and wonderful. I would recommend it fully."
"The Silence of the Lambs (1991): Dir: Jonathan Demme / Cast: Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Scott Glenn, Ted Levine, Diane Baker: Psychological thriller where the film's core regards interrogation of evil without physical contact. Female victims are found skinned by Buffalo Bill and Hannibal Lector is believed to be able to identify him but every agent who has approached his realm of confinement has been led astray. The Senator's daughter is kidnapped so a female F.B.I. trainee is issued in hopes that Lector will give in to a female. We learn about her through Lector's ability to trespass the mind. Shocking thriller directed by Jonathan Demme who also made Melvin and Howard. Anthony Hopkins brilliantly demonstrates Lector's sly methods of penetrating the mind. He delights in toying with victims, which is why his brutal escape occurred. Jodie Foster is excellent as the young trainee haunted by her father's death. She is intelligent and brave particularly when dealing with Bill in the shocking climax. Ted Levine is monstrous as Buffalo Bill whose one breaking point arrives when the Senator's daughter gets hold of his dog. Scott Glenn is standard as the agent in charge of the case but instrumental at a wrong address. Diane Baker plays a Senator whose daughter is kidnapped by Buffalo Bill. Penetrating thriller will shock your nerves and silence your senses. Score: 9 ½ / 10"
"a good film. for psychological scenes, for Anthony Hopkins who does a fascinating anti-hero step by step, with precise science of detail, for the duel between the lead characters, for the great way to transform a thriller in gem exploring each image , word and look possibility. a film who impose to viewer a rhythm of events who seems be a form of spell. so, a masterpiece and that status has as seed the science to be after each view, profound different , a new experience. Jodie Foster does a magnificent role and it is not a real surprise. but the dialog with the doctor Lecter of young Starling is one of rare moments of pure fascination , like a game of shadows or trip in the mind of viewer. because it is not exactly a film. but a form of experience. not ordinary but so convincing that it dares be an useful lesson about old things in new powerful light."
"Very well directed with a heavy and ominous tone that shadows the entire movie. The sound and editing all function in creating and maintaining the film's eerie atmosphere. Reviewing this film, how could one not mention Anthony Hopkins chilling and creepy performance as Dr. Hannibal Lecter. He portrays, without a doubt, one of the best psychotic characters in cinema history. He's so good that at one point, you may start to, dare I say, root for him? The chemistry between Hopkins and Jodie Foster's character is brilliant and the dialogue between them is masterfully crafted. Once you let Hannibal into your mind, you can never get him out. After watching The Silence of the Lambs, I don't think I can ever forget it. Are you up for the challenge?"
"The Silence of the Lambs is one of the rare horror films that convinced much of the American public, and even the Academy Awards, that horror doesn't have to always be about gore, excess violence, and extremism. In fact, horror can stem from many different aspects, one of them being psychological, which is the subgenre that the film caters to. Through use of strong acting and an interesting story, the film manages to explain why it etched itself into the list of greatest American films ever made simply by existing and going what nobody thought its own genre could do.The film stars Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, who is pulled from her training at an FBI academy by Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn), who works for a unit in behavioral sciences. Jack grants Clarice the honor of meeting one-on-one with former psychiatrist and serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), who is also known for cannibalistic crimes. Lecter's knowledge is requested because of a serial killer nicknamed ""Buffalo Bill"" currently running rampant in the streets, who is highly-publicized and known to skin the corpses of his female victims.Upon arriving at the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, Clarice meets a surprisingly mannered and well-articulate man that is Hannibal Lecter and not the psychotic murderer one would believe. What unravels is a strange relationship between an FBI trainee and an insane mental patient. Starling has to get close to Lecter for his knowledge and insight into the crimes of ""Buffalo Bill,"" but also must refrain from dangerously close connections which could instantly spark something detrimental to her well-being.The first thing to marvel at with this film is how it utilizes its talent, plunging Foster and Hopkins into a story and set of circumstances that need to be well acted in order to be believable and gripping; both veteran talents do not slump here. Foster gives a very solid performance as Clarice, that is mostly successful at avoided the often alienating tropes that result when we focus on cops or undercover investigators for two hours. Then there's Hopkins, in a role he has become known for for good reason. Hopkins instantly clicks here as Lecter, provoking fright and unsettled nerves with viewers. Rather than over-the-top zaniness, Lecter relies on quiet, mannered acting techniques that are all the more frightening because of how out of the ordinary and unexpected they are from a man of his caliber. This leads the viewer to ping-pong back and forth with the idea that Lecter is really a misunderstood victim or an amazingly talented con-artist.Then there's the mounting tension on display here, largely thanks to Jonathan Demme's direction and Ted Tally's screenplay. The film plays like a true detective story, utilizing slowburn and patient tension in order to achieve a great, suspenseful result. These kinds of films hold up because they deliver something new each time one sees them. This being my first time viewing The Silence of the Lambs one gets the idea that even after seeing it, watching it again would be a great experience because it would allow you to pay more attention to the serene details of the film and how the end result came to be.With strong work behind the camera, and equally strong work in front, there's really no shock that The Silence of the Lambs came out the way it did, a strong and capable psychological thriller/horror film that beautifully relies on nuances and mannerisms rather than shock and awe. The fact that the film may have lead some to look at the horror genre with a bit more respect in the short-run would maybe be a stronger statement if horror didn't go south in the long-run. But that's another blog/review for another time.Starring: Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Scott Glenn, and Ted Levine. Directed by: Jonathan Demme."
"Thomas Harris's book has been reinvented for cinema. And its fantastic!The film has everything a good thriller should have. A solid script, nerve racking tension, a relatable protagonist and fearfully clever antagonist. Anthony Hopkins (Hannibal) does A tremendous job at portraying his psychotic, menacing role, he truly is the star of the show. Its even better than the film and needs to be seen by everyone!This was just a brief revue about some of my basic impressions of the film, however i really do hope you have enjoyed this masterpiece as much as I have.LOL LINES ARE FUN meowmeowmeowmeowmeow"
"""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a movie in which a young FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) tries to get some information from Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) who is a psychopath and used to be a respected psychiatrist, for a psychopathic serial killer who skins his victims. To get these information Clarice Starling has to gain the respect and the trust of Dr.Hannibal Lecter.When I saw this movie I thought that Anthony Hopkins is really not OK in his minds for real and that's because of his perfect interpretation. I also think that Jodie Foster made an also perfect interpretation. Τhese were seen and in the Academy Awards where Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster won the Oscars for Best Actor in a Leading Role and for Best Actress in a Leading Role respectively. Jonathan Demme's work in the direction of this film did not go unnoticed and he also won the Oscar for Best Director.""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a movie that you have to see it, it's a really good Thriller and Crime movie with many good scenes and an exceptional screenplay."
"Because of The Silence of the Lambs comes some much needed identification for the horror category. It is a first-rate production all around. It boasts a witty and dramatic script based on the Thomas Harris novel, full of great lines. It has marvelous direction from Demme. Demme creates suspense very well throughout and uses some great directorial shots such as the twin frames of Clarice ringing a doorbell and the FBI men breaking into a home. The two lead actors won Oscars for their performances...each deserved. Foster is very good in her role, but it is Anthony Hopkins that literally lights up the screen with his complex portrayal of a complex serial killer. Hopkins does the seemingly impossible. He frightens you with his outrageousness and yet forbidden some pity/compassion(albeit not a lot) for his situation. He says his lines with reservedness when needed and brashness when needed. The rest of the cast is also quite good with Anthony Heald a standout as a unethical, petty doctor in charge of Hopkins. Of course the story of the other killer is very very chilling as well. A quality film in all aspects!"
"Anthony Hopkins creates a character who is intelligent, calm, calculating, charming and.....he enjoys eating people. (a slight personalty flaw !!). This is a completely compelling man...who loves the ""high arts"", is articulate ...is a Doctor...but beef ,pork , chicken and lamb ..just don't ""do it"" for him. Dr Lecter needs that pure unmistakable taste of homo sapien. The Lecter persona has become as big as any movie ""legendary character"".(we must remember--of course--he IS a monster !!) The movie does have a few flaws here and there , but Silence of the Lambs is a really great psycho thriller. Made in 1991, it remains a landmark motion picture. Hopkins was born to play Lecter....One feels almost hypnotized when those bright eyes are sparkling (or if he appears hungry)."
"What separates this movie from other horror movies is, nowadays horror movies have lots of gore and blood. But this one had scary dialog, and real suspense. Hannibal Lecter really got me! I mean he was described as a psychopath and he looked calm, then he showed us his true colors!""Buffalo Bill"" was crafty and crazy! The only thing he shows affection for is his poodle ""Precious"" Clarice Starling proved that she has what it takes to be a professional when she used her skills to track down the sadistic ""Buffalo Bill"".For these reasons and more this movie will remain a suspenseful masterpiece."
"In simple language the movie is truly remarkable. The direction of the movie is simply awesome and I loved the screenplay as well. The conversations between Starling and Hannibal Lekter are shot so well and dialogs are written so fine that even though the character of Hannibal don't appear much but still its the one that you'll never forget. Even the character of Buffalo Bill is very much creepy but Lekter wins for me. Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal has delivered a stunning performance. Jodie Foster has also done a good job. The psycho-thriller theme is well established throughout the movie. Its creepy in a sense. The movie is nearly perfect in every aspect. Even the background score settles well enhancing the environment. Its one of the movie you won't forget. Though the character was introduced first in manhunter, its now that it marks its true nature. I would really recommend it to all."
"The Silence Of The Lambs is one of those movies that you don't ever want to be finished. The story/plot is intriguing, involving, interesting and makes you stay in the edge of your seat. The crazy characters are very believable and I was very afraid when Clarice was going to meet him for the first time.Anthony Hopkins did a great job at portraying a nuts psychiatrist and sociopath. He did so well that I find it hard to imagine him as a normal person outside the movie.Ted Levine was as good as Hopkins at portraying another crazy man. Also, he was very brave to play a ""transsexual"" man back in 1991 when nobody knew what it was about.The creepy feelings we get throughout this movie are worth a watch in a rainy dawn, I surely recommend this to thriller lovers."
"I had read this book by Thomas Harris and thought it would make a great movie but was concerned when I heard that Jonathan Demme was making it. How wrong I was though and I was overwhelmingly surprised. It was the first film about a serial killer where it did not rely on strong elements of violence and gore but simply left it to the imagination. Obviously Hopkins and Foster get all the plaudits and rightly so but this is one of the only films that has so many superb minor characters such as Barney, Ardelia Mapp and Bill himself. I urge those who like this movie to watch the making of documentary as it is truly fascinating. A roller-coaster ride of emotions and tension which I enjoy every time I watch it."
"The Silence of the Lambs is the only Horror genre movie to win the Best Picture Oscar. Both its male and female lead have won the Oscars for their performances. Sir Anthony Hopkins holds the record for the shortest on-screen role to get the Lead Oscar award. He hardly spends 16-18 minutes on screen and produces magic. These factoids and the well deserved high rating on IMDb was what drove me to watch this movie. And at no point of time, I felt that the movie enjoyed more praise that it deserved. It is a brilliantly done movie that deserves all the cheers and applause. Jodie Foster is one my favorite actresses of all times. Her work in Contact, Flightplan, Anna and the King and other movies was praise worthy. And her role in Silence of the Lambs is perhaps her best role ever. She plays an FBI trainee who has been sent by the FBI to try and talk to Dr. Hannibal Lecter and seek his help in finding a serial killer. Dr. Hannibal Lecter is a serial killer himself, a brilliant psychiatrist with extremely intellectual insight into the human mind. Agent Starling is scared of her interaction with this madman Lecter. And you are scared of him because she is scared too. One of the very few actors who can show fear so beautifully on her face. She faces situations everyday in her life where is ends up being the only female in a room full of men. This no doubt is a source of discomfort for her and you can see it all over her face. Dr. Hannibal Lecter is not an average serial killer. He is a brilliant psychiatrist. His understanding of the human mind and his skill to dissect your thoughts by observing your facial expressions and listening to your voice is demonstrated early on in the movie. He is willing to help Agent Starling catch the serial killer but in return wants to diagnose her for he in her past he sees a tragic set of events that have contributed and are still contributing to her life. The game is on! Lecter gives his insights to Starling in exchange for her honest and candid information about her childhood. Every tiny aspect of this interaction is handled so wonderfully. The director Jonathan Demme does not fail in any aspect. He builds the perfect package. The eventual track down of the serial killer, the suspense and the overall story is so well done. At no point of time does he resort in showing something that makes the movie conventional or unrealistic. The movie grips you with fear and keeps you at the edge of your seat till the very end of it. The movie is not about the serial killer and his mind but it is more about Agent Starling and her peculiar relationship with Dr. Lecter. But that still does not allow Demme to ignore his development and portrayal. The serial killer is believable and complex in his own right.This movie is a classic. It is destined to be in the list of great movies for a very long time to come. And I am sure that should any actor try to step in the shoes of either of these characters, he or she would be taking a very big risk indeed. The characters are so strong that it is hard to imagine any other Agent Starling other than Foster and any other Dr. Hannibal than Sir Anthony Hopkins. (I'd recommend you see The Manhunter to see another actor try playing Dr. Hannibal and see for yourself.)A must watch for all movie fans! Cheers!"
"""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a genuine suspense thriller that is sure to satisfy anyone who enjoys a good old crime thriller. Jodie Foster brilliantly plays Clarice Starling, a strong willed, ""tough girl type"" FBI trainee, whose job is to track down a notorious serial killer by the name of ""Buffalo Bill"", who is kidnapping and slaying young women in the area. While investigating, in hopes of finding the killer, Clarice meets Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), an incarcerated, blood-thirsty cannibal who holds information as to the whereabouts of Buffalo Bill. Clarice and Hannibal begin to form a strange relationship as she seeks him for help to find the serial killer and stop him before he kills his latest victim.Easily one of the best and most sophisticated crime thrillers I've seen, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is an excellent movie. To begin, the performances are what really shine here. Both Foster and Hopkins are award-worthy (and I believe Hopkins won an Academy Award for his portrayal of the malevolent Hannibal Lecter). Jodie Foster is completely believable in her role as the intelligent heroine, and really has the audience sympathizing with her. On the other hand is Lecter, wonderfully played by Hopkins - his character is one scary guy, I definitely wouldn't want to be near him. Their chemistry in the film is amazing, and the conversational scenes between them, both of them separated by bars or a glass wall, are tense and brilliantly acted. The performances all around are simply top-notch.The plot itself is an intriguing one at that, and I liked the relationship that was formed between the FBI agent and the serial killer - it's all really interesting. Then, there's the serial killer that is the sole reason that Clarice has any relation to Lecter - because Lecter has information that could help her. The gender-bending Buffalo Bill is shown throughout the movie, kidnapping women, and the viewers get an insight into his bizarre world, mostly shown in his underground ""chamber"" under his house, where he skins and stores his victims, dead and alive, and wears their skins. The finale in the pitch-black basement/lair between Clarice and Buffalo Bill is genuinely terrifying, and will surely have you on the edge of your seat. Really one of the creepiest scenes that I've seen in a movie.Overall, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a movie that you won't want to miss. The performances alone are enough reason to watch this film, Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are absolutely amazing. On top of that, it is a truly scary film and one of the most suspense-ridden thrillers out there. A definite must see. 10/10."
"Every once in a while, a film is released which revives its dead genre. In the early '90s, for the horror/thriller genre, The Silence of the Lambs was that film. After a tribe of awful horror flicks (e.g. 1988's Child's Play) with recycled story lines like serial killers hunting dumb teens, The Silence of the Lambs took the serial killer movie to a new level.The Silence of the Lambs swept the 1991 Academy Awards, becoming only the third film in history - after 1934's It Happened One Night and 1975's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest - to win all five major categories (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and Screenplay), and the first horror movie to win Best Picture. This is a tremendous achievement when it was released more than 12 months before, considering the Academy's notoriously short attention span. Each award was well deserved, with Best Director Jonathan Demme both marvellously pulling off the most gripping scenes and never losing sight of the human element of the picture, Best Actor Anthony Hopkins and Best Actress Jodie Foster both delivering unforgettable performances as the dangerously intelligent cannibal serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter and the less-than-perfect but strong willed rookie FBI Agent Clarice Starling, and Ted Tally's Best Adapted Screenplay both delivering snappy, quotable dialogue (""Oh, and Senator, one more thing: LOVE your suit!"") and perfectly tapping into the mind of a serial killer.This is the horror film that they all want to be, but almost all of them won't. I've only ever seen one other that is in quite the same league as this, and that is The Sixth Sense (M. Night Shyamalan must have watched TSOTL about 12 times while making that film). This groundbreaking masterpiece of horror is the standard by which all other horror movies are measured, and it is indeed the film that for which Hopkins, Foster and Demme will all be remembered. 10/10."
"**** out of ****Awesome would say it all. This movie is brilliant as it shows two actors in great performances like Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster. But these two have become so overrated, that we even, sometimes, may forget the others from the great cast, like Ted Levine, Anthony Heald and Brooke Smith, all of them in great performances. I tried to watch this movie for the second time without anything nearby disturbing me like sounds, phone conversations and lights turning on and off. Glad I am as those things didn't happen the first time I watched it, so I could absorb the movie quite well. In conditions like that, I became completely frozen when I saw Hannibal Lecter for the first time, on screen, standing up, still, in that green prisoner outfit, in his prison cell, saying only ""Good Morning"".Well, Hopkins has proved himself he can deliver quite a good performance, whether he stands still or not, whether he's silence of not. The movie features many brilliant scenes like Lecter's escape from his cell in the police department, his conversations with Agent Clarice Starling and the breathtaking few scenes of Catherine Martin screaming for being held hostage by the never ending sinister psychopath, Buffalo Bill, played by Levine.The Silence Of The Lambs' plot is one many people might already know. But this review, of course, like all my others, are intended to be read by people who have already watched the movie. Foster goes on an assignment to meet Hannibal Lecter and take from him clues in order to catch the assassin. But Lecter gives Starling the chance for them to perform the ""quid pro quo"", which suggests that whenever he gives her information, she will have to tell him about her life. This makes character developing take place in most of the entire movie.This won 5 Oscars, as I think it deserved. The only thing I didn't like in it was when Foster withdrew her pistol in order to arrest Buffalo Bill, as she did it very slow, a minus for a winning performance like Foster's. But that's the only bad thing about this movie. What counts is the presence of professional people like Foster, Hopkins, Smith, Levine, and of course, the director Jonathan Demme."
"I found this film extremely scary and haunting, even though the actual violence wasn't overpowering by today's standards. In some ways, the suspense and the build-up to scenes is quite ""old school"" and proves that this approach still works. There are has been a lot of analysis why this film is so powerful. One talks about how Hannibal Lecter only appears for a very brief time in the movie, yet others talk about him and build him up, how some of the set pieces refer to our deep psychological fears...in the end, it works well, and I would highly recommend it. I have read critics who say that the killer Clarice is pursuing is too stereotypical, or simplistic. I would beg to differ: I find that that character too is quite scary, though doesn't have the three-dimensional nature of Hannibal Lecter. And what of Clarice? she is brave, and even though it was made in the 90s, I think this film is still one of the first I saw with a woman as lead detective. Full marks to the script, and the book of course, because Clarice is quite fallible, not perfect, and this makes the story more real and unsettling. We're fighting in her corner, as it were, but we're not sure if she will win, unlike other male-dominated movies. And one personal quirk: watch out for Tom Petty's song, ""American Girl"", I found the usage interesting, fun and ironic, and the song has stuck in my head post the movie."
"This movie is excellent. It is one of my favorites. My future career is going to be working as a C.S.I., and Criminalist and Parole Board member. This movie has a lot things in it that are related to these things.The actors and actresses did a great job in this film, as did the filmmakers and other crew members. I hate those two physcopath Dr. Hannibal Lecter and Jame Gumb, a.k.a. Buffalo Bill who skins his victims. These victims are young women who are a size 14. He also is a resemblance of Ted Bundy. That is he spots a woman ans puts his arm in a cast pretending he's injured and needs help. When they help him he attacks. Great Movie!"
"This film is shown almost on a daily basis on TV and I never had the chance to finally see the ending of this picture. Jodie Foster,(Clarice Starling),""Sommersby"",'93, was an FBI Agent who had great insight into a killer's mind and also had some very dark secrets about Lambs which seemed to drive her crazy. Clarice had a difficult assignment from the FBI to look into the brain of Anthony Hopkins,(Dr. Hannibal Lecter),""The Human Stain"",'03, who was a mental patient and had some very valuable information the FBI needed in order to capture a horrible killer. The acting by Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins were outstanding in making this a 'Thrill-A- Diller' of a film story."
"Classic Psycho Drama which attacks the senses and plays mind games with whomever watches it ! Anthony Hopkins(Hannibal Lechter) gives a Tour De Force performance as the ultimate misguided Psychiatrist from Hell, whose ambitions vary from moment to psychotic moment. Lechter known for his exceptional perception,is visited by Clarice Starling (Jodi Foster)a new recruit for the F.B.I., that needs to get Hannibal's insight. Even though Hannibal is incarcerated for most of the movie, you feel that he is in total control. Hannibal gives Clarice clues thru the movie, to solve the ""Buffalo Bill"" case, and to help her advance her career and deal with her psychological problems. In effect he becomes her psychiatrist behind bars, interesting. Watch for their third meeting, where Hannibal's head seems to be floating on the reflective glass, really creepy ! Everyone in the movie , from her boss, Scott Glenn(Jack Crawford) to Jame Gumb(Buffalo Bill), is either seeking advancement or control of their own reality, amazing !!!As Clarice gets closer to solving the case, Hannibal escapes, and then things really get out of control !!!Terrific ending in the home of ""Buffalo Bill"" will leave you on the edge of your seat !!! Great Directing by Jonathan Demme and OUTSTANDING Editing by Craig McCay, take you into the world of Starling and Lechter, but will not let you totally escape from their presence, not a safe movie !!! There are a few flaws, as to how Lechter gets the pen, or how he knows where to phone Clarice, but they are minor.Ted Levine should have gotten Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, this role could have typecast his career.This movie should be viewed by Adults ONLY !!! I highly recommend ""Silence of the Lambs"", Winner of the TOP 5 Academy Awards, only 3rd movie in history to do so !!!"
"The Silence of the Lambs is one of the most frightening yet intense and intelligent films from the early nineties. The casting of Sir Anthony Hopkins as the evil Dr. Hannibal Lector was a perfect choice and he won an Academy Award for his 16 minutes of airtime. Jodie Foster deserved her second Academy Award for Best Leading Actress in this film. Jodie's Clarice Starling is perhaps one of the best female heroine roles of all time. I enjoyed watching this film again on AMC with tidbits of information on the bottom of the screen about the film-making. I would have like to have seen more Diane Baker on screen. I would have like to have known more about Dr. Lector's past too. The film always packs a punch when you least expect it at the end of the film. Besides great acting, directing, and writing, there is something unforgettable about this film. You walk away wondering about why this happens and about the monsters inside of them."
"The film that began the world famous Hannibal Lector character is a very good one indeed. But I don't think that it lives up to the full quantity of its hype. The two leads deserved the Oscars they won back in 1991 but I don't think that the film deserved any more than that.
Nonetheless, the quality of acting from these two leads is outstanding. At 28 she was already an accomplished actress so Jodie Foster perfectly captures the role of hesitantly determined detective Clarice Starling. It's hard to believe that the Hannibal Lector part was offered to so many other actors before Anthony Hopkins was rightfully offered the role. He creates one of the most memorable movie characters of the 20th Century and is brilliant for the part. It's a shame that the same can't be said about the rest of the performances. Ted Levine, one of the most overlooked actors in the past 20 years, never receives any conviction in his role, offers us no motive, and is just plain dull in his part. No background is offered to his character and is much inferior to Ralph Fiennes character in the recently made prequel, `Red Dragon'. Scott Glenn soon gave up `the method' after he proved to be a dud. Apparently, he sat in a room for hours everyday listening to the sounds of killers torturing their victims, so he could prepare for the role. Too bad that what we see on screen is something less professional.
One thing that the film does succeed in doing is intensifying scenes so as you don't know what will happen next. It gets gratuitously visceral in some scenes to try and be humane, but just looks gruesome and unattractive. While the story is complex and the film ends so as most people will be satisfied, I didn't see much else of `sheer brilliance' about it.
Maybe it's just me or maybe this is a needlessly overrated film. But still, `The Silence of the Lambs' is a very good horror/thriller that well outshines its disastrous sequel `Hannibal'. 7.5/10."
