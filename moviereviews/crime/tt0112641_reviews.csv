Reviews
"A complex, multilayered, beautifully directed film, Martin Scorsese's Casino is a masterpiece of destruction and betrayal. Few films take so many chances and succeed so wonderfully. It takes some of the basic formulas that were found in Goodfellas and applies them to another type of story - while Goodfellas' view was ground-level, telling the story of the ""blue collar"" gangsters of NYC, this film tells the story of the guys who controlled those guys. And it's fascinating to watch these people run Las Vegas, control the flow of money, and then fall from the heights of power due to lust, hubris, and greed. An amazing film that will hopefully get the recognition it deserves in the years to come."
"If you haven't seen Casino yet, stop whatever it is you're doing, rush to the nearest video store, rent it, and watch it.  Along with Mean Streets Casino is probably Scorsese's most underrated and unheralded picture.  I would also venture to say that this is probably his most ambitious film. The film deals with a particular time period and a particular atmosphere and accomplishes an overwhelming achievement by creating and accurately portraying both.  The art direction is splendid, most likely the best of any film Scorsese has ever done.  The acting is superb.  I never thought Pesci would be able to top his dynamic performance in Raging Bull until I saw Casino.  Every time I watch this picture I fall in love with it all over again.  This is the most honest depiction of Las Vegas, especially of the time period it was portrayed in.  Scorsese's direction is flawless. Perhaps it is because I watch alot of Scorsese and Kubrick films, but I am becoming less satisfied with plot driven films and more enamored by films that possess the freedom that typical stories just don't seem to hold.  Sharon Stone gives the best performance of her career, and as far as the editing is concerned, well if you believe like Kubrick and Pudovkin that a film is not shot, but built who better to have on your team than long time cohort, collaborator, and editor Thelma Schoonmaker.  Ultimately, the genius of Scorsese is not just in the mastery of the medium, but in the understanding and appreciation for the necessity of great collaborators on all levels that Scorsese has consistently utilized throughout his career.  Casino exemplifies not only the best of a Scorsese film, but transcends it.  This film is truly a gem."
"This is one of the best films of the 90's hands down. Without a doubt this has become one of my favorite movies. I'm not sure why really, I just love it. I think because I read the book and a lot of what happened in real life happened in my little town in Chicago. No names, and my old boss who runs our town grocery store actually knew ""Ace"". Again, no names. That was always pretty cool to me, since my town really didn't have much excitement. I guess also because I'm a huge fan of Martin, Robert, and Joe's. When they work together, they create masterpieces. I've read a lot of comments on IMDb, and more than 50% of the comments are calling this ""Goodfells Part 2"". Is it ""Goodfellas Part 2"", in my opinion, no. Yes, it's very similar situations, but it's not the same plot. It's a little more gory and more bright. ""Casino"" is mainly about the rise and fall of Las Vegas. When Robert DeNiro's character says ""It's more like Disney Land now"". Actually that's true, it's not like it used to be. I'm only 20, but my mom and dad told me how different the times were in the 60's and 70's. Everyone was more close and wanted to know who you were and how everything was going. Everything is more corporate greed now-a-days. But back onto the movie, it does have gangsta's in it, and with that comes some pretty gruesome violence.Robert DeNiro. No words can describe how wonderful of an actor he is. If you read in most of my comments, you can tell I'm a fan. This movie is actually what made me into a huge fan of his. He's dialog and image is very powerful and you understand his position. You want to love him, even though technically he's a bad guy too, you still think he is so cool. A lot of people I talked too: the guys wanted to be him and the girls wanted to be with him. What a performance, it deserved more praise.Joe does it again being the A$$hole who thinks with his gun and not with his head. Joe as an actor is very remarkable. He's only 5' 6'', but he is so intimidating. His speech in the desert with Ace and the big confrontation. ""You want me to get out of my own town?! Don't *bleep* with me, Ace!"" Does he swear in this movie? Oh, yeah. A lot, we're talking 400+ f-words, guys. But you get past the vulgar language and just enjoy what Joe says and does. The head vice scene and the metal bat scene with Joe is two of the most disturbing scenes in cinematic history.Sharon Stone, what can I say? What a remarkable performance! She was very much robbed of her deserved Oscar. I was reading in my ""Rober DeNiro: A history of his films"" that Sharon over shined both Joe's and Robert's performance. In some ways that is very true. She plays a gold-digging, druggie, drunk, hustling, whore. She is very glamorous in the film though, she is covered in beautiful gowns and jewelery that no guy could ever resist. Her first scene where Robert first sees her and she is stealing chips from a guy who has ""hired"" her for a night was extremely effective. You can see why Ace fell so hard for her. What a terrific performance in the end. When she screams at Ace ""I will go to the FBI! I will go to the police! I'm not protecting you anymore!"", you get scarred and can't help but watch more even though you are sitting on your butt for more than 2 1/2 hours. You hate her character so much, you want her to get what's coming to her, that's what makes a terrific performance. When you actually want to make sure that this character gets the justice he or she deserves. Sharon, I apologize, you deserved more praise as well.Martin Scorcesse. One of the greatest living directors of our time. This film was very wonderfully made with great visuals. The soundtrack really adds a lot, I'm telling you, and the theatrical trailer with the song ""Gimme Shelter"" by the Rolling Stones, what a great feel. Martin has been nominated several times for an Oscar, but they snub him. I think because his films are so violent and typical. But they remain classics. I'm disappointed with the Oscars, this man deserves more. Whew. ""Casino"" is an excellent movie that I highly recommend for mob movie lovers. Don't compare this to ""Goodfellas"", let it stand on it's own. But please, this is not a movie for children in any manor. For the parents, this is a movie that should be on the wait until the later teens. It's very violent, we're talking a head in a vice, a beating with a metal bat(just to name a few violent scenes, there's more)drugs, sex, and very vulgar language. This is for adults only!It's a great movie that deserves very much to be on the top 250. I'd like to see it in the top 100, but we'll see. 10/10"
"Based on a true story, Martin Scorsese ""Casino"" is a motion picture about two characters and their chance to rule the desert paradise of Las Vegas We are introduced in with all the lights, the noise, the flashing and the colors of the town that doesn't sleep day or night De Niro's character, Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, is based on Frank ""Lefty"" Rosenthal, who was a hell of a handicapper He was so good that whenever he bets, he could change the odds for every bookmaker in the country Genius at what he was doing with numbers, he proved to a lot of guys in the Chicago Mob that he was a tremendous earner that he could make a lot of money for them As a result, he was able to accomplish whatever bookmaking, handicapping, he wanted to do, with the umbrella of protection from those guys 'Ace' runs the casino with an iron fist refusing any outside people cheating at his tablesBut he had a fatal flaw 'Ace' always felt that he could logically and intelligently deal with things, even to deal with emotions So he decides on making a life with a woman who, he knows, does not necessarily love him Anyway with such a sexy wife and money to burn, 'Ace' was the epitome of opulence, confidence and power Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) was fascinating Great woman, truly beautiful, one of the best-known hustlers in town For her, a guy like 'Ace' was the ultimate score So the way to Ginger's heart was clearly money 'Ace' knew that but he didn't careWhat he wanted was to marry her Sharon Stone really stood up to the challenge in her role as a casino hustler who is so wild She was young, fresh, confident, looking absolutely fantastic as the independent woman whom everybody desiresJoe Pesci succeeds in his scary tough role as the strong man who has nerve, and isn't afraid of the cops He was reportedly a mob hit man reputed to be a sadistic killer (In one scene, his character is shown torturing someone by putting his head in a vise.) To protect his friend and adviser, Nicky (Pesci) would beat to a pulp any street guys who messed with 'Ace' or didn't give him the proper respect Over the course of their friendship Nicky delivered a number of these messages always making sure that 'Ace' didn't get his hands dirty 'Ace' witnessed several beatings on his behalf Nicky's mission was to show his worth to the family as an enforcerThe clothes on De Niro looked very straight, more dangerous and very threatening They were very important cues to his character, and again, to the progression of the story 'Ace' was an extremely fastidious guy And, of course, as you follow the story he starts out in more conservative colors and as things become more chaotic, the colors become more chaotic"
"As a lifelong gambler who has crossed paths with a few fringe types portrayed in the film, I'm well aware of the story, the culture, and the ambiance of the Tangiers, the fictional casino placed in the control of Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein (Robert Deniro). Rothstein is not a mob member, but a ""moneymaker"" for them because he's the nation's best sports handicapper. It was refreshing for a movie to finally show that not all gamblers are stupid, but instead one of those who takes advantage of the many who are.Rothstein's partner in crime is Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), who is far less convincing as a mobster than he would seem to like to believe. Sharon Stone plays the psychotic Ginger, a once-in-a-lifetime role in that it was the only time in my life I could bear to watch her on film. The supporting cast is strong, led by James Woods and Don Rickles (excellent in his dramatic capacity), and the movie is generally well-acted.If you are a gambler or know the ""wiseguy"" culture, the movie doesn't have to be explained, while if you aren't, you'll feel like you've stumbled upon the secret meeting place of the mafia and made privy to what is said, without anyone knowing you were there. This film is based on the true story of what happened when the mob tried to put its men in suits and have them heading a casino, and why it has never been tried since. The homage paid to the incestuous nature of Nevada politics was an excellent touch.Most of us wouldn't like a guy like Sam Rothstein, nor would we like to be him, but if we go to Vegas for a weekend and stay at a casino/hotel, we'll have a better experience if his watchful eye is ensuring that our stay is a pleasant one. The film's nod to how Vegas has been sanitized since those days is also accurate, and reflects sadness at a lost era, where the baby (the ""old school"" types who made Vegas great) was thrown out with the bathwater (the organized crime influences)."
"I have to admit my bias, because I believe that Scorcese cannot do wrong - ever.  Even his lesser-known or critically panned films are above the ""great film"" line, and Casino is certainly no exception. Casino spans three decades and chronicles the true story of a faction of the mob who ran Las Vegas casinos.  Robert DeNiro plays Ace Rothstein, a fantastic bookie who is chosen to run the Tangiers hotel and casino.  Along the way, he marries a drug-addicted con-artist trophy wife (Sharon Stone) and struggles with his friendship with loose-cannon Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci).  Rothstein is a complicated figure in that he is not a heavy, yet he wields a lot of power due to the respect he has gained from his mob bosses back home.  Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci are both fantastic in their roles, and Sharon Stone actually turned out a non-irritating performance.  As the viewer, you can't stand her, but that is the point.  Scorcese's normal supporting cast are also involved in this film, including his great mother - even though she usually has incredibly minimal roles, they are always memorable.
Scorcese seems to have several different directing styles, and Casino follows in the tradition of Goodfellas as a pseudo-documentary.  A lot of the exposition is revealed by the characters themselves in the form of voice-overs, and several scenes are filmed in documentarian fashion.  The entire production however, is sleek and very quick.  The use of music bears mentioning as well: Most Martin Scorcese films have an amazing soundtrack that adds to and enhances the scene.  Being a child of the MTV age, I'm a sucker for good uses of music in films and Scorcese is a master.  Scorcese doesn't just utilize the soundtrack, he makes it part of the storytelling - by the music, we chronologically know what time period we are witnessing, since one cannot rely on other factors, such as fashion alone.  One of my favorite scenes in film which effectively involves music is actually from Casino - the very intense scene when the relationship between DeNiro, Stone and Pesci come to a head in the climax of the film. The pounding music cut throughout this scene is a cover of ""Satisfaction"" by Devo and the result is absolutely brilliant.  Being a complete film geek, I generally don't go to films that feature certain stars, I go to films by certain directors and Scorcese is one of them.  While this was probably the tenth time I'd seen this film there were more things I noticed, and I'm sure I'll notice more upon my eleventh viewing.  The man is a complete genius, and a gift to film - my suggestion is to watch some of his films, then check out his unbelievable series, ""A Personal Journey with Martin Scorcese Through American Movies"" which was done the same year as Casino.  The series is essentially a primer on the history of film, sectioned off by film genres.  You not only will experience his amazing intellect and massive knowledge of film history, but his incredible humility as well.--Shelly"
"I saw Goodfellas first and more times than Casino. Yet, I totally love Casino as it is one of the best movies I have literally ever seen. I find Goodfellas to be overrated and Casino to be the movie that learned from the former's flaws.Something I really do think (more than my own opinion) is that if this was released before Goodfellas, this would be more liked. No new ground was broken, everything was just elevated.Robert De Niro gives his most underrated performance--as well as the second best of the year (behind Nicolas Cage in Leaving Las Vegas)-- as Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein. Ace is an unbeatable gambler who secures the mob's casino shenanigans while his lifelong best friend, Nicky Santoro (Pesci) keeps everybody in line. The only real difference between Nicky and Tommy from Goodfellas is Tommy has curlier hair. There's divided opinion on who is crazier/more violent. I lean towards Nicky. Ace helps the casino grow and eventually seizes full power by becoming the owner. Nicky's wild and crazy antics get him banned from every Las Vegas casino, so he decides to create his own. Meanwhile, Ace blindly falls for a beautiful prostitute named Ginger (Stone) and they get married. Her habits don't change and Ace does all he can to help her out. The love story in this is amazing. Ginger is unlikeable but we can't turn away from her. Her and Nicky both contribute to Ace's fall as well as the rise of other casinos in Vegas.One easy thing I loved was the performance by Robert De Niro. He is very likable and my heart breaks every time he is screwed over by Ginger and Nicky. He was easily a better lead than Ray Liotta and his character was more likable and deeper than Jimmy. In fact, all three of our leads in this are much deeper developed than the leads in Goodfellas. Ray Liotta is a dummy who is not cut out to be a mobster, while we see the conviction in Ace as he tries to make everything work out. Casino is also much more flashy and nicer too look at than Goodfellas which takes place in New York. The music in this is not distracting or overpowering. The filming is a step up. the flow is much better. And the story is superior. This has more of a linear and stable story than Goodfellas, which is just a man's escapades in the mafia. Everybody that watches Casino is impacted more than Goodfellas. To watch Casino, you have to be in a mood and well prepared. A movie has really done its job if it does that to a viewer, and actually has a purpose for its content.4/4"
"Casino is by far my favourite film. I enjoyed good fellas, thought Raging Bull was great and enjoyed Taxi driver but this is a cut above the rest imoI have seen this film to many times to count and i am yet to become even remotely sick of it. The acting is flawless, story flows at a great pace for the full all but 3 hours, great narration and a great soundtrackPesci and De Niro play their parts so well as does Stone. When watching this film I started to wonder what PEsci is really like in real life. Is he a crazed man like he so often plays? After seeing Casino you are likely to wonder, he is that goodI also think the characters in Casino are far more believable then those in good fellas.Must see for any gangster film fan"
"What a fantastic movie, thanks to its cast, top heavy with stars and fine direction of the ""Oscar begging"" Martin Scorsese. Robert de Niro and Joe Pesci are great, as always, together. But, surprisingly, it's Sharon Stone that comes of with all the acting credit, she simply effervesces as the gold digging casino hustler. After witnessing her performance myself I couldn't agree more, and think she deserves a place above Susan Sarandon who ""stole"" the Academy Award from under Sharon's nose.  The photography is phenomenal and combined with great acting is a recipe for a classy film.  However occasional brilliant sequences, are often marred by the continuous commentary, which prevents any real, deep, emotional involvement with any of the characters.  Great stuff, just slightly flawed.9/10."
Casino has to be one of the most underrated films that Martin Scorsese directed in the nineties. The acting by the leads is good and the script is excellent. Robert Deniro gave an Oscar worthy performance and Joes Pesci is chilling yet funny again. Even Sharon Stone is good in this brilliant film
"Martin Scorcese's harsh and yet delicately balanced masterpiece rises above anything petty meaning that if one wishes and has the ability and means to create a Sicilian mafia movie he should do so with grandeur and put into it as much effort as possible for people remember those who take advantage of their talent and circumstances and are diligent in their undertakings. Casino is in my opinion an epic, but it's much more than that. This film speaks even to those who dislike the subject of organized crime. You have to be objective when judging this movie and those of us who criticize everything that stands out amongst the grey background of that which is mediocre are fools who envy others' accomplishments and view them as insults to their own personal uselessness. Casino is one of the best movies of the 90's. In fact, in my opinion, it's one of the best organized crime movies of all time. Its moral is that no matter how tough you think you are there's always someone you answer to and that you ultimately will, indeed, if you screw things up."
"Casino is a very good film. If you're at all interested in gangster/mafia films, or if you're at all a fan of director/co-writer Martin Scorsese, novelist/co-writer Nicholas Pileggi, or actors Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone or James Woods, then Casino is without a doubt a must-see. I'm a huge De Niro fan, and I'm a fan of Scorsese and Woods as well. I certainly enjoyed the film.But I don't think that Casino is at all a ""perfect"" film. An 8 out of 10 may seem high, but if you're familiar with my reviews, you'll know that it's not that high of a score from me--it's closer to average from me. There are plenty of flaws here, and I'm going to spend some time pointing them out, particularly since the film receives so many 10's.Casino is based on the story of Frank ""Lefty"" Rosenthal and the Stardust casino in Las Vegas. The Rosenthal character is here named Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein and is played by De Niro. The hotel became the Tangiers for the film. The mob backs Rothstein but has to set up a false front while Rothstein ""secretly"" runs the hotel, because of his gambling charges back East. He falls in love with and marries former hooker/call-girl and current Vegas hustler Ginger McKenna (Stone), who remains in love with her pimp, Lester Diamond (Woods). Meanwhile, mob strong-arm Nicky Santoro (Pesci) heads out to Vegas to protect Rothstein, but eventually ends up running his own rackets and trying to effectively take over the town. Casino is the story of the relationship and political problems that this cast of characters and a number of associates run into. It's roughly a gradual road to destruction for everyone involved.The film is unusual in many ways. The most prominent oddity is that a large chunk of it is told via alternated narration from the two main characters, Rothstein and Santoro. The aim was probably to include a lot more of Pileggi's book, in a more literal way, than would have been possible through more conventional means. It's remarkable that the narration works as well as it does, especially because a lot of it is given a rapid-fire delivery. For at least the first 15 minutes, there is barely a pause in the narrational dialogue.One of the reasons it works is because of the style that Scorsese uses to accompany it in the opening. He employs a lot of fast cuts while presenting very stylized, documentary-like footage. The opening feels as much like an entertaining behind-the-scenes look at how the typical casino works as it feels like a fictional film about gangsters.Eventually, the film evolves from almost 100% narration to almost no narration (although the narration never completely leaves the film). This happens so subtly that one hardly notices. Scorsese's directorial style likewise evolves from the fast-cut documentary approach to something more conventional.This is all well and good, but on the other hand, the gradual evolution can only happen because the film is so long--it clocks in just a couple minutes shy of 3 hours. That's a bit too long for the story being told. By at least the halfway point, it starts to feel a bit draggy. All the material is necessary to the story, but it could have been tightened up a lot more.Another unusual aspect is the score/soundtrack, which consists primarily of pop hits from a wide time span--30 years or more. While I like the songs--I've owned the CD since it came out and I listen to it often enough--and the songs can help set the mood for some scenes, they become a bit too incessant and overbearing for the story after awhile. It begins to approach the dreaded ""mix tape"" mentality, where the songs are just there because the director wanted to share some bitchin' tunes that he likes a lot. A bit of ebb and flow with the music, and music better correlated to the drama, would have worked even better.Presumably, Scorsese was shooting for something like a sensory assault, since that's what you get in Vegas. The visuals are filled with neon lights, flashy clothes (I love Rothstein's suits), flashy people and such. The soundtrack is probably meant to match. But in that case, if I were directing, I think I would have went for a combination of commissioned music that incorporated a lot of casino sounds, or that mimicked a lot of casino sounds--the cacophonous electronic symphony of various machines constantly going through their modes--with schmaltzy show tunes, ala Liza, Jerry Vale, Tom Jones, Wayne Newton, etc.That Scorsese was trying to give a Vegas-styled sensory assault is also supported by the audio-visual contrast between the Vegas scenes and the scenes in other locations, such as Kansas City. So I can understand the motivation, but I'm not sure the final result exactly worked.Of course the performances are exceptional, even if everyone is playing to type, except for maybe Woods. The plot and characters are written and performed so that the viewer can see the disasters coming way before the characters can--and that's how it should be. For example, as a viewer, you know as soon as it starts that it's a bad idea for Rothstein to kowtow to McKenna to win her hand in marriage, but Rothstein is blind in love and he ends up paying for it. Everything unfolds almost a bit predictably in this respect, and another slight flaw is that we're shown the penultimate moment of the film right at the very beginning. It tends to make it feel even more stretched out, as you keep anticipating that scene.But the slight flaws shouldn't stop anyone from seeing this film, and of course, quite a few viewers feel that there are no flaws at all."
"Martin Scorsese's Casino has all the ingredients for a great crime film. It's got hits, bad language, Robert DeNiro, gambling, lots of Italian Americans - it's all there. Furthermore, it's got a great soundtrack, the Las Vegas setting makes for a great location and the acting is largely very good...but somehow, this just isn't a great film. Scorsese has missed the mark thanks to a lack of emotion. There is no reason to care for the characters in this movie, and that makes the film hard to connect with on the whole. The movie also follows the common Scorsese format, in that some guy gets rich and respected, then something bad happens and he finds himself back where he started. In fact, the ending of this movie is only an ""I'm a schmo"" away from being a complete copy of Goodfellas. Still, at least the movie manages to stay interesting for most of it's runtime, and it's easy to forgive the flaws when you're watching Joe Pesci threatening someone who's head he's jammed into a vice.Casino lasts almost three hours, and it's fair to say therefore that this movie is overlong. It's not so bad for the first two hours, but once the film enters the final third; cracks begin to appear and the film isn't as interesting as it was, not much unlike Goodfellas; which also suffered from a trite final third. Tarantino's influence on cinema is felt in this movie, and that is obvious from the way that Scorsese has seen fit to saturate the movie in 'cool' old classics. Still, some of these songs; such as Fleetwood Mac's ""Go Your Own Way"" and The Animals' ""The House of the Rising Sun"" are really good songs and actually bode well with the action on screen. For this movie, Martin Scorsese has re-recruited the excellent pairing of Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci, and both give their trademark excellent performances in this film. Casino may well be DeNiro's last great performance before he went on his downward spiral, which started with the fellow 1995 movie ""Heat"". On the whole, while this film is technically sound, it lacks emotional bite and there will be times during the film when your interest will trail off. It's an entertaining ride, but it's one that is ultimately shallow."
"Scorsese, De Niro and Pesci team up again for a amazing movie with unforgettable performances.The film portrays Las Vegas at a time when it was dominated by the mafia, extremely well directed by Scorsese that film shows Robert De Niro as manager of the Tangiers Casino who have to deal with his unstable wife that used to be a high-class prostitute but who can not forget her pimp Lester and with his childhood friend Nicky that is taking the city with extreme uncontrolled violence bringing a bad image to the plans that the mafia has in Las Vegas.Sharon Stone definitely give the best performance of her career in this film and the secondary characters convey very well the image of the great leaders of the mafia.Casino is a classic and a must-see movie."
"...or is this the darkest black comedy ever made? I just find Casino so amusing and funny that I hardly even notice the grim violence and harrowing drama. I also think that Casino is far, far superior to the over-rated Goodfellas. Even though it's longer, it passes in a breeze. Casino is just so colorful, multi-layered and intricate despite it's apparent simplicity. The film has three different characters narrating the story but none of it feels like exposition and it's never over-bearing.Adapted from a true story, the film focuses on the fictional Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas. The boss is Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, his wife, volatile hustler Ginger and his psychotic 'friend' Nicky Santoro. All they needed to do was to keep the cash-flow at the Casino steady to satisfy the bosses back home. But it was just never meant to be. And everything implodes at the end.Casino is filled with dozens of sub-plots, tangent stories and brilliant side-characters. James Woods is especially funny as a lowlife con-man who can't even win a fight with a ten-year-old girl. Vinny Vella also amuses as long-suffering Artie Piscano. But it's Sharon Stone who walks away with the movie. Despite starring opposite loads of well-established male lead actors she owns Casino. She was absolutely robbed at the Academy Awards when they gave the Oscar to Susan Sarandon. Stone delivered a performance so authentic that it's truly unfair the amount of criticism she gets for her other, less-important films.The violence will satisfy gore fans. In this lovely film we have a dope with his head in a vice (after getting icepicks in his balls), a truly brutal beating with baseball bats, some moron getting a pen shoved into his neck and a cheater getting his hand mashed by a hammer. Don't let this put you off, that was the old Vegas. Nowadays you just get told not to come back.I know most people will call it sacrilege to condemn Goodfellas but Casino is just the better film of the two, plain and simple. Better lighting, far more impressive cinematography and more entertaining characters. It just has so much going for it that Goodfellas did not."
"Martin Scorsese strikes again with this raunchy classic about the Italian mob taking over the city of Las Vegas. De Niro excels as he plays 'Ace' Rothstein, a classy business man, who throughout the movie gains success and popularity which soon leads to his downfall. Pesci plays tough guy Nicky Santoro, who has more of an old fashion way of solving problems, but none the less, gains power and succeeds throughout this film. Sharon Stone was a flawless gem in this film. Sharon stole every scene if it was with her laughing, crying, sobbing or living it up. Casino is the most enjoyable film on the 90's, a must-see classic."
"This movie is entertaining, for sure, but just one attentive glance at the editing and you know Scorcese's struggling to make it work.  The voice-overs simply function to move the plot in places where the filmed action can't take it.  A film relying on voice-over for exposition is usually missing some pieces.  Plus as a movie about how relationships can dissolve there really isn't much to work from.  The Rothstein/Ginger connection is totally breezed over and you get no real sense of their relationship, other than ""he's controlling"" and ""she's nuts.""  Plus Joe Pesci is simply reprising his role from Goodfellas.  In fact it seems the entire movie is just a Goodfellas retread, but without the great pacing and script that kept that classic together.  Just because Martin Scorcese directed it, doesn't mean it's good!"
"One of the gravest sins of cinema is spending too long on exposition. For this reason film makers are given adages like: Show not tell, cut to the chase and so on. This lesson seems lost on Mr Scorcese.This films consists of nothing but expository narration through out the entire length of the film. I simply could not believe it at first. I felt sure that the two narrators, De Niro and Pesci, would stop talking at some point and the acting would start. This point never comes and you realise that this is what the movie will be: nonstop narration telling you what to think about a character, what the characters think, what's happening and what's about to happen.It is unbelievable that someone would set out to make a movie this way.In addition there is a constant 'commentary' of old songs through out. Some of this yet more underlining of the banal obviousness of a scene, such as when we see De Niro looking at Sharon Stone intently, the previous music is suddenly interrupted with ""baby baby you're the one"" and, just in case we haven't got it, we told in the narration that he has fallen in love. Is this film making for the under 5s? At other times however it seems that Scorcese is simply using the score as his personal jukebox and playing favourites from his own record collection. All of this limits what little character development there is. The characters appear on screen, we are told who they are and what we should think about them and then move onto something else. A case in point is the romance between de Niro and Sharon Stone. He sees her and we are told (in narration) he is has fallen for her. Next we see them together and he asks her for change which she says she spent in the machines. We are again told in narration that this is untrue. So much for subtlety and acting eh? Then we next see them, we see De Niro proposing to her (after a voice-over telling us he was proposing to her naturally).Joe Pesci does his usual schtick of an Italian-American psychopath, so we see him engaging needless brutality from early on. De Niro is his usual commanding self but the non stop narrative actually diminishes him as an actor. The same applies to all the other characters.I could not make it to the end."
"Casino is so fast-paced and entertaining, it doesn't even feel like it's 3 hours at all. Fans of Scorsese, DeNiro, and Pesci will love this. They're all at their usual greatness, but the pleasant surprise from this movie is the electrifying performance by Sharon Stone (who won a Golden Globe award and got an Oscar nomination for her role). She's truly the crazy bitch you love to hate.It isn't all too original, it uses the same formulas as other Scorsese movies (particularly Goodfellas), but it just works. It's a fun movie. The camera moves as if it has a life of its own, almost every scene is set to great music, the dialogue and narration are top-notch, and everything is just perfect. What more could you possibly want?It's the closest thing to Goodfellas II, but it still stands on its own very well. Everyone should see this movie. It's 3 hours well spent.My rating: 10/10"
"Casino is my favorite movie of the last decade of the last century. Just like in Goodfellas, Martin Scorsese rivets the audience to their seats without a real hero to root for. It's the power of the characters he creates.Robert DeNiro as the gambler boss of the Tangiers casino in Las Vegas of the 70s and 80s and Joe Pesci gangster are long time boyhood pals from the mean streets of Brooklyn. Both move out to Las Vegas seeking their respective places in their related fields at the orders of the higher ups in the criminal world. But circumstance drives them apart and one of those circumstances is Sharon Stone.People descending into degradation is always a role that will get you noticed by the Academy. Sharon Stone's part as Ginger is no exception here. She's a high price call girl when we first meet her and her descent into drug addiction isn't pretty, but Scorsese keeps it very real.But the main story line involves DeNiro and Pesci. To see ourselves as others see us is one elusive goal not attained by many in this world. These two aren't an exception. Each can see how the other is screwing up and absolutely cannot see what he's doing.The key scene in the whole film is when DeNiro and Pesci meet in the desert where a lot of problems have been known to disappear. If you can get passed all the cursing which is how you would expect gangsters to talk, each is making very realistic assessments about the other one and neither is listening to a word the other is saying. This is why I love Casino so much. I've never seen that particular theme ever handled so well on the screen."
"""A lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes.""I learned three things from Casino: running a casino is a tough business, Las Vegas is a complicated town, and a terrible wife makes life much harder. Casino is a lengthy movie about the rise and fall of a couple of Vegas big-shots, and  the loss of the essence of old-school Vegas, itself. The story is told primarily from the points of view of Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein (Robert De Niero) and Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), two guys who have known each other for years, and come to make money in Vegas in very different ways.Sam is a genius at all aspects of gambling that's tapped by the mob bosses back east to run a casino for them, while Nicky is a muscle guy who's there to protect Sam's operation. We watch them make a lot of money, and get into a lot of trouble because of their respective weaknesses/excesses. It's an entertaining movie, and the 179 minute runtime will pass by pretty quickly.Both De Niro and Pesci were excellent, with many other great actors supporting their performances. A lot of your enjoyment of this movie will hinge on your preference for the genre. Casino is very much a mob-type movie, though it's not a Godfather Part II Las Vegas re-tread, by any means. If even someone like me who's not a particular fan of this kind of movie can enjoy it, then that's a promising sign that most others will enjoy it, too.        "
"Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci, two great actors, star in Martin Scorsese's underrated, and in my opinion, almost best, Casino. Casino is a very entertaining, very engaging, very well acted, very long,and very terrific film. DeNiro and Pesci play two mobster friends who's friendship dies when they go to Vegas and DeNiro becomes pit boss. Money and greed brings them up to the top. DeNiro gets married to Sharon Stone's character, who is kind of a criminal with a bad love past.I didn't give too much of the plot. Because a lot happens in the film's slow three hours.Magnolia,One of my favorite films, is three hours long. The Lord of the rings trilogy is three hours long. Schindler's list is three hours long. Titanic is three hours long. Those films are all three hours long. Those films are all fantastic. Casino is a fantastic film. But still, it's not quite as good as The Departed, which is my favorite Scorsese film. It probably comes in second place for me.Casino is a very engrossing,very well acted, very interesting, very long, and very great film. That is all I can say about it. I loved it. Despite it's length. That was the only problem I found with it.Casino:A+"
"Anyone seen Goodfellas? You know ... gangsters, violence, long story, Joe Pesci being a complete and utter maniac? Well, save your bucks. In a nutshell, CASINO is a total replica of a very good film. I'm not saying it's not good. It's just a replica.Sam Rothstein (De Niro) is the man; a gambling genius who (his Jewishness holding him back) becomes THE man in Las Vegas. The problem is that he isn't a made guy cosa-nostra-wise. Doh!! If only he had an Italian background, so many lives could have been spared. As it happens, the Vegas mob bosses insist on Mr. Pesci being there to 'take care' of business. In other words, sadistically maim any idiot who messes with our Sam's good business. Watch out particularly for the 'hammer from nowhere' and Joe's novel use of a Black and Decker workmate which will, guaranteed, bring water to the eyes.Much is made of Sharon Stone's tour de force in this movie as Ginger, Sam's moll. It's definitely a cut above her previous acting credits (who remembers Sliver? answers on a postcard) but at the end of the day, it comes down to her being given a decent script for once, and the chance to ham it up for all she's worth. If screaming and ranting on coke guarantees you plaudits, fair play. Worth a nomination? OK. The Oscar itself? Please.Scorsese is the best director around for this kind of film. You will come out of the cinema saying ""Wow"", ""Yipes"", ""Cool"" etc. Even after a good three hours. No arguments - it is hard hitting and scary. BUT Martin - it's been done before. By you. And with Goodfellas, it was so much more original and, basically, better. De Niro, Pesci and Liotta were seminal. Replace Liotta with Stone, and it's only semi-seminal.Casino will appeal to those who love a good shoot-up, blood and guts and plenty of actors yelling at each other. You will get value for your video rental, if that's what you're after.Let's face it - three hours! But if you want better value, hire out Goodfellas again."
"To the fans of Casino, I see the whole film as an allegory for the way the world is run. Think about it. A bunch of mediocre and incompetent Italian gangsters send their cleverest Jew to take over the gambling business in Las Vegas. He does a great job and makes them rich. But these moronic and aging Italian gangsters send one of their own (a violent and psychotic Italian enforcer) to watch over the Jew. The Jew is doing a good job but he gets carried away and marries a beautiful but materialistic and drug addicted woman under the false notion that he can change her ways. He also pisses off another ethnic group when he refuses to take back an incompetent employee. Meanwhile, the psychotic Italian systematically undoes all of the Jew's hard work. Things get messed up. So like I said earlier, I thought the film was an allegory for the way the world is run. There are some really incompetent and mediocre people at the top. The really clever guys are in middle management but even they get carried away. Ethnic groups are perpetually involved in power struggles. And in the end, the large corporations and the squares replace these guys. The film is almost like an ode to the old ways (however mad and violent they might have been) before the corporations took over everything. The film predicts Wolf of Wall Street in the way Scorsese's films would be made and edited. There are two narrators who talk us through the sensory assault filled with interesting camera angles, fast cuts, violence, beautiful women and the opulence of Las Vegas. Three hours simply ran by. De Niro and Pesci are ably supported by Don Rickles, Sharon Stone and James Woods. Best Regards, Pimpin. (10/10)"
"A reprise of Goodfellas, mostly, as has been pointed out, and although long, not as tired or boring as some have felt. How could a movie with Steve Allen and Jerry Vale be all bad? People have wondered why Scorcese and Coppola keep coming back to mobsters, specifically the Mafia, and all that corruption mixed with loyalty. Of course no one knows, perhaps not even the directors. But I suspect there are at least three reasons: First, it works economically. It draws the audience in. There is power and violence and sex to appeal to the men's fantasies. There is loyalty, intrigue, sheltered family lives, and the excitement of a wealthy rogue male for women. Second, Italian-Americans may return repeatedly to stories of the Mafia for the same reason that Southern writers deal over and over with themes of minority relations. In spelling out the stories, they are explaining the odd customs of their subcultures to the rest of us. Yes, we are hung up on these obsessions, just as you believe, and here is how things work -- a bit more subtle than you'd thought, aren't they? Finally, in exploring these themes in the interests of the outsider's better understanding of them, they can explore their own conflicts in model form, as stated in the anthropologist John M. Roberts' conflict-enculturation hypothesis. When we view something with ambivalence we tend to poke around in it, to touch it, fascinated by it. If we can't actually DO the thing itself -- become a mobster, endorse slavery -- we can play games with the idea, constructing little mock worlds in which we can jiggle the concepts around. In conflict about having children? Well -- you don't really need to. You can nurture something that is a model or surrogate child. Cats and dogs will do fine. But if your conflict is more intense, you are driven to less recognizable models. House plants, say. And if the conflict is VERY intense, you can start a coin or a stamp collection. What, after all, do you do with a stamp collection? You conceive of the idea, you start it when it's small, you feed it, you watch it grow and get bigger, and when it gets too big, or when you lost interest, you sell it on eBay and it moves out of the house. Directing a movie means constructing a model world too, like the model social world of a chess game.In a movie, you lay out a plot, cause the characters to do certain forbidden things, and imagine how you might feel if you were doing them yourself. I'm not surprised that Scorcese made this movie, or that he's filled it with Italian-American actors. I'm not surprised that Faulkner wrote Intruder in the Dust, or that Judith Rossner wrote Looking for Mr. Goodbar, or that Philip Roth wrote Portnoy's Complaint. These model worlds they've created deal with issues like crime, race, female sexuality, and ethnic loyalties that have kept Italian-Americans and Southerners and feminists and Jews marginal to the rest of our culture. The artists are trying to explain to us and to themselves how things look from the inside. If these issues ever disappear, which is most improbable, the conflicts will ease, marginal populations will no longer be prompted to produce such intense work, and the rest of us will be poorer for it.Maybe in this case Scorsese did too good a job of it. I found myself listening to DeNiro's voice-over telling us that the James Woods character was a ""scumbag"" because he was a small-time chiseler chasing dentists on the golf course, taking money from the whore Sharon Stone. But who is DeNiro's character to make such judgments? Woods is detestable because he's a vellicating minor hood with no money? Whereas DeNiro is morally superior because he's a major player with LOTS of illegal gains? We admire DeNiro because he is the more successful crook. The moral calculus is a little confusing. On top of all that highbrow stuff -- man, does Scorsese know how to stage a fierce family fight. I should know. And that opening scene -- a car explosion backed by the majestic sweep of Bach's Missa Solemnis!"
"During the first part, as we learn the ins and outs of a 1970s and '80s Las Vegas casino taking us so close to the mechanics of the operation we feel part of the roulette table or the dice rolling across... is intentionally created in the same fashion director Martin Scorsese showed us the mob's operation in GOODFELLAS.But then something happens, or stops happening, or both.The main character, Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein, played by Robert DeNiro, is a man of mind, not action. He's to gambling what Scorsese is to directing a natural and the casino itself becomes an absorbing character: we feel pulse of the tables and machines, and the men behind the scenes, keeping the moneymaking beast alive while protecting her from cheaters, con artists, and crooked politicians.Enter Joe Pesci as Nicky, Rothstein's childhood friend: the muscle who's cocky, dangerous, and ultimately undependable. And the flavor of the month, Sharon Stone, as Sam's trophy girlfriend turned wife, Ginger, who becomes the wormed apple of his eye – and soon, for a man who seemed infallible, nothing matters but trusting a woman who repeatedly warned him not to. The movie hits a wall with the escalating relationship between Sam and Ginger, but it was faltering beforehand – DeNiro, Pesci, and some of the other shady characters, although colorful and formidable, aren't very interesting nor are they people to care about – unlike GOODFELLAS, RAGING BULL, or TAXI DRIVER, they all seem more written than real.And the duel-narration, beautifully wielded in GOODFELLAS between Ray Liotta and Lorraine Bracco, works and it doesn't: DeNiro's metronomic account of the proceedings is fine in the beginning, giving us a firsthand account of how the casino runs from the inside, it becomes a rambling safety net for the lack of a streamlined plot: especially when his business luck turns sour. While Joe Pesci's counterpoint is completely unnecessary, sounding like a goon version of Bugs Bunny, filling us with details better left for the audience to figure on their own.And the last half runs itself completely ragged: juggling a doomed love story straight out of a nighttime soap with Ace and Nicky's doomed friendship that meanders to a predictably violent conclusion (and they never seemed that tight to begin with for an unraveling to really matter).If Scorsese and scriptwriter Nicholas Pillegi stuck closer to the Casino, perhaps the film, and characters, might have had more purpose. What we're left with is too much style without substance. So to pay homage to vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen's comment to Dan Quayle's comparison of Jack Kennedy: ""I saw Goodfellas. I know Goodfellas. You, Casino, are NO Goodfellas."" And (spoiler alert) has there ever been a character more deserving a bloody death than James Wood's pimp/hustler who not only repeatedly steals Stone from DeNiro, but kidnaps, and continually threatens, his daughter? While we witness the immense, overboard bloodshed of everyone else, James comes out with a few bruises. What the hell were they thinking?!For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com"
"A good gangster movie that might remind you of Goodfellas. I found the script, directing, and performances all top notch. The opening scene of the car blowing up will stay with you for a long time. The trials and tribulations of gangster/family life is explored in this movie. See it if you get the chance.*** out of ****"
I have a huge reverence for movies like this. I feel Scorsese is the only director alive who can do it. If you are a fan of the genre watch it!
Typical Joe Pesci and De Niro. Character development at its finest combines with Scorceses slow and detailed but attractive storylines. A must watch!
"The story feels very engaging. How Martin Scorcese tells it makes the audience leave the movie screening feeling enlightened. I really like how the movie used so many narrations as a supporting way to help the scenes build up. Add that with the clever and dramatic visuals using camera trickery, you get the astonishing look at the crime scenes. Particularly, the scene where the con artist gets his hand smashed is really neatly done.It's actually simple trick using camera angle and mock props, but the movie used it in a sudden way that is guaranteed to pull your eyes to the screen. The acting work is also great. Robert DeNiro nicely depicts the cooler mafia while Joe Pesci repeats himself as the great actor of the ruthless kind of the mafia. Sharon Stone did well in balancing both men."
"Many consider this film as a sub - GoodFellas (1990) rip off, due to the style of the film and the nature of the violence and dialogue. While I agree that there are certain similarities, it must be considered independent from Martin Scorsese's 1990 masterpiece. Indeed, Casino expands on GoodFellas and improves it.We are now forced to care about Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (Robert De Niro) and his downward spiral. In GoodFellas, we viewed the world of Henry Hill, but we were never really cared about him or his friends. Joe Pesci's performance as Nicky Santoro is, for me personally, far more disturbing than Tommy De Vito. Santoro is more vicious and is prepared to back stab Rothstein over business and his wife, Ginger (Sharon Stone, in an Oscar nominated role, and rightly so). Even the violence is considered more graphic. I know a few people who were distressed by the intensity of the violence and had to stop watching the film. This is, surely, a success on the part of Scorsese and his cast on the fact that they are able to get such gut reactions from people who have been raised on slasher films, such as Halloween (1978).There's also more of a story to Casino, which makes it a more engaging tale. No detail is too small for Rothstein, even down to the number of currents in a bun. It's a fascinating view about the rise and fall of the mob in Las Vegas, the playground of the world. The interesting thing about Rothstein is that he isn't actively involved in the violence, but he certainly doesn't condone it. Watch his face as the guy's hand is smashed with the hammer.My only complaint is that James Woods is pretty weak as Lester Diamond, Ginger's former pimp. Considering his performance as a gangster in Once Upon a Time in America (1984), we know he can do much better than that. I don't know what Scorsese was thinking there.Other than that, I give Casino a 9 out of 10."
"As films of around 3 hours go, this is one that will be able to keep you glued to the screen from start to finish - and it is easy to see why.Looking first at the director, Martin Scorsese, he has once again turned out another masterpiece through not only his standard creative cinematography but through the use of an extremely clever and entertaining series of narratives from both central and cameo roles.The lead actors have also done themselves proud in this film. Each of them allowing you a truthful and honest insight into  their individual persona's, giving the viewer a closeness to the characters and their plight that is rarely seen in films of today.This film is frequently compared I think unfairly to 'Goodfellas'. Although the underlying theme is similar. 'Casino' has much less down time for the viewer and allows you to work away feeling less empty than 'Goodfellas' does.With some of the most violent scenes since 'Reservoir Dogs' it is certainly not for the squeemish but certainly well worth a look.9 out of 10."
"Now I've seen a lot of films.  And I have seen a lot of gangster films. But Casino...what can I say.  I've heard people say that this was simply Scorcese's attempt to remake Goodfellas in a different part of America.  I would say that while the idea behind it is the same, this has a very different feel to it.  Goodfellas was pure gangster stuff.  It was Liotta's ""Hey, this is a cool life"" description of how everything happened.  Casino was more ""How we f***ed everything up"" from the view of the cool De Niro. Scorcese simply used a winning formula, his usual winning cast and his usual classy soundtrack technique to put together what is the most absorbing film I have ever seen.  It may be very complicated to understand how the 'skims' work and which boss is which, but that's unnecessary.  The harrowing scenes with Pesci remain in the mind and De Niro's ice cold reactions as Stone falls apart make this a brilliant film.  Watch it.  Watch it again.  And I promise you, you will not be disappointed."
"This movie was great! The is was one of the best cast ever assembled, and the dialogue was great. When I watched this, I remembered when the Simpsons were watching Casino on TV and they said, ""Casino, starring Joe Pesci, due to violent content, Joe Pesci will not be seen."" Its so true. But even though Pesci's character was extremely violent, they showed the good side of him, making breakfast for his kid every morning. Sharon Stone finally shows she can do drama, and be believable. She shows that there can be slums in Las Vegas, while everyone around her is doing just fine. Then there is De Niro who stands as the calm, sensible guy that only f**ks everything up by making few very small mistakes. But ironically, he is the only one left, and continues his gambling life, and by what it looks like, succeeds.Great Movie!"
"It would be difficult to find a flaw in this film. It has been criticised for its violence - its a violent story, its language - the characters swear a lot, and even that it has all been done before - is there a completely original idea anywhere? I really liked the use of the narrative too.I must admit, I saw a television version so a great deal of the language and violence was removed, but this was still a polished and classy film with an engaging story-line and talented cast. This film of paradise slowly unravelling is an interesting morality tale. Definitely worth a watch. My vote 8/10"
"Casino shows that GoodFellas, the milieu if not the overall tenor as this is more of a full-blown epic in Las Vegas can still be well done when people like Martin Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi do it right.For a long time this was among the top, top favorites from this director. I don't know if it's still one of THE bestest of the best, but it's still massively enjoyable and after all these years there's still things to love about it. And, actually, though he got the Oscar for Goodfellas, Pesci might actually be *better* here, more nuanced, crazier, more on-fire, more F-bombs. So much underrated material here. And who doesn't dig James Woods as a pimp and Don Rickles as a casino manager?"
"This might not be Scorsese's worst movie  (that would be  *Kundun*), but it may be his most negligible movie, given that it's very much a remake of the director's own  *GoodFellas*, which was a pretty empty affair to begin with. That makes  *Casino*  extremely empty -- call it a black hole.Once again, we get the nonstop soundtrack comprised of Bobby Vinton-esque oldies and 70's album rock.  Oh, there's snatches of grand opera, too, especially when little Joe Pesci is killing someone.  The point of all this music, presumably, is to punctuate with either emphasis or irony what we're seeing on the screen . . . an easy indicator that the director doesn't have much to show us.  And in case that wasn't enough, Scorsese tries to fill the gaps with nonstop -- and I mean, NONSTOP -- voice-over narration.  This may be one of the few movies a blind person could watch without missing anything.  As cinema is a visual medium, I'm obviously not being complimentary to Mr. Scorsese, here.Scorsese keeps trying to outdo his earlier film with MORE narration, more walk-on characters, more gruesome violence  (one guy gets his head squeezed in a vice), more domestic squabbling, more more more.  But it's all meaningless, quite apart from being as boring as hell.  What we have here is the story of small player from the Kansas City mob  (Robert DeNiro)  who wants to be a big player.  His bosses send him to Vegas, where he feels he has a real opportunity to not only be a player, but to be  ""legit""  in the bargain by becoming a real casino boss.In the meantime, he's got to deal with an old associate, the violent Joe Pesci, and a whory wife  (Sharon Stone)  who's addicted to drugs and, most laughably, a mullet-haired James Woods.  I can buy the whole wife thing, maybe . . . men WILL do stupid things when it comes to blondes.  But I absolutely cannot take Joe Pesci seriously as a fearsome, bloodthirsty mobster who blows into Vegas looking for his own action.  De Niro and Pesci should've portrayed each other's roles.  But what do I know."
"This is, unquestionably in my opinion, the best film of all time. I wont waste time outlining the plot in detail, I'm sure other reviews have that covered. The mixed reaction this film has been given has absolutely stunned me, reviews range from the worst film people have ever seen to the most impressive they have ever seen. This is of course the most underrated film of all time and not enough credit has been given to Scorsese, De Niro, pesci, stone and even the supporting cast including frank Vincent. The reason for much of this films criticism is its comparisons to goodfellas. This is not goodfellas or a goodfellas inspired film! (despite Nicholas peliggi's involvement). De niro and pesci surpass their performance in goodfellas with much to spare in this film. Pesci in particular has added more venom to his performance than seen in goodfellas (which was already as venomous as a venomous snake swimming around in venom).Enough of this goodfellas talk, casinos finest quality is the development of the characters throughout the movie. The decade in which this movie covers allows Scorsese to work his magic and has time to brilliantly lay out this fascinating tale of the mob's control of a las Vegas casino...and the las Vegas streets. De niro is at his usual best which means long time movie partner Scorsese can direct with ease because nobody is better than De niro at his best. His performance is cool, calm and collected and his character is easily likable and understandable throughout. De niro's casual performance means it is down do pesci to take care of the more brutal parts of the movie, and he does this very well. Scorseses directing skills combined with De niro's fine acting and laced with pesci's raw power, not to mention a sprinkle of glitter on top in the form of Sharon stone, means there is no level on which this film does not deliver. the best there is, the best there was and the best there ever will be."
"Please stop the music! - no spoilers""Casino"" is the only movie I ever walked out on.Halfway through the film I found myself thinking ""Oh well, `Nights in White Satin""! Is it by the `Moody Blues`?"" and ""This is the second Stones (or someone else) song..."". Then I realized how bored I was and how annoying it is to listen to music instead of watching a movie.During the whole film the sound track just never stops playing 70s music. I wonder what for?! Let the acting and the story carry the film but alas that´s the problem. It´s just boring, it doesn´t work. I guess the producers saw this mess of a film and added the soundtrack in an attempt to save the movie from being a complete disaster. But they did for the worse.
My rating: 1/10 Macauley J. Connor"
"""Casino"" (1995), a visceral examination of the Mafia's influence on the casinos of Las Vegas in the 1970s, is also the so-called ""companion piece"" to Martin Scorsese's ""GoodFellas"" (1990). Both films star Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, and were written by Nicholas Pileggi.Some even go so far as to claim ""Casino"" is a semi-remake of ""GoodFellas."" And many critics found flaws regardless of its connections to the earlier mob film. ""Go in interested and you may find your interest tested way past the limit,"" wrote Mick LaSalle in the San Francisco Chronicle. ""'Casino' is not about people, just Vegas. It's an ambitious film -- but also a scattered, unfocused one."" Viewing the movie a decade after its release, it holds up well. The film's real strength lies in its narrative and unflinching examination of its characters. Sam Rothstein (played by Robert De Niro) isn't a nice guy, and never really gains our sympathy. Nicky (Pesci) occasionally exhibits acceptable behavior, but if the film has a villain, it's him. And Ginger (Sharon Stone in the best role of her career) is selfish, spoiled and depressing.Critics didn't get it. ""'Casino' runs a little under three hours, but (you) will feel like it is at least five due to the plodding pace by editor Thelma Schoonmaker,"" wrote Internet critic Steve Rhodes. Rhodes, along with countless other reviewers, complained about the level of violence  suggesting an NC-17 rating would have been more appropriate.Whether you will like ""Casino"" or not depends entirely on your tolerance for character-driven films  and, of course, heavy violence. Ironically, despite its flaws, ""Casino"" is closer to Scorsese's older work than any of his other recent films  ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Raging Bull"" did not feature likable people, either. Whereas we followed Henry Hill's journey from youth in ""GoodFellas"" and felt empathetic towards him, ""Casino"" drops us square in the middle of Sam's story and there's no connection  this will either alienate or enthrall you, depending entirely on your taste in cinema. I personally love studies of characters  especially ones that examine the evil inherent in man, and Scorsese is brilliant at revealing these things.His movie exhibits recognizable elements  a whiz-bang style with quick-cuts, rapid zooms, a diverse pop-and-classical music soundtrack (with no less than four or five Rolling Stones songs), and of course, his famous tracking shots (here, he stages an impressive three-minute examination of a casino without breaking until we exit the front door). But ""Casino"" doesn't confine itself to the restraints of Scorsese's styling. Here he goes hog wild with the visuals (more so than usual anyway), soaking up the vivid colors of Las Vegas, absorbing the dizzying array of flashing bulbs and tacky bright clothing.Editor Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time collaborator, experiments with digital editing for the first time here  and employs some new techniques that are subtle but make a subliminal impact. The title sequence, designed by Elaine and Saul Bass, is simultaneously dazzling and haunting.The performances are almost flawless. De Niro is Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein, a legendary gambler who is chosen out of the blue to maintain a new casino for the Las Vegas Mafia. Sam explains the economics of the system  the mob take their cut of the profits, the rest goes where it should, and everyone remains happy  so long as nothing goes wrong.When Ace's old friend Nicky shows up in Vegas he begins to orchestrate a ring of violent robberies  becoming the new leader of a vicious gangster force that threatens to destroy Ace's chances at cutting it straight. Since Nicky is a made man, and Ace is Jewish, he can't stop him  but fears their new lifestyle will only lead to misery.In the meantime Ace falls for the beautiful call girl Ginger (Stone), who doesn't love Sam, but marries him for his wealth. Her heart really belongs to her ex-boyfriend/pimp (played by James Woods), and at first Ace believes he can tame her into submission; but her free spirit ruins their lives and destroys Ace's confidence.The movie does have its blunders, and is not on the same level as ""GoodFellas,"" but would at least make the list a few titles beneath it. Some scenes seem unnecessary, and Nicky's violent attack with a pen does seem a bit reminiscent of an almost identical sequence in ""GoodFellas"" when Pesci attacks someone at a bar. And as enthralling and entertaining as ""Casino"" is, it never really matches the overall energetic exuberance of ""GoodFellas""  they are, despite their close ties, very different films in a cinematic sense.Still, this is a great film, well made and daring. You'll probably either love it or hate it, but there's no denying its powerful impact on the viewer."
"Casino(1995) is a fascinating and terrific behind the scenes look at the mob undergoings in Las Vegas during the 1970's and early 80's.  It deals with things that were hinted at in The Godfather(1972).  Casino(1995) received mixed reviews during its release which was due to ignorance from most film critics.  This film is one of the reasons why Martin Scorsese is the best film-maker of his generation.The opening credits are beautifully done using colors to a greater effect. Casino(1995) is a film that was most deserving of a Best Picture award in 1995.  It should be considered as one of the top films of the 1990's. This is an another example of Martin Scorsese being done in by the Academy Award voters as he should have at least five Best Director[Mean Streets(1973, Taxi Driver(1976), Raging Bull(1980), Goodfellas(1990), and Casino(1995)], and six Best Picture awards[Mean Streets(1973), Taxi Driver(1976), Raging Bull(1980), The Last Temptation of Christ(1988), Goodfellas(1990), and Casino(1995)].
The infamous ""Batting Practice"" scene near the end of the film is one of the five most brutal and vicious sequences in a Scorsese Flick.  The first part of the film are a summary of events and the narrative does not begin until twenty minutes into the story.  Its filled with multiple voice overs from Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Frank Vincent.  It was written by the same man who wrote Goodfellas(1990).Casino(1995) takes a look at the upper level mafia as Goodfellas(1990) looked into the lives of low to mid level hoods.  This film deals with the themes of excess, greed, power, and self-destruction.  Like in other Scorsese films, the violence here is sudden and comes out unexpectively. Robert De Niro as Sam is at odds between being loyal to his bosses and retaining some kind of intregity.There are a few scenes that were really masterful.  One, the scene where Sam explains the different roles of the people working at the casino.  Two, the murders during the climax of the movie. Three, introductions of the main and minor characters in the story.One asset of this movie is Scorsese's Utilization of music used to fit many scenes and situations.  It deals with the end of an era when the mob controlled Las Vegas.  The camera is always on the move as well as being fluid and steady.  The difference between this film and Scorsese's early works is this film doesn't have the gritty of of his 1970s films.Casino(1995) is one of Martin Scorsese's three or four best films of the 1990's and that includes Goodfellas(1990), The Age of Innocence(1993), and Kundun(1998).  Casino was the eighth coraboration between Scorsese & De Niro.  Many scenes(gory ones) were cut from this feature in order to avoid an NC-17 rating.  Casino follows in the tradition of gangster epics ala, The Godfather(1972), The Godfather Part 2(1974), Scarface(1983), Once Upon A Time in America(1984), and Goodfellas(1990).One of the film's best lines is ""Before she could start counting her money, the bosses back home decided to settle the case out of court, so they sent me"".  Everyone contributes to the excellent acting in Casino.  Sharon Stone gives the best performance of her life.  In my opinion, Sam Rothstein represents Martin Scorsese and the mob bosses symbolizes the Hollywood execs.Casino is more a big budget lavish Independant film then it is a mainstream feature.  Robert De Niro as Sam plays him with unusual restraint espically for Robert De Niro.  Joe Pesci plays a more psychotic version of Tommy De Vito of Goodfellas(1990).  After getting brutally beaten by a Pesci character in Raging Bull(1980), and Goodfellas(1990), Frank Vincent finally gets a chance to return the favor.Scorsese directs with the craft of an experienced pro.  Sam Rothstein is based on career of professional bookie Frank""lefty"" Rosenthal.  This would be the final appearence of the mother of Martin Scorsese in one of his movies.  Casino(1995) as many years pass is a movie that will be acknowledged as one of the director's all time greats."
"Right from the opening sequence, with De Niro dressed in a cerise jacket and shirt, getting into car that blows up, and then circling across the title credits, it was clear this movie was going to be a stinker. I don't care if Martin Scorsese directed it. Even monkeys fall out of trees. Why would a cartel of rich men hand over control of a casino to a handicapper, i.e. someone who is good at betting. You need someone who is good at organisation and leadership, a CEO. Any rich man would know that. If he didn't know that, he wouldn't be rich. So the premise, introduced in the first minute, makes no sense. Joe Pesci's yapping voice - as a narrator?! Some silly staged stabbing in a bar over a pen. The other man's hostility didn't even make sense. Just a lazy set up to show how vicious the Joe Pesci character was. And Robert De Niro falls for the annoying girl that's stealing chips from men and throwing everyone's chips around, when with the status of a casino boss, he could choose any of 1000 non-annoying, non-criminal women? Time to stop watching."
"It should be clear to anyone who has followed Scorsese's career that he continues to fall back on several crutches in the construction of this film: casting his cute lil' mama, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci and a boat load of the other goombas who ended up on ""The Sopranos""; the utilization of character voiceovers (a totally lazy device employed by otherwise ineffective storytellers) and yet another boring and way-too-loud classic rock soundtrack handpicked by a guy still living in the 60's. We get it, Marty: you REALLY like The Stones.Take your pick, and I will show you several films for which Scorsese received well more credit than he deserves: the muddy, ponderous ""Mean Streets,"" the mediocre ""Taxi Driver,"" the execrable ""New York, New York"" and ""The Color of Money,"" and the predictable duo of ""Cape Fear"" and ""The Departed,"" the latter of which was utterly ruined by Mark Wahlberg's shrill, one-note performance. Additionally, Scorsese's overblown video to Michael Jackson's ""Bad"" was complete jive and gave the regrettable Wesley Snipes a stairway to stardom.Ultimately, ""Casino"" is poor relation to the superior ""Goodfellas,"" which, along with ""The King of Comedy,"" is Scorsese's only film worthy of the heaps of praise showered upon his overall body of work. I should also mention that Sharon Stone's performance in ""Casino"" is just plain embarrassing. Don't get me wrong, friends. I think Martin Scorsese is a decent filmmaker, but he sure ain't Cinema Jesus."
"The opening 30 minutes or so of ""Casino"" embodies everything that I adore about pre-21st century Martin Scorsese cinema, most particularly the excellent craftsmanship he seems to have lost his grip in on recent years. As the picture begins, we get this fabulous quasi-documentary narrative with Robert De Niro, as the film's protagonist—nobody with any sense of morality can call a mob figure a hero—providing us all the details. What he's been given to say is fascinating, and the way Scorsese coordinates his camera is superb. The technique is pure, the edits are crisp and clean (there are none of those horrendous, in-your-face jump cuts that stabbed his 2006 film ""The Departed"" clean through the heart), and the amount of detailed information presented in an entertaining way. Scorsese and his co-screenwriter, Nicolas Pileggi, both of whom collaborated on the 1990 gangster masterpiece ""GoodFellas,"" are certainly to be commended as researchers. In this fabulous first half-hour, they know just when and where to tell us data about how the mob ran a Las Vegas casino and when to show us. They tell us who watches who during a big gambling night, and show us, in splendid detail, how to get rid of a cardsharp by giving him a bogus heart attack.Unfortunately, for me, once Sharon Stone, as a prostitute who sets the protagonist's heart aflame, enters the picture, everything begins to drag. This is not a negative reflection on Sharon Stone's performance. Not only is this her best piece of work that I'm aware of—I personally do not think she's untalented as an actress—but she gives the best performance of the entire movie. There isn't a bad performance, really, but she does dominate everybody else in ""Casino."" So it's not her acting that wears out the movie for me; it's the pretentious and uninteresting melodrama that follows in her tracks.The pseudo-romantic dynamic between De Niro and Stone is, at heart, just an old-fashioned gangster-and-his-moll story, with the feisty woman first being pushed around, then pushing back, standing up to the boyfriend with the gun. Why does this dynamic go wrong? Because the screenplay tries to make something monumentally important out of it all. It tries to go deep, explore the psyches of both characters, takes them out of the casino and into the deserts and apartments of Las Vegas, and attempts to bring a psychologically fascinating angle to their relationship. Here, it completely falls apart, and the remaining two and a half hours of the movie—the middle in particularly—really begins to drag. The other problem with this relationship is that De Niro's character is not interesting when the movie tries to explore his depth as a person. He's much more interesting in the old-fashioned personality of the 'rough-and-touch, silent but deadly' casino manager who, save for his cameras, supervises everything that goes in his establishment. Once he gets all mucky and muggy with Stone, the fascination is wiped clean from the slate. As was my ability to stay interested.I wish that ""Casino"" had stayed inside the casinos and not gone into the deserts, apartments, swamps, of outer Las Vegas. For me, the heart of the movie was contained in that big, luxurious building with the omnipresent colors. And I do not see why the movie could not have just stayed there and told its story from that setting, venturing outside only when necessary. Obviously, it's based on true events, but since the true events, as told on screen, become this dull, what's the point? Even Joe Pesci, essentially repeating his performance from ""GoodFellas,"" seems to have little purpose outside the casino. There's some promising sequences with him forcing De Niro to come down in the middle of the night to get him fifty million-dollar chips for a gambling rage, but, once again, once the story leaves the casino and starts getting involved with all the other stuff, it goes downhill.But to the filmmakers' credit, having Pesci narrate part of the story does make his denouement all the more surprising. I will not give away exactly what happens, but the way things unfold toward the end, with Pesci's narration almost completely eradicating De Niro's, really does leave the audience unexpected for what eventually turns out. It's a brilliant touch.I admired the physical production values of ""Casino"" as much as any great-looking movie I've ever seen, and Scorsese's flair as a director is very impressive. But even though the technique is pure, the storytelling seems half-baked and uninterested in itself. And that's the coldest feeling a movie can possibly give you. Whether it's representational or not, when you get the notion that the filmmaker lost interest in the story he was telling, it's all for nothing."
"I just started Martin Scorsese's movies one by one. By far this is the best movie ever. After I saw this movie, I read about the goofs in this site and to be frank I observed only two of them and I watch movies very closely.This is one of the best examples where director actually glues your bum to the seat.Absolutely no highs or lows in the movie, the tempo is carried from very first scene, continuing in every frame until the last one.Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone gave amazing performance. I felt jealous and pitied at Sam, frightened at Nicky and hated Ginger. Amazing performers and superb action. I never ever felt that it was a movie and everything is screen-played.With the naive experience in watching Marin's movies, I guess camera becomes a slave to Martin ( of course right after Coppola). Beautiful angles and wonderful screenplay.And of course Nicholas Pileggi is genius to begin with and Martin Scorsese is another to go into Nicholas' head and produce the same.A beautiful movie which actually defines an R rated film without any gross scenes."
"I am a modern movie buff (meaning my movie history starts with films like Scarface and Ferris Bueller's Day Off, not Casablanca or From Here to Eternity).  I have seen close to 500 movies in my day - everything from DC Cab to Fast Break to A Bronx Tale - and Casino is without a shadow of a doubt the best I have ever watched.  DeNiro is sublime, Stone gives the best performance of her career, and Pesci is at his obnoxious, menacing best. The costumes, the score, the dialogue.  My brother and I can have whole conversations with each other talking only in quotes from the flick: (""Mr. Clark I don't think you understand what it is I do.  ...  About the time I'm coming out of jail, hopefully, you'll be coming out of your coma.  And I'll bust your head wide open again.  Cause I'm f***in' stupid."")  There was a time when I thought nothing could touch The Godfather II as the ultimate mob drama with a real plot and authentic characters who make you care.  Then I saw Casino during my sophomore year in college, and, for me, nothing has come close cinematically.  If you loved the gore of The Untouchables, then this is for you.  If you loved the tragedy of Carlito's Way, then Casino is for you.  If you loved the authenbticity of Donnie Brasco then this flick is for.  Hell, if you loved the warped, anal retentive Melvin Udall in As Good As It Gets, then Sam Rothstein will blow you away.  Whatever you want in a movie, you got it here - with the notable exception of minority actors, save a few Japanese ""whales"" inserted only for storytelling purposes.  I challenge any true movie critic to name three movies with more depth, a better plot, a better narrarator, better actors than this epic.  After 50 plus viewings I'm still searching."
"Having read most of the comments about this film, I'm shocked how anyone liked it.  3 hours of a half hearted attempt to remake Goodfellas.  Lets get a bunch of very talented actors and normally good director and make a film for the sake of it.This film is so pointless, it's predictable from the start and nothing really happens.  It's all been seen before, oh and lets throw in some meaningless violence that'll make it look arty.All the scene's are well acted and even well filmed, but to what end.  The story goes no where.  It's an obvious, boring, gangster story, that's been done a thousand times before.The reason it's so disappointing is all the talent involved, surely they could have done something better than this."
"Any cinephile could easily place CASINO in their top 25 favorite movies ever. There have been countless times when I turned to the channel it was then being shown on - just to see what scene it's up to - and end up finishing the last two hours of the film. The way it arrests almost anyone's attention is one of the hallmarks of a Scorsese film, and it is in this aspect that movie-lovers find his genius. The casting is superb. Ace Rothstein - played by Robert DeNiro, a Scorsese regular - is probably the perfect model of what every aspiring gentleman wishes to one day become. The gorgeous Sharon Stone's performance is probably the best in her career as Ginger, but it is really Joe Pesci who shines most in this film. From his accent to his attitude, Pesci perfectly depicts the kind of criminal Nicky Santoro and his real- life persona were.Anyone who even casually likes movies should definitely invest the three hours and watch CASINO. The way Scorsese brings you into the world of the casino and shows you the then-criminal element of its inner workings will give every viewer that curious yearning to participate in the dangers and defiance that all great crime movies instill. While we watch, most of us know what is happening on the screen is wrong, yet somehow we all want to be a part of it - admittedly or not :)"
"Scorsese is my favorite director working today. From his first great film Mean Streets to Wolf of Wall Street, he's given the world some amazing movies. Some are better than others of course, but I would be hard pressed to say that's he's ever made a bad film. Casino, when first released, was unfavorably compared to Scorsese's Goodfellas, and it's easy to see why. Based on another Nicholas Pileggi crime novel, the returning cast members Robert DeNiro, Frank Vincent and Joe Pesci, a long running time and ""rise and fall of a gangster"" plot. But while Goodfellas is my number one Scorsese film (Followed closely by Raging Bull), Casino has slowly become one of my favorites. The violence is still sometimes hard to watch, two scenes come to mind that in my opinion, rival anything in Goodfellas in terms of visceral, shocking brutality. The infamous torture scene is still shocking, comparable to the ear amputation in Reservoir Dogs. Scorsese's eye for detail and use of narration serves him well, and the acting is across the board excellent. Sharon Stone deservedly won an Oscar for her role as hustler Ginger McKenna. And Joe Pesci is on fine form as hot tempered, coked-up muscle Nicky Santoro. The eclectic soundtrack is great, filled with 70s classics like Jeff Beck's ""I Ain't Superstitious"" and Boogaloo Down Broadway. Robert Richardson's cinematography is amazing, capturing the gaudy style of the era perfectly. And longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker edits the film beautifully and doesn't shy away from the sometimes brutal violence. There are a few flaws. You could trim about 10 minutes of Nicky Santoro and his gang (We get the point, they're bad guys). And Robert DeNiro looks about as Jewish as Vladimir Putin. But these are minor complaints. A great film that i'll watch over and over for years to come. Highly recommended."
"Just to give a bit of background, I thought I'd start by explaining what it actually takes for me to score a film 10/10, because at this point the top score on here has lost a lot of it's significance. Not that this is a serious issue obviously, but I thought I should open by stating exactly how good I think a film should be in order for it to justify a rating like that, and hopefully in doing so the point will be put across as to how highly I rate this film.For me, a 10/10 film is a film whereby not only each and every facet of is at least of a very high standard, but one that is so good that there is literally no single aspect of it that stands out as being even marginally weak, whether that be the acting performance of a character, a particular scene/section of the film, the dialogue or any other aspect that could be picked up on. Right from the off, the film must set a standard and a tone and keep on that course so as to at least remain within the same bracket of quality, whilst also excelling in every possible aspect along the way. Any deviation from this path represents an imperfection in terms of the way the film is balanced, and as such will prevent a perfect 10/10 score from being given.Given this criteria, take The Godfather as an example: a timeless masterpiece that is rightfully held up as one of the greatest films of all time. The acting is sublime, the plot is compelling and the characters are all well fashioned. Despite these strengths however, Michael's development at the start is not handled with the same precision and quality as the rest of the film in my opinion. It stands out as being more rushed and less carefully crafted when measured against the rest of the film, and I felt the opening stages were in need of a couple more scenes to bridge the early phases of the transformation with what followed. This stood out for me in context of the quality of the rest of the film, and I would therefore deduct half a point on that basis. The difference in quality here is enough for me to call it a sizable imperfection in a relative sense.Another example to use is Once Upon A Time In America, which is sometimes labelled 'the best gangster movie ever made', with people highlighting the exceptional plot and the wonderful soundtrack by Ennio Morrocone. These are, of course, valid points - the music is amongst some of the finest ever made for film, and the plot is as absorbing as it is complex. That being said, the acting is considerably lower across the board than in other classics in similar genres (Goodfellas, Godfather I and II, City of God, etc), and the score is often applied over-indulgently: the melodies of Deborah's theme and the main theme for example are destroyed by the end of the film, and scenes are sometimes made to seem exaggerated and jarring as a result. On top of that, there are occasions whereby these beautiful melodies are highly inappropriate, with one particular rendition actually making me laugh loud because of how bizarre it was (hint: the Cleopatra part of the film, after the...incident...in the car).For those reasons, despite it's strengths, that film is an 8/8/5 for me. Very good, but there are too many imperfections and imbalances.Anyway, I give that brief analysis of those two up there in order to illustrate my view that there are no literally no such relative imperfections and imbalances to point out with Casino. The film starts off well paced and sharp, and from the very offset it maintains an extremely high standard of acting, storytelling and pacing throughout.Even nitpicking, I cannot think of a single weakness, and on top of that the strengths are seriously strong. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, as usual, are fantastic in their roles, and I honestly can't remember ever seeing anyone play a character like Sharon Stone plays in this so well. For all the right reasons, she made me feel hateful, angry and unpleasant. I cowered and cringed because of how well it was acted, and I spent most of the time watching her thinking about how much I wanted her character to meet a horrible, yet just ending.Seriously... this film is a must-watch. There are a lot of unfair, unfavourable comparisons to Goodfellas in here, but I honestly think this is better. Does Goodfellas keep up the same standard of plot like this does throughout? I don't think so personally - the closing scenes are slower and weaker, where as Casino maintains an extremely high level, delivering accordingly right at the end. The ending is satisfying (for whatever reason - no spoilers here), and the tension that has been built up throughout is sufficiently capitalised on. Goodfellas, on the other hand, more peters out by comparison.That is obviously is not to criticise Goodfellas - as a film that's about as close to 10 as you can get without it being 10 in my opinion. It's just that Casino is better paced, more consistent and more complex and nuanced in its plot. As well as this, it gains from the greater emphasis on De Niro and Pesci, who both play superior, more fleshed out characters in this. The combination of these two and Sharon Stone in conjunction with this plot makes for an absolute masterpiece, and I highly recommend this film to anyone with even a passing interest in film and Scorsese. I was in awe of it throughout and think that, alongside Raging Bull, it's probably the most underrated film I've come across so far on IMDb."
"Talk with most guys, at least ones around my age and they'll tell you they're Goodfellas fans. In addition, or subtraction, they'll also mention Scarface and, no doubt, The Godfather I, II or both. (Laughably, no one ever seems to bring up III without wincing.) Me? I'm gambling Casino will be my mobster movie for all my days.It's a safe bet. Revisiting Casino, for the first time in probably a decade, is like visiting an old friend. And for three hours, it's a ride I can't wait to take again. For, I've done it many times before.I'm not one to like very long movies, or movies that move slowly – and before I go further, this is NOT one that ever moves a bit slowly. But, ever since it came out on video (originally on VHS, back then) I couldn't help myself. I literally watched this three-hour movie over and over. And over. To the point sometimes, when it went to credits, I would insert tape one (yeah, again, VHS, humph!) and start from the beginning.I lovedand STILL DOthis movie so much, in so many ways, it was easy for me to continuously watch it. With this third purchase – VHS, DVD and now, BluRay, I can't wait to plug it to experience it another time.This movie is so near perfect on so many levels and depths, it's hard to sum it all up in one review. The movie's onion layers keep surprising me with each viewing. And it's bonus of two movies in one is fantastic.Movie One, or the first half, is made up of all-but fantastic, interesting and driven narration of how casinos work, the rise of the two best friends/street guys and the mobsters in 1970's Las Vegas. From all my research and first-hand experience, this mentality of the 1970's is fairly close to what it is today. In fact, it's almost dead-on. Naturally, some things do NOT happen today – the place is now like Disneyland: any bad press is VERY bad for the place. So, good luck in smashing a cheater's hands and not having a hundred reporters/bloggers tearing apart your casino the same hour.Movie Two involves every bit of the mistakes these guys made in order to eventually rid Las Vegas of the mob. (There's a lot more to it than from this movie, but for this story, it's centered on these wise guys.) Originally, when I watched this countless times, I narrowed it down to one main slip-up: the firing of a connected relative. But, examining it this time, there were so many nudges to their house of cards, it's hard to add them all up. Each and every bump to the base playing cards had an involvement to everyone's downfall.To top it all off, it's enormously interesting, fun, exciting and suspenseful to see how this well-laid based on true events played out. Oh, and I haven't even gotten to the acting.I never once saw Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone or James Woods (amongst others) on the screen. Ever. These people were truly Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, Nicky Santoro, Ginger McKenna and Lester Diamond, respectively. How each of these excellent performances did NOT win Oscars is beyond me. Actually, while we're at it, how the movie didn't get nominated for, and win, for Best Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, Cinematography, Score, etc...baffles me.I digress. These performances were mesmerizing. Each in their own way. All the way down to James Woods, whom I felt did the best of his career and Sharon Stone showing incredible depth.Beyond the incredible feats by the actors was the brilliant direction, cinematography, story, score, soundtrack and pacing. Never did this movie feel slow, nor did I ever ""check the time counter"" because it's nearly three hours. The movie just kept going and on the right course. The plot unfolds as it needs to and the recounting of events and voice-overs were just as interesting as what was on screen.This movie was so powerful, as were the performances, that I almost rooted for De Niro's Ace. His gal, Ginger (Stone,) not so much. On a side note, she was fairly despicable and we wouldn't have hated her so much, if not for Stone's great take on her. (Or, again, the weasel, Woods as Lester.)Normally, I would absolutely and readily admit that I love this movie ten times more than the already very good Goodfellas or Godfather series because I am a gambler and have always (since early teens) been infatuated with Las Vegas and its history. It would be obvious that I'm naturally biased because of the reasons just mentioned. But, I am being honest: past my obsession with both gambling and Vegas, I loved this movie on all levels. Yes, it does help that this gives me a much more in-depth view of a certain segment of Vegas' past, I still love the journey Director Martin Scorsese gives me eachand...every time."
"When I saw Martin Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"" -which just so happens to be one of my all-time favorite films- I had an urge to see his other movies.I'll agree with pretty much everyone and say that ""Casino"" is no ""Goodfellas"".But who cares? This is a fascinating and powerfully dramatic film with great performances by Robert De Niro and the unforgettably talented Joe Pesci who won the Oscar for best supporting actor in ""Goodfellas"". No one can play a more dramatic role and act as dramatic as Pesci.He can blurt the F-word several times non-stop and go absolutely berserk on screen, which really captivated me in ""Goodfellas"" and now has done it again in ""Casino"".I'm kinda upset with the movies rating on Yahoo by the film critics.Why and how did this movie get a B- by the critics.Okay, I'm with Roger Ebert on this one and I'm gonna say that it's an absolutely great film.Everyone else can go chop their schlong off and die somewhere.Not as good as ""Goodfellas"", but like ""Goodfellas"", it's a four-star masterpiece by the legendary Martin Scorsese and I wonder if he'll ever make another mob movie.If he does, I'm there."
"""Casino"" is a near perfect and almost classic crime film. Why ""almost""? Well, in my particular case, it reminds me of ""Goodfellas"" way too much. You know, the plot, some characters, violence, etc.Being objective, I think ""Casino"" is very well made. It has excellent Direction courtesy of Mr. Scorcese who once again proves he's a top class act. He created a dynamic, slick, spectacular movie with the aid of avid camera angles and his well known style.The acting is superb. Robert De Niro demonstrates he's one of the most versatile actors in modern film history. His display of different emotions, courage, and temper is outstanding. His character required plenty of temper. Sharon Stone delivers a very good performance. She's a fine actress. Joe Pesci once again shows his incredible talent while portraying mobsters. James Woods and other supporting actors deliver memorable performances.The atmosphere is splendid. You really get to feel the vibe of a casino even if it takes place in another era. The whole gambling, tactics, and obscure interests behind the business is impressing. This should be considered as a classic crime film. The 90's had genre defining movies and ""Casino"" perfectly follwed the tendency. It brought to cinema something never explored that way and it generated plenty of follow-ups."
"I haven't seen too many Scorsese films. I've seen The Departed, The Aviator, and 'most' of GoodFellas. I just watched Casino last night and I think I can say it is one of the best, most involving and well-directed films I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of movies. The acting is great, De Niro and Pesci giving wonderful performances of 'Ace' and Nicky, respectively. I haven't seen Sharon Stone in any film before, but she also gave a great performance as Ace's wife Ginger.In a way, Casino is a companion piece to GoodFellas. However, it needs to be judged as a film in it's own right. GoodFellas is a great movie, one that almost anyone can enjoy. But Casino, to me, is more in depth and gives a much more detailed look into the 'big' mobs, the ones that ran Vegas.The photography is great, especially the camera movement. The voice-over narration may be more than you heard in GoodFellas, but in a way it's necessary to get into the minds of Nicky and Ace. It's like a documentary and these guys are just giving us the facts. Not using a traditional film score also helps to make it feel more 'natural', the pop music selected to give exactly the right mood to its respective seen. Particularly the 'House of the Rising Sun' played towards the end over a sort of 'epilogue'. It not only fit's the scene, but the film as a whole.I think it's hard to actually say or write what this film is about, like any great film. All you can do is watch it and find out for yourself."
"Had me on the edge of my seat most of the time. Pesci is scary period. Dinero is possibly the greatest actor of my generation. Throw those two in a greatly scripted film and surround them with great supporting actors and you cant help but make a great movie.I don't consider this Goodfellas 2 but its close. Its a variant with two actors carried over. Don't get me wrong, This film stands very well on its own merit. If you never saw Goodfellas it wouldn't matter.You can always tell a great movie when you forget you are watching one.The violence is very scary and powerful. I grimaced several times the first time I saw it. The realism is there in every sense.A great rise and fall movie. In certain respects its sad the old days are over. There was an aura about it. But on the other hand, the Mafia was just to damned violent."
I'm very pleased that this film has finaaly made the IMDb top 250....of course i feel it deserves to be much higher than it is right now...but who knows perhaps in time..people will see that it is much superior to another scorsces entry on this list...the departed.I personaaly like it just a tad more than goodfellas....diniro is great...pesci as another mobster psychopath but just a little more understated....and who could ever forget the performance of sharon stone.A 3 hour film is usually trying on one patience but this one moves...never gettling muddled or bogged down.This is perhaps one of those films that will gain stature through the ages.
"One of Scorsese's best films and one of the best films of the 90's; ""Casino"" in a no-holds-barred criminal drama that never ceases to entertain while at the same time, telling an extremely intriguing story. I'm not a big fan on gangster/mafia films (only a few exceptions), but this transcends my personal biases. The acting is phenomenal. De Niro, Stone and Pesci are perfectly cast and deliver performances with depth that is rarely seen on the big screen. Scorsese crafts this film with all of his usual intensity and the result is a masterpiece that certainly doesn't feel three hours long! Whether you like mafia films or not, give this one a try... you might be surprised. I certainly was."
"OK where do i begin, i'm flabbergasted! that Casino doesn't get the attention it deserves. Most critics will say ooo it's just a rehash of Mean Streets and Goodfellas. The film has similarities yes, he uses the same actors playing similar characters yes, but don't you think Scorsese realizes this, don't you think he casted them for this very reason! He not only uses the same actors, he uses the same songs on occasion, he even repeats shots, but in order to give the shot a different meaning. For me Casino is the third and probably final installment of his mob trilogy. With each film he climbs higher up the ranks! Mean Streets starts with local hoods, Goodfellas to the more organized gangsters and Casino to the very top of the chain. I think Casino is probably the finest out of the three, it is certainly the best to look at. The cinematography and use of sound in particular are almost unparalleled. He even uses music from Jean-Luc Godard's Le Mepris, which contrasts the two relationships that are falling apart. Do you really think Casino is just an overlong sequel, do you really think Scorsese would stoop that low. The editing alone is probably the best of his career. Critics are always afraid to pride new films over the classics (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull). Now they are great films don't get me wrong, but i believe Casino deserves to be up there with them, more so than Goodfellas. Some critics have gone on to the say the film fizzles out after the first act? What film were they watching, do they know nothing about narrative pacing. If the film were to continue the pace of the first act i think the majority of the audience would have heart attacks, if they don't anyway. Now get this, it's from the Rolling Stone review. OK, 'What trips up Casino is its straining toward art'. So what exactly do they think Scorsese should be straining for, it doesn't sound like they need a great deal of straining for their reviews. It's little comments like this that really get under my skin. OO Casino's too long, if you think you can put across that much information in a shorter time then you're welcome. OK, that's enough for one night, Casino is an epic gangster masterpiece. A landmark of the 90s. It's not Goodfellas no, in my opinion it's better. However, it does require the viewer to have seen Goodfellas to completely understand what Scorsese is trying to say. I hope time will give this film the recognition it deserves."
"What else can be said about Martin Scorcese? In Casino he directs another incredible unforgettable film. Once again partnering with the incomparable Robert De Niro and another of his favorite collaborators, Joe Pesci, he once again elicits superb performances. He also gets Sharon Stone to give the best performance of her career. The fact that the very talented James Woods would sign on to be the fourth wheel is a testement to Scorcse's reputation. Even Don Rickles adds something. He has an expression that if you mess with Ace, dire consequences will ensue. Great story, great attention to detail (eg. the spy plane running out of fuel), incredible acting = Sorcese masterpiece, 10/10."
"This Martin Scorsese film,Casino,depicts Las Vegas--it has a glittering, glamorous face, as well as a brutal, cruel one.It is based on the non- fiction book of the same name by Nicholas Pileggi, who also co-wrote the screenplay for the film with Scorsese.The movie stars Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci as Ace Rothstein and Nicky Santoro respectively, mobsters who move to Las Vegas to make their mark, live and work in this paradoxical world. Seen through their eyes, each as a foil to the other, the details of mob involvement in the casinos of the 1970's and '80's are revealed. Ace is the smooth operator of the Tangiers casino, while Nicky is his boyhood friend and tough strongman, robbing and shaking down the locals. However, they each have a tragic flaw--Ace falls in love with a hustler, Ginger,played by Sharon Stone, and Nicky falls into an ever-deepening spiral of drugs and violence.The movie is definitely one of the best made about the mob.It definitely ranks up there with The Godfather and another Scorsese film,Goodfellas. Excellent story and acting are both characteristics of the movie.The story was great in the sense that it focuses on the excesses of language, of violence, of ambition in the life-styles of the rich and infamous which makes the movie smart from start to finish.Also,great performances were given by the lead stars De Niro,Stone and Pesci. Finally,it reveals to us what is Las Vegas all about - inside and out. A movie that deserves a 10/10 rating!!!!"
"""Goodfellas"" takes Vegas sees Scorsese's usual players meandering their way through the expected labyrinth that is Lost Wages, Nevada. The mob portion is kept very brief near the front end, with DeNiro then heading West to man a mob-run casino. There's your basic dealings with skimming, teamsters, the feds, cheats, and whatnot. Pesci is then thrown into the mix as an enforcer to keep everybody who threatens DeNiro, in line. For good measure Stone arrives as an all-flash bimbette who placates well-to-do men with her wiles.My main problem with the film lied mostly in the Scorsese going shockingly against type. First, we have one of the most passive DeNiro performances of his Marty career, as a (Jewish??) guy I kept screaming at to take some freaking action. He allows those who pose a threat to his world to just walk all over him at an alarmingly high rate. Namely, Stone, whom he inexplicably has some undying love for, despite her personality not going beyond a hot blonde of opportunity. That he could be so incessantly forgiving, made me nuts. I kept praying for the explosive Bobby D. we all know and love to show up, but he never arrived.Then you have Pesci, basically aping his own ""Goodfellas"" character, as a leprechaun-esque tough guy whose main fear-striking device is drop F-bombs at top volume. Or kicking the sheeyit out of guys as long as he (Pesci) has others there to watch his back. At least his character takes an unexpected turn that we're told is a huge no-no in the mob culture.People have always been vastly divided on Stone; some hated her, some were surprised and vaunted high praise. I was pretty much on the fence with her, as her two-note (sexy or drunk) offering had your standard indifference to it.James Woods is wasted (and realizing who his co-stars were, seemed to go into Pesci mode for the one scene he was allotted), Rickles and Smothers are thrown in for some Vegas flair, with your usual assembly line of reliable Scorsese Italianos rounding out the supporting roles.Then there's Scorsese himself as they guy at the helm. I've never really been a fan of forced or tortuous violence in a film (the Freddys and Jasons were always quick about it), but where was it here??? Where's the Marty Scorsese of old who covered his filmstock in off-putting gore? The fact that he (finally) shoehorns in some toward the last reel was a real let-down.The film hardly drags, and the narration was an acceptable technique, but in the end I couldn't have cared less whatever happened to any of these people. Unlike ""Goodfellas,"" where, though the main characters were ""villians,"" I felt so awash in their journey by film's end, that you feel you've really been taken to another place by the actors. Casino, not in the slightest.At the very least Joe Bob Briggs had more than one scene. Because the drive-in will never dah!"
"I am a huge movie fan. As of this writing, I am 35 years old and have voted on nearly 1500 movies on IMDb. I've been a movie fan as far back as I can remember. And the best movie I've ever seen? You guessed it...Casino.If I had to describe this movie in one word, it would be ""exquisite"". From the images of slow rolling dice to the scintillating voice-overs of movie-legends Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci, each second of ""Casino"" shines brilliantly. It is a glorious film.""Casino"" doesn't get the credit it deserves, unfortunately. It somehow takes a back-seat to gangster films such as ""The Godfather"" and ""Goodfellas"", two highly inferior films. In nearly every regard, from camera-work to writing to acting, ""Casino"" trumps all other gangster films. If you haven't seen it yet, I envy you (as I would LOVE to see it again for the first time). Repeated viewings get better and better, but I was star-struck while watching ""Casino"" originally...and I'm sure you will feel the same. ""Casino"" is an amazing achievement. Many kudos Mr. Scorsese.It would be a mistake not to mention the tremendous cast...and they all bring their best work to the table. Sharon Stone, in particular, was tremendously impressive. Put it this way: When I originally seen ""Casino"" for the first time, Stone was one of my least-favorite actresses. After the movie, she was my favorite. She didn't just play ""Ginger"", she owned her! If I was asked my opinion on the ""Best Supporting Actress of all-time"", my vote would be Stone in ""Casino"". One of the best performances of all-time. Not to be overlooked is some of the all-time film greats in Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and James Woods. I am having difficult coming up with adjectives worthy enough to describe their performances. It's just an outstanding movie, played by outstanding actors, with outstanding direction.""Casino"" is like a theme park for movie-going adults. It has it all...Violence (including one absolutely BRUTAL scene to watch), gangsters, drugs, sex and plenty of profanity. But it's also about loyalty, friendships and relationships...in a gangster sort of way. Ever wondered what daily life would be for a mob-dealing gangster? Or a hit-man? Or a married whore? Or a pimp and golf hustler? ""Casino"" covers it all! Just sit back with your favorite drink or cigar...and ENJOY!!! :) Thanks for reading...now go see Casino!JD"
"This is based on 2-Disc Special Edition release. I have not read the book, nor did I know anything about the real people this was based(apart from what's on the Trivia page). And yes, in case you have heard... this is quite similar to Goodfellas. There's the obvious, such as Pileggi writing the novels behind both, and some of the same cast. Beyond that, though, the story-telling(such as the frequent and effective use of voice-over monologues, and multiple narrators, I could go on) and overall flavor are similar. And why not? It fits for one as well as the other and they're well-done and not the exact same film(having watched one does not mean you've already seen the other, I'll put it that way). The plot is engaging and interesting throughout. Characters are credible, well-developed and consistent. The acting is excellent, for everyone involved(including the kids). DeNiro and Pesci nail their roles, Stone gives what may be the most powerful performance of her career, and Woods is spot-on as always when given appropriate material. The dialog is impeccable, with countless memorable and well-delivered lines. Cinematography and editing are marvelous. The music is great, the score well-composed, and they are used expertly throughout this. This has constant strong language, plenty of brutal, bloody violence, disturbing content and a bit of sexuality. The DVD holds deleted scenes(among them an outtake or two) and six featurettes, four of which are on this site, and that I will review individually, the last two being a documentary called Vegas and the Mob and an episode of a History Channel show entitled True Crime Authors, both of them well worth the time. I recommend this to any fan of Scorsese and/or anyone else who helped make this. And that's that. 8/10"
"Most people I know haven't seen the true-story brutality that is Casino. Taking place in the early 1980s, two mob friends, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, are put in charge of a Las Vegas casino. Their job? To make certain everything runs smooth and to make sure that the bosses get their black bag of money. What happens? To put it into a short context: things start to fall apart. The dysfunction represented in this movie is amazing, every little thing leads to something worse. The beginning shows the rise of the Mafia's empire in Las Vegas: from the towering casinos to the floors of the casino, you get a little taste of everything in here. What's really interesting is that if you played by the rules, they treated you like gold, but if you double crossed them things could get pretty ugly (see the hammer scene). Casino, put simply, is a great movie. The only problem I experienced was that there were parts that seemed to drag out. The movie weighs in at a hefty 2hrs and 59min so don't expect to go anywhere soon. If you haven't see this yet then give it a chance, it really is a great movie."
"Easily surpasses Godfather and Goodfellas. The story is written very carefully and presented beautifully, with perfect narratives and dialogue throughout the movie.The characters are quite complex and display much depth, played by actors that live and breathe for these roles. Robert De Niro couldn't have been better; even though he plays similar characters in flawlessly in many other movies, this one hit the jackpot. Sharon Stone's performance is exceptional, especially during the end of the movie, I wouldn't be surprised if she really was on drugs just for the movie. Joe Pesci hits the same note as De Niro -the highest one. Like De Niro, he plays similar characters in other movies, but in this movie it fits in with the other characters and the story so obviously, it wouldn't have been the same without him, nor his character. Like all other mafia-type movies De Niro and Pesci have been in, their characters, in contrast, portray a wide spectrum of opposite attitude, feelings, and motivation that is simply entertaining to watch.In a style parallel to ""Goodfellas"" that's become the signature of Martin Scorsese, this movie might seem like just a repetitive sequel set in Las Vegas. But don't be fooled, this film is as underrated as Titanic is/was overrated, whether you judge by popularity, box office gross, or critics' ratings (or even IMDb's present user rating). Casino is a masterpiece and will not disappoint keen viewers."
"If you're ever trapped in your own house with that clueless neighbor who you wish would go home , it's good to have a copy of Casino in your DVD collection. Repeated viewing does not diminish the entertainment value of this film. At all. Maybe it's because each and every facet of the production is of the highest order. Scorsese really pulls out the stops. The three-ring storyline is engrossing. And the casting might be the best I've ever seen ,especially the Remo character who's method-acting/ non-acting helps steal every scene he's in. And Bach's St.John's Passion plays over the opening credits and an Adagio(?)at the end- I mean, this movie has everything! Did I mention this is the best gangster movie since the 1931 version of Public Enemy? Three hours is not enough but wadya gonna do?"
"After telling a friend I enjoyed The Godfather trilogy, he recommended I watch this film. And I'm sorry to say I totally regret doing so.This film is the opposite of The Godfather. It has zero emotional content. The characters are intentionally one dimensional, idiotic and therefor impossible to identify with. Most of the movie feature narration, which at first feels welcome and classic, but soon grows tiring because instead of the movie just ""happening"", the narration disrupts the acting all throughout the 3 hours.Now I know many might consider this one a classic, but I will bet you right here and now, that non of the actors playing in ""Casino"" would willingly sit through this 3 hour torture."
"I decided to give Scorsese one last chance (I'm now trying to erase the entire film from my mind, and Mr. Scorsese's name, as well). I understand he's supposed to be a great director and that the acting is supposed to be great (I just don't see it - and I tried *very* hard to see good things in this film. I paid to rent it, I wanted to like it. How can someone ruin a movie about my favorite themes - Vegas and the mob? I mean, I'll watch practically anything about this topic.This movie's pacing is arbitrary and amateurish. Scorsese knows he has to provide some gruesome violence at some point - we were checking the time of this flick at 1 hour, wondering when it would *ever* be over. I figured then that the violence would be immediate, gratuitous and upcoming - merely because it had to be there, to keep anyone watching. So there it was. A TV-style shoot-out, followed by torture scene (don't worry, I'm not spoiling much) that's filmed with overly artsy and arbitrary camera angles. I've never seen a film that relied so heavily on narration. What was Scorsese thinking? That he'd get remembered for having the most over-narrated film in world history? There are TWO overly wordy narrators, but you can't make up for the lack of cinematic action and believability on the screen - unless you are watching this during a cocktail party or something. Or you really like movies that don't require a strong plot, and blast you occasionally with set decor or violence.The sets are great - that's what kept me going through the movie, but set design and production design do not a great film make. He should have DeNiro be naked to provide interest, though. DeNiro does his obligatory pug-dog face, with the wrinkled forehead way too much, and that bobbing and swaying thing where he crosses his arms and looks intense way too much.The side characters are overwrought and stupidly dressed (that huge bolo turquoise guy is an example). Once again, Scorsese is like a cartoonist that hates cartoons. He can't even put meaningful props around the set, they appear to be symbolic (but apparently are not) and he shows us all kinds of things that never come into play (that's just bad directing - very B movie, actually). I guess I can see how a movie like this one (cartoony) can be popular, though - I just can't handle the shifts in tone and pacing throughout the flick. There are too many scenes where the frame is tilted, comic book style, that have NO comic book content - and where in addition the acting and dialog are overshadowed by set decor or costume - and the dialog/events do not move the movie forward. Why do that? And why then force so much narration (in a boring tone, mostly from DeNiro) onto the audience? I love B movies, and was prepared to view this entry as Scorsese's attempt to make one, to forgive him all the other directorial excesses he's been guilty of. If he had done that - at all, I would have liked it. Or if we'd seen naked Sharon Stone (that's how bad this was - I was praying for Sharon to lose her panties in that one scene, or at least give DeNiro a blow job, but no - nothing).The Italian mobsters and their food look fake and last minutey - as though someone composed those scenes on a Sunday morning, with a hangover, using the most obvious and basic film student style composition techniques and set pieces. Even the decor failed at many points - and it didn't have to.Oh, and by the way, Martin, if you're reading (which I doubt - if I had made this film, I'd never read anything critical about it, I'd never want to remember I'd made it) - merely sticking old slot machines in little trios on the floor here and there to denote ""basement"" doesn't work. Neither does using geometric window patterns or Renaissance colors to provide visual distraction to make plot elements loom large when in fact, it's just standard stuff. Watch a Tarantino movie, will ya?"
"Enough rehash already! Although not a remake in the traditional sense, ""Casino"" is a virtual re-presentation of Martin Scorcese's '91 smash ""Goodfellas"". Now that was a great gangster film. Graphically violent, self absorbed, bitingly funny, brooding and epically proportioned, it was a knockout. Not so ""Casino"".This is a real exercise in excess, and one that completely backfires on Scorcese and his team. The film is terribly overlong at three hours, and many will struggle to pay attention the entire time, especially given the narrative which has leads De Niro, Pesci and others talking us through the whole show, another big miscalculation.The movie is far too violent, being often hard to stomach rather than effectively portraying the characters and their personalities and motivations. It's just one long, drawn out gangster show set in Las Vegas that is spotted with bursts of gruesome violence. In short, Scorcese and co-writer Pileggi have used exactly the same formula that they employed in adapting the latter's first book ""Wise Guys"" (""Goodfellas"") to the screen, which made that film a sensation, and this one a mindless bore.Performances are strong, especially Sharon Stone as the hopeless drug fiend Ginger whose love of money proves her undoing. She is well deserving of the Oscar nomination that has come her way. De Niro and Joe Pesci, though impressive, are really only reprising their original ""Goodfellas"" turns. De Niro's Jimmy 'the Gent' Conway is very similar to his Sam Rothstein, the Jewish gambling icon who ran ""The Tangiers"" for the mob. And Pesci's Nicky Santoro, the ultra-violent, crazy mob guy assigned to look after Rothstein, is a dead ringer for Tommy De Vito, his violent, paranoid persona from ""Goodfellas"". Other support players make the most of their limited roles.Definitely under edited, tale could have been told in less than two hours, but Scorcese had to over indulge didn't he. Robert Richardson's camera work is impressive, though even he seems to be trying too hard. Perhaps that's just the whole feel of the movie. An over-rated, over the top, over inflated waste. Art and sets are incredibly lavish, while the costumes are wild but spot on. PS I bet Pileggi's book is great reading.Sunday, March 24, 1996 - Knox District Centre"
"Two people whose movies I try to avoid are Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone; Pesci is a one trick pony with a very tired act, and SS just nauseates me. So, clearly, I held off seeing Casino for many years. The other day it was at Half Price for a dollar so I picked it up. I always enjoy stories about Vegas; it's fun to peek behind the scenes of the casinos. This was one of the last good roles DeNiro had, before he descended into the Valhalla of romantic comedies with the likes of Ben Stiller. The good is simply the story itself, which is essentially true. (It is certainly NOT true that the mob was not skimming in Vegas until the 1970's). DeNiro was good, especially when he tried to deal with an old friend who he realized and always knew was an out of control idiot. DeN was clearly ready to jettison Pesci if that was what it took to keep the casino running, but was afraid he could not do so because Pesci was a made man and DeNiro, a Jew, was not and never could be. The scenes ""back East"" with the big boys were always well done; good supporting jobs by all involved. Don Rickles was good. The bad, aside from Pesci and Stone, were: the soundtrack; I felt it got in the way because it was continuous, too loud, and often at odds with the tone of what was showing on the screen. The lighting; in many scenes Scorsese put a hot spotlight on a character or a desktop. I just can't figure out what he was trying to do. The running narration was not needed after the first few scenes. All in all, I'd recommend it. Get a bottle of pure strength ammonia to sniff whenever Stone appears on the screen and you will be OK."
"Martin Scorsese's Casino is in my opinion one of the best movies of the 90s. Every character in this movie is believable because of the great performances of the actors. Especially Stone's performance as the con-artist trophy wife is truly memorable.Scorsese never fails to amaze me. From Mean Streets to Goodfellas I loved every one of his movies. His movies are usually dark and gritty pieces but in Casino I experienced a new side of Scorsese. This movie has a big epic feeling to it unlike other of his movies. And it works so well. The film is very beautiful to watch because of the great cinematography and score. Scorsese seems to have an ability to make movies with very different kind of looks. And in this movie, I think he mixed his directing techniques of Age Of Innocence and Goodfellas. Like Age Of Innocence, it has a clean look, but the characters and dialog reminded me of Goodfellas (maybe also because of the topic of this movie).Like all the Scorsese movies, this one is also a great character driven, sometimes dark and tragic, sometimes wild and brutal piece of cinema art. Each character of this movie is well developed and deep. The movie is 3 hours long, but it had me hooked from the (great) starting scene up till the very ending shot.Must see movie"
"This movie could have been a very interesting drama about Las Vegas gangsters, but Martin Scorsese ruins it with the film-making technique he used in ""Goodfellas"": expository narration. It was annoying in ""Goodfellas,"" but is very heavily used here. Instead of letting the action guide the plot, he has characters give background narration for every single point of action in the damned film. You're TOLD rather than SHOWN what happened. If I wanted to be told something, I'd read a book. Movies a re more interesting when character dialogue and action move the plot. Narration slows the movie down to a grinding halt.Oh, and there's ""Casino's"" claim to fame: the most uses of the ""F"" word in an English-language non-documentary film. Every other word is ""F"" this and ""F"" that. I know gangsters are tough, macho men who love to speak dirty, but this is way too much. Again, this is where action may have helped to convey the characterization of tough gangsters, rather than the ""F"" word every second. This film needed better dialogue. ""The Godfather"" has excellent dialogue, and though there are dirty words, it's balanced out by intelligent writing. ""Casino"" doesn't have going for it in terms of good writing, unless it's to show that the Vegas mob was run by a bunch of unintelligent morons who can't form a complete sentence without the ""F"" word.The acting is extreme and over-the-top. Sharon Stone is less than spectacular as a drug-addled, high-strung moll. She's either laughing or screaming, and nothing more. She chews the scenery like a starving pit bull. De Niro does little but blend into the background. Joe Pesci seems like his SNL caricature, screaming and squeezing heads into vices.Granted, I'm interested in the history of the Las Vegas mob, and this movie is based on a nonfiction book; but the writing was bad, and the narration device distracted from my enjoyment of the action. I didn't like ""Goodfellas,"" but it was leaps and bounds superior to this dreck. I do not recommend this, except maybe for a rental. Watch the DVD extras that feature an A&E documentary on the real Las Vegas mafia."
"While I realize this is based (inspired?) (adapted?) from a true story, nonetheless the main characters are truly disgusting people. I find absolutely nothing redeeming in any of them. This makes the film itself quite difficult to endure.I think a documentary on the history of the Las Vegas casinos would be far more interesting than watching these people commit unspeakable acts of cruelty in the name of greed. I know there's suppose to be a social message in here somewhere, but its somehow lost in all the screaming and horrible beatings we have to witness along the way. The plot line of the unhealthy relationship between Sharon Stone's character and DeNiro's grows tiresome very quickly and I found myself wanting this film to be over with much much sooner. The one good thing I can say about it is that it makes me want to never visit Las Vegas again."
"Scorsese, De Niro and Pesci team up again for a GoodFellas rehash. Casino is not a bad film. But it pales in comparison to what has come before it. It would be much easier to applaud Casino if we could take it on its own merits. But the parallels to GoodFellas are so numerous and so obvious, Casino always leaves us wanting more. We've seen this all before and we've seen it done better.Casino starts quite literally with a bang with a rather shocking car bombing before the opening titles have even rolled. It's a fascinating and highly intriguing opening but Casino never is able to sustain that energy. The film slogs along for three hours with the pace so slow that at times the movie seems to come to a dead stop. Scorsese has, even in his most brilliant successes, been criticized for the pacing (or lack thereof) in his films. Casino is a prime example of a Scorsese film that would have benefited greatly if the action could have been pushed along just a little bit faster. There's a terrific story here, top-notch acting performances and the typically brilliant Scorsese visual touches. What's missing is the energy a film like GoodFellas had. For all that Casino has going for it, in the end it's simply not entertaining enough.After the shock of the opening sequence, Casino goes back in time ten years to tell the story of Ace Rothstein, as played by Robert De Niro. We see he is running, on behalf of Midwestern mob bosses, the Tangiers casino in Las Vegas. Through use of voice-over narration (a la Goodfellas) Rothstein, and later Joe Pesci's Nicky Santoro, explain how the money moves through the casino and into the hands of the mafia kingpins. As the story begins everybody's getting paid, everything's running smoothly, everybody's happy. When mafia tough guy Santoro, played wonderfully by Pesci who could do this type of thing in his sleep, takes up residence in Vegas things start to unravel. Santoro's a hothead, out to make a quick buck for himself. Where Rothstein had been free to operate his casino in peace, when Santoro starts stirring things up he brings unwanted attention from the authorities. Rothstein's wife, Ginger, is not helping matters by being constantly drunk, stoned or drunk and stoned. Sharon Stone plays Ginger and the character is such a train wreck it's hard to really evaluate Stone's performance. She's certainly convincing as a glamorous call girl early on, perhaps less convincing when she's forced to be hysterically screaming all the time.Anyhow, Ace ends up having problems with the wife, problems with the authorities and problems with his onetime good friend Nicky. It's fascinating to see all the conflict swirl around him and De Niro is reliably brilliant in his performance as he deals with all the madness around him. Pesci is terrific and Stone is OK. Actors playing smaller roles also do noteworthy work. James Woods does well in a bit part as a man who is part of Ginger's past. Frank Vincent (GoodFellas parallel number 8,362 or thereabouts) settles into his mobster's role quite easily. And Don Rickles and Dick Smothers of all people have serious parts to play and each does a fine job. So, the acting certainly isn't the problem. The main characters, and some of the secondary ones, are wonderfully developed. Casino is beautifully photographed as you would expect from Scorsese. And the story is a good one, intriguing from beginning to end. It's in that long journey from beginning to end where Casino stumbles somewhat. It just takes too long to get where we're going and the film can't sustain the energy it opened with. A fascinating story, but in the end one that with a better pace could have been told in a much more entertaining way."
"I see people always compare this movie to goodfellas, but for me it is far better than goodfellas. It is 10 out of 10 for me. A must watch."
