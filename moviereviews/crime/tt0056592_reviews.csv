"The first time I saw To Kill A Mockingbird was at a drive-in theater.  I was probably about ten or eleven at the time.  Even at a young age I was captivated by this seemingly simple story told through the eyes of children that I could easily relate to.  Perhaps also it was the fact that the part of the story that dealt with Boo Radley, held a kind of mystery and an eeriness for me, much in the way a ghost story would.  I'm not about to make the pretense that I understood the social significance of To Kill A Mockingbird at the age of ten, or even the greatness of the film.  That would come later in life, after having viewed it in one of it's first network television broadcasts.One of the things that makes To Kill A Mockingbird a truly great film is the love and respect everyone involved in bringing Harper Lee's novel to the screen had for the original source material.  It shows up on screen in every single frame.  Each performance in this film is beyond reproach.  Gregory Peck had many fine performances over his storied career, but none every approached the perfection he brought to his portrayal of Atticus Finch.  As Atticus, Peck brings us the depth of understanding as to how his love for Jem and Scout enables him to treat his children with respect and honesty. He never talks down to them, but approaches them on a level in which children of their age can comprehend and learn from his own wisdom.  Yet, he is still able to retain the same no nonsense approach as other parents. Atticus is also a man who believes in the integrity of justice, yet recognizes the failings of our justice system.  When called upon to do his duty, he does so, despite the hatred and venom brought to bear upon him and his children by the citizens of the town in which he lives.In casting Jem, Scout and Dill, Producer Alan J. Pakula and Director Robert Mulligan faced a daunting task.  So much of the success of To Kill A Mockingbird depended on the pivotal role these characters would play in the film.  For Jem he chose Philip Alford, for Scout, Mary Badham, and for Dill, John Megna.  Alford and Badham were both southern natives who had never been in films before.  Megna was a New York native but was also inexperienced. It is this inexperience and lack of polish that enables all three to shine on the screen.  Mulligan began filming by letting them act as if making a film was like recess, allowing them to play on the set, and only moving the camera gradually as they became accustomed to their surroundings.  It paid off in every way imaginable.  None of the three ever appear as if they are actors acting, and bring a childlike wonder and presence to their roles that I had never seen before, and will unlikely witness again.Brock Peters as Tom Robinson, the black man falsely accused of raping a white girl, also gives a performance which he would never again surpass. You will not find anywhere a more memorable scene in any court room than when he testifies on the witness stand.  Because he dared to care about a white girl, he now faces almost certain death if convicted, and perhaps even if not convicted.  It is the first time I was able to begin to understand the effects of man's prejudice and hatred of a man simply because of the color of his skin.  Just as Jem and Scout came of age, and realized the significance of the injustices of racial hatred, so did I.Equally significant, is Collin Wilcox as Mayella Ewell. She makes it easy for many to hate her, but like Atticus, we see in her a person to be more pitied than hated.  She is a product of not only the times in which she lives, but even more so of her wretched upbringing.  Mayella is what she is, but only because of the deep cutting prejudices of those around her.  To Mayella, being caught enticing a black man into your house for relations, is the ultimate crime and the penalty for doing so is unthinkable to her.
In his screen debut as Boo Radley, Robert Duvall also brings to life the mysterious neighbor that once frightened Jem, Dill, and Scout so much. Though on the screen for a short length of time, without uttering a word, Duvall shows us a man tortured by years of cruelty, mistreatment, and the gossip and whispers of neighbors.  He is a man who wants only to live in his own way, yet the bond that links him to Jem and Scout is significant.  They are the childhood he had never really known.  Just as Tom Robinson, he has never brought harm to anyone, yet suffers significantly just for the right to be able to exist.The care with which To Kill A Mockingbird was brought to the screen can also be seen in the Art Direction by Henry Bumstead and Set Decoration by Oliver Emert.  They indeed bring to life what a small Southern Town would have been like in the early thirties. Cinematographer Russel Harlan's black and white photography brings it all vividly to the screen, especially in the way he captures the foreboding of the Radley house, the moments when Bob Ewell approaches Jem when he is left in a car alone, and even more noteworthy near the end of the film when Jem and Scout are walking home from a school play. Elmer Bernstein's score is never boisterous, but yet is as important to setting the mood of many of the scenes played out before us.There have been many eloquent words written in many of the comments on this board about To Kill A Mockingbird. Many of the words are far better than those that I have written.  Then again, maybe a few simple paragraphs cannot truly describe the significant achievement in film making that To Kill A Mockingbird is.  It will be forever remembered, long after you and I have departed from this world.  It is at this point that I usually grade a film. I will skip that here, simply because there is no grade that I can give that could possibly do justice for To Kill A Mockingbird."
"To Kill a Mockingbird is the movie based on the Harper Lee novel of the same name about Scout, Jem and their father, Atticus Finch who is an attorney in a small southern town.  It is both a coming of age story about the children as well as a hard-hitting drama, as Atticus defends a black man who is on trial for the rape of a white woman.  This review is not an easy one to write, despite the fact that I have seen this film at least 10 times.  The reason it does not come easily is that this is one of the most personally important films I have ever seen and is in my personal `Top Five of All Time'.  I'm certain there is nothing that can be said about the film that has not already been repeated a multitude of times, so I guess the best thing to do is explain why the film is so important to me.I first saw this film several years ago and was so profoundly affected by it that I immediately watched it again.  Of course, the defense of a man wrongly accused of a crime is a common story line, but To Kill a Mockingbird stands out as an exceptional example for several reasons.  Among them, the date that the film was released:  1962, on the cusp of the civil rights movement in America, and the fact that it takes place in the south in the 1930's.  It is also far from the first film to explore the experiences of children and their own personal growth, but To Kill a Mockingbird stands out because of its sheer honesty and natural performances by the child actors portraying these rich characters.  But most of all, this film is special because of Gregory Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch, a true hero.  At the risk of sounding histrionic, my heart aches when I watch him on screen because he is such an incredible man, and is so inherently good.  No matter how many times I have seen this film, I smile when I see his interaction with his children, and I well with tears when I see his incredible strength of character.  (No easy feat to break through the armor of this cynical film geek who, if given the chance would remake at least a few dozen films with tragic endings.) I was sitting in my car listening to National Public Radio recently the day Gregory Peck died, and I'm not ashamed to admit that I sat and cried hearing the retrospective they offered  mainly because the man who portrayed my own personal cinematic hero was gone, but also because Peck lived his life with the same conviction as his best known role; a fact that makes Atticus Finch all the more tangible.  The American Film Institute recently named Atticus Finch the number one hero of all time, a choice I consider both brave and insightful in an age where our heroes generally either wield weapons or have super human physical strength.  Atticus Finch fights evil as well, but with his strong moral fiber and his mind.  To Kill a Mockingbird is generally required reading during the course of one's education.  If you have not read it, do so.  If you have not seen the film, do so; and share it with others.  It is an exceptional film that stands the test of time and will remain an important addition to film history for as long as the genre exists.  --Shelly"
"TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is presented like a play in three acts. It is also from the children's perspective. Through the kids, we find that racism is a learned attitude or feeling. We also see a delightful coming of age drama as the young kids realize that there is no Boogeyman down the street and their father is capable of doing a lot more than they think. The great Gregory Peck plays Atticus Finch, a pillar of nobility, social conscience, and, rare for 1930's Americana, a single parent. Peck is such a strong presence, you believe everything about him. It is something you can compare to America's trust in TV anchorman Walter Cronkite. We always took his word for it.Act one puts Atticus in the background and allows the kids to flourish. Director Robert Mulligan was able to get such realistic performances from non-professional kids. They are amusing and fun to watch. The big mystery lies in the house down the street in this small Georgia town. Who is the monstrous, ""6 and a half feet big"" legend living in the end house? Some light suspense ensues, while the buildup to a stirring act two is happening. Atticus must defend an African-American man for the alleged rape of a white woman.After threats galore, an unshaken Peck takes to the courtroom jungle in, without a doubt, one of the top 5 court scenes in motion picture history. Brock Peters lends the film its best moments as the accused ""negro"" on trial. This man has a face chiseled with suffering and deep, deep sorrow. We know Atticus is a good man, a decent human being with a soul. He sees this in his client as well, and in a closing argument that must have roused the civil rights movement, implores the jury to vote justice. An all-male, all-white jury in the 1930's were tough listeners. Peters' breakdown on the stand is one of the most realistic, emotionally saddening moments you'll ever see, especially in Hollywood films of the 1960's. The scene when Peck leaves the courtroom is now legendary as well.Act three produces a tragic death, an unlikely hero, and the bringing together of a family. The filmmakers have such a passion for the material, they seem to handle it with gentleness. Racism is a hard-boiled subject and it is depicted and dealt with through grace and patience. TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD poses the injustice of race relations in the 1930's as a front for the events happening in the 1960's. The film came out during turbulent times and was also an adaption of a literary classic. I am one to judge a film solely by film only. The book is a separate art form and should not be compared to the film, an art form itself. It is important, it is enlightening, and it has not aged. Watch it.RATING: 9 of 10"
"After hearing nothing but critical acclaim for this film, and the book it was based on, I finally got to see it. I am quite amazed at how well done this film is, and how timeless the theme is. I haven't read the book, but I'm considering it, just to see if there are any details that were left out. The story is amazing and exceptionally told. As far as I know, the film is as close to the book as it could possibly be; some call it the most accurate book-to-film conversion ever. The plot is very good, it takes a timeless problem and presents it to us, through the innocent eyes of a naive child. The pace is very good; apart from The Godfather(the first one) and one or two other exceptions, this is the only drama where there was truly not one single moment that I found dull, boring or unimportant. Nothing seemed trivial in the film. The perspective that is forced upon us is that of a young child, naive and innocent. This is a brilliant idea, as the eyes of a child is without a doubt one of the most impressionable things in the world, and the film handles this perfectly. What really makes the film, apart from the brilliant and possibly unique perspective, is the fact that the children are likable, credible and charming. You couldn't help but like them; believe me, normally I really dislike children. I find them annoying, loud and egotistical. But with this film, I couldn't, for one second, muster up any tiny amount of aggression, or even annoyance. They come off as so likable, charming, and, most importantly, *real*. Almost every kid in any Hollywood movie is either a completely ridiculous stereotype/cliché of a brat, who does nothing but destroy things around him, or the exact opposite, a little angel. Everyone knows that no child is the latter all the time, and even I will admit that there probably doesn't exist too many children who are the first, either. In this film, the children are completely real. They are naive, innocent, they disobey what their father tells them, but ultimately, they obviously love and respect their father, and they never do anything, anything at all, with the intent to hurt or harm someone or something. That is what a child is; innocent. They do what they do because they do not know better. This film provides a perfect view into their world, or, rather, their perspective of it. The acting is excellent. The child actors exceed all expectations. I was amazed at how professional and convincing they were. The other actors all give great performances as well. The cinematography is excellent; once again, it gives a perfect perspective on what your surroundings look like when you're a child. The characters are well-written, credible and well-casted. The dialog was well-written. The script was excellent. A very memorable and beautiful film, should be viewed by almost anyone. I recommend this to anyone who likes dramas, and just about anyone who for one reason or another might enjoy this. Don't be scared off by it being over forty years old, or it being black and white; it's an excellent film, and just about anyone would enjoy it. Don't miss this perfect film. 10/10"
"Hoo boy, am I a sucker for courtroom dramas. The wrangling of legal points and the investigation into the truth just gets my cinematic blood pumping (I s'pose it's in response to my own dashed hopes of becoming an attorney).""To Kill a Mockingbird"" rises to the top of the pile easily.Yes, the courtroom proceedings are nail-bitingly engaging. But played out against the tapestry of bigotry and hate make the legal goings-on even more compelling.The writing here is so beautiful, so lyric, so poetic. The Harper Lee-based screenplay captures wonderfully a time and a place that are absolutely real--where big brothers could solve the universe's problems in an instant and all the treasures of the world could be contained in a cigar box.""To Kill a Mockingbird"" also contains three of the most impressive child performances I have ever witnessed--there's not a false or affected moment in any one of them. Until seeing ""Ponette,"" a movie I would highly recommend, the kids in ""Mockingbird"" received my best child performance ever awards. ""Ponette"" has ratcheted them down one notch, but that doesn't diminish the achievement here. The scene in which Scout dispels the mob simply by identifying its individual members is one of the most powerful moments in filmdom.Peck more than deserved his best actor nod. His quiet dignity is a definite asset. Brock Peters, too, is terrific in what could have been a cliched role.If you are a moviegoer who has a bias against black and white movies and who has therefore never seen ""Mockingbird,"" I pity you. You've passed on one of Hollywood's most unforgettable experiences."
"After studying the outstanding book of To Kill A Mockingbird at school, I viewed this film, and was on the whole very impressed. Scout and Jem are portrayed brilliantly, considering the ages of the children who played them, and they, as with everything else in the production, are true to the book's spirit. Gregory Peck is perfect as the unflappable Atticus Finch, and deserved his Oscar. The music is worthy of praise, especially for the climatic scene, and the raw emotion and feeling of the book is amply conveyed. All of the cast are well cast, and it's interesting to ponder how much this film, at the time, would've shocked. That the book explores racism and outsiders in a southern town, through the eyes of a child is genius and works very nicely here. The only problems are minor- much of the book's counter-balancing humour was left out, certain characters are omitted (Dolphus Raymond and Aunt Alexandra), and some of the book's early characterisation is missed. Aside from these gripes, this is a magical film and a ""must-see,"" as a companion piece to the classic novel. 9/10"
"Enough good things can't be said about this movie.  It is undoubtedly one of the best and most moving films ever made.  No other racial injustice or discriminatory based movie can even compare with ""To Kill a Mockingbird"". This movie not only makes you sympathize with those who were being discriminated against, but also those who fought for those people.  One of the most moving parts of the movie is when Atticus Finch is leaving the court room and Reverend Sykes tells Scout to ""stand up your father is passing"".Gregory Peck has always been one of my favorite actors.  This is definitely one of my favorite roles that he has ever played, and he does an excellent job at it.  Mary Badham and Philip Alford are excellent as Jem and Scout. Mary Badham became the youngest girl to receive an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actress for her role as Scout.  Although it had a short time on screen, Robert Duvall's portrayal of ""Boo"" Radley was one of his very first roles on screen and what better movie than ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" to kick off your acting career.A great movie of all times."
"This is why I watch movies. Every once in a while I stumble upon such a masterpiece which moves me to tears, because it reminds me that, all bad things aside, there is good in all of us - we just have to help each other search for it and bring it to light.This is definitely one of the best films I've ever seen. Mary Badham is absolutely wonderful as 'Scout', and I think she deserves just as much credit as Gregory Peck for this picture.The rest of the cast are great as well, and a special mention goes to Elmer Bernstein for his delicate and so appropriate score.I love this movie and recommend it to anyone. 10/10"
"'To Kill a Mockingbird' is one of the best books ever written but this film does it justice. The performances throughout are stunning, especially that of Gregory Peck (Harper Lee was so impressed she gave him her late father's pocket watch, a prop he uses in the film, to keep). This film will make anyone think hard about how they treat others and it is really heartwarming without being soppy. It isn't necessary to have read the book before seeing this film but it might be advisable. This is one of the classic films of its generation and very few films of nowadays come close to matching it either. A real must-see."
"Very rarely, it happens that movies are made that are very simple in expression but possess monumental appeals and significant life lessons in a style only of the kind of their own that, we can't expect even. This fact is truthfully exemplified in this movie. It's not just a movie or even just a promising story in general, but all it portray's is ""Innocence"". A girl's recollection of her childhood days which are still at their full bloom in her mind, depicting the innocence of juvenile as well as as adult minds, a period where mostly immature minds become curious to the racial bigotry and sometimes mature minds become its prey and a time when harsh realities of life like intolerance, hatreds, prejudice and adversities of society gradually dawn upon them.Atticus Finch ( Gregory Peck ) is an absolutely Gentleman Lawyer whose wife has passed away and he has a son and a daughter. A Black man Tom Robinson is wrongly alleged of raping a poor white woman. In fact, he a victim of white woman's effort to hide her guilt by targeting his innocence and utilizing favors of racial attitude of unsocial society towards Negros. Finch decides to defend him on his principles realizing that the narrow minded society will turn against him and so it happened and townspeople started making his life agonizing. The whole story is masterfully out shined by the ingenuousness, purity and innocence of his children with with a unique inspirational interaction with their father.Boo Readly who lives in the town is mentally retarded and is sidelined by the society. He is a mark of fear and curiosity for children because he is different from others. But he is the one who marks the ultimate climax of this emotionally crafted masterpiece.It's a must see movie for all ages in all times because it gives many priceless emotional and touching lessons for those who are sincere and perceptive.A Remarkably Simple and Simply Remarkanble Masterpiece!!!"
"Horton Foote's Oscar-winning screenplay is so good, it really supplants the 1960 Harper Lee book. I've recently re-read the novel, and it seemed weighed down and paced with backwoods vernacular and situations right out of the 1930s, that are shockingly removed from the 21st century. My goodness. I hope it doesn't strike others so, because the book is a gem too. It's just in need of ...updating perhaps, which is what the 1962 movie excels at; it translates the Depression Era for us. The characters (played, eg by Gregory Peck and Brock Peters in their signature roles) seem so much better-depicted on screen than merely in my own imagination from having read the book!
Only Arthur/'Boo' Radley (a peroxided Robert Duvall) seems at first a jarring casting choice to me; but in the end all seem terrific.Now THESE child actors, Mary Badham ('Scout'), Philip Alford ('Jem'), and John Megna (as 'Dill'), should've won Oscars. I'm sure they're all better than Haley Joel Osment, who strikes me as 'studied'. These kids are just natural, completely oblivious of the camera. Unbelievable. Actually, I wonder what genius DID do the casting, because the film gives no casting credit. I guess in 1962 the CSA didn't exist yet... That casting director deserves an Oscar too.This is what great filmmaking is all about; when several areas of perfection are jointly present a film that reaches into your heart and yanks you up and down. Those were real acting jobs, not the cretinous drivel passing for 'work' these days. The reason we don't see too many better movies than Das Experiment is because post-modernism has long encamped in Hollywood (it set up a Starbuck's years ago).The first scene instantly captures Scout's world. She's learning fast at the shoulder of her loving widower lawyer father that she shouldn't embarrass people who are even poorer than they are; and Jem is tantrumming up a tree because he can't brag about his dad's non-existent cool to his friends. Jem demands Atticus play football(!) for the Mets, or more uproariously as Scout tells it, for `the Methodists', hahahaha. (Can we picture Methodists in a sackrace? How many Methodists does it take to change a lightbulb?)The Boo Radley story arc is much better paced in the movie than the book; but because I want to focus on the race-relations arc, I will only make passing comment on Boo: he is gently painted in both the book and movie as another previously dismissed but highly virtuous person, who deserves to be analogized with the fragile, hopeful beauty of the mockingbird.
The harrowing exploration of entrenched injustice through various acts of racist violence are adult themes that really couldn't be explored well in a book constrained by the first person narrative of a 7-yr-old little girl. The movie is able to show the Tom Robinson court case much more objectively. Robert Mulligan's direction quickly telegraphs Bob Ewell's shifty creepiness with the scene of his slovenly leering at Atticus' children in the car. Collin Wilcox is also heartrending as Mayella, the ignorant, uneducated and abused daughter of Bob Ewell. Inexplicably, Gregory Peck's cross-examination scene is not quite as sensitive as Atticus is in the book; Peck never reveals that flash of pain at having to destroy Mayella's false testimony.
Little Scout's key scene, where she embarrasses the lynch mob (collectively no better than Tom Ewell alone) just with her amiable child's chatter, is EVERY BIT as powerful and stressful as in the book. Probably more, because body language is a much better form of expression for a scene like this.Brock Peters' Tom Robinson is the archetypal decent black man who, YES, felt sorry for a brutalized white woman, as we all ought to. Don't bother debating `what if he was guilty', because TKAM is not a whodunnit; it's an expose of what used to happen WHEN a black man was innocent. The heartbreaking destruction of Tom Robinson's proverbial mockingbird is our collective shame, even now, because similar dismissive laziness still happens. It's every person's character that matters, not whether they're `Methodists'.We do construct our identities as part of various groups. But no group membership, or belief about it, makes any person categorically virtuous. That still hinges on a person's strengths, and crucially, their weaknesses. A person's bad character will overwhelm whatever beliefs they hold; their good character will enhance them. We are all free to act better, or worse, than our beliefs; we're NOT powerless over them, so no-one should ever die over a belief. Cooler thinking than mere violence must rule, or else objective justice will never materialize. And it's only justice if the judgement is accurate; but accuracy requires the abolition of the sort of intellectual/societal laziness that regularly befalls the weakest subgroups of society. Well, we all saw the intellectual rigour of that lynch mob. Would you trust them to tell the time? You might not feel happy trusting even the sheriff (Frank Overton), testifying in court but no better than a hick himself: `Oh, I guess that would make it her LEFT'. Those powerful imbeciles stood in judgement over some societally fragile people, like Tom, and yes, like Mayella.It's still powerful how Tom's hammering as sarcastic legal argument by the prosecutor (William Windom) served to bring home Tom's societal fragility; and we're humbled at the quiet dignity of the entire black population who soberingly stood in the rafters to honor Atticus' failed attempt. The movie was made in 1961, some 7 years before the martyrdom of Martin Luther King Jr, yet in the light of recent gang-related violence, it's clear there are still many who think their group belonging excuses/masks their brutality as people. It does not. And the brutality came first.This movie needs to be seen by the young, to open their hearts to humanity, and their standards for their own personal character, for the rest of their lives. 10/10."
"I'm surprised that there aren't more comments on Peck's amazing depiction of Atticus Finch, the father. In this era of absent fathers, preoccupied fathers, abusive fathers, immature fathers, etc, etc, Peck's Finch gives us all a soothing view of the best of fatherhood. Where else do we get to watch a man sit up with his ill child, stand firm in his convictions, show patience and gentleness with his children, demonstrate an appropriate level of humility, communicate righteous values to his children, and give his children a picture of integrity to emulate. Every time I view this film I wonder how Peck was able to pull this off. Every time I view this film, it gives me hope for the future of fatherhood."
"""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is truly a much loved and critically-acclaimed film. It is a perfect portrayal of childhood innocence, racial prejudice, moral tolerance and courage. No other words can describe this film except marvellous. The film is so wonderfully done that the audience actually feels as if they were in Alabama during the 1930s. This is a must see for anyone of any age."
"When the American Film Institute polled its members and they selected Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch as the greatest hero on film ever, the selection was met with very few dissenters. I'm sure not going to argue the merits of the choice. But I do have a theory as to why.Gregory Peck for the most part played decent honorable thinking men in his films. A few films like Duel in the Sun and The Boys from Brazil have him as a villain, but the public never accepted him really in those parts.Few of us in our lives can be Horatio Hornblower or spike the Guns of Navarone or command a submarine as in On the Beach. But Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird is well within our grasp. He's a small town lawyer, raising his children as a single parent and most of all trying to lead them by example. The performances of Mary Badham and Philip Alford show the kids have learned it very well as does the uncredited narration of Kim Stanley as the grown-up Scout.Atticus Finch is a very attainable ideal. It is I believe the secret of the popularity of both the book and the film. To Kill a Mockingbird is the story of Atticus Finch and his family during the Thirties in rural Alabama. The action takes place over several months of a given year. The most important part of the film deals with Finch defending a black man for allegedly raping a white woman. It's a thankless task and Finch knows it, because he knows the attitudes of the people there, those who would make up an all white jury. Still he proceeds with courage and determination. His summation to the jury is a film classic and Peck's innate decency is nicely counterbalanced by William Windom's prosecutor who smirks through out the trial knowing he just has to play the race card to win.Other outstanding performances are Brock Peters as the man Peck is defending, James Anderson as the father of the girl he's accused of violating, and Frank Overton as the county sheriff.This film was the debut of Robert Duvall in the part of Boo Radley who plays the autistic neighbor of the Finches. No dialog at all for Duvall who conveys great and pained emotion with a series of expressions that are unforgettable. Duvall played a similar role in another Peck film, Captain Newman, MD.Gregory Peck got the Best Actor Award for 1962. He was up against some very stiff competition that year. Peck beat out Jack Lemmon for Days of Wine and Roses, Burt Lancaster for Birdman of Alcatraz, Peter O'Toole for Lawrence of Arabia and Marcello Mastroianni for Divorce Italian style. No doubt sentiment did play a part in the final award. Lemmon and Lancaster had already gotten Oscars and O'Toole and Mastroianni were relative newcomers. But I sure think the Academy selection that year has stood the test of time.This film has sure stood the same test."
"About ten years ago, a year or so after I was married, I became quite ill and was bed-ridden for almost two weeks. I was in so much pain I could not sit on the sofa and look at television; my eyes hurt so badly from my fever that I couldn't even lie in bed and read. It was Christmas season and my husband, working in retail, worked extra long hours. With no way to entertain myself or even to sleep, the long hours spent alone were almost unbearable. Then I had an idea: I had seen that our public library had books on tape. I asked my husband if he would find something interesting for me, not having any idea what sort of ""books"" they might have. He chose To Kill a Mockingbird.I had, of course, always heard of the book but apparently it was not on our required reading list in high school. Remembering how I had loathed so many of the books I was forced to read in school, I had mixed feelings when he brought it to me. Still, I welcomed ANY distraction to help pass the time. What an absolutely wonderful book it turned out to be. (If my memory is correct, it was read by Meryl Streep. What a beautiful job she did of it!) Looking back at it now, I'm glad I got so sick that winter, or I might not have had the opportunity to ""read"" it. What a comfort it was to me during a painful, difficult time.A few years later I ran across the movie on television. I was so very pleased to see how well they translated it to film. No film ever captures EVERY facet of a book (or we'd have an awful lot of eight hour films out there!) but the book was definitely given justice. Having grown up in the deep south myself, even having myself attended segregated school and seen INTENSE prejudice amongst the privileged white upper-class, I applaud the book's writer and the film's producer all the more for producing such works during a time of indescribable social struggle and upheaval.To Kill a Mockingbird is a strong, quiet film of great dignity... qualities that are sadly lacking in almost every film made in this country today. To me though, having first come across the book in the isolation of of sickness, listening to it hour after hour in the dim light of my bedroom, watching the grey winter clouds pass by the window as I listened, it will alway be my own special, personal film."
"I first saw this movie, and read Harper Lee's prize-winning novel, when I was in High School. And the subject matter has stood the test of time...'To Kill a Mockingbird' would have to be one of the classic on-screen court-room dramas and Gregory Peck once said that his award-winning portrayal of Atticus Finch, a small-town lawyer during the Depression, was his crowning achievement as an actor.The other character dominating the movie is 'Scout', Atticus' school-age daughter, who seems like she would rather be a boy at times. Her adult character (never seen on screen) acts as a narrator, quietly reflecting on and interpreting some of what we see.'Jem' is Scout's older brother. Jem and Scout's mother had passed away previously and there is a touching scene early in the film where the children quietly remember their mother and are overheard by Atticus. At the same time Sheriff Tate arrives to offer Atticus the most difficult case of his career -- that of Tom Robinson.Tom is an African-American and race relations in the 'Deep South' is another major theme of the film. Tom has been accused by a white woman, and will face a white judge and white jury. Some might say that the movie points to social inequalities and the fallibility of our judicial system.The movie is filmed in black and white and this seemed wholly appropriate given the subject matter and austere setting. It's a poignant movie that can be enjoyed many times over..."
"Generally, I prefer to review movies I dislike, because I am better able to quantify negative opinions than positive ones, but ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" deserves a review as few other movies I have ever seen.  I probably cannot make any statement about this film that has not already been made many times, but it really is one of the most beautiful and moving films I have ever seen.  I first read Harper Lee's lovely novel when I was a young teen, and it was one of those books that gave me an experience that changed the way I perceived the world and my own family.  The movie stays true to the wonderful, innocent prose.Every time I watch, I see my father in Atticus Finch.  He, too, is a southerner who respects people and defends his beliefs.  He also has always respected his children and treated us the way Atticus treats Scout and Jem. I also see other family and friends in various characters in the film, because we have such strong southern roots.  Even the negative aspects of racial antipathy and loss of childish innocence bring certain memories to mind.  Those who did not grow up in the south or with southern families might not see parallels the way I do, but the movie would be a gem to anyone.  Gregory Peck put in the performance of his career, and the children acted in the least forced manner I have ever seen.  The cinematography is also beautiful, and the script is perfectly balanced-not too sparse, but also not dialogue heavy.The best thing about ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is that it preserves the spirit of the novel that resounds with so many people.  This film stands as one of the best ever arguments for tolerance, loving families, and the beauty of life through a child's eyes.  Everyone who watches movies ought to see it."
"The film takes my breath away. It's a perfect drama! It is so unpretentious, profound, simple, truthful, and elegant. It is absolutely timeless. It seems to deeply move everyone who watches it. I own this movie and bawl my eyes out every time I see it. But it's a good cry. To Kill a Mockingbird (TKAM, I'll call it) both breaks my heart and inspires me, because it reminds me of human beings' capacity for decency and bravery.Has there ever been a more touching character than Atticus Finch???? Not a perfect man, not a God, but just a person who respected the rights of other people and tried to do the right thing; he was a ""decent"" man. He tried to live his life according to the saying ""do unto others as you would have them do unto you."" Such quiet dignity! I can see why Atticus Finch was recently named the #1 movie ""Hero"" of all time by the American Film Institute. Just thinking about this movie brings tears to my eyes. The only other film to affect me in such a deep way has been The Shawshank Redemption.Gregory Peck would be forever known as Atticus Finch, and he expressed how honored he felt to be associated with such a character. I saw an interesting documentary about Peck's life, and in it he was doing one-man shows around the country. These shows were question-and-answer sessions with the audience, and the majority of questions and comments were related to TKAM and how portraying Atticus Finch had impacted Peck's life. It was so interesting and touching to hear people talk about how the film and that character affected them. I remember one man standing up and saying that TKAM inspired him to become a lawyer, and that he named his son Atticus. I've read here and there about the favorite movies of various celebrities, and have been amazed that of all the movies out there in the world, there's one title that pops up frequently as a favorite - and that's TKAM. And it's the favorite of all kinds of people, both young and old. I almost fell off my chair when I read that it was Madonna's favorite movie. Didn't think she has such good taste! Anyway, how extraordinary it must have been for G. Peck, Robert Duvall and all the other people who were part of TKAM to realize that they created something really, truly impacted people - and could inspire people to try to be better human beings. Wow. Such a legacy!"
"Exiled to Pennsylvania for four years, I read this book to then later watched the film with my children because I saw it as the best gift I could possibly give them from my heritage. TKAM showed a whole generation of southerners how we might live up to our ideals and grow out of our bigotry. This is film making at its unpretentious best- unlike Kane or the Godfather, or Kurosawa, this film isn't about the director or even the actors; it is about a story whose poetry and truth have the power to change people. In that sense it renders powerful testimony to what film making can be. Cleverness and ""genius"" in making films will, at best, only rate an ""8"" from me. This film represents what I think a ""10"" rating should be about.Gregory Peck's performance fits the intent of the film perfectly- quietly dignified and accessible because of his ability to get himself out of the way. Not every book deserves or even affords film makers the luxury of making a movie that so closely reflects the feel of the book, but TKAM is one of those films that understood the book it was based on and the dream of the author who wrote it."
"Undoubtedly a classic hallmark in cinema, To Kill a Mockingbird dealt with social issues when social issues were still very much an issue in society, much more so than today although some of the same basic feelings are still present. Being younger than the film itself, I can only imagine the impact it had on people when it first came out. And seeing how the film has not been forgotten after the decades since it's release, I think it's safe to say that it had quite an effect as it continues to do so. Having read the book in high school, the film seems fairly accurate to the story except for a few very minor things that are mostly the result of a book being condensed into a much shorter journey.Gregory Peck is perfect in his role as Atticus Finch and apparently I'm not alone in that opinion as he won an Oscar for the role. All three children in the movie are also quite impressive and entirely convincing. I particularly enjoyed seeing Robert Duvall in his first film appearance as the ambiguous Boo Radley. It's very difficult to give reviews for older films, particularly ones that were made prior to my existence, mostly due to the inevitable fact that like everything else films also age, sometimes weakening the original potency. But to be honest, the only thing that I can see that has noticeably aged is the music, which is entirely understandable and is to be expected. And given the fact that it's over four decades old, that is quite a statement. It all boils down to a very important film about a very important and popular book in which social issues were dealt with and still holds relevance today. Like many classics, it's not just a movie, but a film with a message. A heart warming classic and an essential notch in the belt of film history."
"There are two highlights of this film: One is, as could be expected, Gregory Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch as the rock of his family, the law, and even the entire Maycomb County. The other is the sharp, focused direction by Robert Mulligan. Hopefully, every movie-lover has seen at least one or two films in which every single camera angle is perfectly done. This film is one of them for anyone who has seen it. The silences and long pauses (almost Ingmar Bergman-esque in their magnitude) accompanied with some of the sharpest b & w photography in American Cinema make this a film that sears its images into your brain.The story, as anyone who has read Harper Lee's novel can say, is both sentimental and powerful. The screenplay by Horton Foote is good, but only as long as it follows Lee's clearly stated boundaries.To Kill a Mockingbird is a film with a brilliant lead performance, sensible, savvy directing which, when mixed with Lee's touching, fulfilling story of American values, is not going to be forgotten for a long time after the initial viewing."
"Spoilers warningI bought the DVD for `Mockingbird' recently, remembering the courtroom scene where the defence attorney Atticua Finch (Gregory peck) throws a glass to Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) the defendant, asking him to catch it with his right hand, and then again with his left hand. After watching the DVD, I still cannot remember whether I've seen the film before. The above scene I might have seen in a trailer but I do have some vague recollection of the `scary' visits to the strange house. The strongest themes that come out of the movie would undoubtedly be racial injustice and the law enforcement system purportedly originated from Camelot. The film does not stoop to poetic justice on both counts, which puts it one notch above your usual courtroom thrillers. Do not forget though the title of the film. The mockingbird alludes not to the wronged black defendant, but a mentally disturbed young man who appears only at the very end. Most ironically, the injustice is vindicated not by the machinery of the legal system, but rather by a `crime' committed by this mentally disturbed youth. This is the most thought provoking aspect of the film.Gregory Peck won his Oscar in this film. Recently, we have witnessed more and more cases where an Oscar is won by bawling and howling on the screen, augmented by helps from the general political atmosphere, best exemplified by the year 2001. Peck won his in 1962 purely on the merit of his performance.The moving spirit of Mockingbird is in the trio of kids, brother and sister at (about) 12 and 6, plus a little guy of 7 in neighbourhood, who appears at the commencement of every summer holiday. While both guys are excellent, it's Mary Badham who stole the show playing the little girl. Of all the child stars that I have ever seen, she is the only one that does not suffer in comparison with Haley Joel Osment (`Six sense' etc). I would love to see this pair together on screen, except that they are in real life almost 40 years apart. A wild and crazy thought: could she have been his mother? One delightful final surprise, noticed only when I checked into IMDB, is that Boo, the mentally disturbed young man, was played by none other than Robert Duvall !"
"After forty-three years, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" (TKAM) remains one of the most effective testimonials to the ravages of ignorance and prejudice ever recorded on film. Asking myself why this gracefully paced narrative has left such an indelible impression on so many, I've concluded it's because the film isn't about what most of its supporters and detractors claim it's about. Not about race or prejudice? . . . No. At its core, TKAM is about ""neighbors"" and ""community"", which concept forms the basis for the gravity of its message in the matter of Tom Robinson.Other films have followed on the familiar theme of racial bigotry and its well-documented devastations. These films have been consistently less effective because we are not asked to think so much, or to connect the history depicted with the histories of our own lives and our own communities.I've performed in two stage versions of TKAM, neither of which benefited from the brilliant input of screenwriter, Horton Foote. Both plays focus, almost exclusively, on the racial element of the story. They, like so many films of later years, come off as ""heavy-handed"" or ""in-your-face"" regarding this element. Well . . . ""If you think this way -- you're bad."" End of story. In TKAM (the film), we see a community of poor, unique, and apparently respectable people helping one another through a Depression. In stark contrast (and beautifully prepared by the film's creators) the injustices meted out to Tom Robinson and his family represent a dramatic anachronism of unthinkable proportions. And, it's as routine, in this gentle Southern community, as a child's fear of a mysterious neighbor, or a shy but happy exchange of hickory nuts for legal services rendered. Memorable? Most emphatically. Think about it. It's what director Mulligan wants us to do."
"To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. This movie shows some of the problems between blacks and whites. These differences between two races make this story so special. The characters adaptation was very interesting, starting with Atticus Finch and his children. Also, I love how this story was told through the eyes of one child.In this movie were many things that make it interesting such as the characters, the theme, plot and mysterious elements. First, the main actors had a very good representation on their characters, for instance, Atticus Finch, Scout and Jem. The theme of this story was based in prejudice and was showing the differences between blacks and whites. Also, the plot was very detailed and exciting because Boo was scary and mysterious. Finally, Tom Robinson also brings to the plot the essentials of the movie.Although the movie To Kill a Mockingbird is very exciting, some things do not show the truth of the story. One of these things is when Mr. Radley cemented the tree's knothole and the children get down without knowing the cause. Also, something needing to change may be the Ewell family because they are an evil family without any feeling toward other people. The trial of Tom Robinson is conspicuous and sad because the movie itself makes him an important character. But knowing all these things, this movie is still great.To Kill a Mockingbird is a great movie where you can find one of the most recognized actors of all time, Gregory Peck. Mr. Peck stands out in all his qualities that are made by his values. One of the foremost qualities of Gregory Peck is his courage to confront the goals of his work and his personal life. Atticus Finch and Gregory Peck have a different life and feelings, but they are both moral men. Finally, both conduct themselves with dignity.In conclusion, To Kill a Mockingbird is a beautiful movie that I will like to recommend to everybody to watch. In this movie one learns about the social class, the good and evil. One thing that I really liked was to know about Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch. Also, I felt empathy with many situations in the movie that reminded me of similar times in my life."
"Based on the classic novel by Harper Lee, this wholesome adaptation stars Gregory Peck in an Oscar-winning part as Atticus Finch, a righteous defense lawyer during the depression era down South. He's a loving single parent who tries to instill values into his two children, Jem (Philip Alford) and his younger sister ""Scout"" (Mary Badham). The story is told as a flashback from the perspective of a now-grown Scout (who narrates) during one memorable summer in her youth where her father elected to defend a Negro farmhand named Tom Robinson (Brock Peters). At a time when black people were not well respected in small southern towns, Finch stands alone in his plight to help the innocent young man who has been wrongly accused of raping and beating a white woman. Brock Peters is highly sympathetic as the good-natured Robinson during an unfair courtroom trial, with Gregory Peck as his well-meaning attorney with the odds stacked against him. Fine acting also by young Alford and especially Badham as the children learning about bigotry through their dad in addition to the ongoing trial. Robert DuVall makes his very first motion picture appearance in a small but unforgettable part that remains crucial to the success of the story. ***1/2 out of ****"
"TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD
Although I am not a huge fan of trial movies, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD was a very different and amazing movie.  To me, this movie was really realistic in that it shows us a little bit of the prejudice that the United States lived back in the 1930's. All students should watch this movie to have a better understanding and learn the importance of fairness and treating everybody the same way. That might be a good method to learn more about realistic fiction.After seeing the movie I understood how important it is to acquire knowledge about different themes that directly or indirectly can affect us. TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is an excellent movie that was pretty much like the book, written by Harper Lee. It is a realistic film that includes idioms and symbols to give to the audience a better idea of the book and also a better understanding.  The movie emphasizes in the trial scenes but also in the history that was going on with the children and Boo. It gives us an idea of how different the world of the kids is and makes us understand that even though they are children they also understand what is going on around them and with the innocence and truth they can make adults understand them. The characters of the movie were definitely well played. The actors were really into their roles and made all scenes to be realistic to have an impact on the audience.The movie counts with an amazing group of actors that   portray their characters in an excellent way. However, the actor that I liked the most is Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch; who is a great person full of grace, greatness, style, and more. to me the most important virtue is his immense humanity. Gregory Peck was a person that knew how to treat people and was always worried about others. All his efforts brought him to the Kennedy Center Honors in 1991 where he was honored for all his achievements in life. People close to him showed love and respect to this great actor who taught us that we have to have a great heart to succeed in life like he did.Although I really liked the movie TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, in my opinion there are many things that I would definitely change to make it even better. Something that I think is really important is to include the scenes from the book that were left out, like the part were Mrs. Maudie's house got on fire or when Jem damaged Mrs. Duboses's garden. Personally I think that it would be more interesting to the young audience if the movie were in color, so definitely I would make it in color to attract people's attention and make them interested about the movie. The characters were well played by the actors but over all I would change some of them for others that I think would do it better and more realistically. Making changes in a movie is not an easy thing and might work or not. Some people would think that the changes you made were really good and you would really see the difference but you also have to be prepared to be rejected and criticize, even though those are some changes that I think would work for teenagers.Rating the movies you see is really important because it would help you to know what kind of person you are and what type of literature are you inclined for. As reader of the book I can compare it with the movie and I rated it also as a viewer. The movie shows the most important things of the book and emphasizes really well on the main ideas of it. They use good vocabulary that is easy to understand and itself explanatory, helping the viewers with symbolisms and idioms that are in the book. The movie is definitely better for a person that prefers it instead of a book, however it is very important to read the book first and then watch the movie to compare and understand better.TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a great movie that teaches us a lot about life; it shows reality and cruelty that makes us change our way of thinking. Racism and prejudice are present in our society, not as in the 1930's, but still here. I think that by watching this movie everybody would understand that life is hard to live in a society that rejects you and discriminates against you all the time without a valid reason, so I strongly recommend this movie to everyone. you will have goose bumps."
"Told in hindsight by Scout this is the story of how she and her brother remember one summer in the Deep South when their father, Atticus Finch defends a black man (Robinson) who has been accused of forcing himself on a white girl and then beating her.  Atticus finds himself in a battle for the truth in the face of racism and intolerance and also defending his children from the impact of the same on them.I first read the book in school and have re-read it several times as it has really stuck with me. Since then I have seen the film a couple of times but have never felt that it really reaches the same height as the book does. The telling of the story is at it's strongest in the courtroom as it takes on the principles of a courtroom thriller however outside of this central piece it is almost a Southern cliché  with the kids, the community etc.  It still works but it feels like a postcard compared to the reality of the South in the intolerance of the courtroom.The film doesn't totally bring through the themes of the books  instead focusing on the specifics.  This is necessary to make it all fit into the 130min running time but it is to the subject matter's detriment as it loses much of it's significance.  That's not to say it is not impacting, because it still is.  I do have a problem with the first half and the end of the film where the focus is entirely on the children before sudden jumps into the main plot.  In the book it is all part of the same thing, here it does feel like it is a different chapter.Peck is good in his usual moral indignation role and he is well supported by the two child actors who both seem natural  Badham (sister of the director) and Alford.  A very young looking Robert Duvall is in the film briefly and adds a bit of interest to the generally good supporting cast.  It is to the film's credit (considering the period and the setting) that the black characters are not just limited to `yessir' stereotypes although at times they come close.Overall I enjoyed this film and the courtroom scenes are pretty tense even knowing where it is going.  The narration of the grown up Scout is a little weak and some of the film appears to be wandering to no effect but it is still a good film.  I, however, would still rather re-read the book."
"I saw this movie when i was a kid. Then again during high school days, then again with my kids. My kids loved it. One of the greatest movie of all time. Even at a young age I was captivated by this seemingly simple story told through the eyes of children that I could easily relate to. Perhaps also it was the fact that the part of the story that dealt with Boo Radley, (ROBERT DUVALL) held a kind of mystery. My daughter kinda got scared of the character BOO. But once she saw the entire film, she too loved it. To me the character, Atticus Finch (GREGORY PECK) remains the top screen hero of all time. The child actors are excellent also- particularly young Mary Badham as Scout, the little girl . One of the most moving parts of the movie is when Atticus Finch is leaving the court room and the Reverend tells Scout to stand up your father is passing. This is a deeply moving and powerful film about right and wrong seen through the eyes of children. Mulligan's direction is flawless. Art Direction by Henry Bumstead and Set Decoration by Oliver Emert are brilliant. They indeed bring to life what a small Southern Town would have been like in the early thirties. Excellent cinematography by Russel Harlan. The use of black-and-white cinematography conveys the mood of Depression-era small-town America perfectly and one of the best things is the music by Elmer Bernstein. Gregory peck's best performance and very inspiring character. Very inspiring movie. Waiting to own it on a blu-ray."
"Well-made film from Harper Lee's controversial but justly-celebrated book with Gregory Peck standing pensively tall and mighty as Atticus Finch, one of the most warmly regarded literary figures of the past century. Mary Badham does sterling work as a young white girl in the South watching with interest as her lawyer-father defends a black man on trial for raping a white woman. The coming-of-age dramatics and the rural atmospherics are ladled smoothly but thickly, and the juxtaposition with the heated courtroom theatrics is a bit bumpy; still, all the trial scenes are riveting, and Peck certainly earns his Best Actor Oscar with his fatherly approach and quiet grace. The film is difficult at times and perhaps tries too hard at others (it has a heavy spirit), but it's also quite rich as a character-study and it has a profound affect on many people. *** from ****"
"This much-praised movie is about a lawyer and his children living in a racially divisive South in the 1930s. Although the central theme concerns the lawyer defending a black man accused of raping a white woman, much of the film is devoted to the exploits of the children as they play games and make trouble. Therein lies the problem. Watching the children at play is only mildly interesting. The focus shifts to the rape trial for a while and then its back to the children and a weird neighbor (Duvall), who seems to be from another movie. The film is poorly constructed, lacking focus. Peck is good as Finch, who is portrayed as a decent fellow but certainly not the greatest hero in American cinema as AFI would have us believe. Considering its reputation, a very disappointing film."
"Now i think this is a very good movie and a very good book. But just looking at the IMDb rating and the reviews, this movie is clearly overrated. I've read the book about 4 times and have seen the movie twice. Some very good things about the movie was adapting the book. It was very well adapted and stuck very true to the book. Gregory Peck did a great job as Atticus. Also Brock Peters did a very good job as Tom Robinson. Most people perform pretty well. That's not why this film is overrated. The movie when looking at it close is pretty bland. I mean the movie itself isn't that great. The movie can be slow at points, not all the characters were good (Dill and Mayella). The ending was different then the book and i liked the book ending much better. And overall the movie just didn't have anything special to offer. To sum it up perfectly. Its a good book adaptation movie (for the most part) with nothing great to offer and nothing bad either. I like it, it just doesn't deserve the praise it gets."
"I got on a kick of watching two things recently: 1) good courtroom dramas and/or 2) classics. imo this is neither.maybe way back in olden times this movie was something special but all I kept thinking was ""why are these kids in every scene?"" and ""when do we actually get to the court stuff?"" the former is apparently what the movie is about and the latter came and went before I knew it. I guess I could complain the court drama was too short but in hindsight that was actually a blessing.the afi top-10 all-time court dramas incomprehensibly has this as #1!! are you kidding me?? I mean I'm not a totally unsophisticated person but not only does the court portion come very late in the movie, almost as an afterthought, it was as thrilling as peeling potatoes.see this movie if you must but I hope you know more about why you want to see it than I did.ps anyone that actually was looking for an old-time court drama, ""witness for the prosecution"" was fantastic. quite corny in parts but good drama, very good legal stuff and charles laughton was riveting."
"One hates to be the skunk at the garden party but this movie simply isn't as good as its reputation might suggest. It is extremely dated and calculated in ways that are now obvious but probably worked back in 1962. The dialogue has a tendency to go on for too long in almost every scene, as points are hammered home continuously, didactically, but aside from the scenes that belong only to the children the film is dramatically leaden and top heavy in what were at the time 'dangerous' and 'radical' ideas about racism and injustice (though they were fashionable in Hollywood), and frequently the movie feels like a sermon, and a self-congratulatory one at that.As the story of children growing up in the Deep South during the Depression the film works fairly well. It is beautiful visually and the photography by the underrated Russell Harlan is flawless. The performances of the actors who play the children are superb. Had the movie stuck to being their story it might have been a masterpiece. The part about the elusive, ghostly Boo Radley struck a chord, and I suspect that most of us can remember a spooky neighbor or two and the stories we used to make up about them. So far, so good. But when the black man accused of rape entered the picture a different movie emerged: preachy, obvious, self-consciously genteel about bigotry being the preserve of poor, ignorant rural folks, and above all obvious. This is when it becomes a star vehicle for Gregory Peck, who delivers an extraordinarily self-righteous summation to the jury complete with ""for the love God!"", and I stopped believing what I was watching and I began thinking about some of the shabbier Rod Serling Twilight Zones of long ago, with their 'messages' about 'little people' at the end. The film shifts into high gear in the last act, with the attack on the children, which I still find frightening, but the damage had been done, and even with Boo (blessedly) back in the story the poetic mood of the earlier parts of the movie was recaptured only fitfully, and I had a feeling of having been set-up.
Some of the problem with the film is obviously the Harper Lee novel it was adapted from. Miss Lee wrote a good book but as a writer was a far cry from Faulkner or even Eudora Welty, and having reread large portions of it a few years ago I must say that it dates as badly as the movie. She was trying to do too much with her wistful story, and got her politics and poetics mixed up, and the result is an unsatisfactory stab at greatness, though I must say it's a good try. But alas she missed the mark, and so does the film. There's a good deal of sponantaneous feeling in the stuff about the kids, but when it shifts to grown-ups neither Miss Lee, director Robert Mulligan or screenwriter Horton Foote seems to know how to make things work. Suddenly the story turns moral with a vengeance. It's not easy to treat the issue of a man falsely accused of rape any other way, for sure, but it ruins the magical tone so meticulously built up in the earlier scenes. Yes, the world of childhood has as much to do with imagination as reality, and especially with imagination applied to reality as a means of interpretation, which in adults seems the preserve of artists and no one else. The move from childhood to adulthood is often tragic, as life's unpleasantries become unavoidable. Art at its best provides a respite from this as well as another way of seeing life, of feeling things differently and of thinking deeper thoughts. In art we have the opportunity to recapture at least some of the affect of childhood, but to do so with wisdom and understanding.In To Kill a Mockingbird we see a liberal take on childhood, as imagination is tranformed, in the course of the narrative, into a sense of civic responsibility. Children, mockingbirds and black folks are metamorphosed into a kind of helpless class. Only they, it seems, are truly in touch with nature, truth and the meaning of life. The adult whites are either good or bad, interesting only inasmuch as they have all the power and often use it badly. The trick, as the film implies, is to get these blinkered white grownups to appreciate the pure world of freedom and ease that the children, mockingbirds and blacks enjoy, and all will be well, or at least a whole lot better. But alas the reason the white grownups are so dull and moralistic, in good and bad ways, come from their sense of responsibility, which comes with power, and which children, mockingbirds and blacks don't have. When they do get power (viz. Lord Of the Flies) they prove as capable as adults of doing foul, nasty things. I think that Lee, Mulligan and Foote are aware of this contradiction, if only subconsciously, which is why the prevailing mood of the story is one of sadness."
"Before I start my explanation of the above statements, I would like to comment that I am an avid Gregory Peck fan and I have also found his work to be of exceptional quality. This movie is no exception. I have also read Harper Lee's novel of the same name and found it to succeed in every area and every issue that it was trying to portray. Unfortunately, this success did not transfer to film, even with Mr. Peck and a cast of exceptionally talented child-actors. Every aspect of the film, with the exception of Mr. Peck and the children, is lacking, misguided, and often tries to pull at the heartstrings of early 1960's viewers with lame set-ups and other devices used to show one side and one man as being absolutely unerring and without vice. The movie takes a while to develop and for the first half-hour focuses primarily on the children. The children do rather everyday things and converse with each other about nothing of consequence on the film. They finally decide to explore a ""haunted house"" to see the ""maniac"" that lives within it. While I felt that this avenue might lead somewhere, nothing of any consequence, albeit a small meeting with the maniac at the end of the film, came of this rather long and drawn out plot line. Next, we see that Mr. Peck, who portrays a compassionate, strong father and lawyer, is assigned to defend a black man who has supposedly committed a rape of a white female. Subsequent to this, there is never any conversation among Peck and the defendant, no evidence discussed prior to trial, and no real character development of the defendant and even to a larger extent Mr. Peck. We then see a few scattered scenes of the ultra-racist and completely ignorant father-of-the-victim, who tries his best to cause trouble and say dirty things to black people. Though he is shown as mean and stupid, he doesn't do anything particularly characteristic of an enraged racist father, he merely calls Mr. Peck a ""ni$%er lover "" and spits a lot. You will notice that he is not even with the angry mob that tells Mr. Peck to hand over the prisoner so that they can lynch him. Finally, we arrive at a trial, where it is unbelievable that this case would have even gone to trial based on certain obvious fact that you will see in the movie. In trying to say any more directly involving the film's plot, I would be spoiling the movie for you, but suffice it to say, if Mr. Peck were not in this film and did not give such a rousing courtroom speech, this movie would have been forgotten long ago. The direction is poor and uneven, plot tangents go untouched or under-developed, and many of the characters and actors seem rather silly. Instead of achieving what the book did in terms of portraying racism in the Depression South and the intriguing stories of the children, the film manages to seem poorly done, even cheap, and the child actors's obvious talents go to waste on dead end plot lines. Even the costuming seems badly done. You will notice that all of the whites wear overalls, while the ""enlightened"" Mr. Peck and a handful of kind blacks wear suits. In closing instead of being a thoughtful and poignant depiction of racism in the South, it seems contrived. My recommendation is to avoid this unless you are an avid Gregory Peck fan and read the novel. But if you really want to watch a movie close to this subject that is done well, try In the Heat of the Night or any number of Sidney Portier's films. 4/10"
"To Kill A Mockingbird is probably one of the most over evaluated movies of all time.The first hour is absolutely boring to death, endless and in the end pointless. The scenes follow one another very disjointly, with no binder, and it goes nowhere. There is no soul and one is close to a flat electroencephalogram watching these children play, because this is almost exclusively what it is about.Then comes the second part dealing mostly with the trial. This is what kind of saves the movie, and still, even if you get more or less carried away by the testimonies and demonstrations with the underlying themes of racism and segregation, it remains rather weak qualitatively.But what is the most disconcerting is the lack of coherence of the feature with the association of two parts that almost have nothing in common. One is under the impression of watching two completely different movies: chronicle of a childhood or anti-racist pamphlet, a choice should have been made..."
"Okay i think this was a pretty good movie. I also think it was a good book as well. But seriously this book and movie gets way too much credit. I hate to say this but i didn't like Scout's character in the movie. She was great in the book, but in the movie not so much. The movie seems rushed and kind of boring. Kind of a generic story. The characters were good and accurate to the book (especially Atticus)but Scout was terrible. She was annoying, very hard to understand, and had no emotion at all. This was a good movie but people treat it like it's the best movie ever made. COME ON! Im not saying it was bad, but if i were the director i would have done a better job."
"To Kill a Mockingbird is a wonderful movie, which is based on Harper's Lee novel and it is mainly about ''racial differences"" through the innocence eyes of Atticus's children ''Scout and Jem''.The film is depicted in a simple way which makes it even more interesting in a sense where the problem is showed in a so implicit way.The story occurs in the 1930 in old Maycomb town, ''Scout'' curious and inspirational daughter of the loyal and humble father ''Atticus'', the latter in charge of the defense of the black man Tom Robinson wrongly accused of raping Ewell's white woman.Atticus Finch famous lawyer of the county had to face the curiosity of his children most importantly ''Scout'', she was disturbed by what was happening and it was depicted in a naive way to show us how stupid the problem was, a problem which come from a grey nothingness that is unacceptable and understandable by the children minds and as it is better explained in the novel ''there is something in our world that makes men lose their heads''.Atticus '' Gregory Peck'' amazingly played the role of the lawyer, a white lawyer who's defending a black man against prejudice during an epoch when the black people suffered an incomprehensible discrimination, The court room scene where Atticus is seen so keen to defend and show that ''Tom Robinson'' is not guilty through a meaningful speech in which he pointed out the evidences.Robert Mulligan did a good job to convert the so famous novel into a wonderful movie even though the novel still has some more interesting discussions and actions but still the movie reflected that climate and image the county was in at that time.All in all, the movie panned out to convey to the audience the racial problems that occurred at that time and making it one of the best ''BLACK AND WHITE'' movies of all time.Highly Recommended!!"
"I wanted to be a lawyer after I saw this movie. Gregory Peck was astounding ;now that is acting, letting your face, body language, silences and actions speak the entire gamut.I followed the stories here through three different generations, the older generation Atticus Finch's set; watching him try to be a good example to his children while integrating himself into their lives, teaching them values unconsciously while setting standards and boundaries for discipline is a delight to watch. Miss Crawford and the old lady who was dying and Jem had to visit her, these bring an extended family element.The middle set : Boo Radley, whose eyes and vision is what follows the children round the neighbourhood ; living his dreams through them and bearing their heartaches as well.And the children ; Scout Finch is a most poignant storyteller; she relates the most significant things with colour and life. When they find the wax dolls in trees, the importance they attach to it, the feeling that Boo is watching and when she gets to meet Boo, she isn't at all scared, it's been so long that the anticipation of meeting him turns into respect. We grow with Scout at Atticus' knee, with Calpurnia, with Aunt Alexandra, with Jem & Dill, and finally in that epiphany scene with Boo (when she walks him home), she ages and time stands still and even when she returns to the present, she has become an adult in many ways; love, honour, sacrifice and selflessness all hold new meaning for her. She was never going to see the world through a child's perspective again.Boo was supposed to be scary, I'm thoroughly thrilled to know that it was a very young Robert Duvall.The storyline is simple but gripping, racism & prejudice burn long and slow and it takes the honour and faith of men like Atticus Finch and the sheriff to diffuse this or deal with it. When Boo kills Jem's Attacker Tom Ewell, the sheriff fabricates a story to protect Boo's privacy and the fact that he acted in defence of the children. As Miss Crawford says ""it's a sin to shoot a mockingbird as they sing all day and give us sweet music"" there are two mockingbirds; Tom Robinson and Boo Radley who have done nothing but try to co-exist and bring peace to their little world.The language belongs to the era; the settings are stark depicting the harshness, simplicity and ""beauty"" of those times. The themes of racism, superiority/inferiority complexes, sacrifice, respect, integrity and honour all resound strongly. It is a lesson in morals but a picture; a signpost for the future!! To Kill A Mockingbird reverberates with hope, while there is injustice, there will be those who believe in justice. Racism may always exist but there also those who believe in free will and equal; opportunities. At times all it takes is the simple voice of a child to remind us who we are.!!10/10"
"My taste in movies has changed in the 50+ years since To Kill a Mockingbird was released. I loved it then (I loved the book too) and have remembered it fondly ever since. But now it seems stilted and phony, even the stuff with the kids. Everybody declaims; nobody talks the way real people talk; and Gregory Peck is overbearing and pompous, stiff and smug and cold as an icepick.It's a self-important and pretentious movie, overloaded with phony down-homeness and condescending socio-political moralizing - not entertaining or enlightening at all. I'm glad I borrowed it from the library instead of paying anything for it, even the few pennies an online rental costs."
"This film may have been great once, but today it feels rather dated.Sure enough, the film looks and sounds great even by today's standards. It has a sort of fairy-tale feel to it, which is also pretty nice, but it's essentially a 1½ hour kids film with 30 minutes of courtroom drama oddly spliced in there. Therefore, I can't help but feel that the story and the way people act turns very naive at times (Little girl to angry lynch mob: Please, don't be mean! Angry lynch mob: Well... alright then.).And while the movie deals with racism, it does so with such stereotypes that it looses the edge. The blacks are humble good people (saved only by the grace of white super-dad Peck), and the most whites are a bunch of snarling rednecks. The kids are surprisingly good actors, and Dill may be one of the coolest kids I've seen on film, but after an hour of them running around playing, you grow tired of it. Peck (as the best, most caring, fantastic single parent in history) does one of those performances that you're supposed to really admire, but I think it's pretty stiff and stilted.Overall, it's good in parts, but it lacks that ""something special"" that can turn it into a classic. [4/10]"
"Spoilers herein.Here is a film that is impossible to view as it was intended. That is because its effect was dependent on the cultural context in which it appeared. It was bold, working to explicitly redefine decency during one of the periodic self-examinations of the country. I saw it in 1962, and both of us are quite different now.Judging it now, apart from its historical significance, there seem some major inadequacies. In my mind, this is very much like `How Green Was My Valley,' which was wonderfully photographed and staged, but which had a hokey, romanticized story and some unrealistic acting. Here too. Peck may have been a loved performer, but he just doesn't have the stuff for this role. Everyone else who is on screen outacts him, is more real. More rooted in place. More naturally motivated.The book uses the thread of the story (sexual frustration, false accusation, cowardly herd condemnation, resentful attack, salvation by an innocent guardian) as mere chickenwire into which is woven many terrific small chunks of language. That language is not poetic in the sense of using the familiar to define the unfamiliar; instead it works the other way and is shocking and effective. To appreciate the book, you have to know Truman Capote's manner of enlarging the small, finding decision points inside characters and stringing them together in an external logic. Lee's approach to writing is to add another layer of observation: essentially she is reporting her view of what his view would have been. (The Dill character is Capote.) The mockingbird is a mimic who reports the songs of other birds found in its territory. It is fiercely territorial and seems to define its own identity as definer/reporter of that place.The film jettisons all this to give us a simple morality play. What a scandal. If the primary tone of the book is the respect for the richness of tradition in place, that respect is trampled by Hollywood. Well, nothing new there.But what we do get is some very interesting staging of the children. These kids are so formally choreographed, it is almost balletic. There is some movement, sometimes rushing movement, but everything is toward the goal of getting them in lovely group positions. Very theatrical, and I must say, very effective. None of their movements are natural, all come from the director's mind. But they perform them naturally, and this carries over the philosophy of how the story is told in the book. Some of the spooky staging is from ""Meet Me in St Louis.""This film has a very high rating in the IMDB system. I suppose most of these votes come from schoolchildren who are assigned this film as homework. The level of the morality play is just right for them, and they feel enobled.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements."
"Splendid and flavorful rendition based on bestselling novel written by Harper Lee , being perfectly scripted by Horton Foote . The film takes place from the summer of 1932 to October 31, 1933 , Atticus Finch, (Gregory Peck's favorite work , who earned a deserved Academy Award) , a lawyer in the Depression-era South, defends a black man (Brock Peters) against an undeserved rape charge . Meanwhile , he attempts to explain proceedings to his kids (Mary Badham , Philip Alford) , trying to understand life and against social prejudice . The most beloved and widely read Pulitzer Prize Winner by Harper Lee now comes vividly alive on the screen in this magnificent picture , being leisurely narrated and stunningly filmed . Interesting and thought-provoking screenplay by Horton Foote who also earned an Oscar along with Gregory Peck . Well realized and deliberately paced ; being a powerful retelling , including evocative settings , appropriate cinematography in white and black by cameraman Russell Harlan and rousing musical score . Extraordinary acting by Gregory Peck as a small-town advocate at law who defends an African-American accused of rape . Support cast is frankly well ; cast members such as Mary Badham (Scout), film debut by Robert Duvall (Boo), Frank Overton (Heck Tate), Collin Wilcox Paxton (Mayella), Ruth White , Richard Hale , Paul Fix , and William Windom (Mr. Gilmer) , being narrated by Kim Stanley . Mary Badham became the youngest girl to receive an Oscar nomination, ironically losing the award to another child actress, Patty Duke in The miracle worker (1962). Special mention to Brock Peters , as an inmate , wrongly accused as rapist ; he started to cry while shooting the testifying scene, without rehearsing it this way, and Gregory Peck said that he had to look past him, instead of looking him in the eye, without choking up himself . With the death of Rosemary Murphy (Maudie Atkinson) on July 5, 2014, Robert Duvall (Boo Radley) is the film's last surviving adult cast member . Sensitive as well as evocative musical score by the great Elmer Bernstein ; the piano in Elmer Bernstein's score was played by John Williams . Adequate production and set design , as Art directors Alexander Golitzen and Henry Bumstead had an entire reconstruction of the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama, built on the Universal backlot at a cost of $225,000 , as the set contained more than 30 buildings . The motion picture was magnificently directed by Robert Mulligan . Robert's way of handling his child actors was to let them play together while keeping the cameras as unobtrusive as possible. It is the first of six films director Robert Mulligan made with his producer partner, Alan J. Pakula . Director Robert Mulligan and producer Alan J. Pakula traveled to Harper Lee's hometown of Monroeville but found it unsuitable for filming , the town had been modernized ; therefore the production team constructed their own ideal version of Monroeville on a backlot at Universal . Robert Mulligan was a good filmmaker expert on dramas such as he proved in ¨Bloodbrothers¨ , ¨Baby the rain must fall¨, ¨Kiss me goodbye¨ , ¨Same time , next year¨ , ¨The Nickel Ride¨, ¨The man in the moon¨ , being his greatest successes the followings : the eerie tale of supernatural titled ¨The other¨, the adolescent drama ¨Summer of 42¨ and this ¨¨To kill a mockingbird¨ . The latter ranked #1 on the American Film Institute's list of the 10 greatest films in the genre ""Courtroom Drama"" and in 2007, the American Film Institute ranked this as the #25 Greatest Movie of All Time."
"First of all, why people don't make this type of film now? Simple story plot but all credit goes to the director. I mean how one can make so simple and sound film? Child actress performed nicely like she is not acting, she is feeling every moment. This movie has no mystery, has no drama but this movie has soundness that will refresh your mind."
"I wasn't yet the movie fan I am today but the first time I saw the American Film Institute's Top 100 heroes and villains, I could recognize almost every name, I expected a few exceptions but certainly not the number one hero: Atticus Finch, played by Gregory Peck, in the adaptation of Harper Lee's Pulitzer-winning ""To Kill a Mockingbird"". Seriously, who was that dork who had the nerve to be worthier of the first spot than Indiana Jones or James Bond and that I wasn't even familiar with?And ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" kept popping up in every AFI list and even on IMDb Top 250, so it was an emergency case in my watch-list of fresh new movie fan. So, I saw the film and could see what was so heroic about this noble-hearted white knight of the South, who dared to question racism at a time where it was common banality. And he was played by the noblest of all actors: Gregory Peck. I often criticized his acting as wooden but perhaps this is the one instance where it did fit the character and his Oscar wasn't stolen although O'Toole as Lawrence of Arabia, Lemmon in ""Days of Wine and Roses"" and Lancaster as ""Birdman of Alcatraz"" had more complex personalities to play with.But there was something crowd-pleasing in the story of Atticus Finch, something that exceeded the expectations of cinema and satisfied the Hollywood conscience, it was still a time of relative innocence where the problem of racism could only be displayed through a white people centered story. Not that it's a bad thing but I wish the film had kept its original tone, as a story seen from the perspective of a growing precocious tomboy named Scout (Mary Badham), whose perception of her lawyer of a father and of the world of adults is influenced by one of the cases he must handle. ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is a childhood story, inspired from Lee's memories of the tired Southern town of Maycomb, but the film carries a child-like innocence that doesn't fit the case.Scout is a girl spending time jumping, climbing hills and trees with her brother Jem and their friend Dill, inspired by her childhood friend Truman Capote, and she sees her widowed father as a super-figure who has an answer for every question. And it seems that the film has somewhat embraced this creed and made Atticus Finch the hero of this picture, which is puzzling because he's not the focus for the whole first act. But we're supposed to embrace his nobility and optimism because it is obvious the case he must defend is a sham, and it doesn't even take courage but common sense. It's not much Atticus who's noble but the other people who are downright bigots and hateful. It's an insult to intelligence that Robinson is declared guilty despite Finch' invitation for humanism and empathy, but the real heroism would have been to convert them. Finch's aura is one of a preacher, powerful, symbolic but eventually, useless.I actually enjoyed the film and it's never as good as when it plunges you in the children universe and their interpretation of spooky local stories. Scout is like a little sponge trying to understand and appreciate the world as it comes to her eyes, learning from her father,the meaning of words like 'empathy', and the subplot also involves the identity of Boo Radley, which highlights one of these aspects of childhood when you tend to believe the adults, until you realize that they're somewhat corrupted and unworthy of trust. But when Atticus learns the news about the death of Robinson, I couldn't believe he believed he tried to escape. That the film doesn't even exploit the event and makes it look as it really happened that way, that the Black people would just be passive observers with no capability for action and when the town drunk, evil Ewell, spits on Finch' face, he doesn't flinch, I thought the whole sanctification of Finch was overplayed. A preacher, he might be, but a saint, he wasn't. Maybe in the eyes of her daughter, but at that point, the film was told from the adult perspective, not only it didn't work, but it didn't even match the character.Finch was genuinely furious during his trial statement, he expected to save his client but he was shot dead in what seems to be obvious lynching, instead of prosecuting the case and serving the cause to the fullest, he accepts the outcome and when he's confronted to Ewell, he takes the spit like Jesus would take a slap. Robsinson was dead at that time, was Finch so perfect that he couldn't even give the guy the punch he deserved, what was to lose anyway? Couldn't one of the black guys do it? No, it had to be the hand of God through the providential Boo Radley (a youngish Robert Duvall) to punish the bad guy as to mystify the whole thing again, and creates some deep symbolism between a sordid case of rape and the local village idiot. An unpunished crime to avenge the first, too much religious symbolism for what should have been a tale from a child's eye.In the movie ""Capote"", when commenting about the success of the book, Capote says ""I don't know what the fuss is all about"". Speaking for myself, I can understand why the film is such a celebrated classic, but it doesn't hold up very well in today's context while the masterpiece from Capote ""In Cold Blood"" says as much as human nature and vileness as the book and is still relevant today. ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is a classic, no doubt about that, but not all classics are supposed to be perfect. Maybe I will find in the book these missing elements of 'perfections' though I trust Capote's opinion on it."
"For some reason, it took a long time before I ever gave this movie a look, and when I finally did last year I was very pleased and saw why all the fuss was made over it. Then, I watched it again about six months later and got disgusted with some of it. Maybe I should have waited another 40 years between viewings! (Only kidding)THE GOOD - Well, I can start with the fine acting and interesting characters, led by Gregory Peck as ""Atticus Finch,"" one of the more noble characters ever put on screen. He is single father taking care of two adolescents and is a strong moral man who stands for all that is right. The main theme of the movie is racism, and I'm sure this much bigger impact 44 years ago than today. It wasn't long after this that the U.S. was embroiled in numerous race riots. It was a tumultuous decade, to say the least. There also is a tiny sub-plot in this story which involves another kind of bias, one against the mentally-ill or simply against pre-conceived notions we might have of people who are different from us.Not only is Peck outstanding, but kudos to the kids in here, too, beginning with Mary Badham as young ""Scout."" She only made one other movie and never acted as an adult. She's a great kid in here and winsome in a tomboy-ish way. Her brother ""Jem"" (Philip Alvord) also is good, and has a wonderful scene in front of the courthouse protecting his dad against a mob. New-found friend ""Dill Harris"" (John Megna) has a much shorter role but completes the trio of youngsters who all prove to be capable actors. Kim Stanley narrates the film as grownup ""Scout"" looking back on those days. Brock Peters is good as the black man accused of something he didn't do, and it was interesting to see Robert Duvall in, I believe, his first movie role. He had done TV for a couple of years prior to this film. His role, however, was right at the end of the film and he said very little, if anything, as the misunderstood ""Boo Radley."" This is a very nicely photographed film with great lighting in here. The whole thing was shot on a Hollywood set. It looks super on the latest special-edition two-disc DVD. I enjoy watching the great black-and-white images in here but then again, it's easier to produce perfect lighting like this rather than going on actual location and adjusting to the conditions. Still, it's a visual treat.BAD - In the filmmakers' zeal to show the ugliness of racism they were insultingly biased in the courtroom finale and unrealistic in portraying the lead male racist. Being ""fair and balanced"" was not something shown in coverage of the trial since the most dramatic parts - the final summations - are wonderfully and powerfully presented by defense attorney Finch but we never hear the prosecution summation! What happened to that speech? We only hear one side! At least give us viewers credit for having enough common sense to know what's right after we hear both sides. The film world rarely treats the moviegoers intelligently, preferring to hit us over the heads with their agendas instead. And, showing this redneck ""Bob Ewell"" (James Anderson) going out all alone and ranting and raving in front of house full of blacks late at night is ridiculous. Nobody, but nobody is that stupid: white, black or any color. But, once again, the filmmakers do everything they can to manipulate their audience and this film is extremely manipulative. OVERALL - Nonetheless, despite the obvious bias it's still a good, powerful story with great moral lessons. It also gives us something we don't see much in modern movies: an ideal father figure, not just in the way he handles his kids but all adults, too. You can't find a much better role model. I'd like to see more of this types of people on film."
"No better movie has been made about character. I believe most students read the book and watch the movie. That's not good enough. It should be required reading and viewing. The movie stands on its own for Gregory Peck's performance, which is my favorite by any actor, ever. Decency, dignity, and character are three things we all need more in our lives."
"Watched this for school years ago when we were reading the book, this is by far the worst movie iv ever seen. very dull, very long, the ending is the dumbest thing iv ever seen ! i mean really ???? the black guy was proven innocent because he could only use one hand ...? what ..??? and supposedly you can't choke someone with one hand ... hahaha, iv never tried that, but i feel like it would work!"
"I'd never seen To Kill A Mocking Bird, or read the book. I purchased it thinking I would see one of the great movies of all time. A classic. After watching the first ten minutes I literally had to double check the DVD case to make sure I was watching the correct movie. . .this is a classic? Trying to enjoying it, I kept telling myself, ""It was made in the early sixties. Movie standards were different back then. Scripts weren't as tight. Viewers didn't demand details that made the movies realistic. Etc.etc."" Well, that didn't help. In a word, the movie was just plain hokey.I swear, the reason this movie got such acclaim at the time is because the main character stood up for a black man in court who was accused of raping a white women. It's because it championed a black man, and showed how evil some southern white folks could be. If it would have been a white man who'd been wrongly accused of raping white woman I'm sure the media and viewers would have not given it a second thought. This is not a great movie by any means, in any era."
"""To Kill a Mockingbird"" centers mainly around three characters: Scout, Jem and their father Atticus, who raises his children to the best of his ability while defending a black man accused of raping a white women.I first saw ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" shortly after reading the book in my high school English class. Being born less than 20 years ago I'd lie if I said I was not slightly put off by it being in black and white; how stupid was I. The book itself was great and to my surprise the movie portrayed Harper Lee's story excellently. To those still wondering whether to watch this 1962 classic, do it! The cinematography is excellent, but what really makes this movie is the performance put on by Gregory Peck; our hero in this movie and perhaps the greatest film hero ever!There are some powerful scenes which showcases Atticus's moral outlook on life and the story of how he defends a black man whose fate has already been sealed is sad yet inspiring. One line that stuck to me from the novel is Miss Maudie telling Scout after the trial had been lost: ""I thought, Atticus Finch won't win, he can't win, but he's the only man in these parts who can keep a jury out so long on a case like that."" This pretty much sums up Atticus's determination to give Tom Robinson a fair trial despite what the rest of the community may think.The child acting was impressive and the characters of Scout and Jem were portrayed as children should. They were naive and silly, doing stupid things and disobeying their father time and time again. But during the three year time spine in which this movie plays off you see them growing, taking more of Atticus's advice in along the way. Scout is of course our main protagonist and she and her brother were highly relatable and contributed to the success of this movie.Conclusion:I recommend this to almost everyone. Young lawyers, movie-lovers and most importantly to all the fans of the novel who haven't seen this film: You won't be disappointed!www.250moviereviews.wordpress.com"
"Oh boy this movie is so awesome you will find yourself flying among the Angels when you watch it, or roughly about as high as they fly. This movie is so great it's like finding out your brother is famous.This film is based on a book, but that doesn't mean it's boring like all that other rubbish. In this case it means that the film is even better than possibly all other films based on books, but possibly in a different way to the way you might be expecting.The movie is all about a raper who must face his crimes and stand trial (as was traditional in the time and place where the movie takes place, and in that time too). The man who defends him as his attorney is a man with three kids, only one of them lives next door.The focus is on his kids as they fool around with rubber wheels and various other machinations. The film is told through their eyes, even though they are WAY TOO YOUNG to be attorneys.I have found it possible to think that this film is one of the most beautiful films there has ever been in the world. Even though I cried during the duration of this film and I usually don't like that at all (in fact I hate it if a film makes me cry because I feel like a baby), in this case I can forgive it because when I cried I had a lot of joy in my heart that made it swell up and make me cry from my eyes. But I did have a big smile on my wet face when I was crying. You will feel the same too if you see it, like dancing with your Grandfather."
"While I must confess to not having read Harper Lee's novel, this movie might possibly rank with me as the greatest cinematic drama ever. It paints a vivid picture of the incredible injustice of racism in the 1930's South, a character study of a very principled lawyer, and a bittersweet view of childhood's innocence.The film relates the story of a widowed Southern lawyer named Atticus Finch, as seen through the eyes of his tomboyish young daughter, Scout. Together with her older brother Jem and their sidekick Dill, the children explore the goings on of their local neighbourhood in Macon, Georgia. They also witness the South's entrenched racism in their own hometown when their father takes on the case of defending an innocent black man, Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping a local white girl. Of course the jury is all male & all white, and many of the prejudiced townsfolk do not take kindly to Robinson's defending lawyer, even extending their outrage to Atticus's children. Meanwhile, the youngsters are inquisitive about their reclusive neighbour Boo Bradley, rumoured to be a dangerous madman.It would be difficult to imagine a more compelling and personal depiction of racism than this false accusation laid against the harmless, kind hearted Tom Robinson. These trumped up charges in fact result from the victim Mayella's own sense of guilt. Brock Peters perfectly captures the quiet humanity of this utterly sympathetic, despairing defendant who faces a predictable verdict from jury members who see all black people as liars. The scene where he breaks down on the witness stand will haunt you forever. Robinson's humble home and anguished family round out the portrait of this travesty of justice. Atticus Finch is surely the most principled, gentlemanly fictional character ever conceived, masterfully portrayed here by Gregory Peck, himself such an endearing gentleman. He brilliantly captures Atticus's sense of justice and morality as he takes on the unpopular and even potentially dangerous task of defending Robinson. This is a kind and modest man who treats everyone with equal respect...black and white, rich and poor...the white Sheriff, his black housekeeper, his unjustly accused client, his children, his neighbours, the poverty stricken but proud farmer who pays him with vegetables for past legal services. Atticus never appears more dignified than during his controlled response to a churl who spits upon him. He displays patience and understanding with his two motherless children, as he quietly tries to teach them true values of fairness and decency. If only every child had a father with the integrity of Atticus Finch to emulate, this world would surely be a wonderful place.The three children are engagingly portrayed by marvelous, perfectly cast young stars, the entire story depicted through their eyes. Scout is a feisty tomboy, unwillingly forced to don a dress for her school debut and later prone to fighting with any schoolboy who offends her. Her older brother Jem is fiercely protective of his father, displays endless curiosity about neighbour Boo, and mockingly accuses his sister of 'becoming more like a girl every day'. Their chum Dill, a funny looking and comical fellow, describes himself as 'little but old'. What an appealing and amusing trio they make! Atticus's black housekeeper, Calpurnia, is a concerned and respected mother figure, who takes Scout severely to task for her rude manners toward her young lunch guest! The 1930's Southern small town neighbourhood is perfectly captured. Many of the scenes occur on the porches and in the yards, with the kids up to their assorted shenanigans. Their tree house and tire swing bring back childhood memories, and I can still hear those crickets. Unfolding events compel these innocent youngsters to face the sad adult realities of racism and injustice. Boo teaches the children a valuable lesson about the dangers of preconceptions, and gives the adults an unforgettable sense of true justice. Unexpectedly, he proves to be part of the title's mockingbird allusion.The atmosphere in the small town courtroom is brought vividly to life as the spectators fan themselves against the stifling Georgia heat. William Windom (from Murder She Wrote) portrays the smirking prosecutor. The trial is itself gripping and Atticus's concluding remarks riveting and inspiring. During the final courtroom scene, the local black townsfolk reveal with great dignity their respect and appreciation for Atticus. This film is a moving tribute to those who fought against the evils of racial discrimination and an incredible masterpiece that no one should miss. Though tragic, it proves ultimately uplifting."
"What a wonderful adaptation of the novel. I had never seen this film, but when it came up on UK DVD release this week I decided to go for it. I'm so glad I did!Wonderfully atmospheric, superb acting and a wonderful score.
Note to UK readers...don't be put off by the badly colourised pictures on the case and the fact that the back of the DVD says its in colour...it isn't!"
"The lessons of To Kill A Mockingbird have stayed with me since the first time I saw it over thirty years ago.  I was young then, but, I related to Scout and Dill having grown up in a small town myself. My own father was more like Mr. Ewell than Atticus.  The lessons I learned from Atticus helped me grow up to be someone other than what I might have in a dysfunctional family.  I learned to stand up for what I believed in, to appreciate others for whom they were and to use the intellect that came naturally to do so!"
This is an excellent movie. I have seen it at least 10 times.  Gregory Peck was outstanding in it. This movie has suspense in it. It also shows how prejudice can hurt people. I would recommend this movie as a must see.
"The only two ""classics"" that still make the annual best seller lists are To Kill a Mockingbird & Catcher in the Rye. ""Catcher"" was spared from being made into a movie, and was also spared the liberal spin machine. Mockingbird was about the everyday life of kids growing up in the rural South. The focus was 80% on the kids. In the background, the father Atticus Finch was a lawyer who took on the case of a young black man accused of a sexual crime against a White. In the movie, the lawyer and the trial are in front-and-center focus, and with Gregory Peck's ham-from-hell overacting, Atticus Finch became the most phony hero in movie history. In the film, the accused black was anything but an Ice T (before he reformed and turned TV cop) menace. No, he was obviously a sweet and reserved person --- and everybody in town knew it. So this great lawyer hero had to take on alleged racial prejudice, not real prejudice but movie-style prejudice, twisting flimsy and virtually non existent ""evidence"" to get these nasty bigots ""to see"" through old Atticus Finch's liberal eyes.... The only thing less brave than Gregory Peck's paper hero were the filmmakers. Remember, liberalism was very much in mode when this movie was released. Real courage was to disagree with the liberal dogma while Time, Newsweek, et cetera praised it in lockstep. Spitting on the rural South was an active part of that dogma, the theme of dozens of movies, and a virtual guarantee of 4-star reviews. My advice: Get the book, read it; it's great."
"I've always heard this was a great movie, so I had high expectations. Little did I expect such an unrealistic, melodramatic piece of crap. ""Super Lawyer Tries To Save The South From Itself."" He's poor. He's rich. He's enlightened. He's educated. He's a crack shot. He stands down a mob (with the help of his wise and brave children). Where was the Sheriff? No need for a Sheriff when you've got Super Lawyer. He'll guard the jail all by himself. He is struggling against Ignorance, aided by the Mindless Duvalls of the world - who are guided by their innate goodness God gave them. I have seldom seen such claptrap outside of the Hallmark Channel, where the hero is always a woman who exhibits the same strengths and struggles. It's all so puerile."
"(Possible spoilers) Surely Harper Lee's morality tale was an impressive filming of an essential novel in 1962, but from the vantage point of four decades-plus it's an old-smoothie job -- respectful, careful, and entirely too pleased with itself. It's in black and white, and so are its issues -- you know from the first shot of the Ewells, from costuming, lighting, and angle, that they're white trash; you know from the first ennobling look at Tom Robinson that he's an innocent victim. You never have to think -- the movie tells you what you're supposed to think and feel at every juncture.Peck's Finch is a plaster saint; I suspect that the praise heaped on him, and the Oscar, has more to do with the quiet heroism of the character (who wouldn't want a father, a lawyer -- heck, a President -- like Atticus Finch?) than any great acting on his part. The storytelling strains credibility at some crucial junctures: Surely the redneck lynching crowd wouldn't be dispersed that readily by The Simple Wholesome Innocence of a Child, and does Atticus have to be, on top of everything else, a crackerjack rifleman? There's Elmer Bernstein's treacly scoring to underline the already over emphatic pontificating, and the photography, handsome as it is, pretties up a small Southern town in the Depression perhaps more than necessary. On the plus side, yes, it's an unusually up-close and incisive look at the growing pains of early childhood, and Mary Badham's Scout hits remarkably few false notes. Pauline Kael once dismissed it, scornfully, as ""a movie the industry can be proud of,"" and I know what she meant -- its prime function seems to be to allow non-bigots to congratulate themselves on their open minds. The fact that its viewpoint is right, proper, and laudable doesn't make the movie any less smug."
"Abacus Finch (Gregory Peck) is a widow with two children, Jim and Scout. His wife is dead. Mr. Finch is a lawyer whose hired to defend a black man named Tom (Lou Brock), who was falsely accused of killing a mockingbird which are an endangered species. In those days (1962), whites were prejudiced against blacks whom were a different race than themselves in the South. The Finch's also have a mysteryious neighbor named Boo Radley (Clea Duvall). Boo is a albino who only comes out at night. One night when Jim and Scout are walking home from trick or treating they are attacked by a pedaphile. Boo Radley was out at night and rescued them. Boo hides behind Jim's bedroom door. Abacus was so grateful that he invited Bo to live with them.also recommended : ""The Paradine Case"", ""Anatomy of a Murder"", "" 12 Angry Men"", ""In the Heat of the Night"", ""To Kill a Clown"", ""A Time to Kill"", ""A View to a Kill"", ""Branded to Kill"", ""Hard to Kill"", ""License to Kill"", ""Shoot to Kill"", Dressed to Kill"", ""Stripped to Kill"", ""The Birds"", ""The Omen"" (1976 & 2006), ""The Boys From Brazil"", ""The Boys in the Band"", ""And the Band Played On"", ""Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the Bronx"", ""Joey (aka Making Contact)"", and ""The Beyond""."
"Harper Lee created a classic in her novel. This film adaptation is probably the best novel to film ever. It stars Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch in his Oscar winning role. Mary Badham plays the unforgettable Scout. One of the main reasons that I purchased the film was to see Ruth White in her performance as miserable Mrs. Dubose. Sadly she had a much bigger role in the novel but for everybody involved in this film classic, it was worth any minute of time. Alice Ghostley is also in the film as one of the mother and neighbor. Rosemary Murphy plays Maudie Atkinson. The film is first rate and classic which should never be remade even for today's audiences. It stands on it's own much Godfather and Citizen Kane. Please don't remake this film with today's stars."
"The film is unique in it's viewpoint, being that of the children in the movie and especially that of it's narrator , the girl ""scout"".With that viewpoint, the film deals with mature adult matters as seen through the children's eyes. It thrusts us into their world with their playfulness and fears, especially from their mad next door Neighbor.There are certain scenes that are depicted as horror with the right lighting and music to accompany them , for it is the childhood fears that are depicted there , thus letting us experience it through their eyes.The children are there in almost every scene, whether as witnesses or as the main attention. The child actors give some of the best performances I have ever seen of actors their age. They truly behave like kids do, and not like child actors acting as children, they are truly believable. And let's not forget Gregory Peck giving one of his best performances as the loving protecting father on one side, and the protector of justice on the other, as he is defending an innocent black man in the racist American south.In conclusion a great family drama, told with tenderness and care, depicted through the eyes of the children."
"This is a great movie if you have the stomach flu and are over 45. It also helps to be a white liberal who wishes he could be the kind of upright, loving, articulate father Gregory Peck plays in ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" I remember watching the movie when it was originally released in 1962 after having read the book. I am not the kind of person who cries easily, but I remembered crying over both the book and the movie. It was with my tears in mind and a difficult-to-define recollection that this is truly one of the great films that caused me to rent the DVD.Watching it made me realize that there is a world out there that doesn't have the stomach flu. ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" is better than any stomach remedy if you are of the right demographic, as I am. I cannot imagine a 22 year-old (one of my children is 22) sitting still for the slow-moving pace of the drama or for the tedious subplot concerning the emotionally-disturbed young man who lives in the neighborhood.This is a movie about racial injustice and how wonderful Gregory Peck is to defend a poor, frightened black man who is accused of rape in the South during the Depression. The sort of injustice described here is now lost to boring history books. Racism in America still exists, but not this particular flavor of racism that those of us who found it so familiar can appreciate. The racism I have in mind is like a fine old wine; namely African-Americans not treated as human beings in the deep South while a noble white guy enters the fray and gets credit for being noble.Watching this movie is like reliving the bad old days when every stereotype is blatantly reenacted and the pleasure is in watching which stereotype will come next. This is not a movie about how hard it was to be black in the South in 1932. This is a movie about how pleasurable it is to remember the days when a brave white man like Gregory Peck represented what we like to think of as bravery and racial justice.My guess is that most 22 year-olds wouldn't like Gregory Peck even if they knew who he was. Try it and see. Even if ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" does not stand the test of time, it still will be a comfort in a time of stress to folks like me."
"At first glance this movie/book seems like an innocuous little HUCKLEBERRY FINN knockoff -- the pitch is seemingly the same, i.e. ""cute kids battle racism."" But look a bit closer and you see a great deal of smug, fatuous hypocrisy in the way race and class are presented in this dreary, pious and interminable sermon of a movie. Blacks are mistreated. Who's to blame? Why, those no-account white trash Ewells who live down by the dump. Who comes to the rescue? Why those affluent, civilized Finches. You don't need to be a genius to figure out that whatever the Finch family has comes from generations of exploitation and racial as well as class privilege. They are the first family in Maycomb because their ancestors owned the most slaves. Whatever goodwill they feel towards blacks now does not require any self-sacrifice or self knowledge on their part. They have the luxury of doing what's right while holding onto all the privileges their ancestors won for them by doing what was wrong. The Finches don't make sacrifices to end racism, they just punish the Ewells -- the whites who have benefited least from racism do all of the dirty work and take all of the blame. It is for just this reason that this movie/book is so popular with clueless types like high school teachers and liberal columnists. (Hello, Cynthia Tucker! Hello, Anna Quindlen! Hello, Kathleen Parker!) Unlike HUCKLEBERRY FINN, this book lets well to do white folks off the hook by reassuring them that it's only the white trash who will have to pay the price for racial justice. The thing that keeps HUCKLEBERRY FINN controversial after 150 years is that it questions both race AND class privilege. (Wealthy Widow Douglas is just as brutal in her racism as ignorant Pap Finn.) TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a tired, cynical attempt to defend the status quo while pretending to challenge it. As Aunt Maudie puts it (with no sense of irony at all) ""it's the people of BREEDING who must do something to stop this."" The unpleasant fact that it was people of ""breeding"" who promoted (and profited from) slavery in the first place is rigorously suppressed -- and that is why this book is a wholesome classroom favorite while bad boy HUCKLEBERRY FINN remains as dangerous as ever."
"I remember really enjoying Harper Lee's novel when I read it more than 25 years ago. The film is pretty good, I guess. The child actors all did wonderfully. Gregory Peck did well enough as Atticus Finch, although I'm not sure it was an Oscar-worthy performance. The whole rape trial sequence seems overly preachy to me now. I suppose that in the early '60's there may have been people unaware of the realities of Jim Crow, but nowadays it has been forced down everyone's throat for decades. The heroic liberal fighting injustice is a theme whose time has long passed, and viewing TKAM now hasn't the sort of impact that I imagine it did then. Grade: C"
"The film starts with the same essence as the book, but through experience I've learned not to compare much - they are two very different mediums.The problem begins with the film pacing up and skipping important events that build up motives of the characters and causes shift in their intent. Towards the end all of it looks like a rush. The importance and the the details of how grave the case of a lawyer actually backing up black man is lost in translation across the medium.Well, all of that can be forgiven and the film still somehow works along. But the contextual shock of a man attacking children is totally lost on screenplay, many dialog were changed which the climax dry and juice-less - taking all emotions out of it.Characters, especially Atticus's, were portrayed and played out very well. They are the only reason the film works."
"To Kill A Mockingbird, both as a book and a movie, has been hailed as a classic, a masterpiece, etc. I personally don't see what the big hoopla is.It seems that the movie is trying to be deep, trying to be artistic...and while a bit deep with the whole storyline of Tom's trial, in reality, that's all it did-try.They story is set in Maycomb County, Alabama, in the midst of the Great Depression. It follows the life of Scout Finch, a little girl growing up in that county. Basically, it's about what's going on with the town and what's going on with Scout and her family throughout her growth, leading to different ""storylines"" of events that happens to Scout and the rest of the Finch's.Probably the only storyline I really appreciated was the story of Tom Robinson's trial. Atticus (Scout's father) was defending Tom in a rape case, and since Tom was black, this was taboo in Maycomb. This story really showed unfairness and how cruel prejudice and hate can be. Maybe if the movie was only centered around that story instead of throwing in aspects like Boo Radley, Dill, and others, I would consider calling this movie a classic.I also might've enjoyed it more if they had had a different main character. I personally couldn't stand Scout. I understand that she was supposed to be an innocent, unknowing little girl, but she came off as an annoying, loud, obnoxious brat that I wanted to slap throughout the entire movie. Maybe if it had been from Atticus' point of view, or Jem's, or just ANYONE aside from Scout, I might've enjoyed the movie more.The cinematic work was pretty good, but not extremely artistic. It's a far cry from the fantastic cinematic elements of films such as ""Traffic"" and ""Psycho"". While it had some good angle work and good lighting techniques, it wasn't really a great film in the cinematic field. To be fair, though, I suppose that that's not what the movie was going for.I give it a 3/10. The story involving the trial was beautiful, there was some good acting (Gregory Peck, to give an example-although I don't think his performance was Oscar worthy)...but it was such a long way off from all it was said to be, it just turned out to be an overrated bore."
"To Kill a Mockingbird is pretty famous in my household. My mom loved Gregory Peck's portrayal of the integrity-filled, honest, caring, patient father so much that she named my brother Atticus. It was a running quotation when I was growing up to say, ""Do you know what a compromise is?"" with a little Southern drawl. I know my family is one of millions who have tried to emulate Gregory Peck's clipped pronunciation of ""Scout""; that one word is another one of our famous and long-running movie quotations.Unfortunately, there's nothing more American than racism, and in this adaptation of one of the most iconic American novels, lawyer Atticus Finch defends a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Since it's the South, you can only imagine the backlash he and his family receive from the community when he steps up to give Tom Robinson his right to a fair trial. As in the novel, the story is told from the point of view of Scout, Atticus's young daughter. Mary Badham plays Scout, and she's not only adorable, but completely earned her Oscar nomination. She was only ten years old, and the youngest actress to be nominated at that time! To Kill a Mockingbird marks Gregory Peck's most famous role, and while everyone knows the famous ""In the name of God"" powerful courtroom speech, his performance isn't just a ""Gregory Peck role"". He's a caring, concerned father, and the scenes between Greg and Mary are beautiful. Greg won an Oscar for his performance, and the film also picked up statues for Adapted Screenplay and Art Direction. Elmer Bernstein's lovely theme was nominated, but it was hard to compete against Laurence of Arabia, which took the music, director, and picture awards away from To Kill a Mockingbird. This is a real American classic, so if you're that one person in the country who hasn't yet seen it, rent it so you can join in the conversation with all your family and friends. Even if you're particularly attached to the novel and don't generally like film adaptations, give it a chance. Harper Lee herself loved the movie and thought Gregory Peck's performance was so wonderful, she gave him her father's (the real Atticus Finch) pocket watch. Peck's grandson is named Harper, which is really sweet, and it shows just how much this role and film meant to him and his family."
"I suggest you read the novel. You can get used books so cheap, anywhere online or in a local bookstore. They need the support. And this book is great. It was the first one I had picked up just for recreational reading after not having done that in a while. I think it is a really important read, and now more relevant than it probably has been for a while, which says less about the novel and more about the times we live in. It is short and written beautifully. So no excuse. But if you're reading this because you're in the mood to watch some old black and white movie and can't decide, I'd recommend La battaglia di Algeri or 12 Angry Men, which are superior movies in my opinion. As for this one, I say read the novel first, then watch the movie. It's good."
"I remember reading the source material for the movie, the Putizer Reward book of the same name by Harper Ferry when in middle school. The film removes a few sub-plots, but still, very faithful to the book. It's still long with a few boring moments, but whenever, the character of Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) got on screen, it was a joy to watch. This is Peck's best role. A lot of people might remember, this film for the court-room drama, as Atticus Finch find himself defending a black man, Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) accused of rape, but the movie directed by Robert Mulligan and written by Horton Foote; is also a coming to age story, teaching tolerance and decry prejudice. Without spoiling too much, the story covers three years of the 1930s, showing Jean Louise ""Scout"" Finch (Mary Badham) and her brother Jem (Phillip Alford), undergo big changes in their young lives. I like how Atticus Finch help them on the way, being a good father figure. As a Southern Gothic and a Bildungsroman, the primary themes of 'To Kill a Mockingbird' involve racial injustice and the destruction of innocence. You also see the movie dig deep into the issues of class, just/unjust laws, and Southern morals. A lot of woman believe it, touch on women's rights. I can see it. The patriarchal South does have a history that kinda made white men the dominant group, and women and blacks deemed in more subordinate roles. A lot of LGBT supporters believe that the book is gay or lesbian ""coming-of-age"" tale. Indeed, the movie dealt with gender roles in the American Deep South. Scout does acts more like a tom boy and show more a masculine side that feminine. She does not respond positively to anything girly, but it's really hard to prove that she is a closed lesbian or not due to the age. Scout hasn't reach adolescence yet. If Scout was based on Harper Lee's childhood, we still wouldn't know because Lee was an extremely private person and there is little information on her even in major biography databases. It's hard to prove, if Harper Lee is gay or not. Others people have look at this theory, by using Dill as an example, because Dill was supposed based on Harper Lee's childhood friend, the openly gay Truman Capote. While, there is no clear evidence supporting this, other than the fact that Capote was a childhood friend of Harper Lee. I really don't really know. After all, Lee, in turn, is the model for the Idabel character in Capote's first novel, 'Other Voices, Other Rooms,' which seem more like a heterosexual heroine. While, Dill and Scout seem to have a somewhat romantic relationship during childhood, who knows where their sexuality lies. A lot could change if a sequel to the book was ever written, which Harper Lee most likely, will not do. She hasn't wrote a book in years. This issue also brings the rumors of authorship. Some people believe it was written by Truman Capote; while others believe Harper Lee wrote Capote's best novel, In Cold Blood. Who knows? One thing for sure, is the plot is based on the unsuccessful legal defense by Harper Lee's attorney father, during the 1931 landmark Scottsboro Boys interracial rape case. The movie has a lot of heart & humor, despite dealing with dark themes. The film is widely considered to be one of the greatest films ever made. The film won three Academy Awards, including Best Actor for Peck. In 1995, To Kill a Mockingbird was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant'. Still, some people might hate this film. After all, it has a scene where Atticus shoots a mad dog. Some people see that scene, as he basically is a hypocrite, because he just killed a mockingbird; because Tim Johnson wasn't doing anything it was literally standing there. It wasn't charging at him or the kids. I can see where they are coming from, but the dog was suffering. I know PETA wouldn't like that, but it had a lot of symbolism with the dog scene. Perhaps, it's just one of examples of Atticus doing tough things he doesn't want to do. Is rabies supposed to represented racism? Atticus does refer to racism as ""Maycomb's usual disease."" In addition, while Atticus does not protect the children against racism, he does shoot down racism. Is the dog shooting, an allegory? Is it saying black people are dogs? Is the film saying it's alright to kill black people if they're suffering? Who knows? Maybe, I'm oversimplification it. Perhaps it's just the feeling Scout has. The sick horror at what's happening in front of her and how over complex, violent can be. Was this scene, needed? Maybe- not. Despite its good themes, To Kill a Mockingbird has been subject to campaigns for removal from public classrooms, often challenged for its use of racial epithets. The film does stereotyped blacks as superstitious, poor, and poorly education blacks who to some critics believe were ""contented slaves"". Some criticized the movie for focusing less on the blacks, and more on the story how honest, white man save them for racism. Surprising, there is some truth to that in the film, but the white savior narrative in film since this movie had indeed, went a little overboard. I didn't mind it, too much in this film. In recent years this idealization of Atticus Finch has been challenged. He is accused of having an élitist and paternalistic attitude towards his client and women, while some have asked how this ""father-knows-best"" could have so casually overlooked the Depression South's appalling record of racism, sexism and class exploitation. Still, there is no greater good guy than Atticus Finch in my opinion. Atticus Finch served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. Overall: It's a must watch."
"The book had alot of problems but this film really did. Notice how Atticus' children refer to him as Atticus. Not Dad, daddy. And here he's supposed to be this great father figure. Gregory Peck is really the ultimate male movie star. Handsome with a deep voice he basically never shows any emotion, smiles or gives at hint that he's trying to be the character in any movie he was in. Even here, he's the only one in a three piece suit that seems to have been tailored to him. In the courtroom scene although William Windom seems to be sweating and has his tie askew Peck looks like he just came out of the tailor. Also, why isn't the prosecuting attorney show to have a closing speech?
As to the charges, you'd really have to be a member to think this guy was guilty. We never get to see a jury selection. We never see how the children are friendly with the black reverend. I still wonder why this film isn't given as an example of the MeToo movement.
The only good acting in the film was by the black defendant, and the girl was supposedly raped. Everyone else was just stereotyped except Peck who couldn't manage a southern accent in the deep south. And when Scout speaks it's almost impossible to understand a word she's saying.
I'm just saying."
"​'TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD' - 1962Directed by Robert MulliganStarring Gregory Peck, Mary Badham and Phillip AlfordPlot Overview: ​Scout Finch (Mary Badham), 6,and her older brother, Jem (Phillip Alford), live in sleepy Maycomb, Ala., spending much of their time with their friend Dill (John Megna) and spying on their reclusive and mysterious neighbour, Boo Radley (Robert Duvall). When Atticus (Gregory Peck), their widowed father and a respected lawyer, defends a black man named Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) against fabricated rape charges, the trial and tangent events expose the children to evils of racism and stereotyping.This might be a movie that I am just not understanding in the slightest. It may genuinely be a testament of cinematic perfection. But, as it stands, I was immensely disappointed by this movie. Is it a poor movie? No. Not at all. In fact, there is a portion of this movie that could stand as one of the greatest 'Acts' in Film history. But the meat surrounding this Act was very lacklustre and poor for me. I am very sad to say that 'To Kill A Mockingbird' disappointed me.But what do I actually like about it? The portion between the first half and last 20 minutes was cinematic perfection. I am serious. I won't specifically say what happens but I will say that it is literally perfect. As for the film surrounding that part, that is a different story for me, but that does not detract from the masterful film making shown my the actors and Mulligan during that sweet, sweet 40 or so minutes.I also loved Gregory Peck in this film. He delivers a heartfelt, slow and meaningful performance as Articus. You can really see a passion and intelligence lurking beneath his calm, steady and articulate demeanour. Peck well and truly deserved his Oscar for this outstanding performance.Brock Peters was also incredible in his, unfortunately, minute role as Tom Robinson. Peters and the writers do excellent jobs in creating sympathy for this character and truly showing the injustice of the situation he finds himself in. I was very disappointed that he did not at least receive an Oscar nomination for this role; it was truly excellent. Phillip Aldford was good as Jem. The character wasn't exactly likable or interesting but I do admire their attempt at giving him an arc. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about Mary Badham's Scout for me. It baffles me as to how she earned an Oscar Nomination because I found her performance to be bland and very poor. And Scout as a character was also very disappointing. I mean, she wasn't likable, interesting and I fail to see a true arc for her. Another flaw that I have with this film is the very mediocre beginning and end. The middle is, as stated prior, true cinematic gold. The remainder of the film is a dull, bland, uninteresting, monotonous mess. I fail to see the brilliance in it and, while the message of the film is strong and prosperous, the execution of it was not. Then there is the very annoying ending. Maybe I am an idiot but I did not understand what was happening in the ending of this film. It was very confusing. I understand WHAT happened but I cannot fathom as to why. Perhaps my attention merely lapsed for those precious couple of seconds for the grand reveal but that doesn't change my distaste for it. That, and that man was absurdly creepy.In conclusion, I was unfortunately disappointed by 'To Kill A Mockingbird'. It's not a bad movie by any means, and when it gets it right, it gets it right. But the overall package did not live up to the expectations I had. It was a little over average and the middle on its own would achieve an easy 10/10. Despite that claim, the middle was the middle, and it had the beginning and end bogging it down. Do see this film, though. The message is very important and it features an impeccable middle and performance from Gregory Peck. Aside from that though, it was not that great. I'll rate 'To Kill A Mockingbird' 7 'Creepy Men in the Corner' out of 10."
"This movie is a very faithful retelling of the classic novel of the same name. Faithfulness seems to be one of the main goals of this film; Even though colored film was very possible in 1962, they intentionally chose to film the movie in black-and-white in order to capture the feel of the 1930s setting. It also does a good job at tackling the themes of racism and discrimination in a manner significantly less vulgar than you'd expect, though I'll avoid going into details to keep this relatively spoiler-free. Every aspect of the film is finely crafted. The child actors, despite their youth, do a great job at portraying their characters' emotions and stances changing throughout the film. The music intentionally plays primarily in scenes involving the children, whereas scenes focusing on grown-up Atticus have none to emphasize the essentially different world that the children and adults live in. The camera also uses a lot of low shots pointed upwards to emphasize how small the children are. It's a finely crafted film that allows you to pick up on different details every time you watch it."
Most of us remember having to read this book in high school but with the directing talents of Robert Mulligan and a fantastic cast this story of 1960s racial prejudice and childhood innocence is brought to life. The film accurately represents the feelings of the public of the time through the eyes of a child in a setting of racial unrest. The acting is as compelling as the story being told and its no wonder why both the book and film are considered classics to this day.
"I-like many others-had a requirement to read this novel during the course of my schooling. I loved the book and after seeing the film, my adoration fell deeper. This film is such a classic, and has so many teachings within. Definitely something that everyone should see. I have seen this film over and over again, and it is not one I will ever grow tired of."
"The most interesting part of this film in my opinion was the court scene. It didn't quite sit well with me, considering that the man was guilty after his lawyer proved his innocence. The obvious reason the man was seen to be guilty was based on his race. His lawyer basically got a confession that the woman lied about being raped, yet the court still found the man to be guilty. Like I said, this was an interesting scene to me, but it also didn't sit well with me. I hated how everyone in that room was so hateful of a man because of his race, that they chose to go along with a lying woman and her disgusting father. But luckily, the father died at the end of the movie, and I like how the lawyers daughter quoted something her father said towards the end of the film"
"Director Mulligan did a really good job of keeping true to the book of which this film is based, that was released only a short 2 years prior. Through brilliant framing, subjective pov, and long takes that often included monologues; this told and showed the story that has been a staple in America's history. It was highly culturally significant when it was penned, and it remains something that we look at today, because it dealt with more than just race, but also the stereotypes we place on people and how those are usually wrong (easily seen in Boo Radley's case). The film shows strength, cruelty, bravery in all of the everyday ways in which it as experienced, and that teaching doesn't end at with youth. That the student can just as easily learn, and then become the teacher. The best example is Atticus to his daughter Scout, who then speaks to Mr. Cunnighamn. She does so calmly and casually; she reminds him who he is when he isn't filled with hate and rage, and that her and her family are people just like him, reminding him that his son goes to school with her and of her father saying ""thank you"" after an act of surprise kindness he had done a while ago. She learns and grows throughout this experience, and is the vehicle through which the learning curve can be taught and seen to an audience that would have been conflicted during those times (the 1960s)."
