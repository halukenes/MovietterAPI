"The last 5 minutes of the movie explain everything. 2 things:1- The photo of his daughter and Jimmy. These 2 persons are these ones that he loves the most. It reminds him how he lost them both. Frank killed his best friend and he lost his daughter after she understood he did it.2- The door half open at 1 minute before the end. Jimmy used to let the door of his bedroom open because he trusted Frank. Frank broke the trust and as a result he could never talk to his daughter again. This door represent the trust, and show that trust must never be broken. Trust is even more important than love because without trust there can be no real love.Great movie, great actors, congratulations Mr Scorsese."
"When I love a movie as much as I loved The Irishman, I feel torn. On one hand, I want to review it and rave about it and try to convince others to see it. But then on the other hand, I realise that doing so could set expectations too high, which could then lead to some people getting disappointed (this happens a lot with horror movies that get hyped at film festivals and then rejected by disappointed wide audiences, like with The Witch, It Follows, and Hereditary).So that leaves me in a tricky situation, and I'll compromise by praising the film as much as I can without overhyping, whilst also making vague comments that won't be specific enough to ruin what the film has to offer (because yes: it's a Scorsese film. He has an incredibly varied filmography when you break down just what he's made over the last half-century, and so you're never going to get exactly what you'd expect).Okay, acting: phenomenal. Besides Goodfellas, Pesci's best performance ever. This is the best De Niro's been since Cape Fear. This is the best Al Pacino has been in at least three decades. These men are old, and all accomplished and wealthy enough to retire happily at this point, but thankfully they all agreed to not only star in this movie, but commit themselves 100%. No one's phoning it in here. While the supporting cast are uniformly solid, these three steal the show and I hope all get Oscar nominations come awards season.Scorsese, to no one's surprise, directs brilliantly throughout, making every scene purposeful and captivating. The movie is long, but deservedly so. The various pay-offs towards the film's conclusion would not hit nearly as hard if the film didn't spend so long building character, suspense, and emotion.As crude as it might sound, this movie- at about the halfway point- made me forget how badly I needed to use the theatre's restroom. At a certain point, I accepted that I couldn't miss a second, and leaving the room for even a moment was totally out of the question.If you can see this at a cinema, and can handle three and a half hours without a toilet or snack break (no intermission!), then by all means, watch it on a big screen, because it's beautiful and ultimately the best way to experience a film of this scope and spectacle. But it'll be on Netflix soon, and perhaps some would prefer to watch it in the comfort of their own home, where snack/toilet breaks are possible.Whatever you do, make sure you ultimately watch it. Films like this don't come around too often, and this is such a perfect swan-song for this talented group that I doubt we'll see these legends together again.It's bittersweet, but if this is Scorsese's, De Niro's, Pacino's and Pesci's farewell to the crime genre, then it's an amazing note to go out on."
"I don't know where to start on this one other than thanking Netflix for being the only distributor to fund this movie so we could see Big screen legends take their last big swing. The set and screen is smaller than I liked it to be, it being released on a streaming site but it's better than never seeing it.It's not a flawless movie and I wouldn't necessarily call it a masterpiece or something new and innovative. But for an old genre gangsta flick it's easily one of the best ones out there.The plot is a lot like Godfather 2 from De Niros perspective but that's all there is. It is more grounded and far too subtle compared to Goodfellas. And that's a good thing considering the age of the lead actors in the movie. But that doesn't mean its dull, gray and dreary because it isn't. It is surprisingly humorous, has some very serious scenes and doesn't shy away from giving us a blast of nostalgia every now and then.The cinematography is quite different from the usual modern movies we are accustomed to. It doesn't have an overabundance of Wes Anderson symmetric shots or Roger Deakins like Wide angle shots. The film was shot in a very old timey way with the camera pans and edits. The editing in the movie is great and the score is fitting. Technical aspects considered it isn't innovative or something jawdropping, but that was never supposed to be the main focus of the movie.The main focus for me was absolutely the acting. And why wouldn't it be with a cast like this? Al Pacino and Robert De Niro for the 1st time on screen together since Heat. Joe Pesci and De Niro since Goodfellas. Joe Pesci coming out of retirement and Martin Scorsese directing all these legends on screen together! If this doesn't get you excited for this film then I'm afraid nothing will.Speaking of acting my god do they act! Robert De Niro gives his best performance in his older age with this. Joaquin Phoenix was a top contender for best Actor Oscar and I agreed with that but after watching THE IRISHMAN everything changed. Robert De Niro basically steals his Oscar like a gangsta and gives the best performance of the year so far. Old Bobby here still giving top notch actors a run for their money and the guy is 76 years old!When was the last time you saw Al Pacino give a really good performance? Well that's exactly what he does here and it feels so good to see him find his glory days. He is his usual shouty self but shines better when he tones it down and let expressions speak.And boy have I missed Joe Pesci over the years and don't worry he's still intense as usual. And that's weird considering he is extremely toned down in this movie. If you're looking for a violent Joe Pesci like he was in Goodfellas you'll be disappointed. But if you're looking for an intimidating Pesci with a huge presence then you're in the right place.Harvey Keitel is in the movie for a very short time but he did his job fantastically. Ray Romano was a surprising standout and I can't believe how he kept up on the same plane as some of these industry legends. He doesn't really have a bigger role and basically gets lost as the film progresses but he made the most of his screentime.The film is 3hours and 30 minutes long but it never felt that long honestly. The first 2 hours went by a breeze but the 3rd hour was unapologetically slow. It felt a bit dragged on during the final hour and felt it was skipping ahead at the same time. it wasn't boring in any way but felt it could've been handled better. The CGI de-aging is so good that after a while you get confused how old the lead actors actually are. This is the best de-aging tech I've ever seen honestly.Despite it being slow in the latter end it still is a fantastic film. It doesn't set out to do something different, it doesn't try to set it aside from the herd. Scorsese did what he does best and made the movie he wanted to make. Its more of a last big hurrah for these living legends than something out to be a flawless masterpiece. It will most likely be the last of its kind and also the last collaboration of Scorsese with these acting legends. Considering the time we are in this might as well be the last Scorsese film, it most definitely is the last Joe Pesci appearance in a movie and the last good mobster hit with genre legends like Al Pacino and De Niro. So enjoy it while you can and savor it. Remember this movie 10 years from now and rejoice that you were alive to witness something truly fantastic. THE IRISHMAN is a farewell for most of these legends and a loveletter to the genre. It's the last of its kind and it went out in true mobster style."
"I was able to attend the NYC premiere this afternoon. Now that I've gotten over the shock of seeing so many celebrities, I'm able to happily to say that this movie, while being quite long, deserves to be remembered as one of Scorsese's great films.The Irishman reminds me a bit of Tarantino's recent hit Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood, both because it's a period piece and also because you need to know a little history to understand the direction of the narrative. The movie, while following Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) as the titular character, revolves around Teamsters union boss James Riddle Hoffa (played with intense and hilarious fervor by Al Pacino). Fortunately Frank goes to great lengths to narrate the story for the audience and provides a healthy dose of context for those of us not from the Kennedy era. The main thing you need to know going in is that Jimmy Hoffa had mob ties, and that he vanished in 1975 and was presumed murdered by mob bosses for being ""uncooperative"".The movie unfolds over four acts, told over several decades by Frank Sheeran. In act one, Frank is introduced as a WWII veteran who is stuck driving food delivery trucks in and around Philadelphia. He has the bright idea to steal some of the steaks that he's delivering, and sell them to local mobster Felix ""Skinny Razor"" DiTullio (Bobby Cannavale). Eventually his brazen willingness to break the law catches the eye of Italian mob boss Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci), who happens to be a mobster on a national level. His calm demeanor is both comical yet terrifying. A soon to be classic line encompasses Bufalino perfectly: ""You might be demonstrating a failure to show appreciation."" Under his mentorship, Frank becomes a ruthless action man for the italian mob and explains with rather entertaining dispassion how he does his job properly. In act two, Russell introduces Frank to Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), the outspoken and fearless president of the National Teamsters Union. Their relationship grows and Hoffa becomes Frank's second mentor. Together they use intimidation and bribery to gain influence until the election of John Kennedy, who subsequently appoints his brother Bobby Kennedy as Attorney General and immediately goes after Hoffa.The first two and a half hours are the most fun, and in particular the end of act three is some of the most tense and dramatic storytelling that I have had the pleasure of seeing in recent memory. At a dinner celebration for Frank (who eventually becomes a Teamster boss himself), tensions between Hoffa, Bufalino and the other mobsters reaches a breaking point, and the decision is made to make Hoffa disappear. But in a gut wrenching twist, Frank is the one tasked to do the job. In a beautiful display of cinematography over a thirty-minute buildup, Scorsese forces the viewer to the edge of their seats with the dread of what's about to happen. Robert De Niro's performance in these moments is master class; the inner conflict is all the more apparent thanks all of the time we spent watching Frank being raised by Bufalino and Hoffa in equal measure. I plan to watch this part of the film again, probably with a notepad.Getting away from the plot a bit, the movie is actually surprisingly funny. In one particular scene, someone insults an older Bufalino at a dinner reception. He and Frank exchange glances, and the frame suddenly cuts to a hotel bed covered in guns. Frank then narrates with excess detail and hilarious dispassion the ideal weapon for a public assassination. Moments like these are littered throughout the film and keep it from getting too bogged down in it's violence. It's impressive how quickly jokes fly, given the disproportionate amount of people getting shot point blank in the head. But anyone who has seen Scorsese's Goodfellas or The Departed will feel right at home.The heart of the movie is definitely Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci. De Niro was de-aged with apparently exorbitantly priced CGI, as he is supposed to be younger than both Pacino and Pesci. While it's fairly obvious, I was never too distracted to not enjoy what was unfolding onscreen. Plus he's kind of made a career of holding one scowling facial expression, so that probably was a little easier to edit. Al Pacino is a riot as Hoffa, and is certainly one of the most arrogant, over-the-top characters that Pacino has played in awhile. Pesci as Bufalino is chilling, and it's fun to seem him as the boss in this gangster movie after being a junior-level mobster in Goodfellas so many years ago. The mentorship between De Niro's character and both Pacino and Pesci is amazingly entertaining.The only thing keeping me from calling this movie perfect is it's length. Three hours and (almost) thirty minutes is a very long time, and while occurring infrequently the movie does drag a bit. This is most apparent in the fourth act where Frank introspects during his final years, and attempts to achieve reconciliation for all the murders he's committed. It doesn't really offer any closure or seem necessary to wrapping up the narrative.Ultimately that doesn't even come close to making me not recommend seeing The Irishman. There's a reason Martin Scorsese will forever be known for his gangster movies. Combining comedy, violence, brotherhood and drama, he has created a formula that continues to work. The fact that he continues to make excellent movies at 76 years old blows my mind. Well done."
"""What kind of a man makes a phone call like that!""
It Happened!
I've watched it!
Quite simply, The Best Film of the Year!
No, of the Last 3 Years!
The hype is real, set your expectations as high as you can possibly reach!Let me tell you something, I'm 25 years old and I didn't really got the chance to live the era of Masterpieces, I didn't see Raging Bull/Goodfellas/Dog Day Afternoon at its time, I didn't experience how its like to watch the best actors of all time in their fully artistic command.
The first time I've watched Raging Bull I truly envied those people who lived in the 80s, I was always wishing if time can just go back and see De Niro's rage or hear Pacino's Attica once in a theater! But guess what, It happened!This is the end of the era! The summation of Scorsese/De Niro/Pesci/ Pacino career, a final statement by masters!
Robert De Niro is EXPLOSIVE! sorry but no chance for Joaquin Phoenix this year for a win!
Pacino/Pesci are unexpectedly MARVELOUS!
Scorsese's second Oscar, it's officially!
Zaillian's screenplay is on point, you can't go wrong with him.
A 3.5 hour film without a single dragging minute, a poem of friendship, betrayal, regret and time!"
"Sadly a sub-par effort from one of my all time favorite directors. The story is weak (by Scorsese standard) and overly stretched. I can understand the appeal to revisit his trademark Italian gangster genre one more time, but this one feels unnecessary. The also trademark Scorsese humor is in-existent (except for the painting walls bit). De Niro looks disoriented, in the worst physical (hunched over almost the whole movie) and acting shape ever and out of place. Not very surprising, either. He spent the better part of the last 15 to 20 years doing mock impressions of himself which after the novelty faded ended him up in a series of quite dubious productions. That's a very long time to lower the bar and obviously takes its toll.The De-aging technique is unconvincing when the actors move. Their faces look animated, fake. There is little and uninspired music. Keitel looks fantastic but is underused. Pacino kinda overacts on occasion. Pesci looks fantastic and is in top form acting-wise but he's also in a supporting role (he's the best part of the movie) so he doesn't have a big impact on the movie. Romano is in top form but his part is also small.The movie is slow, linear, extremely long, predictable (how often have we seen the Hoffa story on screen? a superior version starring Nicholson comes to mind) and dull. There isn't much going on action-wise. A lot of innuendo and he said they said, but aside some quite dull hit-jobs where de Niro is supposed to be in his prime but moves like a 75 year old the story is quite static. The dialog is stale. Stunts are weak to say the least (Pacino's double excessively hiding his face when he hits the floor in a fight and obviously wearing a wig and body padding, and the store owner more than obviously throwing himself through the window of the store while De Niro clumsily mimics hitting him around come to mind, rendering those scenes borderline laughable). Colors, interiors, costumes are all in shades of beige. Camera work is rigid. Plus the Hoffa story is old news to begin with, there are so many insane things going on right now and would translate better to the screen in 2019. The edgy fast paced crazy energy of the more recent Wolf of Wall Street (not to mention his earlier masterpieces Casino, Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, Mean Streets or Goodfellas etc) seems that of a different director.All in all the weakest film in Scorsese's portfolio and not above a 6 stars out of 10 by any standard (I'm inclined to be lenient mainly because he managed to bring Pesci out of retirement for this. But by Scorsese standard it's well below that). It's more of a self-indulgent piece of nostalgia best left unmentioned when it's all said and done. And I'm hopeful that Marty will surprise us with more of his best work in the future and we can sweep this one under the rug."
"While this is De Niro's best performance in years, and it's great to see Pesci back on screen, this film is strangely subdued and slow, and not half as entertaining or engrossing as either Goodfellas or Casino were. Unfortunately, this films seems to reflect a Scorsese who is aging, or perhaps the fault lies with the freedom that Netflix gave him, when a lot of editing could have been done to tighten this film up. Even if you're watching this on Netflix in say 3 x 70 minute sessions, not much really happens in this time to make it compelling enough to want to stay till the end. It's a strange film because it bares the distinct marks and style of a Scorsese film but is nowhere near as memorable as Taxi Driver, Raging Bull or The Departed (and perhaps Di Caprio and Damon would have been a better fit, rather than de-aging the actors via CGI). It could also be that the script just isn't as good as most of his previous films. I can't recommend this to many of my friends as I know they simply won't sit through this, unless they are hardcore De Niro or Scorsese fans."
"This film is super long. Too long to sit in the cinema for as fantastic as it looks. I ran out of snacks, I was so gripped I didn't go to the toilet which meant my bladder was bursting only adding to the tension.This is pretty much the Avengers of the gangster movies where all of your favourite people are in one film written by the best writer and directed by the best director. Only Walken and Woods are missing.Making de niro young kind of works and isn't as distracting as I thought and Pacino is fantastic. If you expect Pesci to be the nutjob he was in the other Scorsese movies then think again and this is no bad thing. Pesci is one of the best actors alive with a fantastic range and this movie proves it.The Irishman is lovely to look at but for god sakes take a leak before you go or wait for its Netflix debut where you can watch it with whiskey and pause it for comfort breaks."
"If your one of those people thinking about getting Netflix just so you can see this dinosaur, please don't.
Watching Robert DeNero in this film is almost sad. He plays the part of a guy in his prime, but the CGI face doesn't work. It looks animated at times and his body moves like a very old man ... even for DeNero's age of mid 70's.
The grocery sceen where DeNero beats up the store owner is just embarrassing to watch.
Joe Pesci comes out of retirement for this one and shines. He has a stare that burns a hole through you.
Al Pacino as the flamboyant Jimmy Hoffa works well.
Harvey's Keitel in a small mob boss roll is solid too.
But the editing is not together ... the movis drags ... and the fellas in the film unfortunately are just too old to pull this off convincingly.
It's too bad this wasn't made 25 years ago, it would have probably worked.
Grossly overhyped epic that is passed its prime, in more than one way.
Would never waste 3.5 hrs watching again.
If your hoping for the next Goodfellas, you've come to the wrong place."
"The movie stars bold, we get some nice action, a somewhat of a storytelling and trying to ignore weird looking CGI on DeNiro's face.But what happens later, oh man.....When i saw this 76 year old men ""beating up"" the guy in diner for touching his daughter, with moves like grandpa, clumsy and unnatural i left my pink glasses and really started to pay attention to details.Aside from Pacino's acting, and best CGI looking effect as far as i'm concerned, the movie after 1,5 hrs becomes dull and stretched.Would have been much much much better to have had youngsters for half of the movie so it doesn't ruin the experience afterwards as we're looking to the same faces that's supposed to tell a story of a 30 years timeline and so.And i could have lived with that if it wasn't the bad screenplay....I was so anxious to see a movie with all my favorite actors and got to the conclusion that in life it's better to go down in grace than disgraced."
"First off, let me set this straight that I'm not repeled by long or slow films. However, The Irishman is at the very least 30-40 minutes too long, and the suspense sometimes is killed off by characters dragging the scene too much. The biggest offender would be the second last arc which I'm not gonna spoil.Secondly, for such a slow film you'd expect the pay off to be worth it, but it isn't. The message of the film is revealed very early on, and it's very obvious where this particular plot line is going to. These 2 factors (slow pace and obvious plotline) make the film feels particularly unrewarding to me.Third is the lack of the 'wow' factor, which is disappointing for such a godlike cast and crew. There is not a single memorable scene or line that stands out for me, despite the actors all doing a phenomenal job. And no, I don't really mind the CGI, even though it's not the best thing since sliced bread. The music is not memorable either, even though it can be an artistic choice to make the film feels more grounded and unglamorous.So where does this leave us? Personally I don't think this is a bad film, but it feels disappointing with such a big roster. Don't expect this to be the film to watch with friends over, as it's pretty (unneccessarily) lengthy and the undertone is meant to be a heavy one."
"Watching the wax museum version of De Niro for more than three hours wasn't the blast I hoped for. The CGI is not there yet. Dead eyes. Very distracting.Al Pacino pretty much tries to play Al Pacino, De Niro his usual bitter self, but nice to see wax-Pesci, who was the most believable character. He completely outshines wax-De Niro here.Oh, and by the way, Scorsese: there were no twin towers in the late 60's.I can rewatch 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino' over and over again. I will not be returning to 'The Irishman'"
"Classic Scorsese . De Niro is the best he's been for years . Pacino is really magnetic and charming . But for me, Joe Pesci is the standout. Quietly deadly, magnetic , loyal, complicated, its him that will get the Oscar . Saw it at the cinema ( sorry Netflix but I am not watching Scorsese at home ) and it was superb.
Oh Anna Paquin is used quite cleverly as well. Good actress . Decent performance
Go and see it at the cinema . You will remember the masters returning for one last ride"
"Peoples are losing their minds over the sainted director, forgetting the movie. Sure, it's well made, fascinating history. But it's second nature for De Niro, and Pacino overreaches at times. The third reel is repetitive over the decline of the De Niro character. Would be a better movie at 2hr 30. In fact, I thought it had ended about then, but it meandered on another hour."
"I love Scorsese's films, but this was one, is just one too many. It lacked tight editing, scenes lingered far too long to make artistic points. The technology of that allowed the actors to be made younger was not impressive given the actors could not move as if they were younger. The one scene that made this point, was when De Niro's character roughs up a corner grocer for shoving his daughter. The scene is difficult to watch given De Niro seemed to struggle as much with his own lack of mobility to carry off the fight scene realistically despite having the willing and compliant younger actor. Al Pacino's character looked nothing like Hoffa. Yes the acting was good in general, but the story was just too drawn out and slow and the characters were just not that interesting to hold your attention. As a man of 58, the hardest fact is recognizing the increasing limitation as we age, this movie opens with De Niro's character in an assisted care facility. It is where this movie should have stayed. The Actors and Directors are all legends, but this movie only took away from some of their carrier luster."
"I cannot fathom two things: how this movie cost so much to produce, and why they wasted so much money doing so. This movie like watching a documentary about a political campaign that never ends. Seriously, save yourself 3 hours of the most boring and monotonous mash up ever. There is virtually no action or incentive to keep watching. It's 90% people talking at tables with lines like ""Who said that?! oh he said that?!"" or ""Ok, well you talk to him Frank!"" and then Frank talks to him, and then Frank talks to the other guys, and then Frank talks to him, and rinse and repeat. Occasionally a few seconds are spared for shooting someone in the head and then that's it. You are constantly left searching for a reason to keep watching, but it never comes.The acting is not even that good either. With the exception of De Niro and Joe Pesci, it seemed a little awkward. Al Pacino walks, talks and acts funny. They may have de-aged faces but the postures are very out of sync with their ages for almost all the actors. There was a scene where De Niro beats up a grocery guy that looked more like a rehearsal rather than an actual scene. I'm shocked they let it pass. I only laughed at one scene that had to do with ears and that's it (which is why I give this 2 stars instead of 1).I also gotta say that the ending was so anti-climactic and long-winded that after the movie I seriously sat there for a moment and contemplated why I wasted all this time on this hyped up monstrosity. Everyone claiming this is a masterpiece is either paid to say so or are saying so because of all the fancy names attached to this title. Or maybe they think they're being hip acting like this was worth a damn, I don't know. What I do know is that this is a complete disaster of a film and a waste of your valuable time."
"The De-aging effect in the first half of the movie was very distracting and not really hiding well the old age of the main cast. Deniro, Pacino and Pesci all move and talk like old people...perhaps because they are old and some cgi can't fully hide that fact. The 2nd half of the movie on the other hand felt much more natural as the characters got older (no more distracting de-aging effect) and both the story and direction became A class. Scorsese did a great job creating tension and everyone else involved (actors, camera work etc.) gave their best.
If only this movie was made 20 years ago I'm sure it would have become a classic masterpiece without this annoying de-aging effect. As it is, this is a flawed masterpiece at best."
"Few years took for this film to arrive, Don't Believe tha Hype, this ain't no classic. Slow burn, with the last part sending me to sleep. Actors old made to look young and young-ish actor made to look old, De Niros dodgy contact lenses, also the way he beats up the greengrocer that was comical, looked like a 90 year old man dishing out a lame beating, notice his foot stamp with the opposite foot an nothing being under it hahahaa, Stephen Graham's accent dodgy. Years for this pffftttt."
I'm going to steal something I read from a food critic once-this deserves a zero because it's so good it'll ruin everything else for you. And that's what this masterpiece is to cinema. It's truly just that effing special. It reminded me just how much I miss Pesci. Never in my life has time flown by as quickly as it did watching this. A true joy and a privilege to witness. Well done sirs. Well done.
"The netflix trolls are strong with this one. The movie is plain boring. I literally fell asleep watching it. The actors are supposedly rejuvenated with cgi yet still look as the old farts they actually are what results in ridiculous dialogue for example Joe Pesci's character ""Russel"" is calling De Niro a kid like if he would be a young man. The story is boring lacking any build up or creating any tension what results in a very dull resolution of the movie. I can't believe it's from the same director that made great movies like ""Casino"" and ""Cape Fear.""
This movie isn't worth a long review. I fell the need to warn people not to get fooled like I did by the high rating this movie has.
I would give this movie a 4/10 but since the movie is overrated by fake reviews from netflix trolls I decided to give it the lowest rating possible to help to the contribution of balancing out the rating a little bit."
"Remember Bugsy Malone? That gangster film where all the characters were kids?Well, The Irishman is a gangster film where all the characters are geriatrics. At the start of the film, De Niro's CGI youthened character still looked like he's 50. They all do. They're old, fat, hunched, liver-spotted killers, even when they're supposedly young(er). It's weird.The film just drags on and on and never really gets going. The plot is disjointed and never really tells a story or builds a narrative. Unlike Scorsese's classics like Casino or Goodfellas, this film really struggles to develop a story worth watching.3.5 hours. $160M budget. Good Lord. At least this rubbish will be 'free' on Netflix soon. There's a reason no one else wanted it - it wasn't going to make any money at the cinema. Even the $13 you pay for Netflix is too much for this film."
"Is it just me, or is Robert DeNiro once again portraying the mindless and aging FBI honcho Robert Mueller from SNL fame in this lengthy biographical film????? He sure runs like a 76 year old man so why no stunt double for DeNiro?Pacino isn't playing Jimmy Hoffa. Every time he opens his loud mouth, Al Pacino is just playing himself. In fact a VERY OLD looking 79 year old over-the-hill version of Al Pacino. Sad. Terribly sad. Jimmy Hoffa is rolling over in his grave or he is breaking through 20 tons of concrete to stop a has been like Pacino ruin his reputation.Mrs. Shullivan and I were anticipating another long awaited Martin Scorsese 1960's-1970's period masterpiece crime film, but instead what we disappointedly sat through was an over-hyped, (too) lengthy quasi biography on just one of the many here say storylines on the 1975 sudden and mysterious disappearance of former union Teamster President Jimmy Hoffa.This film version of the missing Jimmy Hoffa focuses on three main characters, Hoffa played by Al Pacino, mob boss Russell Bufalino played by Joe Pesci, and the underling stuck in the middle of Hoffa and Bufalino, teamster labour leader Frank Sheeran, played by Robert DeNiro.THE GOOD:
Make no mistake, without actor Joe Pesci's strong but silent type mobster boss performance this film would have been most likely rated nothing more than a Grade B film with more than half of the finished product still sitting on the cutting room floor. Unlike the previous Scorsese directed mob films where Joe Pesci plays a raging out of control mobster maniac, in this biographical film Pesci plays a silent, very controlled, smart and resourceful mobster fixer who doesn't say much, but when he does, you better listen. I felt Pesci's strong performance and especially his one-on-one interactions with his underling Frank Sheeran kept the flame from going out on this otherwise forgettable and over rated film. Pesci played a similar role (crime boss) in the 1993 film, one of my all time favorite crime films, ""A Bronx Tale"", which also co-starred Robert DeNiro and Chazz Palminteri.THE BAD:
Why did Scorsese have the now 76 year old DeNiro and the now 79 year old Pacino play their respective characters Frank Sheeran (DeNiro) and Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino) from their early days in the 1960's through to the year Sheeran actually died of cancer in 2003? The film would have transitioned much better through the five (5) decades of this biographical story line if two different actors had played a younger version of Frank Sheeran and Jimmy Hoffa. Off the top of my head I could see Milo Ventimiglia playing the younger Frank Sheeran and Michael Chiklis playing the younger Jimmy Hoffa during the 1960's scenes and then transitioning to the (past their freshness date) Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino playing the much older versions of their characters.THE UGLY:
The film it's way too loooooong and boring. I understand that NetFlix has to fill in 24 hours per day for their millions of subscribers but to just fill in with extended and continuous chatty scenes that were just wasted minutes as were the smoke breaks alongside the highways and motels, ENOUGH ALREADY!Sadly, I rate it a dismal 5 out of 10. Badda Bing! Badda BUST!"
"I guess the Hollywood people are so used to seeing 80 y/os with dyed dark hair and lots of plastic surgery, but us little people in Flyover country aren't
It's kinda pathetic seeing an old DeNiro beating up a guy and acting the tough guy. The energy from all of the actors isn't there. It doesn't work at all for me."
"Clearly you either think this film is a masterpiece, or an overlong slow-moving indulgence. I am afraid I am in the second camp. Having rewatched the Godfather recently, perhaps my expectations were too high. No way is it in the same league."
"Well, that was awful. If this excruciatingly long, pointless, meandering mess wasn't a Scorsese film and didn't include a famous, though ancient, cast, it would be getting universally panned. Seriously, what was the point? Three and a half hours of watching old men try to act like a bunch of bad-asses and I still don't get the point. That's three and a half hours I'll never get back."
"The CGI faces create a soulless effect. It never feels like a real film, just a digital recreation where computerized characters are pretending to be DeNiro, Pacino and Pesci. They basically robbed us of the reunion by experimenting with a technique that fails so badly we know never to do that. The tragedy is this was not a time to experiment. They hang the entire picture on the believability of the de-aging, and it doesn't work for a second. It's egregious, bizarre, and will age horribly for the simple reason it's not registering as acting because computer programmers are doing the acting via mouseclicks. For Marty, a purest of cinema, to have this little respect for the purity of performance marks this as hypocrisy how he trashes blockbuster film. This is the theme park ride. This is a greatest hits tour through his oeuvre. This is uncanny directorial valley. I'm certain in 2050, you would get these old actors recreated exactly like this. That is our soulless future. Why rush to it? And the sad thing is, the cast were all there, and we will never get to see what they did. Clearly everyone is in denial and reviewing Scorsese's other works and pretending the emperor's wardrobe is just wonderful. When critics talk about the last half hour being a conscientious meditative coda on the gangster epic? Well sure, because they finally showed him acting. And it's not just that the CGI sinks the film, it's that it calls the entire thing into question and demands every other area perfect to make up for it, and can you honestly say the script and story is matching the perception of these rave reviews?"
"All right look. I enjoy watching the occasional films and shows about mob/gangster activity once in a while. I know that these are all subhuman scumbags that deserve nothing but contempt. But it is entertaining enough. The Departed, Casino, Goodfellas, Hoffa, The Godfather films, Blood in Blood Out. I enjoy the early Bogart and Cagney movies as well. Edmond O'Brien was a favorite of mine too. Sigh... then there is this.. this three and a half hour THING..Putting aside the ridiculous CGI that looked like nothing but a bunch of gratuitous botox injections, this film sucked in virtually every aspect besides production. 165 million for THIS??? De Niro and Pacino played themselves yet again (is there a record for doing this sort of thing?) The script was soooooo poor. My God! How many times can these characters go back and forth while saying THE SAME THING AND NOT PROGRESSING THE PLOT! Was there a plot?? De Niro must be the most overrated actor in recent memory. The scene where he stomps on a grocer's hand had me in tears. He looked like a geriatric who was desperately trying not to lose his balance. Scorsese is definitely partially to blame for this. How that entire scene did not fall to the cutting room floor is beyond me. De Niro has the same acting style since the 80s. Eyebrows up, corners of the mouth up. Eyebrows up, corners of the mouth down. Then he lowers his eyebrows and does the same thing. He laughs the same way as well. This is acting? I already mentioned that Pacino was Pacino in this. Good God was he ever. He was 100% Pacino and 0% Hoffa which equates to PaSTINKO! Aren't these actors supposed to actually TRY to be like the characters they are portraying? Hoffa was a real person. There is plenty of footage of the man talking, interviews, etc. What were Pacino and Scorsese thinking? Scorsese just lets Pacino HAM it up scene after scene after scene. Pacino is another actor who I find overrated as hell. He did some decent work in the 70s but he has also coasted since And Justice For All. The man just yells and looks bizarrely awkward while doing it. Staring off into space while bug eyed. Three and a half hours of this. Boring scenes, boring dialogue ""Did you talk to him? He did that? Talk to him again. Set up a meeting. You think so? Yeah. I dunno. You really think so? I dunno. Lets think about it. I thought about it. Really? Yeah. I think so."" And on.. and on.. and on.... Was Scorsese on a mission to murder the Mob genre with this? These cats need to retire. Just call it a career.. Quite honestly this was extremely painful to sit through. I had to break this thing up into three parts. This film offers nothing but a bunch of boring scenes and an awkward geriatric clown trying to pass himself off as Jimmy Hoffa. Shame on you Marty. You let this happen.Hoffa was done already. Danny De Vito directed Jack Nicholson in 1992. You want a real glimpse of how Hoffa actually talked and acted like? Watch that instead. Why was the Irishman even made? The answer is anybody's guess. AVOID AVOID AVOID... unless you need to get a good nap in immediately."
"Martin Scorsese's The Irishman is a magisterial mob epic...this movie is reflective more about greatness and losses. Finally Scorsese has brought the lost charm of gangster movies after so many years...but don't expect that this movie is treated with the same manner of Goodfellas..and the violence in this movie is not as extreme compared to his other movies in this genre, it's mainly focuses on the relation between Frank Sheeran and his boss Jimmy Hoffa..more like I say this is the ultimate gratitude to mob or gangster genre from the greatest living director with his competency.Robert De Niro gave his best performance in years..Pacino is electric, hope he will get his long deserved 2nd Oscar..Joe Pesci is real deal, he is not the desperado like in his other movies, in it he is sharp-witted quite sensible guy...when you see on these guys on screen you see the true power of art..The other cast members are also great.The film's first 30 or 40 minutes may be felt slow by some people but from when Hoffa kicks in, there is no turning back..The Irishman is the best movie of the year for me so far and 2019 is going to be one of the greatest years in movie history."
"Other reviewers at the top, when sorted by Helpfulness, have already covered much of what makes this film so exceptionally good. As such, and knowing that I have a tendency to sometimes exceed the number of allowed characters, I'd like to add just a couple of small things.First, the sets and costuming were near perfection. Every SINGLE piece of clothing which the characters wore, down to cuff-links, handbags, hair pins and shoes were of the era. That kind of meticulous detail can only bode well for a film. If the creators care enough about the small details, imagine what they do with the big ones.Secondly, in many films now, where there is a well-known and varied cast, you find that the screen time each devotes in comparison to the film run time, really leaves a little to be desired. That is not the case here. Almost every second of every scene is filled with one or more of these masterful actors, actually acting. Performing. Pulling you in to the world they are creating. All, without the need of heavy CGI or filler. As Hoffa might say: they get right down to brass tacks - and, pardon the pun, deliver.DeNiro, Pacino, Pesci, Keitel. Enough said. Leave politics at the door, and enjoy.Excellent film all around."
"At this point I'm sure all these positive reviews are bots paid for. There's no other explanation. This movie is absolutely unwatchable. One of the dullest pieces of cinema ever made since... well, since Scorcese's Silence (2016). I honestly do not have the faintest idea how anybody can enjoy this crap. Am I in a parallel reality?"
"Just paid to watch this film and feel like I've been robbed by all the blatantly fake reviews on here.
I actually thought actors were supposed to pretend to be the characters they played? Especially as it was based on a true story.
Pacino was Pacino and De Niro was De Niro. Maybe these aged actors have become too big that now you only see them as themselves or maybe they are out of touch or too egotistical to try something different. It like eating plain cornflakes everyday of your life, if you've have had one bowl then you know what's coming. Also speaking of forever, it was like Scorsese was desperately trying to fill in the gaps with long drawn out scenes , the 30 mins of irrelevance at the end and menial tasks like standing in a queue being shown.
This film reminds me of watching your uncle get up to dance at a party thinking he's funny. It's been done a thousand times, everyone is bored and it lasts forever.
Self indulgent dross. If you feel like you have to watch which as a film fan you will, watch on Netflix over a week. Preferably at night do it can put you to sleep."
"Hands-down one of the most boring films ever made. An amazing achievement given the quality of the actors.Unless you enjoy watching the intricacies of union politics, don't bother watching it."
"A group of 70-something year olds trying to act tough. Watching De Niro's lame attempts at cleaning up the streets (roughing people up that are half his age) was as much a farce as his and Pacino's acting in this crap. The dialogue comes off as ""hey, what clever things can we say because the camera is on."" Nothing comes off natural here. You want Hoffa? Check out Nicholson in Hoffa which was directed by De Vito. This? Please. Scorsese attempts his best to polish a crap... we all know it can't be done. If you insist on seeing it, Pesci's character is good. His performance trumps the rest. Very much a letdown otherwise."
"I was worried about the length of the film before i attended the screening, but i can honestly say, i was gripped all the way through, De Niro back to his best, Pesci was fantastic, Pacino was electric, Keitel was menacing & Stephen Graham held his own amongst this legendary cast.A return to this world that Scorsese has mastered with some of his best films & this film sits right up there right next to them.Get comfy & enjoy the great story telling ability of these masters at work."
"If you were hoping for an other kind of Goodfellas, like me, well I have to tell you this one is a letdown. A three and half hour long letdown. The story is boring as hell and there's little to no character development. You just can't seem to care about what happens after an hour into the movie, because it's hard to sympathize with any of the uninteresting characters."
"Eighty year old men playing 25 to 60 year old men.
They walk and move like old men, plus it is a b.s. story.
Martin, you should have picked a different story for your reunion.
Other than that, nice cars."
"Too long, ageing effects are laughable in most of it and all the actors past their prime. Save yourself nearly 4 hours and rewatch Goodfellas instead"
"At an epic run-time of over three hours, you'd think director Martin Scorsese would make something more liken to an addictive limited cable series than an epic about absolutely nothing. It is, however, about someone, and that's Jimmy Hoffa played by a CGI-youthful Al Pacino, who, with Robert De Niro as sidekick ""house painter"" i.e. assassin Frank Sheeran, are involved in endless dialogue leading absolutely nowhere...Unlike Scorsese's mob classic GOODFELLAS, ironically playing-out like binge crime serials do now... with something to anticipate around every suspenseful corner... there's nothing to look forward to here except more and more conversations with De Niro on cruise control, and Pacino using a fake accent that's not only distracting but completely unnecessary.Narrated by a slightly more aged than he's already aged De Niro, rock-skipping through short, uneven portions of the past, the tech-rendered faces look somewhat young but the bodies are as stiff as genuine old fogies: like watching Redd Foxx as Fred Sanford wearing a 1930's-era James Cagney or Edward G. Robinson mask...Meanwhile, the continuous wrap-around section involves an afternoon drive with De Niro and Joe Pesci's powerful but overall pointless mobster Russell Bufalino, and there are a few new expository devices, perhaps to deviate from GOODFELLAS and CASINO: Like every mobster introduced with words flashing on the screen telling when and how they're eventually killed. It's not entirely clear why this happens other than to remind us who the movie's about, or that no one else actually matters...And yet, backed by the usual Scorsese jukebox of vintage rock/soul tunes while peppered with rushed bouts of ultra-violence, we learn even less about the doomed union leader than in Danny DeVito's limp Jack Nicholson as HOFFA biopic: proof that the man's legacy has nothing to do with his story, because he obviously doesn't have one worth telling, or watching."
"This movie dissapointed me. I don't know if it was cause I saw how many amazing reviews there were or the countless good things I heard about the editing. This movie is slow. I mean so slow I had to write my first review on IMDb. There were some beautiful scenes when it came to the dialogue I.e the fish scene but because the actors in this movie are so old they are not able to do anything else other than just sit in a room and talk. I would say 3 hours of this movie is just Talking heads and the other half hour of this movie is people getting shot in the head. Marty is my favorite director but I'm not going to sugar coat this movie like everyone else seems to be doing. There needed to be a lot more cut from the movie and I'm not just talking about plot there are ungodly pauses where the actors Bob/Joe/Al are just staring off into space. This movie takes slow burn to a whole new level, Tarkovsky would even feel like this movie is paced terribly because there was so much that didn't matter. You could actually cut the first 45 minutes of the movie and the rest of it would still make complete sense. I hope people don't regard this as one of his best movies because that would be an injustice to his legendary films that changed cinema."
"By the time we got to the wood chipper spewing out body bits, I had my metaphor for The Irishman - it was as if Scorsese had taken Goodfellas, Casino, Mean Streets, Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, and The Sopranos, put them all into an industrial sized shredder, and concocted this bloody blob of a film.
Long gone are the young Vito Corleone and Michael Corleone of Godfather II, (and the much ballyhooed ""de-aging"" effect doesn't bring them back.) But they are replaced by an Al Pacino who morphed into John Turturro and a Robert De Niro who has deteriorated into a sad parody of his former self. Who would have thought that Joe Pesci would be the shining star of this acting troika, but he has the one decent performance in this dreadful picture.
I didn't read the book the film is based on but the script is terrible. One example of many is Frank Sheeran's (De Niro in the title role) daughter character, played by Anna Paquin as an adult. She seems to be the only one of the four daughters and two wives who suspects that daddy may be a monster. Although she has hardly any lines, we can tell she hates him by the many repetitive scenes of her giving Frank death-ray stares. And it makes this cold-blooded killer feel really bad (calling Tony and Meadow Soprano! But at least Meadow had dialogue, a personality, and a nuanced relationship with her father.)
And speaking of dialogue, the various conversations between De Niro and Pacino (Jimmy Hoffa) and/or Pesci (a gangster whose name I've already forgotten) are beyond absurd in the nonsensical, elliptical way they speak as they keep putting out hits on their rivals.
While I'm passing out the raspberries, Robbie Robertson's musical score seems like it was written for another film entirely. But at least they used In the Still of the Night a couple of times and don't miss the short bit of Steve Van Zandt playing Jerry Vale singing Al di La in the mandatory night club scene.
And perhaps the final insult is that after three and a half hours of this mess, Frankie, we hardly knew ye."
Not one of Scorsese's best... needs to be edited down to two hours once director figures out what he is trying to accomplish with this movie.Great actors and cinematography but movie does not come together.
"Way too long and hardly worth the effort. Very much a less interesting tribute version of Goodfellas or Casino, sure it has good production values, with the exception of the de-aging that never looks too convincing. Acting is capable but never noteworthy or memorable and it genuinely feels like it should have been made in the mid to late 90's when De Niro and Pacino were at the top of their game, because there is an undeniable sense of limitation due to their age. The story is far from gripping and poorly paced, it never really raises any intrigue or interest surrounding the disappearance of Hoffa. I personally would recommend Danny De Vito's ""Hoffa"" starring Jack Nicholson, a far superior film about Jimmy Hoffa and his disappearance. It is understandable as to why this film spent so long in development and struggled to get produced and distributed."
"The Irishman is one of the best stories put to film in years. Al Pacino looked in his prime. De Niro Pesci and everyone else is as good as youd expect. The cgi deaging is revolutionary. Truly seamless. The 3.5 hour runtime is heavily felt, but totally worth it
To that, I say bravo to Marty Scorsese"
"The Irishman had much to offer but it was let down by the choice of actors. Their age was a problem, despite ""a custom three-camera rig and extensive digital de-aging visual effects (that) were used to make De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci appear younger in many of the film's flashbacks"". De Niro's age was particularly on display; he looked like a jittery old man not the young man who's daughter he was standing up for.This was less of an issue for Pacino and Pesci because their roles were different.Quite apart from age, I find it difficult now to watch a De Niro on film without seeing his foul-mouthed, disgusting anti-Trump rants. De Niro was once a great actor, but is it time to put him out to pasture?"
"Oh my good!!
Seriously??
This movie is a complete garbage and waste of time.
Acting of those so called great actors is just so wooden and boring.
Robert De Niro has always been boring, he always does the same acting where this movie once again shows nothing has changed.The only good thing in this movie is Joe Pesci."
"The Irishman is another outstanding Scorsese film. De Niro gives one of his best performances in years. His narration is spot on and he makes us genuinely feel for Frank Sheeran. I believe his first Oscar nomination for years is inbound. Pesci is also great in a somewhat reserved role, but it's Al Pacino that really shines in this film. He gives his typical loudmouth performance and should be considered the favourite for best supporting actor, in my book. The film has a good pace to it. The nearly three and a half hour runtime flies by... for the most part. Midway through the second act, things can get a little slow but by no means is it boring. Perhaps it's the kind of film you watch on Netflix rather see it in cinema. The character development overall is excellent. We get a good grasp of every character by the end of the film due to the run time. However, we don't hear a huge chunk of information regarding Frank's Irish background. It is merely mentioned with one or two references. I personally had no issue with the de-aging. I think it's done really well. At no point was I distracted or thought it looked unrealistic. The ending and/or final act as a whole is conclusive. You leave the cinema with a smile on your face. I see a best picture nomination incoming for The Irishman. You should check it out when it comes to Netflix November 27. 9/10"
"I love all the films of this genre-- Casino, Once Upon a Time in America, Goodfellas, Godfather, Mean Streets, Scarface, The Departed, Carlito's Way, Taxi Driver, etc. Scorsese makes some awesome epics, and I like a wide variety of other directors and their films in this vein. However, I find the hype and the hooplah around this one to fall a bit flat. I am sure I will receive some hate for this opinion, but this movie is nowhere near the level of Goodfellas or Scarface.1) The Run Time= I am fine with a 3.5 hour movie, but it needs to be great enough to fill that amount of time. I mean, at least 60-75% of it should be amazing. This movie is WAY TOO LONG for no reason. I can think of about 5 scenes that could be cut or condensed that did nothing to further the plot.2) The Aging and De-Aging of Actors= This was actually very distracting from the movie, and made me laugh in several scenes. Was this really NECESSARY? It seemed cheap and corny, and it really takes away from the movie instead of helping it. Wouldn't it be better to just get younger actors to play the really young scenes of DeNiro, Pesci, Pacino, etc??? No one is buying the age of these guys, even with CGI technology and effects. It ruined the belief of the moment.3) Pesci looked 139 years old throughout the movie, even in scenes where he is supposed to be young.4) Harvey Keitel's talent and presence was greatly wasted, as I barely remember anything that he did or said.5) The Women= the ladies are mentioned at the start of the film by name, and then become completely irrelevant to anything that goes on for 3 hours. They were extremely underdeveloped. This was one thing that complimented Goodfellas well- Ray Liotta's wife was always in the mix, or screwing something up, or threatening to kill him, etc.6) Lack of Suspense or Action= This movie became very run-of-the-mill boring after an hour or so. Nothing surprised me, nothing was exciting, and the action is so neutered and far between that I forgot I was watching a gangster flick. I can still remember Pesci stabbing a guy in the throat with a pen in Casino, or Scarface's last stand, or the beatings given out in Goodfellas. This movie barely had ANY MEMORABLE SCENES that stand out. The only great ones were a couple of really quick and realistic shootings of guys on the street or in an eatery by DeNiro.7) Pacino as Hoffa= He doesn't even resemble Hoffa at all, and neither do other people portraying certain characters. Robert Kennedy comes to mind as well.This is a decent movie, with great production values, classic actors, a legendary director, and nostalgic music with a great soundtrack. However, I just think a 8 or 9 rating is BS for this project. EVERYONE IS SIMPLY SAYING WHAT THEY ARE TOLD TO SAY, just like every other overhyped movie or author or artist. It is a good movie, but far from a masterpiece, or Scorsese's crowning achievement, despite what everyone says.Scarface, Goodfellas, Godfather, Departed= all light years beyond this movie, and with a shorter run time. This film needed to be tightened up and given some better scenes. It is interesting, but overbloated and overhyped due to the cast and director-- which can do no wrong in the minds of the average critic or average joe."
"All the bad reviews are 100% true and accurate. At 46, Of course I've always loved Scors., & ALL these actors. But this was just a horrid waste. Senseless, no need. But, mind-boggling as to why he didn't use any number of dozens of terrific actors in their 30s-40s to portray the guys in the early years. The ENTIRE film was so difficult to sit through. It certainly cheapens The Godfather's, Goodfellas, Casino, Raging Bull, etc. All these guys in their late 60's-early 80's, omg it's sad & pathetic. Sry, NOT sry. I just watched silly Jack&Jill- Pacino cracked me up. Dirty Grandpa w/ DeNiro & Zac Effron..stupid but hysterical. The film w/DeNiro & Anne Hathaway where he plays a retired intern was charming. HOWEVER, too bad they didn't realize they had no business doing another gangster flick!! SHAME. I'd DEF Recommend skipping. You're not missing anything. I promise."
"They just overdone it with the digital botox, especially on deniro in the first half of the film. I felt like I was watching some sort of jurrassic park. deniro and pacino only start to act and stop looking like some computer game avatars in the second half. pesci us just a shadow of himself.the script is rather bland, boring story watching grumpy old men. the characters dont open up to the audience, theres is always too much distance. boring dialogues without tension. women actually dont play any role.scorsese should have cut the first half and shorten the movie to 100 minutes, ir produce a mini series."
"Seen this afternoon at the NYFF.This film will doubtless go down as ""The Godfather"" of its generation, with Pacino and De Niro both on hand to assure continuity. Neither of them has done anything remotely as brilliant as this in decades, and the great revelation of the film, Joe Pesci, hasn't done anything at all. It has taken Scorsese's alchemy, back at its peak, to bring the three of them together in ways that surpass the sum of their considerable parts.Although (or because?) much of the film concerns the bleakness of old age, each of them, Scorsese included, is here restored to his astonishing peak capacity: the film's dirty little secret is that much of its substance concerns the process of human subsidence and movement toward the grave (some -- many -- more expeditiously than others, of course, with titles accompanying the first appearance of so many of the minor characters to tell us , laconically, in which appalling way this was accomplished), its principals seem to have discovered the fountain that restores, if not their youth, at least their youthful talents and energy, albeit with a world-weariness that we should all heed.Don't worry about the film's amazing length -- it goes by at warp speed, and if if not for slowing down of its own accord (and logic) in its final half hour, you may feel deprived by how swiftly it is dispatched.The professional reviews. out today, make much of the digital ""de-aging"" that allows the principals to be portrayed in early and late middle age, as well as closer to their natural ages. I confess that I don't see a problem with this, nor, I suspect, will most viewers. Under Maestro Scorsese's baton, all of them are fully convincing at each of these phases of life.Interestingly, it is De Niro (who played the young Vito Corleone) to whom the elegiac moments, poignantly and all-too-realistically portrayed, are given, whereas it is Pacino, to whom those unforgettable solo moments as the middle-aged Don were given, whose role here ends as it began -- in the total intoxication and lack of self-awareness of the powerful and unscrupulous. Pesci's self-awareness and watchful, controlling understanding of the realities of power, obviates the need for introspection -- he never wavers in his understanding of where the chess pieces stand on the board, and how they must, inevitably, be moved, and only fleetingly does he seem to perceive the cost of all that. Far more than his past scenery-chomping roles for Scorsese and others, Pesci's character here is, in this sense, the most terrifying figure in the film.The political messages are oblique (history unfolds largely in the background, on TV sets), but the core Scorsese message about the utter corruption of American life and the impossibility of combating this -- if only because the alleged watchdogs, up to and including Presidents, are , in turn, so easily corrupted -- comes through loud and clear. It's hardly an original message, but Scorsese (like Coppola before him) dissects these dynamics with exquisite precision. The message for our current politics couldn't be clearer, or scarier.Mention must be made of the flawless ensemble cast which backs up these principals, including the amazing women, who play such important, but background roles. (In mob films, as in Catfish Row in the great revival of ""Porgy and Bess"" now at the Metropolitan Opera, ""a woman is a sometime thing."" )I feel privileged to have been present at one of the first public screenings of a film that will certainly join the pantheon. But I must get back to see it again and again, such is the richness contained in almost every frame and sequence."
"You need stamina to sit through it all. My god is the second half of it slow. There are good parts but what age are all these guys supposed to be. The look like old men and walk like old men but in the flash backs, which is most of the film they look like old men with stoops and bad plastic surgery."
"So I'm to suspend disbelief that with CGI Deniro is supposed to be a 30 year old man, Pesci refers to him as ""kid"" in one scene. Huh? Though the CGI was good enough to make him look like he was maybe in his mid 50s in the face, his body movements were definitely that of a geriatric. And what, Pesci and Pacino were supposed to be in their 40s? Cause this was the age of the real life people these actors were portraying in the 1950s. Hogwash! They couldn't just get younger actors, could they?Look, I'm not a die hard Deniro or Pacino fan. I'm not even a gangster movie fan, I love Scarface and The Departed and that's pretty much it. Both of those movies had long run times, though not nearly as long as this one, but they were entertaining and easy to sit through. Not quite an hour into this film and I was checking the time. Maybe that affects my rating as well, since this isn't my genre, though the CGI takes this movie way down in notches regardless of the types of films you like.Not to say this is necessarily a 1 Star film, but I needed to curb all the 10 star ratings that go on about how this is the best movie ever. Not even close!"
Very disappointed. I was expecting a lot more with this cast. It was so slow moving it was almost impossible to stay awake. It could have and should have been told in half the time.
"I am a HUGE Scorsese fan but in my opinion this is his worst film to date. Right from the beginning De Niro is not believable as Frank Sheeran. His movements because of his age are so restricted that it's almost comical. There was some good acting in this movie and 2 performances stood out to me. Stephen Graham and Joe Pesci were very impressive, also the actor who portrayed 'Fat' Tony Selerno was very good as well. Overall I gave this a 5 out of 10. It probably deserved a 6 out of 10 but I was so disappointed because it was a Scorsese film I couldn't go above a 5."
"You choose a film based on the recognition of your favorite producer and actors, entering the theatre fantasizing the fantastic mobster story you are about to watch and trat your soul for at least a week with the top notch masterpiece once again created by the artistic mind of Scorsese. You are sitting on your seat getting amazed by the great make up and the location sets and great performance of Robert DeNiro for the the first 15 mins, nevertheless the excitement and admiration begins to fade as the story becomes dull and does not add much original twist to a classic mobster story. The personal life of the main characters such as the divorce or the daughters seem to be intended to bring a humane sensation to the story however it seems to have massively failed. Peggy does not bring much of a loving touch to the story I'm afraid.In summary the film was a let down by movie legends."
"This is simply not a good movie, for all the reasons clearly spelled out in the negative reviews here. The glowing reviews calling it a 'masterpiece' are beyond bizarre.A too long, boring story- told lazily. Bad writing. Terrible CGI.The scene outside the grocery store says it all. Deniro is supposed to be a tough guy in his prime and yet he looks like an old man trying to unsuccessfully kill a junebug on a shuffleboard court.Slapping young faces on stiff, arthritic senior citizens was a very poor decision.And even if it did work, it still wouldn't have saved this POS."
As the headline states. Super boring. Milking a dead cow. This movie ruins a great Scorcese legacy. Too long. No plot. Characters too old. CGI is really off-putting. Feels like you are watching Lord of the rings.
"The rave reviews for this film just prove how blinded people can be by someone's past achievements.Boring story, boring script, feels very low budget in every aspect, the violent scenes were frankly embarrassing.Judging by this latest offering I think Scorsese has long since had his day, he should have left it alone at Boardwalk Empire and enjoyed his retirement.Hate to say it to be honest, but I can't see why anyone would rave on about this film.Drivel."
"This reunion of the mob characters is just last time they can pick the dough. Movie is nothing extraordinary, Martin Scortese made same type of movie that he always made, it's a story told be the character about how he got involved with a mob, a like sad story of normal teen or man looking to make a extra buck. However these movies a glorifying behaviors that are barbaric in nature. And 3.5 hour time is overbearing, since you have to listen to monologue from either Al Pacino or Joe Pesci and character that DeNiro is staying on sidelines. He is suppose to be main character however he plays a guy who listens and then sometimes does things that lowlife bosses are impressed with. Hopefully this a last time I see these old farts together, unless a sequel gets made how the end up in hell, probably in one cell slicing garlic with razor and having those meaningless conversations."
"I can't believe how long and bad this movie is. The CGI is really miserable, and I'm just really tired of the same old story line. Give it up guys, the nursing home is calling!"
"What is everybody on about ? The CGI geriatrics acting tough is just cringy, the dialogue puts you to sleep, it's a pointless movie that should have never been made in the first place. Three and a half hours of boring nothingness. Waste of money."
"Found this long, drawn out and really rather dull. I did it in 3 instalments as was getting bored. I really don't get the hype!"
"It's the same old story, seen it before, not sure about what's the big deal here; the rise of an Italian-american mafia hit man told as a reminiscence by him. Sure the acting is excellent, how can it not be with a cast like this. Buts that's about it, zero novelty in the narrative, at times really slow and even irritating.
The end, by which I mean the last hour and a half, could easily be 30 minutes instead."
It was so boring my partner and I fell a sleep during the movie.
"This is a film,cthat should never have been made. Pesci should never have come out of retirement. Way too long with unnecessary fillers of phone calls, airplane flights and road trip.Despite the computer modified age change, it cannot change the old man dynamic with slow non-engaging dialogue.The lack of female dialogue in the film screams at you like Deniro's attempt to show emotional expressions. Pacino is the same Pacino, who apprently can only swear using the word cocksucker. And the dragging, oh my God, the dragging to get to the uninvetable end.I never thought it would come to a stage where I was close to falling asleep a couple of times during a Scorsese movie."
"For such a meticulous filmmaker Scorsese did not pay enough attention to these details. (Like the ridiculous scene where Joe Pesci pulls out spark plugs with his hands --no wrench--and says' they're ok. And the timing chain--utterly and truly ridiculous to think you could tighten a nut and it would continue running.) But I digress. The idea that a brand new Hudson (a car that had its heyday in the 1940s; out of business by 1954) would be running the streets all shiny and new in the late 50's --given that most of the other cars in the film are the ""forward look"" cars introduced by Chrysler in 1957 is silly.I truly despise the romance of the Mafia. But Scorsese has the deepest love for them and this is his attempt at monumentalizing them."
"This movie is a great cure for insomnia. I fell asleep after 45 minutes, but doubt if I missed anything worth watching."
"This was a boring film, everything was dull, dialogue,music,timing etc.
All these 10 reviews must be from people who worked on the film ,how you can stay awake for the whole film then rate it 10/10 is fake. What a waste of talent time and money, wear an adult diaper while watching because you will be bored ."
"The 10 star ratings and gushing reviews are a joke. They cannot be serious; they are not credible. The blind loyalty is hard to fathom.The script itself is boring. A snoozer. Time creeps by so slowly that you not only look at your watch, you shake it too to make sure its still working.JUST BECAUSE THIS TEAM MADE GOOD FILMS IN THE PAST DOESN'T AUTOMATICALLY MAKE THIS A GOOD FILM.Yeah, Pacino, Pesci, DeNiro, Scorsese -- a legendary combo. No one denies this. But this film is garbage: Scenes that don't advance the plot. Half-hearted acting. Drab dialogue. Thought experiment -- replace the main actors with unknowns. What would you give this title then? 10 stars? Best film of the decade? A masterpiece? Lol! This wouldn't make it out of 2 star range.And here's the thing: Aside from Pesci (who holds this film together with an amazing turn) the acting is average. That's a fact. And a fact that is noted in other reviews here grounded in reality.And the absolute worst thing about this film-- as noted in other reviews -- is that the de-aging simply does not work. IT. DOES. NOT. WORK. AT ALL! This leads to bizarre, jolting scenes that rip you out of the story and have you looking at people around you like ""WTF???"".The grocer scene comes to mind. A 100 year old DeNiro, de-aged to (something? Its hard to tell, he looks like a Sleestack from Land of the Lost) beating up on a grocer that outweighs him by a 100 pounds is comical and strange to behold. DeNiro hits about as hard as a 2 year old boy fighting for his favorite dinosaur. Scorsese would have done better to have young DeNiro TOTALLY rendered in CGI like the Hulk. Seriously.Get a grip in reality 10 star people."
"After persuading my wife to watch this movie that I couldn't wait to watch, it turned out that she enjoyed it whereas I couldn't wait for it to end and put me out of my misery.Such a shame that the film missed the essential ingredient of being interesting.Massive disappointment (for me anyway!)"
"Why do you get someone with a thick Italian accent to play an Irishman?So this movie is literally a whose who of Italian actors, with one off the all-time great Hollywood directors and producers, however it still manages to be underwhelming. Watching it felt like death by a thousand cuts and is a disgrace to The Godfather and Goodfellas."
I dont really get what everybody likes about this movie. More than three hours of old man talking about gangster thing's plus some murders. That's it.
Old men with painted hair pretending to be younger .. crap script .. it's not goodfellas... it's not casino ..Really really big disappointment
"This was just a sad chance on an inflated budget. I've seen better with less. The actors were decent, the story lacking. Netflix should be ashamed of this expression for a possibility of more without a screen..."
Had hard time watching this film. Was expecting something interesting. 3+ hours about nothing. Either there are paid reviews out there or people don't know what they are talking about. Mediocre movie at best.
