"A film about boxing, diamonds, gangsters pretending to be Jews, a fat getaway driver, a rather vicious dog and man eating pigs. Guy Richie has followed the success of Lock, Stock with an equally stunning and ambitious return just as Tarantino did with Pulp Fiction. The characters are so colourful they jump right off the screen, the dialogue so snappy you want to learn it by heart and the acting simply wonderful. Vinnie Jones reveals he can act and Brad Pitt shows that he is far more than a pretty face and could well win a best supporting actor oscar for his role as Irish Mickey. See this movie!!!!"
"""Snatch"" is fantastic; and not least because it demonstrates emphatically that the British movie industry is capable of rivaling even the best of what Hollywood can offer.""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" was one of the funniest movies released in recent years, and ""Snatch"" takes everything that ""Lock, Stock..."" did so well and does it even better.Back are the cleverly intertwined plotlines, the hilarious one-liners, and the simultaneously intimidating and comedic London villains. So is the skillful editing, and often original cinematographic style. This time however, it all looks somewhat slicker and better funded, and alongside the British regulars are the odd American celebrity (Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro).Everyone in the film puts in an excellent performance, but Pitt stands out as a charismatic and near-incomprehensible Gypsy boxer.Like Ritchie's earlier film, this one takes a little while to find its feet, but once it does the pace doesn't slacken until the finale. One scene featuring three guys and a squeaking dog in a stolen car stands out particularly, and left the audience at my local cinema almost weeping as punchline after punchline was uttered.When it comes to comedies, I cannot recommend this one highly enough. If you're after a good laugh, you won't find much to better ""Snatch""."
"I was never really too keen on ""Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels"".  All my friends constantly quoted it, raved and ranted, and then when ""Snatch"" came out, everyone made an even bigger deal of that.  I watched Lock Stock, and though I did like it, it didn't really tickle my fancy.  But Snatch, that's a completely different story all together.When I saw Snatch at the cinemas, I was shocked to see a couple leave only fifteen minutes into the film.  As they left, you could hear their intellectually deficient comments; ""this movie is so boring"".  I couldn't believe it!  I'd recommend this movie to ANYONE, The Pope even!There are hundreds of thousands of reasons for anyone to see this movie; each word of the script being a reason.Snatch is possibly one of THE best written movies I've seen. It's smart, witty, funny and has just the right touches of dark humour.  With characters like Turkish, Mickey, Tommy, Brick Top, Bullet Tooth Tony and Cousin Avi; their witty repartee will have your personal quotes list full for months after watching it.  The camera work and editing complement each other to keep the film's pace on its toes, much like the boxers at the center of the character's stories.Jason Statham has some of THE best lines in the movie, constantly slamming anything even slightly intelligent his partner Tommy has to say.  Brad Pitt turns out an excellent performance as the Irish-Gypsy-Pykie Mickey; his accent is hilarious.  Even though the story line is only a simple one (following a massive Diamond through England's criminal underworld), it is the connections each character has to the diamond and each other that really makes this film stand out from all the usual jewel-heist films.Another 10 / 10 from me on this one, it's just a pity the follow up to Snatch was a ""collaborative effort"" from Mr. Richie and his um.......wife."
"`Snatch', written and directed by Guy Ritchie is by far one of my favorite films of all time  it is easily in my personal Top Thirty.  In the film, about (what else?) several schemes that happen to go very wrong yet manage to intertwine and (for better or worse) resolve themselves in the end, Ritchie assembles one of the funniest cast of characters in recent memory. Let's see if we can keep this straight:Turkish (Jason Statham) and his partner Tommy (Stephen Graham) are amateur boxing promoters who, after their premier fighter is wounded, have to find a replacement to fight, or one of the meanest guys in London, Brick Top (Alan Ford), who just happens to run the boxing matches and stands to make a lot of money off of the fight is going to impart his unique brand of justice on them.  Enter Mickey (Brad Pitt) the gypsy who knocked their fighter out, who is an unintelligible drunk with quite a right hook.  Meanwhile, there is a diamond `the size of a fist' that has been stolen by Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro). On his way back from London to America where he is planning on fencing the diamond, trouble ensues, and his fence, Cousin Avi (Dennis Farina) is forced to come to London to find both Franky and the diamond with the help of characters like Bullet Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones) and Doug `The Head' Denovitz (Mike Reid).  Of course, this can't happen easily, as there are a trio of inept thieves on the trail of the diamond as well as my personal favorite character in the film, Boris `The Blade' Yurinov (Rade Serbedzija)  or as he's better known, `Boris the Bullet Dodger'.  Did you get all that?  The performances by all of the above actors, and several more that I didn't even mention are all really good, particularly Brad Pitt's.  Every single actor in `Snatch' looks like they are having one hell of a good time working in the film. This story, while complex and with many ramifications from the core plot is absolutely brilliant and a lot of fun.  There are many one-liners that I still personally use four years after first seeing the film, and the intricate weaving of the characters to tell a very simple heist story is just SO good.  `Snatch' would be a great film due to its story alone, but Guy Ritchie's direction is so dead on, the film transcends brilliant and becomes FAN-insert your choice of expletive here-TASTIC.  The slick cinematography, lightning-fast pacing and fun camera angles are right on target with the story.  Add on a great soundtrack that spans Oasis, techno and a traditional-sounding Hasidic song and Ritchie has presented the viewer with an instant classic.  While this was not the first time I had seen the film `Snatch', it was the first time I'd watched the film knowing that I would have to analyze it slightly in order to funnel my thoughts from the film just being `Phenomenal!' to `Phenomenal because..'  While I can certainly be classified as an unabashed Madonna fan, and have been for the last two decades, I REALLY hope that Ritchie decides to drop his wife from his film work and not continue on the `Swept Away' path, rather, to get back to the work that has earned him well-deserved high praise.  Sorry Madge.--Shelly"
"Guy Richie's follow up to Lock Stock and Two Smoking barrels is every bit as astonishing as its predecessor. The humour is better and I have never seen people in a cinema laugh as loud and as frequently as they did here. Vinnie Jones plays a similar role as Big Chris, here as Bullet Tooth Tony. His appearance is limited but boy does he make an impact. Even when he is not on screen there is much to savour from Dennis Farina as Avi and a trio of pawnbrokers who are sent to rob a bookies. Brad Pitt sheds his movie start personna and preforms impressively as an Irish gypsie. Unlike Lock Stock.. the humour will appeal to all nationalities. However they mind some slang expressions such as Pikey and blag hard to understand. Good preformances, fantastic characters, razor sharp diologue, expert direction and camera work and brilliant humour, Snatch will make you laugh more than any other movie this year. See it now."
"Read this review carefully, please.First off, Snatch is an amazing movie in every sense of the word. There are very few movies made where the director obviously did not let one FRAME onto the screen without a reason, and Snatch is one of them. Nothing happens onscreen without it having an effect on the plot.By now you know the plot, or plots. We follow a diamond-heist and the various characters trying to get theirs, at the same time following participants in an illegal boxing ring. The incredible part of the movie is how every scene ties in with the rest somehow, every character connects with the rest at least once.There are complaints that the movie is confusing, or muddled. There are a lot of things that they don't tell you (such as what the dog has to do with anything, but he's a VERY important character), and that's a good thing. Too many movies force feed the audience its plot points (Think The Ring vs. Ringu, did we need the ""How long could you survive down there all alone?"" line?). Rather, we just watch occurrences, and have to piece together what ties everything together, the plot weaves together beautifully.The cinematography and performances are fantastic as well. Even the soundtrack is perfect. The camera style during the fight scenes (slowdown/stop/go) makes it difficult to stop watching, the sound effects fit in quietly in the background without being overwhelming. And it will be IMPOSSIBLE to watch this movie without repeating many of the lines around your friends. I found myself saying ""Zee Germans"" and things like ""It's not like he's a set of car keys, now is it?"" quite a bit. Naturally, Brad Pitt's pikey is one of the most outlandish I've ever seen.Summary: watch the movie, and don't expect to be TOLD everything, expect to have to pay attention."
"This movie is perfect in all its categories: credits, sound track, production, casting, writing, photography, editing, acting, and direction. 10/10.I was amazed with the freedom of the use of the camera. This movie will change the way movies are made. Slow-mo, stills, black and white, and color were all used to brilliant effect.I must pick out specific actors who were just over the top - meaning 10+!Jason Statham as ""Turkish"" is simply superb - a star of very high caliber. (You should see him in anything he made, and read my comment about John Carpenter's movie: ""Ghosts of Mars."")Alan Ford as ""Brick Top"" is terrifying - his forced speaking style made me think that he was chewing on the flesh of his previous victim.Vinnie Jones as ""Bullet Tooth Tony"" is total tough head to foot tough - a walking brick wall - a marine for all seasons - none tougher.Brad Pitt as ""Mickey O'Neil"" is utterly 110% convincing. I never liked Mr. Pitt's work before this - but this one totally sold me - he is as solid an actor as ever came out of Hollywood... and better!Finally, Guy Ritchie should be recognized as a Michelangelo of film.-LD"
"The release of Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" in 1994 prompted a schism in the staid gangster movie genre: the standard hallmarks - serious characters, gunfights, intrigue and damsels in distress - were enhanced with snappy dialogue, and gallows humour.  The biggest change however was the introduction of the mobius strip-style plot line, where the concept of time is no longer linear, instead constantly folding in upon itself, flitting between past, present and future that forces the viewer to pay close attention lest they miss some subtle detail.  Inevitably, numerous copycat films emerged that tried to capitalize on Tarantino's success, but it wasn't until 1998 when Guy Ritchie, an unknown British director, took on the challenge that a successor was found.  Now Ritchie is determined to prove that his first time out wasn't a fluke.Turkish is a young man with an entrepreneurial bent, who, when he's not running his gambling operation, manages bareknuckle boxers.  Through a business deal gone wrong, he becomes acquainted with one Mickey O'Neil, a mumbling manic motor-mouthed piker who also happens to be a one-punch marvel.  Turkish persuades Mickey to join his stable of fighters, but soon discovers that Mickey has his own agenda, and gets Turkish in trouble with the gangsters who run the underground boxing circuit.  Other characters that become involved in the drama include a four-fingered degenerate gambler/jewel thief, a vicious boxing promoter, a gang of inept robbers, a polite hitman, a crazed Russian gun runner, a group of Irish gypsies, a crooked New York jeweler and a pugnacious pet.  The common thread binding them all is a perfect diamond the size of a peach pit.  If you aren't confused yet, you soon will be.""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", Mr. Madonna's (Ritchie) first film, was shot on a small budget, with a no-name cast (except for football bad boy Vinnie Jones) and quickly became a rousing success at home and found receptive audiences abroad.  While not a technically a sequel ""Snatch"" is stylistically very similar to ""Lock, Stock"":  Ritchie utilizes his trademark bombastic staccato sequences, and repeatedly bounces off on radical tangents to throw the viewer off balance.  He did however opt for a decidedly darker satirical tone in this film, that may make some people uncomfortable (think ""Very Bad Things"").  What struck me as particularly daring was his decision to create a story with such a voluminous cast.
Ritchie faced a daunting task with this film: how, with roughly twenty principal characters, does one adequately flesh out each character, and not hopelessly confuse the audience?  The feat was made doubly difficult, as several cast members are big name stars.  Somehow Ritchie manages - each actor is full bodied, receives ample screen time, and no one character is the centerpiece.  With so many talented actors, it is difficult to pick out one performance that stands out:  Rade Serbedzija is hilarious as the mad Russian who blithely burns through each of his nine lives, as is Vinnie Jones' manic gentleman hitman.  On the other end of the spectrum, is Alan Ford as Brick Top, the promoter with a penchant for pigs, who epitomizes cold-blooded viciousness. If forced to pick my favorite however, I would have to go with Brad PittPitt resurrects his trailer trash look from ""Kalifornia"" and adopts a nearly indecipherable brogue that sounds like my best friend's Uncle Wally on a bad day.  As Mickey O'Neil, the hard drinking wily grifter and part-time pugilist, Pitt displays a wide range of emotions, demonstrating again that he is not only a star, but also a gifted character actor.  And I would be remiss if I didn't mention the dog that subtly stole every scene he appeared in.While ""Snatch"" initially struggles to find its stride, and is very similar to Ritchie's earlier film, it is fresh and funny enough to make you forget any minor shortfalls and stand on its own."
"Imagine what would happen if you took 8 or 10 criminals of various professions, threw them into a maze, gave one of the criminals a diamond the size of a fist, and yelled out load, ""SOMEONE IN THIS MAZE HAS A HUGE DIAMOND!  WHOEVER FINDS IT AND IS THE LAST MAN STANDING, WINS!"" What do you think would happen?  Snatch is what happens.Snatch is a confusing, twisting, crazy movie.  Let me repeat that.  This movie is crazy!  Imagine the Mr. Toad's Wild Ride at Disney Word on acid, and this is what you get my friend.  Believe it or not, this mass confusion and complete insanity is very, very entertaining.The movie has it's problems.  First off, for those of you who have seen Snatch's predecessor, (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels), you know that Guy Richie (the writer and director of both films) has a very music-video style as far as the camera angles, movements, and cinematography goes.  The strange camera techniques get so mad with lunacy that I noticed people walking out of the theater.  I was also turned off by this madness. However, most of this insane crap gets over within the first hour, so it doesn't last.If any of you people out there loved Lock Stock as much as I did, do yourself a favor and see this movie as fast as you can.  Snatch is a bit more serious than Lock Stock, but when it's funny, you'll laugh till your lungs burst.  It was nice to see Vinnie Jones, who was Big Chris in the last movie, return as the same basic character (only now named Bullet Tooth Tony) and doing the same ""slamming victim's head in a car door"" act again.  The performances were just as great as Lock Stock, with Jason Statham and Pitt leading the pack.  I was disappointed to see that Bendicio Del Toro didn't have a bigger role.  I was expecting him to be a lead character, but he's not.So, in conclusion, if you have never seen Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, I would see that first before seeing Snatch so you can get adjusted to Guy Richie's style.  I still think that it is stupid to compare either two movies to Pulp Fiction (unlike most people), but it is in the same ballpark as Pulp.  That means if you liked Pulp, you will most likely like Snatch and Lock, Stock.  If you have never seen Pulp or Lock Stock, you have deprived your life of culture.9/10"
"I saw the first showing of Snatch in my town this past Friday.  I loved it. I am quite a fan of Guy Ritchie's first and was expecting more of the same with Snatch.  Rarely do a film's opening credits hype an audience as much as Snatch.  Quick paced action-to-freeze-frame-cuts introduce each cast member in situations that identify their character sort.  Then we're right in it. It's true, similarities abound between Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.  From Vinnie Jones' character's tough as nails negotiating means, to oft referred to in-jokes between characters ('Zee Germans' here compared to 'Tubby Tommy' in LS&2SB).  Still the film is fresh and not really a Lock, Stock take 2 of any sort. The humor is more frequent in this one and a major difference is how dark this film is compared to the previous.  Alan Ford's Brick Top is the meanest SOB I can remember on film since Mr. Blonde in Reservoir Dogs.  Brad Pitt is a standout too as the never to be trusted One Punch Mickey-he's not as incomprehensible as the trailers make him out to be, but still that pikey accent is a huge laugh.  And the scene where he is glaring at a burning trailer lumped my throat (when you find the context by which that scene is drawn it should get a reaction from anyone). The use of violence as humor is more embellished in Snatch as well (eg: the Bullet Tooth Tony and Boris the Blade showdown). Secondary characters are all over the movie and all grab laughs from their scenes , especially the dog and the tank of a getaway driver, Tyrone.See this movie for it's frenetic energy, retribution for the ""good guys"" is all that ties the end together but the ride to the finale is what makes this movie great.  After all, as a wiser man than myself once said, it's not where you go, it's how you get there.  Snatch is all about the ride."
"I would imagine viewers would either really love this movie or be totally turned off. It is presented in a different format for its time (since copied), has very odd and profane characters, accents that are difficult to understand, and tells an unpleasant story with some disgusting scenes. So, why do I enjoy this film, being an old-fashioned so-and-so?Well, because I usually enjoy ""stylish"" film-making and dark humor and this has both in abundance. This is almost as stylish as it gets: fascinating visuals, odd camera angles and various tricks, sound effects, etc. Most of the characters in this bizarre crime film have colorful nicknames and most speak in a strong British accent. A gypsy, played by American Brad Pitt, is almost intelligible.This is why I strongly recommend you use English subtitles while watching this film, at least for the first viewing, or you will totally lost. The DVD offers a feature I've never seen before: the option of using subtitles solely for Pitt's character. The filmmakers knew few people were going to understand Pitt's weird way of speaking. Anyway, I recommend the subtitles for everyone. It makes the film more enjoyable when you know what's going on, especially with the many slang terms used in here that have to be totally foreign to most viewers outside GB.Since the action changes every two minutes to another scene with other people (Lord of The Rings subsequently did the same), it's had to get lulled to sleep or have your mind wander. Something wacky is going on every few minutes. The attitudes of the criminals are rough: these are low-life people in the underworld: extremely tough people with the toughest being ""Bricktop"" (Alan Ford) who likes to feed people to the pigs. There are a ton of f-words in here, too.The disjointed story is not easy to follow and I found I needed several viewings to understand everything that was going on. The characters are so strange, so cartoon-like, that - combined with the unique visuals - it makes it a fascinating film to watch every time. Some of these actors were fairly unknown at the time of this release , at least here in the States, such as Jason Statham (""The Transporter"") but we know them know. There is a good mix of young and old actors in here.This is a guy's movie with the top dozen actors in this film all tough-talking, almost-crude men (plus a funny dog). It's so weird, I'll just end with the cliché that ""this is not for all tastes"" but if you enjoy dark humor and something totally different, you might want to give it a shot. Just remember to turn on the subtitles."
"I am a 33 year old woman in a flowered dress who doesn't drink, rarely swears, sleeps with a teddy bear, and has never raised a hand to anyone in my life.  But I liked this movie a lot, and according to someone who wrote a review earlier, that makes me personally responsible for the violence in America.  I'm sorry - I never intended to hurt anyone.As for the movie - I usually get confused in fast-paced movies with so many characters, but when I watched Snatch I was able to keep all the characters straight pretty easily because each one had something unique and quirky about him.  I liked that, and I liked the accents, and I liked the silly plot-twist humor, and I liked the dogs.  The evil men were EVIL (""so evil you would call it the froo-its of the dev-eel"" to quote Mike Meyers).  The bumbling men were endearing.  The music was great.  It was very violent (more so than Pulp Fiction, I think).  Yet somehow it did not offend me and looking back at it I still laugh out loud.Oh, and I never saw ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"", for whatever that's worth."
"Last year I was working on the IMDb Top 250 list, and I noticed that Snatch was on the list, so I decided to take a look at it. I was in Denmark at that time. I live in Faroe Islands.I stayed at my uncle's apartment, and he told me that you have to watch some of Guy Ritchie's movies before watching Snatch to get to know his movies better, so I watched Revolver. I was not very keen on it and then I was not looking forward to see Snatch.While my uncle was not at home, I decided to watch it. I wanted to turn it off after the first second, because I thought it was so weird. I'm 14 years old now, and I knew almost nothing about cinema back then, and I had never seen such a movie like Snatch, and it's style! I thought it would be stupid of me to turn it off after 1 second so I kinda forced myself to watch it. To be honest, I actually loved the weird style after 10 minutes!The cinematography was great. I had never seen something like that before and the editing was just as great too. There were lots of great characters and the script was excellent. It was funny and clever and it will you make you laugh every single second! This movie is like Pulp Fiction. You can almost quote every line! The acting was totally awesome! Jason Statham, Vinnie Jones and the rest were great, but Brad Pitt totally stole the show!I was thinking to myself ""This movie can't be any better!"", but then it got better! Brad Pitt showed up! His accent got me laughing all the time! My stomach hurt, it literally hurt, and I got many bruises on my thighs because I could not stop hitting myself from laughing!This was one of the few movies that I didn't want to end, so I decided to watch it again the next day and the next day after that.I have seen a lot of movies in my life, but there are few movies that are better than this one! It's definitely in my top 15 of all time.It truly deserves a 10/10"
"A Diamond heist by Franky Four Fingers is carried out and he flies into London on a stop over.  He goes to Boris The Blade for a gun and Boris tells him to go to the bookies for him and put money on a fight in exchange. Boris then sets Frankie up and has a group of men waiting to rob the bookies and Frankie.  The fight in question is also difficult because promoters Turkish and Tommy have promised local villain Brick Top that they'll put up a fighter.  Said fighter is put in hospital by a gypsy Tommy buys a caravan from (Mickey).  Putting Mickey in the fight makes things worse when he not only refuses to take a dive but knocks the fighter out  to Bricktop's displeasure!  Meanwhile Frankie's boss flies into London to find him and the jewel while Bricktop tries to catch the men who Boris sent to knock over his bookies.I had seen Lock, Stock and enjoyed it to a certain degree.  It had problems but it was fresh and had energy and style.  It re-launched the British gangster film with some good ones and some bad copies.  One of those copies was Snatch  admittedly a copy by the same director!  This film has all the style and energy of the Lock, Stock and borrows heavily from it.  However it is clear that the plot is both weak and over-plotted (if that's possible!). It is weak because it is so full of cliché and silly occurrences and it is over-plotted in that every scene needs more plot in order to explain the new thing that just happened!What keeps it watchable is Ritchie's style and energy.  The plot may not work but it moves along with pace that almost (almost) covers it's lack of substance.  So we get the same old cockney gangsterisms, dark humour, Vinnie Jones being tough with a few good lines and so on.  It felt to me like Ritchie just didn't have any other ideas in him.  It's all very samey but his style saves it as he intercuts and delivers some really inventive shots. In tune with this style and energy is the casting.  The film is much better cast that it deserves!Statham and Graham are the least colourful characters in the piece and Ritchie knows it  so despite being the leads, they often play second fiddle and only act as the catalyst.  Ford, Reid, Jones et al all enjoy delivering tough old stereotypes and do well enough considering what they're there to do.  Pitt is a great bit of casting  and here he is DELIBERATELY doing a bad Irish accent (unlike Devil's Own where it was an accident!).  He is funny and seems to enjoy playing out of type.  Likewise Del Toro and Farina can only help add class to the film.Overall though this is a victory for style over substance.  It's visual style and general energy will carry it for the running time but when it was over I found it had failed to make any lasting impact on it and I really could remember very little of it  it had just seemed noisy and in a rush to get somewhere.  Sure, I enjoyed it while it was on, but as little as 10 minutes afterwards I realised that I'd been taken for a ride by the style and flair of Ritchie.  At time of writing it is 199 in the top 250  you gotta be kidding me!"
"I saw Sherlock Holmes a couple of months ago and it was very good. I couldn't believe how much I enjoyed that and my friends were raving about Guy Ritchie's style of film-making. So, now I wanted to see Ritchie's previous works & rented out Snatch as it was 135 in the top 250 of IMDb. I have to say I was very impressed. I didn't want to know anything about this film beforehand as it takes away something from the experience and told my friends to shut up about the plot of Snatch. This was Jason Statham's second film, he was not so well known and Brad Pitt was already a superstar. This is one of the best films out there and I totally agree with IMDb users.So, this is the plot. Unscrupulous boxing promoters, violent bookmakers, a Russian gangster, incompetent amateur robbers, and supposedly Jewish jewelers fight to track down a priceless stolen diamond.Turkish (Jason Statham) and Mickey O'Neil (Brad Pitt) are obviously the first reason anyone would want to watch to the film. I cannot believe how awesome both Statham & Pitt were in this movie. Tommy is like Turkish's brother, they have known each other for a long time. Turkish is a boxing promoter. He entangles himself in Brick Top's hands, who is a bookmaker and Brick Top is a man you wouldn't want to end up owing him. Franky Four Fingers has a large diamond, 86 carats, which he stole and he is in league with cousin Avi. Boris The Blade wants the diamond. Everyone's a gangster or a goon, so this is a film which has nobody but thugs. Doug The Head is a dealer & if anyone knows about the diamond, he is the man. He has two twin daughters working as his assistants in his shop. Anyway, Tommy wants a caravan for himself and Turkish and goes to the pikeys to buy one. But, there he is scammed and Gorgeous George (Turkish's boxer in the unlicensed match in which Brick Top has invested a large amount of money) and Mickey fight it out in a bare knuckle match and Mickey wins, so George is out for a few months. Now, Turkish hires Mickey as the boxer for the match. The deal was that Mickey had to go down in the fourth round, but he wins in one shot, which doesn't go down too well with Brick Top. Sol and his bumbling amateur robbers get involved with the diamond, the damn dog is in all the scenes they are in which is very funny. Bullet Tooth Tony also wants the diamond. You know what? Trying to explain the plot line is ridiculous. All you need to know is, the story is set in London and most of the English spoken is in British accent.Mickey's mom is burned down along with the caravan by Brick Top because Mickey tried to get a new caravan for his mother from Turkish and had said he wouldn't fight till he got it. That was very touching, the expression on Brad Pitt's face made me so sad for his mother, I felt is anguish & anger. That was a defining moment in the film. Then the big finale match at the end of the film was just awesome. Tommy, Turkish, Mickey's life and the lives of the whole family and friends of Mickey are on the line on this match. Being the bastard Mickey is, he could not possibly go down in the fourth round at least this time, can he? Brad Pitt, Jason Statham & everybody give an engrossing performance. The film is pure brilliancy on the part of Guy Ritchie, the man has style ingrained on his bones, every scene is visually stylistic and the dialogues are superb, the background score is also really catchy. The way he has interwoven the lives of all these characters is brilliant. How else can you empathize with these characters who are all basically villains going against each other? One thing is for sure, you cannot predict one scene in the film, no matter how many movies you have watched. Go snatch a copy of 'Snatch' (I am lame, I know.) 10/10"
"Exciting, interesting, never dull...the ideal movie when you're sick of boring movies that have a ton of down-time!Complicated plot twists keep you on your toes.  Great actors obviously having a blast keep you wanting to know what they'll do next.  A very tight screenplay can have you laughing and a director in his element combine for a very fun movie. Have to see it again..I didn't see 'Lock, Stock,...' so cannot say Guy Ritchie made the same movie twice, which some reviewers have alluded to. But if that is half as good as this, its got to be worth a look.Brad Pitt joins a distinguished group that includes Dustin Hoffman in 'Dick Tracy', and Robert Carlyle in 'Trainspotting', as Movie Characters Who You Don't Understand Half of What They Are Saying...but that didn't matter one bit, it added to the overall enjoyment."
"(r#93)Whine, whine, whine, is that all you people know how to do? I mean, sorry to burst your bubble, but Snatch is not the kind of film you give an in-depth analysis. Snatch is a roller-coaster ride that you just sit back and enjoy. It is a brilliantly funny movie, with an unimportant story which still takes a couple of viewings to fully absorb. Add to that a fantastic cast, including Benicio Del Toro, Vinnie Jones, Jason Statham, Brad Pitt, the dog, and Alan Ford as the sweet-natured Brick Top. Add to *that* that Guy Ritchie's fantastic way of using his camera and music to give the fantastic flair that is the trademark of his ""lorry-gangsta"" films. What more could you want?Everyone's raving about Brad Pitt's performance as the incomprehensible Mickey, and yes, he's great. But Rabe Serbedzija doesn't get nearly enough attention as Boris the Blade! This guy is pure comic genius. Watch the scene where he's selling a gun to Turkish's partner Tommy. A fantastic actor all around. But what am I talking about? Literally every single actor is hilarious in this film. Benicio Del Toro is a complete psycho, Jason Statham keeps burning his buddy Tommy, Alan Ford is brutal (in more than one way) as the crime boss who feeds people to the pigs. The rather unknown Robbie Gee, Lennie James and Ade all hit the right notes as three slightly-less-than-competent street thugs.Do I even need to say that the script is utterly brilliant? Who can forget these lines?? ""I shoot you! You go down!""; ""It was two minutes five minutes ago!""; ""What? You don't think I've got the vitamins?""; ""Do you know what 'nemesis' means?""; ""It was *behind* you, Tyrone. When you reverse, things tend to come up from behind you!""; ""Tommy, 'the tit', is praying. And if he isn't, he f-ing should be.""; ""Don't snatch!""; ""I love this song!""; ""Anything to declare?"" ""Yeah. Don't go to England.""; the list goes on and on.Overall a hilarious, forgettable, but instantly quotable flick to just turn on and enjoy the hell out of whenever you're bored. And what's wrong with that? Do you really want every film to change your life? Snatch is entertainment at its finest, and if you have to whine about 1-dimensional characters, bad storyline, or style over substance, start a blog. At least then we won't have to read it.PS. IMDb doesn't know what a blog is."
"The tightly knit formula for the average ""heist movie"", is constantly in danger of becoming predictable to the point of redundancy with each new increasingly formulaic entry, so to see a film quietly whisk in and reinvigorate the genre was a refreshing feat indeed. And if anyone was up for the task, it was visionary director Guy Ritchie, sweeping into theaters fresh off his cult classic Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels to deliver his most hard hitting, savagely funny and effortlessly stylish film to date - Snatch. Director Ritchie has somewhat fallen out of favour with both critics and audiences of late with both his ill-advised cinematic tribute to his wife Madonna, Swept Away, and his nonsensical gambling drama Revolver, so it is easy to forget how masterful a filmmaker he can truly be when given the chance. Ritchie's convoluted tale, which ties together three parallel stories involving a diamond theft and the world of unlicensed bare knuckle boxing in the British underground may prove to be too full of twists and turns to be followed entirely on the first viewing. This, along with the stylistic similarities to its predecessor may prove to be the film's only major criticism; however, it is highly unlikely the majority of audiences will feel alienated by the fact that the adrenaline fuelled plot may prove hard to follow, and instead relish the chance to revisit the film multiple times to pick up on things they may have missed in previous viewings. In a film with as much to appreciate as this, it comes as no surprise that multiple viewings never seem to detract from the experience, but that the film seems only to increase in quality upon each viewing. Stylistically, the film is in a class of its own, employing hyper-kinetic cinematography and editing, which proves to be some of the most vivid and inventive work demonstrated in recent cinematic history. The film's score and musical selection is consistently pitch perfect, and endlessly catchy, never failing to amplify the seedy yet comical mood. Ritchie's sense of pacing is impeccable, and how a film which opens with a group of Jewish rabbis entering a bank, (which in itself sounds like the beginning to a particularly brilliant joke) only to steal its valuable contents, launching the film into an adrenaline fuelled title sequence could ever be considered not funny or at the very least oozing with style is beyond conventional logic. Ritchie also proves to have a real eye for location, and in each scene the viewer feels fully immersed in the grunge and filth of the underground, making the film that much more effective. The ensemble cast rise to the challenge of bringing Ritchie's brilliant screenplay to life, and turn out universally superb performances, each creating a unique and memorable character, complete with catchy names. Jason Statham is consistently strong as boxing promoter Turkish; his deadpan delivery and excellent narration carry the film wonderfully. Steven Graham similarly raises many a laugh as his consistently dumbfounded sidekick, Tommy. Benicio Del Toro makes wonderful use of his far too brief screen time as gambling addicted diamond thief Franky Four Fingers - his Las Vegas gambling flashbacks are nothing less than flat out hilarious. Ritchie favourite Vinnie Jones is savagely hilarious as mercenary Bullet Tooth Tony (a role it would seem is only a step away from his real life persona) and Russian actor Rade Serbedzija creates a simply classic character as arms dealer 'Boris the Blade'. Character actor Alan Ford makes for an exquisitely menacing antagonist as gambling shark 'Brick Top', and Robbie Gee and Lennie James are consistently hilarious as thoroughly unlucky attempted jewellery thieves. But surprisingly enough, the film's unlikely standout proves without a question to be its biggest star: Brad Pitt, waltzing in to steal the show as incomprehensible 'Pikey' boxer Mickey - an egoless and thoroughly hilarious performance. Though this may be familiar ground for those who have seen Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Guy Ritchie's Snatch is no less enjoyable as a result - brutally violent, caustic and hilarious, with Ritchie's trademark sense of incomparable style. Snatch excels in every possible aspect, and the truly talented cast bring their vibrant characters to life with unquestionable flair, each one flat out hilarious when given their moment to shine. Though all of the film's intricacies may not be entirely clear on the first viewing, this only makes each following viewing all the more intriguing and entertaining. For those who have yet to appreciate the cinematic genius that is Snatch... don't wait for protection from ""Zee Germans"", simply see it!-10/10"
"Upper middle-class mockney Guy Ritchie virtually remakes his previous hit LOCK,STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS,but this time with a larger budget,the addition of a Hollywood big-name (Brad Pitt),and even more flamboyant surface style than before.But this does not disguise the excessively complicated plot,the rather glib characterisations (not enhanced by jokey,Runyonese monikers),and the undoubted emptiness that lies beneath Ritchie's directorial excesses which threatened to get out of hand on LOCK STOCK;it certainly goes several miles overboard in SNATCH,which is to the film's considerable detriment.It is quite obvious that Ritchie is impersonating such American filmmakers as Scorcese and Tarantino (who himself has always been somewhat derivative of other directors,and judging by his recent efforts seems to be running out of the ideas he once had),though the gangster epics made by the aforementioned had far more style,depth,wit and conviction about them.Ritchie's closeted,wealthy background means that his essay in low-life criminality comes across as a caricatured,stylised fantasy,which admittedly is slick and very fast-paced,but lacking in the slightest bit of profundity.He may think his various directorial flourishes which he frequently employs here (and to a somewhat lesser extent in LOCK STOCK) are clever and the epitome of innovation,but they are actually anything but;merely designed to cover the obviousness of the plot,they rapidly become wearisomely flashy,and so resistibly self regarding as to become monstrous and indeed wholly pointless and unnecessary;subtler and quieter directorial techniques would've been much more credible and effective.The cast involved (Alan Ford,Jason Statham,Lennie James,Dennis Farina among them) appearing as various English,American and Russian mobsters are mostly adequate but are merely reduced to a back-seat ensemble due to Ritchie's directorial self-gratification.As with LOCK STOCK,Vinnie Jones plays Vinnie Jones again,though with even less persuasion this time,the soundtrack includes a tune from Ritchie's future spouse Madonna (it's doubtful much money had to paid for the copyright there),and Pitt is rather foolish as a virtually unintelligible Irish Traveller who gets dragged in to this most complex of stories.The only female role of any note comes from Sorcha Cusack as Pitt's mother,and that consists of a mere sprinkling of exposition. SNATCH has it's merits but like it's somewhat better predecessor LOCK STOCK,mostly gives the undeniable impression that it is overwhelmingly pleased with it's own bravado,which when you look more closely is not as outstanding as it believes it is.And Ritchie's subsequent flops (SWEPT AWAY,REVOLVER) means he will have to tone down his narcissism very soon or his career may never recover.RATING:5 and a half out of 10."
"I completely agree with Zafoid. This movie is the best ever made. I love all the actors/characters to death. But no one seems to notice Tommy. He's my favorite. He acts so well in the crying part and everywhere else. Just take moment to spot the genius. Brad Pitt became my favorite actor thanks to this movie too. I can go on and on for days explaining how i love every detail of the movie, especially the soundtrack.Every song. Even the trailer has amazing music. I repeat. The best movie ever made. Second best is Lock,Stock & Two Smoking Barrels, Ocean's 11, Ocean's 12. You have got to see those movies. But they will never win Snatch."
"""Snatch"" is a lot like ""Lock Stock"" in many ways. The formulas are exactly the same, and we have quirky characters, and scene-stealing Vinnie Jones always ready to slam a guys head in a car door. And of course a lot of underdogs getting to the top by some freak accident. It's differences are the presence of American actors (Benicio Del Toro, Brad Pitt, Dennis Farina) and in some ways it is more American. It's a lot more violent than ""Lock Stock"" and has more of a darkness to it. I'm teeter tottering whether I like the more violence and darkness in this Guy Ritchie project. I don't know whether I'm a big fan of the violence in this one, or maybe I just don't like hand to hand combat. The darkness is attributed with characters who have more depth than the characters in ""Lock Stock"". Though Brad Pitt's character is very funny, there is a moment, when his caravan is burning down, of a sad intensity in his eyes, there was nothing like this in ""Lock Stock"". I think Guy Ritchie's character development shows that he has grown more from his first project. Though he is following the same formulas as his previous work, there is more elements added to ""Snatch"". I highly suggest if you haven't seen ""Snatch"" or ""Lock Stock"", I suggest seeing ""Lock stock"" first. Because they are highly comparable (as if you couldn't tell) and ""Lock stock"" will help you bone up on the way Guy Ritchie writes and directs. I also suggest if you're new to Guy Ritchie to get a pad and paper and play connect the dots between all the characters. It's kind of hard doing it in your head like I did when I watched ""Snatch."""
"In this fast-paced thriller-comedy Ritchie again takes us into the 'underworld' of England and this time he does it with more assured direction than in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. This is a world full of tough, gritty and eccentric characters who cheat each other on everything from rigged unlicensed boxing games to multi-million pound diamond heists. This heist is central to the wide montage of characters in Snatch who all want a piece of the action.Snatch has one of the greatest opening credits in film history. It follows then, that the rest of the film should be equally entertaining and stylish, and it just about makes it. It is a viciously styled thrill of crime, humour and attitude almost solely propelled by the dialogue and interactions of its characters. There are no sugarcoating action effects or stunning visuals to detract - the core is the focus, and the core is its many dynamic characters, like Bricktop, Turkish and Tony and the hilarious situations they get themselves into. The stupidity and amateurism of these 'gangsters' provide for the comedic effect, as is Richie's style.The only slight flaw, as I can see it, is the lack of cinematic harmony. In other words, there is no traceable thread throughout the film - more likes a series of entertaining scenes. You know how some people are just born to write, and others have to practice to get to the same level or articulation and vocabulary - but ultimately, the idea of 'what sounds good' cannot be taught and the natural writer will be the better one. It is probably the same in direction, and Guy Ritchie is not a natural talent as there is no harmony. It's pretty good yes, but not harmonic.When I say more 'assured' direction on Richie's part, I mean that in Snatch, every scene and character serves a purpose - unlike in Lock, Stock where longer segments were often used. But above all, you can tell that the director had fun with the script because it translates so well in the film. It is more hilarious than anything, and the accents provide for half the comedy. A wildly entertaining and highly stylish crime film. 8/10"
"This move has everything. Guy Richie really nailed it, lock stock is a insanely entertaining but this one is even better and funnier. Every single scene is great and i just couldn't stop laughing. This movie is one of my all time favorites kicks as movies. I wish there where more movies like this but it's self explanatory it's unique. I recommend everyone to see this movie, you will not be disappointed. It's funny its clever it's ironic its everything... Great directing by Guy Richie, the movie is highly creative and enormously entertaining i simply loved it. If you liked lock stock and two smoking barells, you will definitely love this one. Snatch 9.0/10"
"This is top-class entertainment. The movie is brilliantly constructed and has its own unique style. Both the story and characters are over-the-top and therefor also extremely fun.This is a movie were basically is very little wrong with. It's some perfect mindless entertainment but with a complicated storyline. So it's still a sort of movie with a story, which you have to pay a lot of attention to, while watching. The movie is made in the same style as the previous Guy Ritchie movie, ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"". There are lots of similarities between these two movies, so if you liked ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" you'll most likely also really like this movie as well.Main difference with ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" though, is that this movie has a 'bigger' cast with some more well known names in it. Jason Statham who made his debut in ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" plays the main character in this movie. Brad Pitt plays a very fun role and fits surprisingly well into the typical British storyline and atmosphere of the movie. Also well known actors like Benicio Del Toro and Dennis Farina fit in very well into the story and the movie in general. But perhaps the biggest positive surprise of the movie was Vinnie Jones. He had been given quite some dialog in this movie and he shows that he really can act. Most movies he plays in, he is given very little dialog, a shame because judging by just this movie, he is a very talented actor.Maybe the movie becomes a bit too complex at times, which is mainly due to the very many characters that play a prominent role in the story. It perhaps gets a bit too much at times but overall it doesn't make the movie any less fun to watch, just more (too much) complicated.The movie has some very fun and original moments in the story, even though the movie is a bit too similar to ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" at times. Which is also the main reason why I still regard ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" as a better movie. It came first and therefor it's more original and refreshing. Basically ""Snatch."" is just more of the same. Not that more of the same is a bad thing in this case but it's just of course not as refreshing and original as with ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" was the case.If you like a well constructed movie with a solid and complex story told from multiple points of views this is a sort of movie that you'll love. Also highly recommendable if you liked ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", of course. I don't mind seeing more movies like this being made.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"Ok, so my preference is definitely Lock Stock - but I have to say, the Hollywood meets UK variety of films is really cool and fun. This film was a great combo of humour and action. Check it out if you haven't already."
"Snatch starts in Antwerp where four guy's dressed as Jewish Rabai's gain entry & steal an 86 carat diamond from a building, one of the gang Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro) smuggles it into London where he plans to sell it to crooked jewellery dealer Doug 'The Head' Denovitz (Mike Reid), however his Russian mates double cross him & informs shady Russian gangster Boris 'The Blade' Yurinov (Rade Serbedzija) who hires two petty criminals Vincent (Robbie Gee) & Sol (Lennie James). Meanwhile boxing promoter Turkish (Jason Statham) & his mate Tommy (Stephen Graham) are in big trouble as they have let down a vicious crime boss named Brick Top (Alan Ford), throw in some Irish pikey's, unlicensed boxing matches, dead bodies, betting shop hold ups & add hard as nails Bullet Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones) hired to sort everything out as everyone's problems become connected...This British American co-production was written & directed by Madonna's other half Guy Ritchie & I'll say it straight away, Snatch is one of my favourite films of all time, period. I must admit after watching it again last night I wasn't looking forward to looking it up on the IMDb for fear of a horribly low score & lots of complaints from people about not understanding or getting it, particularly Americans, so imagine my surprise & delight when I discovered that Snatch is in fact in the IMDb's Top 250 films list (currently #183 but this will change sooner or later) & it certainly isn't a film which I thought would come into most people's heads when talking about the best 200 odd films ever made so I guess it's a testament to just how good Snatch is in that after 7 years from it's original release it still holds a place in the IMDb's Top 250 films of all time. A place, I might add, that I think it fully deserves. 'Who took the jam outta your doughnut?', 'You took the f*cking jam outta my doughnut!'. The script by Ritchie is quite simply the funniest thing ever put to film, I have seen Snatch several times & I still p*ss myself laughing at some of the one-liners, sarcastic jokes, humour, twists, character's & events. Snatch has more quotable lines of dialogue in it than any other film I've seen, I myself have used the 'how did you lose it, it's hardly a set of f*cking car keys' line so many times & never miss an opportunity to use it! The whole film maybe gets a little bit too silly at the end but who cares when it's this clever, this fun, this hilarious & this entertaining? 'What's in the car?', 'Seats and a steering wheel'. I'm sorry, I just love the one-liners in this & can just quote them all day long & not get bored. I love Snatch, I thinks it is absolutely brilliant in every single way from the character's to the clever plot which keeps you on your toes to the hilariously funny dialogue. Snatch is one of the few films about which I simply can't find anything negative to say at all, the absolutely perfect film to watch with some mates on DVD.Director Ritchie pulls out all the stop with an incredibly stylish & fast moving comedy crime thriller, the editing, the camera moves & the dull colour schemes which sum up the British weather perfectly just work like a dream in every respect. There's not much graphic violence although there's loads of profanity & bad language. There's plenty of clever visual gags as well as the funny one-liners & Snatch is just great to both listen to & watch. 'There are two types of balls. There are big brave balls & there are little mincey faggot balls.'With a modest sounding budget of about $10,000,000, well by Hollywood standards it's modest, Snatch has a perfect gloomy British look to it & there's some nice location shooting in & around London. The acting is brilliant from a great cast, everyone plays their roles straight & it's just so funny.Snatch is just about the perfect film, still being in the IMDb Top 250 films is by no means a guarantee of quality but it proves it has legs across a broad range of people most of who I'm pleased to discover get it & love it as much as I do. Guy Ritchie will never make another film as good as Snatch (just look at his next full feature film Swept Away (2002) staring his wife Madonna) & you will never see as good a comedy crime thriller as Snatch, that I promise you."
"Greed. It's everywhere if you just look for it. The fact that the film is called Snatch shows the main theme of the movie. The word ""snatch"" means to seize something in haste, which shows that greed is the motivational factor for all characters in the film. Vinny and Sol's use of fake guns b/c they were cheaper than real ones. The movie ends with the circle of wealth still being passed on to others. Boris shows his greed in the scene where he cuts off Franky's entire arm, he obviously only needed to cut his hand to get the suitcase, but took more than he needed. Recurring instances of pigs show greed also, sausages, Brick Top's pigs, etc. When the dog is given the toy, it greedily swallows it whole. Many instances of fighting for money. The movie has a widely diverse cast, which shows the interaction between cultures for the purpose of trade. Each of the character's names represents a common quality of their individual culture. In most societies, Men are dominant in the making and handling of money. This is why the film has no females in it's cast. Women are shown mostly with wealthy men, possibly possessions of these men. Greed is brilliantly presented in subtle and extreme ways throughout the entire movie. It makes the film more interesting to watch after you think about this."
"What's amazing to me is that American filmmakers keep churning out movies with no plot, bad special effects, terrible dialog, horrible acting, cartoonishly fake fight scenes, and the public simply goes crazy for it. Hollywood is to movies what fast food is to fine cuisine.Here is a great British movie that didn't get a lot of hype. It's fresh, different, edgy, and creative. Why Guy Ritchie didn't do more like this I couldn't guess (Lock, stock & 2 smoking barrels is also a must see). Unlike most American movies, the acting is all around phenomenal, but the best performances go to the actors playing Brick Top & Bullet Tooth Tony. The story has so many twists and it'll keep you guessing until the end. The humor in this is very dark, & the film has a certain ""grittiness"" to it that is perfect for the story & characters.Do yourself a favor, & check this out. You won't be disappointed."
"I honestly never really cared of Guy Richie and had no intention of ever trying to see anything he did, I mean the guy's married to Maddona.Snatch is one of those rare movies that you can easily pick up and watch over and over again. Not since Pulp Fiction have I ever been able to watch a movie and laugh at the jokes Every time I watch it. Yes, for those of you who haven't seen it, Snatch is very funny. Filled with very memorable characters, very creative direction and editing and top notch performances from everyone involved, Snatch is very easy to recommend and is a riot when watching it with friends (Who have very dark tastes.) Go and watch this movie today if possible 10 out of 10."
"I really looked forward to watching Snatch. Not only was it from the director of 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels', one of my favourite UK movies of all time, but it had Brad Pitt in, who since Twelve Monkeys and Fight Club is my numero uno cool actor.But I ended up greeting many of the attempts at humour with a stoney face, found some of the images (notably the one with the body bags) just gross and distasteful and the entire plot lacking in the FUN that had been Lock, Stock.The plot didn't seem to weave as much - the diamond changed hands predictably, the comedy dog wasn't and some of the gags were so...sitcom-like. Ooooh...a fat man having trouble getting out the car.The characters were bad too. Ah, he has a cockney accent that's all  we need to know about him. Ah, everyone f***ing hates Pikies. That's funny repetition.The violence didn't fit with the cheeky style the film attempted...It makes me angry to think how much better Lock, Stock is. And it's a warning to ppl making a 'next' movie - change the plot, setting, chracters, tone, etc. so that comparisons between two movies are left abstract.Snatch is the half-backed sequel to Lock, Stock. But Ritchie sold out earlier than Lucas. If you look carefully you can see Ewoks everywhere.....or is it just lack of originality?"
"That's the only way I can explain these rave reviews and 8.2 average. Because if you come into the movie actually looking for a great story with great acting and diverse, interesting characters, well, you won't get it. But if you've decided you like ""hip, cool, wise cracking British gangsters"" and Guy Ritchie's ADD style of directing before you even sit down, then you'll decide this is just what you thought it would be, and give it a 10.That's the only way I can fathom how people thought this was a great movie, let alone a good movie. I mean, if you take every cliché ever put into a gangster film and rehash it with tommy gun rapidity, that's the first 15 minutes of Snatch. And it just keeps going, and going. I got so bored with it, I stopped watching. So maybe it's really great in the end? I doubt it..."
"Snatch is definitely much better than Ritchies first movie ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and is one of the most underrated films ever. I don't know why no one has ever seen this movie, its gotta be up there with some of the funnest, and most creative movies ever. Its fast the whole time, you never get bored, it has a good mix of action and dialogue. Its one of the coolest movies you'll ever see. Go out, rent it, and then buy it. Its better than any other below the belt action movies you can get. Its funny, smart, and there is really no other movie like it. The acting is good, story is even better, Ritchie is one of the best new directors and everyone should go out and see his movies. Go out and buy this movie before it disappears, you wont be sorry"
"I thought this movie was really entertaining . It really kept me interested the whole time . It was packed with loads of action , and also had some laugh out load humor . Brad Pitt once again stole the screen as a Irish fast talking gypsy . He did an amazing job . Snatch is one of the coolest movies of this generation . It was also a very comical movie . The whole plot of the story really grabs your attention from the get go . I loved the action and I loved the realistic feel of the movie , it wasn't some fake movie it made me feel like it was real life . This movie will keep you entertained throughout the whole thing and will make you laugh .Tava"
"SNATCH (2000) Director Guy Ritchie flix this must have movie into the South - English culture with brutal gangsters and one punching taters.Brad Pitt, Jason Statham, Benicio del Toro, Dennis Farina and Vinnie Jones, all this good actors operates in this violent crime comedy that really entertians you! Depressive and smartass mood twisted into a state of mind of strong language and rough'n'tough characters. Explosive with its brutal way of telling its story. Benicio del Toro and Brad Pitt steals much of the show with their two indispensable parts of the movie (though del Toro's not too big). It may have some things like remind you off Fight Club and stuff, but it is without doubt very much the same of Ritchie's other English gangster movie Lock, Stock and Two smoking Barrels (also with Vinnie Jones). The story is fast and very nice put together where you switch cameras sometimes and may in the background you can see things happening in the other camera view, very good Guy!Statham is great and together with his partner Tommy they work for a brtual and disgusting gangster boss. They hire Mickey, a hard punching man living off selling caravans and loves his mum. We also get too mett Franky Four Fingers that are coming over from USA with some heavy diamonds...and more like that stuff... It is all about it's tagline: Stealin' stones Breakin' bones STARS: **** 4/5 (fast, violent and ugly)"
"""Snatch"" is a British English-language film from 2000, so it is already over 15 years old. The writer and director is Guy Ritchie and this film came out shortly before he married Madonna. The cast includes many known names, such as Oscar winners Brad Pitt and Benicio Del Toro, action film superstar Jason Statham, the late Dennis Farina and former football player Vinnie Jones. This 105-minute is as fast as it gets for a film and this is certainly not to everybody's liking (including myself). I found the camera work (i.e. the constant switches and movements) fairly distracting. The characters are all very much in your face, so Ritchie and the actors definitely wanted to make sure you remember them. But how about writing them properly instead? Giving them interesting background stories and making them memorable this (much more subtle) way? Now that would be something, wouldn't it? And that also certainly requires much more skill when it comes to writing screenplays compared to just letting everybody shout at each other for the entire film, even if the path Ritchie took at least resulted in a handful fairly memorable quotes.In the heart of a story there is a precious (priceless actually) diamond most of the characters are after. And with characters, I could also say criminals as absolutely everybody in here has gotten his hands dirty one way or another. This includes all kinds of robberies, brawls, illegal fighting, blackmailing and even murder. The latter also includes the scene I found the funniest. (Actually I did not find too many scenes funny in here I have to admit, it mostly seemed pretty try-hard to me.) I am talking about a scene where one guy shoots another and the guy hit by the bullet keeps insulting the guy who shot at him. And this goes on and on. Another bullet, another insult, another shot, another insult etc. He just didn't want to die it seems and told him frankly and openly what he thought of him. This scene was laugh-out-loud hilarious. But it was really the only one and there aren't too many entertaining sequences in here. Still, comedy was probably the film's biggest strength as storytelling and character development were really weak in my opinion. Ritchie had a fairly decent cast here and I found it pretty underwhelming what he made of it. This film is actually among the IMDb top250 films and this is truly baffling as this film does not have any substance (besides drugs) or depth whatsoever. I guess this film has many fanboys rooting for it (I believe it actually is a very male-oriented film with the cast and story) and these do not care about all the important aspects I already mentioned that this film lacks. I personally give it a thumbs-down. Not recommended."
"MAJOR SPOILERYou know what I'm talking about, the kind of films in which people get killed and no one bats an eyelid, when did the term ""black comedy"" suddenly mean that it was alright to kill a man in you're film and laugh about it. It reminded me of a scene in The Simpsons (yes, I'm quoting the Simpsons, it's a lot more intelligent than anything Guy Ritchie can come up with), when Marge and Lisa are watching an episode of McBain, and McBain snaps a mans neck - Marge says, ""Now that's what I call breakneck speed"", to which Lisa glibly replays ""Mom, a man just died""... If only Guy Ritchie had, had a little Lisa Simpson sitting next to him whilst he wrote this script. But that's not the worst part, Ritchie does actually include a couple of very sinister murders e.g. When Mickey's (Brad Pitt) mother is burned alive, there terrible, because the rest of the film is so empty, what is Ritchie trying to do - if the intention of the film was to be light hearted then don't put in the hard stuff. Well I suppose Snatch is better than Lock Stock, which means perhaps one day Ritchie will make a decent film, and stop destroying the memory of Pulp Fiction with these lame cockney Tarantino rip-offs.4/10"
"I bet screenwriters and directors who have studied their craft wouldn't be caught dead in a men's room with Guy Ritchie. How wonderful for Mr. Ritchie to get his foot in the door because his daddy knew someone in the business. That doesn't mean Mr. Ritchie is talented, folks. It just means he has connections. Which brings me to SNATCH. SNATCH'S target audience is adolescent boys because this is an adolescent movie. So, if you are not an adolescent boy, don't waste your time and electricity watching this movie despite the talented actors who signed on to collect monies to pay their bills.That being said, IMDb's Guy Ritchie biographer quotes Ritchie as saying, ""He never attended film school, saying that the work of film school graduates was boring and unwatchable."" Really? Isn't that the pot calling the kettle black?"
"This was an amazing movie. The dialogue was extremely witty and tied in with the acting perfectly. There is an element of hilarity which will also appeal to a lot of people. Not a single actor in this movie was bad, each person played their role perfectly. The different cultures were portrayed perfectly and the acting reflects on that. Another really cool aspect of the movie were the wonderfully colorful names that each character gets. They alone contribute to the culture.It's amazing how the entire movie revolves around one pivotal moment in the beginning but then branches out into the matrix of stories that are all entwined and then brought back together in the end.This is the epitome of a good movie, great acting, great actors, great story, great culture, great dialogue. ""Snatch"" has it all."
"Spoilers herein.This kind of film superficially resembles what I really yearn for: heavy cinematic qualities in the filmmaking. I look for a harmony of vision among how the camera is managed, the edits are composed, the music punctuates the image. Snatch has this, and sustains a pace almost frenetically conducted. I was really impressed with the effectiveness of style that was pulled off here.But the reason I yearn for this is because of the power that can result when these cinematic skills are put to the service of climbing into one's mind. Few things are as powerful at the social level than such films. The written word goes deeper, but film is more visceral. So I have to ask in the service of what art was all this Snatch motion created? And I think in this case, the flash alone was intended to be the only justification.
That's not good enough for me. This film is an interesting empty vessel. In contrast, the first Mr Madonna isn't afraid of life. We're better off with him. Less style, but more substance, the stuff our brains and nerves eat.Kudos though to Brad Pitt. Even though this film is a waste for him, he is on a laudable journey to plumb many non-mainstream niches, while eluding the fate of Julia. He's taking real risks here, and I expect we will all be better for it."
"Apart from Brad Pitt this film is average beyond belief.  How long are we going tolerate bad English Gangster films. Jason Stratham is awful in this. How can he possibly be a leading actor with zero charisma and acting ability??? Ze Germans - What is that all about? It's not funny or even explicable - Stop it now!Mr Ritchie should make something different (preferably without Pearly Kings et al) - the darker side of this film is well done - perhaps a horror film or something with less unfunny comedy would suit him.Ritchie has talent but his obsession with faux cockney gangsters is not impressive.  He has the ability to make a good a film, I just haven't seen it yet."
"""Snatch"" may well be the worst movie I have seen over the past 12 months. Who ever told Guy Ritchie he can direct? Probably the same person who told him Madonna would make a good wife.There are so many places where this film went wrong, I don't know where to begin. But, I'll give it a shot.1. The movie is just too slow. Ritchie certainly is taking us for a wild ride, but the pace is almost as slow as an 80-year-old grandmother driving on the interstate. Ritchie spends too much time spinning his wheels before moving on.2. MTV-Style cinematography. Nothing really wrong with this, provide it is actually used to further the story and the pace of the film. But Ritchie uses it as a gimmick. His lame attemps to dazzle me actually bored me.3. The use of ""ethnic types"" and ""ethnic humor."" Again, I have nothing against the use of ethnic humor or the use of race, provided it is not done in a mean spirited manner. Ritchie doesn't cross the line, but he does tread it. Actually, from his portrayals I can see that Ritchie's knowledge of ethnicity is limited to whatever is white Anglo-Saxon Protestant. His use of ethnic humor makes Ritchie look like an idiot.4. Eccentric characters. I love to see really eccentric characters in movies. But again, this is something Ritchie can't handle. Half his characters aren't eccentric enough, and the rest go so far off the deep end that they are not even credible, just one-dimensional. Its as if Ritchie is trying too hard. Also there is a lack of ""normal"" characters for the eccentrics to play off of.The only positive thing I can say about ""Snatch"" is that this is the best acting I have ever seen from Brad Pitt. He totally disappeared into his character. Unfortunately, even with Pitt ""Snatch"" is not worth the time or money to see."
"This movie had one flaw...Diction. The britsh was so cockney I couldn't understand a word they were saying. But other than that it was badass. It worked so perfectly. The story, the way it was filmed was totally flawless. It was boss. Jason Statham was very good in this movie. I was quite enjoying the depth in characters. Thats what I love in movies. I can't believe they put Brad Pitt in this. All together this was a brilliant. I love Guy Richie movies. Perfect Cast. Perfect Story. Perfectly Filmed. See it and be amazed. ********************************* out of *************************************."
"that they see it snatch the Vincent is a gardener who who is at, Brad Pitt who does not early do what that. When a stone snatch is stolen, Pitt is ended on a bar rule. The way it returns is: this. Vinnie Jones is a hard nut slamming heads in doors again!! then. what does that guy have to say when he does it. of that. What a melon, moustache buns, stolen a 9-carat stone what is. then the routes are blocked by a reads vengeance. Sol,Vinnie and Dezz. who don't do i!!? . when he does not Mickey the Irish boxer. the dog Daisy is the one who does it all. when what happens happens to Boris the blade. Overall the film is a great masterpiece from Guy Ritchie and i recommend it to everyone who likes cockney gangster movies."
"Are you serious that this movie currently has a user rating over 7.9????I feel asleep on this movie, obviously I have no idea what other people see in this movie..EEH"
"... @rse.""Lock, Stock... "" only needed to be 'mildly entertaining' to make waves in the Brit film industry, ""Snatch"" doesn't even come close to acheiving that modest target.  All of the same elements but this time none of the surprise. Guy Ritchie obviously easily confuses 'homage' with 'rip-off'.  Right down to the blatent shoehorning of Madonna's ""Lucky Star"" onto the soundtrack simply because of the well-known connection, his only abilities seem to lie in bombarding the audience with the obvious at every turn.  Even Brad Pitt effortlessly stealing each scene he appears in cannot save this awful, awful film from complete 1-star ignominy.I'm truly horrified that this has been voted into the IMDB Top 250."
"SPOILERS:: I cannot discuss my reaction to ""Snatch"" (which I suppose relates to the ""snatching"" of the large diamond) without commenting on the Imdb ratings. Currently it is #142 with a rating of 8.1, primarily by virtue of most voters being under 29, and I suspect most under 21. Among the ""over 30"" crowd, the rating is 7.5, which seems to me just about right. In many respects it deserves highest ratings for style, action, witty dialog. But the story, which is a bit convoluted and which involves all bad guys, as in ""Lock, Stock..."", is a rather poor one. As one professional reviewer said, ""Guy Ritchie doesn't really want us to care about the story, it's all about the action.""My main interest in seeing the movie was Brad Pitt. From the trailers, I was intrigued by his gypsy character, a bare-fist fighting champion who only needs one punch.  I think his performance is the highlight of the entire film, and again Pitt shows, as he did in ""Fight Club"" and ""Twelve Monkeys"", that he is one of the better and more versatile males actors.
James Barardinelli and Roger Ebert have excellent summaries of the film. For highlights, I really thought the dog swallowing the squeek toy, and ""squeek-barking"" was funny, as was ""Something to declare? Yes, don't go to England."" Much of the dark humor in ""Snatch"" arises from the ineptitude of the various crooks. If they were serious, competent crooks, then the film would not be very interesting. ""Slapstick Crooks"" would be a better name.The camerawork and editing, as well as the dynamic 5-channel sound, were all first-rate. Ritchie is certainly in a different league there. I will keep watching his films for their entertainment value, but it would be easy to criticize him for all the violence, a la ""Pulp Fiction"", and pervasive use of foul language.  We just have to remind ourselves, ""It's only a movie."""
"What a complete waste of time. Reminded me of Tarantino films (Death Proof, Dusk to Dawn, Kill Bill) etc.: sick and horribly overrated.I just don't understand why anyone would like this type of film. It is gratuitously violent, extremely foul-mouthed, totally unrealistic, you can not understand much of the dialog, has a stupid story line, etc.This type of film (add Goodfellows, etc.) appeals mostly, but not exclusively, to immature young men who most likely suffer from sexual dysfunction and the ""tyranny of being cool."" This film's plot is nonsense and not at all funny; the only smile that one may get is from their cutesy names. The characters are overdrawn and not even interesting enough to be pathetic. The viewer has no sympathy for any of the characters because they have no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Chewbacca is more interesting than anyone in this film.Rating this in the top 2,000 would be inexplicable, let alone in the top 200. This shouldn't surprise me; IMDb users put Pulp Fiction in the top 10 and Scarface in the top 200; I wouldn't put any of these films in the top 1,000. Rent a Kazan film and don't waste your time on Ritchie (or Tarantino for that matter)."
"For anyone who holds any love for the English accent, steer clear of this film; Statham's performance simply crucifies it and he's by no means the only performer guilty of this crime. I'd have been more convinced had the casting directors pulled people off the streets of London and that's no joke, so to have Statham narrating throughout was a painful experience. This fundamental flaw left the whole film difficult to take seriously and moments that were clearly meant to be funny were simply awkward.Brad Pitt's performance, however, was excellent - although he barely features.3 out of 10"
"In the gutter and looking down,that's ""Snatch"".Obviously its extremely violent,foul-mouthed and aimed at blokes under 30 who think Mr Vinnie Jones is the mutt's nuts.Cheap laughs,racism - ""I hate fxxxxx pikeys"" is a constant refrain - abound and the movie continues to demonstrate the director's peculiar sycophancy to the South London demi - monde. One day those Frankie Fraser wannabees are going to get fed up with being portrayed as beetle-browed psychopaths without the wit to stay out of the nick long enough to sit through 15 three minute rounds. Here Mr Ritchie has trawled through the pages of ""Rent an 'ard bastard"" and come up with a ""comic"" cast whose idea of doing comedy is to read their lines like Morecambe and Wise,almost nodding and winking at the audience to let them in on the gag. The worst offender is the aforementioned Mr Jones who,regretfully, displays all the signs of a man who has come to believe his own publicity. The bareknuckle boxing plot has Irish Traveller Mr Brad Pitt outsmarting the crafty cockneys at their own game - not perhaps the most challenging of tasks - and the saga of the big.big,big,big diamond is more than a little reminiscent of Stanley Kramer's early sixties masterpiece but instead of under the Big Dubbleya,the treasure ends up inside a traveller's dog. Best viewed as a twenty - something bloke with a bunch of other twenty - something blokes,belching,breaking wind and necking the Stella as if there was no tomorrow. If that is not your thing I can honestly advise you to give it a wide berth."
"Watching this (often) fast paced movie, I got too much the impression that acting was being overshadowed by all these prominent smart-cuts, transitions from one scene to the next.  The only real joy to watch (acting-wise) was Brad Pitt, playing the gypsy boxer.  Benicio del Toro was a big disappointment as a leading cast for his mere cameo appearance, and a lousy one at that.Calling this movie innovative or ""highly original"" is giving way too little credit to earlier movies like Lola Rennt."
"In 1998, when ""Lock, Stock..."" came out, Ritchie was relatively unknown, and that was part of the charm of the movie.  The comedy was refreshing, evenso with visual effects and story teller tricks;  the great surprise was the ""everyone""-finale.  The movie was an alternative and commercial hit, which is not an everyday achievement.  The conception of ""Snatch"", however, cannot be driven by anything different from commercialism: it is an exact copy of ""Lock, Stock...""; Ritchie didn't even try to hide it.  Plot, characters and effects are exactly alike - to give an example, the only change made to Vinnie Jones' character in ""Lock, Stock..."" is the name.  What makes it even worse, is that Ritchie needs visually not entertaining features (stills, name-tags, arrows) to tell his story.  Two highlights, however, are the performances of Alan Ford and Mike Reid: as evil as can be, and therefore entertaining."
"If there had never existed a Tarantino or a Tony Scott or a Scorsese, one might think that this Director was some kind of Genius. Unfortunately, because there was he isn't. At worst his work is hackneyed, that means...unoriginal, pedestrian, mediocre, poor, tired, stereotyped, banal undistinguished, uninspiredThis is a fan favorite Film and is a retread of his Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels (1998), so he not only rips-off better Directors, he rips-off himself. Its appeal lies in the over the top, inconsequential violence and Male bonding (there is barely a female to be seen or heard), foul language, and razor-sharp-razzle-dazzle editing.The cast is right on the whole thing and make it all seem like subversive fun, but it is really an ugly, offensive, and at best a guilty pleasure for those not wallowing in its supposed hipness, but it is a false front to a backdrop of extremism and excess. The Movie is Artistic shallowness made for the new Millennium. A rather self-conscious disconnect that is disconcerting, but delightfully demonstrates to the fan-base, that the new generation has arrived. Get used to it."
"Snatch is escapism.  It is a movie that does not invest in it's characters, and it tries to be ultra hip.  If you like that sort of thing then see it. If you don't I think you should see ""Sexy Beast"" or the original ""Get Carter.""  Both great British Gangster films."
"I'm going to say it right away,I didn't like the film at all.The film is nothing more than a bunch of cliches which try to be funny but ends up as shallow as possible. I like to laugh however I didn't laugh once in this pretentious film with its camera angles which hide a thin plot and a bad acting from every one involve.The film is nothing more than a bunch of actors who have all kind of what suppose to be ""funny"" accents. If it meant to be a parody than its not a successful one. Beware of this film it's a waste of time not to mention a waste of money."
"After 33 years 8 months and 72 days after my birth and I finally found the movie that could put me right to sleep.  This movie while great with camera angles, directing and lighting was a sad testament to modern cinema.As I began to read a few of the comments that were left by users, I could not believe that this was the same group of people who found that Malcolm X was a 7.2 on a 10 star scale but that this movie was an 8.2.  My God have the standards from 1992 till 2001 fallen that much.Within the first 20 mins I noticed that I was in trouble with this film but thought better of the premium money that it takes to view a movie these days.  Maybe I am wrong in my assessment of this movie, maybe I do not understand the greater good that this movie provided to the world, maybe I can not see the true world as it should be.  I asked my coworker how she had enjoyed the movie as we went to see this disgrace together.  To my surprise, ok my horror, she stated that she loved it and it reflected modern society and what she was used to hearing about in the world....  Oh please tell me she was kidding.  This movie could not be a modern reminder of what we see in everyday life unless of course we are from Columbine or somewhere that people shoot up store fronts and murder people on a daily.  Ok enough of my soap box.  I thought this movie not worthy of the tape that it took to distribute it to my local theater, but then again, that is one mans opinion out of thousands....Someone, please tell me what I am missing here and why I would think of suggesting this movie to someone?"
"An atrocious comedic drama which glamorizes criminal activity, violence, and almost mind-numbingly pervasive profanityI had a hard time finishing it. Rest assured that your potential for gaining new insight or finding life-enriching meaning of any kind is slim to none; you definitely will not be uplifted. Even just measuring it in terms of simple entertainment value, its wit & humor don't come close to compensating for its violence. The kinds of flashy bloodshed and theatrical cruelty which are found in films like Snatch desensitize fragile minds and corrode morals in a way that, yes, does in fact facilitate real-world violence.Brief example: the film's analysis of the efficiencies of pig farms for human corpse disposal - some people inevitably walked away reflecting on the strengths & weaknesses of different corpse disposal methodsa topic in which they would not have otherwise invested mental energy. I just wish we could have more honest conversations with ourselves and each other about the impact the media to which we expose ourselves has on us individually, and on those among us who are most malleable. Not to be preachy, but that there is any real market for this movie ought to be unsettling to those of us who value human life; this film almost entirely implies that it is worthless. Watch something elsethere is plenty of better out there to be seen."
"Possibly the most loathsome film that I have ever had the misfortune of encountering. The script a joke, the direction a joke, the story a joke, characters a joke. Not a joke in the ha ha sense but in the sense that you wish you had more than popcorn to throw at the screen.The main problem with this picture is that it is trying to be something which it is not. A - it tries t be humorous B - it tries to be original and C - it tries to be that great white elephant, cool. Possibly if one hadn't seen Lock Stock... this would have passed the time with a slight modicum of enjoyment. But no, we get a rehashed, regurgitated, reject. The witty raconteur between characters in the ""Bleedin' barrel o' cockney monkeys"" (to quote the Fast Show) style becomes irksome and boring after about five minutes. The characters we have shoved in our faces have all the grace and subtlety of a deranged mongooseBut my main bugbear is the direction. It can only be described as 'CRASH' cinematography. I'll try and explain. 1) Cut from previous scene. 2) Loud music with heavy beat. 3) Man/ woman walking. 4) Said man/ woman stops walking. 5) Said man/ woman says something witty to other character. 6) Other character retorts with something equally witty. 7) Cut to next scene and repeat.When I watch wrestling I may enjoy this style, but I would rather wrestle a bear with an eating disorder than watch this drivel again."
"When I saw the ratings and reviews of the movie, I was really excited to watch it but unfortunately I was a little disappointed. Probably, high level of expectations took this movie down for me. The movie according to me was not very funny. I couldn't spot any good comic punches. To the most, I guess that the British accent was exploited a little too much. The quest for the stone, however was somewhat interesting. Overall, an average movie."
"Let's reconstruct a scene from Quentin Tarantino's highly successful ""Pulp Fiction (1994)."" Samuel L, Jackson and John Travolta are two hit men assigned to wipe out a couple of welshers. In the apartment they shoot two of the kids to death and turn to leave, when a third terrified kid rushes out of the bathroom and empties his pistol at their backs. Jackson and Travolta turn and look at the six bullet holes in the wall behind them -- every shot having missed -- glance quizzically at each other, then wordlessly raise their guns and blow the brains out of the third guy.Now, if that scene was funny, this whole movie is hilarious. It's vastly more stylized, with abundant slow motion, instantaneous cuts, stings on the sound track, and occasional subtitle, as well as a narration by Jason Statham. But, as in ""Pulp Fiction,"" there are multiple narrative threads involving three black thieves, a mock-Jewish conspiracy, a Russian, corrupt boxing matches, and something about a priceless diamond as big as a ping pong ball. For lagniappe, in addition to Quentin Tarantino in excess, we get touches -- or snatches, if you prefer -- of Charlie Chaplin's slapstick, mostly involving a cute sassy mutt with a black patch over one eye. The dog gulps down a squeaky rubber toy and thereafter when barking he also squeaks. Sometimes he only squeaks. Later, after the dog swallows the diamond, the head villain orders him ""opened up"" but the .50 caliber pistol bearing goon who has killed dozens of men is reluctant to shoot the dog.It's full of wisecracks, F-bombs, fast cuts, action, and assorted mishigas, all of which manage to subsume the plot with less difficulty than the dog had swallowing the squeaky rubber toy. The only time I cared about what happened to any of the characters was when the heavies burned Brad Pitt's Mum alive in the caravan -- a dirty trick if you ask me. It may be that Pitt gives the best performance in the sense that, though I could understand only about one word out of five from the normal characters, I could understand nothing at all said by Pitt's Irish tinker. ""Waw may"" is actually ""Why me?"""
"I get that at the time this came out, there weren't legions of such action packed convoluted rougher type comedies, but for crying out loud 'Lock' came out before this, by the same Guy Ritchie, and it was heaps better. If anything, strangely enough, it feels like Lock was the more mature film made some years later, not before.It's not as smooth in the action sequences, it's got too much talking that doesn't amount to much effect, pretty stupid braindead type dialog, supposedly witty but really completely forgettable banal lines, tries hard in many places; something like Brad Pitt's character was good in concept but honestly could've been much funnier in execution, they could've really made him sound hilarious when here he's just confusing to listen to.Where 'Lock' had lots of well incorporated subplots and micro-twists, this here gets overcomplicated too fast, too many characters, and the viewer can't be screwed to put in all that effort to remember insignificant details, as the film never makes it a point to warrant your full attention on every aspect of this very ordinary production. Too much focus demanded for far too little a reward.5.5/10."
"I saw Guy Ritchie's ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and thought it was an extremely disappointing piece of '90s cinema - I specify it was made in the 1990s because it's another one of those Quentin Tarantino rip-offs that borrow his directorial trademarks - the violence punctuated by irony and dark humor, the intertwining stories, the morally dark characters who have no remorse.""Snatch"" is a great deal better. Some people claim it's Guy Ritchie selling out to the American market because it stars Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro and Dennis Farina. If he's ""selling out,"" he's buying something better with the money - this is a lot more fun to watch than ""Two Smoking Barrels."" Simply put, it's directed much better. I felt like ""Barrels"" was a British TV commercial extended to full length - all style over substance. ""Snatch"" has similar style but there's more substance.As for the performances... everyone is great. Del Toro opens the movie with a bank robbery - he steals a precious diamond and tries to sell it. This moves on to Jason Statham, as a boxing promoter, and his story ties into the previous one. This goes on and on and invites new characters into the mix.The standout is of course Brad Pitt. When I lived in England we had Pikeys living around us and they annoyed the hell out of me. They were constantly speeding down our road and stealing stuff. Once they smashed their van through a neighbor's fence, then fled the scene of the accident - as if the police wouldn't figure out who it was.Watching ""Snatch"" I was reminded of this and thought it was particularly memorable because I've never seen a ""Pikey"" in a movie before. Brad Pitt basically mumbles his way through the movie and he and his pack really do come across as genuine Pikeys.I hate to sound like a typical American when I say ""Snatch"" is better than ""Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels,"" but I honestly think the plot, the direction and the acting is superior here. Statham is still great and Pitt is surprisingly effective in his role. The movie is lively and fun to watch, cleverly scripted with good dialogue and although some scenes are reminiscent of Tarantino, the overall product is far better than anything else Ritchie has done - and provides more originality than his other movies, too."
"Wow! Thats basically all I would need to say to describe the film. Guy Ritchie was brilliant to come out with that kind of scenario and the execution was great with good actors (Brad Pitt, Vinnie Jones....). It is not the newest movie but certainly stays in my gold fond for a long time. I cant say that this is the best movie i have seen but competes in no doubt with the best. All the way long the movie kept going and there were not a single moment when I would of thought of taking a leak or making my self a sandwich. In one word my thoughts were all the time in Snatch. Usually the big errors in the execution catch my eye but in a moment i cant remember any that would of had disturbed me. OK i guess i have to see it again then."
"The basic idea of Snatch is that a botched diamond heist leads to a wild and tangled adventure involving gangsters, boxers, and a detailed look at the London underground scene.The film has many story lines that seem to weave in and out of each other so seamlessly that it gives the film a unique style. Explaining the story is a real pig but here goes - The story goes something like this - Franky Four Fingers (Benicio del Toro) arrives in London to deliver a consignment of stolen gems to Doug ""The Head"" (Mike Reid), In the capital, Franky crosses paths with a ""sneaky *beep* Russian"" Boris ""The Blade"" (Rade Serbedzija), who is planning to half-inch the prize diamond for himself while Franky is at the bookies. Unfortunately, Boris's accomplices make a pig's ear of the stick-up, and the rock ends up in the stomach of a deranged mutt.Meanwhile in another plot line would-be boxing promoters Turkish (Jason Statham) and Tommy (Stephen Graham) find themselves in a ""tight spot"" with local kingpin Bricktop (Alan Ford) in a forthcoming illegal boxing match when their fighter is accidentally knocked out by Irish gypsy Mickey O'Neill (Brad Pitt). Unable to cancel the bout, the pair persuades Bricktop to allow them to enter Mickey in place of their injured man. Unfortunately, the ""pikey"" Irishman refuses to obey orders to ""go down in the fourth"", embarrassing Bricktop and his associates and losing him a few bob in the process Unafraid to use bloodshed to make his point, Bricktop exacts a terrible revenge on Mickey's family to stress the point that when he says go down in the fourth, he means it.This film is amazingly more of a cockney comedy than a serious (""the getaway"" game style) London gangster plot. Vinnie Jones excels in the role of a London hard nut it's what he does best and the accomplices of the Russian are brilliantly funny and lighten the dark and gritty reality of the plot considerably A definite work of extreme style form Guy Ritchie with an urban soundtrack to match the plot, this film is a welcome follow-up to ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" which is also worth watching. No offence but this isn't one for heart warming characters or American critics they just don't understand a Great British gangster filmwith Balls!"
"I saw this at a preview showing 5 days before it came out in the UK and am glad I did.  Well what can I say basically 'Snatch' is 'Lock Stock' but with a diamond.  However, don't let this distract you from what is a very funny, well-shot and visually enjoyable film.Guy Ritchie propels the story along with blistering pace trying to fit a fast range of characters and in some cases this can become confusing to who is who and what is what.  In any normal case this would make the film a poorly put together piece however, it is down to Ritchie's exciting visual style, which keeps you, hooked to the brilliant ending.  You certainly won't get bored cause of the amount of images being throw at you, is incredible.This all round down in an astonishing final fist fight involving Brad Pitt, which mixes all the elements before hand into a visual adventure, with every trick included 10 times as good as any fight you will see in 'Fight Club'. All I say is that don't go and see this film and expect to see anything different to 'Lock Stock' in the story department, however, if you liked Ritchie's stylist touches then you will defiantly enjoy this cause it is full of them.  Enjoy."
"It's pretty rare that you see a movie like SNATCH.  This movie hits its audience with action and just about anything else it can think of to throw. Every character is larger than life, and each performance is amazing. With characters like Bullet-Tooth Tony, Boris (the Blade), Freddy Four Fingers, and the unintelligible Mickey, this movie is definitely worth a viewing (or 10)."
"Snatch has been critically acclaimed throughout and has been praised as such a great film with an interesting take on a British crime, involving many characters. However as watching the film, there were many characters but too many where we did not care for them. The plot at times is confusing with these characters all coming together but in the end we do not really care. For a film with a running time of a little over 1 hour 40 minutes, it feels longer than one should. As an ensemble cast, not many stand out except Jason Statham (in a very early role in his career) and Brad Pitt (though not in a good way, speaking with a difficult hard to hearing accent- and wondering why he took this role). Too many characters, and were not interesting, was hard to remember their names as well. What makes it worse is the constant jumping from characters and scenes. Snatch is quite the overrated film and wondering why it is currently in the IMDb top 250 with a rating of 8.3. Also praise with comedy and having humor but nothing into the film is quite at that, where the scenes feel bland and wondering as to what people found funny. Apart from some of the boxing scenes involving Brad Pitt, the scenes with Jason Statham and the last 20 minutes or so, Snatch is not a good recommend."
"This is my first review on this website so bare with me! I was really excited about seeing this film as people had been telling me about it for years. I wasn't really sure what to expect at first, but it soon became clear that it was a fantastic film.The blackmail, the mindless violence, and of course, the cockney slang all made this movie a classic London gangster case. I thought that the camera shots all added to the live effect and made it all the more real.The storyline was fantastic, twisting and turning throughout the whole time. It never once bored me, and all the characters acted to the best the of their abilities, including the star of the show, Brad Pitt.I would recommend this film to anyone who likes London gangster flicks. You will not be let down."
"True, SNATCH does have the wittiest situations and dialog since PULP FICTION. But even that cannot hide the fact that this film looks like a pop music video. I absolutely hated the editing style that gave us the fast motion and the idiotic introduction of every single character. And the style of narrative was a rip off of GOODFELLAS. Brad Pitt was funny, though."
"LS&2SB was a wonderful film.. Came out of nowhere and I loved it.Guy R did a really good job in that one.. He (quite deservedly) must have gotten quite a large ego because of it.Unfortunately though, he let his ego run away with him. Snatch will be a moderatley good late night movie 3-4 years from now, but right now - fuggedaboutit.He tried, as in LS&2SB, to interweave several seemingly disparate stories into the one. Unlike LS&2SB where it worked brilliantly, Snatch just came off as a ""hmm, it worked well last time"" kinda flick..I could go on for ages, but couldn't be bothered as I don't even remember the specifics (saw it last week)."
"i see that this is in the top 250.  i thought it might be in the bottom 250, but i guess they are a lot of brad Pitt fans out there.  i am not here to p*** you off or anything but the guy just cant act. the diction in his lines are so slurred, he tries these impersonations, but believe me he is no Kevin Spacey.as for the movie it depiction of blacks is very cruel, and i was totally bored after Benicio left the screen."
"After a Jewish gangster steals an 86-carat diamond from a jewellery exchange in Antwerp and returns to London, a whole variety of criminals suddenly decide that they want to get their hands on the precious stone and will stop at nothing to get what they want. This sets off the crazy chain of events that provides ""Snatch"" with its highly complicated plot that unfolds at high speed and delivers lots of laughs, snappy dialogue and copious amounts of violence. Its large cast of eccentric characters adds plenty of colour and profanity and the whole piece is so well-written and narrated that any conversational exposition is kept to an absolute minimum.When gambling addict Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro), who'd carried out the heist in Antwerp returns to London and decides that he wants to buy a gun, one of his gang members, who happens to be related to an ex-KGB agent called Boris the Blade (Rade Sherbedgia), puts Franky in touch with his relative who's also a gun dealer. The diamond heist had been masterminded by a shady New York businessman known as Cousin Avi (Dennis Farina) and Franky had been instructed to deliver the diamond to Avi's London associate, Doug the Head (Mike Reid). Knowing this, Boris realizes that he must relieve Franky of the diamond before it can be passed to Doug.Unlicensed boxing promoter Turkish (Jason Statham) arranges for one of his fighters to take part in a match that he's set up with fellow promoter and notorious crime boss Brick Top (Alan Ford) but when his fighter can't compete after being injured in a confrontation with an Irish gypsy called Mickey O'Neil (Brad Pitt), Turkish needs a replacement and the gypsy is the obvious choice. After striking a deal with Mickey and receiving instructions from Brick Top for the gypsy to take a dive in the forth round, the fight goes ahead but doesn't end as planned.Boris the Blade acquires a gun for Franky and offers to waive any payment for it on condition that Franky places a bet for him on a boxing match. Franky agrees to do this at a bookie's that's owned by Brick Top and Boris hires a gang of grossly incompetent criminals to steal the diamond which Franky keeps in a briefcase that's handcuffed to his wrist. Brick Top is not amused by what transpires at his betting shop and in order to save their skins, the gang that Boris hired also go in search of the diamond so that they can steal it for Brick Top. On hearing that Franky had gone missing, Cousin Avi immediately comes to London and he and Doug recruit Bullet Tooth (Vinnie Jones) to use his persuasive powers to locate Franky.Brick Top is a particularly vicious piece of work who imposes his will on other people by the use of threats and extreme violence but when he makes an enemy of Mickey, he completely underestimates the reaction of his adversary and the gypsy community and in so doing, makes the biggest mistake of his life.""Snatch"" is a lot of fun and although the influence of Quentin Tarantino is never far away, it's most noticeable during the diamond heist when the thieves indulge in an extended discussion about the consequences of a mistake made by the Septuagint scholars who incorrectly translated the Hebrew word for ""young woman"" into the Greek word for ""virgin"". Other examples follow when Brick Top gives an extended explanation of the meaning of the word ""nemesis"" and a full description of how effectively pigs can be used to dispose of dead bodies.The whole production is highly stylized and this brilliantly facilitates all the wackiness that's perpetrated by its large-than-life characters who are brought to life in a whole series of crazy, over-the-top performances. Rade Sherbedgia's eccentric facial contortions are a marvellous manifestation of Boris' lunacy, Dennis Farina's constant state of panic highlights Cousin Avi's extreme level of anxiety and Brad Pitt, with a strange hybrid accent that no-one can understand, is absolutely hilarious as the fighter whose actions are so spontaneous that even he doesn't seem to know what he might do next.With its frenetic pace, fast editing and colourful characters, ""Snatch"" is exceptionally energetic, action-packed and so full of humour that watching it becomes a breathless but also tremendously entertaining experience."
"It seems to be about a lot of actors having a ton of fun with throwaway one-liners and double-takes. There's not much story here. This isn't even as well organized as LOCK, STOCK AND 2 SMOKING BARRELS, but it is just as fast-paced and violently wacky. Brad Pitt seems to be crossing his buff bod from FIGHT CLUB with his cheerful madman from 12 MONKEYS. I laughed a lot, and if you are comfortable with not understanding what's happening at all times, you will enjoy it. For those of us who don't speak limey, put the closed-captioning on your TV! (PS: Jason Flemyng FINALLY gets to answer a cellphone towards the end of this film. :) )"
"I was going to watch Snatch a while back but ended up turning it off. When I saw that it is still in the top 100 at imdb, nearly 20 years after its release, I decided to give it another try.Snatch is entertaining enough, I suppose, as it does build suspense and offers several twists and turns. It came out about the time of Fight Club, so my best guess is that there is a large contingent of fight-loving fellows rating films at this site. Lots of blood and gore and dark comedy which oscillates between slapstick and sociopathy.The voice-over style used was of course made popular by Goodfellas (Scorsese) and by now has certainly been seen many times since. The tone of the crime caper, too, is found in movies such as the Ocean series (albeit with much less murder). So maybe Snatch is considered a genre-bending antecedent, sort of a cross between the Coen brothers and Tarantino? Not sure. Not really my kind of thing.I remain mystified by the longevity of the high rating. I mean is this film really supposed to be better than Taxi Driver, Lawrence of Arabia, Double Indemnity, I Ladri di Biciclette...? What may have happened is that most of the 700K+ reviewers of Snatch posted ratings in the brief period after the film´s release in a state of post-viewing euphoria induced by violence-induced adrenalin rushes. Perhaps they were also still riding the testosterone wave of Fight Club."
"I've just watched Snatch and I must say that it is one worst films I've seen in quite some time. The dialogue is terribly sub-Tarantino, the story messy and incoherent, the editing headache inducing and the acting is woeful for such a good cast. The film lacks any depth, not that it aims for any, and the humour that it tries to instill instead is puerile and based mostly around swearing. Having said that though, the film does have some merits. The camerawork is excellent (even if it is excessively flashy and OTT), and the climatic boxing scene is well put together, but aside from that it is a gimmicky mess of a film that wastes the talent that it brought together."
