Reviews
"""The Green Mile"" is one of my favorite Stephen King books and I have read it several times.  I was anxiously anticipating the film version, but was concerned that the emotional impact of the book could not be replicated on screen.  Fortunately this wonderful story was adapted by Frank Darabont, who did such a magnificent job bringing King's ""Shawshank Redemption"" to the screen.  He does the same high quality work with ""The Green Mile"".  The story is faithful to the book, only losing details that were not important to the story anyway.  The casting is superb - every actor is perfectly suited for his role and does an excellent job, although I would like to single out Doug Hutchison.  His portrayal of the detestable Percy is right on the mark and suggests complexities in this character I had not discovered in the book.  The length is about three hours and it seems that critics are complaining about that.  I can't understand the complaints.  The film never drags and is never dull, and it certainly didn't feel three hours long.  The length is needed to tell this story the way it should be told, and the story is so very engrossing.  Best of all, Darabont and the actors bring so much emotion ot the screen, that I cried like a baby through several scenes. ""The Green Mile"" will haunt you."
"i expected this movie to be a normal and i just want to see it for Tom Hanks but as movie goes through i cry,i laugh and there comes a feeling which can't be described in words. i rate this movie as the best i have ever seen. some moments in the movie makes me hold my bed pillow in the tightest ever grip. i can guarantee that this movie will leave an impression in your mind for a long time. i even say that this movie is better than shawshank redemption.fantastic story, brilliant acting,mind boggling feelings and overall an unforgettable drama. if you have watched 1000 movies and not this then your movie watching journey is incomplete.i will also make sure that even my next generation should watch this one."
"The Green Mile is a masterwork. This is film as art, at it's very best. The depth of the cast is extraordinary, with all of the players delivering excellent performances. There is a clear sense here that all involved in the production knew that this was something special, and gave it their all. See this film if you truly enjoy actors giving everything to their craft. Watch for the countless subtleties of expression, and the great power that the cast creates with silence. This is evident in the opening sequence and remains throughout. Above all, Michael Duncan as John Coffey is exceptional. He brings gripping emotion to a unique, fascinating character.The Green Mile should bring you joy, laughter, and if you are like most in the theater this night, tears.BRAVO!"
"Having seen the movie, The Green Mile, and read the novel of the same  name by Stephen King, I am glad to say that the movie stays true to the  book, which in itself is a great read.  I read the book in one setting about a year ago, and after seeing the  movie, I didn't see one scene from the book, or one plot point, left  out. There were a few minor changes from the book but which in no way  detract from either work.  As far as performances, I can imagine many people pointing to Michael  Duncan as John Coffey or Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb as the best  performances of the movie, and they are good, but I would hope that  Michael Jeter would receive recognition for portraying Eduard  Delacroix. He plays Delacroix exactly as I pictured him when I read the  book.  I can very well see why King himself said this is his favorite of the  movies adapted from his novels. It is the only one played out as he had  written it.  I wouldn't compare this movie or the book to (Rita Hayworth and) The  Shawshank Redemption because that would be unfair to both. They are  both great, but are both different. The Green Mile isn't a movie about  hope and friendship, as The Shawshank Redemption was, it is a movie  about a miracle of a man, and the people he affects.  But like The Shawshank Redemption, I give The Green Mile 4 out of 4  stars. Great story, great cast, great look."
"Frank Darabont returns to the directors chair with another adaptation of Stephen Kings novel. The events take place at a death row, the guards call the green mile. The story is a layered, rather character-driven fantasy tale of the events that transpire at ""the mile"" after the arrival of a giant man, John Coffey (Michael Duncan), convicted of the murder of two small girls. Actually this is not one single story, but several tied together seamlessly.A character-driven movie requires a lot from the cast, and fortunately when it comes to cast, The Green Mile delivers. As the poster of the movie tells, this movie stars Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb, senior prison guard of the mile, and as always he performs very well indeed. Yet the cast around him is even more spectacular, perhaps partially due to them being relatively unknown. With a face you know, one inevitably remembers previous performances, and the new role is coloured by this.  Doug Hutchison as Percy Wetmore, a mean spirited prison guard was particularly impressive, yet his character could have been given more depth. The most captivating was the performance of Michael Duncan.It is hard to find a flaw in this movie. The camerawork is superb, cast wonderful and direction flawless. The movie's considerable length, a bit over three hours, is something that had me worried. Yet the marvellous cast and the peaceful yet firm pace of the movie held my attention progressively through the three hours right to the touching culmination. Many will find this movie to be too long, but I for one was delighted of the style, combination of simplicity of events and depth of characters and conversation.All in all the The Green Mile is a very touching drama, with the joys and sorrows of the life pictured with great skill, if not the best movie of the year. Five out of five."
"THE GREEN MILE (1999) ****Starring: Tom Hanks, David Morse, Michael Clarke Duncan, Bonnie Hunt, James Cromwell, Michael Jeter, Doug Hutchison, and Gary Sinise Written and directed by Frank Darabont. Running Time: 180 minutes. Rated R (for scenes of strong disturbing violence, language, and some sexuality)
By Blake French:	It's not everyday that a movie is able to change an audiences opinion on something. ""The Green Mile"" is a movie that made me think long and hard about supporting the death penalty. The film, based on a novel by  Stephen King, contains such a variety of emotional events that it repels its audience away from its subject rather than glamorizing it. Only a handful of recent productions have been capable of such power. ""The Green Mile"" is truly one of the best films this year and is Oscar Worthy in many categories. It is a unique, three hour experience that must be seen to believe.  The story is more of a personal narrative than an actual plot. The film offers an interesting perspective of the events that take place. It is seen through the eyes of a man who is over one hundred years of age, Paul Edgecomb, who is currently living in an old folks home with his friend, Elaine. During a very emotional day for Paul, he tells Elaine of a historical year in his experiences. She listens closely to his story.He tells of a particular year in the 1930's. The setting is a beautifully crafted prison hall. Paul explains he used to be a kind prison guard on death row in charge of overseeing the executions. In this year, several significant activities occurred in his life: he had a terribly painful urinary infection, and met a prisoner named John Coffey. This man has been sentenced to the electric chair for the rape and murder of two innocent little girls. This man isn't like anyone else Paul has seen, however. Aside from being massive in size, he is humble, mild mannered, and caring. After several miraculous events take place that may point to the thought that John Coffey might have magical powers from God, Paul begins to doubt the crimes this so called criminal has been convicted of. 	Throughout the story we witness three executions that in an electric chair. These capital punishment sequences have much power and significance. The electrocutions, one in particular, contain some of the most unsettling, disturbing material in film history. The movie is anti death penalty; we see the sometimes sadistic world from the prisoner guards point of view. It will put you in their shoes--and perhaps, change your opinion on the death penalty. I certainly had to think about my stand on this issue.
I did have questions that were not really answered by the filmmakers. I wanted more on John Coffey's magical powers; the miracles aren't investigated enough to suit our pleas. I think the movie could have also stood on a firmer platform of religion. We assume that Coffey's abilities are a gift from God from the character's dialogue, but religion itself is more of a theme in the film than a message or plot point. I can perfectly see why the writers decided to leave these elements to the audiences imagination, to provoke participation. So I suppose my objections are not really flaws, just personal aspirations.""The Green Mile"" contains so many vivid performances, I will not be able to honor everyone who deserves credit in my review. Michael Jeter, Gary Sinise, Doug Hutchison, James Cromwell, Bonnie Hunt, and David Morse are all superior in strength of their characters. Each contributes Oscar worthy performances, and if the Academy leaves these individuals out at Award time, they need to recheck their databases. Michael Clarke Duncan recently received a Golden Globe nomination for his supporting role, and he deserves it. Tom Hanks is just unspeakably brilliant in the leading role. He is right behind Kevin Spacey from ""American Beauty"" in the best performance of 1999. 
The message to ""The Green Mile"" is clear and understandable: justice isn't always just and the miracles can happen in the most unexpected of places. This film is one of the most penetrating dramas of the past several years. It will induce your mind to think about its subjects, and gradually build on you. ""The Green Mile"" is a movie that will stick with you long after the ending credits role by. Brought to you by Warner Bros."
"The length of the movie was perfect. It kept to the story to an amazing degree. The few changes didn't hurt the feeling nor the telling. The story itself is stirring and captivating. The casting of the parts and their portrayal were right on. This is one of the best movie versions of a Steven King novel I've ever seen, and I think I've seen them all. If you're prone to tears at a film, take extra tissues, you'll need them. The theater I was in was a mass of sniffles through the end credits. If you like fantasy/drama the film cannot be missed. There are some graphic scenes that may upset some, but this is Steven King. This is a movie I plan to add to my video collection as soon as the Letter Box version hits the shelves."
"This movie is a real gem.  It is hard to find fault with it.  Hanks is excellent in a role that clearly calls for him to suppress his natural slant toward humor.  He is Paul Edgecomb; Tom Hanks is nowhere to be found.  Yet he gives Edgecomb just the right flavor.  One cannot find a single weak cast member!  Michael Jeter should have got an Oscar.  Michael Clark Duncan put just the right shading on his huge character to make him vulnerable and sympathetic.Flawlessly shot on perfect period sets, the whole production binds together to bring the extraordinary story into the realm of a believable and compelling study of human injustice and charity."
"Without using all the old cliches, I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in a creative, intriguing, and life enhancing experience. Everything about this movie was delightful. I recommend seeing this movie with someone especially close to you. After the movie my Fiancée and I spent two hours talking and expanding on the films ideas and concepts. This was truly a electrifying experience. I would venture to call this movie one of the best movies of all time.  Sure, there are things that I would have liked to see done differently, but that is what makes a movie more enjoyable. The discussions following this film were wonderful."
"There's a reason why this Oscar winning tour de force is #67 ranked of all films on IMDb, despite the fact that it's 3 hours long and has some truly grisly scenes (not for the squeamish, children, or a first date.)It's chock full of outstanding performances, not only from Hanks, but also from the many supporting characters, all who are rich and full. It will seem slow to the impatient, but will be richly rewarding for those with the stamina to make it to the end. It will certainly get you thinking about capital punishment and perhaps different shades/degrees of evil. It is either a deeply moving spiritual tale or a wonderfully creepy journey down the rabbit hole of Stephen King's mind; take your pick. Either way, I put it right up there on my desert island list with the likes of Shawshank Redemption. It is definitely required watching."
"I went looking for an experience. Something that would take me to the limits of my own existence and remind me that even in the darkest corner of my own life, there was hope. I was reminded, instead that along with the triumph there must also be sacrifice. A part of me died in that theater, but I walked out feeling renewed, refreshed...and a little cursed.I think Paul Edgecomb feels the same way.Tom Hanks has to be the epitome of a Hollywood living legend...and the guy's only in his 40s. He went from scraping his way through sophomoric slap like The 'Burbs, Turner & Hooch, and Bachelor Party to rise up in the 90s as our towering ""everyman.""  Anyone who marvels in his ""simple guy in complicated circumstances"" roles such as Forrest Gump and Saving Private Ryan knows that he can deliver the goods...and an Oscar nomination (or win...or two...in aROW!!!)  But Tom does something very interesting in The Green Mile.  He lays back.The breakout performance in this film goes to Michael Clark Duncan (right now tied with Sixth Sense's Haley Joel Osment for my Best Supporting Actor vote).  Crippled by his size, Mr. Duncan has a limit of the roles he can play. However, given the role of a child-like behemoth with Christ-like powers of healing, Duncan brings to the screen a performance that will transcend the Denzels and the Poitiers of the world.The Green Mile is Cell Block E in a Louisiana State Prison, death row. Paul Edgecomb run this wing with compassion, a startlingly different approach considering the legendary cruelty of southern prisons.  He is surrounded by men in him employ who all share his philosophy that these men ultimately await the most devastating punishment.  Why make their stay any more troubling.All save one: Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchinson), relative of the Governor and always ready to remind anyone who disagrees his HIS methods just who got him his job. Percy hates everything about The Green Mile; the prisoners, other guards, even a tiny, brave mouse who befriends one of the inmates (Michael Jeter).  It isn't until another new inmate is processed, a man they call ""Wild Bill"", that Percy will meet his equal.So where is the common thread? What is a messianic character doing on death row? What role will Tom Hanks play in his redemption? And what's this ""curse"" thing I brought up in the beginning of this review?If I could tell you, you wouldn't slap the money down on the box office and find it for yourself.  Let me just tell you that the final blessings bestowed by John Coffey (Duncan) could make optimists and pessimists alike find a common ground. How you perceive the final moments will be up to how you impart on yourself...and the world.If John Coffey guilty of his crime?  Are the fates of the characters in this film deserved?  Half and half.  Evil is punished, bu t goodness must bare witness...and that has a price as well.  Will Tom Hanks win another Academy Award?  He shouldn't.  Is this a good film?  No.  It's an incredible film.I still weep for Paul Edgecomb."
"This movie goes beyond others into an elite group with movies like Facing The Giants, Good Will Hunting, Men Of Honor and others; in which the story is so brilliant and takes you to a climax higher than the usual, that it baffles you to think that there exist possibility in the human mind to create such a story. Kind of like songs, in which there are songs so brilliantly written that you can't imagine a human being writing it.I love drama, they're my favorites and I don't get bored with them especially when it's interesting; so the length, which is something complained about by a lot of people with this movie, doesn't bother me at all it just adds more interest.One of the best movies of all time and a must see! 10/10 without a doubt."
"GREATEST FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN. i remember seeing it when it first came out when i was 12 years old. now i just finished watching it and have gone through practically a whole box of tissues...that pure, love and honesty was portrayed so exquisitely well by Michael Clarke Duncan... it made me want to tear my hair out. If there is anything in this world which reminds me of true human love and compassion, it is this film. If you ever give up hope on humanity and the destruction which our disgusting race has brought to this world, watch ""The Green Mile"" Hopefully it will change your outlook a little bit like it just has mine.11/10 SHOULD HAVE WON ALL THE AWARDS AVAILABLE THE YEAR OF IT'S RELEASE."
"Having doubts about seeing this movie because of the length (3 hours can be death to a film).I was so surprised that I didn't look at my watch once throughout the whole movie. Tom Hanks, in my opinion, gave the performance of his career by bringing emotion and depth to his part. The only actor that bettered him was Michael Clarke Duncan. How he made this giant like character into a vulnerable pussycat was a marvel. On whole, the cast came together and gave the best performance I have seen in a movie for a long time. Not one of them let the side down by being weak. David Morse who is more known for his supporting roles was also excellent and hopefully not long till he's carrying his own movie. If you haven't seen this get it out now,forget about the running time and connections to 'The Shawshank Redemption' and enjoy it for what it is, a little miracle. 4 out of 5"
"The Shawshank Redemption is possibly my favorite movie ever. I had seen many movies before it, and I've certainly seen a lot after, but not many of them made me feel what that one did. Now, I have that feeling again. And once again, it comes from watching a Frank Darabont movie. I couldn't possibly explain the overload of emotions I experienced in the 3 hours it lasts. I have laughed. I have felt the emotions of every character. And most of all, I have cried. Very few movies have touched me like this one. Is there something to say about the acting that hasn't been said before? No, it isn't. You may have heard it is flawless, incredible, whatever. You did hear right, it absolutely is. I can't think of anyone in the whole movie that wasn't convincing in the least. The script has its funny moments, but it's incredibly deep, poignant and heartfelt. The characters are so ""human"" and unpretentious you can't help but adore them. But, well, there will be some you'd like to strangle. There has to be a villain everywhere, right? The Green Mile is a movie I will hardly forget. You can't possibly forget such an emotive story.What, you want to watch it? Great! But don't forget to have grab some tissues first."
"The world is teeming with wretched prisons wherein all manner of men are housed. Because these men are said to have committed a crime, the places are manifest and most men serving there, have earned their stay. However, as history has shown, there are innocent men incarcerated as well. Occasionally, one of these innocents are not only imprisoned, but are further remembered because their life becomes legend. In this case, the realization is nothing short of incredible as the new prisoner is a natural empath. Steven King the prolific American horror writer, chronicles this unusual story in a Louisanna prison where one Joe Coffee, (Michael Clarke Duncan) a huge, nay, enormous Black man, having been convicted of murder, is sentenced to be executed, by electrocution. Tom Hanks( And Dabbs Greer) plays Paul Edgecomb, an aging Prison Guard, who recalls his years in the state prison. Working on 'Death Row' or "" The Green Mile "", Mr. Edgecomb recalls Mr. Coffee's arrival and the strange events during his stay. With sympathetic Guards, like Brutus Howell (David Morse), Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper), Harry Terwilliger (Jeffery Demunn and one particular sadistic guard called Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison), Edgecomb recollects his discovery of the man's unusual healing powers and the surprising revelations concerning his innocence. The story is crafted by Steven King and it's application to the silver screen is perhaps one of the finest adaptation ever done. Duncan is magnificent and has a superb ability to allow the audience to learn his true purpose. Were it not for the sadistic behavior of Hutchison, who earned his ultimate reward, the story would not have carried it's genuine sympathetic awe which gave this movie it's Classic status. A great film and a must for true movie fans. ****"
"In every way, this is a wonderful film and IMO deserves a rare 10/10 because it's hard personally for me to see how it could have been made any better. Hugely touching, emotive on every human level, a brilliant storyline, by all accounts a faithful screenplay and wonderfully cast. It's long, but the time flies.Hanks is superb here as is the inspired choice of Michael Clarke Duncan and in fact all of the cast. Even the mouse was brilliant!SPOILERS:It's the story of a simple man wrongly convicted of the worst type of crime. Set in a time where there is no real recourse to justice for such men and with a subplot that becomes the main focus of the film. Is John Coffey a gift from God and if so why are we allowing him to be legally murdered? That he ultimately doesn't mind, doesn't ease Paul's pain or the viewers pain at what we are watchingBoth Bitterbuck and Delacroix will make you question the death penaltyPercy's grossly offensive behaviour will make you question your humanity Paul Edgecomb will make you realise what a fantastically emotive actor Tom Hanks is and Duncan's John Coffey will make you weepHats off to you Mr Darabont once again and thank you for a truly beautiful film."
"What an excellent movie this picture was. When I first saw the trailers in October, I thought it might be pretty good.The Green Mile exceeded my expectations. Tom Hanks leads a wonderful cast in this movie which stands out by far from most others. If you liked Shawshank Redemption, you'll love this one.  I've realized just how good Stephen King can write, now that I've seen this and Shawshank.  It's three hours long, and worth every minute of it.  It touched me in many ways.  I was fortunate enough to see it twice. And I will buy it on dvd as soon as it is available. The Green Mile will certainly become a classic. Go see it, you won't be disappointed."
"I'm glad that a number of reviewers have informed me that this highly unusual tale was a faithful adaption from the novel by Stephen King. I'm not much of a fiction reader so it is gratifying to hear that his vision got to the screen intact. I would not have guessed this film would have come from a horror story writer. No monsters from the id or any place else are present in this story set in the American South of the Thirties. But demons do exist in The Green Mile and there is a man named John Coffey who takes them unto himself.The Green Mile refers to the cell block housing the inmates scheduled for Death Row. In that cell block comes Michael Clarke Duncan who is close to seven feet tall and maybe weighing 400 pounds. He's also as docile as a baby lamb and whose only request is that they leave a night light burning because he gets a little afraid of a strange place in the dark.Of course the guards who have the typical white Alabama attitudes of the day don't quite know what to make of them, but Tom Hanks who captains the cell block and most of the rest find out just how special he is. And Hanks cannot believe that someone like Duncan could possibly be guilty of a double rape/murder of a child.This modern day parable of the Jesus story has King telling us that it is very possible that many of his kind have walked the earth with talents for healing. One of them got a religion worked around him, but they can come in all walks of life and certainly no one would expect one to come in the guise of an illiterate black Alabama sharecropper. But one of my favorite Bible verses has Jesus himself saying that what you do unto the least of my brethren you do unto me.Somebody of Michael Clarke Duncan's size and build is not going to get too many really good roles and he certainly hasn't played anything remotely like John Coffey again. Parts like that don't come along and the film seems almost to have been built around him. It's one of the most moving performance that has ever been put on film in history. And it's an incredibly difficult role, he's meek for his size and Uncle Tom like, but as we learn far from it. In fact Coffey is beyond what the ordinary human mind can comprehend. Duncan received one of four Academy Award nominations that The Green Mile got, in his case for Best Supporting Actor. Since the film is built around him, my only question is why was it the Supporting Actor category?The Green Mile was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Sound and Best Adapted Screenplay, but did not come home a winner in any of these. A pity that one of the best films of the Nineties could not get at least one Oscar.Where there's a Christ-like figure you also have some devil spawn villains and we have a pair of them in Sam Rockwell as another death row prisoner and David Hutchison as a rat of a prison guard with both connections and issues. What happens to them is both poetic and diabolical in true Stephen King tradition. Others in the cast of note are Bonnie Hunt as Mrs. Hanks, James Cromwell and Patricia Clarkson as the warden and his wife, David Morse and Barry Pepper as two other guards on the block and Michael Jeter as another prisoner with a remarkably trained 'circus' mouse.The Green Mile is a remarkable allegorical picture and might be considered for Easter time viewing if it has a season. It certainly will make folks think."
This is easily one of my favourite movies of all time. do not be put off of watching this movie because of its run time(3 hours) because those 3 hours will just fly by as this movie is so interesting and such a huge success. tom hanks is the main character but i think that Micheal Clarke Duncan really does steal the spotlight away from him. Stephen kings novel (with the same title) is not as good as the movie but it still stands tall i would recommend viewing this little gem if you're a fan of tom hanks or Stephen king.i have never watched a movie that has made me cry but i have to say i was very close to tears after the undeniable ending.the script is just outstanding and the acting is spot on.the storyline is very original as i have never seen anything like this before and i don't think anyone will ever try to copy it.if you're thinking about viewing this title and you haven't seen it already i suggest you get the tissues ready.
"This movie was so well done, always enjoy watching it."
"Tom Hanks, in my opinion, gave the performance of his career by bringing emotion and depth to his part. The only actor that bettered him was Michael Clarke Duncan. How he made this giant like character into a vulnerable pussycat was a marvel. On whole, the cast came together and gave the best performance I have seen in a movie for a long time. Not one of them let the side down by being weak. David Morse who is more known for his supporting roles was also excellent and hopefully not long till he's carrying his own movie. The Green Mile isn't a movie about hope and friendship, as The Shawshank Redemption was, it is a movie about a miracle of a man, and the people he affects."
"Personaly iam that kind of guy who doesn't tear on atouching scene or anything like that,but in this movie i cryied like a baby ,it was a masterpiece,you will never see somthing like this in your life again"
"Great movie. Embodies magic , mystery, love and death in a historical Stephen king fashion. Tom Hanks is brilliant and the movie feels shorter than it is when you watch it"
"Absolutely sensational, a masterpiece on all fronts."
"OMG! This movie has it all. The story, the characters, the setting. It's just such an emotional tear-jerker. I cannot understand how someone can dislike this movie. I can highly recommend this, I can guarantee you this will force you to reflect your own character as well as the choices the movie figures make."
"The Green Mile.... Yet another movie which made me cry.Outstanding work by Frank Darabont. Both his prison dramas ""The Green Mile"" & ""The Shawshank Redemption"" are real class! This film is beautifully written and perfectly cast. Michael Clarke Duncan delivers the performance of his career. There are scenes in this film that will make you quiver, and there are scenes that will keep you on the edge of your seat until you cry. Tom Hanks once again provides a strong support for a talented ensemble cast.Darabont's skills as a screenwriter that even after three hours, he can bring the film to such a good, solid conclusion."
"Until I saw 'the Green Mile', I always thought that the 'Shawshank Redemption' and 'Forrest Gump' were the two saddest movies that I ever saw, but this movie actually blew me away for good.'The Green Mile' tells the tale of a few prison officers whose life changes when a supposed rapist/murderer gets sent to the prison they are in. During this time, they come to realize that he has a mysterious power that can be used for good and that the man may truly be innocent of all accused crimes.I love every single thing about 'the Green Mile', the same way I loved everything about 'The Shawshank Redemption' and 'Forrest Gump'. The acting in the movie was just perfected on all corners. Tom Hanks brilliantly portrays the complex character of Paul Edgecomb and the late Michael Clarke Duncan absolutely steals the show in an Oscar robbed performance as John Coffey. May he ever rest in peace. It wasn't, however, just those two who gave strong performances. The actors playing Brutus, Hal, Del, Percy, Wharton all did an unbelievable job at portraying how realistic prison life may truly be.The story is so emotionally moving that it is impossible to not like and connect with. The characters presented in the movie are some of the finest movie characters that I've ever seen. This film truly mastered characters and what they undergo during prison life.The directing and writing by Frank Darabont, the man behind 'The Shawshank Redemption' absolutely masters everything a film needs to get right once more and adds such layers to each character that we come to truly love by the end of the film.The tone to the movie is so dark that we are immediately thrown into the world presented in this movie. The movie is so sad on many occasions that I was truly left bawling my eyes out.**Spoilers*** The scene where Del is horribly executed to death was just too sad to look at. This movie made me sympathize with criminals more than any other movie.The last half hour made me truly cry all the way through it. The film doesn't attempt to out do itself and just masters it all. The ending to the movie just continued to make me cry.John Coffey's death is perhaps, the saddest death I've ever seen in movie history. It was such a moving scene that truly made me think twice about life.***Spoilers ended*** 'The Green Mile' is a superbly acted, directed, written movie with fascinating characters and a moving story that is sure to make everyone cry and be totally glad that they saw this movie. I however, do not think I will ever sit through this 3 hour movie, as I cannot bear to be emotionally connected to these characters. Watching 'The Green Mile' again and again is not easy, but that's a good thing about the movie."
This is a must see movie for any generation..... phenomenal ❤
Frank Darabont directs another masterpiece adapted by a Steven King novel.Sheer brilliance at its finest.Tom Hanks makes perhaps his greatest performance as the corrections officer Paul Edgecombe who doesn't believe in miracles until he sees one.While Tom and the others all shine in their roles I think that Michael Clarke Duncan deserves most credit as his magnificent portrayal of John Coffey-a convicted 8 foot tall giant murderer.He is accused in the killing of two little girls and sentenced to death.With time however Paul starts to wonder if the gentle hearted Coffey really did commit the murder.The movie has so many emotional moments that it's hard not to sympathize with the characters.The deep emotional drama of some of them is mentally pressuring and you become connected with these people - again expertly accomplished by Darabont who perfectly understands the source material and sticks close to it.Like Shawshank before it the movie teaches us the value of human life and how strong each one of us can be.This is achieved here similarly as again there is an innocent man put in prison but unlike Andy John is touched by God.He is a magical being who calls forth sympathy and by the end the audience is so аttached to him that the somewhat tragic ending is quite sad.As his previous movie Mr Darabont creates yet another fantastic film sure to stay in your heart for a while.Steven King should be proud.
"One of the most moving films ever put on screen is director Frank Darabont's The Green Mile, a deep,tragic, and overall wonderful film that teaches lessons, reaches into your heart, and leaves you taken off your feet, and sad.The Green Mile is told through the eyes of a prison guard named Paul(Tom Hanks) and a year he spent with John Coffey(Michael Clarke Duncan), a death row inmate who has miraculous powers. As the film goes on, you get to know Coffey, and you love him, though, he's impossible to hate.The Green Mile is one of the most heart wrenching films I have ever seen. Aside from its wonderful story, there are characters here that you grow to love, such as Paul and John, but yet there are characters that you really grow to hate, and that brings me to the unbelievably fantastic performances.Aside from Duncan's marvelous Coffey, the best performance here is from Doug Hutchinson as Percy, the films most hatable character. He's not the bad guy, but if you've seen this guy you wouldn't be surprised if he was. Percy is an arrogant doushbag, and you really can't stand him. I hated him more than the film's actual villain(not going to reveal).In 3 hours, Darabont focuses on the characters and the story lines, which I admire. These are some of the best 3 hours I have ever spent. And even though The Green Mile ends on such a sad note, I have to say that I preferred it over The Shawshank Redemption. Sue me, I don't care.A"
MCD was an amazing actor. Seriously could not believe my eyes when I watched this film. One of my all-time favorites. It will have you in tears I'm sure! And Tom Hanks is good as always in what was a very sensitive role.
"It's beautiful, I find it really hard to keep focus in movies but this i couldn't stop watching. I love it."
"This movie is very moving. Great storyline, and extremely captivating. It definitely captures the emotions of the viewer."
Such an old iconic film - another Tom Hanks great. Michael C-D was an amazing actor who will be missed but his job in this film was nothing short of tear-jerking. Watch it!
"There have been a few times in my life when a film moved me to such a degree that I cry for hours after the end credits have rolled... last night was one of them. I avoided watching The Green Mile for years after my very first experience left me crying for a whole week and experiencing intense nightmares about it. One could say that I was probably not emotionally ready to handle a movie of this magnitude and while the emotions I experienced were very real to me, I never grasped the underlying messages and couldn't understand the symbolism.As a matured adult I experienced the film very differently. On the surface level, this film is about the brutal murder of two young girls which led a black man to be falsely accused of the crime and sentenced to death. The film delves into the relationships formed between the prisoners and the officers in charge, and the realization that he may be innocent of the crime. However, beneath the surface, the film is riddled with deep symbolism that makes it incredibly difficult to watch.The selection of cast members for this movie was expertly chosen - each one bringing a new layer of humanity to the overall story. Tom Hanks was breath-taking in his portrayal of Paul Edgecomb, the head guard on the mile who was greatly affected by the magical presence of John Coffey. Tom captured Paul's inner struggles beautifully and brought the character to life. The late Michael Clarke Duncan, who played John Coffey was mesmerising and I could not take my eyes off of him. His muscular physique and rough exterior made him perfect for the role but it was his ability to embody the mysterious and often naive nature of John Coffey's character that should have won him an Oscar. His character's growth throughout the film and his ultimate realisation that the only way to escape this unpleasant life is to go through with his execution are what made him so heart-wrenching to watch. Moreover, the underlying symbolism in this movie was expertly hidden and handled with care. Most notably was Mr Jingles, the little grey mouse who befriended inmate Edward Delacroix and offered him some relief from the pain he was facing as his impending execution was fast approaching, symbolising the child-like nature of the human spirit and our longing to cling to life. I found their interactions very heart-warming but it was his brutal execution that awoke a sense of hopelessness and sadness in me.Another example of this was evident in the scene where John Coffey is being led out of the prison to be taken to the house of the Sheriff who's wife was dying of brain cancer; he stops for a moment to look up at the stars and tries to share a story with the officers. Later, as he is being led to a wooded area outside the prison walls, he stops for a moment to smell the leaves on the floor and then offers them to the officers to smell. In both scenes, he portrays both the child-like wonder so many of us have lost and the lack of gratitude that we have for simple things like being able to smell leaves or look up at the stars. Finally, John Coffey epitomized three of the most beautiful characteristics any person could have: love, compassion and empathy. As I watched his character unfold, I felt drawn to the pain that he was experiencing. If I had to describe my own experience with this life, it would be through John Coffey's famous line: ""I'm tired, boss. Tired of being on the road, lonely as a sparrow in the rain. I'm tired of never having a buddy to be with, to tell me where we's going to, coming from or why. Mostly, I'm tired of people being ugly to each other."""
"First off, the reason I watched this movie is Michael Clarke Duncan. Almost an year back I read a post in IMDb saying ""The Green Mile actor Michael Clarke Duncan is dead at 54"". I wondered why IMDb mentioned a movie name at a person's death post. I don't know about this movie until his death. So I really wanted to watch this for him. It took almost an year for me to get this movie. As of movie, actually I lost myself in that movie for like 3 hours. I never knew how to characterize acting until watching this. I mean I didn't think I was watching a movie, actually I felt like it was so real. Tom Hanks played an exquisite role, I personally think if anyone wants to see what acting is, the search ends here. About Michael Clarke Duncan:- His role actually overshadowed everything in this movie. Who would have imagined a man with this physical structure would play a character like this.. This man made me wept at the end.. It's hard to believe he died. May his soul Rest in Peace... Dedicate this review to Michael Clarke Duncan"
"Truly a wonderful picture. I agree with what most people on here are saying: this film, along with Shawshank define great American cinema. Both pictures are ingenious in their conception -kudos to master writer Stephen King - and really spark more than just entertainment. This is not ars gratia artis, art for arts sake; it's art for the sake of humanity; for portraying brilliant stories that center around human interactions in the most inhuman of places. If anyone stumbles on this review, understand that there are few similarly heart-wrenching films out there. Others have pointed out more, and I agree. But these stand out among the rest, and that is indisputable.If you are a film enthusiast that has not seen these films, or if you are just looking for a great flick, look no further. Definitely rent or buy these films for they are pearls of American cinema.Enjoy!"
"It is difficult sometimes to watch long movies, because just a few of them are so tense to rivet you to television for more then two hours, but this one really does, it shows you the way how to understand the people around you! It is story about human character,their life and believing...It shows how we react on things that just happen without reason, things that we can't explain even if we see it by our own eyes. It is true like movie tells us- it is difficult to find miracle or better that miracle find us, but if we do, we don't believe in it or worse we destroy(kill) it! Great act by Tom Hanks like always, role of a good family person, who help those around him, person who stands up for his convictions, is written all over his skin, actually whole crew that cared about prison was picked up very carefully and they really made a great entirety...great story by Mr. King...maybe a little unusual for his writing, but one more reason to congratulate him for this one! We all walk down the (our) green mile, but it seems too long sometimes...I hope they both will have a very long walk and let us to enjoy in their writing and acting! Really great movie!"
"A great cast with great performances and a great story that keeps you hooked all the time and moves you more than once.I would like to begin this review by stating that I've never read the novel written by Stephen King. So I don't know anything about the similarities or differences between this movie and the novel.There are many things about this movie that I like a lot. One of those things is the cast, which is a very strong one. Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan, David Morse, Barry Pepper, ... All of them have a role that seems to be written especially for them. It's good to see David Morse again, he's one of those actors you commonly see, but never in a leading role. Doug Hutchinson's character is one of the most annoying I've ever seen. But perhaps that's a good thing. He really was great at being annoying. LOL :DAnother thing about this movie which I like a lot is the story which keeps you hooked for the majority of its length. There are many movies out there that have a storyline that are shorter in length that have you glancing at the clock from time to time wondering when the movie will finally end. The Green Mile however, keeps you hooked and makes you curious about what will happen next and further. With a little over 3 hours, this movie only seems too long but doesn't feel that way unlike many others. At least, not when you're into this genre of movies.This story nearly has it all: it has excitement, drama, love, comedy. One moment you're laughing, the other moment you're feeling compassion with people that are being sent to death. As said, this movie is not about the deathrow, but about the people on it and about the spirituality, mystery and how everything affects the characters that spend their final hours their or work there for a living./*** BEGIN SPOILER ALERT ***\ One of the best moments was the final moment with Michael Clarke Duncan on the chair. The sadness you could read from the faces of the guards (Tom Hanks, David Morse, Barry Pepper)... Perhaps it's not correct for them to be like that, but at the same time it is very moving and understanding.\*** END SPOILER ALLERT ***/ ALl in all, it's a very enjoyable film with a deep story that really takes you along. Within 3 hours I feel like I've witnessed their lives for months. At the end of the movie, when you start looking back at the beginning, you'll probably understand. :) Some characters probably weren't explored that much, but probably with good reason. After all, its a movie about magic, miracles, spirituality. And the persons involved with that have to be mysterious in some ways.This is probably one of the best films I've ever seen. My rating for it: 4 1/2 out of 5."
"Now a resident in a rest home, one time head warden on death row, Paul Edgecomb, is struggling with his untold memories.  When a film brings it all back to him he recounts the story of the time when a huge black prisoner called John Coffey was put into wing.  It is not too long before the peaceful, loving prisoner, found guilty of the rape and murder of two children, has mysterious gifts that transcend the decay of the lives around the prison.After Shawskank Redemption I was attracted to this as many of the makers were the same not to mention the author, the prison setting and the running time.  However that same running time and some negative reviews put me off and I didn't get round to seeing it till recently.  The film is very slow and this is occasionally to it's detriment but not too often.  It's main failing is that it's supernatural spin makes it difficult to get involved and lose yourself in completely.  `Redemption's ` strength was that it was a human story.  Green Mile tries to have the strength of human spirit at it's core but it doesn't quite come off.That's not to say that the story still isn't moving and involving because it is.  However it doesn't come as easily as it should and when the story slows a little bit it does feel slow.  It could easily have lost 30 minutes as at it's current  length it feels like a long movie which is a bad thing  Two Towers is long but didn't FEEL long!  Also something I always find annoying is when a score really works the emotion where the actual film can't manage it by itself  here the score is working overtime to wring every drop of emotion from the scenes.The film is very well directed and there are powerful moments of cruelty. When the chair is used I couldn't help but feel that it was real.  However the main attraction (other than the mouse!) is a wonderful performance by Duncan.  True there is an element of slave cliché about it but he rises above that a gives a performance of such emotion and such gentleness that came as a surprise from someone of his build.  Hanks is also good and wisely plays it quite low-key and the support cast is solid, comprised of many many well known faces including Morse and Cromwell.Overall this is good but overlong.  It is a very different film from Shawshank and many will compare it to that much better film.  However the film is worth the work despite some simplistic errors and flaws."
"This was such an intense movie that, at three hours in length, I didn't really wind up watching this as many times as I thought I would. This was another of those films I rated very high on the first viewing but lower and lower on the second and third looks, finally eliminating it from my collection. However, that first look was a memorable one because this film had some dramatic moments!The acting in here is outstanding and runs the gamut from well-known actors like Tom Hanks to several unknowns, all having major roles. It's also nicely filmed. However, the story and the acting are the main attractions. The unique story gets you involved to the point where, even having to watch several very, very unpleasant scenes, you don't want to put the movie down.Big Michael Clarke Duncan elevated his career a lot with this role, playing ""John Coffey,"" a prisoner with strange powers. You could root for all the characters save two, a sadistic guard aptly named ""Brutus 'Brutal' Howell"" (David Morse) and Warden Hal Moores (James Cromwell). I was sorry to hear Cromwell blaspheme regularly but not surprised since he seems to have played so many ""bad guy"" roles in the past dozen years and done this in other films. With those two exceptions, however, it was nice to finally see prison guards as good guys, something rarely seen since the classic-movie era. Michael Jeter, one of those unknown actors, was a lot of fun to watch as ""Eduard Delacroix.""Overall, however, as much as I praise this movie, the unpleasant scenes, the high use of the Lord's name in vain and the length of it all make this a tough movie to watch over and over, but it's a movie to definitely see at least once. Let's put it this way: it gets your attention!"
"""The Green Mile"" expertly mixes film genres: It's part prison flick, part supernatural mystery and part drama. It was adapted from Stephen King's novel by director/writer Frank Darabont and released in 1999. If you're not an admirer of Stephen King books/films (I'm not) DON'T let that deter you from viewing this beautiful and spiritually-profound film; ""The Green Mile"" is by no means a typical horror story, although it does have a couple of horrific scenes.THE STORY: Tom Hanks plays the head Death Row guard at a Tennessee prison during the Depression. A new inmate is introduced, a hulking black man named John Coffey (exquisitely played by Michael Clarke Duncan), who is condemned to death for the rape and murder of two little girls. Hanks and his guard friends slowly become intrigued by the seemingly pure-hearted giant and begin to realize that he is eminently gifted in a decidedly supernatural way; they conclude that there's no way he could be guilty of the crime. If that's the case, who is guilty? And will the guilty party get away with it.""The Green Mile"" is a 3-hour film, way over my limited attention span, and yet it is somehow utterly engrossing, even on repeat viewings. The film is character/dialogue driven, unique and wholly unpredictable. Please don't mistake this for a run-of-the-mill prison flick. The fact that it largely takes place in a prison in the 1930s is a secondary issue. This is an incredibly powerful supernatural mystery/drama.*** SPOILER ALERT *** (Don't read this next paragraph unless you want to consider possibilities about the character John Coffey) John Coffey's last name is, evidently, derived from an ancient Sumerian word, kophi, which means ""winged creature."" Hence, John could be viewed as a angel or messenger from the Almighty. In truth, John is an obvious type of Jesus Christ verified in six ways: (1.) His initials are J.C. (2.) He's completely pure/good-hearted and can easily recognize true evil. (3.) He miraculously heals people. (4.) He pronounces and executes divine judgment. (5.) He is sacrificed even though completely innocent. And (6.) He offers eternal life (in a sense), as evidenced by the extended life-span of the Hanks character and the mouse ""Mr. Jingles."" *** End SPOILER ALERT *** BOTTOM LINE: Make no mistake, ""The Green Mile"" is one of the greatest films ever made. It ranks up there with my 5 or 10 best. Don't miss out on this cinematic masterpiece. Now please excuse me while I wipe the tears from my face."
"I think I got the message of the film after about 45 minutes; that there is so much hatred and anger among people, and that revenge is nothing constructive. A very important message which I think the film delivers brilliantly, with John Coffey as a ""triumphant card"". The supernatural effects in the movie might be unbelievable if you focus solely on them, but I think they're ""metaphoring"" and make things a bit more understandable, maybe. A wonderful movie that moves at a measured pace on to a very unexpected ending. As with most great movies the casting is almost perfect and each character gives added depth to a rich script. Tom Hanks gives another outstanding performance, his supporting actors (particularly David Morse)actually support and enhance his role. A really great story - not at all what I expected, but much more."
"Frank Darabont, the extraordinary director of the hit ""Shawshank Redemption"", comes back to the big screen with yet another adaptation of another prison drama novel by Stephen King. This time, the story is ""The Green Mile"", and this time he has the help of Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan joining a powerful cast that also includes Bonnie Hunt, Michael Jeter, and Sam Rockwell. The movie stars Hanks as Paul Edgecomb, an officer on death row, with a serious bladder infection, who rounds up a new suspect named John Coffey, portrayed by Michael Clarke Duncan, a man with mysterious immortality powers, that may have been accused for the raping and killing of two innocent girls. The movie follows as a dramatic and entertaining tale of hope, faith, and courage. Darabont brings back the lucky charm used in ""Shawshank"", but this time he combines real life with fantasy, and creates a story of miracles and dreams. Anyways, the film has powerful backgrounds, and the film focuses on the story with lots of drama and thrills, and the script is more well-written since Shawshank was well-written. The special effects are amazingly realistic, and the story is like a special charm from the heart. I really enjoyed this film, and it's fun to watch it again and again. You will enjoy it so much, you will start to wonder where the 3-hour running time has gone. ""The Green Mile"", in my review, ""an exhilarating prison drama, truly watchable""."
"I love this movie, and I have seen it a couple times. It doesn't matter that I know what is going to happen or that I know the movie like the back of my hand, I cry endlessly every single time. I watched it again last night. My boyfriend and I bought it, and he had never seen it. So we sat down to watch the movie, and I realized how truly emotionally moving this movie is.IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE ENTIRETY OF THE MOVIE DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER DOWN...The characters in this movie really hit home. You fall in love with these men that are on death row..(all except for ""Wild Bill""). You don't know what on earth they have done, yet it is so bad that they are on death row, and you fall in love with them. You can't help it. I sat there last night, propped up on my pillow in the bed and watched and fell in love with this huge beast of a man that is convicted of raping and murdering two girls. (I knew from the get-go that he didn't do it). And I watched and fell in love with Dale, a French, homosexual, crazy, mouse-loving man. I watched him fall in love with Mr. Jingles. I grew into this hate for Percy ""WET""more (I still get a kick out of that name). And when it came time for Dale to be executed, I cried like I was losing a family member. It was so hard to watch this happen! My boyfriend had to pause the movie, just to check on me. I sat there for five minutes, crying so hard. Then the same thing for John Coffey, I couldn't even watch him be persecuted. I sat beside my boyfriend, face buried in his chest weeping every tear out of me. It was so awful. I have NEVER in my life had a movie effect me like the way this one does. It is a brilliant movie, and the characters chosen for each role could not have been better portrayed if this was a true story, with the real-life people playing their own parts. Tom Hanks is a wonderful actor, and personally I think he does his best when he is acting as a southern authority figure. He is such a convincing actor, along with everyone else in this movie. Props to the actors, director, and Stephen King, you all are wonderful!"
"I really wanted to like this film, I really tried to. But in the end I heavily regretted having seen it and personally I think of ""The Green Mile"" as the first appalling film of this year. This saddens me the more as the director of that film is Frank Darabont who brought us the wonderful ""Shawshank Redemption"". The parallels to his debut from 1994 are obvious: a prison story full of optimism(a friendship between the two main protagonists (one black, one white)) written by the same author (King) and again overlength (this time you've even got a running time of 3 hours+).I would argue that already the story itself is problematic in its conception: the characterisation is implausible. The prisoners (with the exception of one) are all portrayed as good natured men who obviously could do no harm to other people. It makes the fact that they've been sentenced to death for heinous crimes the more unlikely. For a grim and dark place like a prison the green mile is a unusual harmonistic place.This depiction of a prison and the characters is not just naive and almost laughable, it also reminded me of how more realistic and appropriate in such terms ""Shawshank Redemption"" was. People could say that the film generally is not very realistic since John Coffey has supernatural powers but I honestly think that capital punishment is a too serious subject to treat it as an element of a fairy tale. Moreover the film never questions the death penalty, the message rather seems to be that death row is a necessity. Again I was reminded of an another film, Tim Robbins' ""Dead Man Walking"", arguably one of the best and most important american films of the last decade(if you want to see an appropriate and artistic convincing account of the death row, then you're in for a treat).There's basically nothing to say against an optimistic approach when you're talking about such a sad, disturbing and important issue, but what made me really upset about ""The Green Mile"" is the unbearable extent of sentimentality and naivety in the film. Sure, ""Shawshank Redemption"" was emotional, too; but there it felt right, there Darabont managed to find the right tone - here it is just pure kitsch. When Coffey says towards the end something along the lines that people shouldn't treat each other badly and that he wants a peaceful world, I almost started to giggle. Moreover the contrast between the harmonistic, light- hearted scenes with the mouse and the execution scenes doesn't work at all, it destroys the film. Moreover these three scenes (particularly Percys revenge on Delacroix) are not just disgusting(and believe me, I can really bear a lot),they perfectly fit into this unpleasant mixture of feel good- mentality and pathos. There were good performances in the film (Doug Hutchinson, the ""Polaroid Man"" from Chris Carters ""Millennium"", Michael Duncan Clarke, who made the best out of his cliche role), but in the end I didn't care about the one or two good things I could say about this film. And Tom Hanks? Well, Hanks should really try something new-he's played the clean, good-natured guy so often, that it starts to get on my nerves and not just on mine.I just can't put into words, how much better, how superior ""Shawshank"" was than ""The Green Mile"". The difference is not just striking, it really hurts. When I was watching ""The Green Mile"" I heard people in the audience crying - I was tempted too, but not because I was moved, no, in my case it would have been out of sheer disgust. What a missed opportunity..."
"This is the worst film i've seen all year, in fact I thought it was aimed at children.  How anyone can call this a piece of uplifting cinema is beyond me.  Okay, Tom Hanks gives a pretty good performance for a one-dimensional do-gooder, but the rest of the film is pantomime of the cheesiest kind, Puss-in-Boots at my local theatre was less predictable. The characters are cliched stereotypes bar none.  We have good kindly guy, comedy good guy, insane bad guy, nice but dim black guy (particularly offensive for this millennium) which leads us to a tedious sermon on good v evil of the most simplistic sort .  The director is clearly living off his reputation, having directed the excellent 'SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION' and poor old Stephen King must be turning in his bed (hopefully he's recovered now). The best thing about the film is Mr Jangles the comedy reincarnating mouse who makes a glorious reappearance in the final reel with slightly longer fur.  The death of Mr Jangles earlier on in the proceedings probably arouses more sympathy from sentimental American audiences than the sight of nasty prisoners frying in 'Old Sparky'.  Please go and watch 'Midnight Express' instead for a slightly more realistic representation of prison life. Risible."
"If you go to see ""The Green Mile,"" be prepared to laugh. A lot. And not because the film's intention is for the audience to laugh--it's just that bad. It has all the outward appearances of a very moving, emotionally charged film that will make you leave the theater saying ""Wow."" (The subject concerns Death Row inmates, Tom Hanks stars, and the director is of ""The Shawshank Redemption"" fame). But I just left the theater laughing, because the movie had become so predictable in its plot and dialogue that the woman behind me had begun to recite the lines along with the characters. (And the sad thing about THAT is that I saw it on opening night).But its predictability is not even remotely one of ""The Green Mile""'s major problems, and those are an overly corny, hokey story and script that are nearly impossible to buy (especially those particles that fly out of John Cofee's mouth whenever he performs a miracle--what is THAT?), acting ranging from mediocre to downright bad (no wonder John Cofee was given so few lines), and a complete inconsistency in tone. A movie about Death Row inmates should NOT cut from a scene of a man being executed (of which this movie shows about three) to a scene of the guards cooing over a cute little mouse (which appeared in the movie so much that the damn thing should've been named after the mouse). The execution scenes are of such a brutal nature that directly juxtaposing them with light-hearted prison follies completely degrades the seriousness of execution and is outright jolting for the audience.""The Green Mile"" left a bad taste in my mouth from its opening moments which never really left. Once I began to get a feel for how limited it was in hitting the real issue of the film, however, I was able to view it as one of those happy ""drama-turned-comedy"" accidents. I can only say that any recognition for ""The Green Mile"" for any more than it actually is--a piece of cheese that never deserved to see cinematic daylight--is  a not-so-happy accident indeed."
"This must have been the worst movie I have seen in a long time! As I sat in the movie theater watching the people around me starting to sob I really wondered if everybody had gone insane. First of all, I really didn't like how this movie dealt with the topic capital punishment. I hardly doubt the atmosphere in a death tract depicted in ""The Green Mile"" is anything like that in real life. Guards and inmates are buddies? (Except for the one BAD guard and the one BAD inmate, of course!) They're cracking jokes and having fun with a little mouse? Oh please! I had a feeling this movie was bad when it started in that nursing home with that sentimental looking old guy but when John started to cough up that what-ever-it-was-horrible-computer-animation-stuff I knew it was just terrible. The movie is overly sentimental, has a horrible constructed plot (sure, the real killer just happens to be in the cell across to Johns) and lacks any creativity and imagination. I read somewhere that Michael Duncan did a great job in this movie. But frankly all he did was cry and sweat and supporting the horrible stereo type of infantile, good, maybe innocently wise but not very clever blacks."
"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I really don't understand how anyone with a critical sense can like such a film. I mean, I'm not a cynical person, but I truly can't stand 100%-righteous characters such as Coffey, Hedgecomb and all the other nice death row wardens. I'm not a 5-year-old kid and I can't watch The Green Mile without being sarcastic. How can any spectator accept the way this tall black guy is playing? And what did Frank Darabont expect spectators to react watching his so unfair and unhappy fate? Did he want us to burst into tears? Come on! The Shawshank Redemption was shot a few years ago by the same director. It was a prison movie like this one but it was a good one for it avoided too many melodramatic effects and because the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were above all human characters. Those played by Tom Hanks and every other cast member aren't humans. They are nothing but all-American icons and I hate that. Besides the death penalty issue is the heart of the film. Does Darabont seriously tackle it? Never! In The Green Mile, being legally executed appears to be something which has to be taken for granted by every citizen, no matter if people die in some awful way (i.e. Eugène Delacroix, the guy with the lovely mouse), and no matter if an innocent guy sometimes gets toasted. At the end of the film, old Hedgecomb confesses that he couldn't stand executions anymore after Coffey died. So what did he decide to do? Did he organize public protests and demonstrations against this punishment? No! He just left the penitentiary and found another job. What a hero! What an activist! Sorry, everyone, but all this really sucks."
"When I watch films like the Green Mile I feel absolutely furious. Mainstream US cinema industry has unfortunately bombarded us with products (I cannot treat them as artworks) of very low quality, to be consumed immediately and provide some instant but short-lived gratification of the senses. Such films trigger shallow reactions of fear, sadness, sympathy etc., but never stick to mind and will never become points to which one would return at leisure to ponder or draw meaning for one's own purposes. Extraordinary and unrealistic situations, special effects, obsession with violence and cruelty, cheap morality and ostensible moral struggle and (on other occasions) sex are the ingredients of 95 per cent of such products. I am deeply sorry that these so-called artists seek to maximise profits at the expense of their art and I hope that they sometime wake up, if they ever can, to complex social realities and relations and to the multiplicity of the human condition, which they so obviously ignore and downgrade."
"Nice packaging, but too much of it. Typical Stephen King story, well-told but not much weight.  Full of stereotypes and predictable good guy/bad guy stuff.  I loved Tom Hanks in ""Philadelphia"" -- that was a challenging role and he performed it magnificently, with depth of character, pathos but no sentimentality.  Ever since, though, he's taken on one interchangeable role after another. Enough, already. The sad thing is that I truly CAN believe that almost 50% of the IMDB voters so far rate this very average and over-long film as a ""10"".  Excellence apparently is a function of the volume of tears they make you shed.  I say, ""make you"", because I think this film fully intends to manipulate emotions -- the emotions of white, comfortable, middle class Americans who enjoy cheering for the oppressed, simple but pure of heart big black man who is abused by Southern crackers.  Aren't we glad we're not like that? Yet again, a black man gets to be a parody, not a person.  We white folks don't have to be afraid just because he's big and black, see, 'cause he's really a Jesus figure (""J. C."", his initials).  What a relief. Still wouldn't want him living next door, though, would we? All in all, good actors playing two dimensional roles. In the real world, as Kosovo and Northern Ireland and Rwanda show, we're all just a hair-trigger away from being cruel.  Let's have more films that recognize that there are few good guys and bad guys, just a whole lot of us doing the best we can and trying to do it right.  That's too complicated for most Hollywood types, and doesn't usually make much money. ""Dead Man Walking"" was ten times the film that this one was, and even it wasn't a ""10"".""Besieged"" and ""The Informer"" were so much better than ""The Green Mile"" that to mention Oscars without naming those films is ridiculous.And that's all this middle-aged long-time and ardent lover of films has to say."
"Tom Hanks seems to be obsessed with starring in movies that go for ridiculous lengths of time. Once again I was bored out of my brains watching Hanksy (who can act) work with nothing for 188 minutes. So much boredom, so much of my time wasted.I don't mind a magical story as long as the characters who are portrayed as normal humans react in such a manner. None of these characters did react realistically which quickly turned the movie into not only a raving bore, but an absolute farce as well.I didn't altogether hate this movie, even though it was awful. If the small potential it possessed was condensed into a two hour flick then it may have kept me from yawning for 188 ridiculously long minutes."
"Hard to believe that so many people seem to believe that this cheesy movie is a masterpiece or even the best film they've ever seen. I borrowed the DVD recently and I seriously can't remember having seen a worse picture from beginning to end in quite some time. Everything about it is phony, predictable, stereotyped and contrived.A corny pseudo-moral tale that can be embraced by everyone who enjoys being manipulated in the crudest way. To go into details about all the flaws this movie has to offer is not worth the time, I already wasted more than three hours watching it. If you like to entertain yourself with a film worth watching, pick up something else."
"***** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ****** Aw come on guys how can anyone vote this film into the IMDB top 250 ? First of all it features the most unconvincing prison officers in the history of cinema who are wetter than drowned fish , there`s no way these guys would get jobs as bleeding heart social workers never mind become guards on death row . Secondly this film is just so predictable ( Which is why I warned of possible spoilers ) there`s no way the audience can be taken in that John Coffey is guilty of murdering a child , and likewise you just know that Percy ain`t gonna enjoy his pension . Thirdly am I alone in thinking Percy didn`t deserve his fate ? He`s surrounded by murdering scum so what do I care if he breaks inmates fingers and lets them suffer in the chair . At least Percy acts in a believable way and consistent manner unlike his colleagues Fourthly this film lasts more than 3 hours and there`s hardly any plot twists that saved THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION from accusations of being overlong All in all a very overrated overlong film based on a very weak Stephen King story . The fact that King`s original novellas were marketed through a gimmick says a lot about the uninteresting story . Is it any surprise that no one wants to adapt King novels for the big screen these days ?"
"I can't believe that an actor with the credentials Tom Hanks would star in this film.  It was so slow, my family & I were praying for it to end.  The plot didn't go anywhere, and the ending was so weak I threw my hands in the air and just asked, ""why?""  How could they drag the movie out that long for such a stock plot and predictable ending?  And the execution scenes seemed to be there for shock value only, and were quite gruesome and gratuitous.I like Tom Hanks, but I refuse to like a movie he stars in simply for reason that he is in it.  There has to be a plot, and The Green Mile came up short. I do not recommend this movie to anyone, in fact I rate it as one of the worst (and overrated) big budget films of 1999 (and probably this decade)."
"There are some times when I can say that I must have seen a truly different film than the vast majority of other people in the world. This time is one of them. For this film to be rated so highly, is completely bewildering to me. Let me just say that I am by no means some kind of American working class slob who can only sit through a 90 minute action-packed popcorn film loaded special fx and t&a. I can easily sit through films like Barry Lyndon and 2001 without even getting up for a snack. If a film is truly great, it will hold my attention. If it isn't, then I may just doze off. At least I was interested enough to rewind it when I woke up to see what I missed. It wasn't worth the effort. This film failed on almost every level to connect or convey any true emotion to me. The only character I liked was Michael Clarke Duncan as a Christ-like figure who has exceptional healing powers, but is put to death for a crime he didn't commit. The film is slow, talky, and not very well-acted. This was truly surprising since the cast members of this film are usually quite good.Tom Hanks stars as a guard in charge of the death row wing of on old southern prison. Through most of the film, we see him and the other guards interacting with the prisoners and carrying out an execution here and there. Tom Hanks gives one of the worst performances I've ever seen him give. The only emotion he shows at all is agony while trying to pass a stone through his urethra! Yes, a major plot point in this film is that Hanks is having trouble urinating! Whatever.As far as the other characters go, nobody does that well in the acting department. David Morse, Barry Pepper, and James Cromwell have boring characters. The individuals who play the bad guard and the psychotic prisoner over-act badly. Michael Jeter's character is so annoying that I couldn't wait to see him executed. His execution scene is perhaps the most memorable scene in the film. And the part with the little mouse! Way too cutesy for words. I thought I was watching Stuart Little for a moment. And not to spoil the conclusion or anything, but there is absolutely no payoff for anything we've learned throughout the film. I at least was hoping the ending would tie everything up in a thoughtful manner that would somehow make the whole experience rewarding. Nope! Overall, this film is a dud. I really can't see where all the hype came from. Do yourself a favor and stick with Shawshank instead. That's one hell of a lot better film. 4 of 10 starsSo sayeth the Hound."
"Never have I been this angry with a movie. Never, and except for 'The 51st State' this is by far the worst I've ever seen. Of course, you can't question or criticize the standard of this production - it's definitely an a-movie if you were to look at the amount of money put into it, but that's really not the point. It wouldn't be the first time a studio put a couple of millions too many into an easily sold, and too easily chewed, heart breaking story.And yeah, the story is so hilarious, I'm not going to comment on it much further, but it contains ""the narrator"", ""the hero"", ""the one that brings the story forward"", ""the good"", ""the bad"", ""the funny"" and ""the unbeliever that becomes a believer"". Nothing new beneath the sun, only poorly executed re-runs of ideals belonging in the 19th century. When it finally reaches the not very surprising end, we are supposed to be crying our guts out. If we are, we have been had by the studio, falling for all the oldest tricks in the book.'The Green Mile' is in short one of those films that are glowing in their very contempt and low thoughts of the viewer. Every clishé, and no artistic thought, has been put into it. It really is as if Darabont is mocking us with it. Doesn't he think more of us than an ignorant, easily entertained, and easily moved, mob? Is he kidding?The only thing I can say that is at least a bit positive about 'The Green Mile' is Graham Greene. Had it not been for him, my 2 would have been a 1."
"The Green Mile is a masterwork. This is film as art, at it's very best. The depth of the cast is extraordinary, with all of the players delivering excellent performances. There is a clear sense here that all involved in the production knew that this was something special, and gave it their all. See this film if you truly enjoy actors giving everything to their craft. Watch for the countless subtleties of expression, and the great power that the cast creates with silence. This is evident in the opening sequence and remains throughout. Above all, Michael Duncan as John Coffey is exceptional. He brings gripping emotion to a unique, fascinating character.The Green Mile should bring you joy, laughter, and if you are like most in the theater this night, tears."
"I promise you that if you have any humanity in your soul, by the end of watching this movie. You will find yourself weeping, because how moving this movie is. The Green Mile is an amazing movie directed by Frank Darabont who knows a little bit about directing prison movies. His biggest claim to fame was 1994's Shawshank Redemption, a prison movie adapted from a Stephen King novel. So it was no surprise that Frank and Stephen King would once again team up to bring audiences another great movie. Can lightning strike in the same place twice? Yes! Set in the Deep South rather than the north this time, Green Mile takes place in Louisiana's prison during the Great Depression. The film really captured the era. Tom Hanks plays Paul Edgecombe, a prison guard that works at a quarter of the prison whom job is to execute the inmates. The job is hard and tough. He became to question himself, and his job when a new inmate came named John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), a simple minded giant whom works more like a miracle worker than a murderer. I have to say what a great cast! Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey was amazing. The way he can pull the audience in, with his delivery is just spell bounding. I got his 'broken glasses' and 'he kill them with they love' speech. I think this encompasses a major theme, how people are ugly and cruel to each other, and justice is only sometimes given. Everything about him, speaks John Coffey from the way he handle miracles, and even the child like innocents when playing with a pet mouse name Mr. Jingles. David Morse as Brutus ""Brutal"" Howell is a great supporting character that helps Paul with his job. I really liked his performance as the strong- will, second in command officer. Then there is Dough Hutchison as Percy Whetmore - he plays a great weasel. He captured Percy's cowardice, arrogance, and violence perfectly as the crudest of the guards. Last, worth noting is Sam Rockwell. He was a little older than how I imagined the criminal Wild Bill to be. He did bring some good humor to the film. I do find the moon pie scene hilarious. A lot of critics have panned the film for not having realistic characters. The characterizations on the death row inmates don't really seems like they belong there. Honestly, does anybody think Eduard Delacroix (Michael Jeter) even commit a crime? He seems way too old to be really a murderer, even Arlan Bitterbuck (Graham Greene) didn't seem so bad. Then you got Percy, the immature sadistic, racist, creep, painted here as being nothing less than 100% evil. Not 50% evil, not 80% evil. But 100% evil. Is that realistic? Is it? Does this guy have even a single redeeming feature? Nope, not one. So I'm not buying this guy either. The characters were way too good or just plan evil with little to no character development. I think it's OK to have film like that, and how the characters were portrayed, I think it was very accurate to the book. In the book, I had a hard time telling the other guards Harry (Jeffery DeMunn) and Dean (Barry Pepper) apart, so I'm glad in the movie, Dean was considerably older than Harry. The biggest change from the book is the racism in the South. I honestly think they toned it down in the movie, the n-word is used plenty of times in the book. Another thing that the movie didn't put was the short story about old Paul in Georgia Pines with a cruel employee that reminded him of Percy. Adding this to the movie would have made it too long, it was already three hours, but it definitely gave his elderly age some more depth. The movie did add some new things to help the film. I think the repeated visual of the light bulbs bursting during Coffey's bursts of power added to the story since we couldn't get inside of Paul's head. I also thought Coffey showing Paul what he saw as opposed to Paul going to investigate was a good move for the film - it shortened the film that was needed badly. Another thing that angry some critics, was the ""Christ"" like symbolism with John Coffey. People says it was too much messianic overtones in the story but it's absolutely ludicrous. As a Christian man, I wasn't offended by it. People need to be open to all beliefs to get this film. Once you get pass that, you find John Coffey to be a very interesting lovable guy, and you get emotional invested in him to the point that you cry when you see what happen in the end with his character. Then there are those people that mad because the movie is way too long. Not that that is always bad, but it didn't help things at all here. If this movie had been the standard flick, but I will defend this movie because the Green Mile is supposed to seem too long. It was even quote in the film. Anybody who read the book, should have known that. The music by Thomas Newman is amazing. It fits in with the mood of the film. Even the song from 1935's Top Hat work in this film. Overall: I really enjoyed this movie. I can understand why it was nominated for a Best Picture at the Academy Awards. An amazing story. Sad emotional for sure, but a lot of great stories are. BTW- RIP Michael Clarke Duncan. You were a great actor."
"I believe I'm one of the few human beings that had no idea of what is movie was about. I heard a lot about this picture, of course, but I didn't even know what the main story was. Maybe it's a plus, since it allowed me to see the entire thing without knowing what was gonna happen next. Well, like other death row movies, this one really touched me; ending with people lives, despite what they've done, is a sad subject for me. It must be the most terrifying feeling to know you're going to be killed in a matter of minutes. Preparing yourself for the electric chair might be even worse. As a thrilling Stephen King's story, ""The Green Mile"" brings an innovation-- this time, a character has a special gift of healing people, like a saint. It is indeed beautiful to see that big and apparently bad guy helping people as he can. Filmmakers are mean in this case-- they make you adore the character, just to kill him in the end and let you down. It happened to me as well, I cried in the end and it is not a common thing for me-- so by that you can imagine how strong this movie is. A masterpiece in matter of acting, story and life."
"The Green Mile is my favorite movie! It was a complete roller coaster ride of emotions that made me cry. The end was the saddest when Michael Clarke Duncan's character is put on the chair although we know he is innocent and it was the crazy man locked up. I also thought it was so sad when they were watching the last movie that the prisoner got to watch before he died, and then Tom Hanks's character started to cry! I also loved how even though the prisoner was huge, he had a heart of gold, and he actually appeared cute and innocent to me during the whole movie. The only con of the movie was it took me a little bit to understand the murder of the little kids that was committed by the insane man in the movie. I also loved when the old Tom Hanks showed the old lady that he was telling the story to the mouse that was still alive. The amazing thing was i had watched this movie right after seeing Forrest Gump and I was worried that I wasn't going to be able to take Tom Hanks seriously, but I could! It just proves how amazing an actor Tom Hanks is."
"The Green Mile is based on a 1996 Stephen King novel of the same name. Done three years after the book release, the Green Mile was nominated for four Academy Awards, which included Best Supporting Actor for Michael Clarke Duncan, Best Picture, Best Sound, and Best Adapted Screenplay.The movie was directed by Frank Darabont who also developed the screenplay of the movie under an eight week period, an adapted screenplay that i have to commend as one of the best i have seen, but it lost in the Oscars to the movie The Cider House Rules. Frank Darabont was also in charge of directing the critical acclaim The Shawshank Redemption which also earned him a nomination of best Adapted screenplay in 1994.The high point of this movie will be the whole movie itself; i happen to have read the book before seeing the movie so watching a well adapted novel on the silver screen made me feel like i was reading the book all over again.The movie plot and the story itself are based on a flashback of a tale Paul Edgecomb was telling an old friend about his time as a corrections officer in charge of death row inmates in the Cold Mountain Penitentiary in 1935.The cell block Paul (Tom Hanks) worked in was called the ""Green Mile"" because the condemned prisoners walking to their execution are said to be walking ""the last mile"". Here, it is a stretch of faded lime-green linoleum. The other guards which were Paul's friends in the movie were Brutus ""Brutal"" Howell (David Morse), Harry Terwilliger (Jeffery DeMunn), and Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper).In addition to the guards was Percy (Doug Hutchison) an arrogant misfit who took pride in terrorising the inmates.Everything in the cell block was as usual until the guards got a visit from two inmates who changed their very view of life itself.One of the inmates that visited was John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) a giant of a man who had some weird miraculous power ability to heal and feel the pain and sufferings of others and the other was ""Wild Bill"" Wharton (Sam Rockwell) who was a psycho, murderer and paedophile.Their arrival was plagued with chaos miraculous healings and with the addition of Percy it became a handful for the other guards.The Green Mile is a movie i have seen over and over again, and i believe you will enjoy watching it too.www.lagsreviews.com"
"My Plot Summary:The Green Mile, set in the 1930s, is about the mental and physical health effects of working on death row. In this film the guards encounter many different men that have been put to death for various crimes. It isn't until they come across a black gentleman that has been falsely accused of raping and murdering two young girls, that they begin to really have second thoughts about execution. This inmate has the magnificent gift of healing through his faith. A mix of the inmate's gift, and the fact that he is innocent, causes the guards to question whether or not this man should be executed. The situations a person encounters in their profession can affect them for the rest of their lives. Paul Edgecomb, played by Tom Hanks, is the supervisor on death row, a dimly lit, dungeon-like building. Edgecomb has suffered major effects from the many executions that he has taken part in. He encounters a once in a lifetime experience when John Coffey, played by Michael Clarke Duncan, is sent to the Green Mile to await his execution. John Coffey is a very large and intimidating man that is extremely soft at heart. All this man wants is peace in his life from all of the hurt that is going on in the world around him. He has been blessed with the gift of healing. While he tries to help all he can he learns that it is impossible to help everyone. Paul Edgecomb's fellow prison guards are of varying personalities. Brutus Howell, played by David Morse, is a large man who has been given the nickname ""Brutal"" due to his size. In spite of the fact that he is a tall man, and somewhat intimidating, he is a kind man that comes to second guess the ruling for the execution of John Coffey. Percy Wetmore, played by Doug Hutchison, is an all around jerk who is all bark and no bite. This is proved when one of the more violent inmates grabs hold of one of his co-workers while he stands there shaking in his boots. Percy's interaction with the inmates causes John Coffey to dislike him. As a result, John Coffey has decided to ""infect"" Percy with an ailment that he cured a person of. Percy lashes out on another inmate, kills him, and then releases his ""infection."" Percy, in the end, ends up going to a mental hospital.My Review:The Green Mile, starring Tom Hanks, David Morse, and Michael Clarke Duncan, is a brilliantly written and produced piece of work. The choice of actors and actresses along with their exquisite performances could not have been better. The lighting and angles made the viewing of the movie a one of a kind experience. The artistic dimness of the lights, and dull colors within the walls of the Green Mile made this film all the more believable. It gives the viewers the sense of doom and dread that is felt by the inmates knowing that their lives are soon coming to an end because of the crimes they have committed. John Coffey, played by Michael Clarke Duncan, delivered the most convincing, amazing, and overall ground breaking performance in this film. In spite of his extra large stature, Coffey is a kind, soft hearted man who brings a lot of heart-felt emotion to the Green Mile. The attachment that the guards develop to Coffey makes it extremely hard for them to carry out his execution; there was not a dry eye amongst the guards. This film shows that any situation that is encountered in a person's profession, whether it is mental or physical, can affect them for the remainder of their lives. These men face the biggest moral obstacle they will ever come across in their lifetimes. When asked by Paul Edgecomb how he is to answer for the execution of John Coffey, he is assured by the large, gifted inmate that it is OK to execute him, that it will end his pain and he wants it to be carried out. All he wants is to end the feelings he has every day because of all of the violence and hurt in the world around him. This film is, by far, one of the best movies that I have seen in a very long time. There was laughter, tears, and amazement throughout the entirety of this film. The performance of the cast of The Green Mile was above and beyond my expectations of a film that deals with a prison setting. Tom Hanks, along with the many other actors and actresses will leave you begging for more. If you have not seen this brilliant piece of work, then it should be added to your list of must see movies for the year because it is guaranteed to please! If you liked Shawshank Redemption you will love this."
"It's not everyday that a movie is able to change an audiences opinion on something. ""The Green Mile"" is a movie that made me think long and hard about supporting the death penalty. The film, based on a novel by Stephen King, contains such a variety of emotional events that it repels its audience away from its subject rather than glamorizing it. Only a handful of recent productions have been capable of such power. ""The Green Mile"" is truly one of the best films this year and is Oscar Worthy in many categories. It is a unique, three hour experience that must be seen to believe. ""The Green Mile"" contains so many vivid performances, I will not be able to honor everyone who deserves credit in my review. Michael Jeter, Gary Sinise, Doug Hutchison, James Cromwell, Bonnie Hunt, and David Morse are all superior in strength of their characters. Each contributes Oscar worthy performances, and if the Academy leaves these individuals out at Award time, they need to recheck their databases. Michael Clarke Duncan recently received a Golden Globe nomination for his supporting role, and he deserves it. Tom Hanks is just unspeakably brilliant in the leading role. He is right behind Kevin Spacey from ""American Beauty"" in the best performance of 1999."
"Had been long waiting to see this movie. At last when it happened, it was really worth the wait. One of the few beautiful movies i have seen. Hanks comes up with yet again splendid performance and adds crisp to the good cast. Particularly Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey, WOW what to say!! He, his size, his innocence surely cant go unnoticed.Every scene creates a sort of expectation on whats going to happen next. n satisfies them pretty nicely too. It makes a good watch. It may not b a feel good movie.. but definitely makes u think a lot about humanity and human values. I am waiting to read the book from which it has been adapted"
"This is one of the best films I have seen! It really made me cry, because it was the way the characters were portrayed made it very good. The acting was great, and it was really good how they made the executions looked realistic.Even though the film was three hours long, I was able to sit through it because you wanted to find out what happened."
"Everyone remember the story about Christ and the public stoning?  Well, to the extent that ""The Green Mile"" is Christian allegory, Christ said something like this: `Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.  -Oh wait, I'M without sin!""  THUNK!Why does everyone assume that this story even takes place in a Christian universe?  Is it because so many of the characters are Christian?  But this is 1930s American South.  What did you expect?  When a character with supernatural powers of healing lumbers up, OF COURSE everyone assumes the powers are God-given; they assume his perfectly ordinary eyebrows are God-given, too; but the script gives us no reason to suppose that they're right.  Rather the reverse.  There's something random and essentially pointless about Coffey's abilities and actions, something that suits an atheist or pagan universe in which all sorts of oddities just turn up, something which doesn't justify the atmosphere of reverential ponderousness adopted by Frank Darabont and his cast.  (What IS that brown dust that Coffey spews out periodically?  Is it now OBLIGATORY for directors to run the rough footage through a computer and make it worse somehow?)  But it's a very modern sort of paganism.  There's nothing at all beautiful about the magic, which is a telling flaw.Look: it's not as bad as I thought it would be.  I THOUGHT that Darabont would have let the extravagant praise heaped upon ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (a good film, by the way) go to his head, and produce a slow, lingering, pompous version of a less interesting story.  Sort of true, but it has its moments (although, as more than one critic I've read has added, ""perhaps by chance"").  I thought Tom Hanks would be unendurable.  Surprisingly, he does a good job, all things considered.  I thought the racism would get on my nerves.  It's not really racist.  Coffey is a simpleton, but not because of the rule that blacks must be simpletons; rather, the rule is that good people must be simpletons.  (Coffey is so good he can barely form sentences.)  I thought that the bookends would waste my time and weaken the film's structure.  They do.Objectively speaking, a bad film; but, although my interest waxed and waned, it was easy to stay involved through to the end."
"Stephen King truly is a brilliant storyteller. This is another of his novels (but the first 6-parter) to be made into an instantly classic film. Featuring rich, gripping performances by David Morse, Michael Duncan, Doug Hutchison, and of course Tom Hanks, this movie presents the human struggles with good and evil, justice and law, and our ultimate fate.  Kings story telling juxtaposes often gruesomely terrible events with the true goodness of the human soul.  Because he is never afraid to present the audience horrific images of the evil potential of man, his examples of goodness and love shine through even brighter."
"The Green Mile contains the best ensemble of actors.  In any film with Hanks it would be easy to lose the other actors in such a huge shadow, but everyone shines with equal brilliance.  All the characters are believable. The script is absolutely amazing and spreads the mezmerizing dialogue around very democratically.  Also, that mouse deserves some kudos for performing so well.  The Green Mile is the best movie I have seen this year, and while sitting for three hours seems to be an awfully large commitment on behalf of the viewer, not a minute of it is ill-spent."
"I believe I am alone in my dislike of this movie.  In fairness, the acting and cinematography are excellent.  That said, the story and directing of the characters was extremely problematic for me.Here we have this man who has an incredible gift to heal others and the audience looks on in amazement as he performs miracles but at no time do the characters on screen seem freaked out, excited, or exhibit any emotion other than ""Hey lookey what he can do.  Let's get him to cure my wife.""  That ruins the whole picture for me because it was no longer believable.  If I witnessed such visually stunning miracles(stuff coming from the mouth etc.) I would be telling everyone I knew, calling scientists, papers, etc.The other characters also didn't seem too hurt that they were going to execute an innocent man.  Unbelievable!  Especially an innocent man with extraordinary powers.  In the real world many fight to keep real killers on death row alive and spare their lives but nobody fights for this man. Hogwash!"
Even though everybody I know think that this movie is one of the best ever made I disagree with them. Wile watching this movie I sat in a chair for 3 hours waiting for it to really start but...........it didn't.In my opinion this movie is a very boring 3 hour sit and I don't understand all the people who are saying that this movie is great!
"Only two things.
1. The young Paul Edgecomb. At the end? If I was him, I would have said, ""My God have mercy on my soul"" knowing what he was doing at that point.
2. Dabs Greer was on the screen long enough to deserve AT LEAST a nomination as Best Supporting Actor. Considering his incredible contributions to film and television? This was a terrible oversight!."
"Prison drama + fantasy. I didn't see that coming. It brought emotion into the picture. Some would need tissue box because it's wild till the end.
Well done. A story of life, love, loss and loyalty. A moving example of how anyone can change with more acceptance and less judgement. One of the greats."
