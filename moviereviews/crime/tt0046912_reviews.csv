"I had forgotten that most if not all of it happens in one single room. The planning of it is a display of extraordinary craftsmanship. Not a lagging moment. I was riveted to the, let's face it, preposterous plot from beginning to end. Ray Milland is a credible monster in elegant and civilized clothing. Grace Kelly, a peach as the unfaithful wife who stays home to cut newspaper clippings of her husband's past glories. Yeah, right. Robert Cummings has always been a mystery to me. A popular leading man with a long career. He only exudes a campy, if lightweight vibe that almost works in comedies and when he's in a supporting role - My Geisha and What A Way To Go with Shirley MacLaine are good examples. Here as Grace Kelly's secret lover, I don't know what to say. John Williams. very funny again as the Scotland Yard inspector, the same character to a T he played in Midnight Lace with Doris Day or was it his twin brother? In any case, no Hitchcock fan can afford to miss this filmed play, filmed by one of the undisputed greats."
"Tony Wendice (Ray Milland), an ex-tennis player, unhappily married to Margot (Grace Kelly), correctly guesses that she has been cheating, with Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). Mark writes crime stories. Unbeknown to Margot and Mark, Tony knows about the affair, and wants to teach Margot a little lesson, by taking away the thing that is her life. But, being too guileful to do it himself, Wendice blackmails one of his old school friends into murdering her, and the essential thing to doing it is his latchkey.Dial M for Murder succeeds on many levels, and it is largely thanks to some superb dialogue, written from a tricksy-yet-capable script that never gets too deep. The cast are a treat. Ray Milland is an absolute gem, extremely sly and dispassionate, yet a character so full of self-assurance that one almost sides with him. Grace Kelly completes her great year (she gave an Oscar-winning performance in The Country Girl and also starred in Rear Window) by emanating the poised, beautiful being, that is vulnerable, yet oddly unassailable. And it's weird in that even though she's cheating on her husband, you care for her a lot more than him (although that could do with the fact that he's trying to kill her...) And John Williams, as the police detective, is quite wonderful.Alfred Hitchcock manipulates and enthrals his audience here like the master that he is. Each scene has a sense of direction, great pacing, and is staged realistically. Stunning full colour photography and a haunting, atmospheric score from Dimitri Tiomkin complete this great package. The ending, when it comes, feels a little too nice to be truly realistic, but that is my only major quibble with an otherwise highly entertaining, thrilling movie."
"After earning an Academy award nomination for her performance in John Ford's 1953 tale of romance and adventure, ""Mogambo"", the beautiful actress Grace Kelly proved that she was way more than just a pretty face and that there was real talent behind her image. However, what truly took her career to new levels were three now classic films she made directed by the legendary Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. Under his direction, Kelly made an integral part of the Master's films, becoming the perfect embodiment of Hitchcock's idea of a female protagonist. While Kelly debuted two years earlier in the classic Western ""High Noon"", one could say that it was Hitchcock who really introduced the beauty and talent of Grace Kelly to the world. ""Dial M for Murder"" was the first of Hitchcock's films with Kelly, and a movie where once again the Master returns to a familiar theme: the perfect murder.The movie is the story of Tony Wendice (Ray Milland), a former tennis player married to the beautiful and wealthy Margot (Grace Kelly) and living in an nice apartment in London. Life is good for Tony, until he discovers that his wife is cheating on him with an old flame of her, famous crime novel writer Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). After that discovery, Tony spends a whole years plotting the perfect way to murder his wife in order to inherit her money, carefully planning every detail of the crime. When Mark visits London again, Tony finds the perfect chance to set his plan in motion, and as planned, he recruits Charles Swann (Anthony Dawson) to kill his wife. However, bad luck and a sudden change of events will test Tony's plan's infallibility as, just as Mark points out, human action can originate flaws even in the most perfectly devised plan.Like most Hitchcock's films, ""Dial M for Murder"" was an adaptation of another art-form, this time a popular play by Frederick Knott. As Knott was also the writer of the screenplay, the movie remains extremely faithful to the play, although of course, not without its differences. Knott's script is wonderfully constructed, as like in the play, the dialog is witty and simply captivating, with many twists and turns that spiced up the complex plot and keep it from being boring or tiresome. An interesting feature of the movie is that oddly, there are no black and white morality in the characters, and it's easy not only to sympathize with Margot (despite she being cheating on her husband) but also to sympathize with Tony (despite he wanting to kill his wife), as the characters are wonderfully developed with very detailed personalities.It seems that Hitchcock's knows that the dialog is the highlight of the play, as he deliberately focuses on his actors and uses an elegant camera-work to frame the whole movie inside the apartment. The movie literally is shot entirely in one single room (only two other sets are used, and only briefly), but Hitchcock's classy way of using the camera allow a highly dynamic flow that never lets the movie be tiresome. This is also very helpful as Hitchcock just lets his characters keep speaking, carefully describing actions and events (when other directors would use flashbacks) in a similar way to a what the real play would be. While this approach could easily get boring, Hitchcock's use of colors and overall visual imagery simply creates the perfect medium to allow Knott's dialog to shine.Without disrespecting John Ford or Fred Zinnemann, I think that it was Hitchcock who finally could allow Kelly's talent to shine beyond her physical beauty. Grace Kelly makes her character shine with her subtle and restrained performance, specially showing her skill in the second half of the film. While often Kelly receives top honors in this movie, it is actually Ray Milland who makes the whole movie work with his suave and charming ""villian"". Milland's performance is simply terrific, making his character nice enough to win the sympathies of the audience, yet still frighteningly intelligent as the mastermind of the plot. John Williams appears as the Inspector in charge to solve the complex puzzle, and delivers a classic performance as the Enlgish gentleman decided to find the final answer. Only Robert Cummings seems miscast as Mark Halliday, although a lot of his weak performance could be blamed to Milland, Kelly and Williams overshadowing him with their excellent work.In many ways, ""Dial M for Murder"" shares many things with ""Rope"", as not only the two films are based on successful plays, they are also about committing the perfect murder and oddly, they are both ""experiments"": while ""Rope"" was conceived as a ""movie in one take"", ""Dial M for Murder"" was done as 3-D movie. Sadly, the interest in 3-D was dying when the film was released, so few theaters carried the movie complete with the gimmick; a real shame, as Hitchcock's use of the technology, unlike most 3-D films of its time, was conceived as a way to enhance the claustrophobia of the Wendices' apartment instead of using it to merely shock the audience with ""stuff coming out of the screen"" (as seen in for example, ""House of Wax""). While not too fond of the gimmick, Hitchcock truly gave it a good and intelligent (albeit subtle) use to it.""Dial M for Murder"" is probably less celebrated than the Master's most famous movies, the fact that it came out the same years as ""Rear Window"" (again with Grace Kelly) may have had something to do with it too. While a subtler and more restrained tale of suspense, this is still the Master at his best, as the movie proves that when he was at the top of his game, no other director was comparable to him. 9/10"
"There is a lot to admire about Alfred Hitchcock's ""Dial M for Murder,"" and I do hold the film with a great deal of admiration and respect. However, what I adore about the movie the most (more than the cinematography, the suspense, the acting, and even the direction) is the work by screenwriter Frederick Knott. Mr. Knott based the screenplay for ""Dial M for Murder"" on his successful stage production, which I have never seen, but am told contains almost all of the words we hear in the film. And the words are music to the ears. They sing with intelligence, wit that Mr. Hitchcock certainly found attractive, and, best of all, an easy transition to the screen. Many times when a stage production goes to film, as far as I am concerned, the results, even if good, are uneven. Frequently, the dialogue and restricted set space allowed tend to give off the impression of a filmed play, not a cinematic experience. Another Hitchcock film, 1948's ""Rope,"" though valiant, interesting, and successful, attempted this and suffered from this difficult struggle.But the dialogue, put on film here, is exceptional. I write this review having seen ""Dial M for Murder"" two or three times and wanting to see it once again. Many reviewers, myself included, have tried watching films with the sound off. I want to try the opposite. I want to close my eyes and just listen to the dialogue because it's so strong. The MacGuffin conversation at the beginning, with a perfectly cast Ray Milland blackmailing a perfectly cast Anthony Dawson into murdering a perfectly cast Grace Kelly is brilliantly written by Mr. Knott. It was clearly from a stage production, as it explains the plot background in great detail, and goes on for the better part of twenty minutes. Both men are fleshed out, giving us their personalities and individual tendencies. And even though ""Dial M for Murder"" pretty much stays on just one small set (an apartment in London, in which we see mostly the foyer, a little of the bedroom, and just a glimpse of the kitchen), what happens there is so fascinating that we do not really want to venture out into the city.And that is just the setup. The dialogue remains insistently interesting and clever throughout the picture. It also has that subtle, dark sense of humor that Alfred Hitchcock was keen on. It also has the ironic touches, such as when Mr. Milland, as the jealous husband, kisses his unfaithful wife on the night she is to be murdered, and tells her: ""Goodbye, my dear."" The audience, having been given every single little detail about the scheme and how it is to unfold, cringes with a dark realization that Mr. Hitchcock might just go through with Mr. Milland's plot. Mr. Hitchcock, as the director, is also due tremendous credit for his trademark of creating tension. Screenwriter Knott brilliantly lays out for the audience, not the victim, how the murder will go through, but Mr. Hitchcock's camera dutifully follows everything as the scheme goes along. And, before we realize it, if something starts to go wrong, we become scared and tense. And you can imagine my guilt when I realized I was feeling scared that a plan to murder someone just might not go through. It's Mr. Hitchcock's gift at work.Dimitri Tiomkin, a very good film composer, hits all the write notes; that includes knowing when he needs to tell his violins and trumpets to shut up. Robert Burks' cinematography is also strong with effective usage of shadows and streaks of light. Colors are omnipresent. And even though ""Dial M for Murder"" was shot with the intent to be seen in 3D, it is hardly evident. When I first saw the film, in much superior 2D, I did not mind the lamps and such in the foreground, such as when one bisects the screen between Ray Milland and Anthony Dawson during the opening sequence. I just thought it was a clever piece of filmmaking and misc en scene, not a cheap gimmick like in most 3D movies today. ""Dial M for Murder"" is a near-perfect movie of its kind, pumped full of smart dialogue and dazzling energy. This is one of the few play-to-movie transition that I have seen where I have suddenly become eager to see the original stage production."
"A treat for the eyes and exercise for the brain, ""Dial M For Murder"" is Hitchcock's second ""drawing-room perfect murder"" movie, after ""Rope"", the latter a darker and more sinister affair altogether. Hitchcock himself in interviews played down the quality of this movie, amongst other other things indicating that it was treated almost as a warm-up for the more ambitious ""Rear Window"" which immediately followed it in his career.However. it actually has a lot going for it, being beautifully shot in luminous colour, extremely well acted in almost every role and peppered throughout with those eye-catching and brain-satisfying flourishes which so distinguished the director from the rest.Yes, it is very set-bound, betraying its stage origins and likewise very talky, especially on exposition, but it keeps the viewer alert throughout and delivers a neatly satisfying conclusion. I do wish Hitchcock could have done better with his back-projection unit (an old-fashioned, jarring trait he still hadn't grown out of by ""Marnie"" some 10 years later) and I occasionally found the constant too frivolous background music an intrusion, but it's well paced throughout, helped considerably by an on-form cast.Ray Milland is excellent in a kind of darker Cary Grant type persona, Grace Kelly (who'd want to murder her?) goes convincingly from loveliness to wretchedness while it's pleasing to see Robert Cumming to the fore, recalled by Hitch for the first time in over a decade (""since ""Saboteur"" in 1942). The actors playing the would be murderer and nosey police inspector are just fine too.About those flourishes..., perhaps the most famous being the changing spotlight on Grace Kelly's doomed face as her trial is condensed into just a few terse minutes and of course the murder scene itself, even if one can't imagine her extended stabbing gesture being strong enough to cut through Swann's jacket far less kill him stone dead, but I also enjoyed the raised tracking shot looking down on Milland as he explains his plot to Swann and particularly the parting shadows of lovers Cumming and Kelly at Milland's unexpected approach.Yes, it's old fashioned Hollywood movie-making, but it's old-fashioned Hollywood movie-making at its best and in my opinion an unjustly overlooked effort from the Master."
"1954 was a big year for Grace Kelly.  She played in Hitchcock's classic ""Rear window"" and she won an Oscar for best actress in ""The country girl"" and most people tend to forget that she starred in yet another classic, ""Dial M for murder"".  Starring Grace Kelly, Ray Milland, and Robert Cummings, it is simply one of Hitchcock's finest movies of all-time.  In fact, I would consider it to be my second favorite Hitchcock movie ever, my first being ""Psycho"" (although I haven't seen ""Rear window"" yet).  Margot (Grace Kelly) is married to Tony Wendice (Ray Milland), an ex-tennis player.  However, she has been seeing another man named Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings).  Mark writes crime stories.  The two of them think that Tony doesn't know about their relationship but they're wrong; Tony has known about this relationship for one year and seems to have had enough of it.  So when Mark, who lives in New-York, comes to London to see Margot, Tony wants to go out with Mark and his wife.  But the night of the event, Tony is unable to go.  So he tells Margot to take Mark out and to have a good time.  The only problem is that Tony doesn't really have something that's keeping him from going out with Margot and Mark.  He has another plan, the plan being to blackmail one of his old college friends that has become a small time crook into murdering his wife.  What follows this is pure entertainment at its best.  As usual, Hitchcock masterfully directs this movie and has the right actors to do the job.  Ray Milland and Grace Kelly deliver very good performances and surprisingly enough, Robert Cummings does a rather good job in his role of Mark Halliday, the American crime novel writer who accidentally stumbles on the answer. But it is John Williams who steals the show with his great performance as Inspector Hubbard, the detective who holds the key to the whole mistery.  He is simply excellent and pretty funny when he is supposed to be.  Another of his great performances is in ""Witness for the prosecution"" where he played Brogan Moore, Charles Laughton's very good friend and seconding lawyer in the case.  As for ""Dial M for murder"", well it's one of those movies that anyone should see at pretty much any cost."
"What gets me about this film every time I see it is just how simple it is. The witty urbanity of the dialogue goes without saying (hem), the acting is stagily impeccable, and the direction by Hitchcock is limited by the small sets but masterful for all that.Cold Ray Milland plans and sets up the murder of his demure but faithless wife Grace Kelly by a virtual stranger who is urged on by the stick of exposure of his misdeeds and the carrot of GBP1,000 in used notes. Of course all of his convoluted plans go horribly or thankfully wrong, depending on your point of view, leading to an even more convoluted revised plan. When first seen when young I wasted my time because I wasn't paying attention at the critical moment so missed the point and didn't get it: the key is how did the baddie get into the apartment? It's incredibly verbose, being from a stage play after all and at times it seems nothing more than a radio show with pictures. The long scene setting and verbal sparring by Milland and Anthony Dawson is superb to hear - it's fascinating for its relentless poetry, and of displaying a now-dead world. I could never understand the attraction of 3D movies, least of all with this particular attempt, or why Kelly was continually uglified by the Hollywood machine when she never looked lovelier than in here when she was playing stressed out throughout.I wonder if Hitch remembered the jokey murder scene he did in 1930 in Elstree Calling when Jameson Thomas realised he was murdering in the wrong apartment? Turn that key you have and go in, it's a remarkably literate film and as intricate inside as any lock."
"Undoubtedly, ""Dial M for Murder"" has a clever plot: Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) plans ""the perfect murder"" to do away with his wife Margot (Grace Kelly), who cheated on him with novelist Mark (Robert Cummings). He blackmails an old schoolmate into committing the crime and plants clues to mislead the police. But when things don't go according to plan, Tony has to plant new clues and think of another explanation to give the detectives, so that suspicion doesn't fall on him.The trouble is, the plot is the only interesting thing about this movie, and the characters are defined solely by how they can affect the plot. For instance, Mark writes mystery novels only because this explains his ability to ""read"" the crime scene. Most of the movie's dialogue is expository: long scenes where the characters debate the minutiae of evidence found at the scene, without an interesting subtext. The movie is known for taking place almost entirely in the Wendices' living room, and Hitchcock does a good job of varying the camera angles to make you forget there's just one set. But he did this even better in ""Rear Window,"" his other 1954 film.Admittedly, Milland gives an enjoyable performance as the villaintruly a guy you love to hate, a clever and smiling sociopath. But Kelly and Cummings are surprisingly boring for a pair of adulterous lovers. Kelly also proves herself the ancestor of all those female horror- movie characters who go investigating strange noises in their best lingerie.""Dial M for Murder"" is lightweight without actually being funnya fatal combination. Though serious concerns (adultery, murder, the death penalty) underlie the story, we're never made to feel that they are really consequential. It's a cold and mechanical movie, which subordinates everything else to the demands of an intricate plot. Contrast this with something like ""Rear Window,"" whose plot is simple and lacking in twists, but whose characters are vividly drawn and act as though their stories really meant something. Having a clever solution to a mystery does not a great movie make."
"This is a fine example of the kind of mystery that little old ladies  from Pasadena (or Russell Square) adore. Perhaps Arsenic and Old Lace  (1944) starring Cary Grant might be comparable in its gentile and  bloodless ability to glue us to the screen.  This is certainly one of Hitchcock's best, but most of the credit must  go to a devilishly clever play written by Frederick Knott from which  the movie was adapted. (He also wrote Wait Until Dark (1967) starring  Audrey Hepburn.) Hitchcock does a good job in not tinkering  unnecessarily with the material. He also has the exquisitely beautiful  Grace Kelly to play the part of Margot Wendice.  Ray Milland plays, with a kind of high-toned Brit panache, her  diabolical husband, Tony Wendice, a one-time tennis star who married  mostly for security. John Williams is the prim and proper Chief  Inspector Hubbard. He lends to the part a bit of Sherlock Holmesian  flair. One especially liked his taking a moment to comb his mustache  after the case is solved. Robert Cummings, unfortunately plays Margot's  American boyfriend as inventively as a sawhorse. For those of you who  might have blinked, Hitchcock makes his traditional appearance in the  photo on the wall from Tony Wendice's undergraduate days.  The fulcrum of the plot is the latchkey. It is the clue that  (literally) unlocks the mystery. There is a modernized redoing of this  movie called A Perfect Murder (1998) starring Michael Douglas and  Gwyneth Paltrow in which a similar business with latchkeys is employed.  I am not very good with clues so it was only after seeing that movie  and Dial M for Murder for the second time that I finally understood  what happened. Follow the latchkey!  Of course I was too distracted by Grace Kelly to fully appreciate such  intricacies. I found myself struck with the ironic notion that anyone,  even a cuckolded husband, might want to kill Grace Kelly or that a jury  might find her guilty of anything! She remains in my psyche America's  fairytale princess who quit Hollywood at the height of her popularity  after only five years and eleven movies to become a real princess by  marrying Prince Rainier of Monaco. Something was lost there, and  something was gained. She was in essence the original Jackie Kennedy  Onassis. I think, however, that the old saw about the man who marries  for money, earning it, might apply to American princesses as well.  At any rate, Grace Kelly's cool and sublime bearing was on fine display  here. Hitchcock cloths her in discreet nightgowns and snug (but  certainly not clinging) dresses that show off her delicate figure and  her exquisite arms and hint oh so coyly at her subtle sexuality. She  was 25-years-old, stunningly beautiful, and in full confidence of her  ability as an actress. She had just finished starring opposite James  Stewart in another splendid Hitchcock one-room mystery, Rear Window  (1954), and was about to make The Country Girl (1954) with Bing Crosby  for which she would win an Oscar for Best Actress.  So see this for Grace Kelly who makes Gwyneth Paltrow (whom I adore)  look downright gawky, and for Ray Milland whose urbane scheming seems a  layer or two of hell removed from Michael Douglas's evil manipulations.  By the way, the ""original theatrical trailer"" preceding these Warner  Brothers Classic videos is what we used to call the ""Coming  Attractions""--that is, clips directly from the movie and a promo. You  might want to fast forward to the movie itself."
"Surprisingly this is a lesser-known Hitchcock film but still stands up today as an exciting thriller full of twists and turns.Ray Milland is excellent as ex-tennis pro Tony Wendice who decides to commit the perfect murder of his wife (Grace Kelly) when he learns of her affair with Robert Cummings (who isn't given much to do). In fact, Milland's subtle performance has you wanting the murder plot to work! Though it has to be said, Kelly's helpless female turn does not help in this regard either.Hitchcock's skill here is to totally involve the viewer in the labyrinthine plot involving keys, telephone calls and stockings so that at the end of the film you haven't even noticed that virtually all the scenes are in one room.If you like clever, wordy films with a touch of humour then I recommend `Dial M For Murder'. 8/10"
"The hit Broadway play by Frederick Knott ""Dial M for Murder"" has been adapted to the screen several times, including the films made in West Germany and Sweden, as well as a TV movie in 1981 (TV) by Boris Seagal and the film ""A Perfect Murder"" (1998) directed by Andrew Davis with Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Viggo Mortensen. Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 adaptation was the first and certainly the best one even if the master himself considered it one of his lesser efforts. ""Dial M for Murder"" will be remembered as Hitchcock's first color film and the first of three thrillers he had made with Grace Kelly, the future Princess of Monaco, in the prime of her beauty and her talent. Using color proved to be very effective in the film. The first two scenes featuring Kelly wearing a white morning dress in the idyllic scene with her husband Tony and right after that kissing passionately her American lover, writer (Robert Cummings) in the red dress, immediately, without many words tell the viewer that the story of passion, deception, betrayal, and ultimately, murder will follow. Ray Milland (Tony Wendice) is a surprisingly sympathetic villain (which is perhaps not surprising from the actor with talent, charm, and charisma that equal and remind a lot of both Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart) who knows about his wife cheating and decides to teach her a lesson by plotting a very clever murder which will make him a sole heir to her money (she is a wealthy one in the family). His plan is perfect and almost works but Margot managed to not only escape the murderer but to turn the table on him while stunned Wendice is on the phone and listens how his well thought of plan collapses. Wendice is very resourceful and he proved to be a master of improvisation because it took him a few minutes in a cab to switch to a plan B that turned a terrified victim Margot into a cold-blooded murderess. Now it is up to seasoned and shrewd inspector Hubbard (John Williams) to find the crucial piece of evidence and to solve the case.As always with Hitchcock, his directing is impeccable, the camera rarely leaves Wendice's apartment but the film is never claustrophobic which is the case for many plays' adaptation. It breathes and moves freely and we almost forget that we are in the same room for close to two hours. I would not call ""Dial M for Murder"" my favorite Hitchcock's film but it is enjoyable, clever, and witty thriller with the interesting twists, outstanding performances, and more than one truly memorable scenes."
"Hitchcock brings the successful play, Dial M for Murder by Frederick Knott, to life in a shocking new way. Adapted by use of the amazing 3D technology.This movie is unique for Hitchcock in many ways. It is shot entirely in one room, yet there is never a moment of claustrophobia. As for many movies in the early 50's, it was shot in 3D. And you will at times notice scenes that play into that, but are done with the greatest of expertise. Also he chose not to change the play at all, but rather ride it out.As the aging tennis pro or the jealous husband, Ray Milland is solid all the way through. And what can I say about Grace Kelly. Behind only Ingrid Bergman and Donna Reed, as the most beautiful and talented actresses of all time. She never fails to impress. She can be quite a darling and at the same time a spectacular bitch.Probably my favorite Hitchcock film, since it is the first one I saw. I was introduced to him very early in life at the age of 7, by my wicked older sister. For years Psycho haunted me and Vertigo confused. But I do thank her for Notorious and Rear Window. Dial M for and North by Northwest.Seems to me that Hitch was not the most attractive guy, yet like all of us he favored beautiful women. Especially blonde's. This leads me to the question of, what does a guy like Hitchcock know about women? Maybe simply, how to kill them."
"Mostly enjoyable movie, but hardly a 'great' movie. I am most disappointed by the lack of depth in the Grace Kelly and Cummings characters, which are both one-note uninteresting roles. Grace Kelly is wasted in a passive, weak, and vapid role which relegates her to the status of window dressing (not that there is anything wrong with that!), she might as well be a nice looking piece of furniture in this movie. The Cummings role is wasted as the passion between him and Kelly is not developed, and amazingly, the tension that would exist between Milland and Cummings is never apparent!. This guy was sleeping with Milland's wife, but you would think they were best friends. What a waste. Would have been a lot more interesting if Kelly and Cummings were not such bland, cardboard harmless people and were a little more human, with real emotions (jealousy, hatred, passion, even a little evil).Milland makes the move interesting to watch as he sets his plan in motion with great charm and flair. Unfortunately, as he is the only interesting character, you kind of feel bad when he is caught in the end and the two sappy characters prevail. Oh well, it could have been a lot more 'noir' if they had not glossed over the fact that Kelly and Cummings are far from the sweet innocents they are portrayed."
"Ray Milland schemes to knock off his lovely wife (Grace Kelly) in order to support his flagging bank balance...His cause is ""justified"" by the fact that his wife is guilty of cheating on him...Milland develops a carefully constructed murder plan, contacting Captain Lesgate (John Williams), an old college classmate operating illegal ventures, to whom he outlines his murder scheme and then blackmails into carrying it out... The movie takes off from there as an intense character battle between three different characters... Tony, done by Ray Milland in outstanding performance, is icily intense and incredibly wild. He is easily the best of the three... Grace Kelly & Robert Cummings both pale in comparison, although Grace is slightly better, for the merely reason that her character is left for to do the least amount of truly suspenseful acting...The murder is set up and is deliciously evil: The defining moment is when Ray Milland wipes clean every object he touches as he explains to Anthony Dawson how to carry out the murder of his adulterous wife, thus not incriminating himself... They discuss the closing of the screen door to the porch, the placement of the golden key, and the time it will take his woman to answer the distracting phone call...Grace Kelly is the smart but vulnerable Margot... She begins her role dressed in bright crimson reds but as the film progresses and finds herself accused, her outfits become darker... Kelly is ingénue enough to be sympathetic but also tough enough to be respected... Her most memorable image was on the phone, oblivious to the assassin behind her... Robert Cummings does not fare at all because of his comical face... He is the weakest cast member bringing so little to the table... John Williams is excellent as the dangerous murder weapon tricked by a clever scoundrel... but he somewhere along makes one fatal mistake...Anthony Dawson is absolutely brilliant, delightful as the eccentric Chief Inspector watching how the easy-talking husband is trying to cover his tracks... As soon as he arrives on scene to investigate the murder, there's an instant feeling of electricity... Here's a guy who can read human nature from a mile away... He takes compassion on Kelly, but unfortunately, the two don't partner up as in cop buddy movies...The film, however, belongs to the sinister Ray Milland, the cold logic husband who designs the murder to look like a routine burglary gone wrong, and leads Scotland Yard into believing his wife is guilty of deliberate murder...Milland, a genteel charmer with an icy murderous side, is perfect as Tony Wendice... If ever there was a demonstration of venality, Milland's Tony Wendice was it: courteous on the outside, devious on the inside... We see his cheery domestic manner with his wife... He blithely sends her out for the evening with her lover, then without breaking his stride sits down at the telephone and calls Swan, the man he intends to enlist for the murder... There is something chilling about the way in which Milland operates in these scenes: Once Swan arrives, the polite smile never leaves Milland's face as he switches gears from exchanging pleasantries to blackmail and murder.. The entire scene was shot from the ceiling...'Dial M for Murder' holds its grip pretty well... Hitchcock provides the tension in many directorial tricks: Margot's unexpected change in plans for the evening; a hiding place for a key blocked by Mark at a critical moment; a stopped watch; an occupied telephone box; Margot's wavering hand holding the telephone that almost blocks Swan's access to her neck; Tony taking the key out of Swan's pocket and even briefing his wife what to tell the police...'Dial M for Murder' is a classic stage murder thriller... It never reaches the heights that 'Rear Window' did, but it has to be one of the most brilliant stage thrillers ever written... The score, composed by Dimitri Tiomkin, is both eerie & precarious...""Dial M for Murder"" is a film that makes you pay attention. It is a definite must-see!"
"Thrilling and suspense movie based on Frederick Knott's play , author of other successful and equally adapted books as ¨Wait until dark¨ and ¨The honey pot¨ . A London ex-tennis pro (Ray Milland) carries out a plot to murder his wife and then he hires a killer (Anthony Dawson who recreates his stage role) . When things go wrong , he improvises a brilliant plan B . In the city , wealthy Margot Mary Wendice (Grace Kelly) had a brief love affair with the American writer Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings) while her husband and professional tennis player Tony Wendice was on a tennis tour . But his plan for pulling off the perfect crime is temporarily foiled and quickly switches to another plan . Meanwhile a Police Inspector (John Williams who won the 1953 Tony Award to recreate his stage role of Chief Inspector Hubbard) investigates the deeds .Top-notch suspense film of a man plotting spouse's killing , full of sustained intrigue , thrills , a few interesting twists and entertainment . The picture , stagy at times , is formed by two parts , a Plan A and a Plan B with even more fun . Casting is frankly magnificent , the stars are excellently cast . Splendid performances from Ray Milland as a rather likable nasty who desires to inherit his wife's fortune and John Williams as an obstinate Inspector who carries out the subsequent investigation . Furthermore , a gorgeous and wonderful Grace Kelly ; Hitch arranged to have Grace dressed in bright colors at the start of the film and made them progressively darker as time goes on. Colorful and shimmer cinematography by Robert Burks who uses intelligent camera vantages , being photographed in Technicolor and 3D , which explains the prevalence of low-angle shots with lamps and other objects between us and the cast members. Thriller and suspenseful musical score by the classic Dimitri Tiomkin . The movie was skillfully shot in 36 days: August 5-September 25 1953 , by the maestro Hithcock , including his well-known touches and as usual the same appears a cameo on the left side of the reunion photograph .

"Six years after Rope, Hitchcock released another adaptation from a play, still behind closed doors, but a lot more conventional than its experimental predecessor. Unfortunately, although Dial M for Murder is a real improvement, it is not free from flaws, of which some are recurrent with the English director.It's a shame because it started pretty well. One easily gets carried away by the flowing dialogues, and wonders where this story is going to lead to. Granted though it is a bit far-fetched but nonetheless it arouses curiosity. Unfortunately, as soon as we pass the murder (and the intermission), the script struggles a little too much until the final outcome. The second part lacks tension, suspense, but most importantly rhythm which is strongly crippling, let alone for a confined movie.Once again, and as it happens too often with Hitchcock, this is a lukewarm feature, not a total flop but not fully accomplished either."
"In London, the wealthy Margot Mary Wendice (Grace Kelly) had a brief love affair with the American writer Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings) one year ago while her husband and professional tennis player Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) is traveling in a tennis tour. Tony quits playing to dedicate to his wife and finds a regular job and she decides to give a second chance for their marriage. When Mark arrives from America to visit the couple, Margot tells him that she had destroyed all his letter but one that was stolen in a depot; then she was blackmailed through letters but she had never retrieved the stolen letter. Tony arrives home and claims that he needs to work, and asks Margot to go with Mark to the theater. Meanwhile Tony calls the scum Captain Lesgate - aka Charles Alexander Swann (Anthony Dawson) that studied with him in the college and blackmails him to murder his wife, so that he would inherit her fortune. But there is no perfect crime, and things do not work as planned by Tony.""Dial M for Murder"" is one of the best thrillers of cinema history, with a theatrical story supported by an excellent screenplay and top-notch performances. Ray Milland is superb in the role of the Machiavellian and cynical Tony Wendice; Grace Kelly is extremely gorgeous and sweet in the role of a wife in the 50's; and John Williams is great in the role of the efficient and fussy Chief Inspector Hubbard. This time, the cameo of Alfred Hitchcock is in the picture of Tony's reunion. In 1998, Andrew Davis remade this movie with ""A Perfect Crime"", with Michael Douglas, Gwineth Paltrow and Viggo Mortensen. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Disque M para Matar"" (""Dial M for Murder"")"
"I must admit that I scanned through all the comments on this film hoping that someone somewhere might agree with my assessment of the plot as being absurdly overcomplicated. Surely it was relatively straightforward to get an extra key cut even in the 1950s, which would have stopped all the ridiculous key swapping activities. At times, it seemed more like a magician's (con man's?) act - now you see it, now you don't - rather than a mystery/thriller. I thought it was quaint that the local police were called instead of the emergency services when there is a dead body in the apartment.  Perhaps we had the ethos of your local, friendly neighbourhood cop on the beat in those days who would clear it all up quite amicably and we could all get on with our lives, and perhaps be more careful in future. Not only are keys swapped with gay abandon but also raincoats (unnoticed, of course). Not at all sure why the crime-writer boyfriend of the wife agreed to go to a stag night with the husband, just after he had admitted that he would find it very difficult talking to the bloke, who he hardly knew anyway. The whole thing just fails to be anywhere near believable.  Why on earth are all the comments favourable?"
"For all those who love to watch thriller, Dial M for Murder is a perfect one from the best director of all time. The story is so interesting and it will bind you to your seat.Recently I heard about this movie and from that time I was looking for it. I went to video library so many times for looking this title and I got it after 3 long weeks. But when I saw this movie I was quite amazed and quite pleased.The plot is superb and Ray Milland did an excellent work. John Williams even has an equally powerful role and performance.The main thing about this film, which I enjoyed most is how the story progresses and how the suspense come out layer by layer. Everything is just perfect in this film, the story, the characters, the plot. I enjoyed this movie so much.For all the fans of thriller, murder and crime, it is an excellent film. Hats off to the Alfred Hitchcock. From me its 9/10."
"With ""Dial M For Murder"", the Master signs another classic of mystery, starring for the first time, the actress who'd become the quintessential Hitchcock blonde, Grace Kelly. And as much as I appreciated the much more acclaimed ""Rear Window"", I sincerely believe this is one of Hitchcock's finest achievements, which is saying a lot considering his glorious oeuvre, but ""Dial M for Murder"" takes a special place in my heart, because it represents for many reasons, the typical Hitchcockian film, by many standards.I. Dial M for  MurderThe Murder takes place right in the middle of the story and like in ""Psycho"", it's defined by what precedes and what follows, it's the emotional reward of a patient but powerful build-up while the resolution is an intelligent case of manipulation. The build-up is the construction of a perfect crime, Tony Wendice, played by Ray Milland, presents to the killer, a remarkable Anthony Edwards, the killing's plan as if it was a simple technical operation, following an incredibly methodical scheme, admirably meticulous if it wasn't for the purpose of killing. Hitchcock's masterful direction creates a plot within the plot, at a point you wonder if you're watching the adapted play within a film, or a film that transcended the confined setting of the play. And the second and crucial element of the build-up subtly hints the fact that there's always a human factor that undermines any attempt of perfectionism. So, when comes the time of the murder, we have these two parameters, we know how it should happen, but we keep in mind that whatever must go wrong will go wrong. How? When? Where? This is what the whole first part of the suspense is about.II. Dial M for  MistakeWhat could have been a lazy exercise of adaptation becomes in the hands of the Master, an extraordinary thriller confined in an elegant room sometimes welcoming, sometimes claustrophobic. The handling of the space and the various objects that occupy it, a telephone, sockets, scissors, keys, the way the camera shows them or hides them till the right moment is crucial in the way they organize what would lead to the fatal mistake. We only see what the characters can see and Hitchcock's manipulative effects consists on the way he lets the human factor affect the story only during the villainous parts. As much as we don't really care for the love story, because Christopher Hummings who plays the lover, Halliday, is probably the least charismatic of all, we sort of root for the villains, because of that 'humanity' displayed by the mistake. The point is that the murder is so well crafted, that there's a little evil voice inside us that wishes it could work, but again, this is Grace Kelly, and the sight of that creature in danger immediately reverses the rooting process, and then while her hands desperately seek a providential help, one pair of scissors theatrically conclude the heart of the film and the ruthless killer, becomes a worthless killer, before falling as a victim, or a collateral damage at best. The mistake is not just a plot device, it's Hitchcock's cynical insertion of humanity in a rather cold and emotionless mindset.III. Dial M for  ManipulationThere's an interesting trivia about the title's translation in French: ""The Crime Was Almost Perfect"", which conveys the inevitability of human factor like fate in Greek tragedies. It is, no pun intended, the key element of the evolution and resolution of the plot, when Wendice will exploit the mistake to his advantage. Tony Wendice is impressive, because he's simply predicted everything, and he puts the level so high, that even Halliday couldn't accuse him, although, in the way he deconstructed the murder when trying to convince Wendice to find an alibi to save his wife Margot from execution, he concluded on what could have been the true motive of the murder but he was not in the same caliber than his opponent, hence the entrance of Detective Hubbard, played by an elegant, suave and scene-stealing John Williams. And it's only justice, that he could outfight Wendice by using his very weapon, manipulation. It's all about manipulating objects, space and people and on that level, Wendice found his archenemy.IV. Dial M for  MillandRay Milland is perfect as the quintessential upper class villain, elegant, sophisticated and absolutely and totally unflappable, and I use the word 'perfect' as the reference to the French title. A perfect murder needs a perfect villain whose perfect scheme wouldn't be undermined by any external factor, except something under his own control. The casting of Milland also works because he's the one who outshines the other characters, his wife is the victim, the man he hires also appear as the victim, when he tries to kill Grace, you can look on his eyes, that he was a 'casting' error, Milland also underestimated his wife's strength as she managed to overcome her fear and become the killer. But Milland is the only one who doesn't change, totally unflappable, he's the pillar of the film, and the film is so confident that even when he's caught, he doesn't flinch an eye.V. Dial M for  MelodramaThe film also allows to insert some melodramatic elements to engage our sympathy toward the couple, but it's clear that this just works as the foil to justify the murder, and inspire some sympathy toward Milland, when you see him with Margot, all in white, in the opening scene, then she's wearing a bright and dazzling red dress with Halliday. In one minute, Hitchcock masterfully highlighted the treachery that would inspire Tony's crime. The love will be Halliday's motive to fight for innocence but again, it's only with the same weapons that Wendice could've been defeated. so whether it's for murder, manipulation, Milland or melodrama, you know you'll dial a definite M for  Masterpiece."
"I recently saw this again, but I will make this comment on a viewing I had many years ago.I was sponsoring some research on human interfaces, and the center of expertise at the time was coordinated by an Air Force Lab out of Dayton Ohio. Some of the more clever guys at the lab had connections with hobbyists in the area, and also with local film enthusiasts connected with the city artfilm theater. They'd arranged for a reconstruction of the three-D version of this. I made a special trip for what was billed as the only week ever this would be shown.It was originally filmed in 3D, using an unusual process. Two cameras made two color prints. These were delivered together to the theater and shown with two synchronized projectors on the same screen through polarizing lenses. Polarized glasses allowed the viewer to see color 3D.Almost immediately after release, the process was abandoned because the projectors required amazing skill and were extraordinarily complicated, expensive and unreliable. To reconstruct the original effect, several years went into the location of most of the original projectors so that parts could be cannibalized to create the complete kit of Siamese twin projectors. Some missing precision parts may have been fabricated in a spooky government research lab; I cannot say. That was only the first impossibility.What had happened shortly after the film was released over 50 years ago, within a few months, was that the left and right prints were separated and distributed as ""ordinary"" versions. To reconstruct a pair, you need to have every single frame match. But no prints had all frames complete. Some had been edited by exhibitors for various reasons like time. Others had been broken and respliced and some of those repairs even reversed. Some had frames snipped to create publicity stills. Still others had both some left and some right elements.It apparently was a tremendous effort to scan all prints a frame at a time and reconstruct a matched pair. A previous 3D version had been released, but it was no help, in fact unwatchable. It reduced the process to the older black and white and didn't do the matching this team did. Its horrible, and not even 3D in some places.So I made a special trip to see this in Dayton as it was intended. Hitchcock made this in his spare time while preparing for his masterful ""Rear Window."" It was already a hit play, and his contribution was to design the blocking for 3D. Its important because Hitchcock was a master in advancing the notion of a spatial camera, a space-savvy eye. Some of what he did here is not only extraordinary on its own, but it can be seen as a sort of sketchpad for some of the indirectly referenced effects on ""Rear Window."" So if you are interested in the world, then you are interested in film in space, and then ""Rear Window,"" and as a result this in 3D.I not only saw this, but arranged to have the optimum seat in the house. And the place was packed with some of the most enlightened viewers I knew and the swelling of sighs at points was palpable. It was an extraordinary experience. The vision research lab was destroyed shortly thereafter because of Republican actions in Congress. I believe the reconstructed projection machinery was effectively lost forever, so the window may have closed to see this properly.You'll have to extrapolate the 3D effects from a two-d print. Its not impossible I suppose. I'll give you some clues. He places the camera in one of three modes, alternating among them depending on whether we are colluding, witnessing or dissecting. (The trial scene is excluded from this.) Obviously, these viewer modes are interleaved appropriately with which character we conspire with: the husband (a performer), the boyfriend ""mystery writer,"" or the detective. Its easy to work out and quite thrilling to see how he has ""dialed"" the vision.This is a replacement comment, the original having been deleted (along with scores of others) by a reader unhappy with comments elsewhere I made about an unrelated actor.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"Reading these comments you'd think that this was the perfect film. An incredible plan of the perfect murder. The problem is that none of the characters are likable, the plot contains more holes than Swiss Cheese and police that act far out of character so as not to be believable whatsoever.This movie has aged badly. The contrivances of old films are all present here. I was wondering whether this was a play of some sort and lo and behold it was. Like Hitchcock's other loser film, Rope, this one has annoying characters doing things that people just don't do. The film takes place primarily in one room, the apartment.Rear Window is a far superior film to this one. Like most films, the fawning fans gladly overlook the horrendous flaws so that they can proudly proclaim ""Ooooh, it's a Hitchcock!"" This is just a conceit where Hitchcock thinks he can lazily work his genius and all the fools in the audience won't notice. You will. You'll be asking yourself one question from the start, being... ""why the heck not make a third copy of the key?"" That's just for starters. The last third of the film you'll be groaning... don't say I didn't warn you."
"In order to get his hands on his wife's fortune, washed up tennis star Tony Wendice plans to have her killed.  In a carefully planned plot, he approaches a small time conman and blackmails him into helping.  However the carefully planned set up goes wrong and Margot kills Swan in a struggle. When the ensuing police investigation assumes that Margot set the whole thing up, everything appears perfect for Tony.  However, there is no such thing as the perfect murder.Although it is very much a stage play rather than a film, this still works well as a thriller due to solid (if unspectacular) performances and good direction.  The film s split into three main acts  the planning, the deed and the conclusion.  The planning is easily the most enjoyable part as it moves quickly and seems to have everything tied up.  The deed is good as we begin to see little things go wrong and the conclusion is enjoyable as the pieces are put together.  The plot is quite straightforward, but it's strength is in it's logic  both in set up and conclusion.  It is a little dull at times due to it's static location (almost 100% of the film is in the flat) but Hitchcock does manage to deliver real tension at key moments.The gimmick of 3D (as the film was originally shot to be) means that the film is cluttered with shots of action in the background and furniture in the foreground.  It all feels slightly weird to have such a good director frame his shots in this way but it is not too obtrusive.  He does better with the dramatic stuff and manages to give a cold, logical air to the planning stages and also makes the actual murder scene very dramatic.The cast deliver quite polished performances without every stretching themselves outside of the character they have been placed in.  So Kelly plays the bewildered wife well, Cummings is a typical tough jawed American and Dawson is a bit of a sub-Terry Thomas.  However it is Milland as the coldly English plotter who makes the film quite watchable in it's first act and is very enjoyably `English'.  The final act of the film is made to feel different enough to enjoy due to the input of Wiliams as the Inspector  he is witty but also a good match for Tony.Overall this film is a little too stagy for it's own good but it is still a solid little thriller.  The setting make it feel a little too confined and staged than was necessary, but Hitchcock is able to use the location well rather than be hampered by it (3D aside).  An old fashioned detective film in the style of a B movie."
"Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) is an aging tennis pro who learns that his wealthy wife (Grace Kelly as Margot) has a lover (Bob Cummings as Mark). Tony figures out what might have led his wife astray and fixes it - he gets a real job with a real boss. But what if his wife divorces him? He'd get nothing! Realizing that getting a job may have enlarged his wife's respect for him but not diminished her affection for the lover, he spends a large amount of time figuring out a perfect way to kill his wife so that he can inherit her money. Tony has nothing personal against Margot and her infidelity, he just can't take the chance of winding up penniless. He can't do the job himself - the husband is always the prime suspect in such matters. So, he must find someone who will be willing to do the job for him. He's not the type who hangs with organized crime types, so he has to find someone already guilty of murder but yet untouched by the law and get that person to agree to do the job for him.It sounds perfect. Tony even has the lover with him as an alibi the night the murder is to occur. But everything does go wrong, and now Tony has to retool his perfect murder. Who will kill Margot for Tony? The law of course! Watch this great little thriller and see what I'm talking about.Most directors lose a step after they are in their 50's. There is just something about their creativity that just fizzles, and I say that as someone who is 55 myself. But here Hitchcock is at age 55 doing some of his best and most clever work. This one is so ironic it could be considered a film noir if not for the elegance of the players, the setting, and that great score.Just one thing that nobody ever seems to talk about much - did anybody else want Tony to get away with it just a little? He does play it icy cold and smiling throughout, but when he makes the phone call that sets everything in motion, you can see the regret in his face - the fact that he hates that this is the way that it must be. Meanwhile my sympathy was not with the cheating wife and especially the false friend Mark Halliday. The guy was sleeping with a man's wife while pretending to be his friend, even carrying on a kissing session with her while the husband went down the street for an errand. If you're going to steal someone's wife, let it be a stranger's. Don't shake the guy's hand, eat the guy's food, and accept his hospitality and take his wife behind his back too. Maybe Hitch wanted the audience to be conflicted though, maybe he was trying to add to the complexity of the situation with this added dimension. At any rate, watch this if you get a chance. In fact, watch it more than once. You'll always see something you didn't see before."
"This is considered a ""sophisticated"" crime film and it does have some interesting dialog and a story that keeps your interest. You have to pay attention, particularly at the end when the British police inspector explains how he figured things out.Ray Milland is the big star of this show, being in almost all the scenes. This kind of suspense movie is unheard of today - a thinking man's gentleman as the main bad guy - with little action in the film. That wouldn't be a success today. It was re-made in 1998 but had more twists and action scenes added.In this film, as in that re-make (A Perfect Murder), I found myself rooting for the husband. In this case, it was Millland, although he was a bit cocky.Note: It's a sad comment that Hitchcock, who didn't seem to have a lot of principles, made Robert Cummings - who was an adulterer in this film having an affair with Milland's wife Grace Kelly - into a ""good guy."" Nobody in the film challenged him on what he was doing. Apparently, adultery was okay with the filmmakers here. At least in the re-make, they made the adulterer into a scumbag (although they made the cheating wife into a sympathetic character! No matter who makes this film, they are still clueless when it comes to what's right and what's wrong!.)"
"DIAL M FOR MURDER is no masterpiece - its source material, though amusing is too mechanical and obvious, with an unravelling that is disappointingly implausible.  Grace Kelly is a terrible actress, but she doesn't even have the crutch of her legendary beauty here, as her humiliation goes hand in hand with increasing dowdiness.  And yet the film is a must-see: not only because every Hitchcock film is rich in style and meaning, but for two cherishable performances from Ray Milland and John Williams; for an extraordinary, abstract courtroom scene; and for a remarkable play with theatrical metaphors.Robin Wood sees many Hitchcock films as analyses of marriage, and DIAL M FOR MURDER is no exception.  Even from the beginning we know there's something wrong with the Wendice union - the opening clench is theatrical, cold, unreal.  The family home is not comforting, but made strange: objects don't blend in, but are threateningly present (lamps, drinks bottles etc.), always getting in the way of human communication (the telephone is an apt metaphor for the crisis in the film).  In a traditional detective story, it is through the displacement of ordinary items, taken for granted, that marks a rupture - the everyday becomes frightening.Wendice is unable to satisfy his wife - he is only interested in her money. when he talks to Swan about his marital difficulties, he walks with a cane, ostensibly a fake prop, but a clear hint of the impotence rejected when he drops it and talks of the murder that will reassert his patriarchal role. He is like a servant in his own home, dependent on his wife, serving her and her lover drinks.  He is probably gay - the handbag which has been transferred in association from his wife to him, is made the butt of a homophobic jibe by Inspector Hubbard.Most importantly, the conjugal home resembles a stage set.  This is the governing motif of the film.  Hitchcock subverts the hokey sentiments and values of Knott's play, by drawing attention to its staginess.  Props are foregrounded; Wendice is clearly a stage director/author who is putting on a play (planning the murder of his wife).  He talks to Swan like he's a director instructing an actor, giving him his lines, showing him round the stage, telling him what to do, where to move; crucially, giving him his cue, timing, the 'call'.However, although Wendice seems in control, the gaze of the film does not belong to him - his authority is already undermined long before his plot unravels.  Frequently filmed in distanceng wide angle, this scene with Swan is shot from above, spied on from a seemingly unmotivated, godlike position, which only emhasises the unreality (theatricality) of the sequence.  There is another author beyond Wendice, who is really running the play.  Is it God?  Fate?  Hubris?  This position of authority is jostled for by the four male characters, in a frequently homoerotic manner.The only time this kind of shot becomes motivated, it belongs to the Inspector, suggesting that the law is the godlike arbiter, from whom nothing can be hidden.  And this is true, but not reassuring: the Inspector is cold and detached; but, more unforgiveably, like the other male characters, two of whom tried to murder her, he sadistically inflicts pain on Mrs. Wendice, pushing her out of the story, in effect succeeding where Wendice and Swan failed; she is absent for most of the film's second half.  The law is shown to be both frightening and whimsical, rather like an Old Testament God. This is not comforting.This link between the author and authority, both trying to shape meaning, and 'create' truth, while in reality concealing it (Hubbard's assertion of patriarchal truth denies Mrs. Wendice's emotional reality) is linked to a story which is invoked in the film's opening MacGuffin, the stolen letter. Poe, a favourite of Hitchcock's, wrote 'The Purloined Letter' about a missive stolen by a respectable government minister, form a Queen possibly enjoying an adulterous relationship.  What's written in this letter, and who controls it, becomes a site of power between the two male characters, who squeeze out the female character, who owns it, altogether.  Knowledge, authority, power, and the artist are linked, all are abused, all are stolen from women.  Mrs. Wendice's absence in the middle of the film is the anguish seething behind the film's (or play's) smooth mechanics.  Anyone who thinks Hitchcock is just a technician is an idiot.  he had a profound grasp on the workings of society, and how people are sacrificed for it.He also shows the seductive appeal of power - Wendice is suave, hilarious, imperious, mandarin, the motor of the film, a joy to watch, and yet an automaton.  Hubbard's victory over him relies on Wendice's working like clockwork.  The author was really only an actor, parroting perfectly his fed lines.  It's significant that it should be a real author who exposes him."
"Alfred Hitchcock serves up a grand suspense yarn about an elaborate murder-for-hire scheme. Ray Milland, Grace Kelly and Robert Cummings form the triangle in the case of a husband who wants to eliminate his wife in order to inherit her considerable wealth. That his wife is involved in an extramarital affair means little to him as he sets into motion his plan that eventually unravels due to dogged detective work. As with most murder mysteries, money is the reason Milland wants to dispatch Kelly and enlists the help of an outsider to do the dirty work. John Williams is the droll inspector who takes the case apart and puts it back together with logic and old fashioned police sleuthing. The film has a parallel with another Hitchcock film, ""Rope"", in that both pictures were filmed almost entirely with one set piece. Still, this mystery remains one of the genre's best films."
"One of Alfred Hitchcock's best-known films, ""Dial M For Murder"" is a carefully crafted and absorbing cat-and-mouse game that keeps the viewer's attention all the way until the end.  The very simple settings and small cast focus all of our attention on the battle of wits a between a scheming husband, played with style by Ray Milland, and the rest of the characters.The story begins when retired tennis pro Tony Wendice (Milland) decides to eliminate his rich, unfaithful wife Margot.  He has laid out an elaborate scheme that starts with blackmailing an old college classmate to do the job for him.  But things do not work out as planned, and Wendice must spend the rest of the film constantly trying to improvise his way out of difficulty.The blackmailing scene at the beginning makes a great prelude to all that follows.  The way that Wendice approaches such a sordid business in such a debonair fashion both initiates all of the plot action and also establishes some nice character contrasts.  (Also watch this scene carefully for one of Hitchcock's most subtle cameo appearances.)The rest of the plot is complicated and contains some fine surprises.  As always, it is handled expertly by Hitchcock, who makes sure that we focus both on the characters and on the clues.  Milland gives a fine performance as Wendice, making us admire his poise and resourcefulness despite his amoral coldness.  Hitchcock favorite John Williams is excellent as the police inspector.The only thing that keeps this from being one of Hitchcock's very best films is the weaknesses in the other two major characters.  As Margot, Grace Kelly is charming as always, but her character makes too many obvious mistakes for us to sympathize with her as deeply as we could.  As Margot's boyfriend, Robert Cummings is too over-eager and one-dimensional for us to like him very much.  These imperfections keep the viewer's emotional involvement from being even stronger, but even so the story is still filled with suspense and interest.""Dial M For Murder"" will bring a lot of satisfaction to mystery and thriller fans as they watch it and try to figure out what will happen next."
"Looks to me as though Hitch was marking time with this pre-digested package until better material came along, which it did with Rear Window (1954). Halfway through this static exercise, however, I started taking notes so I could keep up with all the plot complications. I had to write fast.The trouble is the movie's so full of contrivances and polished British gentility, it had me yearning for Sam Spade and a straightforward slug to the gut. At least that would have interrupted the endless talk and civilized palaver. In fact nothing riles the oh-so, civilized Wendi (Milland), — for example, seduce his wife and he says, ""Okay, have a glass of port""; arrest him for murder, he says, ""Okay, have another glass of port"". I may simplify to make a point, but it's like Hitch is trying to prove something about the British. However, in my book, whatever it is, it's not good.This is one of the few Hollywood movies that films a stage play like a stage play, requiring only a one room set. Couple that inbred space with endless palaver, a tortuous narrative, and 100- minutes of run-time, and you've got one of Hitch's weakest, most oppressive entries. And pity poor Grace Kelly who gets mostly to stand around and look befuddled—probably trying to figure out the latest wrinkle.Now I may not be the brightest bulb on the block, but I'm betting that only the rotund master's name keeps this entry afloat on anyone's list of goodies. Too bad someone didn't save the idea for The Alfred Hitchcock Hour, where the stage play would seem more workable. And to echo the obvious— Please, please, tell me why the cerebral Wendice can't count to three when it comes to latch keys, except, of course, that a locksmith would undo the entire premise."
"Even the perfect crime can have one minor, overlooked detail that leads to the complete unraveling of the entire plan. The random quirks of chance can be the downfall of the cleverest man. That's the plot of Dial M for Murder, in a nutshell.I decided to make this my next Hitchcock film, because that's the kind of story that always seems to interest me. Well, the primary reason was that I'm in love with Grace Kelly, but the plot description was also appealing. Dial M reminded me of Rear Window, in a few ways. Most noticeably, the sparse (yet effective) action, and the use of a single apartment as the major setting for the film. In the hands of a lesser director, those two elements may have been a detriment to the overall quality. But Hitchcock once again works around them marvelously. It's not hard to guess the stage origins of this movie. It actually feels more like a play than a movie.  And while that is in no way a negative, it does mean a lot of exposition. The story is explained to the viewers instead of shown, and because of that I cannot rate Dial M as highly as Psycho, Vertigo, or Rear Window. It's an interesting movie, and it's not hard to find yourself tense during nearly the entire last half. But the execution as a whole could have been better and less expository."
"Dial M for Murder is a superb dialogue driven suspense thriller. Except for a minute or two of footage, all the action takes place in the apartment. The entire cast delivers its lines with conviction and realism. Every successive interaction builds on the suspense generated by the previous one. Ray Milland is so conniving yet sympathetic enough that one almost hopes that he gets away with it. I wonder if Cary Grant, Gregory Peck, or Jimmy Stewart, three of Hitch's most prominent leading men were afraid of jeopardizing their image and thereby their box-office appeal by agreeing to play a villain. Grace Kelly doesn't have much to do here but she does her job admirably. It was a great year for her. I think she made Rear Window and The Country Girl, for which she won a best actress Oscar, the same year she made Dial M. The actors who played the eccentric inspector and the paramour were also top notch casting decisions. Another winner from The Master, 9/10."
"It really takes someone as intellectually alive as Hitchcock to make a stinker as leaden, and dead on arrival as Dial M for Murder. There it sits, lacking any of his signature technique, stagebound and lifeless as when the first word of it was written, not benefiting from any of his intelligence. Characters talk and talk and talk, always indoors, in a drawing room, because it was written for the stage and Hitch couldn't be bothered to open it up. So it's unbearably claustrophobic. Even if you look out a window it's a phony as can be. Ray Milland is dull as dishwater. For a thrill, after what feels like 5 hours, we cut to the insides of a phone interchange.All of it seen through the eyes of normative British police who can't wait to put things right again. ho-hum. I'd suggest more needed to go morally wrong in this snoozer to generate some interest. For a director whose filmic inventions could fill an encyclopedia, this is a tedious, unimaginative project.The only memorable moment in this (which is also grotesque) is when the stooge hired to kill Grace Kelly fails, and falls onto his back, driving a pair of scissors deeper into his body. Hitch regretted this and never did it again. (The knife is never seen injuring Leigh in Psycho). Rent 'Sudden Fear' with Joan Crawford for some actual thrills eked from this same scenario.This should have been called 'Hitchcock Collects a Paycheck,' Dial H for 'Humdrum,' or Dial U for 'Unremarkable.'"
"Suave, debonair Ray Milland wants wife Grace Kelly killed for cheating on him with bland Robert Cummings. He sets it up...and everything goes wrong.The script is pretty obviously from a stage play and most of the movie takes place in one room. Also the ultimate resolution was more than a little silly. Still this is not bad. I saw it in 3-D and 2-D. In 2-D this is slow and dull...3-D actually helps it. The camera is constantly shooting people in the background from behind lamps, couches, chairs etc etc. It adds a great feeling of depth to the surroundings. Hitchcock (wisely) avoided throwing things at the camera--there are only two instances of this: When Kelly is attacked her hand flies up to the camera--it was so real for half a second I almost reached up to help her! Also when someone holds out a key to the camera it comes right out of the screen at you. Hitchcock didn't want the 3-D--he was ordered by studio heads to shoot it that way. Still, he DID manage to use it in an effective way.The acting is almost completely great; Milland is fantastic--very smooth and suave as the villain; Kelly is just visually stunning and also gives out a good performance; John Williams is just terrific as an inspector trying to figure the crime out. Only Robert Cummings is not that good--he's bland and blank-faced the entire time. You really wonder what Kelly ever SAW in him!I like it but I think it drags quite a bit in the second half. I was getting a little bored. Seeing it in 3-D definitely improved the picture. Also it contains one of the most shocking murders in a Hitchcock film--right up there with ""Psycho""!So it's worth a look--try seeing the 3-D version. I give it a 7."
"Based on a stage play, the film's plot takes place mostly in one apartment, a cozy abode complete with a fire burning in the fireplace. An aging tennis pro named Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) plans his wife's murder with the help of an old acquaintance.Wendice is charming, debonair, and intelligent, a man with great foresight who constructs his crime in meticulous detail. Half the fun of this film is watching, and listening to, this guy as he articulates his scheme with confident coolness. Ray Milland is just terrific in the role.Naturally, complications ensue as the film's plot moves along. Not even the scheming Tony Wendice can foresee every possible contingency. And in the second half we get to watch him squirm, mentally struggle, and improvise, as his airtight plan starts to unravel.The Frederick Knott script is heavy on dialogue, but the film is so engaging that it never seems ""talky"". Hitchcock's direction is fine. Color cinematography includes some clever camera angles that help break up the monotony of such an enclosed setting. Yet, the film has a claustrophobic feel that actually enhances the anxiety and tension of the situations the characters find themselves in.Dimitri Tiomkin's elegant score fits well with the formal attire of the characters. The impression is thus conveyed that Tony and his wife are sophisticated, well off financially, and connected to society's upper crust. Grace Kelly and Robert Cummings give fine performances in support roles. And John Williams' performance is as outstanding as that of Ray Milland.This film is not a whodunit. The story is simple and straightforward. It's more of a character study, particularly of Tony Wendice.With a terrific story, engaging characters, excellent acting, clever photography, and credible production design, ""Dial M For Murder"" is thoroughly enjoyable. It is one of my three favorite Alfred Hitchcock films."
"Everyone loves Hitchcock. This one is my favorite. ""Rear Window"" and objectively speaking probably half a dozen others are better but this film is for me. Ray Milland plays a tennis player in the cruel old days when it was not good enough to be good at something. His wife got the money. Grace Kelly did not need much acting talent to play a boring woman but this is not why Ray wants to get rid of her. She falls in love with another man - Ray Cummings of all people. This casting is of course the reason why this film works. We are supposed to sympathize with the greedy husband and at the same time the wife has to be an angel. Very difficult but Hitchcock succeeds. And mainly because we cannot forgive her for even thinking of giving up her husband for a man like him. Still, at the crucial time when she is about to be strangled our sympathies shift to her. We want her to reach the scissors.And then we admire Ray Milland again and hope he will make it. His eyes are the most wonderful thing in the movies. It is a great pity that he played only in a few good ones even after ""Lost Weekend"". This is one of the few thrillers that can be watched over and over again. One drawback of course is that after a while you start thinking about the acting and the great directing and the simple pleasure of watching a good movie shifts to the background. This is true for all great films except for the greatest of them all like GWTW or ""Thief of Bagdad"" that can be watched a hundred times and still be seen like the first time -where you just enjoy the story."
"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** for me, this movie is hitchcock's best. everything is high above average, the cast, the directing, the plot, the screenplay, the cinemathography, the music and the whole movie. movie is abot a man (ray milland) who wants to kill his wife (grace kelly) because of two reasons, one is the money he will inherit and the other is because he discovered that his wife is in love with a novelist writer (robert cummings). milland deviously convince an ex-classmate (anthony dawson) to kill his wife while he is in a party with cummings. but dawson fails to kill kelly and himself is killed by her with scissors. things begin to get rough for milland and then he elaborate a very complex plan to blame his wife for the murder of dawson. the movie goes along with the police investigation and how the inspector (john williams) and cummings begin to suspect of milland.ray milland gives an excellent performance. this is the best performance by grace kelly (second is her role in ""REAR WINDOW""). cumming gives his best role ever (although he is still wooden faced). dawson is outstanding as the forced murderer and john williams is unforgivable as the extremely british chief inspector.hitchcock directed this movie with all his stamina, each shot is a piece of art.  an epic scene is when grace kelly is judged. the stuff about the scissors is very creative and the whole picture is like a very real dream. in this movie you will have to think a lot because the plot is sometimes complicated, but i think this is a good point.""SPOILERS AHEAD""special mention to the reaction that milland has when the police discovered his trick. 10/10."
"SPOILER: There are many who believe that Alfred Hitchcock was a visionary genius; but personally, I fail to see the appeal in his films. I like some 1950s movies - those of Billy Wilder are great, but I find Hitchcock gets stiff performances from his casts, uses preposterous plots and in 'Dial M for Murder', there's a surprising absence of action - just a lot of talk. To summarise the story, a man plans an improbably complex murder; when the plan goes wrong, he frames his wife; but when his wife's friend and a sympathetic policeman get suspicious, they manage to trap him (albeit via the peculiar device of taking her from prison on the eve of her planned execution to help find the evidence to damn him and free her). He takes his capture with sang froid, and the film ends. I suppose Hitchcock was an original, in attempting to tell tales more complex than those previously attempted in cinema; but in an age of over-plotted and under-motivated thrillers, I wonder if his influence can be wholly considered good."
"After all the previous reviews, what can one add? Simply that I adore this film, see it again and again, always with the same delight, never getting tired of it. Curiously, though, it does not seem to me like a typical Hitchcock film... There is not a ""good guy"" fighting some ""bad guys"". The hero is a cold blooded schemer, who wants to murder his wife, but she is not so innocent herself, since she has a secret affair with another man, while her lover comes into their house seemingly as a friend, but is determined to make her leave her husband. There are no action filled scenes, the story is confined within the couple's house, and all is done with the utmost politeness and keeping of appearances. There is no ""murderer"", because the one that commits the actual killing does so in self defense.And yet, we are watching with undiminished interest, to see what will happen next. All the fascination emanates from the ""plan"", the setting, the idea, the master mind that orchestrates the crime scene,like a director does his movie, only his ""actors"" play it differently from what he had arranged. He swiftly opts for an alternative plan, and concludes his ""scenario"" with success, until a police inspector with unorthodox methods finds the loose end, the small detail that leads to the truth... At least 80% of the film's value is due to the performance of Ray Milland, he is pure perfection in his portrayal of the ex champion, the sportsman who organizes his last game, and almost wins the bet... I am very much surprised that he did not get a second academy award for this one, it really shows how unfair the whole system is. It is impossible to point out any favorable scenes, as he is brilliant from the first to the very last moment he is on screen. I especially love, though, the little scene when he hides Margot's handbag behind his back in order to steal her key , while she clings to him, so as to prevent him , both laughing while they struggle... Grace Kelly was very very beautiful in this film, more girlish and sexy than in any of her other roles, not at all like her usual sophisticated and coolly aristocratic self. With Ray Milland they made such a charming couple, that one is almost disappointed that things did not work well for them in the film. If only Tony had a way of knowing that Margot had decided to abandon her ex lover and stay with her husband, the story would have a totally different end! In such a case we would have a romantic film instead of a thriller, but I would surely love such a happy end! Something else that should be said is that Tony would not get the death penalty for what he did, because he did not actually kill anyone, he just PLANNED a murder that did not take place in the end, so he would probably be out after one year or so... I trust that he would be able to make a new life for himself quite easily after that! A film that has no need of any recommendation, its value is well established over the years, but I give mine just the same, as well as 10 points out of ten."
"Ray Milland pulls off another flawless performance as the jealous husband determined to have his cheating young wife Grace Kelly murdered. The aging former tennis star who lives mainly off his wife's wealth. When he learns of her infidelity with an American acquaintance, Milland's adoration for the beautiful Kelly becomes nothing more than a strained pretence, all-the-while planning how he can get rid of her, then live happily ever after off her money.A man Milland barely remembered from college has a few dark secrets, which Milland uses to blackmail him into the meticulously planned ""perfect crime"" of murdering Kelly. A clever (although typical) ""Hitchcock-Twist"" makes for a thrilling change to an unexpected ""Plan B"". Not as well known as similar Hitchcock films, this one is no less of a gem. Although the story and handling, particularly the dull-British ""Scotland Yard"" dialog are definitely from another era, the unfolding plot is sheer Hollywood candy. The final scene is priceless. A sure hit for those who love ""whodunits"" as well as for fans of the Master."
"""Dial M for Murder"" is on of the best pictures that Alfred Hitchcock ever made. From beginning to end it is full of suspense and excitement. Hitchcock has taken a rather ""talky"" play and turned it into a suspense classic. While the screenplay screams to be ""opened up"", Hitchcock does a nice job of making the small one bedroom apartment interesting.Helping him do this is Ray Milland, who is nothing short of brilliant as the jilted cuckold, Tony Wendice, who plots to kill his wife. A former tennis pro, Tony must now live off of the wealth of his cheating wife, marvelously portrayed by the radiantly, beautiful Grace Kelley. Robert Cummings plays the love interest to Kelly. Cummings is pretty bland as Mark Halladay, mystery writer. But then, Halladay is the least interesting character in the play/screenplay. John Williams almost walks off with the picture as Inspector Hubbard.The score by Dimitri Tiomkin is appropriately eerie.But Milland is by far and away the stand-out of this film. Icy, a little creepy, and calculating, this is also, other than ""The Lost Weekend"", his finest performance.In my opinion the only major flaw is the last 12-14 minutes. Too contrived and unrealistic. Although I did like the final moment, where all they want to do is have a civilized drink together.A wonderful performance, wonderful suspenseful direction and score all add up to a truly great film"
"When you watch this movie it's impossible not to feel that Alfred Hitchcock was a genius! Whether it's a thriller like ""North by North west"" where the viewer is taken half-way across America, or an espionage movie that treks across Europe in ""Foreign correspondent"" or just simply a plain case of mistaken identity in the ""The wrong man"", Hitchcock was always able to find the right tempo, atmosphere and chemistry for his films. It's hard to imagine a simple stage play being transformed into a Hollywood box office hit, because with the exception of one or two short scenes, the entire movie takes place in a confined environment of a ground floor flat in Maida Vale London. Not surprisingly Hitchcock does not disappoint and is able to pull it off by producing a highly entertaining film!It is a well written story with great dialog between the characters, but it is the tension, the incidental music and the camera angles that make this movie compelling viewing. Needless to say the movie was blessed with some big box office draws of the day in Grace Kelly, Robert Cummings and Ray Milland, with fine support from Hollywood based Brits character actors Anthony Dawson and John Williams. I'm not suggesting that Dial M for murder is Hitchcocks best movie, the best of course is a subjective viewpoint, but the lead character here Tony Wendice who plays the villain, a washed up former tennis pro is probably Hitchcocks most diabolical killer. I say that because he is not deranged or violent but cold and calculating, he is able to personify evil in an easy-going and matter of fact way. For example not only does he really enjoy blackmailing Swan but takes great pleasure in detailing the way he plans to kill his wife and get away with it. In addition you can see that he is proud of the meticulous planning and ruthless dedication that has gone into this. What's fascinating about the character is that when he gets home and finds Swan dead rather than panic he does some quick thinking, takes advantage of that and is able to stitch up his wife Margot for Swans killing. With his marital woes now behind him (his wife going to the gallows) and the only person who knows other wise unable to talk you can see that he is pretty pleased with himself. Things couldn't have worked out any better for him and he even starts spend the cash he did not have to pay Swan. Even at the very end, a very nonchalant Wendice just casually pores himself a drink as if he had just come in from work. Watching him is like watching water of a ducks back, you'll simply never see Ray Milland in a better role!Robert Cummings plays crime writer Mark Halladay who is Margots lover, and Grace Kelly plays Margot who comes across as mostly bewildered the whole time, even before the attempt on here life. John Williams plays police inspector Hubbard who at first one just dismisses as an eccentric dunce. Initially you underestimate him and wonder if he is in over his head, but as his role becomes more prominent you realize that he is smarter than he looks and is way ahead of Wendice as things unravel. Lot's of twists and turns as you would expect from a Hitchcock movie and despite some obvious legal problems with the crowns case against Margot, it's well worth a watch! (Note: even if the initial crime had been successful and Swan had been able to extricate himself from the flat the police might have been puzzled why there was no wet footprints, grass or mud on the carpet bearing in mind that the garden was wet and that was the way he had meant to have gained access?)"
"""North by Northwest"" is a great example of classic, gripping Hitchcock style -- that movie grabs you by the throat and never lets go! Nowadays I look back at many films from the '50s and '60s and definitely appreciate them, but feel cinematic ally they are much slower and not always as engaging as movies from the '70s, '90s and yes, even the '80s.Hitchcock was a truly great filmmaker, and evidence of this is that nowadays his films are STILL packing a punch and they don't seem outdated in the least! I mean, when was the last time you watched ""Psycho"" and checked your watch? Unfortunately Hitchcock did make a few errors in his resume (namely his last project) and ""Dial M For Murder"" is somewhere in between. It's a good ""talky"" movie in the sense that a bunch of people are in a room acting civilized and sophisticated and upper class (much like ""Rope"" starring James Stewart, also directed by Hitchcock).But the suspense is lacking and the film is not of the same calibre as ""North by Northwest"" or ""Psycho."" It's a good film, and for my money it's better than ""The Birds,"" but don't expect any sort of masterpiece -- otherwise you might feel rather disappointed.(For the record, critics seem to generally consider this Hitchcock's worst movie if only for the reason that it was made during a time when he was very popular and it didn't do very well -- kind of like the 1950s' version of ""1941"" or another flop, people -- primarily critics -- didn't take a real liking to it and it'll probably always be considered his worst mainstream US movie.)"
"Watching it in 2017- a 63 year old film and being mesmerized by the concept, theme, acting, directing, and all the stuff of this brilliantly fabulous movie.All the actors (Ray Milland, Grace Kelly, Robert Cummings, Anthony Dawson, John Williams) were absolute class on their respective characters. I just wish I could go back to those days to have the experience of those beautiful days. Everyone should watch this masterpiece. I know that most of today's viewers prefer movies having nudity or ""f"" words or sexuality, but a true movie lover must watch class films of yesteryear, and this one is certainly one of them."
"Dial M for Murder-***- Must-see- Directed by: Alfred Hitchcock. Written by: Frederick Knott (from his play), Starring: Ray Milland, Grace Kelly, Robert Cummings, John Williams, Anthony Dawson.Perhaps Hitchcock's talkiest thriller deals with a former tennis star (Milland) who hatches a pitch-perfect plan to kill his wife (Kelly). Yet when she kills her hit-man attacker, Milland must go to great lengths to cover his tracks from his wife's lover and an investigator.Frederick Knott adapted his play for the screen, which is perfect fodder for Hitchcock's suspenseful interest in murder and wrong accusations. The marvelous thing about the film is the fact that Hitchcock is able to conceal the fact that the whole movie takes place in virtually one room. The quick and engaging dialogue by Knott and a stellar performance by Milland are the key attributes that hold the film together when it threatens to expose the theatrical approach other than cinema-tics.Hitchcock already reveals the clues to the picture yet we are still fascinated over the course of the investigation because of how effective he is as a storyteller. The talky aspects and the limited cinema-tics of the picture may not appeal to everyone, but Hitchcock still crafts a noteworthy thriller worth discussing and re-watching like most of his pictures."
"It takes place almost entirely in one room, and the dialogue, acting and direction is fantastic throughout.Time has not diminished this gem and it deserves its fame and status."
"I've read that Hitchcock did not think highly of Dial M For Murder, his adaptation of the hit play by Frederick Knotts. Time has shown, however, that the movie is probably better than its filmmaker claims.We might even say that this is what a mystery-thriller should be - not really all that serious, clever, absorbing, still popular (IMDb 8.2). Hitch may be disparaging, but Dial M For Murder is one of the better attempts in the 1950s to translate stage material into cinematic language.Knott's play pits two British intellects against each other -- upper-class gentleman Ray Milland and Scotland Yard Inspector John Williams. There is clever combat here. We are in a lair, full of tricks and treachery. The camera snakes about the expensive London flat, looking for things, taking off-kilter perspectives on the actors, pausing on key objects: sports trophies, heavy green draperies, the handbag, the crucial telephone, and a quite renowned photograph on the wall.As a bonus, Dial M For Murder contains a pivotal - and still startling - ""telephone"" moment of the movies. Grace Kelly answers the pre-arranged phone call from Milland just as murderer Anthony Dawson creeps up behind her with a strangling weapon. Contrary to all expectations, Grace makes adroit use of a pair of scissors.As a further twist, the prestigious society woman becomes a convicted felon herself. This unexpected reversal gives Dial M For Murder a real mid-point surprise. Tension keeps increasing. We know that the story engines are busy devising a way to free Grace from the hangman's noose, but we are never quite sure how this is going to work in the details.The film suffers a bit in the third act. A miscast Robert Cummings interferes in an annoying way. And the culminating trap to expose the villain seems needlessly entangled, with its criss-crossing of trench coats and latch-keys. The inspector, truth be told, turns out to have quite a remarkable skill at guesswork.This was apparently intended for the new 3D camera, but Hitch has never needed 3D, or, for that matter, wide-screen or loud-screen to enhance his effects. They exist in pure cinema. Even with something as stage-bound as Dial M For Murder, he still grips our attention with his clever, sometimes mischievous, devices."
"Ray Milland plays a former tennis star, who has since married a socialite of comfortable means. He finds out she has not been as perfect a wife as she should have been and starts to plan her murder. Unfortunately, murder plots rarely work out as smoothly as they do in detective novels.What a great movie. Almost a closed room mystery where we follow the crime from start to finish, with the added twist of it happening mostly from the point of view of the criminal. The central question not being who's the murderer, but rather how he's going to be caught. Or whether he will be caught or not.The movie has a delightfully British setting, some great actors, some great dialogue and wordplay, and a score that's an interesting mix of usual Hitchcock creepiness mixed in with an almost fairytale-like playfulness.Although, to be fair, I don't like that the viewers are not given all the information needed to solve the mystery. There's a central scene where the plan derails, but the thing that becomes central for the solution is not shown to the viewers. And it's such a small thing that it could have easily been hidden there. Now the viewer can only solve the mystery if they can make the leap from point A directly to point D. Not impossible, but not exactly viewer-friendly either.Still, a very good mystery film and easily one of Hitchcock's best."
"Suspense is the name of the game in 'Dial M For Murder (1954)' and it is dealt out in spades, each scene oozing it to the point where this stage-play adaptation is practically busting at the seams with the anticipatory, string-dangling stuff. While there's a lot of talking and expository dialogue, that's simply because of the single location and the commitment to stick to it - aside from a few asides in a single scene where cutaways are necessary to enhance the plot and, more importantly, the tension - while also just 'shooting the material', as Hitchcock put it, so as not to 'ruin' what was already a captivating and clever source story. 'Just shooting' is to Hitchcock what 'working for a lifetime to achieve a mastery of your craft' is to anybody else, though. Indeed, it is well known that this wasn't one of Hitchcock's favourites and that the studio essentially forced him to do it. He once said, to a room full of journalists, that he could've ""phoned it in."" This was almost certainly said in irony but I don't know what's worse: if it was or if it wasn't. There's no denying that Hitchcock, whatever you think about him personally, was a master of his craft and even this, one that he didn't care for as greatly as something like 'Rear Window (1954)' or 'Vertigo (1958)', is shot to perfection. It really is an astutely directed picture, one in which each frame is set up to make the most of every situation, and every moment truly is as taut and 'edge-of-your-seat' as it could possibly have been. The overall narrative is remarkably unconventional - since it essentially puts a 'villain' in the role of protagonist - and manages to switch our sympathies superbly, sometimes within seconds, so that every character is as empathetic as the last and there is no clear 'hero', as well as no moral compass other than that of our own. Plus, that murder sequence truly is one of the most intense and nail-biting of its kind. 8/10"
"""Dial M for Murder"" is a 1954 crime thriller directed by the legendary Alfred Hitchcock. It was adapted from the play of the same name by Frederick Knott, who also wrote the screenplay for the movie. It stars Ray Milland, Grace Kelly, and Robert Cummings. ""Dial M for Murder"" is about Tony Wendice, played by Ray Milland, a professional tennis player who wants his wife, Margot, played by Grace Kelly, dead. Margot cheats on her husband with Mark Halliday, played by Robert Cummings, an American writer who visits frequently while Tony is away on his tennis tour. Margot says that she destroyed all the letters that were sent to her by Mark, except for one, which was stolen, used as blackmail against her, and was never returned. Once Mark gets home, it is revealed that he intercepted the letter, and that he is the blackmailer, after he insists that Margot and Mark go to the theater. He reveals this by explaining it to his old acquaintance, Charles Swann, played by Anthony Dawson, who he studied with while in college. He then blackmails Swann into killing his wife, so that he may inherit her fortune. He sets up an elaborate plan to do so, but when the plan fails, resulting in Margot accidentally killing Swann, he has to think of a second plan to frame her for murder. It's a thriller divided into two engaging parts, combined with a great story and excellent use of cinematography. The movie's use of cinematography is excellent, using several of Alfred Hitchcock's usual techniques. For instance, the camera tends to sit in one place for extended periods of time, not cutting frequently, as other movies tend to. It makes the movie more realistic when it comes to its acting, which brings up my second point: the acting. The acting is very good in this film, and this is proven by the long takes that were used in the film. They couldn't cut, so the actors had to act for quite a long time compared to other films. It also proves how realistic the characters can be while still having that movie feel. Ray Milland plays his character so well, presenting us with a cocky character who manipulates his enemies until the end, while Grace Kelly gives us a confused character desperate for her life. ""Dial M for Murder"" is a classic film and should be viewed as such. The acting is great, and the use of fewer cuts supports this and gives us a more realistic portrayal of the film's scenario. It's a film that should not be missed by film noir fans or movie buffs. ""Dial M for Murder"" is one of a kind, a true classic."
"Dial M for Murder ""Well, because in stories things usually turn out the way the author wants them to; and in real life they don't... always."" Yes, this murder didn't go quite as expected. In the beginning, the betrayal of Mrs.Wendice(Grace Kelly) gave the audiences a sense of leading turmoil, and Mr.Wendice(Ray Milland)' meeting with a special guest(Anthony Dawson) slowly revealed their conspiracy...""Dial M for Murder"" was a crime drama that directed by Alfred Hitchcock in 1954, starring Grace Kelly, Ray Milland, John Williams, Robert Cummings and John Williams. This film described a tennis player Tony wants to murder his wife to obtain her possession after he found out his wife's affair with Mark Halliday. Tony came up a perfect plan of killing his wife that will create an alibi for himself. When things didn't happen as expected, Tony has trouble to prove his ""innocent"" to the inspector(John Williams) who later arrived the scene.The movie mainly shot in one room, which makes it harder for audiences to focus for a long period. Instead of changing in location, the fast pacing of the story constantly hooked audiences' attention.The acting part was sophisticated which means every expression on their face tells their inner emotion. For example, when Tony's presses his lips together to force a stiff smile, it gives you an idea of untrustworthy.The movie is one of those classic films you will watch over and over again without getting out of interest."
