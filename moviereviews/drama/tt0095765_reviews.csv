Reviews
"It is by now well known that there are two versions of this film that differ greatly, the original 3 hour Italian cut and the heavily re-edited 2 hour version which was the version that charmed the world in 1989. It remains a wonderful experience, but the director's cut is so much richer, deeper, satisfying,well,everything. This review is of the director's cut which may not be the greatest film in the world but is my favourite film of all time ever since I came out of the cinema in which I first saw it in back in 1994 crying my eyes out. Never has a film effected me as emotionally as this one. Cinema Paradiso is many things- a touching story of a friendship, a wonderful portrayal of a Sicilian village, a loving tribute to the cinema, amongst other things, but the longer cut is I believe the most moving and romantic love story ever. For my money, you can forget Casablanca,Dr Zhivago,Titanic,Romeo and Juliet,etc {great as some of them are}, this is the one that does it for me.Divided into three sections, it is the first section that was left almost intact in the short version. It is of course primarily concerned with the relationship between young Toto and the projectionist of his local cinema, Alfredo. It is full of delightful touches,such as Toto stealing a frame of film from behind Alfredo's back, or when Toto helps Alfredo during an exam so he can be allowed into the projection booth, or perhaps best and simplest of all of all Toto's spellbound face as he watches the footage that will be censored by the town priest. The cinema is portrayed as almost being the centre of life in the town Giancaldo in which the film is mostly set. The actual sequences set in the cinema are full of wonderful observation and even some belly laughs. There's the man who only goes to the cinema to sleep and is always awoken by kids, the couple who see each other for the first time because everyone else is cowering from Dr Jekyll And Mr Hyde, the old man who says ""no, this is IMPORTANT"" when everyone else ""booos"" the news-all human life is here, with more observations and insights than in any Mike Leigh film. This section climaxes in a scene which is simply magical, when Alfredo projects a film onto the wall of a house so everyone can see it.As the film moves forward several years to show Toto as a 16 year old, the wonderful cinema scenes are still present. Who can forget the cinema usher telling off a group of young boys for playing with themselves while watching Brigitte Bardot and then sheepishly giving his own manhood a little touch? Director Guiseppe Tornatore also subtly reminds us of changing times, such as when television is first shown in the cinema. However, it is mainly concerned with Toto's {now called Salvatore} courtship of the girl he is in love with, Elena. No one who has experienced the pangs of first love can fail to respond to such scenes as Salvatore ranting on to Elena on the phone how much he loves her and realising he's actually been talking to her mother, or the beautiful first kiss and embrace in the projection booth {of course}.It is in the final section, as Salvatore, now a great film director, returns to Giancaldo as a 50ish man to attend Alfredo's funeral,where the humour all but disappears {well, life gets more serious as one gets older, does it not?} and the pace does slow-be warned. It is possibly the most emotional hour of cinema ever, and was cut to about 15 mins in the short version. Salvatore's reunion with Elena, which also displays absolutely brilliant acting from Jacques Perrin and Brigitte Fossey, is so painful a sequence, as the two characters pour their hearts out to each other. As Ennio Morricone's love theme swells up {a truly heartbreaking piece of music},it ends up being one of the most beautiful love scenes ever filmed. Salvatore's reunion with his mother and his exploration of the cobwebbed, dilapidated, cinema are also extremely moving. As for the final scene, where Salvatore opens a certain gift Alfredo left him-well,there's been too many spoilers already in this review, but suffice to say it is matchless, simply matchless. It was moving in the short cut, but is three times more meaningful in the director's cut.Cinema Paradiso has been called sentimental, but in the director's cut it is a darker, deeper kind of sentimentality. Maybe it is still ""a love letter to the cinema"", but it is also shows that obsessive love of something such as films can also result in sadness and regret. Think of what happens to Alfredo in the film, and as for Salvatore, well, his curse is that he has two loves in his life but success in one of them comes at the expense of the other. The uncut Cinema Paradiso is more then anything else about life and the effect of the decisions we make. O, and the greatest, most heartbreaking love story ever {have I already said this!}"
"Whether you are a professional or an amateur it is always wise to avoid superlatives with regard to a movie critique ... but I cannot. 'Cinema Paradiso' is simply the finest movie I have ever seen. Like many who have posted at this site before me I have seen it many many times. It reaches within me to places other movies have never reached and I have often wondered why. Perhaps it is because of it's simplicity. It contains no expensive special effects, it has no gratuitous sex or violence, it has no ""multi-millon dollar per performance"" actors that I know of, it is arguable whether it even has a story line, and yet it soars far above the nonsense that film makers are producing these days. It's characters are portrayed by each and every actor in award winning style and the music is not only beautiful but absolutely perfect for this film.It is quite simply the story of a human life and it's tragedies and triumphs within the context of a vocation. A young boy matures and gradually learns the lessons of life, cultivates his passion for the cinema, and is rewarded with professional success; however, he remains unfulfilled for true love has escaped him only to return in the form of a gift of love which transcends time, space, and death to reveal at the closing of the film Toto's one true mistress.A staggering triumph of both the cinematic art and of story telling and yet there may be found people who do not like this movie .... I tend to keep such people at arms length and  maintain a wary eye fixed upon them at all times."
"I seldom watch Italian movies, (i saw it today for the first time) being Italian maybe i'm biased, but this one really stands out. A real masterpiece; i can't remember another movie so moving like this one, maybe Schindler's list; it makes you laugh and it makes you cry, yet it is so simple and straightforward. Maybe there lies its magic: no Hollywood superstars, no special effects, just pure emotions and feelings, love, fear, grief and regret, nostalgia for childhood and youth, memories of places and times that will not come back, memories of the loved ones. Some movies are there to entertain, some to scare, some to question. This movie is there to affect your feelings. Definitely to be seen."
"Movies can wield a strange power over those who sit in the darkened seats of a theatre.  The truly great ones manipulate your perception of reality, suspend your disbelief, and ultimately either alter or affirm your view on life.  NUOVO CINEMA PARADISO is just such a movie.  It is the near-perfect melding of direction, acting, script, sound track, and cinematography. Phillipe Noiret and Salvatore Cascio give the kind of performances usually associated with much more recognizable actors.  The supporting cast looks like they could all be full-blooded Sicilians.  The location shots add depth and realism to the entire production.  Ennio Morricone's music is simply the most appropriate and emotive I have ever had the pleasure to hear in a theatre.  Tornatore's script and direction are a joy, a breath of fresh air.I will not spoil this story by repeating it, nor will I give away the ending, although it matters not a whit.  I could disclose fully everything in this movie, and in seeing it, all my words would evaporate.  There is nothing like the experience of sitting through it, becoming engulfed by it, and in the end, being changed."
"I continue to be moved and deeply touched by this beautiful film from Italy, and I never tire of watching it. I share the lives of Toto and Alfredo, the small Sicilian boy, who loses his father in the second world war, and the older man who runs the projector at the local cinema. Toto lives in a world of make believe, movies, adventure. His dreams take him away from the small Sicilian village where he lives with his mother and sister. Alfredo becomes for him a surrogate father, and the movies, his paralell existence. It is a deceptively simple film, which sweeps you up and carries you along. You never want it to end. And, when it does end, it is with such heartbreaking simplicity, I cannot help being moved to tears. Young Salvatore Cascio is a marvel as the small Toto, a mischievous, impish, adorable child. Phillipe Noiret is unforgettable as the sly and heart-warming Alfredo. You grow up with Toto, until he becomes a famous film director in Rome, and returns to the small village after many years for Alfredo's funeral. It is the story of life, lost love, devotion, friendship, and family. It is unforgettable."
"I have seen this film at least a dozen times and each time I am carried away to a small village in Italy, where the dreams of a small boy come true and we can join his spellbinding journey.  The Italian language (it is subtitled) adds to the film's beauty and music, the characters are so real you can almost smell them.  I am absorbed into ""Paradiso"" each time I watch it, so that when it is over, I am shocked into the realisation that I haven't actually been anywhere except right there, in my theatre seat. I am not a huge ""art house"" film fan or indeed enjoy subtitled films (it is hard on the old eyes!) but ""Paradiso"" is a gem and is worth seeing again and again."
"Cinema Paradiso is a profoundly important movie because it deals with identifiable emotions/issues that could be considered universal on so many levels. The entire story is retrospective similar to Fellini's style as well as a love story that pulls in the viewer on an emotional level. The film also attempts to expose an inkling of Sicilian life, language,(different from Italian) and how ""history"" has intruded upon and shaped the mentality of the Sicilian people; to also show that traditional concepts of what is ""moral"" or right is not to be taken for granted because of the people and their particular history. For those who do not fancy history or non-fiction, the film attempts to educate the ""outsider"" not familiar with Sicilian history as it pertains to the WWII era. I watch it again and again and see more and more details that pertain to the story. I did see it on the big screen at a local theater back in 1991 and it was a hit with the audience. I have several scenerio that I think could make it more interesting and am very curious about the uncut version and what is different about it. Finally, the movie does make me cry because it is after all a love story and it is clear at the end that Toto (aka Salvatore)is still in love with Elena and that is why he never married or settled down ""..to love one person. . . "" as his mother says to him after his 30 year absence from home. The final scene of the credits also shows him looking at Elena again and the look on his face is telling. This film has many little ""hints"" that serve to inform the viewer and give just a little more info. about the story. Truly, one of the best films I have ever seen !!! These characters come alive and we feel like we know them--personally. Viva Giuseppe Tornatore for his masterpiece!"
"This 1988 Italian film (released in the US in 1990), is back with a full 51 minutes added on. This seemed like a stupid idea...there was nothing wrong with the original. The directors cut (which was 1/2 hour longer) was considered a mess. Also, for this release, an extra 1/2 hour was added! I expected the worse. Well, I was pleasantly surprised that this 3 hour version is better than the 2 hour one.This story follows the life of Salvatore. He's born in a tiny Italian village and we see him as a little boy in the 1930s, an adolescent in the 40s-50s and an adult in the 80s. It basically is about his love of movies and the one true love of his life--Elena. They are in love but she comes from a rich family and he lives in poverty. How can they be together?POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILER IN NEXT PARAGRAPH!!!!The cut movie in the US excised a lot of the Elena subplot and concentrated on Salvatore's love of movies. There's nothing wrong with that, but Elena disappears quite suddenly. This full version explains what happened between them and fleshes out the characters more. It also reveals a crucial surprise at the end.The performances are all fantastic--especially by the gorgeous young actor playing Salvatore as a teenager. Elena is also stunning. The film has beautiful cinematography and a haunting music score. The 3 hours flew by for me. I didn't want it to end! So...beautiful music, attractive stars, good acting, compelling story and some incredible romantic sequences. A must-see!!!!Bring plenty of Kleenex though--I cried a least 5 times!"
"After seeing this special edition DVD which shows the entire 174-minute film (in addition to the 121-minute one that most of us had seen over the years,) my rating of this film was elevated. This review is of the longer ""director's cut.""Most of the new footage involved the main's character's romance while he was a young man. The story then is continued years later when that character comes back to his hometown for a funeral and runs into the woman he was in love with but never was able to get for his own. It turns out to be a somewhat tragic love story.The first part of the film, with Salvatore Cascio as ""Toto"" a young boy is a love story about two people sharing their love of movies: the kid and an adult ""Alfredo"" (Phillpe Noiret) who runs the local movie theater. Their love of film bonds them for life.The word ""love"" is used repeatedly in this review because that's the dominant theme: the love people had for others and for the world of film, something all of us on this website share.The second and third parts of the film are the above-mentioned love story of Toto (Marco Leonardi as an adolescent and then Jacques Perrin as an adult) and ""Elena"" (Agnese Nano/ Brigitte Fossey). The first third of this director;s cut edition is much livelier and interesting, frankly, than the last two-thirds. Although not boring, it does drag in a few spots but the longer version is better in the long run because it makes the whole story much more meaningful.It's very nicely filmed and you get a real feel for the Italian people and their little town. The director of the movie, Giuseppe Tornatore, went on to make other great visual films, two of which I also like: Malena and The Star Maker.....but Cinema Paradiso, I believe, is considered his ""masterpiece."""
"Giuseppe Tornatore's Nuovo cinema Paradiso (Cinema Paradiso) is everything good about the movies. It is a story about love. The love between a Father and Son, an Individual and his home, and the love for the movies. Even if this is not your favorite film, if you are a filmmaker, you have no choice but to say this is your all time favorite film (if not one of the greatest films ever made). If only for the movie's ending, this is a great film. The ending answers all of your questions and completes the story. The missing love from a Man's life. The missing pieces to all the stories (movies) found and made into a whole. The final message from beyond the grave, the ending is perfect. If the musical score doesn't put you in tears, the amazing visuals will push you over the edge. This is what all movies should be about. Terrific."
"This movie is very sentimental, so if you are proud of your cynical side, stay away. If you are scared of foreign movies and start foaming at the mouth at a subtitle, stay away.For the rest of us, this is a masterpiece!  Enjoy the movie and enjoy yourself!  The end is so beautiful that it is almost unbelievable."
"This movie definitely is one of my all time best movies. Director Giuseppe Tornatore placed himself in the list of the best directors. The usage of an excellent background score is a trademark of his movies and this movie is not at all a different case.He is also a master in getting best performances out of children and adolescents. Marco Leonardi was the pick of the whole cast. Also watch Melena for those trademarks of Tornatore.The character of Alfredo is one of the most unforgettable characters. The way emotions captured in a camera is way beyond naturality.Overall, this is a great movie with ultimate teamwork with everyone contributing. I just loved the movie very much."
"Colorful and moving flick dealing with a wonderful friendship between a little boy and a solitary projectionist . However , being overly nostalgic , too sentimental and overwhelmingly sweet . Attractive and sensitive picture with stirring drama , ravishing cinematography and enjoyable musical score . A filmmaker (Jacques Perrin , he subsequently became a notorious director) recalls his childhood (Salvatore Cascio , Toto , who celebrated his eighth birthday during filming) , when he fell in love with the movies at his village's theater and formed a deep friendship with the theater's projectionist (Philippe Noiret who said all his lines in French) at Cinema Paradise . The director goes back home to his Sicilian village for the first time after almost 30 years and is reminded of his first love (Antonella Attili) . It is an interesting celebration of youth, friendship, and the everlasting magic of the films . Nostalgic and sensitive picture with thought-provoking drama , ravishing cinematography and moving musical score . The picture contains drama and nostalgia completely wrapped in an agreeable story between a lone man and a boy . The flick relies heavily on the relationship between an older man and a kid , subsequently teenager , but this does not get bored or spoils the tale . Slightly overrated but excellent all the same time , the picture is enjoyable and entertaining , but overlong . The story is narrated with great sense and sensibility , the intelligent screenplay was written by the same Giuseppe Tornatore . Giuseppe's intention was that this movie should serve as an obituary for traditional movie theatres and the movie industry in general , after the movie's success he never mentioned this again. This excellent and enthralling picture ¨Cinema Paradise¨ was starred by extraordinary actors such as Philippe Noiret , Jacques Perrin and Marco Leonardi . Good acting from remaining cast , just like Antonella Attili , Enzo Cannavale , Leopoldo Triestre , Agnese Nano , Pupella Maggio, among others . Glowing cinematography with scenarios colorfully and stunningly photographed by Blasco Giurato who reflects splendidly the cinema , streets , square , village and many other things . Rousing as well as insistent score musical , including a continuous leitmotif from the beginning to the end ; being efficiently composed by the veteran master and prolific Ennio Morricone . The film won several nominations and awards , Oscar included .This weeper picture was very well directed by Giuseppe Tornatore . He is a writer and director, known for making similar nostalgic films including good actors , such as ¨Malena¨ with Monica Belucci , ¨ The star maker¨ with Sergio Castellito , ¨Baaria¨ with Raoul Bova ; and ¨La Leggenda del Pianista Sull'Oceano"" (original title) or ""The Legend of 1900"" or ""The Legend of the Pianist on the Ocean with Tim Roth . Being his English-language debut feature titled ¨The professor¨ with Ben Gazzara . Cinema Paradise Rating : Better than average, well worth watching for exceptional cinematography , first-rate acting and marvelous score ."
"Spoiler warning for anyone who hasn't seen this classic yet...ok? Don't read this review if you haven't seen at least one version of Cinema Paradiso.First of all, I was born in Italy, so I was extremely proud when Cinema Paradiso won the Oscar for best foreign film as well as the hearts of all movie goers when it was released. Also, I am a hopeless romantic who absolutely adores movies! So this movie was right up my alley on many levels!I saw the shorter version as most of us did when it came out in the US, and only recently saw the full uncut Director's version.  It is one of my all-time favorite movies ever--and still is--but I must admit that I did not experience near the same magic or euphoria that the shorter original version gave me many moons ago! Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the extra 51 minutes because I wanted MORE of a great thing, but as the old saying goes, sometimes less is more! Nothing, I repeat, nothing can match the power of the imagination and thus there in lies the magic and the power of the shorter version! By cutting out the extra scenes, we, the audience, were all left up to our own devices and forced to fill in the blanks ourselves with our imagination and our heart! By seeing everything the way we do in the full blown version, well, despite how sweet it was, it left something to be desired. I enjoyed the reunion (al though the whole flashing light effect grew VERY tiresome after awhile) but I could have done without it.Also, the thing that has been eating away at me is the whole question about why in the world Alfredo would (or could!) interfere with his supposed adopted son's first true love! Sure, I've been trying to come up with angles and reasons for his insanely cruel action, but nothing will convince me that the writer/director simply screwed up and should not have made the character do such a dastardly deed! Period! I loved the whole notion that he loved his ""son"" so much that he forced him to leave town and made him promise never to come back again...because we all knew that Alfredo was right...the only way Toto was going to achieve his dream was by leaving their small town and son of a gun if Fredo wasn't right! However....for him to be the main reason for the breakup of Toto's great love spoils the whole story. I will never watch this version again. I bought the DVD and pray that the original shorter verson that I saw and fell in love with is on the DVD!!!P.S. Some of my all-time favorite scenes come from this movie: The kiss in the rain (which is the cover on the DVD!) The dialogue where Alfredo tells Toto ""I don't want to hear you talk anymore. I want to hear people talking about you!"" The montague at the end of all the kisses and censored scenes. The haunting images of Elena on Toto's little movie projector..."
"I just saw the director's cut after an hiatus of about 10 years since the last time I saw the shorter version of the Cinema Paraiso. The difference between the two versions does not take away from the immeasurable quality and sublime way of telling a story of either film. The director's cut does change the focus from the prominence of the love of Alfredo for Toto (Salvatore) in the shorter version to the love between Salvatore and Elena in the longer version. The shorter and longer versions are like watching two movies for the price of one.The subtle change of extended story line between the two versions should be studied by all film students who want to take up editing as a career. It is amazing how the absence of some material and the addition of others can develop to such equally impressive but different conclusions. In the first film the closure of Elena's role turns out to be final. In the second and longer version the doors are reopened slightly and maybe, just maybe, they may reunite and dispel some of Salvatore's lonely existence later on in his life. The shorter version is certainly more of a devised film (in a very good way). Gaps are left for us to fill in with our own interpretations of what could or could not have been. This is true of all art where the author of the work leaves us some space to imagine our own input or contribution to the film. The second film is more cathartic than the first, or more expositional  letting us identify more with the elements of the story than invent them where we seek explanations. Case in point, again, the relationship with Elena: we imagine that she disappears and marries, under her father's orders, to some miserable ""banking"" husband and is lost to the bliss she could have had with Salvatore (at least, that is my invention of what could have happened to her). In the second version she seeks Salvatore so much she marries the next best thing she can find: Boccia  the closest person she can get that approximates him, especially after he has disappeared to Rome.Phew, that the two versions can become two different movies at the same time and still leave me weeping. Wow! I don't even want to start on the excellent photography, the music score, the subtlety of the story telling and the tremendously gifted cast. I kneel and then prostrate humbly before the makers of this most exquisite work of art."
"Spoilers herein.Although this film has been universally praised in both its short and long versions, I must lodge a converse opinion. And express concern about a viewing public who would so applaud.This film was conceived with an intelligent framework, indeed one that I'm disposed to like regardless of the quality of execution. This is a film about films, but instead of the usual star and filmmaker end, it focuses on the effect on the viewer. It further merges one element of film -- visible passion in the kiss -- with the `real' life story depicted. More: it is set in Sicily where we can exploit dry villages and warm North African faces.But then it squanders all this wonderful foundation and expends all of its energy on mere sweetness. My gosh, we have the cute imp, who drags his mentor from a burning building! We have that wise man, now blind imparting the mysteries of life. As long as we stuck to the little boy, the charm was tolerable, but it went on and on and on like a triple load of cotton candy. Yes, there is some charm. Yes, there are a few lovely shots (including fireworks). Yes, some of the characters are endearing.
But the director treats us like his portrayed villagers: as long as there is something on the screen, we in our simple lives are supposed to be mesmerized.This is the worst sort of film, one that soothes with palliative images and a romantic otherworldiness. If film for you is all about a pleasant escape, this is your movie. If film is instead a means for expanding your world and exploring ideas, stay away. This is Hallmark emptiness, and almost any other Italian (besides Benigni) will do better.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements."
"I am going to start this by warning anyone who has yet to see the director's cut of Cinema Paradiso: DO NOT WATCH THE DIRECTOR'S CUT!!!  I know everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but I am saying this because I viewed both versions of Cinema Paradiso in my film class (123 min. version first, followed by the 170 min. director's cut), and with the exception of one person, everyone in the class wished that they had not seen it.  At the very least, if you must watch the director's cut, I urge you, no, I implore you, to make sure you watch the 123 min version first.  If you watch the 170 min version first, you are robbing yourself of a great experience you will never be able to reclaim; watching the 170 min version first WILL ruin the 123 min version.After we first viewed the 123 min version, there wasn't a single person in my class that wasn't amazed by what they had just seen.  It is an amazing story of the magic of film and the cinema, highlighted by great performances and some of the most beautiful cinematography I have ever seen.  There are very few films that I consider to be near-perfect, but the 123 min version of Cinema Paradiso has made that list.  Some people complain that the 123 min version leaves a lot unanswered, but the beauty of it is that it doesn't matter.  Though love and Toto's relationship with Elena are involved, they aren't the focus of the 123 min version.  The focus of that version is on the relationship between Alfredo and Toto, and their shared love and enchantment with the cinema and film.It is a powerfully emotional film, but, sadly, this level of emotion is lost in the director's cut.  In attempting to clean up any loose ends or unanswered questions, the film is considerably bogged down by details and the magic and emotion of the 123 min version is lost.  The focus of the entire story is shifted, and rather than solely being the story of the relationship between Toto and Alfredo, the film takes on the extra task of juggling the story of the relationship between Toto and Elena as well.  In doing so, both storylines suffer, and the power the 123 min version holds is greatly reduced.  The result is a complicated mess of answers (many of which only raise more questions), that after seeing leave you wishing you hadn't. In the end you crave for that initial sense of magic and emotion the 123 min version provided to come back, but for some it is all too late.  I know it's tempting to watch the director's cut, but this is one occasion where you shouldn't indulge your curiosity.  Sadly, the 170 min director's cut version taints the beauty and magic of the 123 min version of Cinema Paradiso, and that is one treasure that should never be lost."
"Don't approach the movie with your logic part of the brain switched on.Yes, as someone said there are some flaws relative to how realistic it can be, but that doesn't matter because you'd be missing the point.Just let yourself go and enjoy this celebration of cinema, dream and emotions and this piece of art will bring you on a lovely spiritual trip.I loved it.P.S.: Sorry IMDb, but I was able to say everything I wanted to say without the mandatory 10 lines of text. I really love your website but you should pass this message to the management: quantity doesn't make quality."
"This film is a beautiful cinematic poem.I´ll never understand why this movie in the States is considered an Art House movie. Almost for intellectuals. Why ? Because it is not in English? This couldn´t have been a more comercial normal movie if it really tried to be one in the first place. People who say this is an ART movie, definitely never watched one in their lives. Because they can be awful to watch sometimes. But there are good things too. Anyway...Unfortunely, I bet many people didn´t went to see it because of this classification. You don´t know what you´re missing !CINEMA PARADISO, is, ( along with THE BIG BLUE ), my all time favorite movie ever, ( I can never choose between them ). It has the most beautiful story I´ve seen in a movie so far.
Many people don´t like it, but I can bet those people don´t truly love cinema. They´re just ordinary movie goers who consume movies as fast food. Anyone who loves Cinema has to love CINEMA PARADISO !I used to think that italian movies were only those junk crapPseudo-erotic "" PORKYS "" style comedies or else those Art Films that the very intelligent Elite of film critics pretend to like, and so I only went to see CINEMA PARADISO, a few months after his release, because I was thinking that this would be one more of those.I was wrong. This is the most beautifuly filmed love story ever, on par only with CASABLANCA although in a very diferent style. It´s amazing how this movie by telling a love story and a life of a character in fact tells about the history of cinema itself. The use of the theater location as a conection between characters through out the years is magnificently done.And it has probably the most beautiful soundtrack ever !Very emotive and capturing perfectly the story in all its moments.And it has the most beautiful and moving ending ever filmed! No matter how many times we see this film. I bet everybody drops a tear at the end. And more than a tear, I´m sure. I do.This is one of those rare moments in modern cinema that can´t be described. It has to be felt.This movie is a true MASTERPIECE ! Please go and see it. It realy deserves not to be ignored.Do yourselves a favor and go see it.You´ll never forget it. Believe me. It´s that good."
"Since ""Cinema Paradiso"" is billed as a joyful celebration of movies for all of us who love them, I am sorry to say that its charms were lost on me. Its story of young Salvatore ""Toto"" who discovers the magic of the movies through his friendship with projectionist Alfredo (Philippe Noiret) has potential, but too often falls prey to false sentimentality, muddled storytelling, and unbelievable characters. It got to the point where I thought that the remote Sicilian village wasn't even a real location, but rather a soundstage set (the piazza seems too big and tidy).I watched the 122-minute version, not the 170-minute director's cut, but I still felt that ""Cinema Paradiso"" was too long, padded with innumerable ""local color"" scenes. The townspeoplewho are all stock comic characters, including a village idiotsit in the movie theater and react quirkily to the film they're watching. Presumably, this is meant to show how important the cinema is for them, bringing glamour and romance into their difficult lives. But since you never get a sense of what these people are individually like outside the movie theater, the contrast between real life and reel life isn't deeply felt.Toto is not a very sympathetic character in any of his three incarnations. At first, he is an annoyingly impish, prank-pulling little boy; then a lovesick and wildly impractical teenager; then a successful middle-aged film director who seems to have no inner life whatsoever. (Evidently, the middle-aged Toto is more developed in the director's cut, but I don't know if I have the patience to sit through that one!) The movie's attempt at heart-tugging romance falls flat because Toto's love interest Elena is so poorly characterized--all actress Agnese Nano has to do is stand there and look pretty. Noiret is good, though, moving beyond the cliché of the ""crusty but lovable mentor"" to reveal Alfredo's deep bitterness and determination that Toto not make the same mistakes he did. The famous ending montage of all the screen kisses that a conservative priest had censored is a lovely celebration of old Hollywood, but nothing that you can't find in the Academy Awards tribute montages every year. It also requires a major suspension of disbelief weren't all these prints lost when the movie theater burned down? The best scene in ""Cinema Paradiso,"" coming closest to conveying just what's so special about the movies, is when Alfredo turns his movie projector to face the window and screens a film on the outside of a building. The beam of silver light shoots through the empty black air; for an instant, all is magical, illuminated, even incendiary. Unfortunately, instead of creating many more new and wondrous moments like this one, ""Cinema Paradiso"" mostly falls back on old plot devices and one-dimensional characters."
"This film is exquisitely poignant. Giuseppe Tornatore expresses his overpowering love of movies by giving his viewers a genuinely magnificent movie to love and treasure. The final scene is a perfect blend of film editing and soundtrack music. Anyone whose eyes are still dry half way into that glorious scene needs to see a cardiologist ASAP. Cudos to the great Ennio Morricone & son Andrea. Many reviewers insist that the shorter, theatrical-release version is superior to the director's cut. The full-length version makes a central character morally ambiguous, in contrast to the uniformly benevolent father figure depicted in the shorter version. In the long version this character commits an act similar to but far crueler than the behavior of another character who is ridiculed early on. Most new viewers will watch the full-length film. The shorter version is more satisfying for those who secretly prefer fairy tales in which the good guys & bad guys are consistently good guys & bad guys. Viewers who can handle a realistic dose of moral ambiguity owe it to themselves to see the real reel."
"It is my favorite movie of all time. It's so beautiful in so many ways, and the ending is fantastic and will make you cry for sure :)."
"This Italian motion picture achieved notorious fame, comparable to the equally famous and more recent Italian movie 'La Vita è Bella'.Like that one, this one is also very good in its first half, but after that it becomes a movie of bad taste. That's really too bad, because this movie (and 'La Vita à Bella') had potential to be something big.'Nuovo Cinema Paradiso' can be considered a homage both to cinema and films. It shows us the pinnacle of the cinema as an industry of entertainment and as an escape for those who go there to watch the movies, making them forget the hard reality of poverty and war. Besides the cinema's success, it also shows its progress, its bankrupt, its decadence and its sad ending.This is a very simple film. However, simplicity doesn't necessary mean something bad. Plus, the brilliant and memorable soundtrack by Ennio Morricone adds lots of emotion to the film, particularly in its first half, which is without a doubt the best part of the movie.One of the biggest charms of this movie is the fascination and enthusiasm of Salvatore (whose nickname is ""Toto"") on the cinema and the projectionist job. He wins the friendship of the local projectionist, Alfredo, who also teaches him all about that job. As you can tell, ""Toto"" is a very intelligent kid and a very quick learner. Plus, he is mischievous, cute and hilarious.Of course, even the first half has its minor faults, such as the pranks of bad taste - for example, that pig who spits to the audience and the prank with a bug on the sleepy guy. Pranks aside, I also don't like at times the behavior of Salvatore's mother: she slaps him a number of times.As for the good of the first half, well, just about most of it. And this without forgetting Salvatore's dumb classmate. He's a poor dumb kid who doesn't know what 5x5 is. Whenever he answers that question is hilarious, as each answer is dumber than the previous one. In the 3rd time, he goes as far as replying «Natale!» (which is ""Christmas"" in Italian) - when he said that, I practically died of laughter!As for the 2nd half of the movie, most of it is wrong and seems quite rushed and forced. Salvatore is no longer charming as a grown up. The love story between Salvatore and the girl of his dreams is frustrating in all ways, not to mention that it's ridiculous that Salvatore spends entire months waiting for her to open the window as a sign that she fell in love for him. There is no comedy or charm as in the 1st half. An animal is stabbed. Salvatore joins the army. And Alfredo's attitude later is puzzling: forcing Salvatore to leave that town forever, never look back, never return (not even to visit, going as far as saying that if he returns he won't receive him in his house), never let nostalgia hit him and never to even write or think about them.I clearly prefer ""Toto"" as a child than as a teen or as an adult. ""Toto"" is far more charming as a child. In fact, the moment he grows up, for some reason the movie looses its initial greatness.Phillipe Noiret gives a great performance as Alfredo, but little Salvatore Cascio steals the show as little ""Toto"".I never saw the Director's Cut version. And frankly, I've got no interest in watching it. It's about 30 minutes longer, making it a too long movie and it certainly makes one view the film differently, as many of the mysteries are revealed (which might not be a very good idea). I saw the shorter version which isn't even that short, as it is nearly 2 hours long. But I can handle a movie of 2 hours."
"Philippe Noiret's death yesterday brings to mind all his movies, including ""Nuovo cinema Paradiso"". The first time that I saw this was right after I had seen ""The Postman"", and I recognized him as the man who had played Pablo Neruda. Here, he plays an equally great role, of the operator of a camera in a movie theater in an Italian village in years past. His friendship with and advice to young Salvatore proves to be more than the boy could have ever dreamed about. In a sense, the movie seems to be a look not only at what Italy was, but also what going to the movies was. It's definitely a masterpiece that I recommend. There may be the issue of whether or not we should make Italy's past look so idealistic, given that Mussolini was in power at the time. But I would assert that this movie shows that even in times of oppression, people can find ways to escape it. A really good movie."
"I first saw this movie back in 1988 in Italy, when it came out there. Back here in the States, I must have seen it several dozen times, in theaters and on VHS tape. It is not a ""feel good movie"" - thank God - but it always overwhelmed me emotionally.I saw it again tonight on TCM, for the first time in 20-some years, and found that I still remembered many of the lines. I almost always knew what was coming next, what would be said next.And I found that I still find it profoundly moving. It is the story of a man who grows up in love with two people, the projectionist at the movie theater in his small Sicilian town, and later, a beautiful young woman who arrives for a few years in his town and then leaves. Both, in different ways, leave him searching for love in a very idealized form, a form that he cannot, for obvious reasons, find in his adult life. And so he goes from one empty relationship to another, all the while making what are evidently very successful movies, though we never find out what they are about. When he comes back to his small town, after having been away many years, he sees how small-town life in rural Italy has changed. But he does not really seem to learn how his fascination with romantic movies has impeded his own emotional development.That sounds very dour, which this movie is not. It is, in fact, a warm-hearted and wonderful film about life in small-town Italy after World War II. I cannot recommend it too highly. It is one of the most profoundly moving films I have ever had the pleasure of seeing.A note: the 124-minute version shown on TCM tonight, which is the version I saw many times here in the States in theaters and on VHS, is substantially shorter than the original Italian version, which was at one point released in this country as the ""director's cut."" I haven't seen that in years, but as I recall, it made certain scenes in the movie more understandable. It's worth searching out, as I recall, but I will admit that I found parts of it too slow."
"I just saw the new Cinema Paradiso this weekend, which also marks the first time I ever saw it. It's a long film but you don't notice the time passing as you watch, since it speaks on many different levels of terms of life, memory and experience.The film has several storylines, reflecting different comments. A film about a first love, about a mentor and a student, about films or about not being able to go home again. However, to select a single one of these as the main story would miss the overall experience, since they are parts of an overall tapestry about the tough choices life presents.The standard hollywood treatment would made a completely happy ending, our hero gets together with the girl (now woman) of his heart; continues his successful movie career; his mentor remains flawless, and somehow restores the old town's spiritual heart. This doesn't happen, for as his mentor states ""life is much harder than in the movies"".Not to say that this a sad film, it's an extremely happy one, and by being tough and presenting a more truthful aspect of experience, its exquisite moments are that much more joyous."
"I should have known to stay away from this movie when it was recommended to me by someone who wouldn't normally be caught dead watching a foreign language film. The best way to describe the kind of movie we're dealing with here is to say that if you liked ""Life Is Beautiful"" you will like ""Cinema Paradiso."" People who don't like foreign movies like this one because, if you take away the Italian subtitles, this film is as fake and schlocky as the worst piece of sentimental clap-trap churned out by the Hollywood myth-making machine. Not one single moment of this movie rang true for me. Subtlety was passed over on every occasion for the the most manipulative of cinematic tricks, and the love story that anchors the film is boring and completely missing any sort of sexual spark.I have a feeling that this movie is so beloved because people who in reality have pretty low-brow movie tastes can watch it and feel like they're cinematically smarter. A double feature of this and ""Life Is Beautiful"" might just be enough to make me lose hope in serious film forever.Grade: D"
"well i really wanted to like this movie, and i was ready for a treat. but unfortunately, it never came. movie starts promising, base for the story is laid down wide, and it looks like it will grow into a masterpiece. but it doesn't. phillipe noiret deserves recommendations for his role of alfredo and young salvatore cascio is nothing short of a brilliant in his role of salvatore as a child. other than that, everything is mediocre at best. story, while full of potential, is presented in an utterly corny and clichéd manner, acting is (besides those two honorable exceptions) amateurish and overplayed, and plot is (as expected) non-existent. filmed 4 years after ""once upon a time in America"", this flick at the moments resonates the great masterpiece, and i kinda expected old salvatore to look through projection booth while recalling his childhood :)while i can always swallow eternal-love type of story, this one is too shallow, too unfocused and watered. i haven't missed any of the movies messages, they are just too obvious and pathetic, and could appeal to me only if i was 18 again. for a 1988 movie that pretend to be something more, i find that inexcusable. there a tons of beautiful films, much older than this, dealing with same subjects in much more profound and original manner. this one settles with portraying love for art with endless clips of old movies, and shots of people watching them. for most passionate lovers of cinema and celluloid magic this might be a great movie as they can find their favorites in every clip featured. i personally don't like cinema as a whole nor it's ""magic"" nor do i respect every ""classic"". what i do like are good stories told in a good way, whether spoken, written or made into movies. and i don't like the way this one is told so i would probably give it 2 stars if there wasn't for legendary morricone that can singlehandedly elevate experience of every movie with the simplest of his tunes. watch and forget."
"I appreciate what this this film was trying to do, but I think it's entirely to big, clumsy, and sloppy to be of any real value.  I actually sat through this monster twice and I can say that it doesn't even get any better the second time.The theme of the movie (that is, maturing and allowing yourself to move on with your life, as opposed to the pretty picture movies portray) is admirable and comprehensible.  However, there are some major problems that overwhelm this strength.  First, the film is entirely too long.  It feels like the director just tossed in every single ""growing up"" cliché he could think of and the result is that the movie takes up waaaay too much of your life.  Second, in spite of the first problem, this film has huge story gaps that took place as a result of massive editing (as I understand it, this film was originally well over three hours).  Third, the film makes no real attempt to establish empathy with the audience.  It instead makes the erroneous assumption that we will just see Alfred and Toto and be instantly smitten with these lovable characters.  Wrong again.  I too often found them annoying and ridiculous (especially Toto) to have any real emotional bonds with anyone.The ending is decent, but it would have had more effect had all of the previous clutter not been strewn about the film.  All in all, this was just way to mushy and bloated for me."
Shortly as always; Acting isn't too good.. sounds that people produce seem artificial. This is a film about a boy growing up in the vicinity of a movie theater. On the background there is a war ongoing but the episodes of the film don't make much connection to it. Story is a bit boring at least from a Finnish point of view.. Only one or two episodes made me smile a bit but the humor isn't too intelligent. Maybe this film is good for some people that can imagine beyond what is shown. For me; characters didn't matter much. Music is more happy than melancholic and I could probably compose something more touching.. :D. Maybe this was a good movie 20 years ago but today you can see much better films with more atmosphere and with a better script.-WarraX-
"A love story, pure and simple. Not, as one might suppose, the doomed young love between Salvatore and Elena (a love he fails to recapture), but the pure father/son love between the local cinema projectionist, Alfredo and the fatherless Salvatore. The essential beauty of this film-long relationship is brought home in the greatest final scene any film in history ever had (IMHO). This has the hairs on the back of my neck stand to attention every single time I've seen it.With the themes this film addresses, it could so easily have been a gloop of mawkishness sentimentality. Sure, it has sentiments but there is a difference. The first time I saw this film I couldn't think or speak for over an hour afterwards (still a record).The Theatrical version is the one to see, for me, because the director's cut, whilst it adds information, does not add anything artistically at the cost of 50 extra minutes. In either version, the final scene is still the pay-off of sublime beauty."
"I so wanted to be engrossed by a film about a filmmakers romance with his villages movie theater and their projectionist. I wanted it to validate my own love of escapism, so wonderfully woven by incredibly directors who take us to such wonderful places that even our imagination couldn't have dreamed of. With such a grandiose name, the (lack of) family, village square, theater and boorish patrons fell short of endearing and, at times, fell short on many levels. Meaningful bits went on too long carried to 1970's made for TV levels by a overindulgent soundtrack. The actors played their parts, but with such inconsistent overdubbing, I felt for none of them. Yes the boy and projectionist bit was sweet, but not enough to carry the film. The older Totos' added no depth to the little boy. Conceptually nice and the scenes reenacting the crowds reaction to the theater and its limitations worked even if they were crude, but did we find a way to connect to movies as a character. I don't believe it was introduced until the final scene evidenced the character shunned from them by the church and I just couldn't relate, just like the film"
"I knew the film was held in high regard, and I went in with very high expectations.This is an incredible piece of cinema.The score/theme-music is perhaps Ennio Morricone's(Untouchables Etc) best, and that's saying something. It's only one of many fantastic characteristics that tie this whole thing together.""Cinema Paradiso"" seems like such a simple story, but nothing about the questions it asks about fate, love and friendship are simple.And that's what I really love about this story. It's realistic, heartbreaking, and uplifting all at the same time. The audience mimics the characters here. There are many things that you would like to change. How many times have you asked yourself if you would do it differently if you had it all over to do again? Could you? No. It's the way it happened. It's life. You can only piece together the moments of joy and happiness and reflect... hope.what a fantastic film!You'll like this if you liked: A Very Long Engagement(not quite as excellent), Hugo(a clear notch below and it borrowed a ton from this), or Cast Away(not as good, very similar themes in both films' last 30 min).this review is of the 3hr director's cut, not the theatrical release... I couldn't imagine it any other way. Will view it though.Late Edit(after viewing the shorter, original theatrical version): IMO.. the extended cut is far more powerful. The love story and the journey of the lead character is more complete, and ultimately, I find the extended cut to be much better. That's the version I would recommend to the first time viewer - although I seem to be in the minority on this subject."
"Not many movies make me cry- but this non-formulaic story works. The last 5 minutes are not to be missed by any classic movie fan.Lessons to be learned about the different ways movies and movie theatres and their denizens have been enjoyed throughout the decades. And the practice of censorship in a small Italian town. A homecoming, a funeral, and a heartwarming gift, and a terrible disaster. A story about a young boy striving for work in the glamorous movie theatre. Don't miss it.The Italian version with subtitles is excellent, and the soundtrack is amazing."
"Cinema Paradiso perfectly captures the obsessive and domineering power cinema has over its dedicated fans and their lives. Just like how our main child protagonist Toto becomes enchanted and engulfed by the movies, Cinema Paradiso is a movie which succeeds in doing just that. Cinema Paradiso takes the viewer back to a time when the movie theatre was at the heart of the community (where people would even jerk it and have sex in the middle of a crowded theater?! - Must be a European thing). Cinema Paradiso is my favourite foreign language film and what a rich experience it is. The music, scenery and vibrant architecture of Sicily immediately draw me in (man, Italians are so over the top) - I simply enjoy the essence of being there and I'd happily watch the movie without the subtitles on.The movie follows the relationship between Toto and his Freudian father figure Alfredo, a projectionist at the local cinema. Alfredo himself is very much a mythical character; he has no back-story or even a surname, yet he succeeds in being one of the most unforgettable characters in film history. He is a man who appears to have never made much for himself in life; ultimately a bit of a loser. This is one aspect of the story which really punches me in the gut; Alfredo prevents Toto from going down the same road as he did but as the cost of never having to see him again. It works and especially in the director's cut in which we learn Toto has become a famous filmmaker - wouldn't we all want an Alfredo in our lives?Did I mention Cinema Paradiso is the saddest movie of all time - fact. I recommend wearing a life jacket while watching this movie or you will drown in your own tears. This is one few films that give me teary-eyed goosebumps even thinking about it, or by listening to Ennio Morricone's score on (one of few scores I can listen to fully on repeat). I hate to imagine how much of a nihilist one would have to be not moved by the scene in which Alfredo makes a projected image travel along the walls and into the town square to the booming music.For the original Italian release or director's cut, the film had a run time of 173 minutes, for the international release it was cut to 124 minutes. I have to say however I greatly prefer the cut version. The director's cut examines the romantic relationship between characters Toto and Elena in much more detail, turning what is a subplot in cut version into a main focus of the story and while interesting to see the loose ends and the explained justification for Alfredo's actions, it does cause the movie to drag and in turn creating a version of the film with less emotional impact, whereas the cut version is a perfectly paced film. It also takes away some of the mystery posed by the shorter version, showing that some stories are best left untold and not everything has to be explained. I still feel the longer version is worth watching but it has made me dubious of director's cuts.Anyone passionate about cinema can't afford to miss Cinema Paradiso (that being unless you're a hardcore cynic, then this film will send you into a fit of rage) but aside from being a tribute to cinema, the film is full of emotions for nostalgia of childhood and youth, love and the losses we have to deal with during our lives. Like the stamp of any truly great film, Cinema Paradiso is a movie which you don't want to end. The cut version of Cinema Paradiso is Cinema Perfecto.International Cut - 10/10
Director's Cut - 7/10"
"As a big lover of film, I am still kicking myself for not seeing this masterpiece any sooner. To me, Cinema Paadiso is one of the best films of the 80s and also the most moving, particularly in the final hour.I have seen many visually stunning films, and Cinema Paradiso is up there as one of the most visually ravishing films I've seen. The cinematography and editing are outstanding, and the scenery still looks gorgeous with an epic feel to it. Cinema Paradiso, alongside The Good, The Bad and the Ugly and Once Upon a Time in the West, also contains one of Ennio Morricone's most haunting scores and it is also one of my favourites of his.Cinema Paradiso is immaculately directed, has an touching, beautifully-written and honest script and a rich, compelling story that while it has an elegiac feel moves swiftly by draws you right in until the ending, which breaks my heart still after 5 times of seeing it.The characters are very well defined, particularly Alfredo, and the acting is outstanding with Salvatore Cascio, Enzo Cannavale, Marco Leonardi and especially Phillippe Noiret particularly impressive. All in all, a masterpiece. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"Five minutes after I have watched this movie,slowly calming down,I am now writing my feelings down and you must know how much I want to share it with everyone who loves this movie!The movie ""Nuovo Cinema Paradiso"" moved me greatly and the feelings are so strong that I can't even describe it.As they say,Beauty in terms of human words is meaningless.It is a movie about movie,a story about love and friendship and everything that a living human being can feel.A lovely and smart child ,living with a desperate mother waiting for her beloved husband at war,grew up with movies and finally became a famous director.He once loved a beautiful woman and the woman loved him too.However,as we all know,love is fragile.Love immediately comes to an end the moment it meets with marriage.So,is there a way that makes love eternal,always smiling at you when you open your eyes in the morning? I had guessed the beginning but I didn't get the ""fine"".That's why it's such a great movie. ""The soldier stop waiting and go away at the very 99th day,when a day after he would probably have the princess' heart."" Maybe sometimes the best thing to do is to walk away,leaving the memory lasting forever.The last fifty minutes of the movie,particularly I think, is the best part.The climax comes when the man and the woman meet each other again thirty years after their inevitable miss.I cant help burst into tears cause I can't hold it anymore after 2 hours' living together with the excellent characters.It's not until this day,by this movie that I am successfully convinced A man can really hold his love for as much as 30 years!Life is like a movie,but it's harder."
"The 1988 Oscar winner for Best Foreign Film is, for all its incidental charm, every bit as mushy as the movies it celebrates, elevating a passion for movie-going in a small Sicilian village to a magical experience able to cure any distress, allowing even a blind man to 'see'. The mood of the film is warm and sentimental but its message is, at best, inconsistent: movies, it says, may be wonderful, but are no substitute for experience, and yet after reaching maturity the young protagonist spends thirty years in limbo before reclaiming his childhood innocence in the censored outtakes saved by his now deceased mentor, kindly old theater projectionist Philippe Noiret. Even worse: the films of his youth are presented as escapist daydreams, but his entire life (revealed in flashback from childhood to middle age) is no less an illusion, transformed by nostalgia into a heart tugging, romantic tearjerker. Life, it seems, not only imitates art, but often improves upon it, inadequate dubbing notwithstanding."
"With the exception of a few of De Sica's films during the Neorealist days of the 40s and 50s, I think this is the finest Italian film I have seen. It is highly reminiscent of Fellini's Amarcord, though even better (and that's saying a lot), because it offers a wonderful and nostalgic look back at how life used to be. And, it is told so gently and affectionately that you can't help but love the film and the characters. The film is named after the local theater because it is the focal point for this community through the many years the film encompasses. Gentle, beautiful and full of humor and grace--this is a wonderful film for pretty much the entire family and you can't help but admire all those associated with it."
"This is such a difficult film to describe in words because all of it is heartfelt emotion. However, it must be noted that the three central performances are beyond reproach: the child Salvatore (played with rascally charm by Salvatore Cascio), the brusque projectionist Alfredo (Philippe Noiret) and the adolescent Salvatore (Marco Leonardi). All three are masterful in creating the viewer's emotional attachment to these characters. The relationship between the tough but tender projectionist and the little boy is what carries the first half of the film and it continues when the boy becomes a lovesick adolescent. It is only the last half of the film that seems to drag a little with scenes of the adult Salvatore (Jacques Perrin)contemplating returning to the little village where he grew up in the shadows of the movie theater and those wonderful silver shadows on the screen.All of the scenes involving the movie theater and its rowdy audiences are wonderfully realized with crude humor and insight into the kind of characters who thrived on whatever entertainment films could offer. Ennio Morriconne's music is charming throughout, always totally in keeping with the images on screen and the intentions of the story.By all means, well worth seeing and treasuring as one of the great foreign films to come out of the 1980s. I watched the abbreviated version on TCM which comes to a little more than two hours and is the version shown in the U.S. theatrically."
"Arguably the best foreign language film and definitely one of the greatest films of all time, ""Cinema Paradiso"" was quietly ignored by most in Italy when it was released in 1989. But those in the Academy saw it and it won the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar for that year in a no-brainer decision. The film starts with a phone call to famous director Jacques Perrin who learns that a dear friend of his has passed away from the Sicilian village where he spent his youth. What follows are flashbacks to his youth in Sicily and his friendship to a middle-aged man (the amazing Philippe Noiret) who happened to run the projector at the local movie theater. As a young boy (Salvatore Cascio) we see the character being given pieces of film that are cut from the movies due to what the local priest believes to be questionable material (people kissing). The nostalgia the young boy feels will directly create a genuine love and respect for the world's greatest medium. As he becomes an adolescent (Marco Leonardi) he experiences love and the possibility of war. Together he and Noiret go through many triumphs and tragedies together, but as much as everything changes the love for movies stays a constant always. Then there comes a time for the youngster to create his own destiny by leaving the village, but he takes more than anyone could ever imagine with him. ""Cinema Paradiso"" is excellent in every way possible. The story is arguably the best the cinema has ever experienced. It is easily the greatest homage to the power and love of movies. Giuseppe Tornatore's amazing direction and writing prove to raise the movie into a classic level. Ennio Morricone also created perhaps the best soundtrack a film has ever sported. There is nothing negative I can say about this magnificent movie. I love it and it is a film that is close to my heart. Beyond excellence. 5 stars out of 5."
"I really don't understand how this film got to be so famous and widely recommended. Two hours of clumsy sentimentality, in which nothing happens; a coming-of-age tale which tackles none of the problems of adolescence; characters who spend most of their time simpering over each other, yet they never bother trying to make them connect with the viewer; child acting so dreadful a wooden puppet with its strings cut would have been a better replacement...I resent the laziness of the film, they thought they could rely on its magic formula of nostalgia, saccharine and being foreign so they thought ""we don't need to bother building up any genuine feeling for these characters"". The story starts with an incorrigible young tyke (who i found extremely irritating) befriending the local projectionist. That's about all you need to know, what there is of a plot that develops from there doesn't really matter - it doesn't offer any interest, it doesn't put any of the characters in a dilemma, it all just dissolves into the steady flow of sap. With a plot development occurring every twenty minutes or so, thank God that we're anchored to the motif of the cinema by lengthy footage of people sitting around in it, making entertaining comments which make us just resonate with the warmth of the Italian people. More sugar anyone? Perhaps if I had a very fragile and elderly relative - I mean several centuries old - for whom trying to follow a plot that wasn't totally linear might get their blood up, who was too mentally impaired to take a character at anything but face value, for whom nuanced was just a seven letter word they weren't sure how to spell, then I might recommend to them Cinema Paradiso. Although the possibility that their heart might stop mid-way through, making me culpable for their death, would make me think twice. In fact I think I've got it, Cinema Paradiso might be a very good film to die to. Especially if you've been incapacitated waiting to die for a very long time, and would like to assure yourself that other people have been subjected to something of what you're going through.The Spirit of the Beehive (La Espíritu de la Colmena) is sometimes presented as Cinema Paradiso gone right, again centred on a cinema in a small town and a child's reaction to it. Sure it's slow, and makes no concessions to commercialism, but it is beautifully directed and in an understated way develops the viewer's empathy for the characters. Exactly the opposite of the crass tedium of the film I've just had the misfortune to see."
"Cinema Paradiso is one of the few movies, that I watch every second year or so.
Every time an emotional rollercoaster where you laugh and cry.
The only movie that pulls out every romantic and emotional side of you and make you cry like never before.A film about love for movies, friendship and most important about strong, untamed and hopeless love between two persons.
It's not a ""happy end"" movie, but there's also something beautiful in experiencing unhappiness.
An important player in this movie is also the beautiful music by Ennio Morricone and my favourite actor/actress is Jacques Perrin, who plays the older Totò."
"""Cinema Paradiso"" has got to be one of the most beautiful and heartfelt films I've ever seen. The story, which is packed with raw emotion, and a beautiful bond between two characters make this film a real joy to watch and will keep you moved throughout the whole 155 minutes in which it runs for.This film follows young Salvatore (Toto), who lives in a small Italian village during the Second World War. Fatherless, he begins to form a bond with the projectionist at the local cinema, Alfredo (Philippe Noiret), a friendship in which the film revolves around.The acting in this is quite good; Philippe Noiret gives a great performance as Alfredo as do all three actors who play Salvatore. But it is not these performances that stand out, but the direction of writer-director Giuseppe Tornatore. Only 32 years of age at the date of its release, Tornatore is able to add beautiful and heartfelt emotion in every single friendship in this film, whether it be between friends, family or lovers. Alfredo and Salvatore's bond is given so much depth and sentiment, that when the smallest things happened to one of them, your heart started racing. The screenplay is able to stay true to the way this film is directed, as it equally as charming as the product which adapted it. Without Tornatore's talent and incentive, this film wouldn't have even been merely what it is.A beautifully sentimental film that brings out the best in friendship, all spearheaded by the masterclass of a ridiculously talented Giuseppe Tornatore, ""Cinema Paradiso"" has got to be the greatest tale of friendship ever shown on the big screen.Rating: 9.6/10Grade: A+"
"I've never been a huge fan of Italian movie industry (Spaghetti western simply killed my mind), especially I have to biased approach towards the Italian-French crossover movies, having the belief that all they are about are the strong mature romantic scenes (well, the last scene made kind of reaffirm this belief:) ).But! This movie is everything for million reasons: great humor, realisticly kind, touchy yet not in a cliche melodrama way, super dynamic AND gives you RIGHT lessons about true friendship. In contrary to ""Good Will Hunting"", where an older friend of a father-less boy gives him a ""follow your dreams and forget about your talent"" kind of mainstream advice (IMHO. sorry, if it's your favorite movie tho), in Nuovo Cinema Paradiso the old friend truly cares about the boy, shows him the true face of love and life before he is left heartbroken, directs him for a better life and higher standards. Alfredo shows Toto that nostalgia is the feeling that keeps us where we are and at the end of the day we realize that we belong to nowhere. Moreover, aren't most of his word simply quote worthy (and I am not even talking about real old Hollywood quotes he used)?Well, I was left with two questions at the end: I did not completely get the very last scene of the movie, but it must be a tribute to the old Hollywood. And was Toto actually happy with the life he get? His mother said a wise thing at the end: we pay for our goals and dreams by loneliness. Is it always true or is it possible to balance? Was it possible for Toto to find the true love after all this time, or did he stick to Elena's memories just to have that nostalgic little shelf in his heart against the whole beautiful, dirty and rich life he ended up in? That's some good food for thought, and all the great directors leave us with similar questions, so that we will not forget the movie in the nearest future.Will definitely watch it with my kids one day!"
It was incredible .. when he returned I was crying like it was me that leaved that city 30 years ago
"Not much to add to this movie, who we have left our homes to begin our life, we have that feeling of rootlessness to turn away from our house. The distance we feel about our family, our home, friends, and villagers note reflected in this film. The soundtrack makes perfect the convention between nostalgia and love for our roots.No one may not shake with the final song and the sound that comes directly to the heart. It is a work of art, landscapes, music and history to fill our souls. Some enjoy more than others but nobody remained unsatisfied at the end of this film. Stunningly beautiful from start to finish"
"A village comes to life as a man dreams of a character who directed his entire life. He was a projectionist a run down movie theater which formed the center of entertainment in the community. We are introduced to Toto who lives with his mother who waits for her husband to come home from the Russian front. He is a scalawag who disobeys her and finds ways to spend time with Alfredo, the protectionist. He is in constant trouble but always comes to this man for direction, even though the guy finds him to be a pain in the butt. One night, the movie projector catches fire as does the film (nitrate film did this in the early days) and blinds the old man. Toto becomes the projectionist, even though he is but ten years old. He also becomes the eyes of his friend. He stays at the job, ignoring school, and eventually makes some modest films himself. As he does this, he sees a beautiful young woman with whom he falls in love. This whole film captures the essence of the city. We get to know a multitude of characters because their lives revolve around the movies being shown at the Cinema Paradiso. Toto (not his real name) returns to his home when his mother leaves a message for him that Alfredo has died. He has really cut off ties with the place and it is a painful trip back. But it pulls at our hearts. Things are almost magical. One of the best films every made."
"I am not a big fan of movies released in 80's or earlier. I didn't expect much from this movie and watched it only owing to its high rating and ranking at IMDb. But buoy.. was I amazed. The movie is just less than 3 hours(extended version) but there is not a single moment where you find yourself detached from the movie. I wont call the acting at its best but its the story that forms the backbone of the movie. The story brings out relationship between three main pillars of human life - 'Love', 'Friendship' and 'Carrier'. This is the best romantic drama movie I have ever seen. If you weigh story more than big actor names and watching with subtitles is not a turn off(for non Italians) then this is a must watch for you."
"As any cinema lover, Cinema Paradiso is on top of my list. This great Italian movie takes us on a trip through the life of Salvatore (aka Toto). Salvatore recalls his childhood when coming back to his hometown for the funeral of Alfredo, the theater projectionist. The relationship between Salvatore and Alfredo is the center of the story and we can't help to be warmth by it. Alfredo also passed to Salvatore all is knowledge about traditional cinema helping him to make the first steps in cinematography.Salvatore also remembers his first love, Elena, and tries to understand why they didn't stay together. When he finally understands it, he is devastated.The movie give us also a hint of the beginning of cinema for masses, church restrictions on cinema and changes in cinema through time. The last scene is one of the best ever made: emotional and beautiful. I always feel my eyes wet.After the movie, I only could think: Do we really have to choose between two lives? Does someone have the right to choose a life for us?http://movieadviser.blogspot.com/"
