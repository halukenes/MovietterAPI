"I saw Harakiri (Seppuku) in a new 35 mm print at NYC's Film Forum. This is a brilliant use of a narrow period genre to explosively indict politics and culture. Writers Shinobu Hashimoto and Yasuhiko Takiguchi surely must have been as inspired by ""The Count of Monte Cristo,"" Ambrose Bierce and Howard Hawks' Westerns as much as by samurai literature and movies.The film begins deceptively as a story within a story, seemingly providing a traditional example of upholding samurai honor, such as in the conventional, oft-retold tale of ""The 47 Ronin."" The context is set at a time when the central government, the shogunate, is supplanting local clans and arbitrarily unemploying thousands of people, notably their samurai, forcing them into the mercenary mode of ronin at best and begging for food at worse. But the parallels to the 20th century are made repeatedly explicit as the samurai who comes to this clan seeking help is from Hiroshima.Very gradually we get further insight on the tale within a tale, as we see more flashbacks within flashbacks into what each character has been doing before these confrontations and we get uneasy inklings that the moral of the story may not be what it appears at first and the stakes get higher and higher with almost unbearable tension.It is almost halfway through the film until we see a female and we suddenly see an alternative model of masculinity, where a priority is put on family, support, education and creative productivity. In comparison to the macho opening relationships, with their emphasis on formal militaristic loyalty to a hierarchy, a loving husband and father is practically a metrosexual. Seeing the same stalwart samurai making casual goo goo sounds to his grandbaby puts the earlier, ritualized scenes in sharp relief, particularly the recurring image of the clan's armor which seems less and less imposing and is finally destroyed as an empty symbol.The psychological tension in the confrontations in the last third of the film is more excruciating than the actual violence. Even when we thought we already knew the outcome from the flashbacks, the layers of perception of relationships and personalities are agonizingly peeled away with each thrust of a sword to reveal the depths of the horrifying hypocrisy of the political and social structure. And those are just the overwhelming cultural resonances that a 21st century American can glean. Like ""Downfall (Der Untergang),"" it reveals the inhumane mentality that led to World War II.The repeating motif of long walks then confrontations down empty corridors emphasizes the stultifying bureaucratic maze that entraps the characters. The revenge motifs are accented by startlingly beautiful cinematography that recalls traditional Japanese art, including drops of blood like first snow flakes then a waterfall.The over all effect of this masterpiece is emotionally draining."
"I've said it once about another movie, incidentally by the other great Japanese director as well and I want to repeat my words in regard to ""Harakiri"": ""There are good, very good, and even great movies. But among them there are just a few that go beyond great. They belong to the league of their own"". Masaki Kobayashi's ""Harakiri"" aka ""Seppuku"" is one of them. The film of rare power and humanism, of highest artistic achievements, profoundly moving, tragic like the best Shakespeare's plays, universal and timeless even if it takes place in the faraway country of 1630, by the words of one of the reviewers ""Harakiri"" ""is to cinema as the Sistine Chapel is to painting. Unsurpassable!"" The film grabbed me from the very first shot, from its opening credits with their perfect harmony of kanji (I believe it is a correct word to describe the writings) characters, with the unusual disturbing score and with the dark beauty of the images. And then the story begins that centers on Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai), one of hundreds or maybe even thousands unemployed lord less samurais, ronin, that in the blessed times of peace had not many choices to adjust to new life and often preferred to commit a ritual suicide, hara-kiri or seppuku on the property of the wealthy estate owners. According to Bushido, the way of the samurai, ""One who is a samurai must before all things keep constantly in mind, by day and by night . . . the fact that he has to die. That is his chief business."" At the same time, samurai and anti-samurai film, ""Harakiri"" offers the masterfully screened scenes of sword-fights, not plentiful but exquisitely choreographed, perfectly paced and unbearably intense but the film is much more than that. It is also a gripping court drama where the truth is unfolded in the flashbacks. The viewers are allowed to look closer at the noble Samurai code of behavior and to reflect on how its abuse impacts the fate of an individual and the society in general. Compelling, poetic, and tragic, the movie has one of the most pessimistic endings ever that makes you wonder how the history is made, how the historical events are interpreted and who decides what would be written in the chronicles and important documents and what would be left out.A Masterpiece, one of the best movies ever made, ""Harakiri"" deserves all its praise. It is not in my nature to force my opinion on anyone but if you call yourself a movie buff or a movie lover, you MUST see this film."
"When I first saw this movie, I did not know much about it. I saw it for a class so I was given a little background of the time period. In fact I was pretty much just told this: This movie takes place during the time where many Samurai were left ronins, or masterless. These samurai were unable to find work and thereby were left in poverty. Eventually many would go up to clans and ask to commit seppuku.It was dishonorable to refuse such a ""noble"" request, but most clans did not want samurai to kill themselves on their property so they would just pay the samurai to go elsewhere.So I watched the movie and well... I loved it. During the class discussion the next day I found most people hated the movie. Not because it was a bad movie, but because of how it made people feel about themselves. And that's exactly why this movie is genius. If you're interested in watching this movie, do not read the summary in detail - reading the summary in detail will deprive you of what one of the key things that made the movie great IMO."
"This film is the purest distillation of the spirit of Greek tragedy ever put on celluloid.  Yes, this is a review of Seppuku, a Japanese film released in 1962.  Perhaps it took a non-Westerner, free of all of the cultural baggage and ridiculous associations, to see straight into the heart of the tragic mode and make it palpable and alive in the twentieth century.  That is not all: the black and white cinematography is both formally assured and often outrageously daring; the soundtrack is one of the finest efforts of the greatest Japanese composer of the 20th century (or any century for that matter); the acting is demonically inspired; and the narrative is relentlessly gripping and involving.  The film illuminates the relationship between the individual and society and between society and history.  It is a tender meditation on familial love and the ties of friendship that transcend even death.  This film will cut open your bowels, pull your soul out, and force you to stare it in the face.  There may be other films that attain similar heights, but I cannot imagine any film, ever, being more perfect. Forget Citizen Kane, Seven Samurai, the Godfather, etc. etc. all of those commodified canonical works that everybody raves about because everybody else is raving about them.  Don't get me wrong, they're fine--but this stuff is 200 proof.  See it today.  Buy it yesterday."
"Harakiri is an excellent human drama set in feudal Japan that involves a ronin presenting himself to a powerful clan and asking to commit harikiri. However, through a series of flashbacks we see that this ronin is motivated by more than the idea of dying honorably. The events that follow are a critique of the feudal system and a celebration of dying for one's beliefs.Every frame in Harikiri is wonderfully composed and a treat to view. The cinematography is crisp, the sets wonderful and the actors are spectacular. Much can be said about this film's technical merits as well as its social implications. I found out about this film through my love of Akira Kurosawa's samurai dramas (who else...) and I must say that it is very different from Kurosawa-sans work although it draws inevitable comparisons. Due to its themes, Harikiri is more of an anti samurai film. Generally Kurosawa's work seems to glorify the honor of the samurai and celebrate them as Japanese heroes by showing them gloriously in battle. Kurosawa is the Japanese John Ford, taking an icon from his culture and celebrating it. Harikiri exposes the virtues that Kurosawa portrays as being ""a facade"" to directly quote the film.I say this so as not to mislead any potential viewers, I do not know enough about Japanese history to judge what the samurai really stood for and really I am not concerned with the idea. This is the only Kobyashi film I have seen and it has been brought to my attention that many of his films deal with similar themes. All in all I think that Harikiri is a wonderful film that offers a new take on feudal Japan."
"I have seen this movie numerous times (at least 10, probably many more), and enjoy it each time.  The first couple of times I saw it was right after it came out.  It did not have sub-titles, and as my Japanese is not very good, I made some assumptions about the characters, relationships, the plot,etc. When I saw it with sub-titles, I was surprised at how few incorrect assumptions I had made.  That I made so few errors is no credit to me, but rather to how well the plot, character development, character relationships, and the overall movie were done.The movie is not limited to feudal Japan, for it transcends this era.  It has lessons, for those who look for this in art.  For instance, just one example occurs to me now:  It underscores the need for a person to stand on principle, and to maintain their honor, ethics, and dignity, even when those who are the political leaders have long since lost theirs.  However for purely entertainment value, the realism, suspense, art, and action could not be better. Words fail to express how this film captivates and entertains. Few films can equal this one.  It is a ""must see."""
"""Harakiri"" (""Seppuku"") (Japanese, 1962): It is the 17th century. A young Samurai warrior arrives at a mansion, asking to perform his ritual death there. In a series of flashbacks, we learn who he is, why he came, and what has occurred since. Although quietly told by another ex-warrior (about whom we also learn more), this is an interesting story that builds in complexity and tension. Debates about rituals and appearances may at first seem to hold more significance in old Japan than in the contemporary United States, but it is not difficult to translate and implement such thoughts. Love, honor, duty, family, children, saving ""face"", determination, desperationthey all exist in OUR everyday lives. Dramatically photographed in beautiful black & white, given a strong Japanese score, and paced so that even the mildly patient will be glad they saw it, ""Harakiri"" is epically huge, and a must-see for story & film lovers."
"Having seen this film the mind becomes clouded with the innumerable things to say about it. Only praise comes to mind. Kobayashi has crafted The great samurai film for the rebel generation and he mixes a deftly handled criticism of authoritarian hypocrisy with a very touching piece of human drama.The plot is deceptively simple: an old samurai (touchingly portrayed by Tatsuya Nakadai of ""Ran"", ""Kagemusha"" and ""Sword of Doom"") arrives at a clan castle to commit seppuku in their yard, and then tells his tale, seemingly trying to gain time at first. What seems to be the rambling of an old man soon turns out to be a grieving account of how this man (and, more significantly, his loved ones) was wronged by the clan. Then comes the violent revenge (this is where you think ""Wild Bunch with katanas"", though they do up the ante toward the end with guns...).Kobayashi's direction is masterful, keeping an unbearable suspense during the mostly talky film, handling the touching scenes with care and maturity and giving us a sweeping fight to top all that. The 133 minutes running time never feels half that long! At the heart of it all though, is Nakadai, who, despite an excellent CV, delivers his greatest performance ever. His Tsugumo evokes a wounded panther, grieving an grieving until it gives in to fury. Nakadai's performance alone marks the film as essential viewing.If you're open to samurai flicks, this will rank among the finest films you've ever seen."
"Seven Samurai is pretty great, but I think Harakiri is even better. This tale of a ronin seeking revenge and exposing the flawed samurai code is so close to perfection. The story is engrossing and despite the slow pacing it's never boring. What the production lacks in scale it makes up for with emotional intensity. The sparse, ominous score is perfect for this film. The direction and cinematography are masterful and the camera's slow pans and zooms really butter my croissant. The editing is great and purposeful too. There's not a single weak performance but Tatsuya Nakadai in the leading role steals the show.My only complaints are with some of the pacing and fight choreography. There's a standoff scene in the middle that could have been cut (since it felt like a cheap way to build tension and it wouldn't make sense for them to continue waiting afterward) and the long flashback could have also been trimmed. The film is 2 hours 13 minutes but I think exactly 2 hours would have been perfect. From a fight choreography standpoint the one-on-one fight scenes were well done but climax was shaky. There were many interesting ideas and moments in there, but also several points where I was like ""okay, how did they not strike him there?""Harakiri is an outstanding film that deserves more attention. If you haven't seen this film check it out. The Criterion restoration is absolutely beautiful. I intentionally kept this review vague since it's best to go into it knowing as little as possible. With a few thousand more ratings, this film would be pretty high up on the IMDb Top 250, and I'd be delighted to see it there."
"This movie is powerful classic, that is almost perfect. It was way ahead of its time, and comes from an era when Japanese cinema was one that brought us many timeless gems. The samurai story is eternal story of well placed revenge, hypocrisy, morality, it brings philosophical examinations to the forefront. Acting is exceptional, emotion is raw, film has many subtle yet brilliant moments. Certainly one of the great classics of Japanese cinema, not to be missed by anyone."
"It's quite surprising that some old masterpieces fall easily into the oblivion. Harakiri (Seppuku) is a good example. Quite simply this is one of the best Japanese movies I've ever seen. Everything is this movie is exceptional: the cinematography is top notch, the acting is very good, the direction is almost perfect.Tragedy, revenge, ethics, political contents...this movie has all of these elements wrapped in an exceptional 16th century samurai environment.The only defects I could see in this movie is that someone may feel it is slightly slow (as actually there are very few action scenes...this is not a ""chambara"" movie!) and the fact that it is not dubbed (at least in the Italian edition)...so you lose some of the details while reading the subtitles....that is, unless you understand Japanese.If you like black & white Japanese movies this is definitely a must see. GREAT."
"A classic, surviving the test of time -- made in 1962 about 17th century people. Here in 2005, we still watch and discuss the film and the issues that it raises. Tsugumo Hanshiro, a middle-aged ronin formerly serving a clan abolished by the Shogunate, appears at the Ii clan gate. He wishes to commit seppuku rather than live on in poverty. In his inner headquarters, Saito Kageyu, the chief retainer, bemoans the fact that hordes of starving ronin have been making similar requests at clan gates; most have wanted handouts rather than to actually commit seppuku. Kageyu suspects the same of Hanshiro. Kageyu attempts to discourage Hanshiro. He tells a tale of another ronin from the same abolished clan, Chijiiwa Motome. Motome had appeared a few months earlier, with a request, but had carried bamboo sword blades  the clan members had been enraged. As an example to other scrounging ronin, particularly those without real blades, the clan decided to force Motome to commit seppuku with his own bamboo wakizashi. Hanshiro tells his own life story. The film shows us some historical background. Thousands of ex-retainers had been thrown out of their positions, made into ronin, by the Shogunate's abolishing of clans. In the rigid class system (samurai, farmers, artisans, merchants), these displaced ex-retainers had no place at all, being forced into marginal subsistence. Most trades (because they required long periods of apprenticeship) were out for most ronin. Many ronin became outlaws or obtained bodyguard positions for gangsters. If law-abiding, they were able to teach in schools for commoner children. Or become piecework artisans; they could contract with wholesalers (who also lent money) to make fans, umbrellas, insect cages, ink brushes, and the like. Even as most ronin had to fend for themselves in this netherworld, they still were to carry the two swords of their original rank, and to uphold their obligations. Hanshiro and his daughter Miho make umbrellas and fans to sell to wholesalers for a pittance; Hanshiro is in debt to one of the wholesalers. Motome teaches commoner children and receives a minimal wage for his work. Miho and Motome marry and have a son. All goes well until sickness strikes. Miho contracts consumption and the child contracts a fever. Neither Hanshiro nor Motome can afford a doctor. Motome attempts to get a laborer job (which pays more than teaching does) and runs straight into job discrimination: ""no starving ronin need apply."" Motome sells his sword blades at a pawnshop, obtaining bamboo blades to wear inside his sword fittings, not an uncommon practice; some ronin (and some low-ranked clan samurai) desperately needed money. And yet, the sword was considered to be ""the soul of the bushi."" A bushi who sold his blades had to appear to wear the badge of his rank. The bamboo blades were available, thus no one would know of the despicable act of having sold his ""soul"" for money.But Motome has not received enough; he still cannot afford a doctor. So Motome decides on something more desperate: to appear at a clan gate, with his hidden bamboo blades, in order to request seppuku -- with the actual intention of receiving a handout to get a doctor for his wife and child. The Ii clan officials have decided differently. The scene where Motome must commit seppuku with his bamboo wakizashi is one of the most harrowing scenes ever filmed. Motome is utterly humiliated, surrounded by the Ii clan retainers, with Onodaka Hikokuro, his assigned second preaching on how the sword is the soul of the samurai, the bamboo sword is what is appropriate for Motome, and so forth. While Motome painfully carries forth. Hikokuro refuses Motome's request to cut off his head and end the ritual's mockery, so Motome ends it himself, biting off his tongue. Hanshiro has realized -- too late -- that he had never dared to even consider selling his own sword blades to help out the family. The scene when he is confronted with Motome's body and the truth of what has happened is truly gut-wrenching, as Hanshiro weeps and slams down his ""useless tokens"" that he had clung to. Hanshiro reveals his own secret  he has used his ""useless tokens"" to avenge Motome's death. He has tracked down the three Ii retainers who were most responsible for Motome's death. The final duel between Hanshiro and Onodaka Hikokuro is absolutely stunning. Instead of taking the lives of these three, Hanshiro has taken their topknots. And while Kageyu has preached to Hanshiro about samurai honor, these three swordsmen have hidden themselves away, claiming sickness to cover up their own shame, while their topknots grow back. Kageyu cannot deal with Hanshiro's revelations. He commands his men to slaughter Hanshiro. Hanshiro fights back gamely, taking four of the Ii clan retainers and wounding several more. In a symbolic scene, he tears down the ancestral armor of the Ii clan. Some Ii clansmen use their rifles against Hanshiro, but Hanshiro sticks his own sword into his belly, committing seppuku as he has pledged to do. In the end, Kageyu fashions a cover-up of the entire event; mysterious plagues have hit the Ii clan and a number of their retainers, including Onodaka, have died of ""illness"" rather than by the blade of an impoverished hungry ronin. This film raises many issues. It is Kobayashi's impassioned protest against rigidly militaristic societies that uphold hypocritical codes of ""bushido"" while disdaining what that term really means. The film is also like a Greek tragedy, with a character (Tsugumo Hanshiro) possessing the tragic flaw of his own pride -- which in the end, he must pay for with his life. Which he does in a heroic way. This film doesn't just recount the oppression of poor people. It shows the strength that these poor people have, the choices that they make as individuals, refusing to just bow down and be mere victims of their society."
"Masaki Kobayashi studied art and philosophy before starting as assistant director at Shochiku studio. His oeuvre is guided by the need to understand the human condition. In the 1962 Hara-kiri aka Seppuku, we can clearly see the philosophic influence in this story about confrontation between Human condition and Rigid Code of a feudal society. The result of this confrontation is a multi layered masterpiece in which the clarity of the script, the perfection of the interpretation, and a very well balanced ""mise en scène"" make for a powerful film based on transgression: a genre transgression, a code transgression and an image transgression. Most of Shambaras take place during the Edo Period but rather late in that period (just before the Meiji Era) as most filmmakers try to romanticize and glamorize the period which marks the end of the Samurai thus playing the nostalgia card. Here Masaki Kobayashi transgressed the genre and decided to film a story taking place in 1630, 17th century Japan during the Edo period. At that time Japan was ruled by a Shogunate (Ieyasu Tokugawa). The Tokugawa Shoguns established Peace and continued to rule Japan for a remarkable 250 years. But such a long period of Peace had a price and Ieyasu Tokugawa brought the whole country under tight control. He cleverly redistributed the land among the more loyal vassals, breaking up warrior clans thus throwing thousands of samurai into poverty. In the film an elder ronin, Hanshiro Tsugumo, the hypnotic Tatsuya Nakadai (Goyokin) seeks admittance to the house of a feudal lord to commit the act of Seppuku as he can no longer stand his Life of Dishonor and Poverty. There, the administrator tells him about the fate of a young Samurai who committed the same suicidal ritual few times ago. But there is much more to this story and soon we understand that all protagonists are related one way or another. As the film progresses we witness a confrontation between two conceptions. One is based on a Human code; the other is based on a rigid traditional one. Masaki Kobayashi uses both symbols and raw images to show this confrontation. The film starts with the Display of a Samurai shining battle armor representing the feudal system. The armor is empty of anything human and strongly symbolized the feudal system. Can a code make sense if it is followed without acknowledging the Human condition? This is in essence the question raised by ""Hara-kiri"". We see this armor soiled and dragged but at the end of the film the armor remains intact as if nothing had ever happened, as if changes in an given Society take some times to occur. Indeed social Progress has always been slow leaving Men and Women struggling with their condition. The suicidal ritual, Hara-kiri reinforced the sense of cruelty. Raw images of Ronin opening their stomach with a sword were a transgression at that time (1962), still is today. In the film the ritual is portrayed in a non glamorized way and very realistically. It also symbolizes even for the Japanese audience the lack of sense in the act of Seppuku. In fact Hanshiro Tsugumo is the only one giving meaning to this act by motivating it with mixed feelings of Love, Revenge and Sorrow, in short with humanity. With the film Hara-kiri, Masaki Kobayashi signed one of the greatest philosophical films. The script by Shinobu Hashimoto is a good example on how to make a story clear but more importantly sufficient enough for anybody to understand the drama, in one word universal. Also writer of Jôi-uchi: Hairyô tsuma shimatsu aka Samurai Rebellion (1967), Dai-bosatsu tôge (1966) aka Sword of Doom or ""Hitokiri"" aka Tenchu (1969), Shinobu Hashimoto is among the greatest writers of the 7th Art. I can not recommend Seppuku enough, every single frame, acting, piece of music is irreproachable. The story is profoundly Humanist, timeless and universal. I suggest we all confront the codes of our respective societies in order to find out if they still make sense or if they are leading us towards a terrible social Hara-kiri"
"Well what can I say.. this 1962 movie directed by Masaki Kobayashi is one of the MOST powerful movies I have ever seen in my life! It is really a tremendous example of outstanding film making! The cinematography is absolutely exceptional! However it is the haunting plot of a samurai explaining the meaningless and worthless flawed belief of the samurai spirit which grips the viewer.Tatsuya Nakadais mighty performance in Harakiri further proves for me, that he is without a doubt one of best actors in the history of film. This man takes on his roles with such prowess that it is easy for the viewer to forget that you have seen him play a different role in another movie.By the way - The Criterion 2 disk DVD version is mint! An a MUST HAVE in any fans collection."
"Seppuku opens up with a shot of the samurai battle armor. Simply a shell with nothing in it at the time. Seppuku reveals the hypocrisy and emptiness in the samurai code and that things are not always as they seem. It challenges traditional belief of honor and what is to be done and simply not to be done. Through the movie the director leads us into belief that Motome is a bad samurai. He is masterless and furthermore unable to provide for his family. It opens up with his preformed seppuku in which everything goes wrong for Motome, we see his as a horrible honor less samurai. Motome comes to the house obviously to beg for food or money. We see that his swords, the soul of the samuari, were sold for bamboo ones. Than he begs for leave seemingly to run away to not have to perform the seppuku. However, things are not as they seem. Hanshiro shows up to the house of the same group. Than, he tells the story as it actually was. Motome was actually trying to provide for his family. He sold his swords for food and comfort for his dieing wife. Then comes to the house to beg for money only so he can afford a doctor for his dying infant son as well. When Motome begs for leave before his seppuku he actually needs time to go back to his family to tell them that he was unsuccessful in getting money and they would have to find other means. What is more just or had more honor, following the samurai code, or trying to save the lives of your dying family members. The writer answers that later in the movie. Hanshiro defeats every samurai that brought his son in law back to him dead by cutting off their top knots. If the house had the honor that they said they did than these three samurai would commit seppuku. None of the samurai do. They fake an illness so their topknot can grow back. The author shows that the samurai honor is really just a front, it is just an image, like the old samurai battle armor. The code represents who they want to be, but the honor is not there. Seppuku is a great story about hypocrisy and fake honor of the samurai code."
"It would seem impossible that any ""samurai"" movie could surpass Kurosawa's ""Ran,"" ""Kagemusha,"" or even ""Rashomon"" in visual impact, masterful storytelling, and moral imperative. However, there is such a film, and it is ""Seppuku"" (""Harakiri""), produced in 1962, arguably the best samurai movie ever made.""Harakiri"" (1962), as it is known in the West, was directed by one of the post-WWII great filmmakers of Japan, Masaki Kobayashi. This film, considered by many as his masterpiece, won him the International Jury Prize at Cannes in 1965. Unfortunately, Kabayashi is not as well known outside Japan as some other giants of the Japanese cinema. He was very much affected by the war, and his films, contrary to most Japanese filmmakers of the post-war eras, are very political in nature. Kobayashi's films explore the dark side of the Japanese culture, with its wars, corruption, and hypocrisy, and their consequences. His film, ""The Thick-Walled Room"" (1953), won him the 1956 Peace Culture Prize. His nine-hour trilogy, ""The Human Condition"" (1959/61), won the International Jury Prize at Cannes 1963, which actually launched his public recognition, presents a scathing critique of the horrors of WWII, experienced first-hand while on the Manchurian front, and later on the Ryukyu Islands. While serving, as a statement of dissent against war, he refused any promotion and remained a private until he was taken prisoner by the U.S. He spent one year in a prison camp before returning to the business of film making, in 1946, until 1952 as an assistant director under Keisuke Kinishita.In Japan, Seppuku is the formal term for ritual suicide by disembowelment. Harakiri, as it is known in the West, is the common term, which literally means ""stomach cutting."" It was an integral part of bushido, the code of conduct of the samurai warrior class. Seppuku was ordered by a superior as punishment to redeem some offence, or chosen over a dishonorable death at the hands of an enemy. In both cases, it demonstrated the honor, courage, loyalty, and high moral character of the individual. Except when performed on a battlefield, it was a very formal ceremony, requiring certain etiquette, witnesses and considerable preparation.Harakiri is a particularly painful and rather messy way of ending one's days. In this ritual, the ""performer"" opens his abdomen, starting from left to right and then finishing from top toward bottom. But there is so need to be left for hours contemplating one's entrails. Another swordsman acting as a ""second,"" called kaishakunin, is standing by to decapitate the departing at a pre-arranged moment in the ceremony. Lord Ieyasu Tokugawa, who founded Japan's last great shogunate dynasty in 1603, ordered the practice of harakiri to be discontinued by both secondary and primary retainers. Later on, in 1663, a stronger edict from Lord Nobutsuna Matsudaira of Izu, put an end to the practice altogether. By that time, the ritual had become an idle formalism, and the ""performer"" was decapitated at the instant he took his sword out of the scabbard, thus avoiding a painful death. In some instances, the sword was replaced by a fan.Hanshiro Tsugomo (Tatsuya Nakadai) comes to the castle of the Iyi Clan to seek revenge for the humiliation and cruel death of his son-in-law, Anjiwa Motome (Akira Ishihama). Kobayashi is a superb storyteller, and in a slow and deliberate rhythm, he develops his story, which could have been taken from the pages of the Iliad or of the Mahabharata. The tension grows, as the Clan members slowly realize that they are in turn being humiliated by this stranger who truly believe in the samurai code of honor: he must be terminated to prevent him to broadcast his truth.The final duel with the master swordsmen of the Clan, Hikukuro Omodaka, on the Plains of Gojin-in, is like a meditation, a ballet of death. The film ends in a spectacular combat, and the coup de grace to Hanshiro Tsugomo's seppuku is fittingly not applied by a gallant swordsman, but a cowardly platoon of muskets. Even to the end, the samurai honor code has been violated by the Clan.As Toshiro Mifune has long been associated with the success of Kurosawa's films, so are Kogayashi's films enhanced by the brilliant interpretation of Tatsuya Nakadai (also staring in the leading roles in Kurosawa's ""Kagemusha"",and ""Ran""). This outstanding actor contributed further to the success of this director's films, ""Kwaidan"" and the ""Samurai Rebellion."" The screenplay by Shinobu Hashimoto is based on a novel by Yasuhiko Takiguchi The cinematography, by Yoshio Miyajima, in black and white, is gorgeous. Many on the shots are ""haiku-like"" in the imagery. The musical score, written for an ensemble of ancient instruments and percussion by the renowned classical composer Toru Takemitsu, is used sparingly throughout the film, reinforcing the dramatic moments.Masaki Kobayashi's film is an indictment of the hypocrisy of the establishment, any establishment, would it be in feudal 17th Century Japan or in any other time. Dogma, on which the establishment's authority rests, is evil. The established, codified order, with all its smoke and mirrors, must be preserved at all costs, and nothing must be allowed to come in its way. It is the duty of each member of any government, organization, church, or brotherhood not to spare any effort and to go to any length to protect the appearances and status quo, to achieve this essential goal of survival. The end justifies the means, and no lie or deceit can be eliminated if this survival is at stake.Although taking place almost five centuries ago during the Tokugawa Shogunate, this film is also a strong denunciation of the entrenched cultural legacy of coercive rituals, blind obedience, and chauvinism that resulted in the tragedy of the Pacific War.The outstanding screenplay, the superb acting, the cinematography and editing makes ""Harakiri"" the best samurai film ever."
"Harakiri is about two hours and fourteen minutes of uncontaminated mystery/ suspense-driven domination. This samurai classic capers abroad its tale unlike anything else in cinematic existence, bleeding its reveals through evoking flashbacks, heated, verbal narratives, and hairsplitting symbolic portraits.I didn't expect Harakiri to be such a bold stance on the hypocritical flaws hidden among the ancient Japanese warrior traditions. It's beyond praiseworthy. Additionally, the closing battle's deviant, ingeniously choreographed ramification will have you and any other witness unreservedly floored. (Verdict: A)"
"Little did I know that when my teacher said that this movie would be one of the best, if not the best, movies I have ever seen, that he would be telling the truth. I thought the movie was great. I thought `Hara-kiri' was very well written and well developed. I originally thought I was in for another Asian samurai movie filled with sword swinging, kung fu action, but it was so much more than that. It was a movie that shined a light on Japanese traditions and the hypocrisy of those in authoritative places. I really enjoyed the movie. It was one of those movies that if you fell to sleep on it or weren't paying attention you couldn't just fall back in line and think you could still follow the story. There was so much going on that you just wanted to give it all your attention. I enjoyed it because even though it `Die Hard' action packed, it still captured you. To one who knows that `hara-kiri' refers to suicide, you would probably assume that the movie would be grim and coarse. However, it was absolutely the opposite. It was a movie that really helped me to appreciate the strong and noble traditions of ancient Japan."
"In 1630, after a long period of peace in Japan after the end of the clans, thousand of samurais do not have masters and are living in absolute poverty. The ronin Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai) and former samurai of Lord of Geishu arrives at the house of Lord Lyi requesting a spot to commit hara-kiri (an honorable form of suicide through self-inflicted disembowelment followed by decapitation under the samurai code).Tsugumo is received by Umenosuke Kawabe (Yoshirô Aoki), who tells the story of the young samurai Motome Chijiiwa (Akira Ishihama) that arrived at the house also asking for a place to commit hara-kiri but expecting to receive coins instead. The warrior Hikokuro Omodaka (Tetsurô Tanba) convinces the clan to force Chijiiwa to really commit suicide using his bamboo blade as an example to other samurais that would appear using the same pretext to receive coins from the master.Tsugumo discloses that the lad Chijiiwa was his son-in-law that was forced to the situation expecting to raise some money to treat his sick wife and baby son. Further, Tsugumo had arrives in the house expecting to die not committing suicide, but revenging Chijiiwa, his daughter and his grandson.""Harakiri"" is a heartbreaking and tragic story of poverty and revenge in a period when Japan was ruled by the Tokugawa clan and thousand of samurais lost their work with the fall of the clans. This film is a little masterpiece based on the wealthy history and culture of Japan and the screenplay uses flashbacks and gives an explanation of this period of story for those that do not have a minimum knowledge of the history of Japan. The Internet is a useful tool to understand the big picture of this historical moment.The acting is top-notch and the cinematography in black and white is magnificent. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): Not Available"
"I have seen 6,035 motion pictures in my life. I have seen many of these more than once. I am not boasting. Nor am I proud that not only have I spent so many years of my life in front of a flickering screen but that I actually know the number of films that I have seen.With that said, ""Seppuku"" (""Hara-kiri"") makes that whole trip worth while. For every hundred pieces of celluloid tripe you can be fortunate to find a diamond in the rough and for me that was my first experience with this Kobayashi masterpiece. Pure enjoyment, pure excitement.The film is brilliantly constructed and multi-layered in such a way that the film defies genre classification. To call it a ""samurai film"" is akin to categorizing ""Psycho"" as a murder mystery. ""Seppuku"" could easily slide into the mystery, suspense, drama, or western genres and feel right at home. Perhaps an eastern film noir, if you will.Kobayashi's telling of the tale incorporates elements of despair, tradition, fortitude, revenge but mostly love, pride and honor in a grand visual style.The story's setting, direction and Tatsuya Nakadai's strong performance invite the inevitable comparison to Kurosawa and his favorite samurai Toshiro Mifune. All are of such high merit that I would propose ignoring the temptation to compare and appreciate the genius involved in ""Seppuku"".For those who have not seen ""Seppuku"" of course I strongly recommend that you do so but I also suggest that you avoid reading any synopsis and take delight in watching the tale unfold.10/10 (and not too many of the 6,035 are 10's)"
A complete masterpieces. Not a single flaw. 10/10. Such a great story with characters and ooooooof that ending
"Seppuku or harakiri is a samurai ritual where an elderly samurai cuts his belly open with a small sword and makes a cross in his flesh. After cutting other samurai cuts his head of to end the pain. And like this a samurai will die honorably.Seppuku tells a story of one elderly samurai named Hanshiro Tsugumo who has lots of things to tell before his harakiri. He tells a story about his beautiful daughter and her life. You can tell that the other samurais aren't actually very pleased with his story telling because the man just doesn't know when to stop. When Hanshiro finally finishes his stories there won't be his harakiri. No, then a great battle will begin. The influence of Seppuku in modern cinema is obvious. The final battle sequence is lot like in Kill Bill vol.1. And that's not the only thing that is similar to some movies of this date.Tatsuya Nakadai does great job in Hanshiro's role and the rest of the cast aren't bad either. Visual aspects of Seppuku are beautiful and the movie itself is very tough provoking. Well it's hard for me to put all into words because of the language barrier but I'll just say this: Seppuku is amazingly deep and beautiful movie which criticizes the mindless samurai ritual they call harakiri. I'm sorry I can't say much - after all I am young and Finish so English doesn't come so naturally for me. But It's easy for me to say - go and watch Seppuku, it's truly a great movie.Now it's time for me to watch other movies of Masaki Kobayashi."
"What a movie! I watched it knowing nothing but its title, and I think this was good for me. There is no point writing anything about the plot, actually two reviews (including IMDb's one) I read afterward reveal too much of it. I think the director would like to create a progressive change to the viewer's attitude concerning ""honor"" and ""moral"". Being Black&White and almost theatrical, it leads you to think rather than watch enchanted by the picture. It is not really a samurai action film, neither a film like ""Hero"" or ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (both of which I liked so much, for different reasons), although some scenes have common elements. I know not everybody will like it, it is a bit slow and also cruel but it has a point for both. The picture was a little blur at times, but I don't know if it was the film's or the cinema's fault. Anyway, it's a 42-year-old film, so that's better than we can expect!During the intermission,I was wondering which century I live in, so much was I incorporated in the atmosphere! PS. Do Japanese people really talk with their mouth almost closed?"
"Now while I've seen way more than my share of great Japanese samurai flicks, this is the only one I've seen so far that delves head-long into the Japanese culture of ""perfection"", honor, code and family. As the main character tells his story you feel more for his pain than nearly Kurosawa movie. For years, I thought Akira Kurosawa was the end all for truly great cinema, but after seeing Kobayashi's opus in Seppuku, it is obvious that 1960's Japanese Cinema had two masters.Seppuku is certainly one of those flicks that makes you say ""Oh SH*T"" halfway through. A deep and enriching story that just keeps getting better as more of the movie is revealed to you. While it doesn't reveal itself to you in a normal unraveling, but rather with a wonderfully told and filmed flashback (while admiringly very long and drawn out - even characters in the film call it so).Everything from the beautiful camera work to the acting delivery is absolutely superb. The close-ups within the flick actually deliver a wealth of information about the scenes that spoken words could only touch on. Truly a masterpiece and worth the wait from Netflix."
"This movie transcends Japan and Samurais. It's superb and brilliantly put in the screen. The acting is so well done, the plot surprinsingly draws you in and the music absolutely on spot. Really enjoyed it and the universally inspiring and cruel message it shows."
"First i must state that english isn't my mother language (so sorry for grammatical mistakes), but this film in my journey to the Top 250 really captivated me. A good revenge history like this is always satisfying to be watched, doesn't matter if it is japanese, in black and white or from 50 years ago. The characterization is amazing, the quality of the filming and especially the ending make this movie worth to be for many years in the top 250 no matter how many advances in special effects today and tomorrow a good history will live forever."
"An ethically & morally complex tale of honour, beliefs & all things bushido that's crafted with composure, narrated with patience & is steered by a measured lead performance, Harakiri calmly contemplates on ethics, morality, injustice, poverty & desperation to both celebrate the samurai code as well as lay bare the hypocrisy of the feudal system of its depicted era. One of Japanese cinema's most essential works, this period piece still packs a punch and lives up to the hype for the most part."
"Harakiri is one of the most underrated and astonishing Japanese films in history. While many consider Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai to be the greatest Samurai film in history, many true enthusiasts believe this honour belongs to Kobayashi's Harakiri. A film which has not received as much attention due to its limited release in North America, is now gaining attention due to its tremendous criterion collection release.It is an astounding masterpiece telling the story of an aging samurai on his quest to commit Seppuku (Harakiri). With storytelling and cinematography light years ahead of its time, it is difficult to leave this movie without a greater love for film and the filmmaking process. One of the few movies that will truly give you a full appreciation for the Samurai art form. An astonishing masterpiece is every sense of the word."
"Unlike all the Kurosawa films I've seen, this one has a principal protagonist that announces his intention early in the story and then takes the viewer on a stunning journey of revenge that's entirely unexpected. Director Masaki Kobayashi prepares the viewer with a preliminary accounting of the fate of thousands of unemployed Samurai as a result of the 17th Century dissolution of the Japanese Shogunate. Masterless Samurai, or ronin, appear at the doorstep of a feudal lord requesting a place in which to perform ritual suicide, but for the dishonorable, this effort is merely a ploy to accept some small token of monetary value before moving on. ""Harakiri"" tells the story of two such ronin, and until we learn the true relationship of both men to each other, the viewer is at a loss to understand the real motivation of Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai). With frequent forays into the past utilizing a series of flashbacks, Tsugumo relates the story of his son-in-law, helpless in the face of his wife's deteriorating physical condition and unable to seek medical attention for their sick baby due to lack of resources. What I found quite clever about the story was the absence of the three men Tsugumo called for to be his seconds for the purpose of hara-kiri. One realizes that it can't be simple coincidence that none of these men are available, as the story swerves to a desperate climax that pits Tsugumo against the entire House of Iyi. What would have been a tremendous let down in the story is avoided when Tsugumo follows through on his original mission, unable to physically overpower all the retainers employed by the clan's Master. So many films have the story's hero defeat an overwhelming number of rival opponents that it reduces the credibility factor to zero. At the point Tsugumo knows he can no longer pursue a fight strategy, he takes his life in the ritual manner. For followers of Japanese cinema, this film is a must see, with it's emphasis on honor, loyalty and embracing the truth of one's convictions. Tsugumo's unselfish final act unmasks the hypocrisy of the feudal lord's position, and mocks the cowardice of it's counselor Saito (Rentarô Mikuni). An appropriate amount of swordplay attends the story without becoming excessive, allowing for the more subtle aspects of Tsugumo's strategy to take over the narrative, which it does in compelling fashion."
"Harakiri is a classic tale of the Samurai, or in this case the Ronin. Masaki Kobayashi does an extraordinary job of incorporating western elements along with typical Japanese humor and vengeance, to deliver one of the key Jidai-Geki films in the history of Japanese cinema. The central idea of the film is to expose the audience to the egotistical, dishonorable side of the samurai, and does so by following Hanshiro (the protagonist) as he calls out the Iyi Clan for disobeying the Bushido Code. Samurai's live off honor, but in a world full of war and violence, this film proves that all morals and honor can be lost, and reveals the sick ways that people go about getting a form of entertainment."
"This has to be the best movie I have seen in a while. Good luck to me that I would like to pass on to you.We have two warring narrators. The first begins the film as an entry in his journal as local governor of a wealthy country estate. The film is closed with him finishing his entry, some days later. This official narrative deviates from what we see at the end.His story: one, then a second unattached ronin appeal to commit suicide in their courtyard. The first of these it is plain is just looking to be paid to leave, but our narrator is very strict about cleaving to that ronin's story. If he says he wants to kill himself, well then he must. This poor man had sold his sword and was now carrying bamboo, and it is this that he was forced to use. The resulting death is disturbing.So midway in the film, we have a samurai who has suffered because he was forced to live his story, forced by the narrator-governor who we later watch not live the story he has created and instead change it to suit.Now along comes an older samurai with the same request. He is dealt with in the same manner, but insists on telling a story to the assembled household before killing himself. He tells an amazing story: a fall from grace of his master, the dissolution of the household, poverty. His frail daughter and her son lay dying without a few coins for a doctor. The man's son is his daughter's husband, and it is he that came and was forced to die. The wife and son do as well, shortly after. Details of that death were told by the governor to the elder samurai earlier, though known because of the mocking way the body was returned.Until now, we have a classic case of warring narrative. We have the captive audience assembled. One storyteller is an official, so much so that he controls the official version of the film's story. The other has power in his gritty, true story. That story, incidentally is very close to what I consider noir: a random innocent fellow is cast in circumstances that seem full of circumstance and accident. The events of his life are played out not as they would in real life but as they would in a fictional life in a story told by others.Truth versus power in a struggle for the story of the film, essentially a struggle for the allegiance of the outer audience: us.The two beings as they face off are perfect in small mannerisms belying tension.Then slowly, the governor's world explodes as we learn new bits of the elder ronin's story of recent events. Many die.We (the audience) and control of all the cinematic effects was won by the ronin. Our governor is seen at the end writing the official account to be seen by his master that for his safety eradicates all story on both sides. The main actor, the winner, features in some of Kurosawa's best work as well."
"While Japanese movies are synonymous to Akira Kurosawa and Toshiro Mifune, this movie has neither of them. It's an unprecedented movie that leaves you brood over the plight of the once-great-warriors of the medieval Japan. The movie is aided by brilliant handling of the camera and loud yet powerful background music. The duel between Tsugumo and Omodaka set in the backdrop of plains with bushes ruffling against the gale was the most impressive scenes in the movie.Samurais, warriors known for their fighting skills and adept wielders of sword, are unemployed and are forced to live in penury after their clans make truce. They even struggle to get a job with workers demanding samurais not be employed. They resort to threatening other clans by saying they'd perform ancient religious practice of Hara-kiri, which is to disembowel oneself, if they are not awarded with a bounty.One such samurai Tsugumo offers his life to the Lyi clan. He's enlightened with the story of a man who gave exactly the same details as Tsugumo. They narrate the story of a certain Motome, who was so poverty-stricken that he had a bamboo instead of a blade and performs the practice in the most atrocious fashion. Motome's sacrifice served as an example to all those samurais who seek fortune in the name of intimidation to end one's life. Tsugumo confesses he was willing to perform hara-kiri whole-heartedly bu wishes his head be slashed by a great warrior of the clan. The warrior is ill and Tsugumo suggests two more names and all the three men have taken ill. The head of the clan senses Tsugumo's plot to procrastinate. Tsugumo wishes to narrate his story before it's time to enter the other world.He concedes that he and Motome were acquainted. Motome was his son-in-law, who taught in the neighborhood to earn a living. Stricken by poverty and an ailing wife and neonate son in the house, he fails to find a job and even sells his priced sword to earn a little money. He then heads to the Lyi clan to implore for the money but he's forced into performing Hara-kiri. Without medication and care, Tsugumo's daughter and grandson pass on. Tsugumo enlightens the men of the clan what actually happened to the men who responsible for his son-in-law's death in a way. An exasperated head orders Tsugumo be severed by the swords and pierced by spears. Tsugumo resists for a while, takes the life of 4 and lacerates 8 others before he dies.The head of the clan orders the 3 absentees be killed by skilled men and cover up all the killings in the name of illness thereby receiving appreciation from the administration.A 10/10 movie."
"Brilliant!  Harakiri is a movie worth buying.  If you love films, of any genre you have to see this one at least once (it's characters and story are that universal).  Although set during the twilight of the samurai era, Harakiri has  a story which can shake the norms of any modern culture anywhere in the world.  The secure but lonely life of an old warrior and his daughter are like a house built on sand and when the wind of change blows there is a stench from the  injustice and apathy from other samurai who stilll sleep in the illusion of their usefulness.   And no, this film is not about revenge, swords and just killing, in fact the action is so concentrated and sudden it's role is to  jar the audience out of the spell the director and actors and actresses cast and screams ""this is it, it's the end, it's real, and you'll remember every second forever'."
"A masterpiece. There you have a story, you have twists, you have tension. And although the movie is old and there are no special effects other than some blood it's still technically better than the over-done products like Matrix or whatever. Here you... have a clean three dimensional view of the scene both as a figure of speech but also visually the film is 3D. Can't remember one of the recent productions that have a camera that could compare to this one. No CGI and still gives a strong feeling of space and of the restrains of that given space. A masterpiece from all points of view. With a story about how not all things are what they seem to be.Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch"
"Do not get me wrong Seven Samurai is great, but this movie captivated me from start till end. It seems slow-paced, but most of the dramas do. This feeling goes away as the atmosphere just overhelms me.
The OST is on another level, enjoyed every note of it. The movie is absolute classic, and deserve to be in top 250."
"What is more dishonorable, out of work Samurai (Ronin) asking a clan to commit hara-kiri in their courtyard out of a desire to gain employment, with no intention of committing the act, or those in houses being cruel to them? When the country dishonors its Samurai, and they are driven to acts of desperation, leading to cruelty and further dishonor, the country spirals, and this movie set in 17th century seems to reflect decline in then present day (1962) Japan.The movie is quite beautiful visually, with traditional Japanese architecture and at one point a swaying bamboo forest framed beautifully by director Masaki Kobayashi. The story is taut and works on many levels, first and foremost as a vengeance with honor tale, which might remind you of an American Western, including a couple of epic battle scenes. It also has the individual man, disillusioned and saying that the Samurai code he lives by is a façade, and yet acting honorably, against a multitude misled by corrupt leaders. It's one against many in a battle that is timeless and certainly relevant today, and whose results are sadly akin to the entropy of the universe. ""Who can know the depths of another man's heart?"" the Samurai asks, signaling a need for empathy. Indeed."
"The first shot of Harakiri is an imposing suit of samurai armour, seated on a bench amongst cinematic coils of smoke in the air. I say seating, because despite its hollowness, it's posture is imposingly life-like, almost as if at the call of war it would come to life and march off to battle. This must be how the Ii clan see this glorious suit of armour; even in peacetime it is more than just a tool for means of driving back enemies, but a symbol for honour, strength, loyalty and absolute morality. Of course as they prosper, the peacetime has released many ronin, now master-less and without a trade or living, into the wild wandering. This is really a film for a repeat watch. On first impression, Motome's pleas seem a little self-fulfilling, because why would a samurai committed to seppuku want a two day respite if they have renounced everything and are ready to die? His actual act of seppuku too, is extremely hard to watch - Kobayashi doesn't need to show actually graphic penetration because Ishihama's agony is so anguishing to witness. And yet, there is a hint of comeuppance, because it seems phony that a samurai would carry around a fake, bamboo version of his livelihood. On a second watch, these scenes are filled with such a tragic desperation once we know the back-story. The blunt, ironic cruelty of the bamboo strikes becomes heartbreaking because he has already sold his real blades for his family - what is a samurai without his blade? We know without a doubt he would return in two days this time. Doubly so, Hanshiro weeps because he has kept his own blade, foolishly holding onto a past relic much like the witnesses around him do so. Kobayashi has maintained such a steady, tense rhythm throughout the two hours and 13 minutes. Not once is there a line of misplaced dialogue, or a glance that was not filled with the appropriate amount of venom. We see one 'extortion' attempt, and then another from Hanshiro, so of course we await some sort of twist or connection. There is no sense of contrivance when he delays the act, no sense of artificial direction behind these characters. Tatsuya Nakadai is effortless. He has the knack for transforming so seamlessly into his character and becoming every ounce of them - here it is in his blank, almost traumatised expression as he narrates; it could not be more immediately obvious that this is a man who has lost everything. And then there is the little remaining spark underneath that drives this tale of revenge (his cackles as he bemusedly wonders on the fate of three men he has already taken care of), although it seems more vital to expose the Ii clan for the facade that they uphold. The framing device of the narration of the guest book is what seals it. It simultaneously empowers and suppresses the events of the film; even as we witness the despair of Saito, having his pretense so viciously and comprehensively demolished, he quickly rewrites the history books because he has that power (there's a cruel irony to the way he orders the forced seppuku of the three disgraced warriors - the noble ritual being marred). That stirring, dramatic duel in the windswept plains, gone. That desperate, climatic battle, where we might conventionally expect a one-man massacre and a little poetic justice, gone. And even as he attempts to go out on his own terms, Hanshiro is shot by a modernised death-dealer. It recalls Kurosawa's Yojimbo, in which it was actually Nakadai who wielded the gun and brought forth the end of the age of samurai. But here, it becomes a more potent, universally symbolic end. This cruel world does not bend to sentiment. Appearances must be upheld, even sometimes in the face of moral transgression. Hanshiro smashes the suit of armour, but it is gleaming and whole again soon. But it is of course a hollow ideal. All the honour in the world could not materialise a decent man to fill its shoes."
"Samurai films, like westerns, need not be familiar genre stories. They can expand to contain stories of ethical challenges and human tragedy. 'Harakiri', a shining example of the kind, is about one samurai who takes his time to create an unanswerable dilemma for the elder of a powerful clan. By playing strictly within the rules of Bushido Code which governs the conduct of all samurai, he lures the powerful leader into a situation where sheer naked logic leaves him humiliated before his retainers.The story is set in a time when feudal Japan is at peace, and starving out-of-work samurai beg to perform ritual suicide or 'hara-kiri' at the mansions of powerful clans - a request they hope will lead to a charitable pittance or a menial job. One such lone ronin arrives at the temple of Lord Iyi and asks to use the courtyard to perform honorable ritual self-disembowelment, hara-kiri or seppuku. That seems like the beginning and the end of this movie, all in one: a checkmate. But director Masaki Kobayashi instead constructs a masterful chess game, filled with many carefully constructed moves, each arranged to fit in a particular place - it's glorious to behold!Thus, it would be foolish to give away too much. But the ronin Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai) has chosen this particular temple for a very grievous personal reason. His hara-kiri is postponed when, kneeling on the white-sheeted death platform, he requests one after another, three separate house retainers serve as seconds to cut off his head. All three so indisposed as to be unable to attend, the ronin then begs a moment of time to tell his story. Like a brilliant player, he leaves out crucial details until the most opportune moments.The movie openly depicts vanity and corruption among the samurai class, showing that the Lord is more concerned with his reputation than with actual samurai honor. The film has a steady, hypnotic momentum; Kobayashi, wrings as much drama out of facial twitches as he does out of sword fights which are all elegantly composed and photographed to reflect the values it contains. He's helped immensely by Nakadai's molten central performance and the spare, disquieting music. Using superb architectural compositions, Mr. Kobayashi achieves a sort of visual mesmerization that is suitable to the curious nightmare mood.In the end, ""Harakiri"" goes well beyond the usual genre trappings to beautifully underline its recurring theme - that fanatic adherence to codes of honor, by granting them a value greater than life itself, sets up a situation where humanitarian values are forbidden."
"It's 1630. There is peace in the land and many samurai have become poor homeless vagrants. Hanshiro Tsugumo is a samurai whose clan has fallen. He comes to the home of a feudal clan to ask permission to commit seppuku within the courtyard. Kageyu Saito is a senior counsel and he tries to deter the man with the story of another ronin Motome Chijiiwa from the same clan. They forced him to do the job despite he has sold his blade. All he has is a blade made of bamboo. It's a brutal painful event. Nevertheless, Hanshiro insists on continuing with his seppuku and then he reveals that he did indeed know Motome.The first recollection is actually quite compelling. It catches my attention culminating in one of the most memorable horrific scenes. The rest of the movie can't really compare. It's another series of recollections and it's not as compelling. I think it would be just as good to compress the second half and keep the big final fight."
"First of all let me tell u guys what exactly is Harakiri.It is also known as Seppuku in Japan.Harakiri is a form of Japanese ritual suicide by disembowelment.It is reserved only for samurai.I saw this movie few days back and i must say am surprised how well this movie is made,everything is just perfect from story to acting.This story shows the ugly truth of life.It shows sometimes man can go and do anything for the sake of the family and sometimes the family is the only thing he got and once lost the will to live also gets away. It shows whatever the traditions are good or bad but family is the most important thing in life.It shows some traditions managed by bad leaders can come to very bad endings.I would recommend this movie for everyone and am sure u will like this classic samurai flick."
"While being an important part of Japanese film, this movie keeps the viewer attached to their seat throughout the whole movie. Its intense action scenes and great acting add to its authentic and captivating plot. It tells the story within an important time of Japanese history- the Tokugawa era. The viewer is able to see how it was to live in Japan during this era and the lifestyle in Japanese culture. It also conveys an important and inspiring lesson of honor, respect, betrayal, and morals. Its dramatic twists and revealing scenes make the film worth watching. The movie shows the life of ronins during the Tokugawa era and how it felt to leave behind the samurai life. The essence of samurai culture is presented in the film's theme and brings the viewer to a new understanding of this culture."
"Originally titled ""Seppuku,"" ""Harakiri"" is a 1962 Japanese film directed by Masaki Kobayashi. ""Harakiri"" is a narrative in nonlinear format, meaning that the order in which the film unfolds is not necessarily the order in which events transpired. I have no knowledge as to whether Tarantino has actually seen this film or cited as an influence, but it is easy to imagine this film as an influence of his, especially in relation to the nonlinear narrative, as well as the role Japanese cinema played on him.The protagonist of the film is Hanshiro, who is a ronin, or a samurai without a lord. The premise of the film is that Hanshiro travels to the house of the Ii clan, where he asks to perform seppuku, which is a type of suicide performed by samurai wherein the samurai disembowels himself with the intent of preserving his honor. The Ii clan's counselor, Saito, agrees to let Hanshiro perform seppuku. Saito tells Hanshiro of another ronin who came there wishing to perform seppuku before him. This is really where things get interesting. To preserve the viewing experience of readers who may not have seen the film yet, I will not delve into many details beyond the initial premise discussed above.""Harakiri"" is a film I would highly recommend. Essentially, the real message of the film is focused on the consequences of blinding following code or rules and the effect that that type of dogmatism can have. This is a film that will stick with you long after the initial viewing, so be prepared to question any beliefs you may hold afterwards."
"Mizoguchi does an excellent job at creating a strong willed character that will stop at nothing to expose dogmatic followings of the Bushido code as unnecessary and unethical. I admire Mizoguchi for going against his cultures beliefs in order to showcase his own for others. So often we are quieted by what our religion, parents, culture, etc. expect of us; we are never able to claim our own identity and beliefs in fear of rejection. Hanshiro, who is against the dogmatic version of the Bushido code, is ironically the one samurai who embodies the noble side of it above anyone else. I feel here Mizoguchi was trying to deliver the message that following your own beliefs and ""orders"" is far more valuable than following others orders. Anyone can be a dogmatic follower only a few can think freely and passionately enough to be a counterforce to wrong acts that are seen as societal norms. You can definitely feel that Mizoguchi was influenced by the French New way in terms of how he decides to tell the story—it's not particularly in chronological order. Instead it is a story that is told through a past story (Motome's experience). By telling both of these stories you can further understand what fueled Hanshiro to be the admirable rebel that he is."
"Masaki Kobayashi's ""Harakiri"" or ""Seppuku"" is filled with drama and suspense. Kobayashi decided to tell the story in a non-linear style with plenty of flashbacks. This allowed the viewer to remain on edge, filled with skepticism and anticipation throughout the film. This director has no limits. I don't think I have ever had such a reaction to blood and gore in a film as I did in Harakiri. It got me to my feet. I completely respect his decision to show those elements, as they were completely necessary. This choice commanded that the viewer recognize from the very beginning that this was not just a story of life and death but a tale with deeper meaning. Isolationism was the overall theme of this movie, and Kobayashi does a spectacular job of sticking to this. Whenever we see Hanshiro telling his story from the courtyard we are overwhelmed with this sense of isolation, an every man for himself type of feeling.Cinematically speaking, the choices made in this arena felt ironically inviting and apprehensive simultaneously. Kobayashi makes the choice to shoot the majority of the film at kneeling height or eye level, because that is where the majority of people remained throughout the entire film. It is really one of those films that leaves you questioning, which makes sense as the director was prominently known for questioning all things Japanese."
"This film is narrated by more than on e person. However the main character, Hanshiro, gets to tell his full story of how and why he got there to the Iyi Clan. There is suspicion from the beginning when he is asked if he really ants to perform harakiri or if he simply wants money or a job. The counselor asks him this and Hanshiro replies the same answer that his son in law, Motome, did when he came in search for an open hand. Through Hanshiro's story telling, we are able to see the true meaning for why he is there; revenge for his lost family. Althpugh his intention is not on killing them, he simply wants them to acknowledge the unethical way they went about with Motome. In the beginning of them movie, the Iyi Clan armor is depicted as honorable, brave and even a little frightening however after the plot uncovers how the samurai retainers acted, the armor becomes an insignificant and worthless statue."
"I really enjoyed this Film. You definitely need to know the historical background of Ancient Japan to understand the film. It takes place in a time where thousand of Samurai where out of work and thrown into poverty. It was very interesting to see another cultures perspective on honor and loyalty. I felt bad for the ronins that where poor and had no way to survive. Harakiri is a ritualistic suicide for Samurai in Ancient Japan. This is an honorable ritual. The film tends to jumps around in different points of view throughout the storyline, so make sure you pay attention. What I took away from this movie is that sometimes the traditional ways of respecting authority must be questioned, especially when it comes down to what you believe to be right or wrong."
"The way Masaki Kobayashi filmed this movie was unlike anything I've ever seen. At the beginning we are introduced to a young samurai who is now a ronin, Tsugumo Hanshirō, who comes to the house of the Iyi Clan asking permission to perform Harakiri on his property. The clan becomes very angry when they discuss whether they should let him or not, knowing that many ronin have gone to many clans asking to perform harakiri, with no intentions of doing so, but instead getting sent away with some money. Believing that young Hanshirō had no intention of harakiri, and just wanted money, they granted him his wish to preform the sacred act on their land. Now you can see how distraught Tsugumo looks, and we almost feel happy. They caught him in his shameful act, now making him commit suicide seems almost justifiable instead of downright cruel. Tsugumo begs them for just a day or two, he swears he'll come back but now the samurais are set on teaching this disgraceful samurai a lesson and won't let him leave, even when they discover his swords are wooden. It's shocking, but you feel the need to side with the Iyi Clan, believing what they did is justifiable. Then, as the story goes on, we come to realize Tsugumo came there as a last resort, looking for any way to save his dying wife and dying child. He sold his swords, an ultimate form of disgrace in this culture, to help feed them and take care of them. He would do anything for them, even risk his life and his honor. Showing us that even though samurais live and die by the Bushido code, there are things that take precedence over that, like family and love. This film is a great example of that, and was directed beautifully."
"This is a fantastic film that questions what honor truly means, and what it meant for the Samurai. It presents us with a rich and thrilling story that has us glued to our seats as we follow different Samurai through an unwinding mystery surrounding the death of a young Ronin.The film gives us a glimpse into the less than ideal lives of the Samurai, and shows us the truly human issues that they had to deal with, like family and loss, instead of simply showing battle scenes. The film is about the priorities that a man has to set for himself, and the conflicting values between the Bushido code, and the family life of a samurai.Through it's form of story structure, the film also teaches us to never judge a book by its cover, by changing who we perceived to be the protagonist originally. This structure, on top of the heavy issues that the film deals with, makes it an truly unforgettable journey."
"DO NOT READ IF U DIDN'T SEE THE MOVIEThe compelling tale of Seppuku, Masaki Kobayashi's visual masterpiece, takes place during the feudal era in seventeenth century Japan.  This film, as well as several other films directed by Kobayashi, was inspired by his own individual wartime experience.  Each of Kobayashi's works reverberate his passionate disdain of societal authority and political corruption. Kobayashi was an analytical mastermind because of his extraordinary ability to dispute the abuse of power clearly and sensibly.  Seppuku is the enigmatic story of how absolute power blinds those who possess it from seeing or believing a virtuous reality. The protagonist of the story is Hanshiro Tsugumo, an aged and unemployed samurai.  He had lost everything that had any value to him, so he journeyed to the House of Iyi, the mansion inhabited by a respected samurai clan, to perform harakiri, the Japanese ritual where a samurai living in shame commits suicide by  means of eviscerating oneself.  This is the most honorable type of death for this situation. Tsugumo arrived at the House of Iyi prepared to die.  The clan elder of the House of Iyi questioned Tsugumo's `true' motive because of  previous impoverished unemployed samurai who threatened to perform harakiri only to extort money from the wealthy clan.  The clan elder then told Tsugumo of a specific instance where this `dishonorable' behavior occurred. The clan elder told Tsugumo about the story of Motome Chijiiwa, in an attempt to uncover his `true' motive.  Chijiiwa, like Tsugumo, was a member of the disbanded Shogunate clan.  When the clan elder asked, `Did you know Chijiiwa?' Tsugumo gave no immediate answer.  The clan elder continued with his story and said that the clan forced Chijiiwa to perform harakiri even when he asked to be given a boon.  The most sickening aspect of Chijiiwa's death was that he had to perform harakiri with a sword made from bamboo, which meant his soul was worthless in the samurai culture because one's sword is one's soul. After the story Tsugumo was asked if he still wanted to perform harakiri. The unshaken Tsugumo did not waver in his decision to perform harakiri, but he first had to choose a second, a samurai that assists one in harakiri by cutting off one's head when their entrails are completely exposed . Coincidentally, out of three seconds, none were present that day at the House of Iyi.  Tsugumo requested that one of the three men that he had requested be summoned to accompany him for his performance of harakiri. While a group of clan members were summoning the three absent samurais, Tsugumo told the members of the House of Iyi the tragic incidents in his life that led him to want to perform harakiri. In this story Tsugumo revealed that he did know Motome Chijiiwa, he took care of him when Chijiiwa's father died.  Tsugumo treated him like a son. Years later, Tsugumo asked Chijiiwa to marry his precious daughter Miho. Chijiiwa reluctantly said yes to his mentor's proposal due to his financial state.  After Miho and Chijiiwa were married, they had a child.  Shortly after the child was born, Miho and the baby became extremely ill.  The family did not have enough money for a doctor, so they could not receive treatment.  Chijiiwa tried various ways of obtaining money, but  none worked.  Chijiiwa then traded in his precious sword for money to treat his wife and his son.  When Chijiiwa returned home, he told Tsugumo and Miho that he was going to journey to a moneylender in another city, and that he would return soon.  When he did not return, Tsugumo thought that Chijiiwa had left the burden of his ill daughter and grandson upon him. When three men from the House of Iyi came to Tsugumo's home with the body of Chijiiwa, the men indicated that Chijiiwa's life was meaningless due to his death by a sword of bamboo.  Shortly after this visit, Miho and her son died of sickness.  Tsugumo hunted down the men that visited him, and he cut off each of their ponytails.  He showed the ponytails to the clan elder to show that the honor of the House of Iyi meant nothing.  Disgusted by this display, the clan elder sent all of his men to attack Tsugumo.  He fought off many opponents, and destroyed many precious artifacts in the House of Iyi.  When he was about to perform harakiri, he was shot.  This action vividly portrayed that the House of Iyi, and possibly other houses, was corrupt and had no honor.  The disturbing ending showed all of the blood being cleaned up, and the false idols being restored and replaced.  The House of Iyi remained for many years after that isolated event."
"A brilliant showcase of well paced cinematic storytelling that will take you on an emotional ride of feeling anger, frustration, joy and sorrow. A true story about circumstances and the complexity of life."
"Greetings from Lithuania.""Harakiri"" (1962) is a great movie. It tells a simple at first look story, but later it becomes more layout and complicated then it looks. Acting was great as well as directing, cinematography and directing. This is also a sad movie, with tragic heroes and consequences.Overall, ""Harakiri"" is a great film. It tells a very sad story and its also a very good character study movie."
"Though the act of Seppuku, or ""Harakari"", was abolished in 1868, it was for a long time the true test of a samurai's honor and nobility. In Seppuku (1962), the ritual shows us humanity in its most raw and vulnerable form; perhaps, it is just before death when one's truest colors shine through. The film is a masterclass in portraying the human condition while showcasing some of the best cinematography and direction I've ever seen in a film. Literally every frame (with its perfect lighting, blocking and composition) is like a painting come to life, just perfect. Masaki Kobayashi paces this film perfectly and keeps you engrossed with one of the most beautiful and incisive pieces of human drama I've ever seen. Once the film receives about 1,000 or so more ratings on IMDb, you'll see this gem shoot up to the top 50 easily. It's truly one of the most beautifully crafted films ever made; What a masterpiece..."
"Harakiri truly explains to what extent a Samurai could go to protect their honor and loved ones, although very few of them can go to that extent.Masaki Kobayashi's vision of perfection made the movie very authentic. The performance of the actors, their attire, the background used in the scenes everything was perfect, and it felt like you have been taken to 18th century Japan."
"Pros:It's great at building tension.
The story is gripping and interesting.
Exciting action.
Fantastic acting.
I dont know a lot about 17th century Japan But i Can Imagine that it's very authentic either way it did a great job getting me into the world.
Every camera move feels unique and purposeful.
The way it sometimes doesnt show what we want to see just to let our imagination go wild.
The score is great.
Interesting characters that you care about and either want to see succeed or die.
It's very emotional at times.
Never boring.
Really good cinematography.
It has a very unique and interesting style.Cons:
I dont really have any complaints about the movieOverall:
This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
It's stylistic way of telling a already interesting story works extremly well.10/10"
Definitely the best samurai flick that was not done by Kurosawa! In fact it actually surpasses many of his masterpieces! The brilliant cinematography and intense swordplay is complimented by an intricate and well told story that stays with you.
"HARAKIRI is an action drama about an unfortunate fate and an ironic revenge of a ronin.A ronin arrives at an estate of one clan and says that he wishes to commit seppuku (hara kiri) within the courtyard of their palace. To deter him, a senior counselor tells him the story about a young ronin who is looking for a way to commit seppuku, but set of circumstances has made his death a slow, painful and humiliating. Despite this warning a poor ronin insists that he has never heard that story and says that he has no intention of leaving their palace alive. After a suicide pavilion is set up in the courtyard of the palace, the ronin is asked to name the samurai who shall behead him when the ritual is complete. Coincidentally, he has chose three samurai who have participated in the ritual of the unfortunate young ronin from the counselor's story. However, all three decline to come, saying they are suffering from a life-threatening illness. The ronin has laughed ironically and started his shocking confession...This is a very dramatic and tragic story with a very strong final climax. That ritualistic form of suicide is further reinforce the impression of a dark atmosphere. The main villain is a certain kind of a corrupt lord. A desperate and poor hero slowly serves his revenge, with the intent to humiliate and embarrass his opponents. An ancient tradition, political conflicts and shattered pride follow his painful confession. Mr. Kobayashi has enriched a tense situation with a vivid and sad retrospectives. The final battle is truly magnificent, even an occasional shred of theatricality has its role. Characterization is pretty good. Tatsuya Nakadai (Tsugumo Hanshirō) has offered an excellent performance as a desperate and poor, but focused and brave ronin.The brutality and an attack in the agony give us an entirely new expression of the ancient samurai world."
"This film was very well-made and the story is excellent. The story begins with a man asking his local warlord permission to commit ritual suicide. His reason is that the country has been at peace so long that ronin (out of work and master-less Samurai) have no income and nothing to do. So, instead of the indignity of just wasting away, a vicious and painful suicide is apparently the best option! Instead of instantly granting this request, the Counselor tells the suicidal ronin about a similar request that occurred recently and how the ronin who killed himself probably only asked for permission to die as a ruse to get money from the warlord! In other words, this other man had hoped that his request would NOT be granted and he would instead been given a small income. But, not wanting to see the Bushido code perverted, the warlord demanded that this man commit ritual suicide--even though the sword the ronin had was made of bamboo and doing the painful ritual was super-painful and difficult with such a sword.This story was pretty interesting but how it related to this second ronin is what makes this story so interesting. Plus, I loved how the story ended.Overall, I think this is a bit of an ""anti-Samurai"" film, as it talked how adherence to the rules of Bushido actually could be very cruel and violate the spirit of the feudal system. The inherent cruelty and desire to only worry about appearances instead of right and wrong make this an excellent and intriguing movie. Good stuff."
"American ethos has always had a soft-spot for the conscientious objector. We're a nation of fervent individualists and everything from the writings of Mark Twain to the film 12 Angry Men (1957) codifies that idea. The power of an individual against a torrent of common corruption and blind group-think is almost fetishized, especially in contemporary society. The Japanese, generally speaking, don't have such a provocative streak of individualism embedded in their culture. So it's interesting that one of the most eloquent and austerely beautiful films on the subject should come from the land of the rising sun. Harakiri is a repudiation of the collective values of Japan that, on its best days unites a population in tragedy and at its worst marches a people towards war.Hanshiro Tsugumo (Nakadai) is an aging and embittered samurai whose feudal lord has died in battle along with most of his men. In order to reclaim his honor, according to the bushido code, Tsugumo must disembowel himself in a ritual suicide known as seppuku. To do this he arrives at the feet of Saito Kageyu (Mikuni) and asks members of the Iyi daimyo to help him do the ceremony correctly. Kageyu is hesitant as only a few days ago a similar request was made by another ronin who had no intention of committing seppuku but was looking to extort the clan for money. After Kageyu retells the man's tale, which culminates in the ronin dying by the blade of a bamboo sword, Tsugumo insists his intentions are to die with honor. Yet as the pavilion where the deed is to be done is setup, questions remain. What is Tsugumo's connection to the earlier ronin? Why did he pick the courtyard of the Iyi clan out of all others? Finally does he really intent to reclaim his honor, or is there something else going on?Told in a dizzying array of flashbacks and flash-forwards, Harakiri is not a leisurely movie to watch while folding laundry. It demands the attention of the viewer and weaves a complex tale of Hanshiro Tsugumo's home life after the fall of his clan. He's stricken with the most dire poverty, contemplating his daughter's (Iwashita) sale as a concubine and working menial jobs just to get by. His daughter, son-in-law Motome (Ishihama) and infant grandson Kingo are his only solace from a life of dishonor. Their fates become intimately intertwined with Tsugumo and the Iyi clan in unexpected ways and paying close attention to the plot pays off stunningly in the end.In his own quiet and ultimately unsettling way director Masaki Kobayashi strips away the nobility and romanticism commonly associated with feudal Japan. While doing so he implicates the modern audience (at the time the Japanese public circa 1962) in tolerating authoritarianism under the guise of honor. Harakiri recalls and parallels the days of Japanese imperialism and uses a single individual as a means to take apart the misplaced hubris of anyone still beholden to the old guard. Kobayashi himself was drafted in the army during WWII but repeatedly refused promotion beyond that of a private; his own way of fighting corruption, hypocrisy and evil.The film comes to a conclusion so damning and memorable that I dare not ruin the satisfaction of watching it for the first time. Harakiri is an absolute treasure featuring a star turn by Nakadai who first made an indelible mark on Japanese screens in Kobayashi's The Human Condition Trilogy (1959-1961). Here, while playing a character much older than himself, he still has a certain inner- turmoil that channels James Dean with a strong baritone. Finally there's Kobayashi's masterful direction which watches pensively and almost perversely as the jigsaw pieces fall in place."
"I usually don't like samurai movies. Even Kurosawa doesn't do it for me. I just can't sink into their ways of life and the world of 17th century Japan. However, Masaki Kobayashi's Harakiri totally subverts and questions everything they stand for in a compelling way. It's a study of the human condition in samurai form, naturally from the director of the epic saga The Human Condition, of which I need to finish after being impressed by the first part. It's a dissection of the metaphysical ideas of honour that bind the traditions of these men. While they try to commit to formalities, in the face of conflict they find it impossible. The story unravels like a psychological thriller although it's largely formed of flashbacks and talking but the connections that are drawn and the way the film blossoms to its explosive final 15 minutes is extraordinary. A suicide narrative like this is difficult, what are the stakes and what are the motives? Harakiri keeps you guessing, thanks to the incredible performances and when you feel like you've got it figured out, the whole picture changes. With its stark widescreen cinematography and disconcerting score, its technical aspects bolster the experience. It's a film that works on all levels, Harakiri is certainly the best Japanese film I've seen so far.9/10"
"While ""Harakiri"" was not my first experience with Japanese history, culture or cinema, it was still an impacting and enlightening film. While ruthless in nature, ""Harakiri"" does a wonderful job in conveying the history of ancient Japan, samurais and the Bushido code. While some people's knowledge of samurais only extend as far as the Disney film, ""Mulan"", ""Harakiri"" sheds a great deal of light on the underlying meaning behind the truth, strength and honor of the code. With a protagonist that is both relentless and appealing, ""Harakiri"" delivers special performances all over the board. While it moves a bit slow, there is an undeniable enchantment about this film. The story, while heart-wrenching, is so well done that you come out of it rooting for more. It makes you question history and the way it's perceived, just as I'm sure Mr. Kobayashi intended. With engaging choreography and near-perfect consume and set design, ""Harakiri"" brings you to a place and time that you otherwise may not have known existed. Kobayashi does a wonderful job at conveying the internal struggle between all characters, men whom have an obligation to their families, and those who have one to their code. This film challenges all the elements of revenge, redefinition and ritual. A job very well done."
"I watched this movie in a film class at SMC, in California, and it really opened me up to this genre. Before watching it I had never watched a single Japanese samurai movie or anything related to it and I really enjoyed Hara-Kiri and how the Japanese culture was captured. Never would I think that a movie this slow would keep me alert and make me want to continue watching, it was almost what I believed made the movie so special, it's different from anything I have ever experienced. Fighting movies and movies about war in general are usually so brutal and extreme but this story takes its time, no rush and it makes it even more powerful!"
"I loved this movie. From the directing, the fight scenes, to the Seppuku scenes, it just amazed me. It is also one of the saddest movies I have ever watched.The only way you would not like this movie is if you cannot handle dialogue driven movies, and even then, I'd recommend you trying it. Its a bit long, but I did not get bored once during its entirety. To put it into perspective, I liked this movie much more than Shinchin No Samurai and Rashomon, those being the only two older Japanese movies I have witnessed.Go and see this movie as quickly as possible."
Fascinating tale of a desperate Samurai. What poverty can do to you & What is a pride of Samurai?? This movie has told these tales.
"A really impressive study on the hypocrisy of the samourai code.It has good acting, katana fighting, amazing camera. A perfect movie."
I really like the story within a story style of storytelling. It has really cool cinematography and dialogue. It's intense and pretty captivating. It teaches a lot about the Japanese samurai culture of the time. It also has good acting and cool fighting sequences.An unemployed and poor samurai goes to a clan's mansion to request to perform harakiri in their courtyard. But turns out he has a relationship with the previous samurai who came for the same purpose.
"To tell the truth I'm kind of stretching at the 9 because ""Seven Samurais"" has to be at least worth 2 more. The story is spell binding and hooked me completely to feudal Japan and the Samurai way. The smugness exhibited by the Samurai toward the Ronin had you hating on them from the beginning. I absolutely loved it and thank god I found it on YouTube before they deleted it. It's great!"
"Social criticism on the samurai culture during the Tokugawa Government of the 1600s , when the Shogunate were disbanding samurai clans and many were left wandering in poverty. The beginning of the merchant era , during a time of peace , and samurai were no longer necessary for society. This film questions samurai traditions and the integrity behind them: the rise of lawlessness among wandering samurai (taking advantage of dojo's kindness during peace era), not having a proper sword for seppuku, allowing or not a day or two for reconciliation with one's loved ones before seppuku, biting off one's tongue, the rise pf merchants impoverishing the people, the importance of top-knots, and the meaning of God in Shogun armor. This movie takes stab at all samurai practice with a moral compass between right and wrong. Not matter what social faction we belong to , in the end we are all human which transgresses all"
"Kobayashi making a superb Samurai film in the early '60s is like David Vs. Goliath. Kurosawa was on top of his game at this time, and somehow Masaki Kobayashi managed to create a Samurai film on par with the quality of Kurosawa, while staying true to his own style and merit instead of copying what others did before him.The first thing that struck me was that this film, more than 50 years later, still looks fantastic. Especially the great use of high contrast lighting, something you barely see in Japanese productions, set the tone both visually and thematically. The director of photography uses a lot of symmetric shots which look beautiful but tell a story as well. For me the highlight of this film was Motome Chijiiwa's seppuku. This scene was shocking, absurd and also very unpredictable. Excellent editing and cinematography created an unforgettable, yet uncomfortable moment. The turn of events, which slowly unfold as the film progresses is unexpected and will surprise you. But most of all, it will impress you. The director uses some very (without giving too much away) notable techniques to strengthen the effect.Tatsuya Nakadai, one of the greats in Samurai cinema, has some of the most amazing body language you will ever see in movies! I noticed how much work and detail he put into this character by not focusing on his eyes, but rather on his feet - which show that he really is portraying a Samurai. My only flaw is that the beginning of the film, the first twenty minutes or so, does not set the tone which I found to be a bit confusing and off putting.This is one of the greatest films from the golden age of Japanese cinema. It holds up very well and you will walk away very satisfied. If you get the chance, go watch it!"
"The concept of ritual suicide in the form of Harakiri, otherwise known as Seppuku, has captivated western imaginations for centuries. Indeed, the very notion of suicide, for religious or social reasons is viewed with a feeling of disdain within the western mindset. However, ritual suicide held an important ceremonial role for members of the Samurai class in ancient Japan. Viewed as an important component of the Samurai's Bushido warrior code, Harakiri was often used as a punishment but was often done voluntarily as well. It was a matter of honor and upheld the tradition of the warrior code. Harakiri forces the audience to confront the brutality of such a tradition and questions the morality of it. During the film, the main character questions both Bushido and the authenticity of the warrior code. He asserts that Bushido is a mere facade rather than a symbol of discipline. Whether or not these assertions are true, is a question that Harakiri leaves for the audience to decide.During the Edo period of the Tokugawa shogunate in Japan, it was common for master less samurai who were known as Ronin to request to commit harakiri in the palace of feudal lords.In this tradition, a man who goes by the name of Tsugumo Hanshirō requests to commit suicide at a powerful feudal lord's courtyard. Masaki Kobayashi directed this film to start out slow with the old man Hanshirō narrating a story. The story is about how the powerful clan at the courtyard was responsible for the death of Hanshirō's entire family. The old man confronts the powerful feudal clan in such a calm and authoritative manner that the audience is left at the edge of their seats. Hanshirō's daughter was married to a poor Samurai that was so destitute that he had to sell his blade to care for his family. He has a young baby who unfortunately gets sick and becomes desperately in need of medicine. When Hanshirō's son in law came to the Li clan seeking alms for medicine, they chose to punish him for disgracefully giving up his Samurai sword by forcing him to disembowel himself in the Seppuku fashion using the only sword he had left: a dull bamboo katana. After covering the dramatic backstory, the movie masterfully builds up to the final conclusion where Hanshirō uses every last ounce of his Samurai abilities to fight his way into the feudal lord's compound to desecrate his hall. The sheer force of will and determination displayed by Hanshirō's character on-screen is a testament to the acting abilities of Tatsuya Nakadai.Despite being shot in black and white, the film is aesthetically appealing as it depicts idyllic Japanese villages and sword fights in Samurai graveyards. At the climax of the film, the greatest line of the film is spoken. Before the culminating final sword battle, the main character proudly proclaims, ""Motome had indeed gone mad. But I say good for him! I praise him for it. He may have been a samurai, but he was a man of flesh and blood. He could not live on air alone. When he has reached the point of no return, even a man as strong as Motome will go mad trying to protect his family, and I would praise him for it. They'll call him the bamboo ronin. Not only samurai, but townspeople, too, will scoff at his wavering. But let them laugh all they want. Who can fathom the depths of another man's heart?""."
"Jonathan Sessums `Samurai code exposed' Set in 17th-century Japan, director Masakaki Kobayahi's Harakiri (1963) stars Tatsuya Nakadai, as masterless samurai Hanshiro Tsugumo. Kobayashi's gives a horrifying display of assault on the samurai code. Nakadai plays a proud samurai fallen on hard times when his house is disbanded who displays almost superhuman effection when he is faced with defeat. A man filled with guilt, Tsugumo seeks to avenge the wrongful death of his son-in-law, Motome Chijiwa (Akira Ishihama). He marries his daughter off to this ronin, but they slip deeper and deeper into poverty, and eventually his son-in-law is forced to sell his swords and willing to attempt an act of desperation. Moteme Chijiwa asks to commit ritual suicide at the house of iyi, the estate of a powerful lord, in the hopes that he'll be given a small payoff to avoid the ritual suicide. Unfortunately the honor obsessed lord forces the desperate samurai to commit seppuku with his bamboo sword. Hanshiro Tsugumo comes to the estate asking to be allowed to commit seppuku and slowly relates his pathetic story. Here, Kobayashi ridicules the samurai system as absurd and inhuman. He falls back on false notions of ""honor"" and pride that sound good, but ultimately fall short when practiced in reality.Hanshiro requests that the clan's three best swordsmen act as his seconds for his act of seppuku, but they are nowhere to be found. He then reveals himself as the father-in-law of the tragic Motome and begins to exact his revenge. Arguably Kobayashi's masterpiece, this savage attack on the hypocrisy, cowardice, cruelty, and ultimate emptiness of the institution of the samurai warrior. It would certainly be enjoyed by fans of the samurai genre who prefer style, violence, a thoughtful story, and people who are interested in Japanese cinema."
"Dear Dr. McMahon, In the film Seppuku, a fluid portrayal of the morals upheld by Japanese society is only the surface of the black and white masterpiece. Through this medium the director is incredibly successful at insinuating and attacking many social issues that plagued the world in the 60's, when the film was made, and continue to act as a disease which is slowly gnawing away at the society which we all live in today. Its ironic that stories that are set centuries before the time in which they are presented, are more than often more relevant to present issues than many of the attempts made in what is considered the ""modern style"". No movie proves this point more true than Masaki Kobayashi's Seppuku, with camera work that is eerily reminiscent of still photography, each scene unique and harrowing in the feeling of tranquillity that penetrates the very skin of the viewer. This is the backbone to the film that provides both emotions and acts as a stage for the powerful events, that from the very beginning prove ominous and awaiting disaster. The happenings that ensue are laden with a quality that seems to be perfected by the director, the subtle art that is symbolism. It would be hard to find a movie that uses more techniques for exhibiting symbolism, this alone makes Seppuku a rare work. Seemingly around every corner lies another allusion or example of the corruption that surrounds the central scene of the movie, The House of Iyi. It would be an injustice to be cursory in examining the various symbols that are in the movie, rather each one deserves a complete and thorough dissection respectively. The hero of the story, Hanshiro, has exposed the corruption of the House of Iyi which stolidly made the statement that it is a honorable place. Through the movie we find out of the hard times which fall upon the daughter, son-in-law and grand-daughter of Hanshiro. We are made aware that the journey that Hanshiro makes to the house is not that of discovery and closure(by his request to commit Hara-Kiri), but rather of an objective of vengeance that is both silent and furious, portrayed perfectly by Tatsuya Nakadai. When Hanshiro is blamed by the head of Iyi that he has attempted to bring shame and dishonor to the house, the hero makes it clear that the place never had any to begin with. The House being the symbol of authority and the protagonist being the symbol of insurrection to an unjust system, the fate of the man is predictable, as is true in ""real life"". The order of the killing of Hanshiro is imminent, and is taken head on by the willing hero. During the time where Hanshiro explains of his motivations for the request of Hara-Kiri at this particular house, he sits attentively on a plain white mat. As the story proceeds and the order of death is made, Hanshiro remains on the mat, being attacked at all sides.  Pride and lunacy is a dangerous combination when fighting, and when attacked, this mixture proves to be fatal for the House of Iyi. Many lives are lost while trying to slay this one man and the first deaths occur on the mat where Hanshiro began the tale. The previously white mat is now stained with a black streak that seeps deep into the cloth. After many more casualties on the part of the House, Hanshiro finally finishes what he came to the house to do, commits ritual Hara-Kiri, leaving the House in chaos. A proud establishment will try with all of its might to remain in the image of what it thinks it is, covering up whatever is necessary to uphold the guise of its ideals. While the blood of this event marks numerous places where embarrassment occurred, it is for the most part cleaned up, leaving no sign of any sort of threat to normalcy. All that is, save the sheet where Hanshiro was sitting.  While cleaning up after the disaster, minions of Iyi take off the cloth that covers the board that Hanshiro was formerly kneeling on. The board is the justification that is held by the hero, attached firmly to the ground, and when the sheet is removed the viewer realizes that the beliefs that were held by Hanshiro were no mere front, but rather a true and enduring persistence for what he believed in. Of course nothing would be more fitting than a lasting example of the righteous rebel and the establishment which he fought against. While the stain on the sheet is taken to be washed, the camera remains fixed on the board, an identical mark of blood remains. No matter how much it may think it has stayed the same, the house has been effected by this occurrence. The possible references that can be made by this symbolism are both untold and unspecified. Analogies are applicable no matter what you are trying to compare, whether it be a ruling government, a specific person, or perhaps just a stab at authority and its corruption in general. Power enables ability to for the most part, erase, or cover up anything that could appear contrary to the ideas that are expressed by the one in power. The film Hara-Kiri though gives an uplifting reminder to all oppressed and a biting example to the oppressors; that even though a wrong can be covered up and washed, the stain will remain."
"(Don't read this if you haven't seen the movie)Dear Dr. McMahon,Masaki Kobayashi's Hara Kiri presents the viewer with several interesting criticisms of Japanese society which have relevance in western society as well. The movie is a commentary on the social elite and on the way the truth is presented as opposed to the actual truth.Even from the onset of the movie Kobayashi is poking at the social elite. He starts with the image of smoke blowing around a hollow statue of a member of the samurai class. He develops this idea throughout the movie and blatantly beats the viewer over the head with it with the way he portrays the head of the house of Iyi. With the abolishment of many feudal houses brings an excess of samurai. These ronin roam the country in poverty because their honour code does not allow them to work. Motome at one point in the movie tries to get a job but is unable to because of his status. The honour code is a set of superficial rules which have little to do with actual honour. It's more about how a person dresses and wears their hair than any achievement moral or physical. Surprisingly one of the only things these samurai can do for food or money is threaten to commit seppuku. The honour code does not allow honest work but it does allow threatening people in an attempt to extort money out of them. Motome sells the blades of his swords to try to save his dying wife and son. The self-righteous head of the house of Iyi lives in luxury while the truly righteous Hanshiro and Motome live in poverty on the verge of starvation.The head of the house of Iyi is made to be loathed in all of his self-righteousness. He looks down upon Motome who is trying as hard as he can to save his family, forces him to disembowel himself with a sword made of bamboo as he watches and jokes about it as if he was more noble because of Motome's shame. Then Hanshiro stalked and fought the three best swordsman of Iyi, showing the conflict between the honour code and true honour. In an effort to pick at the social elite he doesn't attack the people but the greater symbol of the elite, the topknot worn by all samurai. Then in his battle with Hikokuru Omagdaka the premier swordsman of the house of Iyi, the very best the social elite has to put forward, Hanshiro not only cuts the topknot off his head but he breaks his sword in two, destroying the most sacred symbol of the samurai. Hanshiro then goes after the house of Iyi itself, he picks up the stuffed samurai and throws him to the ground breaking it into many pieces.  Kobayashi never attacks any people in specific but the symbols which all the people live under.Then Kobayashi starts picking at the way truth is portrayed. Through the two separate tellings of the story about Motome two very different ideas of a person are shown. The first is of an honourless ronin who doesn't even have enough respect for the system to have real swords. The other is of a loving father and husband who realized what was more important false honour or family members. Then after hanshiro destroys the honour of the house of Iyi, the head of the house of Iyi writes that nothing happened that day in his journal. He forces several of his men to commit seppuku, says men killed by Hanshiro died of illness and stages a massive cover up and clean up operation to hide his disgrace. The head of the house of Iyi becomes this amazing tyrant who bends the will of his men, the life of several, and then rewrites history itself."
"Robbie Lynch""Hara-kiri"" is a great film that challenges the strict adherence to traditions and rituals. The story took many unpredictable twists and turns. This, combined with the great use of the camera, made for an unforgettable movie. The movie began with a former samurai named Hanshiro Tsugumo who asked permission to commit Hara-kiri (traditional samurai suicide) at the House of Iyi.  The members of the House let Hanshiro in and tried to scare him off by telling him of a former samurai who had tried to do the same feat.  That samurai was named Motome Chijiiwa.  He had come to the House threatening Hara-kiri, but he had really wanted money.  The elders, however, accepted his request as truth and granted him permission to commit Hara-kiri. Motome was obviously surprised at this response and asked for a day or two to take care of his affairs and then to return.  This request was refused and the Hara-kiri ritual commenced.  However, the ritual had not run smoothly. Motome's sword was not made of steel but of bamboo. Despite this disgrace, Motome was still forced to commit Hara-kiri.  Motome killed himself with great difficulty and while so doing further disgraced himself by having bitten off his tongue. Hanshiro Tsugumo was not moved by this story and still threatened to commit Hara-kiri.  The elders once again accepted the request and the ritual began. Before the ritual began, however, Hanshiro asked for the right to pick his second (the one who would cut off his head after Hanshiro disemboweled himself with his sword).  The request was granted.  However, the three men Hanshiro selected as his second were not well that day.  While messengers were sent to one of the three men, Hanshiro told his story. Hanshiro told of how eleven years earlier his friend was dying and asked Hanshiro to look after his son.  Hanshiro accepted the request and responded to his friend that he would protect the son with his life, while raising his own daughter as a single parent.  The son was actually Motome.  Hanshiro went on to explain how Motome and his daughter, Miho, become married.  The couple then bore a son named Kingo.  Since Motome was a former samurai, he could not find any work so he was forced to sell his sword blades (which are part of his soul) in order to support his family.  One day Kingo grew terribly ill and needed a doctor, but the family had no money.  So Motome went to the House of Iyi in hopes of stealing some money but he never returned.  Later Motome's body was returned to Miho.  Two days later Kingo died and within three days after that, Miho died.  Hanshiro went on to tell how he secured revenge by cutting of the top hair knots of the three best swordsmen in the House of Iye (acts which were worse than death), the same three men whom he had just requested to act as the second in the Hara-kiri ritual.  (Those three men later killed themselves.) Hanshiro then made the case that the rituals are ridiculous.  He only wished that he had sold his sword in order to pay for a doctor to help his grandson, Kingo.  The Lord of the House was not sympathetic to Hanshiro's story and the men in the House attacked Hanshiro.  Because he was such a great warrior, Hanshiro killed four men and wounded eight others.  While he was killing himself, he was shamefully shot.  The Lord of the House rewrote history and said that Motome, Hanshiro, and the four men that had been killed by Hanshiro had all committed Hara-kiri.  The Lord further reported that the three who had killed themselves because Hanshiro had cut their knot of hair had died of illness. ""Hara-kiri"" showed that rituals are sometimes unjust and, in order to live, they must at times be broken.  ""Hara-kiri"" was an amazing movie with simple graphics, little action, but with a powerful story line."
"While some so-called classics leave me cold, ""Harakiri"" (as it's known in the USA) really fires my imagination. This is a rare movie - the kind that I just can't stop recommending to people.Much of the film's appeal is based on surprising narrative twists, so I'm reluctant to delve too deeply into the plot here. But the basic setup is as follows - Japan has entered a time of peace, and consequently many samurai are unemployed and suffering in extreme poverty. Some samurai develop a ploy of threatening to commit suicide, but only so they can get sympathetic handouts of food and money from rich families. The film explores what happens when that ploy backfires in a very serious way.Director Masaki Kobayashi paces the film very slowly - by comparison, many Kurosawa and even Ozu films are breezy, and of course contemporary American films move approximately 800x faster. However, I am never really bored while watching ""Harakiri""; the film slowly builds toward a (very rewarding) climax, while filling in the characters' compelling backstories. In short, this movie requires - but pays back - patience. Stick with it, and you'll be rewarded with interesting revelations and even some exciting (and surprisingly violent) fight scenes.Due to its unusual blend of action, emotion and social commentary, ""Harakiri"" has shot right up my list of favorite films. I'm tempted to describe it as a Tarantino-style film, only with more of a conscience and a sophisticated worldview. But I suppose that any such comparisons between ""Harakiri"" and American movies must be broad and a little crude. Kobayashi's film stands on its own, of course, and is well worth seeking out for any cinema fan."
"Just saw this film thanks in part to comments left on this site, avoiding the spoilers of course. Just wanted to give my take on the film, and some of the reviews on the film.First if you haven't seen the film, simply put it's not just worth seeing, it's worth buying. It is a well performed, brilliantly photographed, hauntingly scored, and masterfully directed film.That said it's often spoken of in the same breath as SWORD OF DOOM, and that is highly misleading. If you go in expecting the visceral, brilliantly choreographed sword fights and unrelenting action of that film, you will not find it here.This is very much a drama, a morality tale of a time and a place; an exploration and an indictment of a way of life, and as such it has very few equals. The movie does lag, it is in many ways a monologue, one man talking more to himself than anyone else, of the ending of his life.But an enthralling story, captivating visuals, and above all else, one of the most intriguing and effective soundscapes since the great Dimitri Tiomkin's work on 1950s DOA, keeps this static film... moving and engrossing.Mentioning DOA, leads me to the bashing Hollywood takes regularly here from ""critics"" such as Landor28. Critics who in their rush to praise films, do it by backhanding other films. I'm not a critic, I'm just a reviewer. Critic implies you have some from the mountaintop perspective that gives you the right to criticize. Unless you've made movies, superior to what you're reviewing, you don't get to criticize. Review yes, criticize... no.Has Hollywood made bad films? Yes Hollywood makes its share of bad films, so does Japan, so does India, so does Hong Kong, so does every other country that makes movies. However Hollywood makes the most films, the most visible films, and the largest films, so it is an easy lump-sum target as opposed to taking each film on its own merits. Hollywood in fact is judged harsher by these critics, held to a higher standard than films from elsewhere in the world.I am no defender of Hollywood, as I don't work there, and not fortunate to know anyone who does, but I am a film fan, and a fan of the truth, and to praise films by Kurosawa and Kobayashi and to denigrate the films of Hollywood is to make a mistake these directors did not. These men, like all postwar filmmakers, were inspired by the films of Hollywood, particularly present in the work of all these directors is the large and brilliant work of John Ford.Kurosawa would be the first to state this. Fords widescreen westerns are at the heart of the cinematic recreation of the Samurai. The samurai world as envisioned by Kurosawa as much about history as it is the heroic imagery of the western. They are Stagecoach and Searchers transplanted to the east.A simplification to be sure, but not much of one. Postwar cinema in Japan and throughout the world copied from the states, and that's a good thing. And has started a trend that continues to this day of films successful in one country being copied in another. And we are the better for this two way copying. That's what film is people, copying.Copying a headline, or a book, or a play, or another film, copying a moment and making it your own. That's what all art is, looking at something, copying something, a sunset, a tree, a woman, a birds cry, and adding your own... bleeding to it. That's all life is, being influenced by something people have bled on, and if we are great men, leaving our own blood on it... to influence others.Only those with no art in their souls, don't see this. Only the very young, or the very stupid. Landor28 accuses Scorscese of stealing from Seppuku, an inane comment to make.How many shots in Seppuku but reecho earlier brilliant compositions of Stroheim. But I don't hear you calling Kobayashi a thief. And rightly so, no one owns a shot. Cinema, and images belongs to the story that can tell it. And if that image or look, can service well a thousand films, than it should be used a thousand times. What is film noir, but the same type of look, and camera angles used repeatedly. But used from the directors own viewpoint, it becomes the director's tale. So the comment of theft shows someone ignorant of the fact that there is nothing new under the sun, there are just 7 stories and 5 angles; and all cinema since.... but each person retelling this story through the lens of their own joy or pain.And if they are honest, the story each time... is worth hearing.Give these directors, whether they work in India, or New Zealand or Kenya or Hollywood their due. Shymalan is a great director, Weir is a great director, Fincher is a great director, Carl Frankin is a great director, Lee is a great director, Zimmerman is a great director, Gibson (for Braveheart not Passion), Ron Howard is a great director, Edward Zwick is a great Director (his resume since 89 reads like a bloody history lesson of great films.) and they all work in Hollywood, and their work inspires all kinds of foreign flicks you do rave about.Get off of Hollywood's back, it's always popular to hate the top dog, but it's also sometimes unwarranted.SEPPUKU is a great film, by a master director. ***1/2 out of ****. If you like it also check out these films: GLORY (1989 Ed Zwick), COURAGE UNDER FIRE, A HERO NEVER DIES, KING OF NEW YORK, LE SAMOURAI, SWORD OF DOOM, BACKDRAFT, Excalibur, TUAREG, MENACE II SOCIETY.They are all films about, to one degree or another, displaced honor and cannibal societies."
