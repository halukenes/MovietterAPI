"http://switchingreels.com/2014/01/28/sundance-review-whiplash/Ever had a dream of being a great football player? A great dancer? A great singer? A great musician? Our protagonist has a dream of being a great drummer, a drummer that will be remembered forever. Maybe you are still fighting for your dream. Maybe you have given up on greatness. Greatness doesn't come easily, you need to practice at it. Andrew practices until his hands bleed.Andrew (Miles Teller) is 19-year old student at a music conservatory in Manhattan. Terrence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) is a teacher at the conservatory with a ruthlessly brutal teaching style. After picking Andrew to play in the school band, he pushes Andrew to his limits in order to realize his full potential, at the risk of his humanity.I had a billiards teacher at one point in my life, who was close to becoming a pro in his craft but a grease fire accident changed all that. His perspective changed, to paraphrase, he realized he was becoming an asshole. He became a teacher of pool instead of becoming a pro player. Through him, I can understand what Terrence Fletcher was trying to instill into Andrew. My teacher would push me a little bit. When he gave me opportunities to show him up, ""run the table now,"" he would tell me, I failed. It's embarrassing when that happens but it's also a learning tool because more work needs to be done. You can't get by on talent alone but it certainly helps. On the other side of it, I saw a little bit of my teacher in Andrew. Losing who you are to perfect something you love. Good thing my teacher realized before it was too late.I lost myself in the story. It had something to say about not settling and asking more of yourself. Two fantastic performances from Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons. Perhaps it will push you to maybe pick up that guitar again, put on your ballet shoes, or hit the gym to bulk up. Whiplash is an incredibly powerful film. And after the final shot cuts to black, the film will stick with you for days.My expectations: Medium. I did not expect the film to be so powerful for me. Expectations exceeded.Recommendation: Cinema lovers and casual movie goers, I believe will enjoy this film.Re-watch value: I can watch this film again and I actually can't wait until it hits distribution.Memorable: I am still thinking about this film."
"In New York, a young jazz drummer (Miles Teller) is enrolled in a prestigious music school. His ambitions are tested and manipulated by a sadistic, perfectionist music instructor (J.K. Simmons).There are occasional moments in the film that seem far-fetched and over-the-top. But these are forgiven due to the edgy execution by director-writer Damien Chazelle and the acting.Teller is very believable as someone whose obsession to succeed overrides his sense of safety. This is partly explained in a useful scene at the beginning of an extended family gathering where one-upmanship seemed to be the traditional form of communicating.However, the movie belongs to Simmons who is the epitome of the authority-from-hell. He has rightly won many awards for this performance and he is likely to win more. He is so frightening when he is dominating the students that, even in the audience, there is a sigh of relief felt when he is acting more at-ease and human. His presence is that strong.""Whiplash"" ably presents the question of whether attaining genius is worth the price - at least in certain circumstances. It also succeeds as a psychological horror movie. The Simmons character is likely to be mentioned in the future as one of the movies' most memorable villains."
"Taking the festival circuit by storm since its Sundance premiere in January, Whiplash is starting to feel like the underdog that could go far with its crowd-pleasing intensity. On the surface, it's a gritty story about a brutal student-mentor relationship that oversteps boundaries. Underneath, it's a piercing examination of the psyche of unbridled ambition. Whiplash is a film that stops at nothing. As a result, it's the best film I've seen in years, and I say that without hesitation. This is a film that resonates on every single level and every moment counts. If writer/director Damien Chazelle was striving for greatness as much as his protagonist, then he has achieved it. Miles Teller, who's been steadily growing on me since The Spectacular Now, stars as Andrew Neyman, a 19-year-old aspiring jazz drummer who's pushed and inspired by the abuse and aspirations of his school band leader Fletcher, played by the ferocious J.K. Simmons like we've never seen him before. Chazelle has described the film as an origin story to the jazz musicians of the golden age, and it thrives on the myths of jazz heroes such as Charlie Parker. They're urgently looking for the next Parker, in search of perfection. But with that comes a great irony. The music genre is known as one for freedom of expression but here the jazz is soulless and mechanical, and that clouds the ethical judgment of the characters. Even so, Fletcher is a man who can tell if you have the right tempo within a bar. Although most of the audience for the film may not know much about music including myself, you get a feel for what he's looking for and when someone's wrong even if you don't know why. Simmons is as good as they say he is. He's a force of nature, with a terrifying presence that incites the fear Bryan Cranston achieved with the peak of his Walter White. But it's not a one-note performance. Simmons is still subversive with moments of weakness, insecurity, approachability, and he also sometimes brings in the lightness he's known for in other roles with Jason Reitman, exec producer here. Even though he's an unlikeable character with nothing nice to say, he's still somewhat endearing and enigmatic, much like R. Lee Ermey's drill sergeant in Full Metal Jacket. This demasculinisation through a barrage of insults is a theme explored in Whiplash and it argues whether it's a crime or an 'ends justifying the means' factor of life. It's not just a music film, but also one that adapts to the elements of sports training, war at boot camp and biopic genres with the way it frames its elements. Fletcher is representative of the devil on our shoulders that yells at us that we're not good enough and that symbolic idea resonates deeply for me. His poisonous words are more a part of Andrew's psyche than legitimate coaching techniques. What grabs me about the film is its discussion on artistic perfection, and especially in these intimate and rough sequences of practicing. What is objectively great in art? When is it good enough, and why? It toes a fascinating line. That's why drumming is such an interesting choice for the film to explore because it's so instinctive. Drummers have to make decisions within a fraction of a second and talent can only take you so far. The roaring beat in Whiplash puts your heart in your throat. Teller's performance as Andrew is terrific, one to match Simmons. Chazelle is committed on expressing the physicality of drumming and Teller captures it exhaustively without feeling contrived. It's the virtuosity of the writing that allows us into Andrew's head however. It's a long road to the top, but the script makes the right decision to allow him to revel in the little moments of success, but then to immediately test him in surprising and involving ways. Each turn of the story shapes his expectations and ambitions and then escalates it to the right point. While the film is a gripping experience nonetheless, in retrospect perhaps it is too bitingly cynical. It does suggest that you have to be deprived of a meaningful relationship to achieve your goals. It does appear to be very anti-positive reinforcement, but perhaps it's merely a statement on the abundant sheltering that the latest generation is enduring. Whiplash is refreshing to see, we all know we wouldn't be resilient enough to take that kind of punishment so it's cathartic to watch Andrew go through it all and see how far he'll go. His frustration, regrets, fear and rage with himself cuts to the core of the human condition as he's pushed further and further. The technical aspects of the film help it become so stimulating with dizzying closeups tightly edited together and its the stark orange tinted cinematography. It's thoroughly impressive that the film was shot in only 19 days for them to get shots so immaculately timed and performed with all those complicated movements. There's a refreshing brevity to the film with its sharp atmosphere, but it's so rich in emotion, psychological tension and personal subtext. It neither rushes nor drags, on paper nor on screen. It really is a film that lingers in your mind for days, nagging you, like Fletcher over your shoulder. Maybe it'll continue to linger for weeks. I hope so too, especially for Oscar voters. It seems that J.K. Simmons is building momentum to be a lock for Best Supporting Actor at this point. However, Whiplash isn't just a best of year film, nor best of decade. It approaches best of all-time worthy with its identifiable themes of meticulous work ethics, fulfilling aspirations, resilience of the soul, and knowing when to no longer measure yourself to your mentor. I'll take this film with me for a while as a screaming motivator.10/10. Best film of the decade.Read more @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com/)"
"An unknown title, by an unknown director, starring an unknown lead, what does that form? Only one of the best damn dramas of this century to date. Inspiring, intense, reverent, Damien Chazelle's jazz-infused drama is an incredibly complex character study that has newcomer Miles Teller and veteran J.K. Simmons at the top of their game in this brilliant effort, 'Whiplash' is arguably the most riveting and sensational drama from 2014.J.K. Simmons stars as antihero Terence Fletcher, a character we look at as the opportunity of Andrew's success, but also we hate for his brutal portrayal. From his profanity-clad embodiment of evil to the ever-hopeful light at the end of the film, we go through stages of loving, hating and even fearing him, a character who despite his occasional moments of sympathy, cares solely about the outcome of his orchestra, and shuns away anyone who tries to destroy that. Simmons's performance is flawless and breathless, a truly resonant achievement, and one of the most Oscar-deserving performances of recent years.The gold and black colour palette, fast-paced editing, fluent and claustrophobic cinematography - every single component adds a fresh face to 21st century cinema and independent films as a whole, further supporting my conclusion that indie films have overtaken blockbusters for the provision of unique visions and entertainment. Chazelle's effort pays off as he creates not only one of the greatest villains of the 21st century in the form of Fletcher, but also one of the greatest movies of the 21st century, if not of all time, through which he rekindled the dying flame that is jazz.The fusion of emotions throughout make this a film that thrusts the audience into a world of obsession, dedication and confrontation, thus ensuing a tale of inspiration, a man and his dreams of becoming a ""somebody"", and to conclude, let's just note that final drum solo and sense of rebellion Andrew feels, it is utter gold, truly perfect. This movie is powerful, it is intense, it is unique, it is a stunning masterpiece!"
"After seeing Damien Chazelle's Whiplash - a film the young up-and- coming director wished to do for some time now - being so beautifully realized and brought to life by everyone involved in the project, I was glad and relieved, mainly because I have seen the short film, which was pretty incredible.I believe that among the most telling facts about a film's fortunes and qualities, is the ability to broaden it's public, but in the same time not forgetting that cinema is not all about commercial success and mass audiences.Or with other words - a film that is not just eye candy and booms and explosions, but also craft, soul, dedication and wits.Those are some of the things not only the film itself possesses, but the people behind it have in abundance as well.The upcoming Miles Teller plays the young and dedicated student Andrew Nieman, who has the drive, the ambition to succeed and to be great, which is fine, as long as it doesn't derail your personal life.A lesson the young drummer learns the hard way.Blind ambition is the thing, that can describe our anti-hero of sorts, Terrence Fletcher a.k.a the brilliant J.K. Simmons, who has a thing for mindeffin' his students to the point of total physical and mental exhaustion and even depression.But he does it for a reason, for the sole purpose of finding the next big, even great, thing in jazz and in music as a whole.The next prodigy, the next ""Yardbird"" Charlie Parker that will be otherwise lost, if not being pushed to the very limit.And boy, does J.K. Simmons nails it.Chazelle has done a masterful job in casting the two leads in Teller and Simmons.Their respective acts are full of purpose, full of tension and ultimately terrific.Expect some awards going in the way of ""Whiplash"" and look out for Simmons in the Oscars shortlist, that's how good he is in it.And in his own words: ""What a shame we wrapped it up in only 19 days"".It must have been really fun playing a part like Terrence Fletcher and Simmons completely sold it.As I said, the best movies are those, that reach out to the most diverse and wide spectrum of audiences, not those, who can connect to a massive number of people, who are representatives of only one specific audience type.And Chazelle has achieved just that with ""Whiplash"" - a precise, tension-building film, full of beautifully staged pieces and above all else, a love towards music and the challenges it often represents if you want to get to the very top.The film ended in a big round of applause from the packed theater and I am sure that will be the case a long time from now!My grade: 9/10"
"There is so many excellent great things to say about this film. To start off I will say it may be slow and to different for some to enjoy and so that I warn you. Now I will say that I can not express the idea enough of how surprising this film is. Jk Simmons does an outstanding performance as the highly unpredictable hair trigger tempered teacher Fletcher, Miles Teller an actor who I've only seen in mediocre comedies also shines in a breakthrough performance as the ambitious drummer Andrew. The performance are outstanding and that's just the tip of the iceberg.My favorite thing about this film is how it has created it's own one of a kind spot in the music genre of film, it's atmosphere is unlike any other as well. The idea that this film is one of a kind can't be stressed enough, I guarantee you cannot find another film out there like this. This film expresses a shockingly high intensity for a music film. I believe that Jk Simmons acting is what fueled a lot of the intensity. When you watch this film even though it's pace will seem slow to most it's intensity is impossible to miss. I can see how a lot of certain people may find this film hard to enjoy but for me this film as slow as it is couldn't have been more intense. The mere fact that a music film shows some strong intensity like this one did is mind blowing to me. I don't know how many of you had this same experience or something similar then you already know what I'm talking about. I have a good feeling and I'm hopeful this film rakes in some acting Oscars because this film deserves at least one. I haven't read anything on this films page and I'm sure others have expressed similar opinions and all I can say is listen and trust me. I'm praying you enjoy this film and experience it's one of a kind intensity just as I did. Thanks for reading my review and enjoy."
"This movie was far better than the trailer made it look.JK Simmons gave a stellar performance as a music teacher in the best Jazz school, trying desperately to find and develop the next jazz legend. From the moment he appears he demands the screen, literately. There's a part in the flick were he just burst open the door putting a halt on whatever is going, and makes it all about what he wants, which sets the tone for the entire movie. One of the best antagonist I've seen at the movies.Miles Teller plays the protagonist, A first year Jazz student who wants to be the next Jazz legend and is willing to go through the pain needed to become just that. I've been a fan of Miles Teller for a while and this movie just increase my fandomIt does not matter whether you are into jazz or not, this flick is about and boy willing to kill himself to become the best and the man willing to kill the boy so he can be the best. For anyone who has ever been in that kind of pressure, weather it be at college or on the playing field(I kid you not, watching these guys play Jazz played out like I was watching a Football movie with Miles being the Quarterback and JK being the coach) It was an emotion trill ride with a lot of ups and downs, and just when you think the ride is over, we go for a second time around. Excellence!!"
"I don't say that often, in fact...never. There aren't enough superlatives to describe the amazingness of Whiplash. Damien Chazelle crafted not just a tense dramatic piece of cinema, but a thematic experience with layered subtext. Andrew is a college student who simply wants to be the best drummer. Terence Fletcher, a renowned teacher at said college, sees potential in Andrew and chooses him to be the drummer in his band, at the expense of emotional distress. This is a brutal character study, absolutely savage. This is about Fletcher as much as it is about Andrew. The psychological battle and the consequential emotional turmoil that follows. I've never been so compelled in a drama ever (and this is my 5th viewing). The strive for perfection amidst the continuous passion that elevates Andrew as a person and how Fletcher uses his passion in attempt to obtain the perfect musician that Andrew hopes to be. The struggle for perfection is difficult in any profession, there is no right or wrong way to achieve this; the question is: ""is there a line between gently pushing someone towards a goal or inflicting emotional torture upon them?"". Fletcher leans towards the latter, so much so that he actually imposes physical damage to Andrew to test whether he will be discouraged from the harsh reality of perfection or not. The internal struggle in Andrew is excellently conveyed, you can see his passion seeping through the blood, sweat and tears and yet mentally unable to cope with Fletcher's methods. A simple story, but executed with such ferocity and intelligence that it just feels fresh. Damien Chazelle directed the heck out of this. Quick cuts between the musical instruments and nice long takes of Miles Teller and J.K Simmons duelling in anger. Speaking on Simmons, the best performance I've seen in years. Both complicated and terrifying simultaneously, he deserved every award. Teller was near perfect as well, conveying innocence and vulnerability. Look, I can talk about Whiplash forever. It's a masterpiece. End of review."
"Greetings again from the darkness. The pursuit of greatness is not always pretty. No matter if your dream is athletics, dancing, music or some other; you can be sure hard work and sacrifice will be part of your routine. You will likely have a mentor, teacher or coach whose job is to cultivate your skills while pushing you to new limits. This film questions whether the best approach is intimidation or society's current preferred method of nurturing.Miles Teller plays Andrew, a first year student at an elite Manhattan music conservatory. Andrew dreams of being a great jazz drummer in the vein of Buddy Rich. When offered a rare shot at the top ensemble, Andrew quickly discovers the conductor is a breed unlike anything he has ever encountered. The best movie comparison I can offer for JK Simmons' portrayal of Terence Fletcher is R Lee Ermey's Drill Instructor in Full Metal Jacket. This is no Mr Holland's Opus. Fletcher bullies, intimidates, humiliates and uses every imaginable form of verbal abuse to push his musicians, and especially young Andrew, to reach for greater heights.Andrew and Fletcher go head to head through the entire movie, with Fletcher's mental torment turning this into a psychological thriller ... albeit with tremendous music. We witness Andrew shut out all pieces of a personal life, and even take on some of Fletcher's less desirable traits. Andrew's diner break-up with his girlfriend (Melissa Benoist) is much shorter, but just as cold as the infamous opening scene in The Social Network. At a small dinner party, Andrew loses some of the sweetness he inherited from his dad (Paul Reiser), and unloads some Fletcherisms on some unsuspecting family friends.Writer/Director Damien Chazelle has turned his Sundance award-winning short film into a fascinatingly brutal message movie that begs for discussion and debate. The open-ended approach is brilliant, though I found myself initially upset at the missing clean wrap that Hollywood so often provides. What price greatness? Is comeuppance a reward? Are mentors cruel to be kind? For the past few years, I have been proclaiming that Miles Teller (The Spectacular Now) is the next John Cusack. Perhaps that bar is too low. Teller just gets better with each film. His relentless energy draws us in, and we find ourselves in his corner ... even though this time, he's not the greatest guy himself. Still, as strong as Teller is, the film is owned by JK Simmons. Most think of him as the dad in Juno, or the ever-present insurance spokesman on TV, but he previously flashed his bad side as the white supremacist in ""Oz"". Even that, doesn't prepare us for Simmons' powerhouse performance ... just enough humanity to heighten his psychological torturing of musicians.You should see this one for Simmons' performance. Or see it for the up and coming Teller. Enjoy the terrific music, especially Duke Ellington's ""Caravan"". See it for the talking points about teachers, society and personal greatness. See it for any or all these reasons - just don't tell director Damien Chazelle ""good job""."
"Whiplash is low budget film making at its finest, and surely promises big things from rookie director/writer Damien Chazelle. Seeing this film in theaters was the first time this year that I have completely enraptured (granted, I have not seen all of the top films that have come out so far). Also, I am a succor for quality films about musicians, and Whiplash ranks in my all time favorites in that genre. The tension did not let up from the very first scene, especially as soon as the incredible J.K. Simmons enters. Simmons, along with Miles Teller (who's Project X days are now long behind him) have some of the best on screen chemistry I've seen. They're connected; one cannot act without it affecting the other. The film is almost entirely focused on this relationship, and the simplicity definitely services the film. I hope people will go and see it and vote with their pocketbooks for excellent low budget films."
"I saw this about 24 hours ago at the Best of Fest for Sundance, and this last 24 hours I have done little but think about and marvel at this film. I really had zero expectations going in, I heard the buzz surrounding it in town, but knew very little about it as the film began. I have yet to get the words that do my thoughts justice for this movie but I am going to try. First everything about this film was stellar; casting, writing, acting, directing, music and cinematography all came together to just tell an incredible story. I want to say a bit more about a couple of these aspects. Acting, first of all I don't know who impressed me more Miles Teller in the lead as Andrew Nieman or JK Simmons playing Band teacher Terence Fletcher. Both did so great that had either been a lesser actor they would have been out shined by the other. Simmons' performance really reminded me of Gunnery Sargent Hartman from Full Metal Jacket, except rather than emotionally destroying and rebuilding marines he was doing it to 18 year old kids. His character could have easily been cartoony and 2 dimensional but Simmons gave him such depth that the whole film I felt compassion for and even understood his motives, even before he lays them out for Nieman in the third act. Two scenes bring you to the core of this character and the line that has intrigued me for 24 hours is ""No words in the English language are more dangerous than 'good job.'"" (thus why I titled my review as such, sorry I couldn't resist). Then on to Teller's performance, for a younger actor who I haven't seen in much I must say he played his role like a seasoned actor. His performance just wrapped me up and to find out he did much of the drumming himself is insane. Whilst watching some of the intense scenes I felt like I was watching him be executed, and other times it feels like the fight in Rocky, you feel like you are just watching him get demolished, except all of this is emotional rather than the easier physical. Whether it is the discouragement, the socially awkwardness, the single parent household, the internal conflict, the hubris, the arrogance, and at times the mental torture that he put himself through, all just blew me away. Teller reminded me of a much much more talented John Cusack and had the charisma and electricity to connect to the audience. The one other thing I must commend is the writing, so often you kind of know where a movie is headed but this movie stayed very unpredictable and just when you think for certain how a scene or sequence of scenes will play out they take a hard left and keeps you off balance (in a good way). It was so refreshing, a few times I thought the bow was on the film but then something disrupts how ""it should go or end"". Sorry if I rambled, perhaps after thinking on it more I can get a more focused review, needless to say this film is a must-see when it gets a broad release. Great job to all involved and congrats on winning the award at Sundance, you certainly earned it. One last thing if this gets attention in wide release this could see a heightened interest in Jazz, this is certainly a film that can make even the not-so musically inclined want to throw on a Jazz record and just drown in it."
"This movie should please a wide audience of non-musicians. I am not a musician but I've seen movies based on things I know very well and it's always exaggerated and unrealistic and it usually bugs me more than other people; I can easily imagine how real musicians may dislike this one.
The directing and acting are great (although J.K. Simmons steals the whole show) as are cinematography and sound. However the whole premise is wildly unrealistic, and the moral of the story ""to be great you need to be pushed beyond your limits"" is a tired trope that has often been done in a better way than here.
On a personal note, I hate bullies with a passion and there can never be a ""but it's for a good reason"" excuse for bullying."
"""Music is your own experience, your own thoughts, your wisdom. If you don't live it, it won't come out of your horn. They teach you there's a boundary line to music. But, man, there's no boundary line to art."" Charlie Parker sums it all, Cinema is true Art. I wasn't expecting to feel this way after watching this movie. Every moment has tension and something unexpected occurring. It is as if the director had chosen to apply the tempo of the drums to the script. Anyone can relate to this story. We all have pursued a dream, a passion ... Rather or not we made it our everyday job or maybe just a hobby aside, some of us strive for something bigger. This film is a journey in the search of your inner spirit, inner creativity ... not only will it make it clear that you cannot succeed without effort and hard work, it will also make you realize there are two different kinds of artists : - those who make art, - and those who make beautiful art""Beautiful"" because they are stimulated by a special strength within, a GIFT. Is it because I reminisce N.Y.C. or that I play the drums? I simply believe the performances were astonishing and the actors perfectly chosen to embody these terrific characters. I won't say ""good job"" but rather ""thank you"", to the promising Franco-American director Damien Chazelle﻿ for sharing his vision."
"When it comes to cinema, there are often little gems in a sea of bigger spectacles, that can break through in the most proficient way. Last year, I pleaded to the entire film universe that discover and understand ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" from the Coen Brothers after seeing it for the first time at NYFF. This year, I've seem to already come to terms that the next film that will utilize all my energy and resources this year will be Damien Chazelle's highly intense psychological drama ""Whiplash."" An impeccable and tightly wound experience that brings your anxiety to a feverish level. As small, and utterly different as I'm about to compare, I haven't felt this uneasy with a film's tension since Paul Greengrass' ""Captain Phillips,"" coincidentally also was a NYFF title. Two other similar traits that embody the two are the intense and completely submersible performances that inhabit them. Stars Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons are absolutely astonishing, featuring two of the year's very best turns.Chazelle's film tells the story of Andrew (Teller), a first year music student that seeks out and joins the prestigious school band, headed by an intense and frightening teacher Mr. Fletcher (Simmons).Walking out of the screening I fully knew (though I fully hope to be proved wrong this year) that Miles Teller would be my ""Oscar Isaac"" this year. A performance that should shoot to the top of any awards consideration for a lead actor, but unfortunately will be passed over show after show. Teller is submerged in a way that we haven't seen the young actor achieve at this stage in his career. After plowing onto the scene opposite Nicole Kidman in ""Rabbit Hole,"" and then helming ""The Spectacular Now"" with complete ease and intensity, I was not expecting him to be the machine of fury and magnitude that is on display in ""Whiplash."" There are moments where he channels the emotional aura of performances like Tom Hulce/F. Murray Abraham in ""Amadeus,"" as crazy as that sounds. I am so excited to see where Teller goes from here. It makes the future of film a lot more bright, knowing that someone like him will be rising up in the ranks.Everything you've heard about J.K. Simmons is true and then some. A fully fleshed out supporting role, Chazelle doesn't write Fletcher as a caricature. He's a deeply acute individual, full of passion and acrimony. Chazelle doesn't keep Simmons at a ""10,"" he and Simmons allow him to find a range of empathy, hatred, and cryptic allowances that will keep you at the edge of your seat. As I watched Simmons flesh out a performance that can only be described as magnificent, I kept coming back in my mind to Christoph Waltz in the Oscar-winning ""Inglourious Basterds,"" a role that found much heat on the awards circuit. The world/all film lovers will not be able ignore the stunning presence of Simmons. A Supporting Actor nominations (maybe even a win) seems all but assured (and deserved). Looking back at the veteran actor's career that included memorable roles in ""Juno,"" ""Burn After Reading,"" and ""Up in the Air,"" a role like this could not have come at a better time. Already impressive in his brief work in Jason Reitman's ""Men, Women & Children,"" writers, directors, casting agents, and producers will be pounding on the actor's door.You can't credit ""Whiplash"" without citing the words and control by writer/director Damien Chazelle. An amazing and outstanding sophomore effort (unfortunately have not seen his debut ""Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench"") that channels a young Bennett Miller. Vigorous, self-assured, and innovative, Chazelle is a brilliant auteur filmmaker that knows exactly what type of films he wants to make. He takes inspiration from his own life, his love of film and music, and other places I'm sure we don't know about, and molds them into a gritty, layered experience, conditioned with rich characters, all realized through the writer's story. It's one of the best scripts of the year.""Whiplash"" features some of the best minutes of film seen in 2014. An ending that will bring tears to your eyes, dual performances that will have you applaud, and an experience that you surely will not forget. Drumming has never felt like such a personality. It acts as a visible tool for the viewer to understand and try. If you love music, appreciate education, and dare to be better than your current state, you will find something very real to latch onto. Hold on, and hold on tight.""Whiplash"" is being distributed by Sony Pictures Classics and will be released October 10 in limited release (and then expanding after). A must-see for all movie lovers!"
"The good parts:The movie is very sensitively filmed. The camera relentlessly explores every bump on Teller's and Simmons's heads like a documentary about Greek sculpture. It adds a lot to the feel of the movie in a wonderfully subtle way.Simmons and Teller (as the ""Studio"" band director and the, I guess, protagonist young drummer) do a great job. Simmons in particular is really the nexus of energy for the entire movie, and owns that role with absolute precision.The music, when it's actually music, is well-chosen and well-performed.The terrible parts:Simmons (""Fletcher"") and Teller (""Andrew"") are essentially the only characters in the film. Andrew's dad and his not-really girlfriend are secondary characters that serve to remind the audience what actual humans are like. Andrew is an insufferable jerk, and Teller does an amazing job of maintaining (mostly) a stone-faced, blankly insensitive look throughout almost every tense moment of the film. Simmons's Fletcher is a superb sadistic maniac. He's not ""intense"" or ""volatile"" - he's a psychotic monster.I'm debilitated as a reviewer because my son is a talented young drummer, so I get to see good drumming all the time. The persistent trope in the film of Andrew drumming until his hands bleed is wildly unrealistic; that basically cannot happen if you're a drummer good enough to get into a prestigious music school in the first place. Everything else about Andrew at the fancy school, upon further examination, is completely unreal. He basically never talks to the other complete non-entities in the band. They're all like POWs, obeying the maniac director unflinchingly (except when they fail, when they're abused and ejected). My son (whose judgment I trust because he's also obsessed, but not a jerk) described the silly drum ""competition"" as ""three people who can't drum doing shitty grind-core break beats"". (To be fair, he liked the movie. What can you do.)So OK, the movie is an allegory, and not intended to be realistic. So it's an allegory about how a sadist can really help a self-absorbed jerk with some obsession get better at what they want to do? I can't find any way to sympathize with that. I mean, who is that speaking to?Finally, the actually appropriate and yet irritatingly obtrusive product placement (pristine cymbal labels, super-clean Zildjian logo on Andrew's stick bag, etc) got pretty hard to take by the (truly weird) ending.Go see this movie because everybody else thinks it's great, but if you feel funny afterwards maybe this review will offer some comfort that you're not alone."
"In the 70s, a new genre of films aimed at black audiences emerged entitled, 'Blaxploitation'. The genre primarily glorified stereotypical ""criminal"" behavior in black neighborhoods. Now with Damien Chazelle's, 'Whiplash', he's invented a new genre primarily for a large coterie of Caucasian males: 'Jazzploitation', set in an elite jazz program at a Julliard-like school of higher musical instruction. Both white liberal film critics and martial arts enthusiasts alike, will enjoy this exercise in sado-masochistic shenanigans as evidenced by the plethora of rave reviews now gracing a multitude of web pages over the internet.Don't ask any of our critics who rave about the film to require Mr. Chazelle to provide even a modicum of verisimilitude. I'm talking, of course, about how Mr. Chazelle's antagonist, the martinet music instructor, Terence Fletcher, would even last five minutes at a prestigious music conservatory, given his vast repertoire of sociopathic behavior. Oh but wait—'Whiplash' really is supposed to be more like a fable, so Mr. Chazelle is given a pass—he no longer has to be beholden to 'conventional' narratives.But even fables should operate within a somewhat realistic world. And is it realistic to have Fletcher's co-worker shrink from him (are they all so afraid that they dare not assert themselves one bit?) Is it realistic not to see Fletcher's interactions with his supervisors (are they also completely browbeaten by him?) Would the administration allow such a person to continually humiliate his students, hurl ethnic and gay slurs, and actually throw things at the students, which could result in personal injury (possibly subjecting the school to a lawsuit?). Fletcher is clearly a caricature, who belongs in an army setting and not a music conservatory. Nonetheless, Chazelle needs the character to not only titillate us along the way but to illustrate his simplistic morality play, which entails a warning about the dangers of obsessive careerism.Now of course various naysayers will argue that there ARE people like Fletcher who seek to bring out the best in their students by utilizing 'tough love' but such pedagogues in real life must work within the 'system' and the 'pushing' is much more subtle than what is depicted here.The same goes for Chazelle's protagonist, Andrew Neyman, who plays the obsessed drummer student who seeks to get in the good graces of the ruthless Fletcher. Neyman is played by Miles Teller whom I liked very much in 'The Spectacular Now'. Since he plays drums in real life, Teller is pretty convincing playing the drums in the film. But Chazelle applies the same 'sledge hammer' approach toward the character 'Neyman' as he does with 'Fletcher'. Neyman wants to 'make it' at 'any cost'. He plays the drums so hard until his hands start bleeding (various drummers posting on the internet deny they've seen cases of this); and then on his way to a competition, Neyman gets in a bad car accident, but STILL drags himself to the performance and attempts to play (Chazelle seeks to prove the inane point that Neyman is so obsessed, that he'll do anything to win—even if it means playing seriously injured and jeopardizing his own life). No really, can you see anyone doing this? But again, since this is more like a melodramatic fable, Chazelle can have his characters do the most ridiculous things, and seemingly get away with it!Two thirds of the Whiplash plot concerns Fletcher's quest to supposedly bring out the best in his students (none of whom do we really get to know except Neyman). John Bleasdale writing in CineVue finds Fletcher's diatribes appealing: ""His razor wit, sheer outrageousness, inventive taunting and vulgar insults are at once appalling and blackly funny."" I agree that Fletcher's insults are appalling but ""blackly funny""? Keep in mind that all the other characters who come in contact with Fletcher, have no ego, to the point that no one will oppose him. Therefore, Fletcher can get away with saying anything he feels like (some may call this 'wit', but in reality they're simply one note monologues--a set of variations on a theme).The second act crisis manifests itself when Neyman is kicked out of school after physically attacking Fletcher. The way back toward some kind of 'equilibrium' is when Neyman agrees to give a deposition in a lawsuit that eventually leads to Fletcher's dismissal from the conservatory.The Whiplash climax occurs after Neyman and Fletcher meet at a jazz club where Fletcher is now playing and Neyman agrees to play at a showcase. This turns out to be an ambush, since Fletcher arranges for Neyman to get up there without sheet music and he can only end up improvising (Fletcher is so demented that he's seemingly willing to sabotage the entire performance to get back at Neyman who he knows testified against him). Neyman runs off backstage into the arms of his good guy father but suddenly summons the courage to come back and play, where he dazzles, performing an extraordinary drum solo. Has Neyman triumphed after enduring the humiliating set-up? Not at all! He merely plays into Fletcher's stratagem to push him beyond his limits emotionally—even if it means that he must sacrifice his dignity and self-worth by allowing the mad sociopath to manipulate him over and over again.In order to accept Chazelle's tawdry tale, one must accept the conventions of melodrama. Clearly it's written as heightened reality to make a point about the sadomasochistic relationship between student and teacher. While Chazelle may ultimately view his characters at a distance with the correct moral upper hand, he mirrors Tarantino, by reveling in the violence that he is also attempting to disdain. The 'Whiplash' machinations end up more tawdry and sensationalistic than compellingly tragic.I would recommend 'Whiplash' for the excellent cinematography and of course all the neat jazz music. I'll pass on the story—due to its clear, unrealistic and melodramatic aftertaste."
"My non-musician friends love this film and insisted I see it. I've been a jazz musician for over 30 years and have taught in a jazz university for over 20. So they figured I would relate. Sorry, this is total crap and it makes me sad to think that the average guy out there thinks Kenny G is cool and this film is a hard-edged depiction of the high-pressure jazz school scene. First of all, no prof would be there a day after any of the rehearsals Terence ran, he'd be dismissed immediately (not hard to do, apparently this school didn't have tenure). And next, jazz is communication, conversation, thoughtfulness, and a big dollop of joyful soul. Any drummer with the competitive mean-spirited attitude shown by any of these students would find themselves in extremely lonely company, nobody appreciates that. This is the 21st Century equivalent of Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland saying, ""I know, let's build a show to save the town!"" as a representation of Show Biz. it's Hollywood hokum, folks, and I resented its basic assumptions. Where is the Soul? That said, J.K. Simmons is great, working with what he's got. And the cinematography and editing are well done (what IS all that water on the cymbals we see so often? Sweat? If Elvin Jones had gained two hundred pounds he wouldn't have sweated like that! Oh well.) which is why I grudgingly added two stars to this. It's been a while since I so disliked a film. P.S. my drummer plays better than any of these guys. Hah!"
"This movie tries so hard to display the hardships of training to be a musician that the whole image shifts into simple physical and mental abuse of human beings, in this case teenagers. As another reviewer said: it is the boot camp of music. I did not believe what I was seeing. If there was a movie where some dog-whisperer is hitting the dog and yelling at it and this would prove to be working as a method to 'educate' the dog, then people would be upset. But treating a human like that is OK? this just sickens me. yes, you can get humans to do some things by pushing them with violence. Get them into an obedient state of mind, that is simply following orders. But there is a reason why this strategy of motivation has proved to be only effective in the military: There, human lives are indeed worthless. This treatment will make you 'harder', meaning it will make you less of a human being.When it comes to music however it is impossible to achieve great results with these methods. It can only lead to a soul- and heartless disaster. A fitting result would have been an aggression build-up in the main character which would have prevented him from ever playing anything worth listening to again. This reaction has been seen in other movies where usually the people that are socially connected to the main character will have to suffer from the violent state of mind that this mistreatment is causing. The other possibility is a simple resignation, either by quitting music or by quitting life.But what is displayed here is wrong on many levels, because it tells you that this abuse leads to something beautiful. That it is all worth it because it pushes you to your limits and then you will be a great musician. Whoever made up this story is either suffering from a severe psychosis or has the intent to justify abusive methods in education by presenting them as effective.If you treat people with violence they will get violent too. Either towards others or towards themselves. This is the only result you will achieve. And in this case it would also completely destroy the main character's ability to be a musician. Music is not the military. You do need discipline and training, but this comes from mental strength. And you do not get stronger by being abused. It will only weaken you.It makes me sad seeing that apparently this movie is entertaining to people. This can only be the case if they do not see the utter failure in judgment that is presented here. And if they do not see it then they are blind in a way that is worrying."
"I find it very sad that so many people - including so-called professional reviewers - have rated this crap so highly. I did not walk out (although I was greatly tempted to do so) but saw it to the end. A total waste of time.Here's what might spoil it for you, should you believe the BS that's being spread around this stinking pile of excrement: It could have actually been OK if it hadn't been so laughably impossibly ridiculous. Perhaps if it had been set in the fifties or the forties when people had much less developed consciousness of human rights? But even so... I suppose the moral/lesson we are supposed to learn is... if you can't warp your students enough by abuse to force them to become great musicians then it is perfectly alright to discard or destroy them in the attempt. This glorified tyrant and bully can himself only produce music at a grade one level and so because he cannot 'do' he 'teaches?'He does not teach, he does not inspire; he withholds approval, negatively reinforces and rules by fear, and is feared rather than respected. I would have a difficult time to point to a single (pedagogical) scene in the film that had any merit whatsoever or was worth watching for any reason. Maybe I should say that its evident popularity may be evidence that we are truly living in the end times... ha! See the film if you want to be current, but please decide for yourself from watching it and don't believe the hype about its 'genius' or 'brilliance.' It is not either of those things; it's a poorly written, sad joke."
"I gave it 28 minutes. That was generous, in that I knew it was going to be terrible within about 2.I've been to music school. It's not like this. The teachers aren't like this. No one's like this (obviously I'm referring to 'Hollywood idea of what a hard-ass music teacher might be like in some weird juvenile negative fantasy' Fletcher).I switched off when he threw a chair at Andrew the drum prodigy and then slapped him. SLAPPED him. Repeatedly. In front of a whole, cowed class of what, in legal terms, would be called witnesses to an assault, for playing slightly fast, the first time he's ever played to him in a band practice.I'm sorry, what?! Where does this/would this/has this ever happened? In a Charles Dickens novel about a jazz drum student, possibly. In anything even vaguely purporting to be based on real life now, um...No.I'm stunned. Yet another IMDb/Metacritic/Rotten Tomatoes gush-fest that is so laughably bad, you have to check the page again to really believe it's got such high praise.Excruciating nonsense."
"If you are a believer in the clichéd notion that success can only come from obsessive dedication to the exclusion of all normal human interaction, coupled with mountains of degradation, suffering, humiliation, and physical torture, you will absolutely adore this worthless pile of clichés, stereotypes, and bankrupt cinematic ideas. The story of a young jazz drummer who is brutalized by a sadistic teacher in the interests of spurring him to greatness is one of the most repulsive exercises in sheer idiocy ever committed to the screen. I watched and watched, waiting for some valid point to emerge from scenes of torment, bleeding hands, broken relationships, hideous nastiness and all the rest, but in the end, all we get is a whopping nonsensical cliché that only a fool could buy into. J.K. Simmons (the psychologist from Law and Order) does a credible job as the sadistic teacher, but honestly, no one could do much with a part this stereotypical... he couldn't have been more villainous unless he had a mustache to twirl. And the rest of the cast doesn't do any better with their phony baloney parts. Folks, if you don't have a credible story based in some form of recognizable and believable reality, nothing else matters. The fact that this one gets such a high rating on IMDb proves that HL Mencken was right: No one ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public."
"First of all, English is not my mother tongue. Excuse me for the mistake I made in this review.Every one seems to like this movie. It is weird that many people seems to avoid to talk about the message or don't think this movie have any massage at all. But for me the message is loud and clear: You must Insult, humiliate， mentally abuse and physically violate your student to make them good. That's the only way to encourage them to achieve greatness. As a student you must take any advantage you can, no matter what it is going to cause. Remove everything except the thing you want to master from your life FOREVER, otherwise you are not going to be successful. There are lots of things in the movie that state these message clearly. The most obvious one is the ending. Both Andrew and Fletcher achieve their goal. They achieve it beautifully. Andrew did a improvisation at the end and create his own music. Fletcher get his Charlie Parker. Detail like the poster in the school, says something about end up in a rock band. The fame of Fletcher's band in the movie. Every single effect that Fletcher occur to Andrew like in a scene, Andrew describe other drummer's performance as this s**t. Some information that state the disadvantage of Fletcher's way of teaching are blurred out. such as the Death of a student that I forget his name. Student that Fletcher send out the classroom are never seen again. Fletcher's impact to other student. Those information mentioned in the movie disappear immediately. People who find these message and buying them certainly never been through a teacher like Fletcher or at least doesn't been through for a long time. I jump to this conclusion because I did, and I know what kind of damage Fletcher's way of education will do to the student for a long period of time. When I was about 10 years old, I had not one but three teacher just like Fletcher for two years. I was in my primary school back in China. Violence is the most usual way of their punishment. we got beaten after we didn't do very well on homework, misbehave on class (usually talking and not paying attention), I once broke my arm during these days. At the time I actually like they use violence, because nothing come close when they decided not to use it. When they insult you they never run short of fancy words even we are just kids. I hope I translate them more correctly so you can understand them better. Ones I have a classmate that didn't do well on their homework about handwriting. The teacher says these word in front of 46 kid: From now on, your name is piece of s**t (my classmate's last name) because your handwriting is s**t. and your parents are big s**t. they should be regret about f**k 10 month before your birthday, because you are not worth it. That is one of the thing they said that I remember the most. and after that, little s**t become his nick name. he accept it and we make fun of it.And humiliation . that is for every one who didn't ""do well"" on their test. Every morning before class. A question well be asked to everyone in the class:""who is the one that get the lowest score?"" after that the kid that get the lowest score will be forced to say:""I am a worthless piece of crap, everything I know is to eat and s**t.""If any of these thing don't make you think about Fletcher, I don't know what will. In fact I fell Fletcher is a saint compare to them. because those kind of torture last 2 years long and I was a 10 year old kid.Here come the worst part.At first those insult works very well. After a long time I start to accept every word they say. Remember I said my classmate accept his nickname little s**t. I start to accept I am a idiot, I cant do anything right, I am worthless and pathetic. Those word don't make me fell I am willing to break the barrier any more. instead they become a relief. An excuse for not doing well. After over 10, I sometime still fell the same way. I find a psychological statement that describe it very well called Learned helplessness. I am no psychologist so someone please tell me if it's true or not.Back to the movie review. I don't think Andrew is making any sense according to my experience. And this movie is a training course for a**holes. 1/10 Good Job for harming the director the most."
"No need for a long review here. I am disappointed and amazed at the overwhelmingly 9 and 10 star reviews for Whiplash from Users and Critics alike. I agree that the performances are great, and for them I give some stars. In spite of the acting the film/screenplay ultimately glorifies cruelty and abuse to achieve success. I mourn the fact that we have become so insensitive to traumatic, inhuman treatment. I might have felt differently if there were rewards for winning over cruelty rather than glorification of bothSadly submitted,Michaellouie"
"This movie is, as every one of the actual musicians here has noted, completely devoid of the reality, and, more importantly, of the JOY, of being a musician. The teacher's ludicrous verbal abuse, which fluctuates between politically incorrect and downright cruel, is so unrealistic and anachronistic in a portrayal of 21st-century educational life that I found it unwatchable. Simmons' character slaps a student repeatedly across the face, with no one gasping or saying a word about it, which had me rolling my eyes, it was like they were saying 1950s movie dialogue about how ""dames"" are dumb and can't drive, or something. I was offended, but I also kind of felt sorry for all involved, it was so... dumb.Beyond insulting my sensibilities as a human, it also insulted me as a musician, an artist. No credible teacher of art or music would think such negative extremes produce genius or even fine musicians. Discipline is crucial to becoming great, but so is flow, listening, and the creativity the truly exceptional experience when ""in the zone"" playing music with other people. This film gives zero sense of why anyone would actually want to become ""Charlie Parker"", I mean, does that mean famous? Parker was an innovator, a physicist of sound, not just some automaton who could play a million notes as fast as possible. It's like this movie was made by people who absolutely don't get why Coltrane makes you feel like you're inside the moon and why a Duke Ellington tune can float you away on the river of your own blood flowing in your veins. Miles Davis was famous for being able to encourage his bands to elevate their playing, I heard Herbie Hancock say that one time when he was blocked on a part Davis just listened and calmly said, ""put a B in the bass"". And everything flowed. No screaming, throwing, åsshølery, but something more masterful: a finely-tuned artist committed to creating greatness, communicating via his mastery of the mysterious, infinite language of music and a deep respect for the people helping him create it.A wasted opportunity to speak to the madness of wanting to be great, to achieve, and also a waste of the dynamic and always fun to watch J.K. Simmons, Watch him in his series Counterpart instead, in a part that displays all his swagger but also the sweetness and humour he mixes in so well."
"I ask you to forgive me if i have taken so long to write a review of Whiplash, but even today i am not sure i can. I do not know how to capture the emotions that build in me when i watch this film. I will do it the other way around.I really do not care for the segments of Andrew(Miles Teller)'s personal life. Yes, they do add a bit of character development, but outside the story. The real development is his development as a drummer. And how Fletcher(Simmons) affects it.I confess that i am a music professional. I went to music school and while the teachers are not like Fletcher, the exaggeration of his character in Whiplash is an expression of the drive that successful musicians truly have.We have all had bleeding fingers, passed out from practicing too much, and putting music above everything else. All these things are true, and i accept that Whiplash exaggerates it to make you SEE what musicians FEEL.Now, on to the production. The photography is superb. I love every camera angle, ever light shot. The direction and dialogue are flawless. Teller has his limits as an actor, but he fits perfectly in this role, and Simmons was born to play the part of Fletcher. I have watched this film 13 times. I decided to give away the DVD because i would have probably watched it many more times again. If you are a musician, you are not complete unless you watch Whiplash.And for the others .. well, Whiplash is a weird film. It might struggle to get its message across to you, or you might simply not be interested or not realize why Andrew is the real winner in the last scene, or what he has accomplished. It breaks my heart, but rules are rules.As this film is aimed at a limited audience, it can only score:9/10 - a monumental masterpiece for anyone involved in music."
"I just can not understand how this movie does get so much acclaim. The whole movie is just so unrealistic. I have learned and practiced 2 instruments here in Europe and can only say when I watch how this Shaffer character treats musicians like football players, this would never work. In such an environment any musician would get so tense and so full of fear to fail, he would certainly do exactly that. This is not how musicality and technique is teached. Never. Music is not sports. What Shaffer does may create a robot band that plays precise like a computer. But the music that comes out that way will sound alike. People in music are sensitive. Teaching is a process of mutual understanding, respecting and elevating between teacher and student.Further, a good drum technique with speed is not achieved by such tensioned convulsion, it needs the right finger and hand control and swing.The acting is certainly admirable but the cuts are sometimes worse then just distracting."
"(biased but educated review from a jazz drummer student)I give 3 points because:-the movie is entertaining (wich for me is a major factor)i take seven because:-The plot is 100% unbelievable.-The idea portrayed here that to get better at jazz drumming (or for that matter any music genre and any musical instrument) you have to injure yourself, suffer psychologically and practice with tension in your hands/arms is exactly the opposite of what playing/practicing jazz drumming is.The only way to get better is practicing relaxed an being constant...improving in baby, but solid steps.-There is a special accent on playing fast as hell as a mean to be considered ""the greatest"", and also indirectly in the importance of reading musical scores, when in reality, jazz drumming is a lot more about feel and dynamics, , creativity, coordination and improvisation (without reading any musicl score at all but knowing the form of the song and listening to the other players to interact in the moment).So the movie is a fiction, but not tagged as if. The only thing that can relate with reality is that it can be considered a caricature of a very turbulent student-teacher relationship. Also can be considered a good way to show teachers and students WHAT NOT TO DO."
"Whiplash is a terrible, unrealistic movie. First of all, of all the musical forms in popular culture, Jazz is one of the most relaxed and organic. The fact that the music director is characterized as disciplinarian is reminiscent of the ""classical"" genre of 60+ year ago (Toscanini, Bruno Walter, etc.), where musical directors ruled with an almost fascist like iron fist. This changed years ago in ""classical"" music and was NEVER the case in Jazz. I am a former professional Jazz and classical musician who studied at top music schools, and creating great Jazz is about relaxing and being in the moment, not being frightened to the point of crying because of an evil music director.Secondly, within the first 20 minutes of the movie, the music director throws a chair at the student and then slaps him!! This is called ASSAULT, and would NEVER happen (or more to the point, be tolerated), in any academic institution, minor or major! Certainly not in the US (or in New York City, as in this case.) This alone completely discredits this movie in my opinion. It's an unrealistic piece of crap that should not ever had been made!! This movie is a discredit to the beautiful art form that is Jazz and an insult to all who teach and play it."
"It amazes me that a movie that promotes such level of fascistic perfectionism gets so much praise. I say fascistic because the sick perfectionism of Nazis was one of the main reasons they thought it is OK to gas millions of people. If you are not perfect based on our standards you don't deserve to live. This movie tells us if you are not Charlie Parker I feel free to humiliate you, insult you, hurt you and abuse you, and it is all justified because if you are Charlie Parker you don't mind this level of sick manipulation. What a disgusting message. Yes, the actors did a good job playing these sick characters, and the movie was well made, which makes it even more dangerous."
"I laughed my head off at every scene in this movie! It was hilarious! The whole thing reminded me of an SCTV skit. I expected John Candy or Martin Short to come out at any second throughout the entire movie. Now I know why musicians and music students are making fun of this movie all over the US. I was a HS music teacher for more than 15 years, and a professional musician my entire life, and I've never seen a funnier movie about music in my entire life. The only one that came close to this was Ken Russell's version of ""Tommy"", but Whiplash took itself much more seriously than Tommy did. People are getting more and more brainless about music every day (especially jazz), so it didn't surprise me that many people thought this was a good movie. I guess I'm not as angry about how bad this piece of garbage was compared to the other people that gave it a bad review, because I waited for it to come out on DVD, and didn't waste a lot of money seeing it in a theater. This would make a great feature on Mystery Science Theater 3000 it's so bad!"
"I was very surprised to see this movie do so well at the Oscars. The movie in a nutshell, to me, is exactly how NOT to teach anyone anything. The story walks you through a jazz class with a Drill Sergeant for a teacher that physically and verbally abuses his student in the name of greatness. The key message is being supportive, respectful and compassionate will get you nowhere. Hitting, abusing and destroying people will make your great! Hollywood for years has been advocating against bullying and now they give not one but three Oscar to a movie that glorifies Bullying??!! I was dumbfounded and sad. Yes, the performance s are great and the actors are very good, but no degree of acting should justify glorifying this method of teaching. What I hated most was that the movie made me like Jazz less. If this is what it takes to have great Jazz musicians then we do not need Jazz. Just to be clear. Hitting, screaming, psychological warfare, abuse and negativity DO not create great people or better musicians. They create abusive, disrespectful human beings that will continue the hate and the abuse. No wonder suicide rates for young people are high; if you are not good enough you are not worth playing, studying, living, etc. Just kill yourself. A very bad message to kids, students and teachers. Dreadful, Hollywood should be ashamed."
"Homophobic and antisemitic insults, psychological and physical torture presented as working methods to motivate a teenager! Do I really need to write more to express how wrong this movie is, despite all the good acting and amazing editing? Since when geniuses and talented artists have all been mentored by a sadistic psychotic maniac that should be locked up straight from the very first slap or insults? it is a SCHOOL. S-C-H-O-O-L.An insult to all worthy teachers and mentors more successful than this Fletcher as NONE of their trainees kill themselves and nevertheless do reach their best.Liking this movie with no restriction at all is being an accomplice of teen suicides."
"Take a cheezy D-list sports movie script complete with the cliché bullying, demeaning coach with the tormented, misunderstood athlete (reality: narcissistic, self-righteous, arrogant, spoiled and immature child who needs to grow up) -- replace these 2 characters with a jazz music ""teacher"" and a drum student at an ""elite"" music academy. Neither character has ANY redeeming qualities - if the writers thought they were creating complex, intricate characters they failed miserably. The ending only shows how pathetic both truly are. I assume the writers (and anyone giving this film a positive review) felt they reached some great epiphany at the conclusion - they didn't. Only a tired out re-tread storyline completely out of proper context. A jazz drum student and music ""teacher"" are not soldiers in boot camp and learning to play drums is not a physically demanding, super- human endeavor as this film tries to lead you to believe.In reality the ""teacher"" is a glorified conductor who thinks he's something special but does nothing but destroy his students desire and passion. He is also an admitted complete failure at his misguided goal of creating another Charlie Parker. The ""student"" is equally self-absorbed and rude excuse for a human being. Only thing positive is he seems to be a pretty decent jazz drummer - but that's it. Character has absolutely ZERO going for him other than that. Other than that he's completely disrespectful and dismissive of everything and everyone else.This film (along with Birdman) sums up how pretentious Hollywood is and the excrement they promote at awards shows to convince themselves they have some higher ""intellect"" or ""artistic genius."" No one will remember Whiplash or Birdman other than as an embarrassing side note in Oscar history (remember Shakespeare in Love, didn't think so - Google it)."
"I'm giving Whiplash a one star rating to compensate for all the rave reviews it has gotten from people who obviously know nothing about about how music is made, and what goes into great performances.Almost the whole film is about the relationship between a talented teen drummer, played by Miles Teller and a teacher, played by JK Simmons, who directs jazz in a top music school. The JK Simmons role is a sick meld of an evil Nazi from WWII, a brutal drill sergeant and a father who is both physically and mentally abusive. His head is shaved, he wears a black ""muscle"" shirt almost continually in the movie, he screams at his students, uses language that makes George Carlin seem like Mr. Rogers, throws chairs, and finally slaps the Teller character in the face, repeatedly. I don't think there is a minority group he does not insult repeatedly, with just about the worst four-letter trash talk imaginable.The fact that the acting is impressive can't save this film. The script is terrible. And it does a disservice to music education in a time when support for the arts is already struggling.Worst of all, the film misrepresents everything that is real in both music and music education. Anyone seeing this film and thinking of going into a music program for the first time would be so turned-off The film is about mind-rape. It is about the worst kind of damage one human can inflict on another in the name of teaching without leaving a great deal of physical damage. It has nothing to do with music, or creativity, or teaching. It is Hollywood at its worse.There are some abusive musical directors who have way too much power, but this fictional character would not last one week in any music school. One student would simply turn on an I-pad, record what goes on, then pass it around.The teacher would be out of a job and most likely in jail.One reviewer called it a ""steaming pile of excrement"". Apt words."
"There's only one thing worse than a ludicrous, shallow, artificial movie, and that's a ludicrous, shallow, artificial movie that everybody seems to adore.Whiplash wants to be about the love of great art, but is actually about the hate of great art. It has JK Simmons - a brilliant actor - playing a disgraceful character, stitched together from completely unrealistic, inconsistent motivations and actions, only conceived to bludgeon the viewer into thinking we're watching something profound. It casually tosses in assault, depression and suicide in a way that only a clueless, opportunistic director could. It has a big finale that would be powerful if only it made some sense for the main characters involved - it doesn't.Even worse, the finale leaves us with this unmistakable message: sadistic leadership is the way to greatness. Don't take your kids to see this."
"Seems to me the only people who like this movie are people who know nothing about music. The film tries to get you to buy into some kind of polished, elite fantasy world that supports our belief that success comes at great sacrifice. Which it sometimes does.. but this movie is absolutely ridiculous.People become musicians out of LOVE for the art. They aren't pushed to ""achieve greatness"" by sadistic asshole teachers. Also, Jazz is far less rigorous and robotic than this movie would have you believe. Jazz (and Blues) have always been about self-expression - play, spontaneity, colour, contrast & emotion. Lots of great jazz players are self- taught and never even went to music school (see Django Reinhardt). Many can't even read music.This (American) movie completely fails to understand one of Americas own greatest cultural exports. As a Brit, I appreciate the irony - I can only conclude the writer must be a total dipshit."
"(Only mild, generalized spoilers ahead, do not worry.) I have played the drums in a Big Band for over 15 years, from my teenage years until well into adulthood. 90% of the time with another drummer, sharing duties. Which is exactly the scenario here, so naturally, i was intrigued by this movie. And it started off promising. A young drummer is eventually invited to practice with a prestigious Big Band. Many of the little details depicted here are pretty much on point.But i cannot begin to describe my disappointment in what unfolded on the screen. The drummer and the band leader (and even the other band members) display such sorry behavior that it becomes tough to endure. You want to raise your voice to the band leader, in place of the drummer and other band members, who fail miserably to stand up for themselves. Instead, you have to endure scenes of bullying and manipulation, and people taking it lying down, like prison inmates going through a boot camp.Only the behavior shown here is worse. The people in this movie are not desperately trying to reduce the length of their prison sentence. Instead, they are desperate for acceptance, for approval, for prestige, for fame. They accept humiliation, they accept being put down, and they do not stand up for themselves. On the contrary. They think that this is alright. They have embodied the whole twisted concept of it all. A society where striving for fame and for outside approval beats any sort of moral values. But shouldn't these values be the most important? To think for yourself and to stand up for yourself, to have values and to defend your values, when people try to coerce you, manipulate you or attack you? But we see people that were brainwashed enough to play along with this farce. Worse, to even support it in a way.If this wasn't troubling enough, what also puzzles me is the overwhelming praise this movie gets by critics and viewers alike. Have we really become so morally degenerated and cynical that this sort of story is now worthy of the IMDb Top 100 Greatest movies of all time? Let me clarify, my objection is not about the production values, the actors (well, a bit), the camera-work or anything like that. It's about the story that's being told, which is the most important part by far, after all.Another thing: This is supposed to depict the act of playing music together, which should be a joyful thing. Playing in a band is a celebration, a give-and-take between the players, an almost sacred and highly social interaction. And a band leader is good when he gives advice, not critique. When he develops people instead of using people. When he motivates instead of manipulating. When he inspires enthusiasm instead of fear. When he is leading, not bossing around. In this movie, they get everything wrong.Overall, i'm thoroughly disappointed with this movie on several levels. I reluctantly have to give this Top 100 movie the lowest score, simply due to the overwhelming urge it gave me to stop watching it."
"Do you know who I am ? "" asks the film's protagonist as the audience are introduced to him Yeah you're that Nazi dude who enjoys raping all the new arrivals at the Oswald State penitentiary . Yes JK Simmons is back playing an Oscar winning role which isn't all that different from the role OZ fans know him for . It's nice to see that this years Oscar nominations were heavily in favour of indie cinema . It's even nicer to know that this is the film my fellow members of this site was the pick of the crop from 2014 film releases so sat back hoping to get blown away by itSo is it any good ? Yes but I should quickly qualify this by stating it's not really the masterwork some people might claim it to be . One criticism THE HURT LOCKER received was that you could easily rework the story as someone who has become addicted to adrenaline . Instead of a bomb disposal man you could have the story involve a fireman who takes more and more risks and so it's the same with WHIPLASH . How about a brutal drill instructor trying to turn weak civvies in to efficient killing machines ? That's already been done a hundred times before and so here we've a reworking of a familiar story in a slightly unfamiliar setting of a music school . It's a slightly predictable story and in order for it not to be so predictable there's a few plot turns involving situations that become rather contrived and unlikely to say the least What stops it all falling apart is director Damien Chazelle using all the tools at his disposal involving editing , sound mix and cinematography to disguise the flaws in the story telling . Certainly many directors nowadays think editing revolves around taking as much cocaine as possible while mutilating any coherent on screen action . The editing style of WHIPLASH is some what showy but is genuinely admirable at the same time . It's nice to actually watch a film and notice the editing while never being irritated by it WHIPLASH is one of the better films of 2014 but it's probably a film that's easier to admire than to like . I did like it but didn't love it and I'm not in a great hurray to watch it again"
"People may quickly picture Whiplash as the Full Metal Jacket of jazz band: there's Fletcher militarily pushing his student, Andrew, to get his task right. The hatred towards the mentor becomes the character's motivation of achieving his orders perfectly; and the similarities could end there. Although this is a very different context; the harsh, shout-y discipline and sometimes its negative human effects are quite reminiscent. But without any grim twists, this movie just sticks directly to one's determination of being successful to his job, either for the instructor or for himself. This is one rough environment that takes you to a relentless study of intense rehearsals and intense discipline until it reaches to the point where their goals lose out of control. And just like those sequences, Whiplash keeps most of the viewers from their comfort zone, and leads them to rewarding results.Movies like this, specifically relationship between a student and a mean teacher, conventionally ends with a heart changing sentiment, possibly leading the two to an unexpected life-long friendship, but Whiplash takes it stone-cold; hardly showing any sign of friendliness in their bond. The only way for the young drummer to gain his own light is to roll with the punches and learn exactly what the band want him to do, even if it costs much of what he has in life. This is supposed to be an image of inspiration, but the film mostly portrays the nightmares of this ""never give up"" ambition; which transforms the dreamer into a mad man who is few steps away of breaking down. Nonetheless, this unending pressure brings real impact to what lesson this movie is trying to show.The filmmaking is spectacular all in all, each of its musical scenes makes for a truly grandeur show, but the core here are the ones that is mainly about the drums. They are impressively played with relentless intensity, while the camera strikingly displays the flowing literal sweat and blood of the drummer; indicating his committed exhaustion. The performances are the spotlight, especially J.K. Simmons who has done perfect to his character. It might have been easy for an overacted performance, but Simmons finds the sense of humanity beneath what it's written, making Fletcher reasonable to furiously shout at any intolerable flaw of his students. Miles Teller also killed it, recognizably for the drumming parts, but aside of that, he convincingly follows through the character's obsession, until he turns closer to insanity.Whiplash often feels cruel, but there is an important reason for that. It depicts a serious way of motivation, you can feel that in every beat of his terrifyingly breathtaking drum performances; this is mostly the reality of being unstoppable to what you are desperately aiming for, plus driven by fear and hate. But eventually, the film makes a clear point why their world of music have to be this bitter. Overall, it all works by choosing clever directions, staging magnificent musical set pieces, and remarkable acting from its two leads. Even if the story is quite simple, its heart tends to overwhelm you."
"Well acted? Sure. Decent directing and production values- yep! Plausible or realistic storyline? Not at all. There is no Shaffer Conservatory. Berklee College of Music in Boston used to be heavy on big-band jazz, but now the school has become far more vocational. None of the conservatory's I am aware of feature jazz as a curriculum, and if they did, it certainly would not be a major. No music professor in the USA would have a job if they behaved the way Fletcher does, and more to the point, no JAZZER would ever behave this way under any circumstances. Jazzers are not confrontational or competitive, that would contradict everything they stand for. The way the other musician behaved and talked in this film is not even remotely accurate AT ALL. Real musicians in REAL life, ESPECIALLY JAZZERS, are brotherly. A professor would never come into another professor's class and take over, would never physically abuse a student or yell at them this way ( with intense profanity, humiliation, and gender-insensitivity). A teacher wouldn't come in and insult the entire ensemble EVER. They would never audition them in the manner Fletcher does. They would never focus so much on the drummer, nor would they put so much emphasis on a stupid and pointless competition. The JVC Jazz festival, like any other jazz festival, does not have label-people attending to scout for new talent like baseball scouts. Labels are overrun with demo tapes and web links to downloads, and his remark that if you screw up they will remember you for the expressed purpose of denying you a deal is absolutely inane.I have NEVER seen a drummer get bloody hands just from playing fast: a stick only weighs about 2 ounces and is very smooth. Oh BTW, drummers never share sticks. Sticks are very personal, and ALL drummers, in a music program, carry a stick bag with them like a woman carries a purse. I have never seen ""alternate"" drummers in an ensemble or page turners for drummer. Big-band rehearsals at 9AM? Are they joking? You'd never get that many musicians to be at class that early and behave like soldiers in bootcamp, NO WAY! Are we to believe that Andrew get tossed from school, before Fletcher, because he messed up playing a song in a competition? Seriously? Even though he was bloody from a car accident? Maybe if this imaginary tale took place in hell, it would have slightly more credibility. Hollyweird NEVER portrays musicians accurately in a feature film. This is not a powerful movie, it doesn't make a point or carry any type of profound message and it doesn't portray musicians or music-schools with an accuracy at all. Im sure its fooled a lot of lay-people."
On the face of it this is an over the top unrealistic portrayal of the odd subject matter where a coach drives his charge to the limit. But that message gets a little confused as the movie progresses.... is he just psycho? Pretty typical of a lot of movies being churned out of the US these days relying an sensational exaggeration and graphic language rather than a good story. The drumming was poor and the drummer no Phil Collins. The general public in the US must be so gung-ho to accept this drivel.... if all you have to be is a loud mouth abusive jerk to get an Oscar then I give up. I warn you... if you have any taste at all you will be disappointed!
"I cannot believe that this film has received so many good reviews. I cannot believe that this film was Oscar nominated for ""Best Motion Picture of the Year"". Here's IMDb's synopsis of the film: ""A promising young drummer enrolls at a cut-throat music conservatory where his dreams of greatness are mentored by an instructor who will stop at nothing to realize a student's potential."" This film, however, is about a bully music teacher who insults, assaults, slaps, degrades, and humiliates his students to death. Literally. This film is realistic only in the sense that it depicts the catastrophic effects bullying can have on people's well-being. Everything else in the film would simply not happen. Other reviewers, with music knowledge, have explained why such music institutions and teaching practices and methods are implausible, nowadays. I am a psychologist and I can verify that bullying will not and cannot motivate a person to become greater. Peoples' potentials are most likely to be crushed as a consequence of bullying. Victims of bullying do not easily ""overcome"" or ""harden up"" to become better human beings. Moreover, victims of bullying tend to become bullies themselves, later on in life. So, I would claim that this is a film about the making of a bully.I am a big fan on violent films and I have felt emotionally exhilarated – completely satisfied – after watching films like Oldboy, and Sympathy for Mr & Lady Vengeance. Whiplash left me feeling disgusted, wondering about what kind of people made it, watched it, and enjoyed it."
"This movie was a terrible, unrealistic, over the top ridiculous waste of time. The only redeeming part was the great orchestral jazz, but the characters, story and, well everything really, means this movie should not be getting the positive reviews it has. Where in the world would anyone be able to get away with treating students like this? It's utterly ridiculous cr** and I cannot believe this was even given approval be made in these days of human rights and anti bullying. What a disgrace. In addition, we found the story so predictable - it was sort of like a REALLY bad Rocky but based on music, except Rocky had heart, soul and a relatable endearing underdog story. All the characters in this were totally unlikeable, unrelatable and awful, who cares what happens to any of them? All in all this is an over-hyped horrible sad attempt at movie making and a great opportunity totally missed."
"As a professional musician of 20 years, I would like to say a little something about this movie and it's odd ""message"". (or lack thereof...)Becoming a great musician takes years and years of hard work and a lot of sacrifice. However, the real process, in real life, looks NOTHING like this movie. The idea that a mentally unstable, psychotically aggressive and (perhaps worst of all) completely INCONSISTENT teacher/mentor like the Fletcher character would be of any actual use to an aspiring musician is pure garbage. It might make for great ""drama"", but it does not reflect how things work in the real world at all. What saddens me is the thought that young aspiring musicians might watch this drivel and think it's an accurate portrayal of what it is to be a ""great"" musician and what you have to do to achieve that greatness. Or even worse, that some aspiring teacher might watch this and be ""inspired"" to follow Fletcher's method of ""teaching by terror"" because of the results it achieves in the movie. In reality ""Fletcher's method"" is flawed. It will not create ""a new Charlie Parker"". It will, in fact, not create any new ""great jazz artists"" at all. With a little luck, it might produce a few semi-useful second row puppets, but that's about it. (And even those guys would likely never get hired, since the asshole mentality that has been drilled into them would make them completely impossible to work with...)"
"This erosion of innocent ideas, like The American Dream, is becoming more and more prominent, especially amongst young people. The success of Damien Chazelle's, Whiplash, is a testament to this. Miles Teller stars as Andrew Neiman, an obsessive drummer who is hell- bent on becoming a great musician. J.K. Simmons stars as Terence Fletcher, the muscled up old teacher who incessantly yells at Andrew and perpetuates his inferiority complex. A large number of High School and University students found this movie to be scarily relatable. Whether it was the memory of an intimating teacher/mentor, or the shared belief that socializing, relationships and 'fun', will impede on one's ability to achieve some kind of success – audiences clearly empathize with this film, and that may not be a good thing.(Spoiler Alert) In the final scene of Whiplash, Andrew and Terence have seemingly buried the hatchet on their old and troubled student/teacher relationship. Andrew agrees to perform at a Jazz concert, under Terence's conducting. When the concert commences, however, the first song that is cued to be played is unknown to Andrew. He realizes that Terence has sabotaged him, and he ultimately leaves the stage. After embracing with his father, who walks over to console him, Andrew returns to the stage. To Terence's bewilderment, Andrew begins playing the drums solo. The scene runs for a while, and as time moves on, Andrew's solo becomes more impressive. Terence eventually accepts Andrew's rebellious action and begins conducting him. In the final seconds of Andrew's solo, Terence looks at him. Although the frame cuts off just below Terence's nose, the film's prior exposition suggests that he either smiled at Andrew, or said, 'good job'. Terence then cues the rest of the band, and the film closes on a loud jazz cadence – cue: credits.This final scene has been a hot-topic of debate in the YouTube and Twitter-sphere. The debate rests on whether or not Whiplash had a 'happily ever after' ending or not. Should the audience be happy that Andrew made his mentor proud, and that he became a great musician? Or should the audience feel melancholic because of what Andrew sacrificed to reach his level of excellence? Has Andrew's story given the American Dream hope? Or has he demonstrated that it will doom you to live a life without happiness?Film critics almost unanimously agree that it was a bitter-sweet ending; Andrew became great, but at the cost of his youth, and possibly his moral compass. Amongst the University student demographic (my demographic), however, there seems to be a disproportionate number of people who interpreted the ending more so as a triumph of ambition and perseverance. For a story about a young man who pushes himself to the brink of implosion, this kind of interpretation should leave older generations wondering what kind of principles of ethics and work life balance their younger counter-parts are embracing.Do not get me confused, I think Whiplash is brilliant – too brilliant. If I am criticizing the film, then that is my criticism. I loved Whiplash. Many other young people loved Whiplash too, but I am beginning to feel that this may be indicative of a warped understanding of success.Films can be much more than weekend entertainment; they are a helpful way to gauge the psyche of a particular target audience. It is a shame that there have not been many social science studies that have attributed film preferences to specific human characteristics; it would be a very helpful variable. For example, if American Psycho has a large cult following, and millions of people still watch and love the film, would it not be fair to say that there are characteristics that the murderous protagonist, Patrick Bateman, has that most viewers within this demographic empathize with? I am not suggesting that these people are all secretly serial killers – however hyperbolic the connection, there must be something about a character or concept that people empathize with that makes the film so enjoyable for them. Similarly, Whiplash's Andrew Neiman must clearly have some element to his character's psyche that most viewers identify with."
"""Whiplash"" on the surface is a tense, complex study of artistic struggle, obsession, and megalomania. I hated it. Not because it wasn't well constructed; not because it wasn't well acted; not because it wasn't well directed, it was all these things and more. No, I hated it for it's heart, its misguided insight into what art and beauty are truly about. It is not lost on me that any discussion or criticism about art could be argued to be completely subjective; I would still say that this movie does not reflect the beauty of art or do credit to the struggle of the artist. Thats not just my opinion either, to me that is a fact. I am not trying to argue an opinion here, I am actually commenting on something that I truly believe. It has been said that ""Beauty is Truth and Truth Beauty"". I believe in Truth and truth can not be an opinion. ""Whiplash"" takes a swing at what it believes is necessary to reach that truth and fails completely at capturing what it means to be an artist. This movie would have one believe that suffering, obsession, sacrifice and ugliness are the building blocks that ""great art/artist"" are founded on. I couldn't disagree more. As an artist myself I understand how all these ""negative"" motivators can drive an artist to produce art, even to produce great art, yet I feel this movie celebrates them as a necessary right of passage. That in order to be great one has to work harder; it implies that those who are successful are those who have suffered and sacrificed the most, and those who aren't just didn't try hard enough.(How many great artist has history ignored only later to discover their beauty?) Perhaps most disturbingly It implies that one's self worth is dependent upon the reception of their art by an audience or someone outside themselves. Enter the ""evil"" music/art instructor who's job it is (by this movies logic) to push someone past what they think is possible to open up new untapped potentials hidden away by psychological blocks of complacency and self-pity by employing the tools of cruelty, manipulation and terror. All this hidden behind some BS ideal that their is some great nobility inherent in not depriving the world of a great artist no matter what the cost. GAG!! What overblown melodramatic tripe. I don't argue that we all couldn't use a swift kick in the pants occasionally in order to rise to our potential,or that honest criticism can be crucial to progressing as an artist but to ruthlessly and doggedly bully and torture someone in the hopes of achieving said effect is where i take offense. Who the hell gave him that cross to bare anyway!? There is a line. This movie even mentions this ""line"" at one point and comes really close to reaching a redemptive conclusion....then misses the mark entirely and descends into the abyss. At this point the movie could have had some valid commentary on the consequence of tyranny and obsession and lifted itself to having a message worth sitting through. I had a glimmer of hope that the movie""s heart was true and had been enact all along. Unfortunately this was not to be. The scene that twists the knife comes when; after being set up and sabotaged by Fletcher, Andrew rises to the occasion against all odds and puts on the performance of a lifetime. Had he done this despite the villainy of Fletcher and the movie just ended, then one could have left the movie with a certain ambiguity, open to contemplating the various themes and questions the movie raises about art and the artistic process. However the damning evidence of the movie's actual message comes during Andrew's fevered solo when despite everything Fletcher has done to Andrew there is a nod of acknowledgment from Fletcher that conveys the approval that Andrew has been so desperately seeking and the movie ends as if something triumphant and beautiful has been brought into the world. Uunnghhh! Never mind that Andrew is an obsessive with no sense of self (or self worth), never mind that Fletcher is a maniacal, narcissistic power drunk bigot (who may have even played a hand in pushing a young mind to suicide), never mind that there seems to be no consequences for any of these characters in their pursuit of greatness. No at this point the movie decided to celebrate this twisted moment as a triumph of art and truth. As if tormenting a person is how great art is born. No I don't think it is cool to celebrate this message nor do i think it is healthy to celebrate Fletcher's and Andrew's relationship as justified and productive. As an artist it offends me with its clichés, I feel it lacks insight, responsibility and any awareness as to the very purpose of art. Art doesn't have to be beautiful, art can be dark. It is both and it is neither. Art is truth and that is all I would ever ask of any form of expression. In ""Whiplash"" I got pandering, ""Top Gun""-esque melodrama and a self indulgent study in cruelty that pretentiously masquerades as if it knows what it means to be an artist. (2 stars for the undeniably fine craftsmanship and performances, but on those alone does not a good movie make.) -Sizer"
"Having spent most of my entire life in music playing drums and teaching the art, I can tell you that there are so many things wrong with this movie, it's laughable. The absurd, over-the-top, face-slapping scene in the trailer was enough for me to avoid seeing it. But, at the urging of a friend - a non-musician who thought it was ""great"", I caved in to my curiosity. His taste in movies aside, he's still my friend, and I was right in my initial judgement. Watching the entire movie was a waste - I made it half-way through and ditched.""Whiplash"" is an unadulterated load of crap."
"I admired the cinematography and the acting, and at the start, thought this would be a great film. But then the bullying and violence started... The first episode was shocking but gripping, and I wanted to find out where the film was leading. It turned out to be leading up a blind alley. The sadistic teacher was a ridiculous stereotype, the bleeding hands were just plain unbelievable, and all the other members of the band just sat around watching but not reacting to the appalling abuse. This method of 'teaching' wouldn't work; there is a big difference between pushing students to achieve more and violent bullying. And the idea that such violence and aggression could lead to students producing better music of all things, would be laughable if it wasn't so sick. I was tempted to walk out but watched till the end, hoping for some kind of balance or note of realism. Unfortunately, there wasn't one and the final triumphant performance merely seemed to validate the cruelty. Yes, the cinema audience clapped at the end, and that made my stomach turn."
"I expected from this film much more then I saw. I think music is not about military discipline and swearing, it is just the opposite. How important is for a drummer to play his drums fast? Not that important. I think this film was made more for the actors and music editors then for the music itself. What a disappointment! It is also disappointing to see that this film took more Oscars then Boyhood. It is sickening! I really would like to add that I really expected more about this film then it delivered to me. I am sorry but I would not recommend this film for you to see. It is just so disappointing."
"This film is a tightly wound watch. It's perfect in it's execution, and always intentional. The shots, the pace, and the motivations all flow into each other. Do yourself a favor a allow this ode to ambition to draw you in."
"If this were to be a parody about success and how to achieve it, it would receive 10 stars from me. Unfortunately it is not and the high ratings it has achieved baffles me.Firstly, let me state that I do not understand music from a professional or enthusiast's point of view.In my opinion, the movie portrays music as a mastery of some technical skills, following a fixed(or slight variation thereof) tempo. It removes anything remotely positive involved in learning or teaching music. The main characters throughout the movie were only involved in inflicting pain on themselves or others in order to satisfy their ambitions.Secondly, no character development or a back story. All the characters came out the same at the end of the movie as they were in the beginning. The only change being Andrew could play better(yippe!).Thirdly, definition of success (of being a 'Great') and the path to it. The movie portrays success as a neurotic obsession with ambition(never music - never got that feeling, always about being up there) and a desire for proving people who have humiliated you as wrong as the road to it! What is wrong with people? In my opinion succeeding at something requires true passion and love for it. Yes pushing ourselves is required along the way, but if the entire journey consists of it, the feelings with which we will reach the other end would be a far cry from sunshine and rainbows.In brief the entire movie consists of a sadistic instructor fishing for a student who does not break when methods resembling whack-a-mole are employed and succeeding(YAY!)."
"The main argument of this film is that music is like a sport. You have to put yourself to the limit to be a top player. And this is not true for music. Music is all about feeling and soul and touch audience with the performance, not to be able to play at 400 BPM. Being a musician is an inner path to lead to a self discover. Virtuousness come with the practice and talent, but not being assaulted physical and emotionally. Music is an art, not a competition, so is subject to be interpreted in many ways, so being a best musician is not matter of math or time clock. Jazz is a language, not a race. Photography and editing are superb in the film, that's the only thing I liked."
"Throwing a chair, slapping a music student repeatedly in front of his class in rehearsal simply because the teacher doesn't know how to teach rhythm. This movie brings the art of music down to the level of sports sadly. There are already enough bad teachers out there, we don't need a training film for them. The guy isn't a ""hard teacher"", he's just an asshole. Anyone knows that a good teacher can solve simple problems like this very quickly and knows that hitting a student isn't the answer. But this screenplay is an amateur work and sought out this method to evoke drama than showing someone who was a real teacher who was passionate about the craft and found a better way to work with students. But hey, showing a kid get slapped around gets you off, then this hazing film is for you. It's sure to play on your Picure-in-Picture along side wresting with you and your buddies pausing to say, ""Wait...watch this..."" and the kid gets slapped and they all say, ""awesome!"" and have another beer. Too bad IMDb doesn't allow zero stars. Who green-lighted this project, someone's family have a lot of money to fund it? Who's paying for all this over the top reviews of this piece of trash?"
"Filmmakers have paid for positive reviews for decades before IMDb, and I can't think of a way for IMDb to protect against false or paid input.Consider with WHIPLASH, this film proved nothing but limp at the box office, not to be found anywhere in the top 100 for 2014, yet there are 176,500 votes for it on IMDb and most are for 10, 9, or 8.Then consider this is unoriginal, badly acted, boring film.The hero wants to be the World's #1 musician. Fine! So he gets J V Simmons to scream obscene language in his face and plays his drums until his hands bleed (Ridiculous!) Let me tell you about course language. Any idiot can excel at it. King size fools like the J V Simmons character have nothing else to offer; else-wise they could communicate without it.The boy still goes to the movies with his Dad. Sweet! At the movies they distinguish themselves by adding Milk Duds to the large tub of popcorn and blabbing through the show, making other people move away.Later, he masters the courage to date the pop corn girl and takes her for pizza. Wow! This adds substance to the later scene when he dumps her because he needs the time for his music.There is just nothing original or interesting going on here.Whiplash is one of the very worst films of 2014. IMDb would be so much better if it was kept honest and clean. I hope the producers enjoyed the $1.60 we paid to rent the DVD, but next time I'll think twice before choosing anything from Sundance."
"I can't believe that people rate this movie so highly and I can't believe that this crap was nominated as Best Picture of the Year. All I can say is that I am so glad it didn't win. I'm not even sure I am glad that J.K. Simmons won an Oscar. This movie is bad from beginning to end and totally unbelievable. I'm not a musician and I don't even like Jazz, but I'm sure no music school would employ or tolerate a teacher like Fletcher. People would report him much sooner than it is portrayed in the movie. There are other scenes that discredit this film. For instance, when Andrew, the student, has the auto accident, he walks away from it with hardly any injury (although the car overturned) and makes it just in time to the music hall for the concert. Yeah, give me a break! Fletcher is a sadistic prick, but we are supposed to believe he is moved to tears when he talks about a former student who killed himself? Total nonsense! What really irritated me is that the Fletcher character is so surreal and disgusting, and that Andrew, the student, is so obsessed. Any normal person would have quit or at least reported the teacher, but no, we have to endure this ""drama"" until the ""glorious"" end. I found the solo so boring, I couldn't wait to get out of the theater. I only went to see this horrible film because it was nominated as best picture. I praise all the brave people who wrote a bad review... this movie deserves it."
"It's not as boring as 50 Shades of Grey, but it's just about as simplistic. There are two characters, plus a couple of others are hinted (at with several seconds of screen time).I loved the music. The acting was good, but the roles were not especially nuanced.The main problem is that within the first couple of minutes of the film, you know Andrew's goal: to be an elite drummer. Great. You also realize that his instructor is complete jerk (or worse) and is going to ""challenge"" Andrew. So, for the rest of the movie, all we have to wonder about is whether he'll end up overcoming the challenge and being a good drummer, or whether he'll give up.It kept my attention, but I would never watch this movie a second time. There just wasn't enough substance to it. There was no nuance. There was nothing more to think about.The pseudo-philosophical, pop-psychological discussion in the movie about whether abusive treatment by a teacher is justifiable by the potential for producing greatness are just pathetic and empty.There are some shades of side-story. There's a paper-thin character of a girlfriend. She only exists to make us believe that Andrew might be giving something up by pursuing his goal, but since Andrew isn't likable at all, I didn't really care if he ended up with her.Anyway, the movie wasn't really a 1 star... I give it a solid 6.5, but since it's been voted so high here on IMDb, I'm just trying to bring it down into the realm of reality."
"Hard to rate this film because there's so much to like - the performances, the unusual story-line, and the fact that it's about jazz. Still what stays with me is what I liked the least about the movie - the fact that Fletcher's torturous and reprehensible methods seem to be validated in the end. I really wished the kid would have succeeded in spite of Fletcher and showed him that his methods only cause irreversible damage and sometimes even death. Abuse is not the way to make talent (artistic or otherwise) blossom - McCartney, Spielberg, Federer, Bach, Evert, Picasso, Da Vinci - there are countless examples of genius without without abuse. Maybe jazz is different? I doubt it."
"Note that Erskine lauds equal measures of love and enthusiasm, discipline and toughness. Innumerable cultural think pieces over the last decade have rightly criticized the millennial-parental mindset of ""everybody gets a trophy."" And Simmons' Terence Fletcher deftly skewers the kind of thinking that leads only to universal mediocrity: ""There are no two words in the English language more harmful than 'good job.'""In the end, though, Fletcher/Simmons produces a drum machine, not a musician, an artist, or a better human being. Virtuosity and technical excellence devoid of personality and self-expression—that ineffable quality we call ""soul""—is meaningless. And because of that, Whiplash, a 106-minute look at the act of making music, ultimately is one of the most anti-music, anti-art films I've ever seen. So no, ""hate"" is not too strong a word."
"Whiplash is simply astonishing.Miles Teller plays Andrew, a gifted and highly ambitious drummer in his first year at an elite New York music academy. There his talents are spotted by Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), an equally ambitious coach and mentor who is always looking for the ""next big thing"" but has never found it. However, there is a very thin line between being an ""ambitious coach"" and a terrifying bully, and Fletcher constantly crosses that line sometimes inflicting a terrible impact on his young students.In an almost uniformly male environment, love interest is served from the cinema concessionary stand by Nicole (the charming Melissa Benoist) who the shy and uncertain Andrew finally plucks up the courage to ask out on a high-point in his emotional roller-coaster. Spot the female, featuring Melissa Benoist The 'school for protégés' theme has perhaps been trodden before by movies like Alan Parker's ""Fame"", and some of the emotional and creative jostling of elite musicians has appeared in films such as 2012's ""A Late Quartet"". But none of these deliver the degree of passion and intensity metered out in Damien Chazelle's movie.Miles Teller (""Divergent"") is superbly credible as the aspiring jazz drummer Andrew, and it is almost unbelievable that he was not a professional drummer-turned-actor for this film. In fact, the more accomplished jazz drummer (very different to rock drumming apparently) is Nate Lang who plays Carl, his key competitor for the ""percussion 1"" role. The two were apparently locked away in a drumming 'boot camp' for 2 months prior to the movie being filmed.But the starring role in the film goes to J.K. Simmons, probably best known in the supporting role of J. Jonah Jameson, the cranky editor of the Daily Bugle in the Spiderman films (and a number of other Marvel spin-offs). Simmons is quite simply astonishing, channelling the sort of Oscar-winning performance of Louis Gossett Jnr (""An Officer and a Gentleman"") into his vicious drill-sergeant-style performance. He has been nominated in the Best Supporting Actor role for both Golden Globe and BAFTA awards, and I would fully expect him to feature in the Oscar shortlist when they are announced on January 15th. Personally speaking, he will be the one I will be cheering for in the awards themselves.Cinematography by Sharone Meir is outstanding, with every drop of blood, sweat and tears glistening on forehead and cymbal. The editing by Tom Cross is also extremely tight, winding up the tension during key encounters. The combination of the two together with Chazelle's tight script effectively spears the audience in the gut. The feature is based on Chazelle's short film of the same name, and on this basis he is a name to watch for the future.Gut-wrenching and enthralling, this film will spit you out the other end feeling emotionally drained. This is simply a film you MUST see. Let me drum it into you again. GO SEE THIS FILM! (If you liked this review please see others at bob-the-movie-man.com and sign up to receive future posts).

"Serial Abusing, Manipulating, Emotional Torture, Causing Anxiety and Fear, Playing a huge role in the death of someone and causing another one almost to die.If this is YOUR idea of inspiring and bringing about greatness in a novice performer then this movie is for you.For me, I could not digest it at about 60% through. Its amazing that how could this movie get so many good reviews and could be nominated to so many awards?.Further ironically this movie is supposed to show Fine Arts and it is amazing that such a personality could be expected to even know about it."
"This film reminded me of my high school band instructor who brutalized a number of students. Some had to be hospitalized and developed symptoms that debilitated them for life. One of the trombone players lost his front teeth when the instructor threw a metal chair at him, complaining that he wasn't in tune. Later, he told us he was only kidding, and that if the trombonist didn't know he wasn't in tune then he deserved it. Nobody ever thought they were out of tune again because they didn't want their teeth knocked out. One day he threw a cymbal at one of the alto sax players and cut into his thigh, severing an artery. He was later hospitalized and still has a limp. The instructor said he did it because he heard Charlie Parker was named ""Bird"" because he had a cymbal thrown at him, which makes no sense to me but what do you expect from a psychotic band instructor? He swore like a sailor too. I later found out he was in rehab for methamphetamine abuse. I'm so glad I gave up the trumpet. The heck with a music career, those people are crazy."
"I went into the theater to watch Whiplash with very little knowledge of the film other than it's about a drummer.I enjoyed the first 30 minutes or so of the movie and wondered which direction it was going to go. Obviously, something was going to happen between the music instructor and the drum student but what?The movie ended up being primarily based on their relationship, which basically focused on excessive practice and verbal abuse. The movie failed to capitalize on other relationships such as with the drummer's girlfriend, or relationship with his dad or fellow students. Two other student drummers suffered through the same abuse and you'd think that even though they were competing for the same spot, they'd bond on their hatred for the instructor.The only interesting scene dialog wise was really the family dinner which was funny yet short. Almost all of the other dialog in the film was the instructor yelling.The final 30 minutes of the movie didn't sit well with me at all. The student and instructor meeting in the bar and talking over drinks was unlikely seeing how the student hated the man. I don't believe the student would've given him the time of day after what transpired.Then the instructor, who for the entire film was 100% set on protecting his reputation intentionally tried to embarrass the drummer in front of a huge theater that also had people with connections to the industry. I don't believe the instructor suddenly would've been OK with potentially negatively affecting his already tarnished reputation just to ruin the drummer's chances after the student had already made the decision to give up his dream.The final scene where the drummer and instructor/conductor seemed to come to terms also seemed unlikely.In the end, there wasn't enough dialog and the relationship with most of the characters didn't go deep enough to make it a great movie in my mind."
"Wow, where to start? Well first of all, there are two characters in the film, two! The stupid romance thing was unnecessary and very forced.And oh my god the teacher throwing chairs at kids and slapping them?? Ridiculous and unrealistic.And why didn't the teacher ever yell at anyone else except for Teller's character?? He only did it once and that was just to assert his dominance to the audience, which was very very very obvious. Why was the teacher just angry at the quiet drummer??So so so unrealistic on all aspects and I just wanted this terrible production to end.And what was up with them bleeding after drumming too hard? As a friend of a drummer, I know that no matter how hard you played, if you were a good drummer you would never start bleeding.Terrible"
"The fact that this movie has earned high rating from its audience is understandable - in the end, a bad sadomasochistic taste of mass audience is no longer a secret. What surprises me is critical acclaim - it seems that critics aren't gotten far ahead from the public for which they write.As for the movie, it is grotesque, stupid sado-masochistic fiction, indulging bad taste and low inclinations of its viewers.Most sad thing is that someone not to bright might decide that this degenerative movie is actually depicting reality and will try to bring such kind of decay into the real life. From the other side, actual maniacs and degenerates might see this movie as an indulgence to their actions. Well, now I probably understood who those critics with positive reviews on this movie are :)3 out of 10."
"There are multiple reasons why Whiplash comes to the Toronto International Film Festival with palpable anticipation. The film was showcased at this year's Sundance Film Festival where it went on to both the Audience Award and Grand Jury Prize award for best dramatic film. Actor Miles Teller was recently named as one of Variety's 10 Actors to Watch and J.K. Simmons, well, he's J.K. freakin' Simmons. So the gathering audience at the afternoon screening was primed, ready and eager for the expected greatness about to be screened.Whiplash stars Miles Teller as Andrew Neyman, a determined 19-year-old drummer who is pushed to his emotional limits by his new instructor Terence (J.K. Simmons). Terence has a reputation for being the best, but mentoring under his tutelage comes at a price. Terrence is no Mr. Miyagi. He is ruthless in his barrage of verbal sewage that attempts to push his students towards the greatness he believes they can achieve. Newcomer Andrew is no spared his ire as evidenced in this heated reaction when Andrew can't find Terence's tempo, , ""Were you rushing or were you dragging? If you deliberately sabotage my band, I will gut you like a pig. Oh my dear God - are you one of those single tear people? You are a worthless pancy-ass who is now weeping and slobbering all over my drumset like a nine year old girl!"" There is no ""Wash-on, Wash-off"" PG-ness here.Being mean is in Terence's nature. And his assault on his young protégés is sometimes hard to watch. Think of Gunnery Sargent Hartman in Full Metal Jacket and imagine the persistent yelling and abuse for an entire film. Throughout, Andrew remains resilient. His goal to become a drummer of future legend has him shun friends and family. He's all alone and the uncomfortable Terence bond that he creates is all that he has.Audiences will be unsure of where Whiplash is headed. Are we headed for a triumphant climax where the drill sergeant-esque nature of the instructor pays off in a musical crescendo closing that brings audiences to their feet? Or will the pressure and barrage of verbal bullying take effect with a shocking tragedy that spotlights the harassment of our children. Be sure, this is no Mr. Holland's Opus and the hate and evil that Terence employs travels from opening to closing credits without reprieve.Writer-director Damien Chazelle does a stunning job of keeping us on the edge of our seats wondering when or if a climatic breakdown will occur. We watch in awe as Andrew gets pushed and pushes himself until his hands bleed after hours of relentless play. We feel as uncomfortable for his situation as we feel trapped in finding a solution to Andrew's goal.The concluding act only further exemplifies the events and personalities that took us to the stage and the audience cheered in Andrew's defiance while gasping at his situation.The result is a fantastic film that is sure to be considered for Best Picture at next year's Academy Award's. It is a rousing crowd pleaser will have audiences clapping with hands they will want washed of Terence's abuse. J.K. Simmons has the role he was meant to play and his character was not only brilliant but could rank as one of the best cinematic villains of all-time."
"On 13 November Whiplash – directed by Damien Chazelle starring Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons – will premier at the Netherlands cinema. This movie about an ambitious and talented drum player and his dominant, relentless teacher, is expected to do well, based on the positive reception it had in many countries and at several festivals. Even before its release the movie opened the Leiden International Film Festival, and won the LIFF Indie Competition. General appreciation is also shown at IMDb, where the film scores 87/100 with about 4400 votes.The story that the movie brings forward is not new. Andrew, a young drum player, enrolls at the high-class, well-reputed Shaffer Conservatory, where he meets Fletcher, an infamous teacher working with high standards and non-compromising methods. Andrew attracts his attention and a struggle between the two characters begins when Andrew secures the position of first drum in the school band practicing for the national school competition. The movie focuses on the two main characters, and the way in which they interrelate with the aim to realize the best drum performance for the school's honor, but more so for their own prestige and ego.Although the movie excels in cinematography, acting and music – provided you at least like some level of jazz music – the story doesn't seem to convince. The strict focus on the two men and their sole purpose leads to repetition in the narrative, following the cycle of insult and pressure from the teacher, hard work and pain by the student, and short-term victory for both when a performance succeeds. Even at the end of the movie, when things seem to turn around, the teacher again tries to push the student into a great performance, which he indeed delivers.Additional characters, such as the student's father, girl friend or other musicians at the school, are just there to support the main story. They never get any depth or backgrounds, and their role is minimal; they are there to underline how determined and ambitious Andrew really is. The school functions as decor, with musicians as extra's and no sign of a board, other teachers or school infrastructure.Focusing on one aspect of a human relationship can produce interesting and compelling movies, but Whiplash is not a good example. Besides the elimination of all surrounding factors, there is another possible reason why the story doesn't convince me. The general idea underlying the story is that real talent blossoms with hardship and pain. Consequently, the message is delivered that it is good to bully and mistreat a student with talent, so that he or she gets to full development. To my mind this message is not true, at least not always, and needs more justification than a flat, straight story about two egocentric men struggling for power and recognition."
"This is a very unique movie even u are not into jazz but still can drew u into the atmosphere of it without moving your eyes.My eyes were dry after seeing this movie.Miles and Jk portray it flawless .Jk remind me of ex employer will use your weakness background against you if anything go wrong.Director done very well using camera angle to capture the face of the actor to create the tension in it.Have to admit I hate Fletcher brutal teaching, but most of the music icons were pushing to their limit practice to perfectly everyday,so he is not entirely wrong also.just my fantasy,it will be great if this movie can use 120fps technology to capture the facial expressions of two lead actors."
"Wiplash is a movie that was praised by critics, and i´m agree, is a very good movie,and the J.K Simmons performeance is amazing, J.K Simmons is one of my favorite actors.The movie is about a young drummer, maybe this could sound boring,but is not,something that i like very much is that the movie is very realistic to some extent,give you the message that without pain there is no gain,and that is 100 porcent true.The main character suffer ,and you don't realize,because the movie doesn't victimize the characters and that´s something good. It's very different movie than the ones I've seen, I loved this movie,but the problem is that the movie sometimes is a little exaggerated, like when Andrew is crashed by a car and even though this bleeding is going to touch the concert. Look i don´t have any trouble in which the movie has only two main characters, the problem is that they doesn't have much personality,we know that both like music and well thats it.In conclusion Whiplash it's an outstanding movie but it's not perfect"
"Top-notch camera work and top-notch JK Simmons. Tension stays high throughout the whole movie, and many twists keep the story from being predictable. Execution is well above average.
While it's surley entertaining, I think Whiplash lacks some depth. When the credits roll, you will find out that the story arc is very linear, and there's no enlightenment in it. At the and of day, this story is about grit and endurance, and nothing else. 6.5/10."
"""A promising young drummer enrolls at a cut-throat music conservatory where his dreams of greatness are mentored by an instructor who will stop at nothing to realize a student's potential..."" or so the description goes. In reality, though, the only thing Fletcher - the ""band leader"" - wants to do is destroy anyone with more talent than he, which includes about everyone else after hearing his attempt to ""play jazz""near the end of the film. (Truly awful, mediocre and banal. And, NOT jazz!) Fletcher is a one-dimensional combination of Mo'Nique's character in Precious and Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) from Amadeus. His intent is to destroy talent, not nurture it, especially when he runs across what he considers real talent. His motivation is pure envy. His character is not only a complete fraud and liar - Charlie Parker's nickname ""Bird"" came from his childhood, long before he picked up his first sax and had nothing to do with a ""cut session"" later in life - he's a psycho-sadist who has no business ""teaching"" anyone anything.Those of us who truly love jazz gag at every reference to Buddy Rich. Rich, while a remarkably talented drummer technique-wise, was no jazz drummer. He simply didn't have the soul and he knew it, which goes a long way in explaining his recording studio antics. He, too, was a jealous, egotistical jazz wannabe, much like Fletcher.The editing of this film reminds me of ""film school 101"" where the first assignment in editing class is to cut a piece of film to music. It's amateur at best. End of story.But rarely have I seen a film where one scene was so completely out of place that, in retrospect, it completely undermines any positive intention the film may be attempting. I'm talking about the dinner table scene, where Andrew's father humiliates him in front of family and friends gathered for a meal. The dad's later declaration that he ""would do anything"" to protect his son from abuse rings as hollow as the film itself. That entire scene should have been left of the cutting room floor. It did nothing for the film except destroy the narrative, the characters truthfulness, and the overall ""theme"" of the film itself, although I'm not quite sure the director, writers, actors, etc, were actually aware of what they were attempting to achieve.One glaring ""oops:"" Fletcher is hired to conduct a JVC gig at Carnage Hall - probably by bullying someone. He invites Andrew to play the drums (seems he needs a drummer on short notice). But honestly, would someone in this position actually organize such a prestigious event without having a back-up drummer just in case Andrew fails to show? I think not. But, that's what happens. And, it's a mess.Thankfully, this ""film"" has an antidote in The Theory of Everything, a great film about a true genius and what it takes to nurture one to fruition. Whiplash cannot fall into the abyss of obscurity soon enough as far as I'm concerned. Oh, and the soundtrack sucks, big time. Jazz? Not even close."
"This film winning all kinds of awards shows what's wrong with this world.The grotesque rehearsal situations and even are completely boring, all the violence and the excessive exhibition of power is so over the top I had to giggle sometimes. The sado-masochistic undertone reminds me of people which are stuck in their puberty and are hanging on to self-created supervisors to get the punishment they need to feel satisfied. The story line is completely crooked, the characters are shallow and all this film does is praise a facistoid masculism.This film is basically Hitler and fails even to deliver to his self-assigned standards. Not even the music was good.1 star."
"I knew from the trailer that the movie wouldn't be a nice movie leaving you with some happiness afterwards. However, I've seen most other movies that has come out lately so I had nothing else to watch and gave it a chance. I very rarely write reviews and usually just rate the movie, however this movie is so sadistic that it needs to be reviewed for other peoples safety.First of all, I used to be a drummer myself. The quality of the drumming and choice of music is fantastic. The actors are doing great except that the attention was towards the two main characters the whole movie. This gave the feeling that all the other characters were just put there to help show the personality of the two main characters. The drummer is an insecure, self centered teenager seeking for glory and the mentor is an sadistic, bullying psychopathic conductor justifying his methods with that they give result. The student struggles getting recognized by the conductor but somehow finds his glory and happy ending. I worry about the students future in this fictional world. He will probably kill himself in a couple of years as an another student of this conductor did.This movie didn't leave me either happy, relieved, inspired or anything similar. If you wish to not feel good afterwards, its an excellent movie for you. I worry people think bullying people into success is justified if it gives results since people made such positive reviews. It saddens me people like and supports movies which glorify bullying. I hope this review gives another perspective to the movie since most reviews were very positive."
"I'll be brief.Although the soundtrack is nice (if you like jazz) Both the characters and the story are unreliable. For once, a real music teacher with such character would have had his ass kicked out of school pretty quickly.So, it's kinda like ""Fame"" - only the jazz version that takes itself way too seriously!Also, J.K. Simmons character is not too far from his previous 'Schillinger' role. Only this time - he got out of (Oz) jail and decided to turn his anger and neo nazi tendencies into music.Bottom line (only because IMDb requires at least ten lines) - much much overrated."
"Awful waste of time. The same end result (the amazing drum performance by the kid) could have been accomplished a lot faster and effectively with positive reinforcement. They way the bald bastard teacher physically and verbally abuses his students is plain disgusting. A clear example of exaggeration to give the story line a greater climax. A F#$%ING TRUCK crashes right into his car as he puts his phone down in the car. He shakes of the injuries (bloody arm, head, and face) and runs to his class to join Fletcher's performance. The acting can't be taken seriously, instead of being pulled into the movie, the Fletcher's bad acting and ""over exaggerated"" teaching style made me close the movie 30 minutes in. Please don't waste your time watching this over sensationalized rendition of ""true"" events."
"Seems almost everyone likes this movie for some reason. My review will be short and sweet: This is the dumbest premise for a movie I've ever witnessed. This is ""Full Metal Jacket"" with drums. No one, and I mean NO ONE would put up with the abuse that this music teacher dishes out, unless they were in the Marine Corp. It's one thing to be a nasty music teacher, but quite another to be R. Lee Ermey as Gunny Sgt. Hartman. Every kid I know today would have pounced on Fletcher and beat him to a pulp if he acted this way towards them. I keep waiting for Andrew to turn into Pvt. Leonard 'Gomer Pyle' Lawrence with a rifle in his hand to blow the teacher away. No, this is beyond fantasy, this is just dumb."
