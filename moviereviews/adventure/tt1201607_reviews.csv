"What can I say... This was by far the most amazing finale any fan could have asked for. I cried, I laughed, I was short of breath in many instances, I was disturbed, but overall I was thoroughly satisfied with the conclusion of this series. I felt something amazing after the movie ended, something I didn't feel after reading the book. Being able to watch the end of Harry Potter on the big screen really brought the impact of just how much this series has touched not only my life, but the lives of everyone around me. Deathly Hallows Part 2 is by far (in my opinion) the best movie of 2011 and quite possibly one of the best movies of all time. I don't want to give any spoilers I just want to express how happy I am with this film. It picks up where Part 1 left off, all of the characters get the closure they deserve, and the story just comes full circle!BRAVO!!! That is all I have to say. Thank you to everyone involved in these movies for taking the world on such an amazing journey. J.K Rowling, thank you for writing such a masterpiece that will truly live on in my heart, and so many others hearts for years to come.Go see this movie!"
"At the start of J.K. Rowling, thank you for this wonderful series of books forever. I can tell you this current state of my childhood and my future. Sign up everywhere it has always been a part of Harry Potter's name. I'd say the most important series of my life. I owe my childhood such wonderful pass to the books and movies of this series. In this series, even though I know better than the series it has always been a special place for me in this series and it will always continue. This movie is definitely the best in the series. And the players is the most mature film. You feel throughout the film until the end of the final air and this is an amazing thing for fans like me. Book series as well as certainly never did. However, in each film it was pretty cool. And with incredible finale made this film. Harry certainly kept the best for last. Put all the music from the beginning to the end of the movie you are very successful and internal chills. You feel deeply cool is really going on. When the film ended up being a very big gap within you. Of course, you are a part of this world..."
"The conclusion to the series hits some of the strongest emotional beats, mainly due to our long-standing connection with the characters, and provides some grand visual treats in the form of extended magical battles. While 'Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (2011)' may be the biggest in scale and it is entertaining, it does feel lacking in depth - since some things are left oddly unexplained - and instead comes across as an extended third act for its duration. It actually plays out like one long climax, with little of the build-up required to further invest the audience, but at least it's well paced and doesn't hang about. A strong note on which to end a phenomenal series. 8/10"
"I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter books, they're all so great and magical. But I didn't think the film series were perfect at all, but they were still great movies. With that, I was extremely excited to see the end of the film franchise, and impressed with the trailers. So I had high expectations. And thankfully it did not disappoint, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II, blew past my already high expectations and I was enthralled!The whole movie looked spectacular! The cinematography extremely well done, the art direction was incredible. The movie was beautiful to look at, the visuals were spectacular and truly Oscar worthy! The set designers, cinematographers really need to be awarded for their work, because it looks like they spend of time and money on the look of the film. The cast of the film was pretty much perfect, they should all be applauded too. Emma Watson, as usual is and great and she'll have a bright career ahead of her. Rupert Grint is pretty much great also, he is a fine actor indeed. Daniel Radcliffe did an amazing job and was very memorable as Harry Potter. Although I think Ralph Fiennes was the star of the film, he did unbelievable job as the evil, crazy Lord Voldemort, I think he deserves an Oscar Nomination for his role. The rest of the cast were also great too.We all grew up overtime with the series, we followed the adventures of Harry Potter for around 10 years, I think. It seems very weird that there will be no more Harry Potter films to look forward too. I will miss the franchise very much! However I am happy the series got an amazing ending. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II is not only the best film in the series, but it will probably be one of the best films of 2011. Everyone should see this film, even if they don't like past Harry Potter films."
"I saw this at a preview screening in London.Deathly Hallows part 2 ends this incredibly well produced saga with tremendous grace and a beautifully orchestrated climax that I am sure will satisfy both lovers of the books and films.If you have read the books as I have you will be glad to know major key moments are intact. Much is missing but I won't dwell on that, no point, its how well this movie plays out and for me it rolls wonderfully between excitement, thrills and emotional drama towards a satisfactory (though a slightly rushed) conclusion. There are at least 2 sequences so powerful that I defy anyone not to at least stifle a tear or choke a little. One of those sequence is an exquisitely executed flashback that is pivotal to the whole story. I have to say, that despite the woes we book readers have when elements (big chunks of it too) are omitted from the movies, much credit still has to go to Steve Kloves for adapting the books for the big screen, cleverly weaving, changing and even adding new big elements to give a kinetic flow to the narrative and here it all comes together superbly.David Yates assured direction has nurtured our young actors in the last 4 films to blossom into even more adept actors who convey their characters with natural tones without overacting. Daniel Radcliffe had to carry this movie more than any other and has done so brilliantly complemented with great support from his two companions, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint.Pretty much all the characters we have met in all the movies have made an appearance in this finale but one actor stands out, Alan Rickman. His portrayal of Professor Snape has always been a joy to watch (if a little novel) but here his scenes will leave a dramatic engraving in my memory. Here he elevates his portrayal of one of the most complex character in young adult literature to an unforgettable piercingly emotional one.Another actor who really shines in the few scenes that he has, is Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom who we see gradually transforming over the past films from the clumsy bullied boy to a brave warrior in this final film. Many other British thespians of the series also have their few moments to shine especially Maggie Smith's Professor McGonagal who was a delight to watch as she takes charge of the defence of Hogwarth School.As for the spectacle of the battle and showdowns, while not at the scale of Lord of the Rings, I honestly cant think how it could have been done better as the film makers have intertwined heart stopping action with dramatic progressions in the narrative. Its actually more visceral and dynamic than the rather smaller scale battle of the brilliant novels (not to take anything away from Rowling's writing). Do I have any gripes? Yes I do. Although I applaud Steve Kloves for a difficult screenplay adaption...I think he could still have done better at explaining some odd anomalies that only readers of the book will understand. This might annoy you if you haven't read the books. But its a small gripe because what we get is delightful.What an amazing achievement to faithfully bring Rowling's epic saga to the big screen with the same cast and largely the same crew, maintaining the brilliant quality right to the end.Oh my god, its only just sinking in, this was the end....but what a great great end."
"Overall, it may be said that the movie was good. The direction, cinematography & the special effects were brilliantly executed. The acting was good too. The children have grown so much.But, this isn't the way The Harry Potter saga was meant to end. A movie which is supposed to mark the End of an Era could have been much better. With the expectations I had, I was a little disappointed. It DID NOT have the depth and the emotional impact WASN'T nearly as good as the book. I was pleased with Part 1 because it stuck very well to the book. That's what I was expecting with this too. But no... they had to spoil it. What's the use of making the movie in two parts if they can't do justice to the book? They should have made it a Trilogy (as all great movies are made, like 'The Godfather Trilogy', 'The LOTR Trilogy', original 'Star Wars Trilogy', The Bourne Trilogy', etc.) or they should have increased the length of the 2 parts. Who forced them to fit the whole thing within 2hrs.15mins. each. ??(Every part of LOTR is over 3&1/2 hrs. long. No one had an issue with it). . *** SPOILERS **THE GOOD :Snape's and Voldemort's characters were played quite well.Throughout the series, Snape has been rather emotionless and monotonous. But, in the pensieve, we see a refreshingly new emotional side of him.Gringott's scene was nicely shown.They added the scene where Hermione & Ron destroy Hufflepuff's cup.They show the future (19 years later) scene. I thought it would be cut.THE BAD : (I have to mention these because I was disappointed as hell)My Biggest Disappointment - Snape's Memories. They showed the whole thing within a minute. They're some of the most interesting & touching scenes of the story. They just rushed through it, even excluding many of the memories. Fred's death. They don't even show it. Then later it was ridiculous to see Mrs. Weasley angry at Bellatrix when the latter was fighting Ginny.The battle was too short and didn't the magnitude and impact as in the book, with Centaurs, Goblins/Kreecher, Hagrid/Spiders, Ghosts, etc.They don't show the Common Rooms. I always imagined it while reading the books. But I badly wanted to see them in the movie.They don't show Harry using the Cruciatus Curse on the one of the Carrows.They wasted time in Nagini's chase.They don't mention about Teddy Lupin and that Harry was his Godfather. They don't mention the names of Harry's other two kids.No mention about the significance of the horcruxes.No mention of Bloody Baron and his link with Ravenclaw's diadem.No mention about how the Invisibility Cloak came into the possession of the Potters, how Harry and Voldemort are related through the Peverell brothers.They don't show how Dumbledore communicated with Snape after he died.Harry doesn't even mend is wand. He directly snaps the Elder Wand into two pieces...In the future scene, all the funny and cheerful dialogues are excluded. Everyone's just smiling and staring at each other. And moreover, none of the them seemed in their late thirties. Didn't the film-makers have enough money to hire good make-up artists.THE UGLY :Dumbledore's Story. He's my most favourite character in the book. There's nothing about him in the movie. They just say he had secrets (what secrets??). They don't even tell the story of Dumbledore sister, Ariana. They don't show him getting emotional at King's Cross.The use of ridiculous one-liners and humourless jokes when the situation is so intense and sad.Harry & Voldemort had their final fight in the middle of nowhere. No one was even around to watch it. (In the book, they were in the middle of the whole crowd.)Bellatrix and Voldemort die bursting into confetti!ALL IN ALL, it wasn't the send-off the series deserved. Someone who has grown up reading the books and watching the movies in the series will understand my woes..."
"This movie could not do any better, it ended the Harry Potter series with a bang. It is a good balance from the first part of The Deathly Hallows. The first part was more of a drama, while part two was action packed left and right. This may be my favorite movie of the series, though all of them are equally amazing. I have read the books, and there are definitely major changes in the movie, but I find they fit perfectly well with the story, even if it isn't the original plot. Even for those who haven't read the books (why wouldn't you?!), it is equally enjoyable. This movie, along with the rest in the series, will be loved for years and years to come."
"I don't know what I was expecting... To be honest apart from the first HP movie... every single one of the following movies has left out major plot points, characters and story lines. I guess I figured that was mainly because the movies only have a certain length of time to tell the story. Thus it was natural for me to assume that with 5+ hours they would be able to include everything in the one book... I assumed wrongly.First off - Do not see this in 3D... The 3D is an after thought and literally added nothing to the experience. The only scene that was 3D that stands out in memory was the death of Voldemort and his confetti explosion.What did they get right? Well its hard to say really.. I was really disappointed with the pacing for the first half of the 2nd part. It felt slow and weird and anti-climatic the entire way. The bank scene and special effects seems average and low budget for a franchise with such high profits. The acting from everyone doesn't quite do the job. Snapes ""redemption"" scene was acted out really poorly by Alan Rickman.. which is a shame because I was really looking forward to it as it's one of the more moving parts in the series. The only scene that felt like it mirrored the book accurately was the Kings Cross section (apart from Harry having clothes on...) My main gripe with the movie is that they left out so much considering they had two movies to cover it. Harry telling Neville to kill the snake and thus Neville having and important role in the ending of the war <- This part was the ONE part I was looking forward to when Neville pulls the sword out of the hat and cuts Nagini in two... Yet they changed it to Hermione and Ron battling the snake and Neville coming in as an afterthought... The entire war at the end was missing - Centaurs, Goblins/Kreecher, Hagrid/Aragog and just felt very anti-climatic and also have very poor CGI. The entire point of the Deathly Hallows is missed out with Harry not claiming ownership of the wand and reflecting Voldemorts death spell back onto him, and is replaced with a VERY tame action scene that went for about 10 minutes (its then mentioned as an afterthought by Harry post battle). The scene when Harry confronts Snape was also bizarre and seemed unnecessary... Overall the changes and missing scenes left me feeling very empty.My girlfriend hasn't read the books and she enjoyed it.. So I'm sitting here wondering if the knowledge of the books hampered my enjoyment of it. I have no doubt this film will be hailed a success and will make bazillon dollars, but I can't help but feel that another director/team could've handled this a lot truer to the books."
Even though I consider myself to be a huge HP fan I never thought I would actually give a movie from this series straight 10 out of 10. Just saw the movie today and the word epic is almost an understatement. This movie really lives up to the promises that have been made. Further more it is (in my opinion at least) the movie that stays most loyal to the book. I did miss some scenes from the book yet nothing relevant was left out. I don't want to give out any spoilers 'cause I don't want to ruin it for you but if you have read the book it will be very easy to follow and if not - well I think it still makes sense most of the time. I highly recommend you to watch it whether you're a fan or not. 10/10
"I watched Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 and was very pleased with how well it stuck to the book. Because of this, I had high expectations for Part 2. I mean, if you did so well in the first half, you have to do just as well in the second half, right? Right? Wrong.The movie started off very well, starting from exactly where it left off in Part 1 and staying faithful to the book all the way to when Harry and co break into Hogwarts. That's where it starts to go down hill.*Spoilers!* The good: Neville. He was perfectly perfect. I really wish they gave him more screen time because he was adorable.The Gringott's scene. Very well done.The emotion we are shown from Snape. Throughout the series, he's been rather monotonous and emotionless. In the pensieve, we see a different side of him and it is a refreshing change.The battle at Hogwarts. It was intense and wonderfully done.Helena Ravenclaw. It was very emotional and creepy. Although they did not tell us her back story with the Bloody Baron.Rupert Grint and Dan Radcliffe shirtless. That's certainly a plus.OK you know it's bad when I resort to writing about that.The bad: They completely took out the scene where Harry and Luna go into the Ravenclaw Common Room, where they are ambushed by one of the Carrows. It appeared as if they would show it, as I hope they would (I've always wanted to see the other common rooms), but then they don't. Hm.Fred's death scene. Gone. Yup. They show his body once at the end and don't even give you time to grieve before moving on to the next scene. This was an insult to his character's memory.Crabbe's disappeared. Gets replaced by Zabini, and replaced in a different way by Goyle.Snape's memories are rushed and they take out some of the most interesting memories. They just go through a few of them quickly. I've always enjoyed the memories, because you get to see life at Hogwarts through the eyes of someone else for a change, in a different time era.Hermione and Ron battle Nagini, and eventually Neville slays the snake. Eventually. It takes some time getting to that scene.There is not a single mention of Teddy Lupin. That is, until the end when Harry suddenly knows about Lupin's son. Weird, considering Harry was camping in a forest and hadn't heard of any of this.Collin Creevey is replaced by that random Nigel kid.The students are not sent home. No, the teachers think it's OK to just lock the Slytherins in the dungeons and let everybody else stay and fight.Still no mention of the significance of the horcruxes. Hufflepuff's cup is just a plain old cup that Voldy turned into a horcrux.Not enough interaction with characters other than the trio. Too much Harry. It's as if everybody else just have cameos.Random scene where they blow up one of the bridges (ignoring the fact that there are like 2 other bridges that would take them into the school).Voldemort's and Bellatrix's death = explosion into confetti!Percy's on the good side all of a sudden. No explanation at all (a reoccurring theme with Yates, don't you think?).Harry does not fix his old wand with the Elder Wand. No, instead he takes the Elder Wand and SNAPS IT IN HALF. Is that even possible? I didn't think so. So Harry breaks the wand and then chucks it into the abyss. Really Yates, really?All of the fun and cheerful dialogue from the future scene has been resorted to everybody staring and smiling at each other. No explanation once again. They don't even say who's who! Plus there is absolutely no chemistry between Dan and Albus Severus. And it was really awkward to see them all with old make up on.Goodbye Dumbledore's back story! Too many attempts at one-liners and humorless jokes.*End of Spoilers* All in all, all of the personality and charm of the series was zapped away in an attempts to make this final movie is action-packed as possible. It's a shame to see something that you've grown up with, learned to love, taken and twisted into somebody's 'vision.' I mean, why bother adding your own unimportant scenes to the movie, when there are perfectly good ones in the book that you did not bother using at all? There's no...bonding with the characters, no connection with them you felt in Part 1. I did not feel the love for this movie like I had with the book. There was just so much significance that was left out of that movie, and it is such a shame. It had such potential to be a fantastic movie, and it fell short all because of the changes that were unnecessarily made.See the movie, and I'm sure you'll form your own opinion of it. It's not a bad movie, just disappointing and unsatisfying for a die-hard fan who's been following the books for 10 years of their life."
"Endings are usually the problems of most movie series. They usually end up being mediocre & unsatisfying or they are made to cash in people. The great thing about Harry Potter movies, the filmmakers are taking their job seriously. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a great ending of the series. It's more than throwing a lot of action and exposition. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is one of those conclusion that actually care about the series.Deathly Hallows part 1 is just the first and the half of the second act of the story. Deathly Hallows part 2 begins straight forward to its continuation of the last Harry Potter film. And of course, if you haven't seen Deathly Hallows Part 1 or any of the Harry Potter movies, you'll be confused to death. Obvious isn't it? It's pretty clever to make the whole Deathly Hallows story like a slow burn. It started from silent thrills, plans, and escapes to big and loud battles.The series doesn't only end with big and loud action. It also gives us some nostalgia from the old Harry Potter films. And we still get to see more of the characters. The movie itself is pretty exciting. It's a good choice to let David Yates direct the rest of the Potter films because he made this series darker and bolder. Aside from that the film still has its compelling moments like the Prince's Tale scene.No need to tell about the performances of Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and the rest of the cast because they are obviously good to their characters but there is one actor here is worth mention and that is Alan Rickman. We already knew him as Snape but there is one scene where we see more of his character and his performance was excellent. The filmmaking, the special effects is obviously good. The music score really made the battle scenes epic and perfect for a final film.For me it's really hard to write a review about Harry Potter. Is it because I never read the books or I'm not really a huge fan but in my opinion Harry Potter is a successful series. If I rank all the movie conclusions, this could be number three because nothing beats Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. Either you're a fan or not, you'll love this series. And yes, this is another remarkable movie series."
"OVerall it was okay, and will make a bunch of money. But David Yates was not the best to direct the Potter films. His method always seems to be to just get through the movie as quick as possible. This has been true since OOTP. The problem is that such a quick pace leaves out many key scenes and doesn't allow the viewer to make more of an emotional investment in the story and the characters. Deathly Hallows 2 was no different. It was enjoyable enough, I suppose. But could have been so much better with just an additional 10 minutes of movie. A few additional scenes and extending a few of them just a little more could have added greater depth and emotion.Spoiler alert: Just some scenes that could have been added or extended: Snapes memories- a few more scenes to greater establish his closeness with Lilly and his role in fighting Voldemort. It would have helped to explain why Harry named one of his kids after a man he had hated for 7 years. And a few more lines to show his reluctance to have to be the one to kill Dumbledore. This would have shown Snapes greater respect and love for him.Slightly extend the scene leading up to Mrs. Weasley fighting Belatrix. A few more seconds to establish Jinny's peril in the fight before Mrs. Weasly stepping in and uttering her great line. IT happened so fast, you could miss that Jinny was even fighting Belatrix if you blink at the wrong time.SHould have shown the death of Fred and Percy's reuniting with the family. This wouldn't have taken very long and Fred deserved to have his death scene, rather than just being an afterthought body on a stretcher.SHould have shown a few more individual fight sequences, especially with Hagrid. I was beginning to wonder if Hagrid was even going to appear. And there was no emotion from him when he thought Harry was dead.Extend the scene of Mrs. Malfoy and Harry to better explain why she lied to Voldemort about Harry being dead.Should have shown more entities involved in the fight, like parents, Hogsmead residence, the elves as lead by Kreacher - rather than showing mainly an army of kids fighting the Death Eaters.MOre of the school's teachers in the fight.The final confrontation between Harry and Voldemort could have been done better and stayed truer to the book.OVer all, Yates' Harry Potter movies have been rather emotionless and anti-climatic. DH2, sadly, was no different."
"I predict this will be the movie of the year.I was thoroughly immersed in this movie from start to finish and when leaving the cinema (twice in the last 24hours) I could only hear the endless chatter of comments like ""That was great"" and ""Brilliant way to end the series"".Though, in my opinion, some key factors were missing or needed more exploration I think you'll find it's easy to clue on whether you've read the novels or not. Some previously main characters were lucky to slip in a line or two whilst some of the more minor characters sneaked their way up to the top.The film was brilliantly directed. Music, lighting, script; everything was flawless. Some scenes had my skin crawling and heart racing for absolutely no reason other then the fact that it was utterly eerie, it was hard not to grip the armrests in anticipation.Dramatic musical build up mixed perfectly with lingering silences in all the right places. Spots that would usually host a soft violin were left with the honest and real quiet so that you could wrap your head around everything.My emotions were chewed up and spit out over and over, I didn't know whether to grieve, cheer, laugh or scream and neither did the audience I was with.By the end I couldn't even think of the fact that it was the end of an era, I couldn't even grasp everything that had happened which is why I'll be going to see it for the third time within this next week.You wont regret paying for the full experience with this one."
"Harry Potter's saga had many directors; I will not go back again to who was the best (hint; a Mexican guy), but by far Mr. Yates was the worst. Mr. Yates was only interested in make an easy sell PRODUCT. The only reason the first was paced was to fill out two movies with only one book. Now, we are at the end so WHO CARES, let's just finish it, get the money and keep going. Clocking barely two hours, it feel rush and incomplete; missing lots of interesting (and even important) parts on one of the richer book of the series. Hermione and Ron do almost nothing; the others even less. Harry gets a lot of screen time but not necessary good scenes. Even the battle at Hogwarts (the only part Mr. Yates seems to be interested ) is a lame copy of ""The Two Towers"" without any kind of emotion. His direction so bad and unimaginative that when most of the characters die; we do not feel anything. In brief; worth seeing to understand how better the book is and because it is the last one; but AVOID any further movies with David Yates as director."

"SERIOUS SPOILERS INCLUDED ***************************** David Heyman, the Producer of the Harry Potter films, made the single biggest mistake of his career when he decided that the Director of each film would be offered the opportunity to direct the next. Chris Columbus did a great job working with the young inexperienced actors and actresses in the first 2 films. Alfonso Cuarón and Mike Newell did good jobs with the next 2 (I wish Goblet of Fire had been split into 2 films to include many more subplots, but the primary emotional content was maintained). For various reason, each of these three directors stopped.Then David Yates entered the scene and proceeded to dramatically change the feel of the films. For lack of a better word, the ""magic"" was expunged and everything took on a more ""realistic"" look. Films 5 and 6 were terrible compared with the books. I initially blamed 5 on the fact that Steve Kloves did not write the screenplay, but I now know I was wrong.The film of Deathly Hallows, Part I was OK, but it was simply the setup for the emotional second half.I just saw Deathly Hallows, Part II this evening and I was speechless. In addition to adding useless parts to the narrative, critical emotional scenes were eliminated (e.g. final conversation with Dumbledore and the final conversation between Harry and Voldemort/Tom Riddle where Harry gave Voldemort on last chance to find remorse).Yates even managed to suck the life out of one of the most exciting moments in the book, where Molly Weasley intervenes to save Ginny from Bellatrix and yells ""Not my daughter, you bitch!"" In the film, Molly calmly makes this statement as if she is some western gunfighter.The final scene between the 3 main characters (not including the epilogue) had NO life at all.David Yates - shame on you.Thank goodness we will always have the books."
"Moments after I saw the very first trailer for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, I was crawling with goosebumps and plagued with anxiety. After almost a decade, the franchise was coming to an end. I had already read the book, knew the plotting, and remembered the fates of all the characters, but the trailer left me in a near unfathomable state -- the end was coming, and there was nothing I could do to stop it.Picking up practically the exact moment where the first half of the left off, the film begins with Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) still on the trail for the elusive Horcruxes that make up Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) soul. Rather quickly, it becomes apparent that the group will need to travel back to Hogwarts, and it is there that the final battle to determine the fate of the wizarding community, and the world at large, begins.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a fitting finale for one of the best and most consistent series of the past decade. It is a simply wondrous spectacle that extends and concludes the story wonderfully. While the story and effects are just as great as always, it is the final battle we have all been waiting for that delivers in spades. It is everything you imagined it would be and more. Splitting the films may still be a debatable decision, but the film is able to stand on its own much the same way the previous part did. It is that good, and that gripping. It may be the shortest Harry Potter film, but it is also the only one that feels like it knows exactly where it wants to navigate itself to with each new scene. Grint, Watson and especially Radcliffe are simply stunning in their performances. They have grown up with these characters, and have gotten progressively stronger as actors with each new film. But here, they have totally immersed themselves into their roles, and the results are nothing short of magical. They are exactly how you remember them written in the book, and move from sadness, to courageous, to fearful, and more, with such passion and conviction that you forget they are simply acting. Their styles are that strong, and help provide the emotional crux the film leans on and never from. Even with their varying screen times, the supporting cast is impeccable as always. Alan Rickman is spectacular and simply devastating as the devious Professor Snape. Maggie Smith finally gets some real time to shine as Professor McGonagall, as does Julie Walters as Molly Weasley (who gets the greatest line in the film). Jason Isaacs, Helena Bonham Carter, George Harris, Tom Felton, Michael Gambon and Matthew Lewis also perfect their characters, and help deliver awesome performances all around.But the supporting screen time is dominated by Fiennes as Voldemort. When Harry and his friends are not the focal point, Fiennes simply owns everyone. His performance always ranked amongst the best of the series, and he does not let the finale slow him down. He is horrifically evil in his interpretation, and frequently compares to his absolutely and terrifyingly brilliant performance as Amon Goeth in Schindler's List. The fear that courses through the characters' veins at the very sight or mention of his name, courses equally through the audience. Even when he is being darkly hilarious, Fiennes is downright petrifying. He is the stuff that nightmares are made of. His work is just that close to perfect in the role that it gives an almost genuine authenticity that should not come so effortlessly.But like all Harry Potter films however, the cohesive product is not without its faults.My main gripe with the film come out of the sheer fact that because it was split off into two parts, it allowed some of the more useless and careless sections of prose to make it into the film. Much like the extended and excruciatingly long camping trip from the first half, the second half gets dragged down by the addition of standout moments from the book that felt awful the first time you read them, and come off even worse on the screen. I know they are pandering to the audience, and adding just as much as they possibly could to make the film feel complete, but there was a reason so much was cut out of the other books when they made the leap to the big screen. This is the shortest of the saga by a long shot, and the chaotic pace makes it feel like it could have been even shorter had they chopped more out.My other gripe is the 3D. The filmmakers said they did not have the right amount of time to convert the first half properly, so they just scrapped the plans. The movie looked amazing anyway, and I found myself puzzled at what exactly would have been three-dimensional about it about the second part. Save for a scene early on involving a rather badly rendered dragon, there is not much else that takes advantage of the added 3D. The majority of the film just looks and acts normal, never exploring the format, and never giving the audience a reason to care or change their minds on the quickly dying trend. In what feels like a blink of the eye, the Harry Potter film series is over. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 has arrived, and with it, an incredible end to the franchise. It stumbles in some places because of the inane and disappointing prose of the book, but the filmmakers have stayed true to their book and film fans, and delivered a tremendously worthy finale. It is one of the strongest films of the year, and one of the best film finales ever conceived. 8.5/10.(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com)."
"Yeah. I came out of the film disappointed. Not feeling like I had a good time.Don't get me wrong, it was a good movie. But there are things that brought it down and too many of them for it to be forgivable.1) Dumbledore's brother and sister. You know what I mean. Referred to and never followed upon.2) The kiss. Didn't happen in the Chamber of Secrets. In fact, did the Chamber scene happen at all? In the book, it happens after Ron expresses concern for the welfare of the elves (in light of Dobby's heroic death) in the outbreak of a fire at Hogwarts. Here, it is given to you as a variation of the ""We're alive! Let's kiss!"" movie cliché'.3) Fred's death should have been on screen. Period.4) The Avada Kedavra curse didn't make bodies disintergrate. Until Voldemort (and perhaps Bellatrix, too?). What? 5) The roles of Matthew Lewis and Evanna Lynch (Neville and Luna respectively) were enough to warrant their names as part of the supporting cast. To only see their names in the full cast is scandalous to say the least.(And, yes, I am aware two-time Oscar winner Emma Thompson gets the same treatment. I know she makes two small appearances, but again, she has two bloody Oscars! Either she is very humble or she needs a better agent.) 6) They really should have stuck with the CGI aging. Except for maybe Ginny and Draco, none of them looked like they were 36."
"An incredible journey that began a decade ago finally arrives at its close with David Yates' ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II"", as 'The Boy Who Lived' comes face to face with 'He Who Shall Not Be Named' in an epic showdown between good and evil. And what a showdown it is- tense, thrilling, breathtaking, and fitting of just about any superlative you can think of. Whereas the first instalment of the 'Deathly Hallows' emphasised the profound sense of loss and isolation among Harry, Ron and Hermoine, screenwriter Steve Kloves and director Yates leaves behind the moody atmosphere of the previous movie for newfound immediacy and urgency. This is all about that final battle where only one can live, and from start to finish- for once in a Harry Potter movie- the action is swift and relentless.Part II picks up right where the previous film left off- the dark Lord Voldemort smiles in evil triumph as he steals the most powerful wand in the world, i.e. the Elder Wand, from the tomb of beloved Hogwarts headmaster Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon). The next shot is equally ominous- students are marched rank-and-file through a Hogwarts courtyard, watched closely by cloaked Dementors hovering over the school grounds. If there was any need of a reminder of the danger facing our three protagonists, these opening sequences should just about refresh one's memory of what is at stake.There is precious little time to waste, and the first we get to see Harry, Ron and Hermione, they are already hatching a plan to break into Gringotts to retrieve a Horcrux. Their break-in settles upon a plan of deception that allows for some rare moments of levity in the film, as Helena Bonham Carter gets to ham it up as a polyjuice-disguised Hermoine impersonating Bellatrix Lestrange. This being the first 'Harry Potter' movie in 3D, Yates caters for some distinctive thrills in the additional dimension with a roller-coaster ride through the vault, culminating in a daring escape on the back of a dragon.But as readers of the book will tell you, the last stand happens back at Hogwarts, and true enough, after this thrilling early set-piece at Gringotts, the trio head back to the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to confront their foes. It is also where the last Horcruxes are supposed to be, and Harry's return to the once sunny and cheery grounds now besieged by darkness and doom becomes a true test of allegiance. Fans will be glad that Kloves gives room for otherwise supporting characters to step into the limelight- in particular, Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis) emerges as one of the unlikeliest but also truest heroes on the side of good. The Hogwarts stalwarts also get a chance to show off their magic, and Yates gives each largely enough screen time for the heroic send-off they deserve.Yet he reserves the most emotional moment in the film for Severus Snape's (Alan Rickman) vindication, long thought to be the Judas Iscariot-equivalent in the Order and the one who pushed Dumbledore to his death. Yates delivers a truly poignant and deeply heartfelt revelation of Snape's true colours, and it is a farewell that even those who have read the book and can expect what is to come will be overwhelmed by its sheer emotional muscle. While Part II was always meant to be an action-packed spectacle, it is to Yates' credit that there is still as much heart as before in the storytelling.Though brief, this revelation also works brilliantly as a catalyst that propels Harry to come to terms with the sacrifice he has to make. Harry's realization of this leads up perfectly to the ultimate duel between him and Voldemort, one that is fierce, ferocious and- thanks to Yates' imagination- more exhilarating than reading it off the page. The outcome of that battle shouldn't be a secret by now, and when the 'happily-ever-after' coda in Rowling's book set 19 years later is also faithfully adapted here, you can't quite help but be moved by how it so properly gives the series closure.They are of course no longer kids here- Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson now young adults who have through the film series grown up right under our eyes. While Part I had greater emphasis on Ron and Hermoine, the focus here is squarely on Harry and Radcliffe truly shines in this instalment- his usual understated performance allowing his audience to appreciate the enormities of the challenge before Harry.That we can be so fully immersed in Harry's world is testament to the craft of each and every one of the technical team. Production designer Stuart Craig does a masterful job portraying the devastation around Hogwarts, complimented nicely by Eduardo Serra's beautiful cinematography and Mark Day's skillful editing. Alexandre Desplat's evocative score, which combines his own elegiac work with both the John Williams theme as well as Nicholas Hooper's mournful composition for the sixth movie, works magic with the visuals. And most deserving of credit is none other than director Yates himself, who has matured movie after movie to deliver a crowning achievement for the series.Pardon us if we have also taken this opportunity to extol the merits of the 'Harry Potter' franchise- it's really hard not to considering how this is the last time we will see the Potter-world in its current incarnation. It is this to which the movie is a farewell to, and it is as beautiful a farewell as it can be, packed with visual spectacle on a scale never before seen in any of the other films and fused with the same powerful emotion as Part I and the Yates films before. All good- even great- things have to come to an end, so there is really no better way to bid adieu than with this grand and glorious final chapter."
"Yes this film has amazing special effects, and the Hogwarts fight really keeps you on edge for the entire film. The fight between Voldemort and Harry was really well done, even though it deviates from the book, but being a film it has to.Where this film loses point is where it omits far too much from the book. This goes for the Half-blood prince too. In fact, I think all of Yates' films follow this pattern:I know they have to make some tough choices by cutting out what is not really essential. Though an extra 10 minutes would not have hurt. Dumbledore's past is only slightly hinted at in both films, but never explored. Leaves you wondering why they even bothered to mention it in either film. One thing I was really looking forward to was the fight between Dumbledore and Grindewald in a flashback of some sort. Aberforth neglected to mention anything though. I was also looking forward to the three-way duel between Voldemort, McGonnagal and someone else (I can't remember who), but that was also omitted. The Deathly Hallows aren't really explained, we never know that Harry's cloak is one of them, or that Dumbledore possessed all 3 at one stage. Makes the film's name seem a little pointless. Horcruxs are also rushed. No explanation for their significance. Also, why Harry is able to go back to life, the significance of Voldemort using Harry's blood back in film 4, is all left out. Most disappointing of all, is the ending. When Frodo destroys the ring, the movie doesn't just end. But when Voldemort dies, the movie ends a minute or two later. Lets not forget the 100s of death eaters that are still alive....what happened to them? There's no happy endings, rejoicing, no thankyous, nothing. This is another point where I think Yates gets it wrong. There really is no interaction between Harry, Ron and Hermione. In fact, Harry doesn't have much dialog either. He doesn't even look at his Dad in the forest. This really make the film feel rushed. As I said, once Voldemort dies there really is nothing else. You kind of expect some sort of happy ending with Hagrid, the Weasleys, the Gryffindor kids. But look, the film was still pretty good. I give it a 7 out of 10 and there's a load of review that will tell you why. Go read those. Also, the giants looked stupid."
"We've been to the first session (virtually) of each Harry Potter movie. You expect the movie to never be exactly like a book (when is it EVER?!) but this one really did change a few things that shouldn't have been touched.There was a lot of good work in this movie. Lily, James, Sirius and Remus joining Harry to go into the Forbidden Forest was well kept. The acting was impressive as usual, something one has come to expect from this group. The visual effects were also excellent, and the storyline was well followed up to a point (this is why the movie got 7/10 from the writer); however, when major changes to this occurred, disappointment set in.The lack of use of the Invisibility Cloak (which we all know is one of the most important hallows to possess) by Harry throughout the movie (except for when they are at Gringotts) is puzzling, as he used it extensively to get around Hogwarts so he could manage to obtain the diadem horcrux as well as make his way to Voldemort within the Forbidden Forest. Also, when Harry 'falls' out of Hagrid's arms out in Hogwart's grounds (when all Hell breaks loose due to Nagini's demise) he uses the Cloak to escape and cause panic amongst the Death Eaters.Also, the fact Harry didn't tell Neville it was imperative Nagini needed to be killed, but Hermione instead, diminishes Neville's importance! In the book, it is completely up to Neville to destroy Nagini as he is the only one left who it is thought to be able to. Also, it can be tied into the prophecy that Trelawney made all those years before as Neville killing the final horcrux, causes Voldemorts vulnerability. Thankfully, Neville is the one that kills Nagini, but more by luck than good management.Harry telling Dumbledore that he had nothing to kill Voldemort with (at Kings Cross Station) was not correct, as well, as he went into the Forest with both the Cloak and a wand, which was what made him so special as he did not raise that wand against Voldemort. He instead died willingly, again showing his great strength and love of those important to him - his friends/family at Hogwarts.The adaptation by the screen writer, Steve Kloves, of the final scene between Voldemort and Harry of the novel - well...THAT'S A DISAPPOINTMENT!!! What J.K Rowling wrote was good enough and whenever I've read it I've always loved it and pictured it so clearly in my mind, so the whole battle scene between Harry and Voldemort was ridiculous, and could only occur because they ruined the sequence of events. VERY UNNECESSARY! The wands locking in battle – what the???? That should not have occurred, as they had different cores, different timbers and were nothing like the Twin Core Phenomenon that occurred in book four (Goblet of Fire). You don't even hear Harry say Expelliarmus which had become his 'trademark spell'.Harry, Ron and Hermione not going to the Headmaster's Office after defeating Voldemort, and there getting a standing ovation from all previous Headmasters and Headmistresses, and Harry not mending his phoenix feather core wand through using the Elder Wand (Death Stick) was very much an anticlimax. Instead, Harry (in the company of Ron and Hermione) snaps the Elder Wand (the possibility of which I would think is questionable in the first place!) and chucks it off the bridge (never to be seen again?).It would have been nice to have had the connection between the Dumbledore's and Grindelwald explained, especially Adriana's death. This actually moulded Dumbledore into the man he became - a professor and later Headmaster of Hogwarts; never Minister of Magic; and a supporter of Muggle-born witches and wizards. It also explained how he came into possession of the Elder Wand.I was so glad, and there was applause in the theatre when the epilogue occurred as its lovely to see Albus Severus Potter and the short conversation between him and his father, Harry.Overall, probably not one I will see again at the movies, which is something I have done with the others (though they were disappointments in ways as well!)."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, part 2 also known as the movie that tore my heart and soul into oblivion. If you thought goosebumps was the criteria for a good scene, then mix those goosebumps with emotional upheaval, coupled with your hands almost shaking and this is Deathly Hallows part 2 in its entirety.Harry, Ron and Hermione are still on the pursuit to collect and destroy Voldemort's horcruxes. They believe the next one is hidden away in Bellatrix Lestrange's vault in Gringotts, the wizarding bank. But going into the bank is near impossible – unless you know a goblin who worked there, which they do. And so a deal is stricken. At Gringotts, they are discovered to be impostors. Hearts will race as they try to escape with the horcrux and as Harry soon finds out the next one is hidden inside Hogwarts and it's something that belongs to another founder of the school. And it is to Hogwarts that he goes. But Hogwarts has changed. Snape is the new headmaster.But there are many things that Harry doesn't know, the ultimate secret being one that revolves around his every being. Things are never as it seems. People will show their true colors and they will come out as triumphant even after years of hatred.Dan Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have done the impossible here. They are possibly the only set of actors that you have seen grow up on the big screen and as the actors grew up on a personal level, they added their maturity to their characters. It's very fascinating to watch them interact. Their acting is relentless, captivating and charming as it should be now that they have mastered the characters they're playing. You cannot imagine other actors portraying Harry and Ron or another actress to portray Hermione. Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith as Snape and Professor McGonagall respectively gave their all in this movie. You cannot help but be on the edge of your seat whenever any of these two actors are doing their thing. Rickman has a part of the movie entirely dedicated to his character's personal story. It is also one of my favorite parts of the book. The Prince's Tale is transferred so magnificently on screen that it WILL bring you to tears.Professor McGonagall takes a stand – several, actually – in Deathly Hallows as well. She stands up for a Harry and when she does, the whole theater will explode in applause. Maggie Smith fortifying Hogwarts and then cracking a joke to lighten up the mood Just the way I like it. You cannot but share the pain in Smith's eyes as she sees her beloved school crumbling around her, as she sees all the work that they've done go to waste And what better actor to portray this generation's most bad-ass villain than Ralph Fiennes. He gives his character an extra dimension in this movie now that he has the room to spread his wings so to speak, seeing as he's one of the movie's main pillars. Lord Voldemort is all evil. But in this movie, another side of him shows up: anguish and misery. And yet, there's this subtlety to the nuances of the portrayal that make up the overall result to be very epic, indeed.Steve Kloves is the movie's screenwriter. He captured the movie's essence perfectly. He presented J.K. Rowling's work in such a brilliant way that even the slight deviations from the book (and they are very few) do not even matter anymore. He portrays the gravity of the situation to the letter: the deaths, the destruction, the revelations, the build-up. His version of the story is so well done that it would be incredible not to see an Oscar nod (and a win!) for him in the Screenplay category. He added his touch while keeping Rowling's magic. Some of the lines from the book are transferred to the movie as they are and for someone who has read the book over and over again, I was ecstatic to hear them on screen. ""Look atme."" Enough said.Director David Yates has helmed the last four Potter movies and while I had my doubts about him at first (Order of the Phoenix was not exactly great), he more than surpassed my wildest expectations in this. The pace he sets for the movie never dies down. It keeps on building up and up like a beautiful orchestral crescendo. He guides his actors and actresses with confidence. He's working with a marvelous script based on a terrific book. And he has the green light to give it all out. What do you expect from a very talented director with those options? Something not less than magical.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 provides you with a sense of catharsis as it ends. It lets your senses go. It lowers your inhibitions more than alcohol. You cannot help but see your hands automatically clap at some points in the movie. You shout in desperation without even controlling your voice and you root for your characters like they're really in front of you. Tears flow down your face without any power of you to stop them. There isn't any better way to end the epic series that was Harry Potter. If only it weren't ending"
"If I was to think of this and part 1 as one long movie, it'd be a 7/10. However it's not and part 2 was a shadow of the first. A real 'hollow' film that seemed rushed and had no great emotion or character depth which, to me, is what the final film should consist of the most. The bad. 1. Goblins getting stoned from spells. 2. No real dialogue between any of the characters 3. Harry snaps the most powerful wand ever, with his bare hands after Olivander makes wands seem like living things earlier in the film. But yeah. He just snaps it. Poor storytelling. 4. The only good thing in the film (Snape's memory) was rushed. 5. Bad humour to break the tension when the tension should not have been broken. It is meant to be a dark film after all. 6. Not showing characters deaths. Which one of the Weasley's died? I challenge anyone that hasn't read the book to answer that. They showed no close up and didn't really give any notification as to who it was, except for maybe once. Which doesn't really give the characters justice and makes them seem worthless. 7. The Death Eaters just leave and I'm left asking..why? Why is this not explained? 8. The Elder Wand should not duel against it's master Harry, I thought? So why did it do so once the part of Voldemort was out of Harry and just before Nagini was killed? It's as if it went, oh, Nagini is now dead. Voldemort can die. Let's deflect the spell onto him now. So stupid. Substituting suspense with a consistent plot. 9. You'd expect some interesting words from Harry and Voldemort, especially since their feud has been hyped up for 10 years. There was none of that. 10. No screen time for anybody except Harry and Voldemort. The Good. 1. Voldemort walking through blood in his bare feet talking to Nagini in parsel tongue. It was dark and brilliant. If there rest of the film had continued like that, it would of been a lot better. 2. Snape's memory. It contained emotion and served justice to the character. Which no other character truly got in this film.There's loads more bad things about this film. But it's annoying me just thinking about them. There is not other good things I can think of. I feel robbed as a fan of previous films and a fan of the books. 1."
"I quite luckily got the chance to see this at an early screening on July 7th.First impressions of the film? Brilliant.Director David Yates, who also directed the 5th, 6th and 7th films is back to direct the final. This pleases me because these 3 films are my personal favourites out of the 7 that have come out so far so I think it's fair to say that I was expecting big things from this. I'm very pleased to say that he's pulled it off ending the series in a fast paced, well written final act.The film (in case you're wondering) picks up straight after where Part 1 ended, Voldemort (Ralph Finnes) has the most powerful wand in his possession and he's finally ready to succeed in what he tried to do over 15 years ago. He finally has the power to kill Harry Potter. I won't go into much more detail in what happens as most people will have read the book and I don't want to drop spoilers! Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) need to seek out and destroy Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes. This is the only way that will give them a chance of stopping He Who Must Not Be Named.Their final journey takes them to places we may not have seen recently or remembered, places such as Gringotts Bank in Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade. Along the way they encounter a variety of creatures, both friend and foe from dragons to spiders, death eaters to old friends and of course, the Dark Lord himself. Will Voldemort Succeed? Or will good trump evil? For those who haven't read the book this is your chance to find out.What I especially love about this film and Part 1 is the direction in which they've taken, adding more cheesy lines and (for example in Part 1) that dance sequence. I feel that these small touches bring the films closer to our hearts and help us to connect with the film a lot more. Sure they leave out a lot of information that the books provide but that's the same with all film adaptations! They've got the main story down and where they've deviated from the book it has been for the best. Not everything written down on paper will translate into visually appealing footage.Part 1 to me also felt unfinished (well it was only half the book I suppose!), I mean in the way that it was long and never seemed to climax. Sure at the end of Part 1 Voldemort gets the want he so badly seeks for and leaves then the films ends on a giant cliffhanger. Part 2 definitely adds the rest of that epicness that so many other films have towards the end. It's full of action! I definitely believe that both Part 1 and 2 are best viewed with a short as possible gap in between them. Otherwise it's like watching the first disc from one of the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings and not watching the second disc for another 6 months!This paragraph is about the visuals and 3D. Skip to the final paragraph for final thoughts.Visually the film is stunning from an effects point of view. From the trailer alone you can see that this film has quite a lot of action in it, crumbling buildings, hundreds of spells and lots of fire. Everything looks great, from the wand duals to the dragons it all is fantastic. Also this time around it is being showed in 3D and is the first (and (probably) last!) potter film to be shown in this way. Now I was very sceptical about this, especially since they announced that the films (originally both parts) would be converted from 2D to 3D instead of being natively filmed in 3D. I believe that what they should have done was what they did with Part 1, scrap the 3D. I'm going to say that it's not great, at times it's pretty good, but never great. For the most part it's okay. I'm going to compare it with the last blockbuster film to come out in 3D, Transformers: Dark of the Moon. The 3D effect is not even close to looking as good as what that film (shot in 3D) had. So I'm going to tell you now, 2D is the best dimension to watch this film in. Having said that if you still want to (or have to) see it in 3D by all means do, the 3D doesn't take away anything from the film, but it doesn't add much.I will end by saying that I definitely recommend this film for everyone, especially Potter fans. The ending that many thought could easily be done wrongly has been done right. Then when you think of Part 1 and 2 as the same film I believe that they are easily the best Potter films. This truly is a fitting ending for the boy who lived."
"This movie was so low on my expectations, and it did not disappoint. From the last few movies of Harry Potter that have come out, being an avid reader of the books, I've absolutely loathed the way they've been commercialized for the box office, ignoring a lot of the story that made the story so very emotional. Yes, when I say that, I mean FOR the box office. Yates probably knew he had messed up the series and thought he might as well earn a few bucks and make this an utter fiasco instead of using its plot to live up to the potential it had for an Oscar.Spoiler alert: This movie had so many moments where people go out of character I don't even know where to begin, but I'll try. I'm actually finding it really hard to understand how people have missed it. I'll point out a few instances, they're not in sequence of events, they're just what comes to mind spontaneously:During Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort's epic battle, at a time when Voldemort is ARMED WITH A WAND, instead of targeting the killing curse at Harry, he KICKS HIM AROUND ON THE FLOOR. What is this? Alcoholic husband goes on rampage? THIS is HARRY POTTER people. The world of MAGIC. These things DO NOT happen, sorry Yates.As part of the same scene, Harry throws out a one-liner at Voldy and grabs him by the head and jumps off what appears to be some like of a terrace in Hogwarts, pummeling them in to a fall which appears to be about 15 seconds long, and they just shrug off the dirt from the ground and start crawling toward their wands, unharmed.McGonnagall throws out a couple of one-liners that are totally out of character when she asks Filch to escort Slytherin house to the dungeons and another when she casts that Locomotor spell and says she's always wanted to use it.The oh so timid Neville also comes up with a stupidly placed heroic speech when Voldemort brings Harry's body forward and asks people to join him.Don't even get me STARTED at the part when LORD VOLEMORT *HUGS* Draco Malfoy. Since when does the Dark Lord HUG people?On a lighter note, when Harry returns to school, Seamus throws out a one-liner at Ron when Ginny sees Harry.Those were probably the more major ones, but I'm sure everyone would've liked the movie better with a few changes like more scenes from Snape's past and better makeup for Mr. Malfoy, but I'm restricted on words here.End of spoilers.You also probably should know that I've registered on IMDb JUST to rate this movie the pathetic 2 stars it deserves and write this review.To sum it up, Yates, you're the biggest fool on Earth, oh and PLEASE read the books."
"Time for your OWL marks Mr. Yates and Kloves! No- don't bite your fingers; You don't get a Troll nor a Dreadful either- you have just managed yourself a resounding Poor though. Hmmm, better luck next time!- not for you but for HP fans who may want to see someone else re-doing the entire series in future. Death Hallows Pt 2, for some time to come, will remain as the foremost example of a movie that could had been a classic if not for the grand opportunity missed, or rather wasted by the director and the crew. It had every resource at command- a very talented set of actors, latest 3D and computer technologies, and a 10 years old legacy to guide its way to greatness. But quite inexplicably it refused to even say 'accio' to these sources, and instead, after running impressively through half the way to summit, it wandered, stumbled, and then jumped off the path into same abyss where Harry is made to throw the Elder wand at end. The movie starts convincingly from part 1, and holds itself really well until the time the trio of H.R.H enters into Hogwarts. The scene in vault where artifacts start to multiply or the flight of dragon are superlatively done, there is no question to it. But once inside the castle, the fizz suddenly goes off the movie. Yates wanted to rush towards boom boom explosions with such haste that it let the thing implode on itself. And so the second half becomes a rubble of montages and frozen frames crashed in a monumental heap where Harry Potter fans like me are still trying to find some meaningful pieces together. To put it another words, the entire second half of the movie is just arranged together- there is no feeling introduced, no association built with the characters, no bridges created (but blown away certainly). It just compilation of images one after another. Pretty, no doubt, but Mr. Yates, ought to know that in wizarding world people in images also have soul; and the second half had not a shred of soul in it. And therefore, I did not feel any personal sense of loss when Hogwarts shook and crumbled, when Fred, Lupin , Tonks and so many others died, and quidditch ground burned to ashes. Damn you David Yates- I had loved Hogwarts more than my own school, had ROFLed at Fred's quips and jeers, followed wizard quidditch more than Ron, and had made friends with Harry's batchmates. You dehumanized the entire saga, and left me with not even a feeling of mourning at these losses and worse-- neither one of jubilation at Harry's triumph. And this is my principle discontent. In the movie, the climatic fight between Harry and Voldi occurs completely isolated and away from everyone. There is no one to watch watch this epic struggle which was building since last 7 years of the movie chronology. It was absurd and spoiled the movie for me. I had never liked the 7th book much, but still the conversation between Voledomort and Harry at the end was thrilling and enthralling – equally moving was Harry's conversation with Dumbledore's portrait. Yate's machination constructed an altogether different and vastly inferior ending.As a foot-note, this is still a tolerable movie- and certainly not 'OMG-worst-movie-i-ever-saw' kind of stuff. Pity is that, it could had been much much much better."
"I just saw the movie and i have to admit.. the special effects and whatnot are good.... BUT I'm 100% sure that David Yates never read the books, cause there are nearly no similarities to what happened in the books. I could make a full list, but i think its not worth the web space filling, so i will only write down what i remember:1. In Bellatrix chamber the things inside are not just duplicating, they get very hot, so hot that they are burning them.... 2. Harry isn't telling anybody then Hermine and Ron about the Horcruxes and especially not Dumbledores brother... 3. The flames would have destroyed the diadem anyway so it wasn't necessary to kill it with the basilisk... at least not in the books... but in Davids world i guess its OK -.-' 4. The fight with Volde at the end was in front of all the people, but i guess Yates missed that too cause its certainly more expensive then just alone somewhere in the bush. 5. Harry repaired his own wand before he kept and never used the elder wand again until he would die so the power of it would vanish. 6. A looooottttt more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!All in all i hated the movie, in the last part of the movie i stopped watching the movie and was just thinking about how it is possible to make such a bad movie out of a wonderful book. Thanks David for making that possible!!!!!! PS.: Eng is not my foreign language, if u find spelling mistakes u can keep them :D"
"Yesterday i went to a private screening of the movie and here is what i though.Harry potter and the deathly hallows is the final volume in the award winning Harry Potter series and boy does it have a good send off. The acting, as usual is sensational and very convincing. Ralph Fiennes does a really amazing job at playing Lord Voldemort as he has done in all the previous movies.Lord Voldemort gets a lot of screen time and you should be please because he is really great.Also as usual, Daniel Radcliffe, Ruper Grint and Emma Watson are great as Harry,Ron and Hermione.Alan Rickman as Severus Snape is the best choice that could be done for the character as he is nearly exactly what i was imagining what he would be like when i read the book. I really do not need to tell you about his acting because its Alan Rickman and as usual he is fabulous. Michael Gambon is, as usual, a great Albus Dumbledore.Maggie Smith does a very very good Prof McGonagall...well you will have to see the movie to know what i mean but i am pretty sure you will like everything she does ! The film takes quite a few liberties from the book but to be honest, thats fine with me..one of the prime examples is the scene in the trailer where Harry and Lord Voldemort seem to hug and jump of a roof. In the trailer it looked odd and out of place but in the movie it looks pretty good and a lot less odd.The Battle for Hogwarts takes up about half the movie and is pretty spectacular and on a pretty large scale..well as spectacular as a PG-13 can be..there are so many explosions and things going on at the same time and it is just pure chaos,as the book intended i am sure, and its plain old fun to watch.Quite a few things happen in the battle that do not happen in the book but to be honest thats fine...doing a 100 percent adaptation would be a tough task and might not be as fun to watch.The movie does a great job, as the others did, at being funny seconds after a emotionally charged scene..and there are a lot of them ! I heard quite a bit of crying in all the moments you can imagine (if you have read the books) and also a lot of laughing.The special effects where very impressive, and well made if not a little over used.My only main problem with the movie is it did not need to be 3D.quite a few of the effects where clearly just to say look at me i am 3D !! It just did not feel needed. The sense of danger that Harry and crew face is very real and the director did a great job at making sure you are kept on your toes.The film is definitely the darkest in the saga so far and has quite a few intense scenes..Knowing how uptight censors can be its good that it gets away with a PG-13..I am trying to do the review without giving away too much because i am not keen on giving spoilers away at all but if you have any questions just ask and i will do my best to answer them. If you are a hardcore Harry Potter fan, you will most likely love it and it will be a whole bunch of fun.if you hate changes being made to the book chances are you will not love it so much...It may have a couple of flaws, which i am going to address below, but other than that its what it should be; a whole bunch of fun and a pretty good send of (or is it the end?) for the saga.The final scene is sweet and in all a good ending. When i left the theater it felt quite surreal as i have been nearly growing up with the Harry Potter saga, and it made me sad to know it was over..or as David Hayman said in the speech he gave before the movie, The end is just the beginning.My final thoughts on it are that its a pretty amazing end to a pretty amazing saga. (i am trying to improve my reviews little by little)"
"Elder Wand works despite cracking??? What is going on in this film??? Humor was placed at inappropriate times. It was supposed to be a hard, intense, fast-paced, all-out action, battle-hard, World War 2-kind of film, but this is anything but. Those who are in need of a good laugh might enjoy this film. Rowling's wizarding laws are completely decimated. Since when did Harry start 'sensing' horcruxes? Did Harry even possess this ability to 'sense' horcruxes to begin with? In that case, why didn't he realize that the diary in 'Chamber of Secrets' is a horcrux, and Slytherin's locket and Nagini in 'Deathly Hallows Part 1' are also horcruxes? In such as a situation, the trio would've been totally spared the trouble of wandering around like nomads (searching for the remaining horcruxes) like they did in Part 1. It doesn't even work that way. But then the previous adaptations were so horribly created (if you can call them adaptations, that is) that the film-makers had to tie up the loose ends somehow, and the end result is there for everybody to see. Oh yeah, Bellatrix and Voldemort burst and erupt like confetti when they die. And after Harry kills Voldemort, no one even cares two hoots about what has happened. They are all behaving as if Voldemort never even existed in the first place, drinking tea in the Great Hall (not even a ""Well done, Harry""). In that case, why did they even fear to speak his name for all these years?I am a fan of Rowling's writing. But the films have never lived up to that standard. And this one, I'm afraid, is no different."
"I went to this movie with high expectations considering the good job the makers had done with the first part,but all this movie did was leave a bad taste in my mouth and was ultimately a huge disappointment.I really did not get what the makers were trying to do in the end. It was as if they had lost the plot in the last half an hour.The movie to a certain part does keep in line with the book but just when you think this will be the best potter movie ever, it gets screwed up and screwed up big time.Daniel Radcliffe sleepwalks through the entire film probably just wanting to do away with the movie. Everybody else get bit role.The ending was a big disappointment especially for the people who have read the book.Voldemort looks unintentionally funny,especially his laugh after showing the dead body of Harry to everyone. I warn you this scene is really funny.I think everyone was laughing for this scene.His voice is also really bad,not at all fear inducing.I cant believe Harry did not get any applause for defeating 'the greatest dark lord in history'. A big joke really. Sure it is the end of an era and even i clapped when the movie ended but somehow the end was not that satisfying. Great graphics and the humour when intended has come out really well."
"First of all I must explain that I am a huge fan of the books. They practically taught me to read. This is perhaps why I found the film so devastatingly disappointing. It is worth noting that if you have never read the book you may find this film to be entertaining.The good: -The scene with the room of requirements is very accurate and entertaining. Especially with Harry saving Malfoy and Crabe dying. Helena Ravenclaw, he scene was spooky and pretty much the same as the book. However it just seemed so rushed.Neville was pretty much spot on. Just not enough air time.The Gringott's scene was accurate, but again so very very rushed. And that's pretty much it for the good.The Bad: -The constant pointless inaccuracies to the book. I'm well aware that things must be adapted when making a film from a book. But here they seem to change so many things, some important some not so important, for no particular reason. For example some of the Hogwarts students SEEM to be living in the room of requirement, so they can hide from Snape but they still go to the great hall, when he calls them. And when the battle for Hogwarts is about to begin, instead of evacuating all the under aged students out of the castle, they are allowed to fight, and the Sliverins are just kept in the dungeons. I won't list them all, as there are far far far too many to mention. But this is the main thing that really lets the film down.-Bits of the story that they failed to mention earlier in the films just appear out of no where, and carry on as if we've known about them all along. For example the ghost of Lupin talking about his son. Nowhere in the films is it mentioned that he has a son, and its actually a fairly big part of the book. -Fred's death is skated over very quickly. This is so disappointing, because in the book this is pretty much the biggest death. But before you know it, its over and Fred is never talked about again.-There is hardly any talk about the deathly hallows. No wait scrape that, there is pretty much NO talk of the deathly hallows, and it's the title of the FILM! Not even Dumbledore talks about them, and that is such a massive part of the book, and a massive part of Dumbledore.-The entire film should have been called ""Harry and the lost Cameo"" because that's what it is! Every other actor just seems to have cameos. Percy's on the good side all of a sudden. No explanation at all (a reoccurring theme with Yates, don't you think?).-Absolutely no Dumbledore back story. This is just such a huge part of the book.-The final fight scene Between Harry and Vol is just completely inaccurate. The whole point of Harry being the master of the Elder wand but not possessing it is that Vol can't cast any spells at Harry, and there he is shooting all sorts at him.-Voldemort's death is pathetic, plus its meant to take place in the great hall were everyone can see it. -One of the worst parts of this film is the epilogue. It takes place 19 years into the future. So I hoped they would have used different actor. NOPE instead they made a very poor attempt at ageing them all, by making Harry and Ron Fatter and Ginny and Hermione just plain frumpy. It's a horrible way to end a hugely disappointing film.I can't believe the film is being so well received, and I really can't believe that J.K. Rowling is happy with this film. If you're a lover of the books then please don't do it to yourself to watch this film. Just read the book again."
"I've been a big fan of the books having read each several times in the American and British versions. I was interested to see the movies knowing that there would be some changes required because of length and the fact that it is hard for movies to show thoughts. I have often been disappointed in each movie because of the illogical changes to plot lines beginning with Professor Quirrell not being harmed when he touches Harry but being destroyed when Harry touches him.The seventh movie in the series was the WORST for plot changes. Voldemort (the ""t"" is supposed to be silent) does extraordinary things with Dumbledore's wand, not because it's part of the plot, but because it makes more special effects possible. While, in the book, Harry never jumped off the school with Voldemort, it's added to the movie because it's another chance for unnecessary special effects.In the final battle, it isn't shown why Fred was the one killed. Whenever anyone ""good"" is killed, they simply fall over dead. Yet, when Bellatrix Lestrange and Voldemort explode into tiny black triangles(?). Neville's attainment of the sword of Griffindor after his speech to Voldemort and Harry's speech with Voldemort wherein he wraps up all the plot twists is changed to nonsense to allow the addition of more special effects.I've never been more upset after a movie, tho' having to waste $18 on totally worthless 3D effects didn't help."
"Some might stop reading by my review title, and that's okay. First thing to know if you want to keep reading is that i'm more than a huge fan of Harry Potter, books and movies (even though i love the books much more... however, while i haven't been on board with every decision on screen, i have LOVED all the films and they are my favorite films in the world. I understand they're not the best, but they are my personal favorite, and considering all the love they get, i can honestly say i'm not alone).So you might see where i'm going. I LOVED THE FILM! I just did. I have been waiting to death for this final installment and even from the first trailer it looked just epic. Obviously it came from the perfect finale from the book, but it still was hard to translate to screen. And they manage to do it perfectly for me. Spoilers from now on I cried my heart out (especially since Snape dies), i laughed (well, they included more jokes than i would have intended, but boy i laughed) and my heart was beating all the way through the fastest 2 hours of my life. And you can't just have a better cinema experience.Now, as an adaptation it is good. There are many things missing from the 2nd part that i won't ignore and some things could have been better, but they conveyed the main theme, sticked to that and made an awesome film. Although even at my 2nd viewing i'm not still convinced with Ron and Hermione just letting him go to die so easily, that should have been like the book.But that's just it: so many things can be added, but the film is just so amazing as it is. It has EPIC written all over it, and the finale we had all been waiting for. The battle scenes were breathtaking, and the characters were at its best.As usual, but even more this time, the production was great: visual effects were top notch and deserve the academy award; Desplat outdid himself with the score, and while i loved part 1's he creates the music so fitting and so beautiful that made us all bawl; Stuart Craig needs the Oscar, enough said; Serra made some beautiful and memorable shots, editing good, etc.The acting was actually very good from the trio and mainly from anyone, but it is obvious who stands out: Alan Rickman as Snape. Seriously, i was very afraid of this scene, and they did it beautifully (they cut many things but did it perfect). Alan not only made us cry, but he gave a very VERY strong performance.So many things could be said about this perfect final film for this incredible series of films. David Yates (who directed this incredibly) created an amazing send-off to this story (in the films of course) that will stay in many of our hearts, and personally it shall never leave mine.So go see the final film or miss the amazing final film of a series that has changed millions of us... into much better people. Thanks Jo, i can't ever thank you enough."
"The one that ends it all, after 8 films (7 books) in the wizarding world, Harry finally has a showdown with He Who Has No Nose, and it's rather confusing, but also satisfying, and other than Harry and Valdemort, the other characters who get to shine are Mrs. Weasley, who gets fed up and dispatches Bellatrix, Neville Longbottom, who singlehandedly stands up against Valdemort despite everyone laughing at him, and it is he who offs Valdemort's snake, the last vestige of his soul, allowing Harry to finish him of - and Neville also gets the girl (Luna Lovegood, a cute couple), and finally there's Severus Snape, who turns out not to be a villain after all, but endured a lot as he infiltrated Valdemort's ranks in a plan that eventually proved fatal, and all because he loved Harry's mother from afar. In the end, Harry looks upon Snape as one the bravest, noblest men he's ever known, or ever will know. So yeah, a very entertaining conclusion."
"*contains spoilers.I saw the movie a few days back and was utterly disappointed with David Yates. what was that anyway?! Seriously, David, did you read the book or was it what you heard from the fans that made you do the film that way. even that would be bad if it had been told by a fan.first of all, the good points. 1. the Gringotts scene was good but could have been better. 2. the room of requirement scene leaving the part when harry found the diadem(in the box!!!!!). 3. the cinematography. the bad points, lots of them. 1. why did Griphook want the Gryfindor's sword we all wonder. 2. whats with the Huffelpuff's cup to be selected by Voldermort for a Horucrux??? i.e. his fetish for the important things. 3. Dumbeldore's life and lies. nothing we hear about it. 4. the school, what were all the students doing there at that moment??? 5. harry found the diadem in a box(shining)!!!! 6. no justice done to the battle of Hogwarts. come on it was supposed to be a battle! 7. death of Fred Weasly and the Percy's famous dialog ""minister i forgot to give you my resignation"" was not shown. even after wards Fred was not mentioned. 8. what was that when molly Wesley got Bellatrix? she just burst up into god knows what! where was the dead body? it showed that the death eaters did not turn to just dead bodies! 9. what was that speech by Neville when he should be killing nagini which he did though after taking much of the unwanted screen time. 10. harry when first brought in by hagrid was supposed to be shocking but leaving Ginny others took it quiet calmly. 11. then the best part harry and voldemort playing hide and seek and we see voldemort battling harry with the elder wand that was supposedly not be working against harry. we should have seen voldermort after casting the death spell which after deflecting by harry's disarming spell hit voldermort and he should have been dead like each of the others coming to the same end after death as equal but he had to be different for Yates... he blows up!!! amusing. 12. now coming to the best part. i literally had my hands on my head when this was shown. harry breaks the elder wand into two and throws it. can it be done!!! what harm would have it done if he could have stuck to the book? 13. the epilogue was disastrous. no more on that.on the whole a good script already prepared by J.K.Rowling wasted by Yates."
"This final Harry Potter movie might be one of the worst films in years. But only if you've read the books. If you didn't read the books, it's nice and entertaining. The acting is quite good and the special effects are amazing. If you did read the books, it's absolutely dreadful. I consider myself to be a Harry Potter fan. I just love the books, I've read them all a couple of times. Especially the last one ""The Deadly Hallows"" is one of the best books I've read, even though this is a children's book. The whole story comes together beautifully.But in this movie, The Deadly Hallows Part 2, the magic that the book offers is completely absent. In the first movies, some of the details were a little bit different from the books. It annoyed me, but I could understand it. It made the movies more watchable and you can't get every detail from a book into a movie can you? But here! Not only a few details are different, everything is different! I would expect a few scenes to be faster or more dramatic, but there are whole parts of the movie that are nowhere to be found in the books. I simply can't understand why they've changed so much. I wonder if I've read a different version of the book than the directors. They just made up whole new scenes. Imagine Frodo in Lord of the Rings not dropping the ring into a volcano of lava but in one of tar. Imagine everyone but Frodo sailing away in to the west in the end. That would make the whole thing kinda different right? Why is the whole school called in front of Snape, while the key figures are supposed to be hiding in the room of requirement? Why does Harry just reveal himself to Snape instead of in a classroom with the Carrows? Why doesn't Harry reveal himself to be still alive once Mrs Weasley has killed Bellatrix Lestrange? But no, he's already running around and fighting with Voldemort. And why does Voldemort go up in smoke once killed? This is all wrong. I give the movie a 2 for effort. If you like the books, don't watch this movie, it might ruin the story you love."
"The final nail is hammered into the coffin of Harry Potter as the series dies in a stupid action-fest. I'm going to list three reasons I dislike this movie and the direction the Harry Potter films have taken, and then I'll let you all lynch me.1. ToneTone is important to a movie. You can make it dark, or light-hearted, or funny, or scary, but if you mix it up too much you'll end up with a film that's hard to take seriously. Harry Potter started off as a charming phenomenon for kids - the peril was mild, we were constantly meeting magical new people and creatures and it was all great. Then we come to this movie, and by now I've got no idea what the tone is meant to be. It's certainly not a light-hearted movie for kids any more. It's not really an adult film either. You've got something close to horror in one scene, and then you've got comedy, and then romance, and it's hard to tell when you're meant to be excited or laughing or scared. The constant humour and the earlier films have established this universe as a very light-hearted one, and so when we're introduced to Voldemort and his big, evil taking-over-the-world plan, there's not really much of a sense of danger. People try to tell me that the series has grown and matured as its audience has grown and matured. Now, I started reading the books when I was very young, so I'm part of that audience. I'd rather appreciate it if people stopped feeding me that crap - you pick a tone and you stick with it, or I won't be able to take anything seriously.2. No TensionYou can spend as much as you want on amazing visuals and complex action sequences, but they won't be exciting unless you make the audience care. I have to be worried about whether the protagonists will succeed, and the obstacles need to be hard to overcome. In the earlier films, they had interesting obstacles: look at the first film, where they had to get past a series of tests to get to the philosopher's stone. Then in the second, they hatched a plan to transform into other people in order to sneak around. It was tense; they could get caught.The new films may have cool visual effects, but they're unimaginative. The phrase ""deus ex machina"" sums up a lot of this movie. For example, they enter the bank. Holy crap, a giant dragon! How will they overcome this?! Oh, don't worry, this goblin guy is just going to ring a bell. Yeah, keep ringing... There we go, problem solved. Wow, how exciting! Now, let's get the thing we came in to get which the audience doesn't care about... Oh no, the room's filling up with gold, but I'll just keep going and... Yeah, there we go, got the thing. Now, let's leave. Oh, no! The place is collapsing! How will we get out?! Oh, a massive flying dragon we can ride on. That's convenient. Off we go!It just felt like a series of things which happened. Every obstacle had some immediate and convenient resolution. Even when Harry died we all knew that he'd just somehow come back to life. It just sucks out all the tension.3. Harry Potter is RuinedLike I was saying earlier, remember how Harry Potter used to be a charming adventure for kids? By the end of this series, that's all gone. They don't spend much time in the magical castle, they spend it in the dull English countryside. Every book used to be a fun adventure at Hogwarts, which was full of mystery as well as familiar, enjoyable people and settings. Now our lovable fictional universe is the setting for some uninteresting conflict which we don't really care about. JK Rowling wants to make a load of points about modern issues and politics. In the end, these turn out to be very shallow, broad, and uninteresting. Here's a hint: your books got popular because we wanted to read about Harry's magical adventures, not the Ministry of Magic getting taken over by Nazis. Oh, no, wait, it's a serious series for adults now, no more childish fun to be had here. Anyone who watched George Lucas ruin the Star Wars franchise with the prequel films will see that mirrored here: iconic, wonderful, interesting things from the earlier films are shoved into the film in excess. George Lucas had a billion lightsabre duels. In Harry Potter we've got a massive fight with wands. It looks amazing; bolts of red and green stuff flying all over the place, people getting knocked down, things exploding... But that's not the point of wands. Think back to the duel between Harry and Malfoy in the Chamber of Secrets. That looked rubbish. It was small. But it was far more exciting and gripping than hundreds of wands discharging all over the room like they're laser guns. Likewise, remember the duel between Harry and Voldemort at the end of the fourth film. Different coloured streaks of magic stuff came out of the end of each wand and the only real action was in Harry's face going grrrrhnnngrrrr... But that was great - it was the first proper face-off between Harry and his mortal enemy; it was a clash of good and evil, an exciting showdown with the villain. Now all that's been ruined.There are many more things I could list. The fanboys will hate me in any case. But this simply wasn't a good film, and the magic of Harry Potter is long gone."
"Deathly Hallows works all right as a film, I suppose. My enjoyment of it was just spoilt by the total lack of respect shown by the director and scriptwriter for the source matériel. The book had a rather good plot and not bad characters. Would it have hurt the film that much to include any of that. No, all of that was junked to put in scenes that had nothing to do with the plot of the book, twist and slant other parts of the book plot, ignore quite a lot of important book points and simply never refer to the main plot point of the book at all. Does anyone recall anything about what the Deathly Hallows actually were and how many Harry had, if indeed he had any?So OK film, terrible, terrible adaption."
"I found other comments from boards and posts around the net, I found that I agree with all of them. I'm a fan of the books and Yates ruined the franchise. He sucked out all of the magic and unnecessarily changed key parts of the story or left them out all together.Other HP fans on the film: ""I think that the film missed too many points of the books.If Voldemort could feel the horcruxes being destroyed, he would have changed their location in book 6.Things Just Happen: for example when Harry gets Resurrection stone, he doesn't turn it three times. The spirits just appear.People were laughing in the cinema for many many things, not because they were funny, but because there was bad acting, bad lines, bad effects. Imagine most of the theater laughing for the mauled Voldemort in Harry's dream.Unnecessary changes. Why every wizard can fly without brooms? It was supposed to be Voldemort's specialty. That sucked big time.Making exciting moments of the books so boring or omitting them totally. In the book it was so exciting to have Harry wonder in the castle with his cloak.Blowing up a bridge with 100 death eaters on it  wait? There was a bridge in Hogwarts? Wait, at the end there is another bridge on top of some bottomless valley.Voldemort's death, final battle, watch 8 movies and at the end Voldemort dies with bad CGI effect. There was no dynamics. The book's version was million times better with Harry telling things and what he had understood. And Bellatrix didn't blow up in bits and pieces. It seems to me that killing people with CGI effects is OK to show to kids. Killing people as it would happen in ""real life"" isn't. Yates decided that the movie had to be shot from his personal point of view, as a director, pitiful fight scenes, saw little action the whole movie and if you did they were short. 1. It failed to create a satisfactory ending for all characters. Where was Neville being surrounded by admirers? Where was Kreacher in the battle of Hogwarts? How was Percy suddenly reunited with his family? etc.2. It left out the whole Dumbledore and Grindelwald plot which i thought was great in the book. It started it in part 1 but never really finished it. There was no possible reason i can think off to remove this from the film other than stupidity.3. The final battle was neither as epic or as dark as was promised. It never created that sense of peril that it should of done or the sense of finale that it also should of done.4. It never explained why Harry survived Voldemort's killing curse. Dumbledore wanders on and tells the audience the one thing that they already bloody knew (which was that harry was a horcrux) failing to explain anything else.5. It differed far to much from the book which was amazing. I can't understand the logic of taking something amazing and changing it so that its not.6. The snake lasted longer than Bellatrix Lestrange in a fight. Plus Bellatrix blew up for some reason. Went for comedy rather than epicness.7. The final conversation between Harry and Voldemort was cut out. Plus Voldemort died without anyone watching and by somehow evaporating.8. Where was Grawp and Hagrid in the battle. In fact where was everyone. The battle scenes were surprisingly short.1) Scenes were awkward and dragged out 2) Shell cottage was on a cliff on a beachnot just on straight up sand 3)Bill's face was hardly maimed 4) If you hadn't read the book you'd have no idea how Hermione became Bellatrix or for what cause 5) Nothing is explained""Everyone else said it for me. I hate Yates for ruining Harry Potter, but at least we have the books."
"An atrocity was committed tonight. One of the highest order. Worse than the horror that was 6th movie. Dare I say worse even then the terror that Voldemort inspired? I do. It was absolutely dreadful. And how J.K. Rowling approved of this ending to her brilliant series, I will never know.I kept a tally of the mistakes they made tonight. By my count, there were 95 of them. NINETY-FIVE! That is absolutely ridiculous. Now before I begin the list I must make note of two points. The first is that some mistakes were so atrocious that I multiply counted those for these are the ones that absolutely should not have been avoided. These are the ones that represent the spirit of the series and us, the fans. And thus by destroying them, the film has destroyed a part of us as well. The second point is that there were many minor mistakes as well. But these need not be counted for they are not the ones that matter.Now I understand that there is a need to go for theatricality. But they could have done so and followed the books. Look at adaptations of LotR and Stephen King. Those follow the original works amazingly. And those books aren't nearly as popular as Harry Potter has become. Harry Potter is not only popular, but also a gateway. It is the start of a path for many to begin reading. And as such it deserves the utmost care and respect.Do you know what happens when someone sees a horrible movie based off a book they haven't read? They almost always do not want to read the book. That saddens me greatly. The movies don't have to be as good the books. I'd never expect that. But they could try a hell of a lot harder. And by not trying they're effectively killing off a large portion of passionate readers, would be writers, and amazing creativity.Worse than that though is the number of us who have essentially dedicated our lives to the series. And many of us have put so much stock in the series, that it is a huge slap in the face. No. Worse than that. It's like they've destroyed a part of our soul.For myself at least, I identified so much so with Harry that when I first started the series, I longed for nothing more than to go to Hogwarts. To belong somewhere. To no longer be mistreated and ignored by friends and family. (For those of them that read this, yes, I was sorely mistaken about this then. But I never knew it at the time) And then strangely enough, I got my acceptance letter. I got into a college where I was accepted readily by my peers regardless of my beliefs. At college I found my Hogwarts, my Gryffindor, my Ron, my Hermione, my Neville, my Luna. And while at college, I lost my grandmother. She is my Dumbledore, even now. She guides me at every step.Perhaps I am outrageous in my claims to many. In fact I hope that is the case because that would mean that only a few share my sad experience. Alas, I do not believe this to be the case. I think that many people connect with the books on as deep a level as I did even if perhaps they did not know why. It is to those deeper connections that I write to now. But even so, I write this for myself because my soul cannot sit idly by as a crime such as this is committed against it.For the full review go here: https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150225265191370 If you've made it this far, I commend you and thank you for reading this.

"Everything that could have been said about this movie has probably been said.WHAT I LIKED: -I feel like I was the only one who really appreciated the use of humor in the movie, it was perfect. I loved the jokes and their timing. While this wasn't close to a comedy, it kept the charming humor of the previous Harry Potter movies and I appreciated that the movie didn't take itself TOO seriously.-Showing Hermione destroying the Horcrux. This was a scene I really hoped they'd show. In the book it was a brief mention. In the movie, they show the full scene. I also liked that, if they couldn't have Ron's comment defending the house elves as the reason Hermione kissed him, this was the next best reason.-Neville and Luna had larger roles in this movie. I was particularly pleased with Luna's larger role and that she had the guts to put Harry in his place.-The CGI was pretty good.-The acting is VERY good.-They change JK Rowling's plan in one minor way- by putting Neville and Luna together. TOO CUTE!! And just perfect!! -The original HP theme from the first movie at the end. It made me very emotional. I loved that they used John William's piece instead of making a new one. How sweet.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE -The timing was all wrong. The scene in which Mrs. Weasley kills Bellatrix Lestrange is just bizarrely placed, almost like they would have cut that scene if her one-liner hadn't become so famous.-Since when do people explode when they die? -Harry kills Voldemort without using his famous spell... it's just a random burst of red light from his wand. Not only that, Voldemort bursts into ashes. Random. An there's no dialog between them, just fighting. There's no one to see Harry finish him. A terrible way to change a great scene from the book.-There was NO explanation for ANYTHING!! I mean it, they set up Gridelwald's story... then never do anything with it. They never mention the third of the Deathly Hallows- the cloak. They never explain why Harry knows that Lupin has a son. They don't explain Dumbledore's back story, and so hinting to it is just frustrating. They never explain what happens to Harry's wand. They even don't explain why Harry isn't killed for real when Voldemort kills him. All in all, as a reader of the book, I understood it all but anyone who hadn't read it would be pretty lost.-Snape's flashbacks. They were okay but I hated the scenes of him crying over Lily's body in Godric's Hollow. EW!! It was creepy, never mentioned in the book, and almost seemed stalkerish. It didn't make me want to like Snape, it made me cringe!! Not only that, they never really explain that Snape was never Voldemort's after Lily's death.-Young Lily's eyes are very much BROWN in the flashbacks. They couldn't have put in some colored contacts? -No one looked 19 years older in the future scene. They looked weird. The prosthetic team failed miserably.-The future scene didn't show the kids much. Actually there was no dialog except between Harry and Albus. They couldn't have made the movie 5 minutes longer? All in all, they really should have explained more like in the last movie. It felt rushed. And confusing. Not the worst of the Potter movies (Goblet of Fire was worst) but not the best (Chamber of Secrets was best). So I gave it a 6. Pretty good. But not great."
"SPOILER ALERTI can't believe the way they ended the movie, and when the epilogue came i got up from my seat and walked out early. I hated the epilogue in the book, so I decided not to relive the horror. WHY DID THEY NOT SHOW HARRY FIXING HIS OLD WAND??? They just forgot that he needs a real wand and the one he has that works he breaks in half(elder wand). Well, the movie was so far off from the book... i left angry... angry is not the feeling I should have felt; i am part of the Harry Potter generation and i feel cheated. I know that many people love the movie (most of the people in the theater) and maybe if i see it once more i will enjoy it more. I really hope that they have an alternate ending in the DVD or something to semi redeem it. Why did they add more action and take out little things that really made a huge difference to me when i read the book? This ISN'T supposed to be an action movie, but they sure seem to think it should be..."
"The movie is emotionless. And in the climax the movie really lacks of heroic feeling, rejoice & hype. Actually the movie is only 2 hours, still got some free time to extend, maybe 10 more minutes in the scene when Harry Potter died, more time to explain about Master of Death & Deathly Hallows. It's so shameful, the essence & main story of the last series, like in the title ""Deathly Hallows"" has no portion in this movie. That's the climax part that should be has some heroic feeling, ""wow"" feeling and eager but it's just flat in this movie!I understand that they can't put all stories to the movie because of the time limit, but that's one of the main story beside hunting the hocrux, ooo my :(Through out the movie, I didn't feel anything, sadness, rejoice. It's just a flat movie with great action :)"
"Fifteen years of tireless, incredible hard work from some of the best of Britain's storytelling talent, supported by an equally faithful and eagerly devoted fan base, now culminates in the cinematic experience of a lifetime. Ever since the frothily juvenile but still undeniably good quality Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone first hit cinema screens in 2001, the Harry Potter saga has experienced countless crucial plot developments, more and more introductions of new characters and actors, several new directors and frequent changes of tone, all to give an astounding and vastly rewarding end result. As a stand-alone film, this largely action heavy film would most likely be dismissed as merely glitzy uninspired bore, but our familiarity and previously established emotional connection with these characters and their stories means that we are holding our breath during every dangerous moment instead sitting back indifferently and indulging in ego- boosting cynicism. Today's moviegoers will not just simply throw away their sympathy and compassion at any tortured, miserable face a director puts on the screen, unless the film in question is a serious depiction of a real-life tragedy. However, when it comes to the Harry Potter characters, there is a remarkable type of long-term relationship that has been built over our long period of acquaintanceship with them, transcending the usual barriers that are placed in front of fictional characters and ultimately making this an impossibly lovable and endlessly enthralling movie.Part 2 of the final chapter initially continues in the vein of its taut yet gloomy predecessor, showing our three effortlessly likable main heroes on their believably difficult quest to locate and destroy Lord Voldemort's horcruxes. Whilst searching, they must constantly be on the lookout for any of the dark lord's ever more numerous agents who are trying furiously to hunt them down. In addition to the vicious death eaters, many other wizard folk who were formerly opposing him have now begun to join his side of the battle out of a deep-seated fear. Others have simply found it easier and simpler to continue drifting along living sheltered lives and being, for the moment, cocooned from the horrors taking place outside. After the comically inept Ministry of Magic was swiftly overthrown, most of its employees have been compliantly carrying on with their everyday work, even though they know what they are contributing to. The same applies to the sedentary yet sinister Gringotts goblins, as we see when the trio makes a clumsy infiltration of the almost impenetrable wizard bank in order to find the next horcrux in a frivolously entertaining early action sequence that, like the opening sequences of the similarly paced Indiana Jones series, is a wonderful appetiser.However, nostalgically like the first six Potter installments, the bulk of this film takes place at the historic Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, placing the search for the remaining horcruxes in a profoundly different environment and atmosphere. Instead of feeling alone and helpless surrounded by nonchalant and corrupt citizens, they are amongst the most loyal and supportive friends anyone could wish for. The infallible trust and beautiful hope we see in their eyes as they see that Harry has arrived to rally them all into finally facing off the forces of evil that are oppressing them is astonishingly touching.However, this is all sadly a double-edged sword, with terrible consequences being presented as well as good points. Voldemort predicted that Harry would return to Hogwarts at some point to seek the aid of his old allies and is ready for him when he arrives. When he makes a full-scale siege on the castle in order to extract Harry, the hundreds of teachers and older students as well as the surviving members of the Order put up a fiercely brave struggle against a colossal dark army of snatchers, giants and death eaters. With the ongoing fatalities and mortal injuries, Harry's conscious is pricked by the thought that he is letting them down as ""the Chosen One"" by not being able to defend them. Our empathy is certainly with Harry as the guilt and the doubts overwhelm him, but it is clear that his friends would much rather die in this horrific battle then join Voldemort and gutlessly scavenge an undeserved existence. They stare in the face of terrible danger and somehow know that this can be overcome in the end.This rebellious spirit is supported Voldemort's visible deterioration. He cares only about avoiding death at any cost, and so he has in fact resorted to scavenging that miserable existence, with horrifying results. As the horcruxes are disappearing, he is experiencing a gradual destruction of the soul that is far worse than death. His final demise is far from sudden: the direction from David Yates drops small hints and artistic allusions that show the formerly great and powerful figure slowly being reduced to nothing. That this has all been depicted so effectively is largely attributed to the masterful acting from Ralph Feinnes, who has managed brilliantly to create a very fascinating character. It is often mentioned that the cast is filled with an abundance of accomplished British actors that help significantly to lift the status of the films. While there are countless acting veterans listed in the credits, apart from Feinnes, it is really only Rickman, Gambon, Maggie Smith and Helena Bonham Carter that are given a decent amount to flourish with. Matthew Lewis is another standout, giving a terrific performance incredibly noble, righteous and heroic Neville Longbottom.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is a film undoubtedly about loyalty, and both its characters and its fans are in the end rewarded by it. For that, and all of the other reasons, I look forward to seeing this gem soar up the top 250 as far as it can possibly go, and I hope it really pushes the buttons of the arrogant anti-Potter cynics when it land near the top."
"(I apologize for any misspellings of character names in advance.) I grew up with Harry and the gang. I spent my evenings waiting at the bookstore until Midnight, eagerly expecting the next book of the series. I wasn't disappointed. I cried at the end of the 7th book; I expected to do the same at the end of the 8th movie.I walked into the theater with 10 misty-eyed buddies, three boxes of Kleenex, and expectations high (I loved the 7th movie.) I walked out of the theater with 10 confused buddies, three unused boxes of Kleenex, and a feeling of slight disappointment.What went wrong??? The Good: Gringotts was flawless. Loved everything about it.Neville, Professor McGonagal, and Mrs. Weasely were awesome in every sense of the word. Their moments of epic earned well-deserving applause and standing ovations from the audience.Snape's death. I never react to movies, but I gasped and grabbed my friend when he was killed. Only time I got tearful through out the whole film. Perfection.Battle of Hogwarts. With a few exceptions (you'll read those later) it was well done.And now....the bad.Tonks and Lupin. Their whole 'we have a son' thing was really random and shoved in. How the heck did Harry know? He was traipsing around the countryside! Very confusing.Dumbledore. His back story, his acting...I'm sorry, the guy was terrible. Him and Harry was an awful moment for everyone, regardless if you read the books or not.Fred's death was way too underplayed. I don't know if they were shooting for the ""oh, he's just one amongst many' thing, but I was disappointed. You couldn't even tell it was Fred! It could've been Percy or Bill for all they showed!The Snape/Lily Montage. It was cute....for the first 10 minuets. Then I all I could think was ""Can we speed this along, please?"" It was awkward and lengthy. I'm all for showing the soft underbelly of grouchy semi-evil Snape, but suddenly throwing a weeping, puppy dogged eyed Snape who moons after Lily for, like, ever, was a 3000 degree character turn-around and ruined his character for me. Too much, too fast.There were several other moments of ""Well, that was disappointing"" or ""Whoa, that was amazing!"", but those were the big ones.The bad moments were equaled out by the good....for the most part. The HP saga ended on a decent note, but it was not the tear-jerking awesomeness that I was expecting."
"No i didn't love it cause its the last one, but out of all of them i've seen, this is probably the only and the first out of all 8 of them i actually really enjoyed.The beginning- Bang Bang good! The Middle- I'm on the edge of my seat! The End- I jumped out of my seat and screamed, eff yeah!I in my 2 years of being a Rookie Critic have never done that watching a Harry Potter Film.Don't let anyone spoil it, it doesn't need anymore to say But just""WOW""! My first 10 out 10 of all the Harry Potter MoviesIt deserves nothing more than at least ""Worthy Best Picture nomination""It may be late at night but heck, this is really rare from me to actually remember a Harry Potter Film.Farely well to Harry Potter, this outstanding film will be remembered, Sincerely."
"-CONTAINS SPOILERS-The Bad Sides: 1. Lacked emotions. Seriously HP-7 lacked friendship, love everything. In one scene, when Harry walks to the Forbidden Forest to sacrifice himself...after ALL these times of being together, fighting together,..Hermione just cried and gave him a hug and did NOTHING. Ron was just standing there, saying nothing. What kind of friendship is this? They were supposed to be best friends! It got way away from the book.2. No real jokes.3. In one scene when Dumbledore's brother asked Harry where is Dobby, Harry answers so bluntly and quickly as if it doesn't matter at all - ""He's dead"".4. There were loop holes all around the place, no history about Ariana, Dumbledore, Horcruxes, and most horrible thing is that Harry breaks the elder wand whereas it was to be used to fix his real wand! And....etc.5. In the last scene, the boy who acted as Albus Severus...is a stupid child...they all sounded like ROBOTS. And no freaking jokes or punchlines! They totally ruined the ending.6. After killing Voldemort, OMG, no cheering no nothing? I was puzzled for a second if anybody knew that he really died or not...! It's awful.7. After Harry's 'dead' body was carried to the Hogwarts, except for Ginny everyone took it simply, I mean what the hell? You guys are all wooden characters!The only good side of this movie was when Harry got into Snape's memory, I cried again for Snape. :'(I'm really disappointed because Harry Potter series is my most favorite book series! I expected better."
"By the end of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 everyone was ready for one thing, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2!!! And on July 15, 2011 at 12: 05 I got the privilege of experiencing the end of my favorite series. I was with other die hards so it was a great experience. I remember watching the first Harry Potter movie when I was 5 with my mom in the theater. I was immediately hooked and looking back I didn't realize how much this series would shape my life. The movie is a non stop action movie from beginning to end. By the time Harry kills Voldemort and he's sending his own son to Hogwarts 19 years later it was a very emotional film. Alan Rickman gives a truly heartbreaking performance as a tragic Snape. The film is a whole new level of epic. The CGI in the film might be the best all year. If this film does not win an Oscar for Set Design and SFX then something is seriously wrong. The score is also incredible.On a whole this film will definitely be on the top of my Best Film's of 2011 list. It's easily the best HP film.I loved this film and I will always love the series. I will cherish the memories thanks to the series. Thank you Harry for the best 10 years ever. And thank you for my childhood."
"For many fans (and let me get this out now: I am one of them), this is  much more than just another film in the franchise: it's the it's the  end of an era, or simply the end of a journey which lasted for over 10  years (14 if you count the first book, back in 1997). There are no  precedents like this in movie history... There's a certain poignancy  that comes with it, because, as we all know, this is the last one EVER.  There will not be any other Harry Potter, no matter what. The film  clearly knows all that and consciously plays to it, tapping into our  deepest-self, reminding us about this journey we've taken and how we've  grown up with it.   The previously-unknown David Yates has slowly been able to find his own  voice with the latest 4 of the 8 instalments, by combining the sense of  magic the first 2 films had, the darker tone introduced to us by Afonso  Cuaron (with the third episode) but also that more grown-up approach to  the story, which has been brewing and growing with each chapter (and  book of course), but he also had the courage to actually hack to pieces  the overly-written source and actually make a better film (clearly  after book 3, no editor would dare to tell JK Rowling to cut anything  out). In this last ""Deathly Hallow"", he was able to basically stretch  the final battle over the course of the whole film, making it seem  greater and more epic than it's ever been in the book (In the end, box  office aside, it really did pay off to split the movie in two parts).  Considering the incredible amount of expectations which a film like  this can carry and, consequently, the almost impossible task of  bringing everything to a close, HP 7.2 does a really good job! Yes, of  course there will be some disappointed people, but I think the  disappointment will come from the fact that secretly each of us would  like this story to go on forever and, no matter what, you can never  please everyone. Considering what a massive commercial machine Warner  Bros is we must be so thankful for the way the franchise has been  handled. Producer David Heyman is obviously a man of heart, who cares  for his fans and set out to make the best films he could ever make,  playing on the strengths of its (let's be honest) not-so-perfect source  and in the end making it an even better product. In the end this film  must be judged with that same heart and not so much with the brain,  taking in consideration the series as well as this ending.  And you know what? My heart can't stop saying ""I just loved the  journey, thank you so much for it"
"Likes: -Snape's finale. We finally got to see behind his cold exterior, albeit, rushed.Gringott's break OUT (not break IN). I thought the scene at the front desk was ridiculously drawn out, but the break out with the dragon was pretty cool. Also, I've never liked the goblins as portrayed in the movies and they're particularly aggravating in this one because they're all wearing adorable, tiny pants suits.Ron and Hermione's kiss. It was cute. :o) Harry's conversations with the goblin and Ollivander.The resurrection stone scene.The scene with Dumbledore.The Gray Lady scene.Gripes: Ginny Weasley. I'm not sure if it was the directing or the acting, but that girl was completely lacking any passion or conviction.The goofy one-liners. Just when you think these movies have finally grown up, Ron throws in a breathless ""Wicked"" and you're back to it feeling like it was made for eight-year-olds.The final battle scene. Visually, it was pretty cool but it utterly lacked dramatic weight and kept jumping from random violence (poor Lavender) to juvenile humor. I was disappointed Neville didn't get a chance to shine, and what I expected to be a grand duel between Mrs. Weasley and Bellatrix ended up being incredibly bland.I felt pretty disappointed at the end of HPATDH:P2, but I was also kind of relieved. Relief first because, thank goodness, the hype is over. They're done. The books and the movies are officially finished and we can obsess over something else (Hunger Games? Breaking Dawn 1 & 2? I digress.) However, I was disappointed with this movie for the same reasons I was disappointed with other installments - it lacked grit and was often poorly acted. Where it should have been dark and serious, it was polished and cutesy. I liked Part 1 a lot better, not because it was very close to the book, but because it seemed to follow the same pace and mood as the book without leaving out too many important elements. Part 2 rushed along plot wise without even leaving you time to digest what had just happened, yet it dragged miserably when it came to dialogue and actual acting. I was expecting great performances from these kids and it seemed as if they were either desperately running from one predicament to the next or just standing around. Overall, I think it was an issue with the director not setting the tone very well. The book delved swiftly and deeply into a dark and dramatic plot, and ended up concluding well. The movie shifted awkwardly from drama to cutesy kid-friendly crap."
"After three days I'm still a little torn when thinking of the end of the Harry Potter movies.On one hand, I really liked the movie. They managed to bring the whole battle of Hogwarts on screen. But precisely because the last movie consists almost ONLY of the last battle at Hogwarts, I get the feeling that something is missing.Currently, I'm trying to come to terms with the fact that there will be no more Potter movies and therefore no chance to ever see the parts they left out on screen. One thing that will bother me forever - and almost ruined one of the greatest moments of the books for me - is the story of Teddy Lupin. In 7.1. Tonks starts to mention something that should hint at her pregnancy, but she doesn't really say anything about it and those people who haven't read the books will probably forget about that hint quickly. In 7.2. we never get told about Teddy's birth. And then, completely out of the blue, in the scene where Harry walks to his death (the most emotional scene of the books - I cried so hard during reading that!), Remus suddenly says something like ""My son will one day understand what I died for"". Everyone in the cinema was like WTF?! We never before - or AFTER in the epilogue - heard of Teddy. Why did they have to mention him in that scene then? Destroyed the feeling of that scene almost completely, because everyone in the cinema was just really confused and whispering about it.They could have added the part in Shell Cottage where Remus comes in and tells everyone that Tonks gave birth to a boy. That way Remus' words in the forest wouldn't have been so out of place and it would have given the movie a peaceful scene apart from the whole battle.One thing they really did brilliantly was the Prince's Tale (apart from the fact that they filmed it in a boathouse rather than the Shrieking Shack - why do they have chance something like this? I don't get it! I mean the Shrieking Shack has a deep meaning for the protagonists and is already a familiar place for the audience!). But otherwise that scene was great! Alan Rickman was brilliant in that scene! It's disappointing however that Dumbledore's tale was never fully brought on screen. It was so important in the books and so very effective in showing that Dumbledore was also only human and had a dark past. In the movie Harry simply says that he trusts Dumbledore, but in the book he gets doubts about the man and rightly so. It bothers me even more because they once again gave so many hints about his past, but nothing of importance was filmed and it leaves us hanging with the feeling that his story is not being told.That's something I feel in every Potter movie since the third movie. There are so many hints and half-told stories, but we never get the whole picture of it (except if you have read the books). I know that it is impossible to get EVERYTHING on screen that happens in the books, but I really feel like there could have been MORE. We never even hear of Voldemorts past and his parentage.Furthermore, there are a lot of little details that bother me, even though it doesn't really take away the fun in watching the movies. E.g. Harry's eye colour! In the books they are green. Just like his mother's. They even mention it in the movies that they have the same eyes. But the actors have different eye colours! Couldn't they have used contacts?? Also that Dumbledore doesn't wear his half moon glasses or that Tonks doesn't change her hair colour (except in the fifth movie) and many more little details that would have added to the simple magic of Harry Potter.It also bugs me that we never see Wormtail die. I loved that part in the books where he strangles himself with his silver hand, but we never see what happens to him in the movies.It's also a pity that Harry and Voldemort have their last showdown alone. The part where Voldemort realised that he can't hurt anyone in the castle anymore, because Harry sacrificed himself for them, was very powerful in the books.What I loved and I'm really grateful for, is the fact that Neville still got to behead Nagini. I was already scared when he got knocked out that they would change that part and let someone else do the job, but then out of nowhere Neville appeared and killed Nagini - great moment in the movie!! I love the music and love all the actors - Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Dan Radcliffe and Tom Felton were especially brilliant here! I adore some parts of the movie, some had me left wanting more. But that was to be expected.I think it's a real pity that there wasn't someone here who loves the books so much to consider all the little details and the whole background story, like Peter Jackson did with The Lord of the Rings. That love for details and that devotion for the story is really missing in the Harry Potter movies. The style of each movie is different. A lot of the story is missing. Details are being left out which are important - especially for real fans of the books. The Harry Potter series really would have deserved to be taken on by someone like Peter Jackson! All in all, I think the movies as stand-alone are great! But as a real fan of the books you shouldn't compare it or you'll be disappointed."
"There are an awful lot of reviews talking about how this film is 'the best yet' and how it 'ticks all the boxes' or is 'a must for fans'. It is none of these!7 years ago I walked out of watching the 3rd film cursing and swearing out loud about how poor the conversion of book to film had been done. Scenes dropped and changed for 'time considerations' whilst others were invented and thrust in- all creating plot holes that did not exist in the novel. This time I walked out praying that I live long enough to see someone take the books and redo the ENTIRE series properly, using the obvious failures done in the films to date as a road map for improvement.**SPOILERS**It is, unfortunately, near impossible to give a proper review of this film without including at least some spoilers. Whilst one can make generic statements such as 'divergence from source material is too great', 'plot holes cause a lack of integrity' and 'over editing leads to a lack of connection to the characters' none of it means too much without going into at least a little detail.Simple things such as not showing the death of Fred, despite having gone into George's injury so well in part 1, or the massively powerful and indestructible Elder Wand being snapped in half with little to no effort whatsoever are good examples. Bellatrix's wand was more durable for god's sake!Meanwhile, having just spent an entire previous film searching for Horcruxes they suddenly jump from finding one in the form of a cup based on logical deduction to guessing where the next one is on what appears to be a whim. For the sake of taking 90 seconds of screen time to mention that the ring was Slytherin's and the goblet was Hufflepuff's, and it would seem logical for Voldemort's ego to have a desire to stamp his dark magic on a legendary item for each of the 4 founders- therefore Ravenclaw would be a good place to look next- instead Yate's goes and has the characters make a crazy leap of logic for which they need to endanger their lives with no apparent reason behind it whatsoever. This is storytelling of the lowest calibre!These things aren't just failures to adapt the book correctly when to do so would have been better than making alteration, they are basic failures of storytelling that any student on a film or writing course would have lost marks on if it were an assignment. These plot holes, discontinuities, omissions and alienations are in such great number that if it were an assignment it would, in fact, have been lucky to scrape through with a D as a result!No doubt we will see the score of this film drop over time as more and more people- particularly on 2nd watching, or seeing it for the first time on an average size TV or ten years from now when special effects technology has moved on- find the imagery far less awe inspiring than the films flaws. At that point the realisation will kick in that this is actually a very poor rendition of the source material that almost any hack director could have put out just as well if not better with the budget and cast/crew available to hand."
"I was a late-comer to the Harry Potter series. I saw the Sorcerer's Stone for the first time right before the Half Blood Prince came out. Within a month of that first experience with the wizarding world, I saw all the films and read all the books thrice. I was hooked.The books are excellent in that they capture the innocence of youth and the pain of reality in a beautiful dichotomy that both kids and adults can relate with and enjoy. They are engaging, flow extremely well, and keep you on your toes the whole way through. They're as much mystery as fantasy, making the reader a part of the discovery process, and are a delight to read.The films, up to this point, portrayed those concepts brilliantly. The first two were bright, fun, and drew you in to a fascinating, surprising world. The middle three began to slowly grow darker, pulling you deeper into the emotions, fears, and relationships of the characters. The sixth and first half of the seventh saw the characters you had grown to love being forced to grow up quickly, confront their fears, and fight for their lives. It was with great excitement that I went into this final film...knowing that it was to house both the climax of the action and the final resolution.Following the movie, I walked out of the theater unsatisfied and annoyed. I'm not going to go on a tirade about what was left out that was in the books. That has been done exhaustively already. Instead, I will simply say that this movie ""missed it."" It missed the pain of the story. The physical pain of hot treasure in the vault was omitted. The emotional pain of Fred, Lupin, and Tonks' deaths seemed an afterthought, being given about 20 seconds. Where was the pain of Hagrid thinking Harry dead? Where was the pain of Helena Ravenclaw and her tragedy with the Bloody Baron? Where was Draco's pain, having lost two of his closest ""friends?"" The answer, there wasn't any. No pain at all.It missed the drama and emotion of the story. Aberforth had no emotion at all in his 10 second tirade on his brother (before Harry dismissed the conversation). The pensieve scenes were short, awkward, and didn't explain much of anything. Alan Rickman's tears while holding Lily were the only believable emotion in the entire film. And then there was Harry going to his death. Instead of him leaving the headmaster's office alone and walking straight to the forest, it saw him awkwardly informing Hermione of his plan, receiving an even more awkward hug, and then having an even more awkward talk with his parents, Serius, and Lupin (you'd think having only been able to talk to his parents for about 20 seconds during the priori incantatum in the graveyard in his life, that he'd at least look at his father more than once). Snape died in a boathouse instead of the symbolic shrieking shack where so many historical events had occurred. Neville's speech was embarrassing, and Voldemort's mannerisms after he thought Harry dead were laughable. The acting just seemed forced the entire way through. Emma and Rupert had no chemistry...seeming uncomfortable around each other. Overall, I wasn't drawn in, I was just watching things happen on a screen.It missed the action of the story. Yes, that's right. I don't care how many statues, giants, or dragon you have. I wanted to see Voldemort dueling three people at once. I wanted to see Kingsley Shacklebolt tearing into someone. I wanted to see Molly fight for more than 8 seconds with Bellatrix (and a little more passion in her cussing the woman who had just almost killed her daughter would have been nice). I wanted to see house elves stabbing people in the ankles with knives and centaur arrow wounds. Instead, I got a lot of giants with big sticks, a bridge exploding, and 3 minutes of chasing a snake around. The battles in the books were so good because real people whom you knew and really wanted to win fought them. This just looked like the fight scene at the end of Russell Crowe's Robin Hood with wands.Finally, it missed the closure of the story. Voldemort was not killed in a single, decisive moment. Instead, it consisted of 10 minutes of rolling, flying, physical punching (by the most powerful wizard in the world), and eventually a standoff where no words were spoken and Voldemort died by breaking into pieces and floating away. That might work in Transformers, but not the Potterverse. The bridge scene at the end with the disposal of the Elder Wand looked like they threw it in because they forgot to film anything else, and the epilogue was painfully awkward.While the movie had good special effects, it sadly played out more like a smash-fest Transformers than an emotionally charged Gladiator or Braveheart. It had some humor, but that was the closest thing to real emotion or drama you could find. Here's to Snape...the single redeeming factor in the entire film. I'm sorry to see the franchise go out this way. Maybe they'll release an extended edition that will redeem it somewhat. Here's to hoping."
"I had really high expectations for Part 2 based on the plot JKR had written brilliantly and the trailers that seemed really amazing. The film in general wasn't bad at all... but there were certain things that made my disappointment inevitable.However, let's start with the good stuff: - The visual & sound effects: I think that the visual effects (including the effects at the battle, the dragon, etc.) and the background music worked very well and gave the film a great touch. - Snape's tale: One of the rare parts of the film I really really liked. Sure, they left some things out (which was to be expected) but the overall scene and especially the performance by Alan Rickman was exceptional and touching. - Gringotts: A nicely done scene (speaking in general) and a great performance by Helena B. Carter. The flight with the dragon was short but nicely done and accompanied by some fine music. However I also have some complaints about it as well. - The scenery: I especially liked Gringotts and King's cross. - The epilogue: I think it was quite acceptable and the actors were well artificially aged. (Except for Emma but hey... how can you make miss beauty herself older?:D)The disappointments (uh, where to start?) - It is more than obvious that Yates isn't really good when it comes to action scenes. (even if he is still my favorite hp director -or... was?) For starters at Gringotts, everything is too passive (they are detected but still get to the vault unharmed and climb on a dragon's back without getting hit by a curse.) That makes me question whether Gringotts is really that impossible to break in&out according to Yates? - Since when does pollyjuice potion not change your voice into the voice of the person you changed into?? If that was true, how could have B. Crouch Jr. pretended he was Moody for a whole year? Explain that producers/director! - They left out the entire Dumbledore's story? OK it may have been a 'sacrifice' but hey... I can't accept that. - Reemus&Tonks have a son? Well I wouldn't have known that for sure if I hadn't read the book. A stupid mistake... they shouldn't have brought it up if they weren't planning any explanation, then :/ - The death of Fred and the arrival of Percy... I got a feeling: 'it happened, let's go on with our lives.' - Voldemort's death... Not epic at all!! Probably the biggest disappointment. The end of the film should have been a blast not a by-the-way-scene. Not to mention his 'blasting into confetti' (as well as Bellatrix & Nagini) which was so not like the book. - NOT TO MENTION the scene after Voldemort's death. Harry comes into the great hall with a cup of tea, people talking like they are in a bar, no one notices anything, no joy, no emotion... all you hear is Slughorn's story how he once lost his wand and see Filch sweeping the ruins. - Which reminds me! The wannabe 'funny scenes' for example Filch, Ron saying: 'harry talks in his sleep...' (sooo not like in the book), Neville shouting: 'yeah, you and whose army?' (that phrase is soooo old! -.-) etc... may be an addition to the film but really didn't fit in. Everyone was in life threatening situation... why would they say something like that? It broke the tension and I didn't like that. - Harry snapping the Elder wand and not mending his own... Really? Is that the solution to make a scene that would last 2 minutes only 30seconds long? Overall... I think the film wasn't epic enough. As a Harry Potter fan I expected this film to be an emotional blast... a film that would make your jaws fall to the floor and not sleep for two days. I expected a 'boom' at the end, I would have accepted a cheesy applause accompanied by a strong song when Harry victoriously returns after defeating Voldemort for starters! But nothing... it left me cold and disappointed. It was unable to capture the 'epicness' of the book on so many levels(except for Snape's tale). In my opinion, the franchise should have ended with a bigger emotional blast so that people would never forget it. Of course I will never forget it... but I will remember the books rather than the films."
"It actually took me years to watch the first 3 Harry Potter movies, which I considered to be aimed straight at kids. Once I did, I really found myself enjoying them (especially Prisoner of Azkaban, IMHO the best of the series), so I decided to get the books.I've read them twice since them, and found them entertaining - and I thought the first three movies were very faithful to them, given the time constraints.It all seemed to change with Order of The Phoenix, though. While the earlier movies felt like a story being told, OOP was more like a bunch of disjointed scenes that the viewer had to assemble into a plot. I thought The Half Blood Prince was the worst - from talking with friends, it was obvious there was so much stuff thrown out from the books some things didn't make any sense at all (as if, who cared who The Half Blood Prince was - the movie never made it obvious).Enter the epic finale. Once I finished reading the last HP book, I was pretty surprised J.K. Rowling actually made simply the best ending I could ever think of, and wondered how it'd look on the big screen. One word: terrible. Director David Yates should have been fired a long time ago (after Half Blood Prince) - and the Deathly Hallows suffers under his helm. It's completely disjointed - even though he had two movies to tell the story, the MAJOR plot points are missing: the real Albus Dumbledore life story, Kreacher's conversion, Snape's story, Harry's decision to seek the Horcruxes instead of the Hallows, the real way Harry defeated Voldemort, the sacrifices some of the characters went through (and the deaths of some major ones) - it's all gone or severely cut, and it was replaced by tons of CGI and lame one-liners.I suppose WB thought they'd rather go for epic fights, instead of telling the entire story as it was meant to be told, fearing people would not understand it. Sad.I have to wonder whether people who didn't read the books understand where the mirror came from, why Dumbledore's brother was still angry at him, why Neville killed Nagini when only Ron and Hermione knew they had to, and why Dumbledore used Harry the way he did. I guess not."
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part II was always going to be big and epic and pompous, all of which it delivers. It was also going to be the movie that ends the Harry Potter series, which is something it struggles with a bit more. Beginning with a brief flashback of part 1's final shot, the movie picks of exactly were the last ended. It does so though, without ever feeling forced or abrupt, rather letting the first five or ten minutes be conversations (Griphook and Ollivander respectively) before turning the heat on. After that, the movie attacks you with such ferocity you barely breathe until the ending scene. However, the action is always controlled. This could easily have been destroyed by trying to make it into a classic war movie, but though Yates dips in with plenty of battle scenes, he never goes the full Michael Bay. All in all, you end up feeling they might have shown more, letting a few key deaths happen off screen, but for the all-important PG-rating. As for following the book, from the start of it keeps the distance needed to make it film able whilst still remaining true to the material. As we near the end of the battle it differs even more, yet still letting the events happen more or less like in the novel, and though it differs most in the climactic showdown, fans of the novel will be delighted to know the epilogue is translated nearly word by word. The performances are stellar; Maggie Smith shines, as does Matthew Lewis and Radcliff does his best to carry the movie, a feat in which he mostly succeeds. For me though, the standout actors are, of course, Alan Rickman, giving his Snape a whole new dimension, but also, possibly surprising; Cieran Hinds as Aberforth Dumbledore. It isn't a big role, but he portrays it with such charisma and gravitas (especially one fantastic shot) I ended up wondering if he wouldn't have made a better Albus than Gambon. Alas, to late for that now. Despite this I have only given it a 6. Why? Because it lacks the soul and warmth it should have had. Sure there are scenes (the forest springs to mind at once) that puts pressure on your tear canals, but it isn't enough, there is not a strong enough feeling of conclusion, it just doesn't quite deliver. In the end, it never manages to top the ending from Philosophers Stone. As a conclusion, it is the same old criticism that has plagued the movie-series – the books were better. And though it is magnificently grand and spectacular, it sadly never really becomes the ""Return of the King"" it ought to have been."
"it was very much disappointing. the first 5 parts were taken nicely, started very well.in order to make more money, the last two parts of deathly hallow was taken giving out just disappointments.in previous parts it took more time to find the ho-crux. it took time to find how to destroy it. in hp7 every 15 to 20 minutes ho-crux was found and destroyed.hp7 was confusing to understand. my least favorite part is the ending where harry defeats Voldemort. I was expecting something more. the poorest by director David Yates."
"When something great comes to a end you can't help, but feel a certain level of sadness. The new millennium has given birth to two of the greatest franchise ( Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings) that cinema has seen since the original Star Wars.Its very rare to witness not only one film masterpiece, but two is just extraordinary. The Harry Potter films contain the best story telling, action, human connection to the audience and bring out the most emotion of the characters I have ever seen in a franchise. Its amazing to see the transition that the Harry Potter films have taken from innocence kid friendly movies, to when our generation matured, so did the films. They became more dark and more developed with intensity of story and character building. This film is fulfilling, sad and satisfying. The factor that has kept these movies looking amazing is the cinematography and effect that have stayed constant through the film through the years. The film has those two elements and more working for it which makes it the best film in the Potter franchise. This franchise has kept it's flame burning strong for 10 years and director David Yates sends this Wizard series away in the best fashion it could achieve. This movie has to be the best out of the 8 films and combined everything that someone would be looking for in a Harry Potter film and also displays everything that fans of the series have been looking for and that the amount of action.I thought that Transformers Dark of the Moon delivered the most action of the summer and I was wrong. Harry Potter gives the audience the most action that a film can contain combined with the highest level of emotion I have ever seen.Deathly Hollows Part 2 contains the most heart, pure emotion and extreme action I have ever seen in cinema since the original Star Wars. The pacing of this film does not let the audience catch their breath when witnessing this masterpiece. Their is so much to see and so much to take in that if you blink you will miss out something great. This movie delivers everything that someone from critics and fans would be looking for in a close out film. All credit in my opinion goes to the director, David Yates, for bringing this kid friendly movie up to speed with the maturity level that the books brought over the course of their time. Yates and all director of the franchise did the best job transforming the JK Rowling book series into box office hits that has been accepted warmly by fans and critic. But by far David Yates has done the best job of pulling emotions out of his cast, making them relateable to the audience and creating a certain tone for the viewer to witness and grasps the gravity that is going on in the closing journey of Harry Potter. He has done the best job of well rounding his movies that they are not only entertaining, but also makes the audience yearn for more Harry Potter films. I also give a lot of credit to the main cast members from Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and Ralph Fiennes. They all have done a great job of shaping the memories of the famous novel character into visual ones that have made an imprint into the viewers mind and they have done the best jobs that young to old actors can do with this sort of property. They are all equally nice to watch and bring so much passion to the film that the audience cant help, but notice dedication to the movies.It's not only the main characters that show the greatest acting and hear, but also the secondary actors bring a lot to the film and all pleasant to watching. This movie franchise is made it's mark in the world of cinema as one of the greatest series that have ever been viewed and this film wraps the franchise up in the best way possible. This is possibly the best film of the year and of the past 10 years. All good things do come to a end sooner or later and it has been a heck of a journey, and I?M)m glad I was able to experience it."
"I don't think it matters whether you are a fan of the books or not to be able to come to the conclusion that this is the worst Harry Potter film of all and one of the most over-rated films ever! I have not read all of the books which means that I have a fairly unbiased view when watching the films-I'm not expecting the film to follow the books exactly.This film was awful for several reasons: 1)Lack of dialogue- what's the point in paying the actors millions of pounds for them to say virtually nothing throughout...apart from Harry and frankly I would rather he remained quite throughout because his voice and wimpy demeanour irritate me! 2)Poor action scenes- for example an exchange between Harry and Voldermort- was pathetic. It wasn't an intense duel; it was poorly acted.3)Wooden acting- for example the romance between Ron and Hermione- you could tell how uncomfortable they felt together! And the ending is incredibly poor- it was too abrupt and didn't connect smoothly to the rest of the film- a rush job I think.I can't believe this film is expected to gross the most money of all the films. And I can't believe I actually PAID to see it...I would have to be paid to see it again that's for sure! Don't waste your money and time (2hours40mins)on this film even if, like me, you're going to see it just because it's the last ever films- it's the worst of the lot!"
"The previously-unknown David Yates has slowly been able to find his own voice with the latest 4 of the 8 instalments, by combining the sense of magic the first 2 films had, the darker tone introduced to us by Afonso Cuaron (with the third episode) but also that more grown-up approach to the story, which has been brewing and growing with each chapter (and book of course), but he also had the courage to actually hack to pieces the overly-written source and actually make a better film (clearly after book 3, no editor would dare to tell JK Rowling to cut anything out). In this last ""Deathly Hallow"", he was able to basically stretch the final battle over the course of the whole film, making it seem greater and more epic than it's ever been in the book (In the end, box office aside, it really did pay off to split the movie in two parts).Considering the incredible amount of expectations which a film like this can carry and, consequently, the almost impossible task of bringing everything to a close, HP 7.2 does a really good job! Yes, of course there will be some disappointed people, but I think the disappointment will come from the fact that secretly each of us would like this story to go on forever and, no matter what, you can never please everyone. Considering what a massive commercial machine Warner Bros is we must be so thankful for the way the franchise has been handled. Producer David Heyman is obviously a man of heart, who cares for his fans and set out to make the best films he could ever make, playing on the strengths of its (let's be honest) not-so-perfect source and in the end making it an even better product. In the end this film must be judged with that same heart and not so much with the brain, taking in consideration the series as well as this ending."
"It has been a long time coming, but the Harry Potter series has come to an end, and on a positive note to boot. I was lucky enough to catch it at a midnight screening, where the atmosphere and anticipation was unbelievably high, as you would expect! Having read all seven books (albeit some time ago) and regardless of me knowing what should be happening while I watched the movie, there were many unexpected moments to savor. Aside from a couple of minor nuances, I left the cinema very pleased that the franchise was given such a wonderful end.This movie is just about everything a fan of the series could want. A plot that manages to incorporate all major events from the book along with an ever-present haunting tone throughout. Virtually every major and minor character from the novel gets some form of appearance as well. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and Voldermort's (Ralph Fiennes) battle was a little short for my liking, however its intensity made up for a lack of length. In terms of rounding off an adventure, this movie did a solid job.The movie's intro is short and sweet, throwing you directly into the end of where the first left you, which is great. Pacing is, for the most part, cleverly done. The movie's action sequences are balanced nicely with some more reflective moments. This is where Snape (Alan Rickman) shines. His screen time was actually much less than what I was anticipating, but he makes excellent use of what time he has. You can't help but feel some form of empathy for Rickman's character as his story unfolds. It almost steals the show.Tone and lighting were done to perfection. We've come a long way from the cheery and very colorful opening films to the gritty and dark ones in the past few years. The darkness continues increasing to an exciting crescendo in this movie. There is again a ridiculously limited color palette to the scenes, but it's appropriate. They've become evident since the third film, The Prisoner of Azkaban. Some don't and won't like it, but it all feels worthwhile now for the climax in this final chapter.The film is by far not perfect though. The movie felt a tad broken up and rushed in several parts, particularly in some battle scenes towards the conclusion of the film. Sometimes we would be thrown from one place to the next unnecessarily. Some will like the chaotic pacing in these parts, but for me it gave an impression of easiness to the lead trio's task of destroying horcruxes (which the books show it was anything but). It's almost as if they were simple side tasks before the final confrontation, instead of crucial and necessary steps they should have been.The biggest criticism of the film must lie in its ignorance of any character that happens to not be named Harry Potter. Because of this, many relationships between other characters don't feel developed enough. Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) are constantly distanced from Harry. When you compare the book to the film you almost feel that anything outside of Harry was tacked onto the story line here. The concept of 'good' vs. 'evil' seems to be lost and substituted with 'Harry' vs. 'Voldermort.' People would argue that that's how it should be, but that doesn't do justice to the other characters present. There was nothing more painful though than seeing some people swept aside like they never existed.But, for almost everyone, the intense build-up to the final encounter between Voldermort and Harry will make up for that. Ralph Fiennes as Voldermort is as menacing as ever playing the pale-skinned antagonist. Notable appearances that deserve a mention include Helena Bonham Carter (as Bellatrix Lestrange) and John Hurt (as Ollivander) with amusing and pensive roles respectively.The attention to visual details is also amazing. Hogwarts, where majority of the film's setting takes place, changes dramatically as the film goes on. You almost feel trapped within the school with the other characters as the darkness draws nearer. The school, ironically, never felt so alive during this movie. Sound and music were as sharp as any of the previous movies, and contributed to this wonderful mood.In the end, the film rounds off well. Although I despised it in the book, the final scene, and in particular the final shot of the film, brought a smile to my face. A superb ending to a franchise that's been magical in more ways than one.7.5/10"
"While never an avid Harry Potter fan, I have watched all eight Harry Potter films on the big screen over the past decade. It's been a long, bumpy ride, with some films stronger than others - mainly the first few (in my own honest opinion). After a while, however, it all felt like the biggest cinematic tease ever. I mean, we've been told about Voldermort ever since the beginning, and we've known all along that the saga will end with this big, epic fight between good and evil... err, I mean Harry vs. Voldermort. However, that never came (except for a few teases here and there), and when the producers decided to postpone the inedible and split the last film into two, it became ever so frustrating.Thanks god, then, that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 came along to right all the wrongs the previous films have made and to give us the proper closure we've all been waiting for. Finally, after all this time, we get to see the main protagonist for more than a glance. We get resolutions to plot lines that began in parts 6 & 7, Hogwarts makes an awesome comeback for one, final stand between forces between both sides, and there are even some twists and turns that echo all the way back to parts 1 & 2.So yes, THIS is the Harry Potter we've all been waiting for all along: edgy, dark, more mature and complex than ever before, with solid performances from all involved (especially Ralph Fiennes, who gets some space to play with his character, and that guy that plays Neville Longbottom, who grew up to become quite a man from that mousy little kid he once was). But more so - and unlike any of the other films in the series – HP7b stands as an independent piece (alongside its 2010 counterpart), and doesn't leave the viewer unsatisfied. Here, we get a proper ending, we know this is the Harry Potter to end all 800 or so films that came before, and it seems that the producers knew this and gave it all they could. I only wish they've done this more often during the previous films, instead of saving the best for last.All in all, this is THE best Harry Potter I've seen from all the eight, and a truly exciting roller coaster of a film, filled with top notch storytelling alongside impressive special effects (even the 3D felt appropriate and relevant). I gave it a very solid 9 out of 10."
"A decade, a generation and we can finally say goodbye to Harry Potter. It's an epic finale to a very long journey that seemed will never end. The movie begins with the last final minutes of Part I where Voldemort open's Dumbledore's grave to steal his wand which I think was a good opening. The story goes very fast from there on as there's much to be told and rhythm keeps the audience on their toes, it's a roller coaster.David Yates has become better and better by each movie and especially in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 he shows that despite the critiques' he's able to control the pace and give us an insight into the characters beautifully. In the final movie I think he wasn't able to control everything as successfully which could be due to the fact that there was a lot to cover. Unfortunately this could be seen in the edit too and some of the cuts seemed a bit rushed and there was continuity issues, in fact the whole movie looked rushed. This was especially visible in the King's Cross sequence with the lack of linking shots between the cuts although not damaging the storyline but creating jumps between the cuts. Overall everything works and it's a pleasing experience, however, I think the book's fans will make a better connection to this film as many of the flashbacks in the movie are very short, vague and could be even a bit confusing. The Snape's back story for example which is a very critical piece of information could have been much better explained and visualised.Acting is very good as expected from a line of prestigious British actors, and Daniel Radcliffe has a better performance as well and he is less dry when he speaks which I think it's his downside as his facial expressions particularly in the last movie are brilliant. I found Voldemort's character to be more creepy and sad than scary! His portrayal in the book is much stronger but movies don't and don't really have to follow the books line by line. The actor chosen as Harry's son in the epilogue is sadly very poor and I've found the entire epilogue's sequence not to be that great actually and somehow unnecessary if it was to be shown like this, but it's always interesting to see a glimpse of the future I suppose.Soundtrack composed by Alexandre Desplat which carries on from Part I with a nicely frames shots of Eduardo Serra are nicely blended together and you can hardly notice the soundtrack on its own, a complement to how well it's been integrated.The majority of the Visual Effects, if not all, are provided by the London Houses such Double Negative, Cinesite, MPC and Framestore where I was a part of their team. Overall outstanding work and definitely worthy of an Oscar nomination. I wouldn't say it's the best VFX work I've seen in my life but they are all serving the story extremely well with nothing extra just as it should be. I wasn't surprised but a bit disappointed that in the premiere the producers and director thanked everyone except the visual effects artist who actually made this happen. VFX's important is yet to be recognised.It's not easy to say good-bye but it is the time. Harry Potter and the deathly Hollows Part II is an entertaining movie that tries to say a lot in little time. Despite the minor points I've mentioned I don't think anyone will leave the theatre unsatisfied and the movie even deserves a second viewing."
They went for dramatic visuals and effects rather than follow a good storyline.Lots of changes to the books and scenes added for cinematic view.They do not care about the books or the storyline as long as it looks good and they can get in 3d shots.You also wont see a more anti climatic end to a film ever.After a decade of movies they finally kill the most dark evil wizard of all time and nobody gives a monkeys.Well done David Yates for ruining the harry potter franchise.YOU directed 4 movies and ruined everyone of them.Order of the phoenix was the longest book but the shortest movie.Half blood prince was butchered beyond recognition.Deathly hallows part 1 was dragged out too long and was boring.Lets hope you do not get a chance to ruin anymore movies.
"I am a large fan of the harry potter books and have enjoyed watching at least the early Harry Potter movies. I must say however this is a horribly disappointing movie seemingly made by a production team who have no intuition at all.When adapting a book into a movie there are two things which distinguish the amazing movie from the disappointing ones: 1- The little things, the small details which the fans really want to see portrayed, even in the background.2- The secondary characters are extremely important to the viewers.My main issue with this movie is that it lacks both of these in a massive way, leaving out the little thins and focusing way too much on harry.It is a terrible adaptation, removing the magic from the whole movie, making it a cheesy battle movie which MAKES NO SENSE ACCORDING THE THE WORLD WHICH WE KNOW AS POTTER!! Issues of stupidity in the movie- - Harry appirates to diagon alley, not under the invisibility cloak then waits around for a chat in the lane-way. Seriously this is just a ridiculous error when everyone is looking for him.WHY IS THE BRIDGE BLOWN UP OMG!!! In all seriousness this is so stupid. I was getting used to the fact that Yates decided the death-eaters can all now fly, so why blow up a bridge. It is just stupid!!! They can fly over and THEY HAVE MAGIC WANDS or go across another bridge.All of the snatchers! They don't even hit Neville as he runs, and he somehow manages to hit it behind him as he runs, (wat?) They instead of using their magic abilities they all just fall into the abyss! Another stupid error - Why did harry break the elder wand? No further comment - Why would the people hiding out in the room of requirement be happy enough to just go down to the great hall when Snape summons them.Issues of disappointment in the movie- -NO FRED DEATH, NO TONKS DEATH, NO LUPIN DEATH.-Mrs Weasley vs. Bellatrix. The most fearful thing about Bellatrix is her taunting words yet in this pivotal scene we don't see any build up of taunting about Ginny and Fred - Why was Voldemort not destroyed in the hall in front of everyone. It was important that Voldemorts rage at Harry should have been shown as harry believes he will win the fight. We needed to see Mcgonagall, Kingsley and Slughorn fighting Voldemort to show his strength and show harry isn't the only one standing up to Voldemort. Issues of annoyance in the movie- -SO MUCH OF HARRY AND VOLDEMORT JUST RUNNING AROUND, pointless and boring - Why is there no footage of Mcgonagall, Lupin, Fred, George, Dean, Seamus, Ginny fighting in the actually battle. Seriously they left all the good characters we wanted to see out of the battle.Mrs Weasley why do you know how to make a massive shield. WHY NOT ARTHUR WHO ACTUALLY WORKS AT THE MINISTRY. Another silly idea from David Yates.-Why do Bellatrix and Voldemort burst into little pieces WHY WHY WHY -We really wanted to see the Ravenclaw common room and Amycus Carrow abusing Mcgonagall. That would've been a great scene to see, Harry defending Mcgonagall with the Cruciatus curse. Yates has completely rejected the enormous power of words in conveyed hatred, menace and friendship.The two massive issues Overall the most disappointing thing is the lack of secondary character involvement in the battle of Hogwarts. Characters which we needed to see actually fighting in the battle included Prof. Sprout, HAGRID Slughorn, All of the Weasleys, Lupin and Tonks. Some characters which it would've been nice to see is the fat lady, sir Cadogan, Nearly Headless Nick, Peeves,fang, Buckbeak, Grawp and the professors portraits.Essentially Yates had removed the magic from this movie. Wizards not using any named spells and simply shooting light from their wand as if it doesn't even mean anything. The magical creatures all left out with the exception of pointless giants without Grawp even there to attack them.Overall I give this 2/10 simply because I love the series and ultimately if i continued to speak on this movies failures i would downgrade it to 1/10. So disappointing for such a great story to be abused in this way"
"David Yates is one of those directors you either hate or love. If you have never read the book, there is a chance you might like/love his work. If you have read the book, there is a very high chance you want to grab hold of him and stuff the vomit-est vomit flavored Bertie Bott's beans in large amount of quantities in a particular orifice that ...well I leave it to your imagination. I have read the book and I hate his work, his sloppy story lines, his directing of the actors/actresses are hideously horrendous. If ever you want to make a comparison, watch Goblet of Fire and there is a distinct difference in the way the acting is done. This review is about HP7B- HP7B is better than the order of phoenix and very much better than the HBP. I like how he sped the entire 1st part up and yet made the storyline rather polished...then it slowed to crap. Like the HBP, if you have read the book & might have imagined Dumbledore's death much better than what Mr Yates had put out on screen; you know he clearly lacks imagination in delivering real emotion to cinema-goers. Such is the case when Harry finds out he is porky pig walking to a large oven filled with green green light that will bake him to crisp. I was surprised Daniel Radcliff acted pretty well at the end, the mud streaked face and perpetual soot covered all over look made him look very much like a potential murder victim. I also liked certain parts I thought clever like the shield around Hogwarts, very Final Fantasy like; oh an the elaboration of Ron n Hermione destroying the cup- thank you very much, I always thought JK rushed through that part rather carelessly. But again, the snog-ging o the snogging, must it be so well...necessary and fake. Then there was the ending, my point about Mr Yate's lack of ability to deliver proper emotion to ticket holders exact. Zap zap and zap zap and then Volde dies, then oh lets just waltz back to school. No yelling whooping cheering elation screams of joy clap hands stadiums filled with ecstasy. Just ... Nothing, the sickest baddest mother of naughty wizards without noses has finally been killed! zip nothing. It seemed like Mr. Yates ran out of budget, time, creativity towards the end and quickly sped through the script for the sake of making tons of muggle gold. Then the worst thing happened- the wand of destiny, the death-stick, the branch of doom, the amazingness fantastic-est bes-test most sought after stick of power! The ONE STICK TO RULE THEM ALL!! The one link to the DEATHLY HALLOWS was snapped like a brittle piece of instant noodle by a teenage boy. He wrangled that thing like an irritating wet fibrous piece of wood and tossed it away. All for the sake of not having to explain too much. Yes! Mr Yates, the reason readers really hate you is, you take short cuts just because of your inept ability to tell good stories in film- you did not want to explain too much how Harry could survive Voldy's zap, you were just too lazy to elaborate on the Deathly Hallows and did not trust us to understand wand lore. The result is, HP7B is very much a confusing movie for muggle readers and to those who have been magically blessed to read the book, it lacks imagination. 8.4 on IMDb! Pffttttt what a load of crock."
"I have to say I was really disappointed by the final Harry Potter film. This is the opening weekend, and the reviewers are all raving... and they are all wrong; it's like they saw a different film than I did -- is it because I didn't read the book? I've generally enjoyed the films, but this was far from the best Potter film -- and frankly it leaves me continuing to wonder how this series managed to stay so beloved and highly hyped for so long. Really, this is what it was all building to for all these years?The kids put on Prisoner of Azkaban this morning; ah, the good 'ol days. That's the film I think of when I think of Harry Potter."
"I'm taking no reserves by telling this film is awful. By far the worst film I've seen this year, and that wouldn't be if there hadn't been so much hype about it.Every critic and every website praise this film, however I can't begin to understand how can they praise such a poor production. An irregular, cyclic, inconsistent and plot-hole-filled script, a lousy direction incapable of maintaining an action sequence long enough to have a good time and an edition work to be embarrassed (with a tighter edition you could reduce both parts into a single film). If part 1 was bad, this one kicks the bucket big time!Acting doesn't improve too much, we still get all the wooden performances we're used to and the same plot line is filled with clichés and things we've seen over and over again. It's to admire the ability of J.K. Rowling to develop intriguing situations and by the same time her incapability to resolve them with wit and style.The action sequences just pass by, the plot line is pitiful, the final battle doesn't leave a mark and the epilogue is completely unnecessary. Maybe I'm insane, and maybe everyone will think I'm out of line by giving this film 1 star out of 10, but when you grow up admiring the greatest fantasy and sci-fi sagas ever made (either in the film or book industry) like Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Dune, Blade Runner and the Neverending Story, you'll know Harry Potter just doesn't have enough to be in the same rank as them."
"I was looking forward to seeing the finale of the potter series, as the other films have been quite well presented. The latest 3 movies however have cutout vital bits of the story and the finale is just a joke. The film started off quite fast relative to the book, the whole breaking into Gringots scence was poorly adapted from the book. The final chapters of the book where 100 times better than the final parts of the film. When harry looks through Snape's memories it is way to brief, in the book a lot of emotion was shown as Snape saw the downfall to the relationship to himself and Harry potters mother. The battle between harry and Voldemort was truly disappointing as the director changed the engagement into battle between the two (and other main factors that I will not spoil for people reading this review). The positioning of Hagrid's whereabouts in the film pretty much show how poorly adapted the book was. They didn't even put in the line about Neville becoming a professor at the end.In conclusion I found the film very disappointing, I don't know why cinemas are showing it in 3D as it barely uses any 3d effects. 4*/10* A huge disappointment."
"If I have to put up with 5 and 6 to get a finale this good, I'm willing to make that sacrifice. As close to a perfect conclusion as you can get. After a decade of solid films, DH2 delivers in truly epic fashion. Hogwarts goes to war against Voldemort's forces, and all 7 previous films are built upon and explored here. There's not much I need to say other than that. It's acted well, the effects are great, the writing's great, and it's a damn satisfying conclusion."
"What am I doing writing a review for, possibly, the most highly anticipated series finale-8 years after its debut?Well, for starters, I'm not saying anything that hasn't been said, I'm sure. I took the Potter train at my own pace, reading all the books and watching all the movies in the past year. Frankly, it's a miracle it wasn't spoiled for me after all this time!But I'm adding my two cents a few years late, maybe just to validate the feelings of those who felt them first.I was head-over-heels excited about 93% of this movie. So much of it was spot on! In fact, it was so damn near perfect, 30 minutes in, I was dying to see the end because it was proving to be such an epic, faithful recreation! But then, right as we near the close there were some huge misses. Scenes Rowling's words formed so clearly in my mind's eye, the thought that they never got to be realized on-screen as a part of this series, truly breaks my heart. For me, it all revolves around that final showdown.1. Harry and Voldemort's final confrontation should have taken place as it did in the book, in the midst of EVERYONE. Not just the battle, the verbal beat-down. One of the most satisfying moments is Harry just laying Voldemort's dirty laundry out for all to see. As they circle each other, once and for all Harry tells all who can hear exactly how it went down. He unmasks Tom Riddle and all his lies, he vindicates Snape, he obliterates all doubt about Dumbledore's true character and plan, he sets right a lot of wrongs and god, it's so satisfying! Why we were robbed of that I'll never know.
2. Related, the final ""death blow"" needed to come down to Voldemort's decision to risk using the wand. It's his hubris that finishes him. He had to rise to Harry's final taunt.
3. Because no one is around in the movie version of the standoff, Harry is never celebrated by his victorious peers! Tragic.
4. Similarly, the headmasters standing ovation (which brought me to tears in the book) was completely omitted. You forget that Dumbledore lives on in the framed portrait in that office, which makes everything just so much better.There are other things that bugged me, like, I wanted more time in the pensieve with Snape's memories. What we got from Alan Rickman was so brilliant. Also, the Nagini chase was way too drawn out. But overall, it's those 4 points made above that rob this grande finale of its grandeur.Man. The source material is what sold all those billions of copies and made the series worth being made into movies in the first place. How I wish the filmmakers would have resisted the urge to reinterpret those crucial final moments.Maybe in another 20 years some new director will start the whole thing over again and this time, stick the landing.I'll be waiting."
"This will maybe be a positive for many people but for my taste there was far too much of the never ending action scenes in this movie that otherwise had a great storyline they could have been better developing and focusing on. The action scenes were almost bad enough for ne to go down to 6 stars. If you've ever gotten a headache from visual stimuli, beware of this chaos."
"Best Harry Potter film for me and wonderful end of beautiful journey. The battles are great and tensions are high. Severus Snape is the bravest man and it is one of the best plot twists of all time because we all thought he was evil.Fantastic Beasts doesn't come close to this.
P.s. Very emotional part was when he named his son Albus Severus Potter and told him that he is named after 2 greates wizards and one of them was in Slytherin (I'm not crying, I'm nottt)."
"""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2"" is my favorite HP movie ever! The fact that everything the previous films set up comes to a conclusion and that the film is also not burdened by setting future films makes this great! Also, it has the best story, acting, visual effects, storytelling, and twists, particularly that of Snape's past. If one rewatches the entire series with knowledge of Snape's past, Rickman's performance makes a lot of sense. (ALAN RICKMAN IS GREAT HERE!) Lastly, this is also the movie that made me realize that, aside from Bonnie Wright as Ginny, every actor was perfectly cast!DEAR WARNER BROS., HAYDEY FILMS, HP FILMS PRODUCERS, ACTORS, J.K. AND EVERYONE INVOLVED IN THE MAKING OF THIS SERIES.I love all of you. You made a great film series. Thank you for the adventures. PLEASE ADAPT ""THE CURSED CHILD."""
"Thrilling, powerfully acted, and visually dazzling, Deathly Hallows Part II brings the Harry Potter franchise to a satisfying -- and suitably magical -- conclusion"
