"Nowadays we keep forgetting how beautiful blockbusters can be. Too much CGI makes everything possible and therefore very often also arbitrary. In Raiders you actually seem to feel the physical pain some of the actors/stuntmen had to go through to provide 2 hours of pure entertainment.Of course the story isn't waterproof, the Nazi weren't that present in Egypt in 1936 and how did Indy survive that ride on the submarine again? But lots of good and variable action scenes are accompanied by a story that develops fast and excitingly and is always close to being implausible but luckily never is. Spielberg, Lucas and most of all Harrison Ford created a hero that is nowadays iconic. With their attempt to make an homage to adventure comics of the 1930's they created their own legend. It's funny, exiting, thrilling and romantic. What more can you ask for?"
"I remember seeing this movie when I was young, and it may well have been in the cinema with my Father, I can't quite remember (if he does, then please post the answer), anyway I do remember seeing it and being thoroughly entertained and that feeling of excitement and total fun staying with me to this very day as that is the feeling that the movie conjures up whenever I think of it.I think a part of that is down to the fact it's a complete retake on the old serial movies combined with obvious comic book style, and that is just perfect for kids and appeals to them no end, or rather it did then! So it was with excitement that I opened my presents on my birthday and found the boxset for the Indiana Jones Trilogy, and with even more excitement when I finally watched the first in the trilogy, Raiders of the lost Ark.It was just as I remembered, fun, excitement, wise cracks, a tiny splattering of romance but with a manliness that kids would allow, and lots of stunts and action. It's a superb movie and captures that style of serials, adventure stories and comic books perfectly, how I know that for sure is only through repeats since I wasn't alive during those times.The set pieces are fantastic, and although some of the wilder end sequences are slightly dated now, it hasn't lost the excitement factor. It's a perfectly crafted movie as well, moving from location to location without any distraction or superfluous scenes, it just feels like it's all there for a reason and that it belongs there.Harrison Ford is excellent in the role, and I'm inclined to think he was more Indy than he was Solo, but that's a personal opinion. He has many more facial movements and voice inclinations in this early movie than he does nowadays, now he belongs to the moody, quiet school of acting, then he was dynamic, adventurous, strong and as wisecracking as the best of them.There are some excellent movie making moments in this with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg showing talent galore just oozing out of every pore (where did all that go for Star Wars I to III Mr Lucas?), and they end up making an excellently entertaining movie.Some could argue that there could be a bit more depth or seriousness to the story, but come on, it's a ripping adventure yarn, you don't need depth. Saving the Ark from the Nazi's, surely that's enough! An excellent movie and great fun too, without a doubt one of my favourite of all time."
"It is a hot sunny day in South America. We see a bunch of men, shot mostly from the back. They are walking deep into the forest. We see a tall dark figure. He is wearing an old leather jacket, he has the 5 o'clock shadow looking like it's closer to midnight, he wears a fedora and he carries a bull-whip ( yes a bull-whip ). Finally, two of the men enter a cave and we hear about some guy named Forstall, who was good, very, very good, but he never came out of the place alive. But they enter anyway. They are confronted with tarantulas, spears that are triggered by blocking out the light, a pit that they must swing over and then more tiny poisonous darts that come out of the wall. All this to protect an ancient gold statue. They recover it. One guy dies and the other barely makes it out of the room before it all falls on him. Then he has to get out of the cave and a giant boulder chases him. Finally he makes it out of the cave only to be surrounded by Hovitos and his arch enemy named Belloq. He takes the gold statue that this guy worked so hard for and then the guy runs and makes it to the plane where he is in the passenger seat and there is big snake in the plane. He hates snakes. This mans name? Indiana Jones!Whhhoooooo!! I'm left breathless just describing that opening. But is there a better beginning of a movie ever? Absolutely not. Does the beginning have anything to do with the rest of the film. No. It is all decoration for what the movie is going to put you through in the 90 minutes to come.Indiana Jones is the best character to ever hit the screens. And he better be. He is created by George, Steven and played by Harrison Ford. That may seem normal now that we have lived with him for 20 years, but can you imagine what that must have been like back in 1981. That would be like Tom Hanks or Will Smith joining forces with James Cameron and Steven Spielberg for a completely original idea in today's terms.Raiders took a simple idea and maybe an idea that the guys had from watching Saturday afternoon movies and made it larger than life. This film never stops for you to take your breath. It is filled with rich characters from Indy himself to Marion to Belloq and even to Marcus Brody. Each has their own personality that shines through in certain scenes. Some of my faves were when we first meet Marion having a shot contest in her bar in Nepal. Then there is her scene with Belloq and they get drunk together and she tries to leave using only a butter knife. And of course who can forget Indy's battle with the swordsman and his unrivaled determination to get the ark. "" Indy, there is not time. If you still want the truck it is being loaded on a truck for Cairo. "" ( a battered and bloody Indy ) "" Truck? What truck?"" ( and then later ) ""Get some transport back to England, boat, plane, anything. Meet me at Omar's. I'm going after that truck. ""Sola ) "" How? "" ( Indy ) I don't know I'm making this up as I go.""Raiders has more energy than three action films. And that is what makes it the classic that it is. If you like movies, then Raiders is a movie that will not let you down. It is pure entertainment and that is indisputable. It finds the youngster in all of us and bombards us with this silly, whip-cracking, average, incredibly determined archaeologist and only asks us to have fun. And that we do. And to me, the only reason that Chariots of Fire won best picture that year is because it is a serious film. Raiders was heads and shoulders above Chariots and it should have cleaned up at the Oscars in 81. But more politics with the academy.Raiders of the Lost Ark is the epitome of entertainment. What more can be said about it. If you haven't seen this movie in a while or if you haven't seen it at all ( gasp ) then do yourself a favour and rent it tonight. It is awesome.TRUST ME"
"This movie has everything: action, a good cast, humor, a wonderful soundtrack (John Williams) a good pace and a good script. I watch this movie like 2 or 3 times a year and it still fascinates me. Thank you for this masterpiece mr. Spielberg! They don't make movies like this anymore!"
"If you've seen this movie and heard the score, then my one line summary won't read like a mating call for sheep, but rather the absolutely exhilarating ""Raider's March"" which stirs my blood and makes me think of an unforgettable hero, Indiana Jones. If not, see it now.I love going to movies. I always have. I remember when this film came out. My friends had seen it before I had. They boasted it was great, the best film ever. Some even said it was better than Star Wars (utter blasphemy to a devout 10 year old Jedi-wannabe). I thought no way is this film better than Star Wars, but I was still curious and began the begging of my father to take me.When I was young, almost all of the films that I had seen, I saw with my Dad. He would take me and my mother would stay at home with my siblings. We saw a number of films that failed to generate a reaction with him as they did with me, but this one was different. This one, my Dad might've enjoyed just as much.Who can forget the scene where Indy faces bandits in the marketplace, fighting swords with his wits and fists, only to be finally challenged by a dark robed adversary brandishing a heavy, dismembering type of sabre as he swings the impressive blade about his head menacingly?Indiana looks his opponent up and down briefly and draws his pistol casually and shoots the villain dead as if his patience had been tested a moment longer than he could tolerate.My father, and the entire audience for that matter, laughed and cheered at this incredible scene. And it was the first time I'd actually been aware of his enjoyment of the film. Usually I'm so transfixed that I wouldn't notice if my legs were on fire. He enjoyed it so much, that he still tends to bring up that scene, even today.My father and I shared a great moment in movie history, and I will never forget it for as long as I live. I will always be grateful for the time we spent together and the films that I otherwise would have been unable to see without him taking me.Just a side note about the scene I've described above. It wasn't meant to go that  way at all. As Steven Spielberg explained in a television interview, the scene was meant to have an elaborate fight sequence, but Harrison Ford was suffering from diarrhea and couldn't go through with the elaborate set-up required. Someone said, ""the only way we can finish this scene today is if he shoots him"". Steven said, ""Wait a minute, we might have something there.""As for where it ranks with Star Wars, it's hard for me to say, so I won't. Star Wars was the first film I ever saw, and there's a story in that as well. Thanks again, Dad."
"I've seen Raiders of the Lost Ark numerous times on TV, DVD and big screen. My local theatre had a special showing last night and the 400-seat screen completely sold out (as Indy films always do). Luckily for me and my pal, we got the last 2 tickets available! I can't think of many films that still sell-out 25 years after their original release. There's just something about Indy movies(iconic hero, affection, epic spectacle) that brings you back again and again.The only trouble with that is there are zillions of reviews, critiques and dissections of this movie already out there, so what I have to offer will probably not be anything new. I will however not go the way of the cliché and mention 1930's serials, Tom Selleck or the sword/gun fight.I will, however, ask you one question. Did you know that some of the more iconic, memorable sequences from Raiders owe quite a lot to Duck Tales? What? Surely it's the other way around? Well, no. The globe-trotting adventures of Scrooge McDuck, Huey, Duey, Luey and Donald in Carl Bank's Disney comic-books from the 50s came first. If you can find some of these then you'll surely notice the similarities.The hunt for the Ark of the Covenant is more than just an excuse for action. So many movies these days seem to come up with action first and string them together with some lame plot. Movies like this are quickly forgotten and one of the reasons Raiders holds up so well is because it works the Covenant story so well into the plot.The action comes in a succession of set-pieces. I do enjoy films that have to increasingly better themselves in every scene. Raiders introduced this as a standard that the sequels had to live up to. My fave scene has to be the massive truck chase through Egypt, which is made up of many of its own smaller sequences. One little idiosyncrasy I like about Indy is that even though he's a College Professor and Doctor, he has no beef killing people. So very far from the ubiquitous PC heroes of todays movies.You might think that it's rather geeky to hype up the editing and sound design, but they do stand out from recent action movies. The gunfire and punching seem to have a sort of 'Indy' signature sound to them, that I've not heard in any other films. And obviously, John William's classic score is one of those themes that just everybody in the world knows (though I prefer his score to Temple of Doom), truly one of the best movie themes ever. Better than Star Wars! I'm not sure if Spielberg planned on Raiders starting the Indy franchise but there's already enough in here to establish a whole universe of potential stories and character arcs. There's talk of a fourth movie at the moment, but I personally don't think it will happen and I don't want it to. It's perfect existing as a trilogy and a sequel that comes traipsing in 18 years after the last is just not going to feel right. Even if you are hungry for more Indy then there are loads of books and video games out there and then there's the Young Indiana Jones TV show (where are the DVDs?), which are official Indy canon and even starred Ford once (they bounced around in time).I am giving Raiders 9/10 because I just have a soft spot for Temple of Doom (which is obviously a 10/10 movie). Even 25 years after it first came out it still has the power to captivate the audience and provoke sheer excitement every time. And in 25 years it will still be far superior to almost everything.Now there's something you cannot say about The Fast and the Furious! Sigh, where did all the special movies go?"
"Ford stars as Indiana Jones, an archaeologist adventurer, who spends his time traveling all over the world through jungles, deserts, oceans, and caverns in search for hidden treasureslike the priceless long-lost Ark of the Covenant (the Hebrew sacred artifact that held the supposed Ten Commandments). Unfortunately, a group of treasure-hungry Nazis wants it too, having heard that any army who wins it would receive supernatural powers With his trademark hat, whip, leather jacket, and pistol for backup, our stubborn, intelligent, determined and loyal hero escapes innumerable dangers, evades multiple obstacles including fearsome thugs in a busy Cairo bazaar, and hangs underneath a fast-moving truck in an exciting chase through a road These are only some of the film's incredible set pieces Steven Spielberg likable hero is not invincible, though, facing impossible odds, capable of getting beaten, struck violently, heart broken, and falling asleep after the first kiss The villainsespecially Indy's suave and cultured French rival wearing a Panama hat and white suits, Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman)are not really that much different from him, except in their motivation The shrill heroine, Marion (Karen Allen)is not the girl always in discomfort either, but a resourceful, dynamic and formidable woman who doesn't require the hero at all ""Raiders of the Lost Arc"" is a perfect package of unforgettable scenes, countless action, humor, astonishing technical effects, thrilling sequences, and terrific performances It was followed by three fun sequels"
"This film had a huge impact on my life. It (as well as Aliens) really introduced me to the films I love. The 80s and 90s were amazing for film while I was growing up. I love all the practical effects and wish they were still used a lot more than they are but cgi has taken over. Oh well. At least it has improved drastically over the years. Anyway, I feel like everyone should see this in their life and if you haven't....get on it"
"Original, exciting, and lots of fun. Spielberg directed it and Kasdan and Lucas wrote it. Without it, we wouldn't have had ""Romancing the Stone"", ""The Jewel of the Nile,"" ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Empire"", and many others too numerous to list. They were all more or less rip offs of this one. Of course the original was highly successful. I dragged my lugubrious ex to the theater and even SHE enjoyed it. For a while there was an attempt to merchandise Indiana Jones' leather jackets, fedoras, and bull whips but they didn't get far.The fact that this was such a commercial blockbuster raised the inevitable question, which may be roughly phrased as, ""What do I do NOW, Ma?"" What you do is produce sequels: ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,"" ""Indiana Jones and the Amazon Women of the Moon,"" and so on. Each imitation, each sequel, was less innovative and more desperate and sloppy, but that's in the nature of decadence.Harrison Ford, whose career this put the stamp of approval on, is an archaeologist who is recruited to find the Ark of the Covenant hidden somewhere in the Middle East. It's 1936 and the Nazis are after it and who knows what havoc they might wreak with its powers? Jones drags along Karen Allen, a former lover and assistant, to provide a pulchritudinous sidekick with whom he can exchange insults. Anything resembling sex is out of the question, though, just as it would never have been considered in one of the 1930s Saturday afternoon theater serials on which this kind of story is based.Here's the schematic diagram of the plot: Introduction, suspense, action, suspense, action, suspense . . . n. Then the climax -- a really BIG action scene.But the thing that made it successful and keeps it so enjoyable after thirty years is that the action wasn't of the usual sort. Oh, sure, Jones and his girl friend are threatened with immanent death lots of times -- involved in comic fist fights, shot at with poisoned arrows. That's de rigeur. But how often does a hero find himself dashing through an underground tunnel downhill pursued by a three-ton rolling marble? Another element that contributed to its appeal was its reconstruction of the period, 1936. The exotic settings of 1936 aren't just rebuilt. They're lovingly reproduced. The ordinary set dressings are there to suggest the exotic -- always look for beaded curtains -- but the men don't waltz around in immaculate double-breasted white suits and pith helmets. The settings are overblown, to be sure. I strongly doubt that in all of Nepal there was a saloon with the size and atmosphere of Karen Allen's. I'm not at all sure there were ANY saloons in Nepal in 1936. But they're meant to suggest authenticity, not embody it, and they succeed in an creative way.Finally, the characters are kind of enjoyable in themselves, from the often frightened and only barely willing Indiana Jones himself, through the cartoon Nazis with the monocles and Swastika armbands. Oh, boy, watch the ark of the covenant MELT them down to nothing while they are frozen in place and screaming! The force unleashed."
"There are few movies I can watch over and over again, but this is one of them.  This movie has it all: action, romance, comedy, and suspense. Harrison Ford is at his best as Dr. Jones, one of the most exciting archeologist ever.  From the start to the end you are hooked to this movie. I love the opening when he as to dodge traps as he tries to get this treasure, I love it when he is running through the streets trying to save the girl, I just love every bit of it.  Spielburg said he wanted a b-type movie like he remembered from his youth, but this far surpasses any b movie and any a movie as far as I am concerned."
"There are only so many films in history that I can watch again and again, gaining new appreciation for, one of them is this film. I went from the movies to VHS, and finally to DVD. The availability and quality of this film keep raising the bar of what I can get from it.I read someone posted that this is the king of B movies or something of that sort, while I honestly think in some scenes like when Indy is running from the Hovitos and he rises over the hill, the film had a really strange documentary feeling, like if a comic actually came to life and like in the Twilight Zone, you were stuck in it. It is great to see this film, now that I edit and produce small independent films, and have worked in post production in Los Angeles. I honestly think almost every scene in this film is better than what's coming out today in sci-fi/adventure. I might pull back that comment in regards to some nice visuals in Riddick, and maybe the new Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith, but I'm not certain.The amount of time and effort put into the comedy, adventure, and depth of each character dazzles me because I really can't tell it was filmed the same year Fame was. It really has a unique look to it. The key lighting in the piece is amazing, almost everything looks like it was perfectly worked out.My only complaint is the attempt to visualize the opening of the Ark, as most of the other scenes don't deal with the supernatural except maybe a burning crate with a nazi symbol on it. George should redo that last scene in my opinion, and tighten it up, because I really think it wasn't coming together, however when I was a child it was so amazing and scary realistic. It's all perspective, but my point it that now in this modern filming era, the acting and film production is holding tight to this day.I forward you to just enjoy this film and look for things like formulas on chalkboards, skeletons in classrooms, proper patches on Nazi gear, gun accuracy. Research the film's era and background, and it only gets better. That's the ability that Spielberg and Lucas have, attention to detail and clever twists on most of their bodies of work.Watch this film again, it's worth it, I promise you."
"The Indiana Jones series was the best series ever made, in my opinion. It was extremely fun and enjoyable to watch and it can be watched repeatedly, with no lesser joy. Harrison Ford as Indy is extremely charismatic, like Han Solo, but the character of Indiana for me has an essence that creates a more likable character (modesty, I think) and by doing that, it creates a better trilogy for me, indeed surpassing the Original Star Wars Tilogy (don't get me wrong I love Star Wars as well).Raiders is such a great film, containing some great action scenes (the Truck scene) and creating Indiana Jones, which is the best adventure hero ever made, partly I think due to Harrison Ford (I don't think these movies would have been as good with Tom Selleck)."
"Rating: **** out of ****There is no doubt in my mind that Indiana Jones is the best movie series in the history of cinema. And the one start it all was Raiders of the Lost Ark, a fast-paced adventure packed with one death-defying cliff-hanger situation after another. To this day, Raiders remains one of the best action movies, holding up better than most of today's rapid-cut, MTV-style ""thrill rides."" Raiders relied on no CGI, no flashy editing, just pure, exhilarating film-making and storytelling, a combo of its kind that has only been surpassed by its second sequel, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.Harrison Ford stars as Jones, an archaeologist who dresses in a brown coat and fedora, armed with a revolver and lion-taming whip. A delightful opening involving elaborate booby traps informs us he's used to these adventures (especially his even closer brushes with death in Temple of Doom, which was a prequel). When he returns to the states from his latest ""excavation,"" he's informed by the military that the Nazis are after the ark of the covenant, an artifact that could possess the power to make the Nazis an invincible army. So Jones sets out to retrieve the ark first, in what will prove to be one of his greatest adventures.There's probably little doubt that Raiders is the fan/critical favorite of the trilogy, but there are a few things that I actually have to gripe about, blasphemous as it may be. For one, even though the story is excellent, it's not without its holes. Most perplexing is in the film's opening scenes, when we wonder why Jones bothered to bring along potentially traitorous porters when it's such a short distance from the river to the cave temple. Also (spoilers), one needs only to see the film once to realize that if Indy had never tried to intercept the Ark, the Nazis would a) have never found it or b) still would have suffered the same horrible fate regardless.The action sequences are superb, though an early bar shootout isn't quite as adrenaline-pumping as it could be and looks quite bland compared to the film's other action scenes. Thankfully, the following street chase is playful and exciting and keeps the joyous momentum flowing. Overall, I'd still argue that both Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade boast more inventive action but there's no questioning that the action scenes in Raiders are fantastic and likely superior to any film you may have seen the last few years.As bitchy as I may sound, I'm not trying to harp on Raiders, at least not too much. The movie does feature the famous (and deservedly so) truck chase, one of the most unbelievably thrilling and exhilarating action setpieces I've ever seen (and given an extra boost by John Williams' beautifully rousing score). To this day, even with the recent chase scenes in The Matrix Reloaded and Terminator 3, this sequence has yet to be surpassed.Other standout sequences include a sarcophagus almost entirely decorated with snakes, imposing statues, and well-preserved mummies, and Jones' mano-a-mano battle with a seemingly impervious Nazi mechanic. The finale takes the film dangerously close to the horror genre, climaxing things with a truly memorable (and quite frightening) light show for the ages. Every Indiana Jones film has a scene that scarred me as a kid and I think every one who's seen Raiders knows what I'm referring to (as well as its sequels)I've said it before, Harrison Ford is wonderful as Jones, embodying a hero that's cool beyond words, yet still entirely human and believable. The supporting cast isn't as up to par: Paul Freeman makes for a decent but not particularly menacing villain as Belloq and Karen Allen is somewhat annoying as Indy's love interest, but there are an equal share in gems, particularly Denholm Elliot as Marcus Brody and John Rhys-Davies as Sallah (The Last Crusade wisely gave these actors/characters more screen time).Raiders of the Lost Ark was revolutionary cinema, paving way for summer blockbusters that would attempt for the same winning mix of thrills and humor. Only its sequels matched and/or surpassed it, but some have actually come close (The Mummy). If you haven't seen Raiders yet, put it on the top of your list."
"It's great. It's amazing. It's well-made. It's exciting. It's a movie I can watch countless times and never get bored of it (I have seen it several hundred times but can't count how many exactly). Simply, it's the quintessential action movie! One with a amazing story, super-cool hero, great bad guys, and awesome settings. There's not much else to be said...just watch it!"
"What can I possibly add to what has already been written? This film is a ""masterpiece"". It's placed in quotations because that word is bandied about on here for films that aren't fit to lace this movies' boots. This movie should be preserved for all eternity as a template on how to make an incredibly entertaining and wonderful film, and as I said earlier, there isn't much I can add to what has already been said about Raiders. Let's just say that there are only so many films I plan on introducing to my children when they get old enough and this film is amongst that list.
Harrison Ford was amazing in the titular role, and the supporting cast added immense scale and brevity to the work HF was doing as Indy.
Spielberg and Lucas created a character and movie for the ages.Keep an eye out for one of the most iconic film sequences of all time as well!Make sure that you give this film the rating and love it deserves. Thank you for reading!"
"Raiders of the Lost Ark, the first of the Indiana Jones trilogy and definitely the best. This movie redefined what an action adventure movie could and should be. After the epic Horror Adventure that is Jaws comes the epic action adventure, Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark. This movie easily deserves 10 stars for it's sheer innovation, directing, visuals, and entertainment ability. Here's why. Harrison Ford is a perfect choice for the awesome hero, Indiana Jones. An archaeologist who dreams of fortune and glory, he embarks on an adventure to find the Ark of the Covanent and save it from the Nazis. Harrison Ford is perfect in this role and it's so refreshing to see a badass hero that everybody can root for simply because he's awesome and embodies everything we want from an adventurer. Every moment of him is simply cinematic gold and it makes him shine against everyone else, even himself as Han Solo. That's not to say that the supporting actors aren't great, they are, but he's the main character and he steals the show which he should. Steven Spielberg really went out of his way with this masterpiece. The practical effects and stuntwork isn't just phenomenal, it's almost godlike! The action is jaw dropping in its awesomeness to the point where it almost doesn't even look like a movie, it looks like a portal into somebody else's universe: Spielberg's universe. What visual effects that are used are so good that it makes modern day action flicks look like stupid college projects that got F's. Michael Bay ain't got nothing on Golden Age Spielberg! Every scene screams with action and it just gets better and better all the way through but it never forsakes the story in place of action. Modern day directors need to take notes from this movie. Once somebody watches this movie, you soon find yourself in a trance in which you can never get sick of it. Nobody can get sick of Indiana Jones, it's not possible. Go watch this movie and you will be very pleased. Or just listen to the Golden John Williams music, that works too."
"I understand that I may be forgiven for not thinking 'Citizen Kane' is so great, but the following is cinematic heresy- I've decided I'm not that crazy about the Indiana Jones series. They're fun films, no doubt, and there are certainly worse ways to spend a couple of hours. I watched 'The Last Crusade' again not long ago, and last night I watched the first one. At the risk of stating the obvious, what 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' really has going for it is Harrison Ford and a couple of slam-bang action/special effects sequences. Well, you say, for cryin' out loud, isn't that enough? And yeah, I suppose it is. I've just found I'm not nearly as enamored of the series as I once thought I was, and each of the films has flaws that perhaps only become apparent on repeated viewings. The aspect of 'Raiders' that grates particularly each time I see it is Karen Allen's performance. I'm sorry, I don't find her funny or attractive or even interesting. I understand that the idea is for her to be a feisty tomboy, someone who speaks her mind and is ""more than a match"" (as they say) for Ford's Indy. But does that mean Allen's Marion has to be so utterly unattractive, in every sense? At times, she seems more like a gangly, socially-challenged thirteen-year-old who hasn't learned basic table manners yet and who snorts when she laughs. I don't know what's more annoying, her behavior or the fact that every male in the film seems to think she's gorgeous. Granted, she doesn't have any competition... that must be it. So there's that. The film of course was a trendsetter in many ways, resurrecting almost single-handedly the grand old adventure flick. The durable plot elements and (other) characters were made to seem fresh again, from the resourceful adventurer venturing to exotic lands to those most reliably evil of slimy villains, the Nazis. And there is a toughness to the first Indiana Jones movie that seems somewhat lacking in the other two. Both Sallah and Marcus Brody are real characters here, alternately serious and amusing. By the time we get to 'Last Crusade,' the two men are strictly comic relief, and Marcus in particular becomes a scatterbrained buffoon. The climax of 'Raiders,' when it finally comes, was something of a revelation (so to speak) at the time. This was the big payoff, and it didn't disappoint, though it's actually pretty brief. The face-melting and vaporous spirits (to be used to a much greater extent later in Spielberg's 'Poltergeist') had audiences wide-eyed with amazement. And then a clever little epilogue left cinema-goers feeling satisfied, that they'd really gotten their money's worth. I shared all those feelings when I first saw 'Raiders of the Lost Ark;' as I said, it's only been the last two or three times I've watched it that I haven't been as blown away."
"This movie is just about perfect in every way. Simple, but true."
"This adventure flick, which mixes the Western movie formula and special effects in their infant days, represents the American mainstream cinema in the early 80s in many ways. The protagonist Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is a scholar and an action hero; this combination is unique but the uniqueness has nothing to do with the character development and seems to be the result of the filmmakers' thoughtless decision. The portrayal of the heroine Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) is also inconsistent; sometimes she is tough and independent, while frail and dependent on Indiana Jones in the other times. Along with a dragging optimistic story, overly stretched action scenes may be beyond the audience's attention span. The Reaganomix overshadows the plot, where the Americans can do whatever they want in foreign places (South America, Nepal, and Cairo). The sets of Nepal and Cairo look nothing but sets, while John Williams' score, with a catchy melody line by brilliant brass in the Late Romanticism taste, annoyingly accentuates every single action."
"This film, starring Harrison Ford and Karen Allen is a decent action film for its time. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is an archaeologist and a teacher at a college in the U.S. and besides teaching, he is on the hunt for the staff of Ra to get the lost ark. He isn't alone in trying to get the ark, however, because a group of Nazis are looking to obtain the ark to control God. The special effects are good for the time, however, to anyone watching this movie now would think they are cheesy and fake. The plot is very good and keeps you watching, but I feel that some of the escapes Indiana Jones makes isn't really realistic at all. All in all this movie is good, but you have to keep in mind that it was made many years ago."
"At the time this movie was first released, I saw a lot of movies. I pretty much saw every new release as it came out.So, I went to see Caveman (was I the only one who saw Caveman?) and it was billed with a Sneak Preview. The Sneak Preview was unnamed. If you can believe it, I sat through Caveman and made it to the Sneak Preview. I am glad I did. Raiders of the Lost Ark was the Sneak Preview and I was able to view the film before anyone even knew about it. It is a great movie with tons or drama, action, special effects and even Nazis. This movie has everything. It is a real treat."

For having just a PG-13 rating - I was completely taken by surprise by all of the violence, gore and bloodshed that prevailed in this top-notch Action/Adventure film from 1981.Featuring a first-rate, adrenaline-rush, opening sequence - ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" certainly delivered plenty of awesome, over-the-top stunts, as well as some good touches of cynical humour (thrown in for good measure) that kept all of the action moving along at near break-neck speed, throughout.My 2 favourite characters in this fast-paced action picture were - (1) Dr. Rene Belloq, the utterly ruthless villain, and Nazi-collaborator, played so wickedly nasty by actor Paul Freeman - And, of course - (2) Indiana Jones, our archaeologist-hero (sans super-powers), played very tongue-in-cheek by Harrison Ford.My biggest complaint here has to do with the unwelcome introduction of the Marion Ravenwood character into the story. To me, her presence in the action only served to interfere and undermine Indiana Jones's heroic quest to uncover the legendary ""Ark of the Covenant"" before the evil Nazis did."
"Most people give this movie a 10 out of 10 because they don't consider the movie but rather how happy they were to discover it as a child but now, in 2005, it has become obviously outdated, the script is quite bad and the acting is even worse. Harrisson Ford obviously should have worked his acting better, which he happily did since that movie. I am sorry I cannot just keep on lying about this movie: this is for your kids but in now way should it be put among masterpieces. IMDb is a web site about movies, not about cult and self-proclaimed nerds or geeks. You have to determine how good is a movie according to artistical criteria, neither to your gregarious instinct nor to your ""attitude""."
"Everyone else seems to love this movie, so I guess I have to be the one to 'dis' it.  I really don't understand why it is so popular.   I really enjoy a good adventure, but I like it to be more than a quarter inch deep.It was so continuously noisy that I had to turn the volume down.   The music was bombastic and grating.  People die like flies.  The protagonists gaily wreak havoc with no apologies.  There is no psychology or character.  The hero is brave - a cheap virtue since he's obviously invulnerable.   The cultural icons dragged in to lend an exotic tone were given the most superficial treatment - everything was a throwaway, but none of it was stylish, witty or funny.  We are talking about a cartoon - except lots of cartoons are more sophisticated and better developed.I can see that the idea is to evoke a golden age of imperialism where we are excused from the duty to care about history, culture and religion, or to feel bad about archaeological piracy, mass murder, ethnic stereotypes, shoddy scholarship, etc. etc. and can just have some good clean fun.  But with all this freedom, what is the fun?   Knocking over piles of blocks like a three-year-old and punching the bad guy in the nose.The movie is a pastiche - almost every scene is borrowed.  The cultural vein of nostalgia that is being mined is old -obsolete - adventure fiction. If we could see most of this fiction now we would probably find it childish and dated - we know more about the world now.  The trick is to make us forget that so we can enjoy our nostalgia.Do people really need permission to regress this badly?"
"In the run up to WW2 Professor Jones is approached by US Intelligence to recover the lost Ark of the Covenant in order to stop it falling into the hands of the Nazi's.  With bar owner Marion in tow, Indiana takes on Nazi's across the globe to recover the ark.The story is pure Saturday morning hokum, but its all shined up with a great deal of professionalism and you don't notice.  The main strength is the tremendous sense of fun in the film - not only is it funny but the huge action scenes are all edge of the seat stuff that are hugely enjoyable to watch.  Be it the opening set piece, the truck chase, the fight around a burning airplane, the chase for a basket or the gory finish - it's all great fun to watch.The performances are pretty cardboard and stereotype - evil Nazi's et al. but it barely matters.  Ford is great - this is the type of undemanding hero type that he thrives on.  The rest of the cast are good - Freeman and Kahler stand out with their characters.  If it has any weaknesses then the lack of characterisation and plotting are the main suspects but I really think the flaws are greatly outweighed by strengths.Overall a good action film for older families.  With an old fashioned feel, a great sense of fun, plenty of laughs and fantastic action scenes this deserves all the good reviews it gets."
"There are so many ways in which this film is perfect, most notably is the brilliant re-packaging of old-school action and war films; away from the James-Bond style of the late 60s; away from the Cold-War suspense and intrigue. One of the most endearing features of the picture is that the movie opens with the main character,Indiana Jones' at the close of his current adventure. The technique generates an immediate sense of personal history and intimacy with the main character, and in effect, serves the audience dessert twice.The atmosphere of equal parts impending danger and chronic screw ups is set right from the start, with a lit-fuse pace throughout the movie. Every scene is tight. The sound, the lighting, the dialog,the music, the performances. Every character actor is well-chosen. So many ingredients to enjoy: adventure, humor, mysterious locations, romance, explosions. Only a Nazi could not enjoy this film!"
"Raiders of the Lost Ark is an action masterpiece. There's not one bit of fat on its bones. There's not one wasted moment. It flows exactly like an adventure movie should  it continually moves forward, breathlessly driving you towards the conclusion; it's incredible fun.The reason why the film works so well is because the script is so tight. The exposition is clear and well delivered, meaning that you know precisely what's at stake, small character details are set up early on and paid off later and the dialogue is incredibly pithy. It's a masterclass in film writing.However, this would mean nothing if all the other elements didn't come together. Thankfully they do. Spielberg's direction is superb, Harrison Ford is perfect as the hero, Karen Allen is wonderful as the heroine and the music is out of this world. Plus the action is kick ass. My favourite action scene is the fight with Pat Roach by the plane. Quite unusually for a film hero, Indy doesn't mind fighting dirty. He kicks Roach in the balls, he throws sand in his face and he even bites him. Indy doesn't have to win a fight fairly. And it's also unusual for a film hero to be so vulnerable. We rarely see anyone get a scratch or put in any real jeopardy. But here Indy gets his arse handed to him. The only reason he survives is because he's so wily  after getting beaten and bruised for a while he leads Roach into getting chopped up by the plane's rotor blades.My second favourite action sequence is when Indy chases after the Ark and recovers it by hijacking a Nazi truck. After the CGI mess of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, it's great to see old-fashioned stunts. It's a much better way of letting you get absorbed by the action  even though you know it's a film, you know someone actually had to do this, making everything much more impressive to watch. The best stunt is when Indy is thrown through the front window and has to pull himself along the bottom of the truck. He manages to do this and then hooks his whip under the bottom so that he's dragged along the ground. He then manages to get back on the truck and back in the cabin. It's a joy to behold and allows you to immerse yourself in the action. Another great thing about the sequence is that once again we're shown Indy's vulnerability. As he's driving he gets shot in the arm. And then later a guy punches him in his injured arm and throws him out of the truck. Therefore when Indy comes back and beats the crap out of this guy, it's doubly satisfying, because not only is the guy a damn Nazi, but he also had the audacity to try and injure our hero. And the blood and guts reminds me of how gritty the film is. Not only do we have Indy getting shot in the arm and then having the wound beaten, but earlier on a guy gets shot in the face  lots of blood pours down from the hole in his skull. Oh, and he's also on fire. Excellent. But as well as this there's also stuff that is just plain over the top. The melting faces for instance and Belloq's head exploding. This scared the hell out of me as a kid and I'm still amazed that stuff like this was included in a 'kids' film.However, the scene that terrified me the most as a kid was the scene where Marion gets mugged by skeletons and we then see a large snake oozing from a skull's mouth. I was so traumatised I refused to watch the film for years. But now the vague horror element is another reason I adore the movie. It sets it apart from almost every action/adventure film that came before it and nothing else has managed to better it, even subsequent Indiana Jones films. But watching the film now it's quite unusual to note that Indy doesn't kill any of the three main villains. They're all killed by the Ark. Indy instead just closes his eyes and lets 'god' do the rest. It's a strange ending but one that works perfectly. Indy isn't a killing machine. He's someone trying to do the right thing. And at the end he's rewarded by, well, not having his face melted off.Another reason why Raiders stands out is because of its heroine. She's one of the best in modern cinema  a tough woman who constantly shows her toughness without having to resort to ridiculous feats of physicality. We don't see her pummel men who are twice her size, but we do see her out smart them and drink them under the table. As well as this she has great chemistry with Indy. For instance, there's the marvellous scene where she tries to look after our injured hero and he cries like a girl every time she touches him. He then points out a few places where it doesn't hurt, which she kisses. It's a lovely scene. And I also like the bit of slapstick humour earlier where Indy gets a mirror smashed in his face when Marion turns it over. This leads me to another reason why Raiders is brilliant. It's very funny. You have a monkey giving a Nazi salute, Indy nonchalantly shooting a swordsman, Sallah's cowardly reactions at the Well of Souls and the Gestapo man plunging his hand in the snow after he gets it burnt while trying to grab an extremely hot bronze medallion. The humour is great.And on top of all of this cinematic goodness  the humour, the action, the adventure  you have one of the best opening sequences in film. It's a bravura piece of film-making  everything clicks perfectly."
"Indiana Jones is the best movie character of all time. He has a whip, a revolver, a fedora, charismatic, looks like young Harrison Ford, has a leather jacket, AND fights Nazis? Wow"
"Steven Spielberg is back, better than ever! After the dismal failure that was 1941, the acclaimed director teamed up with George Lucas, coming off his Star Wars fame to create one of the most memorable heroes of all time. Raiders of the Lost Ark is my favorite movie from 1981 and is in my top 20 films of all time. This movie gives everything you could ask for. Strong, memorable characters, witty dialogue, fantastic set pieces, exotic locations, great action, and a John Williams musical theme you could never forget. Indiana Jones is my favorite fictional hero and this movie is the example why I believe that.This movie has fascinating origins. George Lucas was writing this movie the same time he came up with the idea for Star Wars. He decided to pursue his space adventure instead to great success. In 1978, while on vacation in Hawaii, he ran into Steven Spielberg, who was coming off Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Spielberg expressed his idea of creating a James Bond movie. Lucas showed him his character, which was named Indiana Smith at first, thus creating a collaboration which would lead to this movie and two sequels and a prequel. The film also takes influence from the works of Edgar Burroughs Rice, 1930's serials, and a 1950's comic about a globe-trotting duck named Scrooge McDuck.This movie really has it all. With Spielberg and Lucas at the head, screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan joined the project to help polish the script. Together they created memorable heroes in Indiana Jones, an archaeology professor who travels the world to protect or find ancient artifacts and his former girlfriend Marion who is strong female character who is able to protect herself. For villains, we have the horrible Nazis, drunken Sherpas, Frenchmen making alliances with the Nazis, and Jones's favorite animal, snakes! He hates snakes! For locations: we have the sands of Egypt, abandoned submarine bases, the jungles of Peru, the mountains of Tibet, and so forth. If you want a travelling experience from your own living room, look no further than this movie.I was impressed with the plot. The plot is simple and really is a framework for all the impressive action scenes and stunts there are. But in the end, everything is coherent and makes plenty sense. It is the year 1936. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) learns from his good friend, Brody (Denholm Elliot) that the Nazis are searching for the Ark of the Covenant, a golden casket that was used to house the Ten Commandments. It has also been known that this arc is able to give power to those who wield it. Jones's mission? To reach the Ark before the Nazis do. He goes to Tibet to pick up Marion (Karen Allen) who has a medallion that has a secret to the location of the Ark. Together, they head to that location where they will try to beat the Nazis-and scheming Frenchmen at their own game.The performances are all excellent. What is funny that when Spielberg/Lucas did the casting, Spielberg wanted Harrison Ford from the get-go, but Lucas was against his casting because he did not want Ford to be is ""Bobby De Niro"" which is in reference to Martin Scorsese always casting Robert De Niro in his films. In retrospect, I do not think anyone could have pulled this role off like Harrison Ford did. Ford was brilliant and created a memorable character with his iconic performance. He is kind and intelligent character, but he can be ruthless at times. However, he is charming. Charm may be the one word that can describe Indiana Jones. I really dug Karen Allen's performance. A strong-willed character with the ability to protect herself. I liked the villainous performances from the slimy Nazis. Paul Freeman as Dr. Rene Belloq as the scheming Frenchman who happens to be Jones's rival, and Ronald Lacey as the incredibly slimy Nazi, Toht.Even in today's cinematic world, the visual effects and the action sequences stand out. I honestly cannot say what I liked the most since everything was so well-done! The opening sequence set forth what to expect in this movie. That boulder chasing Jones is an amazing sequence. That chase scene is great as well, and it makes good use of an old, classic joke! Another sequence that stood out to me is when Jones and Marion are holding on to dear life in the pit of snakes. That was a scene that let you feel real horror. And don't get me started on the face-melting sequences! I am still in awe what the special effects team did with this film.Raiders of the Lost Ark is a true classic that spawned a franchise that is still going strong today. Adventure stories with some history mixed in are my kind of stories. I like travelling to these exotic locations through these characters. This film has a unique balance of comedy, action, stunts, and adventure. When Nazis are your villains, this is how they should be used. As slimy creatures that can get their butts handed to them by Indiana Jones.My Grade: A+"
"I've been avoiding Indiana Jones like the plague until tonight when I decided to see what it's all about. And boy was I in for a treat! I was laughing so hard at every action scene! The music was so laughable, Harrison Ford played worse than Paris Hilton sings and every cliché imaginable was there.The plot is virtually non-existent during the first half of the movie and when the real action finally kicks in, you see Dr. Jones escaping from difficult situations with unbelievable ease, the ridiculous music score serving as another way of applauding his actions. Those were the best bits. Because then you have the totally random ending that turns your laughter into a WTF expression.The characters are paper-thin - not to mention Spielberg's obsession with the Germans (or anyone non-American or non-Jewish) who have to be depicted as either superevil or superstupid.Unintentionally funny, totally predictable and a waste of money and film. How anyone with an average IQ can enjoy this is beyond me."
"In 1936, Indiana Jones, an archaeologist and adventurer, is hired by the US government to find the lost Ark of the Covenant, rumoured to be buried in a hidden vault somewhere in Egypt. His quest takes him first to Nepal to recover a key artefact, and then to Cairo in a desperate race against time to find the Ark before Nazi agents also hunting it.For me, this is simply the best action film ever made. This film just roars along at an incredible speed, and it has everything in it - secret temples, tarantulas, Injuns, bar brawls, romance, Egyptology, Nazis, pompous Frenchmen, street fights, monkeys, buried treasure, snakes, car chases, pirates, submarines, the wrath of God and government coverups. I mean, what more could anybody honestly want ? The screenplay by Lawrence Kasdan, from an original (well, sort-of) idea by George Lucas, is just terrific but it's the sheer frenetic pace of the film that just sweeps you along - the story never stops for anything. It's a textbook model of how to cut all the flab out of a movie until there's just the good stuff left. The genius of the film is of course the genius of the great Steven Spielberg, with his unique combination of absolute technical mastery of the medium and his amazing capacity to entertain, but the sheer talent of the people behind him are what make this arguably his best film. John Williams' score is perhaps his best, with the most memorable of any of his great themes and entire sequences (the map room, the truck chase, the final ceremony) just awash in marvellously atmospheric music. The stuntwork (Glenn Randall, Peter Diamond, Terry Leonard, Vic Armstrong) is the best I've seen in any movie, and Deborah Nadoolman's wonderful costumes, Ben Burtt's sound effects and the special effects by Richard Edlund, Kit West, Bruce Nicholson and Chris Walas are simply fabulous. You can't have a great movie without great performances, and the entire cast bring such a sense of fun and enthusiasm to their characters that they are impossible to resist. This is Ford's classic hero performance - he fits into Indiana Jones seamlessly and somehow manages to be lovable, heroic, scruffy and noble all at the same time. Allen punches and kicks her way through the film with terrific aplomb and still manages to also be a classical romantic heroine. Freeman, Davies and Elliott all devour their roles with gusto and Lacey is indisputably the best, and I mean the best, Sinister Nazi ever to grace the screen. Despite what any critics might say, movies always have and always will be about one main thing - telling a story in pictures. This movie is a deliriously brilliant piece of visual storytelling with an unbeatable capacity to entertain. Outstanding."
"Here it is, February of 2005 and I had yet to see Raiders Of The Lost Ark (or the other 2 in the trilogy for that matter). For some reason, it did not appeal to me. I did not get into movies until the early '90s and never got around to seeing it. However, upon urging of my friend I decided to rent it. I have to give credit where credit is due. Indiana Jones paves the way for the Tomb Raiders and other various movies of the same type.Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is a doctor in archeology who teaches at a college and in his spare time, finds rare artifacts and saves the world from Nazis. In this case, he is trying to find the Ark Of The Covenant, which at one time held the original Ten Commandments that Moses chiseled into the stone tablets. The Nazis, along with help from Jones' arch rival Rene Belloq, are trying to find the Ark for their own purposes. Along the way, Indiana meets up with a woman named Marion (Karen Allen), who he jilted in the past, which is not really explained in this movie but they end up helping each other in the search for the Ark.The special effects and the action in Raiders Of The Lost Ark are exceptional, considering this was made in 1981. It set the bar reasonably high for action/adventure movies, even to this day as many movies are still compared to the Indiana Jones trilogy. It holds up well, considering most of the movies from the early 80's are very dated and hard to watch anymore. 8.5/10"
"I watched this film on the opening night, and I was extremely perplexed walking out. The first thing that puzzled me was how on earth the film got away with a PG rating. I figured it this way. It was trying to be a kids adventure film, but was so poor that it needed to compensate through over the top violence and horror. So my puzzlement was how on earth Lucas and Spielberg managed to bend the arms of the censors to get their PG rating, which allowed them to keep on marketing the film as children’s fare. And the other thing that puzzled me was that the movie was over before it had even started. I hadn’t noticed a story starting anywhere, so I was wondering how the movie could have finished. In other words, there was no film, just a blaze of action, and then suddenly the lights coming on. I heard someone comment on the way out, “I’ve never seen anything like that before.” I don’t know if she meant it in the same way as I did, but it was exactly my sentiment. I had never seen anything like that before! A film that’s not a film at all! Just an excuse to put one action sequence after another. In fact, the censors should have banned the film on account of its having no story. How could Lucas and Spielberg get away with this?! The overall impression I got was that there’s something very rotten going on in the film world now.The above response was instantaneous, and it was before all the legend around this film had grown up. I didn’t think the film was going to be a hit. In fact, I thought it was going to fall flat on its face. But the film went on to break box-office records everywhere, and after the legend had cemented, I started to have different feelings. I reasoned that I may have missed something the first time, and after reading the umpteenth glowing review the film began to look better in my memory. However a recent viewing helped to dispel all these false notions. It must be stated out and out. This film is bad!!! There’s nothing more to be said about it, but there’s a lot to be said about the audience. I think it’s high time that we said a few things about the “movie brats” and the popular appeal that they court. The thing started proper with Star Wars in 1977, and this is where the Raiders phenomenon begins really. Star Wars is an equally bad movie, but it had a few things going for it. It was presented as a myth, or fairy tale, for the modern age, and it worked too. Three reasons for this. One, the groundbreaking special effects gave it an epic quality, exactly in keeping with the space mythology being presented. Two, the Hollywood narrative was totally disbanded, giving way for an episodic structure. This helped the myth-making, because without a narrative drive people could read whatever they liked into the movie. And three, the notion of an omnipotent “force”, with both a good and dark side, captured the imagination of a world moving towards “new ageism”. So, Star Wars started it all, and the “new age” of the Hollywood blockbuster had begun. These films don’t rely on the traditional virtues of film anymore. Their aim is no wow audiences with something else, more specifically, the expensive, special effects laden set piece. They cater to the New Age mindset of “me me me”. People don’t go to the watch the stories of other people anymore. They go to participate in the megalomania of the filmmakers who were making inflated films with inflated budgets and inflated subjects. It was the “me me me” for the filmmakers, and the vicarious “me me me” for the viewers. In short, the pornography of self worth. And Raiders is only another early landmark in this trend.Lucas and Spielberg claim to be reviving the B movie adventure serials of the thirties, but there is something horribly ingenuous here. B movies are cheaply done, purely escapist, and never meant to draw attention to themselves. A film like Raiders does nothing but draw attention to itself. It’s only an excuse to use the episodic structure, so that one set-piece can be followed by another without worrying about character or plot. But all this doesn’t explain why Raiders became so popular. I guess the secret lies in the hero – Indiana Jones. When Star Wars kicked off the whole thing, there was an epic but no hero. Luke Skywalker is in no sense a hero. Only Hans Solo has a semblance of heroic about him, but was much too roguish. I guess the original idea was to get Harrison Ford a new vehicle so that he could be a braver and less cynical Hans Solo. So that’s my theory. Raiders is only a continuation of Star Wars, supplying the hero which the first film sorely lacked. So Indiana Jones comes along, and the definitive American hero for the “new age” is born. He is up to his neck in Hollywood excess and that’s all that matters.So don’t be fooled by all these reviews here that praise this film to the skies, calling it escapist fun. There may have been some thrills for the audience back in 1981, but most of the excitement was from the audacity of breaking with tradition, ignoring story and engagement with the characters, concentrating on spectacle and excess, and participating in an experience of concerted megalomania. After Star Wars, this film really cemented the ground for Hollywood excess. Most of the people here are not judging the film itself. When people say that Star Wars is good, I think they are in their New Age pious mood. The same sort of thing when they say that Raiders is good."
"Inspired by the movies and serials enjoyed by Steven Spielberg and George Lucas in their youth, Raiders Of The Lost Ark is a relentless roller-coaster of a film that sees the bearded movie moguls expertly combining action, romance, horror, adventure, fantasy and comedy; as far as pure entertainment value goes, it doesn't get much better than this.Unlike in their later adventures for Harrison Ford's heroic archaeologist, the pair pitch the level of escapism perfectly, stretching believability to the limits occasionally, but never exceeding them (there's no flying fridges or death defying falls over a cliff in a rubber dinghy in this one). Apart from seriously underestimating the weight of gold (Indy even takes some sand out of the bag he uses to replace a solid gold idol) and expecting the audience to accept that a U-Boat would travel hundreds of miles without submerging, the film is pretty flawless, with classic scene after classic scene brilliantly executed by a Spielberg in his prime.Not yet in his forties, Harrison Ford is still young enough to give the character his all (mind you, being well into his sixties today doesn't seem to have stopped him trying), and he is given able support by a solid cast that includes John Rhys-Davies as brave Egyptian Sallah, Denholm Elliott as fellow history nut Dr. Marcus Brody, Paul Freeman as reprehensible archaeologist Dr. René Belloq, and Karen Allen as Jones's spunky sidekick Marion Ravenwood. As well as terrific performances, the film also boasts superb old-school stunts (ie., pre-CGI), excellent visual effects from Richard Edlund, and even some delightfully gruesome moments that might prove too much for some little ones: a man is impaled on spears, a German soldier is reduced to a red mist by propeller blades, faces are melted, and there is even an exploding head!!! Now that's what I call quality family entertainment!"
"I'm not going to spend much time on this as I am obviously in a massive minority by not liking it. It's taken me 20 years to finally see this film through to the end.It just bores me completely. It's a part James Bond film, which I've never had any time for. It doesn't seem any better than the 'Mummy' or 'Tomb Raider' type films (ZZZZZZ) where the dialogue is largely incidental & which you can watch with the volume turned down and still follow. They generally concern some pre-historic torch, urn, key, lump of dog turd, that has special powers, that the hero needs to get his hands on & that just doesn't make for an interesting film.I just cannot get into films like this & never have any interests whether they achieve what they're after. In this there were a lot of scenes which seemed to be filling in time. First the Nazi's had the initiative, then Jones, then back to the Nazi's again and this went on & on & on, to the point that it wasn't dis-similar from a Steven Seagal or Van Damme film. Apart from the obvious superior quality of acting in this, the fighting scenes were sometimes laughable.Karen Allen threw in some incredibly wooden acting in her cliched lines she was given. The ""I'm your partner"" was almost cringe making.There seems an unwritten rule that you are not allowed to comment on Raiders of the Lost Ark without mentioning Star Wars for some reason. So I love Harrison Ford films, I like George Lucas & certainly don't dislike Spielberg. Thus, I have Star Wars as one of only a dozen films in my list at 10/10, it's almost perfect. I myself, wouldn't mention this in the same breath as Star Wars. You immediately feel a part of Star Wars & it's wonderful characters, neither of which apply here.This film has never taken off in England to the extent it has done in the US. I know plenty of adults who've never seen it & many who are not mad over it. But I'll admit I've never found anyone who genuinely dislikes it. Apart from me!3/10"
"All three Indiana Jones stories were entertaining but this first one was still the best. I would think most people would agree with me on that. They would also agree this film has some very memorable scenes, famous scenes - like the opening one with the gigantic boulder chasing Harrison Ford - to the ending scene with the Ark of the Convenant opened - that will be Hollywood classics for years. In fact, to sum it all up: hundreds of years from now, I wouldn't be surprised if this is still considered one of the great adventure films of all time.The action scenes are varied, which means a lot. You don't get the same kind of jolt of adventure. You get fist fights, battles with snakes, with airplane propellers, guns, knives, poison dates, fires, supernatural plague-type winds, chases through city streets, caves, mountains....you name it, it's all in here. This movie can wear you out, which is almost a negative. The music can get too loud, the action too much, Karen Allen's mouth too profane; the credibility too much to believe, the theology too weird, etc, but no one can deny this is a fun ride all the way through. You take none of it seriously and just enjoy the adventure.Coming on the heels of Star Wars, this really made Harrison Ford a mega-star. It didn't do much for the rest of the cast but it sure boosted Ford's stock.After a long wait, this finally came out on DVD in October of 2003 and it looks great!"
"There are critics who point fingers at Raiders - and Jaws, and Star Wars - because, regardless of their quality, these movies kickstarted the new wave of setpiece-focused blockbusters, with a detrimental effect on Hollywood. However, Raiders is no more responsible for The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor than J.R.R. Tolkien is to blame for The Sword of Truth, Bram Stoker for Twilight, or Isaac Asimov for Transformers. There is a main factor which makes Raiders a timeless masterpiece and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull a piece of garbage: RESTRAINT. Consider the elegance of action scenes. Spielberg's setpieces here are stylish, kinetic, with attention to spatial relationships, cause and effect. Every action by the hero has a direct result on his surroundings, and vice versa (see the legendary prologue, the iconic truck scene). Practical effects and stunts allow for a realistic, gritty feel... which is lost when you indulge in absurd acrobatics and frames cluttered by CGI stuff (hello, Star Wars prequels!).In Raiders, the protagonist gets dusty, bloody, beaten up: every battle takes a PHYSICAL TOLL on him, much like in the first Die Hard (while in the last ones John McClaneis essentially a superhero, which DEFIES THE WHOLE POINT of it). If action has visible consequences, it's compelling. On the other hand, show our hero slamming on a hard surface after a fifty feet fall and walking away without a bruise (hello, Hobbit trilogy!), and everything INSTANTLY becomes boring. And then we have the ""Grandpa Syndrome"", which pushes aged directors to film movies their grandchildren ""can watch too"" - laudable for family comedies, often disastrous for other genres (hello, Greedo shooting first!).The plot shows restraint as well. Everything is trimmed down, elegantly simple. A clear goal (find the Ark). High stakes (if the Nazis find it first, they will gain terrible powers). Non-stop tension: Indy and Marion are constantly chased, on the run, at disadvantage, out of time (much like Han and Leia in The Empire Strikes Back and unlike in the SW prequels). Every scene advances the plot, every dialogue defines characters; there is not a single wasted frame or line.Of course, credits goes also to the fantastic script by Kasdan, with its quotable lines and the most wickedly ironic ending in action cinema; to Ford's effortlessly charismatic turn; to John Williams' soundtrack, which is the stuff of legends.A classic all directors and scriptwriters should revisit before inflating their blockbusters with useless bloat. Raiders works as well now as it did thirty years ago... while Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Attack of the Clones, The Desolation of Smaug and A Good Day to Die Hard feel already stale.10/10"
"The ""raiders of the ark"" is probably a genre by itself.It is not an action film. You should not expect more than a couple of gunfires and some whisp tricks. Is it realistic? Not at all, except if you consider that a man can move a pyramid's hone to escape from the pyramid.It is not humoristic, either (is there a single play on words?). Actually, it is rather completely stupid. A typical scene is the guy who sees a skeleton and howls like a fool for five seconds.The scenario is very boring. There is not a single second of suspense.Ironically, what makes the film watchable is the soundtrack. No, actually, it is not sufficient, I stopped watching near the end.Really, I don't understand how many people can consider this crap deserves to be watched. How can it be in the top 250 ?"
"I can't understand how this movie got rated so high. It is just yet another stupid action movie and I found really NOTHING remarkable about it. I don't think someone else could get a movie with more kitsch even if one tried, I guess that's what they mean when they say that the movie is one of a kind. It is full of silly one-liners, same idiotic comedy ""combat"" and the (how could we do without) sexy heroine that's there only to give some sex moments. There was no plot I could spot, I mean, unless you count the ""nazis digging artifact. Indiana Jones must get artifact from them"" as plot"". Could it get more stupid?? I could go talking for several pages what I disliked about this movie but I'd be just wasting my time I guess. Each to his own. For a good adventure movie I'd suggest people to see ""The Man who would be King"" instead. *seriously p****d off*"
"In 1975, George Lucas and Philip Kaufman came up with the concept of a film that would pay homage to the action serials of the 1930's and 40's like ""The Adventures of Captain Marvel"" or ""Dick Tracy"" - you know, the one's were they'd always end in a cliffhanger? However, this idea was put on hold so that Lucas could concentrate on ""Star Wars"" in 1977. After the surprise success of that film, Lucas then embarked on the proposal and enlisted the help of Lawrence Kasdan on the screenplay and gave his friend Steven Spielberg the chance to direct and prove the studio bosses wrong after the star-studded, monumental failure of his World War II comedy ""1941"", a couple of years previously. This meeting of minds resulted in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and has since became one of cinema's most revered and iconic film's. Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is a renowned archaeologist who is hired by the U.S. Government to find the Ark of the Covenant - a chest the Hebrews carried around containing the Ten Commandments. Indy is not the only one after the Ark, though, as he soon crosses paths with Hitler's Nazi's, also intent in getting their hands on the artifact. Classic Adventure film of the very highest caliber. In fact, it's hard to argue that this isn't the one to beat in terms of sheer indulgence and escapist entertainment. I grew up with Indiana Jones and there are very few characters or films who have had such a direct or major influence on my love for the cinematic art-form. It's difficult to find the words for Raiders that haven't already been said. Quite simply, it's a true action spectacle that's unparalleled and stands as one of Steven Spielberg's finest moments. He's a director that's, rightly, regarded as one of Hollywood finest filmmakers and you don't have to look much further than this film to see why. With one hair raising set-piece after another, Spielberg keeps the action relentless and fully realizes a romanticize pastiche of the aforementioned serials' clichÃ©d plot elements and devices. Of course, what aides immeasurably in bringing it all together, is a perfectly committed and physical performance from the leading man. Contrary to popular belief, Harrison Ford was the first choice for Indy. Well... it was in Spielberg's eyes, anyway. It was Lucas who wanted to cast someone else as he wanted to create a little distance from Ford having already worked with him on ""American Graffiti"" and ""Star Wars"" and as common knowledge would have it, Lucas preferred Tom Selleck. Unfortunately for him, though, he was already committed to the television series ""Magnum P.I."" which resulted in Ford securing, what would become, his signature role. I think it's fair to say that Ford has never exactly been praised for his acting range. Sure, he's certainly able to deliver some wonderful work; his powerful turn in ""The Mosquito Coast"" and his Oscar nominated performance in ""Witness"" are proof of this but his portrayal of Indiana Jones is absolutely spot on. He captures the requisite charm, wit and smarts to win you over. He exaggerates his facial expressions to the point of parody and completely sweeps the audience up in his heroic adventures. Even though he's the hero of the story, Ford never let's you think for a second that he's infallible or indestructible. Every scrape, punch or altercation still feels like it could be Indy's last and that's a fabulous achievement when you pretty much get the gist of the film's formula or structure. Considered one of the best films ever made and, to this day, remains one of the highest grossing. It went on to win four Academy Awards out of nine nominations and these accolades alone speak for themselves. I, for one, couldn't argue with any of them."
"It's the first part of adventures trilogy , going on the way of the 30s classic films and the Comics-Books language. The picture blends comedy,adventures action,rip roaring,cliff hunger,tongue-in-cheek and is extremely entertaining and fun . The archaeologist Indiana Jones with his bull whip-wielding and hat will confront dastard Nazis (Ronald Lacey) in Peru, Nepal and Egypt to the obtaining the Moiseh ark with the Covenant's tables . He's only helped by two feisty adventurers (Karen Allen and John Rhys Davies) . Indy fights nasty Arabs , decodes hieroglyphics and faces off hundreds of snakes . The movie attempts to go on the path from great classics during the 30-40s and the comic-books narrative along with the special characteristics of the terror cinema of 80 decade.Dr.Indiana executes feats of derring-do in various exotics countries. The action highlights include the opening sequence in a Peruvian jungle temple and the creepy and spooky final, but some scenes aren't for squeamish kids . It's realized in James Bond style and high-adventure and it is driven with enormous , formidable fair-play . This breathtaking movie has a number of scenes that will have you on the edge of your seat, but the action never lets up . The enjoyable screenplay was wonderfully written by George Lucas (film's producer) , Philip Kauffman and Lawrence Kasdan . In the picture there're several exotic locations , cliff-hangers, tongue-in-cheek , daring escapes , rip-roaring , derring-do , it is a very bemusing cinematic roller-coaster ride . It's a throw-back to old-fashioned Technicolor amusement with hints of serial with thousands of dollars in budget .Harrison Ford interprets masterfully the daredevil and brave archaeologist transformed into an action man . Karen Allen plays his untameable and impulsive couple who'll have a little romance with Indy . The movie has great loads of action , special effects galore and the habitual and excellent , as always , John Williams musical core . Dazzling action set-pieces are stunningly mounted by Steven Spielberg . The film has entered the lists of ten most popular of all time . It is followed by ¨Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom¨ and¨ The last Crusade¨. And by the TV series ,also produced by George Lucas : ¨The young Indiana Jones¨with Sean Patrick Flannery .It's a must see for the adventures fans . Rating : Awesome."
"It's good to know I'm not the only person in America who thinks ""The Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is stupid and offensive.  With its villains designed only as punching bags (they are human, none the less...), its heroine intended to be ogled and scream at the right moments, and its pseudo-religious claptrap, all the praise it's gotten says something very disturbing about large numbers of people."
"With all due respect for the fans of this movie or any other Indiana Jones movie, but this wasn't what I expected. I found this to be a rather weak adventure film (and I like adventure films) and I personally don't consider this a classic.The reason why this film didn't live up to my expectations is because I was hoping this to be a movie with great adventures and lots of fun, amusement and classic humor - you know, something like ""Romancing the Stone"" and ""The Jewel of the Nile"". Instead, this is much more an action film with too much tedious moments, too much action, too much characters and many annoying ones, too much military patrols and many violence. The soundtrack is cool but there is much better, none of the actors amaze and the story itself isn't all that appealing. There are some good action scenes, but other than that it's not much of a movie."
"About a couple of years back I started renting movies from IMDb top 250 and ROLA certainly doesn't belong there. It's just an average movie with a thin plot and some comic element thrown here and there. I'm not a big James Bond fan, but this is still nowhere near James Bond movies. The hero practically does nothing in the movie except chasing around treasures and losing them to people. He started with the golden thing in the beginning and lost it to Belloq. He couldn't save the girl from the blast in the truck and yet she is falling for him. He discovered the ark but lost it to the Nazis, tried to gain it back in a lame chase sequence but all in vain because .... guess what ... he lost it to the Nazis again. The Germans after recapturing it, opened it up out of curiosity only to be killed by the powers within the ark. All this while our Mr. Indiana Jones and his girlfriend were tied to a pole avoiding ""looking"" at anything that happened.Apart from finding the ark Mr. Jones had no major role to play in the entire movie other than the fact that it had to last for two hours. And being a prominent historian he was helped by some local guy to solve the mystery of the location of the ark by reading stuff off a medallion. Not to mention, he was about to eat a poisoned 'date' only to be saved by Sallah. So the only powers our great Mr. Jones had include - a sense of timing, dressing up in a rugged style (including a beard which he grew all of a sudden even though he landed in Nepal clean shaved) and a funny bone which popped up occasionally but far too spread out.The only positive part of the movie was its opening which was strong but then they lost it.Sure it paved ways for future adventure movies and it was one of its kind, but it was plain average."
"I have finally seen Raiders of the Lost Ark, after having seen the last 2 parts of the trilogy some years ago.  I was quite disappointed overall.  The opening was entertaining and strong, but then the movie fell into a horribly boring sequence.  It picks up again during the truck chase sequence, before leaving us with a ridiculously supernatural ending.  That was a let-down for a movie where everything else was reasonably realistic.Another point I wanted to mention is I can't see how this movie got a PG-13 rating.  The amount of gratuitous violence is almost overwhelming.  The body count racked up by the end of the movie is probably greater than all of the Friday the 13th movies put together.  Granted, the amount of violence is equal to many action movies out today, but they don't have PG-13 ratings. The camera lingers on mutilated faces, gallons of blood are thrown around, and countless numbers of faceless Arabs and Nazis are killed or injured. Not exactly family material.The few exciting action sequences here save this movie from being a total wreck, but I can't seen any justification for this movie's current position in the top 20 movies of all time.  Maybe the sentimental factor is the reason."
"i really don't get what people see in this film. it looks cheap. the story is cheap. the acting is poor. this is by far the worst film by Spielberg. first, i thought ""okay, if that film is directed by Spielberg, it should be fun with a little bit of brain at least."" but then i couldn't believe it. in every long minute of the film i asked myself ""when will the story begin?"" and after two hours i was completely disenchanted and yearned to the end. in my opinion the film is just for fans of poor action who give a damn about a good plot. seeing this film rated for one of the best ever makes me cry. really cry. 1/10"
"This film is a product of its time and some of the things are very advanced (for its time), so I can't give it a very low score. A lot of the things are very well done, better than some movies in this day and age.Having said that, the story isn't that much interesting. It's just a series of events, action after action, hiding then running, chasing then being chased, fighting then escaping, just random stuff.The action is fun, but it gets boring after a while. The theme song repeating 12+ times in the span of two hours is pushing it. I had often wondered why the song was so memorable and how so many people remembered it. It is catchy, but the fact that it loops makes it stick in your head.I don't understand the target demographic for this. There are murders, a man's head getting blendered by a propeller, people being burned alive and other things that is not really appropriate for children, yet this film has a PG rating. It's too childish for adults but too scary/gory for children.The first scene (the idol) is also forgotten very quickly. He tries to get an idol from the jungle, it gets stolen, and that's about it.Parents of young children, watch out, there are graphic deaths in this film. Adults, watch out, this is a very childish film that gets boring and repetitive after a while."
"There are no set qualities for a great film. Some movies like Citizen Kane are towering Cathedrals, crowned with outstanding lead performances, their every shot awash with gravitas and innovation, two hour pieces of high art with relatively simple stories. Other films are great stories, superbly told, like The Shawshank Redemption, Braveheart and Slumdog Milllionaire. And then there are films like this one which are a joyous, fun celebration of all the things we love about movies and film making.Every scene of this is fun and enjoyable. A rollicking chase between two rival archaeologists as they travel all over the world (the film using world maps so we can keep track of the action) in search of the mystical ""ark of the covenant."" Throw in some Nazis, snake phobia, cutting edge (for the time) special effects, a damsel in distress and the Saturday matinée feel and you have an adventure film like no other to that point in time.For star Harrison Ford, this film, on the back of his turn as Han Solo in an expanded role in 1980's The Empire Strikes Back confirmed his status as the pre eminent leading man of his time, and from the start, this is his movie. We follow his adventures for an inordinate number of minutes before the director shows us his face, we see him fearlessly tackle big hairy spiders, leaps of doom, deadly arrows and rolling stone balls before the film is 15 minutes old. We also see him lose his first big battle on screen with his rival Belloq. And in those first 15 minutes we learn everything we need to about his character and the film. Indy is fearless, principled, a bit of a screw up and not a particularly good archaeologist. No wonder he has to work as a teacher to pay the bills. From that point on he becomes all things to all people. The film rarely lets up on the action, with chase after chase, and usually ending in Indy being outwitted by his smarter, better resourced rival.Ford is absolutely superb. While I personally believe that the film still would have been a success had Spielberg's original choice for the role, Tom Selleck, been available, it is now impossible to see anyone else in the role. Spielberg has also surrounded Ford with a great supporting cast including Denholm Elliott, John Rhys Davies, Paul Freeman, Karen Allen and Ronald Lacey, as well as a very young Alfred Molina. Allen in particular is great as the love interest/ damsel in distress.The effects, for the time were breathtaking, bringing the settings alive and nearly making us believe that the Nazis faces are melting at the film's end. Some of the blue screen shots leave a little to be desired, but it was still fairly early in the evolution of that film making technology, and so these are forgivable. The set pieces are expertly realized and the fight scenes well choreographed.In the end Raiders is the finest example of the adventure genre, made the more entertaining for the fact that our protagonist is not a particularly successful adventurer. It has enough silly to be fun, without being stupid and remains, more than 30 years on, as one of the most entertaining films not just of its era, but in all of American cinema."
"Raiders of the Lost Ark is directed by Steven Spielberg and collectively written by Lawrence Kasdan (screenplay), George Lucas (story) and Philip Kaufman (story). It stars Harrison Ford, Karen Allen, Paul Freeman, Ronald Lacey, John Rhys-Davies and Denholm Elliott. Music is scored by John Williams and cinematography by Douglas Slocombe.What can you say about Raiders of the Lost Ark that hasn't been said before? It has been analysed, deconstructed, praised and written about at length by everyone from the highest of film critics to the man of the street film lover and his dog. Truth is, is that nothing new can be added to the millions of tomes written about what Spielberg coyly announced was his B movie homage to adventure serials of the 30s and 40s.In simple factoid terms it was roughly made for $20 million and went on to make nearly $400 million! It quickly pulled Spielberg out of a depressive rut after the critical mauling of his period comedy movie 1941. It announced Harrison Ford as a superstar actor whilst simultaneously introducing pop culture references that still thrive today. It won four Oscars and was nominated for a further four, and as it made archaeology sexy it heralded the opening of a new era for the summer blockbuster. The whole production (apart from Spielberg) were taken ill whilst filming in Tunisia and it was the start of a franchise that still brings great GREAT pleasures to millions of fans.Why is Raiders so adored? That it is a film that still entertains royally today, where once loved in 1981 is still loved by the very same older and wiser people in the new millennium? The answer is it gets everything right, it transcends its basic source to reveal one of the most exhilarating action/adventure movies ever made. It's packed with outstanding action set-pieces (amazing stunt-work), the special effects stunning, the locations are sumptuous, the cinematography gorgeous and Williams' score stirs the blood and raises the gooseflesh. The narrative is smooth and appealing in its good versus bad race against time simplicity, yet the pace is frenetic. From the establishment of the kinetic pleasures with its iconic opening section, to the gloriously gruesome finale, it's breakneck stuff that is by turns intense but played with considerable wit and playfulness.Casting is also spot on, with Ford leading the way. Ford's performance as Indiana Jones - part time teacher, part time lovable rogue who lurches from one perilous situation to another - is note perfect. It's a performance of style and substance that is often wrongly ignored by the stuffy, purely because of the genre of film it sits in. That Ford oozes comic book heroics without falling into campy cliché is a great achievement, while of course he gave us iconography unbound that still exists today. The supporting performances are also outstanding, with Allen's spunky hard drinking Marion and Freeman's weasel Nazi stooge Belloq particularly hitting the heights. While on the other side of the camera and at the writing table, the trio of Spielberg, Kasdan and Lucas prove to be a meeting of classical adventure loving heart and minds, for the film is crafted with humour, energy and skill. It undoubtedly owes a debt to olde Hollywood fare like Gunga Din, Secret of The Incas and Valley of the Kings (and more), while some stereotyping of natives exists because the film harks back to olde Hollywood adventure movies! And undeniably it's a teeny–tiny bit annoying that as we enter the home straight Allen's character arc has her shift from tough dame to ""save me Indy"" fodder, but small complaints be damned. This is top line genre film making, where true love is proved to always last a lifetime, because, quite simply, Raiders of the Lost Ark is still the modern day template for action/adventure movies. 10/10"
"This is a grade Z movie, just the mindless piece of garbage known under the name of ""Spielberg's classics"": one-dimensional cartoonish characters, no more intelligent than a condom commercial.Don't be fooled by their appearance. They are just apes in human suites. Watching the movie gave me the experience of a Discovery Channel documentary involving animal behavior. They seem to have no seing of reality above their own immediate needs such as territory and reproduction.However, they are not 4 millions old remainings of apelike ancestors, but modern idiotized masses reduced to the lower level of humanity. I would doubt Spielberg would be one of them. He clearly knows how to profit out of other people uneducation and genetic-inherited stupidity."
"This is one of Steven Spielberg's all time classic movies!! ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is an unbelievably remarkable and adventuresome comedy flick that is synonymous with Harrison Ford!! The enormous popularity of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" evoked a charisma that the American movie audience took to instantaneously!! This website ranks ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" as the 17th best film out of the top 250 films ever made, this is very impressive!! The audience research report on this movie has it at an 8.7 rating out of a possible 10... Also very impressive!! AFI (American Film Institue) ranks this film as one of the top 100 American films ever made!! The comedic suspense to this film is extremely well developed and overall, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is entertaining with a capital E from start to finish!! The famous machete scene is the most identifiable scene in this movie...IT IS UTTERLY HILARIOUS!! I found this movie to be one of the stellar trademarks in the American cinema!! ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" was a harbinger of things to come with the happy go lucky disposition of the 1980's!! The ending was irksome, yet also very comical, and Harrison Ford is a well deserved recipient of many accolades for his acting performance in this movie!! Throughout all of this movie's flippant demeanor, the dubious societal nemesis of bureaucracy reared it's ugly head!! Oh well!! Such as life!! I have not seen ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" in quite some time, and I am very tempted to see it again in the very near future!! I give this movie a resounding five star approval for directing and acting excellence!! YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM!!"
"As in ""Big Budget B"" Movie, the sort of visually spectacular, splendidly orchestrated live-action cartoon that Lucas & Spielberg pioneered separately and, on this occasion, together. In 1936 heartthrob college professor & graverobbing mercenary Indiana Jones (Ford, perhaps by way of Harold Robbins & Steve McQueen) is hired by the US Army to find & loot the original Hebrew Ark of the Covenant from its presumed hiding place in a lost Egyptian city before Hitler's SS/Gestapo/Afrika Korps/Kriegsmarine/Luftwaffe/Abwehr can get it. To do this he must first procure a critical icon from a girlfriend (Allen) that he dumped and who is now running Kathmandu's answer to Rick's Cafe Americain (there's no piano, but the wind whistles most soulfully). A two-minute reverse ""Casablanca"" interlude ends with another plot twist and plenty of enjoyable, stunning mayhem. Characters come & go in no particular order, including nebbish professor Brody (Elliott), Egyptian laborer Sallah (Rhys-Davies, who could give any Tonto or Dr. Watson a run for his money), tramp sea captain Katanga (Harris), rival mercenary Belloq (Freeman, who eventually comes across as French) and cartoonishly evil Nazis (Lacey, Kahler & Higgins, all perfectly cast). Ford holds the film together with a quintessentially American mix of determination, frustration, weariness & wonder. Allen brings a coarse feminism to the role of damsel tied to a set of railroad tracks. The film fails because its convoluted plot can never find even the tiniest ground in common sense, much less reality, with plot holes large enough for whole solar systems to nest comfortably. The largest of many large, of course, is that the hero's job is to rob other peoples of their cultural treasures and sell them for money. In a scene that desperately needed to be cut, Belloq actually points this out to Jones. Other giant leaps include Hitler's obsession with the occult (nonexistent), Germany's dominance in Egypt and the Mediterranean (never happened) and enough Biblical heresies to make Harry Potter look like the Pope. The charm of ""Lost Horizons"" (Jones flies over the same mountains at about the same time, but Shangri-La prefers Ronald Colman) and even ""King Solomon's Mines"" is replaced here by breathtaking action punctuated by Groucho-esq one-liners (""I'm making this up as I go along"") and the obligatory juvenile, Spielberg gross-out scenes (Tarantino slices off body parts, Spielberg likes snakes, bugs & sharks). Still, Lucas & Spielberg are the masters of effective excess and ""Raiders"" is best enjoyed as a series of cartoon or ""Lone Ranger"" or ""Perils of Pauline"" adventures (the opening sequence is supposedly inspired by a Disney Ducks cartoon, anyway). Williams's music is as wonderful as any he's done and perhaps the best ever in an action film. The success of the franchise assured, here are some ideas for sequels: ""Raiders of the Declaration of Independence,"" ""Indiana Jones & George Washington's False Teeth,"" and ""The Hunt for Lenin's Embalmed Remains."""
"A rip-roaring adventure with lots of hand-to-hand battles and plenty of guns means only one thing: entertainment for the whole family! There's not too much blood and gore, but it's still way up there in the body count department. Much of the thrill of this beloved movie is in the fright factor, so cadavers, snakes, spiders, and nasty villains (mostly Nazis and Nazi sympathizers) also abound. Throughout the film, there is a parade of anti-Nazi symbolism and sly religious satire. Harrison Ford is the embodiment of Indiana Jones -- dry, fearless, and as indestructible as a cartoon coyote. The female lead in an Indiana Jones movie is sort of an honorary boy, no more sexual than the girls in boys' adventure magazines, although Marian can more than take care of herself and is not helpless in the face of danger. The special effects, astonishing at the time, are still amazing, and Lucas' experience of ""Star Wars"" is visible. The movie is just plain fun."
"What's this - 2  Speilberg films in the top 10? Are you people mental, have you been out of the house in the last 5 years? Are there subliminal messages being transmitted in the endless re-runs of 'Dawson's Creek'? That this chump should have one film in the top 250 is criminal. I keep running across the term 'soul' in the user comments. The soul of a movie, the amplification of soul, yadda, yadda. What goes on here, did the Germans win the war? Cripes, the man is a living Xerox machine who couldn't successfully wrap up a storyline to save his many fold bank accounts. It's outa my hands."
"Since everybody knows what this movie is about, mine will be a review of the strongest and weakest points. At the time of release, this seemed a brand new approach to storytelling. I am not surprised it was a big success: Harrison Ford was smoldering hot and the supporting cast was great, with a special mention to John Rhys-Davies.With the passing of time and repeated views, I find the following weaknesses, common to many Spielberg (and action) movies: the overbearing soundtrack. I know many love it, I cannot stand it anymore. During the truck chase scene, there is nothing but the loud orchestra score booming ceaselessly, while Indy gets beaten but bounces back like a rubber man the thin plot. The search for the Ark is just an excuse to create one action scene after the other. They increase in violence and implausibility, until the last one, possibly the silliest of the movie the last ""action scene"". The ritual proposed by Belloq serves no purpose, apart from providing a bombastic ending to Indy's troubles. Anyway, it is unbelievable to imagine that Nazi troops would indulge the request of the French archaeologist the ""super hero"" nature of Indy. Despite the premise that he is a ""normal"" guy, Indy is shown to suffer only slightly from inhuman beatings all the sequels. None managed to reach even half-way the level of ""Raiders"" and considering this one already had its flaws.On the plus side: there are some moments of humour, unfortunately not enough. The best is the famous scene of Indy shooting the huge, menacing black-clad guy in the market. For one precious scene like this, we have the long and pointless fight with the German guarding the plane, back to conventional narrative an attractive hero with some intellectual pretense. Indy is supposed to be a beauty with a brain, contrary to way too many superheroes who are infesting the silver screen (even more so nowadays)the ironic endingConclusion: what seemed an innocuous narrative that looked back to the old serial movies of the past, turned into a monster that spawned endless sequels and imitators, creating the action-without-soul blockbusters plaguing more than ever contemporary cinema."
"I confess, in all the ruckus and commotion over Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull I lost sight of what really mattered and what really brought out my inner child. Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the finest films ever made and do I dare say Spielberg's masterpiece? Yes I'm aware that Schindler's List is the better film but quality can be measured in so many different ways. Harrison Ford first dons the fedora here and at first glance we can tell that this is his prized role and the one he will forever be loved for. Indiana Jones is a superhero but he is a superhero who can captures the movie goer's imaginations and hearts in a way that Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man could only do in his wildest dreams. The audience admires Indiana Jones because is brave, he's intelligent, he is the personification of the ideal romantic hero and most of all he is human in ways we can identify with. There's just something that all fits together about this picture. It is one of the few films that has truly grasped onto my inner child and imagination. Never has an adventure been as grand as it is Raiders. Karen Allen is as important to this film's success as Ford's. She is the perfect love interest for Indiana Jones because she brings out the best qualities in him. She like Jones is spunky and full of the adventurous ambition. She isn't baggage and she quite often gives our hero a run for his money. She like Indy is also very human and likable. The romance here is real. It's hard to imagine real love and romance in an adventure film but it is real. We liked Marion Ravenwood as Indy's love interest because the scenes between her and Indiana Jones showed love in all the deepness and emotional conviction it has, and it didn't show us James Bond's make love and throw away love. The love in Raiders is as close to the real emotion as your going to get to in these types of films..I really think the plot here is the best of the series of Jones films, all though it really isn't fair comparing the sequels to this simply because ""This IS history"". Hitler wanting the most sacred of Jewish artifacts to conquer the world is one of the most inspired premises of well, any film. We have the romantic hero in Indiana Jones but we also have evil in the form of the Nazis. The cult of personality surrounding Hitler stays with you. I consider myself to be smart and sensible and I don't get afraid much but the stock footage of Nazi rallies really scare the hell out of me. The Nazis were one of the must vile cults to ever exist and if any thing could embody modern day evil it would be them. Like Indy the villains are to be taken very seriously. By no means are the Nazis in Raiders cut out villains. Even our chief antagonist Rene Belloq is hesitant to ally himself to them, he says it is a necessary evil.Execution is key to Raider's success. The script is intelligent but it also shows that it's roots where planted by the serials of the 30's. Spielberg and company take the material as serious as the grave. Nothing is played for laughs or shock value for the sake of laughs or shock value. In creating a homage to the classic serials, Spielberg actually outdid them and set a new unreachable high standard for the adventure/action flick.I love the story of Indiana Jones' humble origins. Say what you will about George Lucas but steering Spielberg away from doing a James Bond film and pointing him toward this direction is one of the defining moments of cinematic history. Before you take the kids to see fun popcorn film Crystal Skull show them the cinematic master piece Raiders of the Lost Ark."
"This movie is incredible. I really mean it. Everything about it is timeless. From the amazing score, action, characters, dialogue, romance, writing, direction, and effects, this movie excels at everything. This is one of the movies out there that pretty much everyone loves, and it is for good reason. It is the greatest action movie ever, and the perfect movie in my eyes."
"I must have seen this movie between 50-100 times. My parents passed the Indy trilogy down to me as a kid and they blew my mind. They were just so immensely enjoyable with the big action set pieces and in my opinion the best action hero in Indiana Jones fighting against evil to protect the good. There wasn't green screen overuse or a crazy amount of gore, just this professor who had the requisite set of skills to take on the Nazis and recover this artifact of unimaginable power. I loved Raiders immediately and even over 30 years later it stands the test of time.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* In the year 1936 a group of men hike through the jungle in Peru. They find a dead body that has been hit with a poison dart and they estimate he's been there for 3 days. One of the men tries to attack one of the others but in shadow he pulls out his whip and uses it to disarm him. The attacker runs off and the man with the whip steps out of shadow. He's wearing a fedora and a leather jacket, he's later introduced as Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford).They arrive at the temple and his friend urges him not to go in. Indy mentions that one of his competitors disappeared in there. They go in and the place is covered in cobwebs and insects and they are both covered in tarantulas. They brush them off and keep going. They are about to continue when they spring a trap activated by the light in the room. Spikes shoot out of the walls and hanging off one of them is Indy's competitor. They make their way past a couple of more traps when they reach the artifact. It's on a trigger that is activated by the object's weight. Indy seemingly makes the switch but activates another trap which lowers a giant boulder. After his friend tries to betray him and dies himself, Indy escapes the temple but he's intercepted by another archaeologist named Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman). Belloq has bent the native tribe to his will and uses them to steal the artifact from Indy. Indy is able to slip away while Belloq is commanding the tribe and a chase begins. There's a seaplane waiting on the river and Indy is able to evade the tribe and hop aboard. While they're flying away, a snake crawls into the seat and Indy freaks out. He's afraid of snakes but his pilot tells him to show a little backbone.There's so much I could say about Raiders of the Lost Ark. But what makes this movie so special to me is that it's the best integration of really cool action scenes with hilarious comedic moments that I've ever seen. I'll talk about the characters more later but with this movie Indy will get into some intense gunfights or fistfights, or he'll be trying to escape a trap and he'll trip or get socked in the jaw or slip up on the weight of an artifact and set off another trap. It's kind of beautiful to watch how seamless it is and I laugh a lot every time I watch this movie. I think every action/adventure movie tries to do that and most of them succeed but I feel like this is by far the movie that does it best.Moving to the characters, I mentioned in the opening paragraph that Indy is my favourite action hero of all time. For me this is true because his character works on many levels. Of course he's a professor first and he always comes across as knowledgeable of his surroundings but he also works as a badass action hero. He overcomes odds through work with his gun, his whip and more importantly his fists. Lastly, he's not perfect like a James Bond type spy, he's constantly screwing up or almost dying, only getting by through a combination of luck and help from his friends. Marion is absolutely no slouch either. She's fully capable, she owns a bar and is a drinking champ, she greets Indy by punching him in the face and she's responsible for getting him out of a couple of jams. They feel organic together and the romance between them is played just right. Sallah is really underrated, he's a funny and helpful sidekick and John Rhys-Davies is so great playing him. Denholm Elliot is good in his brief appearance. Speaking quickly about the villains, Belloq is actually a solid adversary. He strikes the balance of villainous yet understated perfectly. I find him to be less maniacally evil and more just an @$$%^*& who piggybacks off of Indy's success.The Indy trilogy really shows how great of an actor Harrison Ford is. He's one of the better actors of his generation and I think he's the template for the blockbuster action hero. He can perform in any genre and he quietly helps make the movie as awesome as it is. Without him, I don't know if these movies would work as well as they do.With this being an adventure/action movie the set pieces are exciting and provide the thrills that you're looking for in this genre. From dodging dangerous traps to dealing with some frightening parts of the animal kingdom, all of the action scenes are fun to watch and are extremely entertaining. I would also add that the entire trilogy travels to some cool locations and add to the mystery surrounding some of the supernatural elements of this franchise.Some people consider Raiders to be the movie that helped define the modern action/adventure movie. I would agree, I don't have a ton of experience with older adventure movies but you can see touches of this movie in films even today. Even with some of the theories about the plot today, to me this movie is perfect and I can't recommend it highly enough."
"This is an adventure film and perhaps one of the best.Indiana Jones, the archaeology professor takes us on an adventure and lets us know about things that we never knew. I am not sure if they ever existed but as along as I am on fun ride, I am pretty happy with the fiction element of the ride. And this one is a fun ride and good one too. Having said that, I still can't say if it still has the charm of 1981 (rather I saw it first time in 2002) but as I saw it today, it made a fun ride. Thanks to Harrison Ford for carrying the style and flamboyance needed and to Steven Spielberg and George Lucan and team who made this INDY possible. It's an adventure of 1930's and art direction and cinematography are superb. The music which has now became a signature tune even to film awards in India is gonna stay with us for a long time. Some film makers have claimed this film to be changing their mind and pulling them into films, example Nagesh Kukunoor. So the impact of the film is understandable and yet is extensive. The special effects are nowhere when compared to what we have today, but it was made but what was there in 1981 and boy, I must say it will stand better than many special effects films even 100 years later. The best thing probably is the setup, there is a dialogue initially to help us understand what is the purpose of the adventure and then once the adventure rolls in, we are put aback by thrills and stunts and more than anything, the enigma of a charismatic man called Indiana Jones.I would go with 4/5 and recommend it to all those adventure and fun loving guys. And for all the parents, your kids will love this film more than the recent crap films like JOURNEY or anything. I strongly believe this."
"Indiana Jones is still an enduring and timeless classic in every way a great film should be. I can watch this movie when I'm a graying, senile 90 years old grandmother and still LOVE IT! The story, acting, suspense, adventure, thrills, chills and everything in between is universal and timeless. It doesn't get better than this combo of Lucas, Ford and Spielberg!Some of the photography, pacing and ending Special Effects is dated a bit, but I think Ford's charisma, charm and ruggedness still holds up with age. He's still so dreamy I'm still in love ;) Worth a rewatch if you haven't seen it in years like me!"
"I think that this movie is TRULY better than most of the big movies coming out now. I haven't seen Ender's Game either, but from the looks of the trailer it didn't seem too appealing (most of the shots being actors in front of CGI backgrounds). Raiders of the Lost Ark is a bit of a miracle for a couple of reasons. It features a dazzling number of practical effects that work better than any post-production trickery: the shooting arrows, the boulder, the truck chase, the explosions, the snakes... you can see and feel that they are real, even if the boulder is plastic and some of the snakes are rubber. The final Ark sequence is somewhat cheesy with the optical printing effects, but the ghosts being added are still real bits of cloth that were filmed being pulled about in water. So, it's real and it has a human handprint on it instead of being disconnected like so many of the pixellated effects we see today. Also, the editing is terrific. It's so easy to ignore it because you are too caught up in what is going on, but that's exactly the point: The editing follows a specific train of thought in each scene as we can see what the characters are literally thinking. Take the opening scene where Indiana hears the gun cock behind him... we see the his head turn slightly with the silhouette of his ear clearly outlined. In a couple of rapid-fire shots, we see him take out his whip and knock the gun out of the man's hand. Watch it in slow-motion, seriously. I prefer watching movies like this as opposed to the James Bond movies where Bond always knows exactly what to do but they never really show how... ""Raiders"" follows the thought process every step of the way. A lot of people say that cinematography in movies is boring today, but you might not exactly know what that means. There is a ""correct"" way most movies are shot that is actually quite boring. Use close-ups for dialogue (often with the listener out of focus in the foreground), use wide shots for action, and shake the camera a lot. ""Raiders"" refuses to do that. The cinematography makes sure that we can see what is going on, but also makes sure to keep it interesting. We look at the actors from above and below. We see them through dense forests, candle flames, and lattice walls. It's a brilliant variety that often goes unnoticed. Anyhow, all of the technical feats somehow step out of the way so you can enjoy the ultimate roller coaster ride. This is no average Hollywood movie as we see characters get dirtied up and beat up and even looking pretty ugly sometimes... It's a throwback to when movies didn't take themselves so seriously and instead focused on being fun. Years later when people forget ""Gravity"" and even ""12 Years a Slave"" they will still remember this one."
"If you have not seen this film, this is it. The top. This is the most exciting and entertaining film that has ever been made. Harrison Ford creates a truly iconic character named Indiana Jones. Conceived by George Lucas and molded by Spielberg, Raiders of the Lost Ark is truly a sight to be seen. Inspired by many of the 1930's serial films like its cousin Star Wars, Raiders keeps you on the edge of your toes. The whip, the leather jacket and of course the hat have become iconic with film lore. Indiana Jones is the all American hero, the American James Bond. The sequels were all great and highly entertaining films thanks to Lucas, Spielberg and Ford, but Raiders is truly a masterpiece to behold."
"Raiders of the Lost Ark is an example of a perfect movie.Quite a bold statement I hear you cry, but I'll do my best to quantify it!Put very simply, this film delivers on everything it promises. The poster and artwork for the movie tell you that it is a 1940s adventure with Nazi villains and a dashing male hero who uses a whip! Not to mention the pursuit of an artifact of ""actual"" biblical proportions. There's a girl in there too so a bit of romance as well. It is a perfect realisation of character and story. Every component fits together like a well made suit, from the sweeping soundtrack that elevates your emotions and fills you with awe, to the perfect casting choices. All of the people involved in this film clearly loved both every moment making and working together on it. This film is compelling to watch and carries you from the very first opening scene right through to the end with a rewarding, fitting conclusion to the story. Quite honestly I am really struggling to think of a single criticism. Oh some might say the effects look dated in places, but it simply doesn't matter because you are enjoying the ride too much. Furthermore, It can be watched many times without losing any value. I believe that this is because every component of the film is being steered by people in their prime and at the top of their game. If you're not appreciating the music, then it's the cinematography. If you're not rooting for the very likable characters, then you're noticing the amazing sound design. Every department; stunts, makeup, wardrobe, writing... all of them, they all gave everything and achieved what they set out to create. Thus a perfect film.If for some reason you haven't seen it... then make sure you close the curtains, dim the lights, turn the volume right up... and enjoy every moment of this cinematic delight in its fullest capacity!"
"This movie was bad ass, and Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones is a bad ass,I just love in one scene this guy with a sword comes out, and Indiana Jones is like whatever, and then he shoots him, and walks, and the scene with the Ark in which the Nazis get killed was so scary, I had nightmares (I was 9 when I saw this), and the action scenes, are so much better than the ones today, with their crappy CGI, and fake CGI explosions, and blood, this is back in the old days when action movies were real, but this one isn't cheesy as others were, this is Indiana Jones !!!!! This movie is just Awesome.A 10/0"
"Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark is the first of the Indiana Jones franchise that spawn out 3 sequels, a TV series and numerous video games. It is a classic and stood above many in the box office raking in over $380 million dollars. It also won 4 Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects, Best Sound, Best Film Editing and Best Art Direction.The movie pulls surprises after surprises, like what happened when the Ark was opened, that scene alone is not something you will expect as it starts from the time it was opened till when it was shut, you will be stunned.It packages in its 115 minutes run, a bolder chase, arrow flying here and there, submarine, car chase, gun fights, drama, comedy, adventure, Nazis, Gestapo, Arabian men and Spiritual power in high places, all this for your fun and view, in a movie that is shot in numerous locations.There was a scene where Indy is trapped in the well of souls with over 7,000 snakes, now that is a sight you really want to see. The car chase reminded me of the Mad Max movie Road Warrior it was intense, fun and dangerous.The movie plot has our favorite hero, trying to get a solid-gold idol somewhere in the Peruvian jungle in 1936. He gets it then loses the artifact to his rival and the movie antagonist who is French archaeologist named Belloq (Paul Freeman).Indy is recruited by the Army Intelligence to stop the Nazi's who seem to be after the Ark of Covenant so as to gain power to topple the world.So Indy saddles up and goes to Nepal to meet with his Mentor Ravenwood only to discover that he had died, so he is left to ride along Marion (Karen Allen) his daughter to Cairo where they meet Indy's sidekick Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) as they team up to stop the Nazis.The movie is one joy ride from place to place the movie had quite an interesting bunch of characters that will keep you both thrilled and entertained, one character that catches my fancy was the Gestapo. Raiders of the Lost Ark is set to be a sequel to the movie that came after it, as Temple of Doom was set in 1935. The movie has received numerous acclaim ranked 66 in the AFI's top 100 movies 10th Anniversary and also ranked 10th in AFI's top ten thrills.Here is Indiana Jones at the very beginning an intro to the character that we all love and admire, I believe there is no reason why you should not have seen this classic.www.lagsreviews.com"
"This is the first movie in the Indiana Jones series. It is also the best film in the series. Indy is hired by the US government to track down the sacred arc of the covenant. While he is on his quest the Nazis are also searching for the arc. This is a wonderful adventure story that covers many countries. Harrison Ford was born to play this role, and he does it with flair. After having seen this film quite a few times, you also get to pick out the Easter eggs that are scattered around. One hint is be on the lookout for two well known Star Wars droids.
I do not think that there was a better combination in the 80's than Lucas and Spielberg. This in everything you would want from an adventure movie and more."
"It was great for its time. An enjoyable watch today and a good laugh because it reminds you how things used to be and where we've come from there. All in all, this film is a piece of history."
"""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981) is undoubtedly an iconic adventure classic. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:Raiders of the Lost Ark is a thrill ride, but some aspects leave a few things to be wanted. The editing during the movie's first half can be a bit choppy at times, and a few plot details throughout the film are somewhat illogical. The villains are quite one-dimensional, and a certain sequence has a very clear use of greenscreen as well. The more of a nitpicker one is, the more this will be bothering, but all aspects named can be overlooked with any major effort.A warning should however be issued to those who are sensitive to blood and gruesome effects. The opening feature some stark images in this category, there is a shoot-out scene early on that doesn't shy away from this either, and the infamous ending is surprisingly brutal and gory when compared to the overall lighter mood of the movie. It has currently a PG rating, but a PG-13 rating would be more appropriate as the violence alone pushes the movie into R areas at said times.Finally, the iconic status of Raiders of the Lost Ark derives mostly from its cult position as well as its 80's nostalgia. At the time, this was clearly groundbreaking in most of its areas, but today, its technical features are matched more and more often within the genre. Nevertheless, Indiana Jones' charisma still hits home, and ultimately, the portrayed adventures has maintained their excitements. Don't rush into to the following sequel at the cost of appreciating this one, as Temple of Doom fails drastically to deliver entertainment of the same level.My personal grade: an entertaining 7/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews."
"Raiders of the Lost Ark is a classic with everything you expected. It has violence, romance maybe even comedy! The acting is superb from every actor, and the Nazis were played magnificently. Raiders of the Lost Ark has an amazing story line, with the hunt for secret treasure, trying to capture love and defeating the villains. While it definitely shouldn't be a PG (because of gore) it is amazing and family friendly, if your child likes blood and snakes."
"Great, but probably half an hour too long. Seems like they couldn't decide on which ending to use so they used both. Definitely watch it If you haven't though."
"One of the most iconic heroes in movie history. You got George Lucas fresh out of episode 5, you got Steven Spielberg with movies such as Jaws to his name and you got Harrison Ford who by the time Raiders had come out he was already a household name. I think that--is a formula to success."
"How in the universe is this movie Only rated 8.5 stars overall?!?! ANYONE that rated it less than 9 is an idiot, I'm not prone to nasty, argumentative online vitriol; far too old for that trump-ian nonsense. This movie is perfect, one of the greatest action adventures ever. From direction to script to casting and acting..perfect."
It's a great movie for the time. It hasn't aged the best but that beginning alone makes it a decent film. Harrison ford's best character
"I re-watched Raiders a couple of months ago and, 30 something years after its release, I can find no real flaws.Rewatching Raiders this time I did notice a lot of Spielberg style similarities from movie to movie. For example, the scene where Indie chases the caravan of military vehicles reminded me of the look of Duel, Spielberg's first movie. And the way the faces melted and the way the ghosts and skeletons were animated, that was similar to Poltergeist, which Spielberg wrote. But just because he re-purposed techniques doesn't make Raiders of the Lost Ark any less grand.Raiders is as American a movie as you can get. With a swarthy hero, a loud mouth dame, and a whole lotta double cross. Remind you of any other movie about an artifact? Maybe with 'Maltese' in the title?Sure it's not 100% original and sure the effects are a bit dated but you could watch it right now and be entertained all the way through. And for that I give it an A+.Best line in the movie - 'Holy smoke my friend I'm so pleased you are not dead!'"
"Now I loved this movie a lot because it introduced us to the world of Indiana Jones and showing us how he is able to track down rare artifacts. In addition to that, this movie gave us loads of fun action, and the action (ALMOST) never stops! 
It just starts out amazing, showing us in South America that he is a cool, amazing, and FUN character to be around and explore with! 9/10 THUMBS UP!"
