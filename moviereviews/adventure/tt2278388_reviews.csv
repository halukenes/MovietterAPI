"Can a film be absurd, funny, exciting, violent and colourful at the same time? Yes. 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' combines all those elements. And I didn't even mention the most important characteristic: it is visually wonderful.In this film, director Wes Anderson creates his own universe, full of colourful characters, old-world charm and witty one-liners. The nice thing about creating your own universe is that you can make it look perfect. Every shot, every little detail and every set is flawless. From lead character Gustave H.'s purple jacket to the title of the newspaper announcing the war (The Trans-Alpine Yodel) - Anderson has given thought and attention to everything.The story is not very important, because it is merely a vehicle for the stunning visuals, the dark humour and the rapid-fire dialogue. It's all about a hotel concierge, Gustave H., who is being chased by various villains for stealing a painting. All this is set against the backdrop of the Nazis invading Central Europe (although in Anderson's fantasy world they are not called Nazis of course). Some of the scenes are very funny, but there is always a darker tone because of the looming war. Anderson doesn't shy away from extreme violence, but he shows it in an offbeat and almost comical manner.My favourite scene, in which it all comes together, shows concierges in hotels all over Europe, calling each other to help Gustave H. Each of them is shown in his hotel (with a wonderful fantasy name of course), busy doing some important job like tasting the soup or giving first aid to an unconscious hotel guest, when he is being called away to the telephone. Each hands the job over to his assistant, and answers the phone. This fast succession of little scenes is done so perfectly, it's a great joy to watch.Ralph Fiennes steals the show as the sophisticated Gustave H., who never despairs, even in the most unfavourable circumstances. He is supported by a large number of star actors, who are sometimes almost unrecognizable. Because of the amount of support actors, some of them are a bit underused. Tilda Swinton gets rather little screen time, as does Harvey Keitel.The film moves forward at a breakneck speed. You have to be very alert in order not to miss something. The plot is not always very easy to follow, and the dialogue is fast. And there are the great camera angles and the wonderful detailed sets to pay attention to. I think by seeing the film a second time you can discover lots of things you didn't notice the first time."
"My heart is still rolling from the escape to 30's Europe this afternoon, and without jet lag. This movie is an inspiration, a dream, a walk through a painting and a study of humanity. Ralph Fiennes﻿ is a phenomenon as M. Gustave. his interactions with every cast member and especially newcomer Tony Revolori are fantastic. The later holds his own weight beyond belief and the entire film is an amazing adventure with James Bond style chases, a large murder mystery, the best placed cussing and of course the sensational cinematography. The sets, models, angles and even the most nondescript characters come to life each on their own and together as a symphony of beauty. It's freaking brilliant; The Grand Budapest Hotel."
"Wes Anderson is one of the last directors -auteurs- who's got complete control on the film set and has the power to make whatever kind of film he desires. His distinct visual style is apparent since his 1996 debut Bottle Rcoket. But that was just a start, with every film he made he was perfecting his technique more and more. This marvelous attention to detail, the way he composes his shots( tracking shots, the symmetry, the characters running in slow-motion), chase scenes, love story, nostalgia, explanatory montages, the colourful set design and the prevalent theme of every one of his films: family. This all adds up to the reason why the audience enjoys Anderson's film so much. This all is brought to perfection in Grandhotel Budapest. Through complex narrative framework, which itself is a mockery of all these films that are being narrated by someone and is also being an excuse for not being too realistic, we get to a story of a young lobby boy named Zero Moustafa and Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes)the concierge of the Grandhotel Budapest. Many of the female guests of the hotel mainly come to enjoy Gustave's company. When one of these ladies passes away, Gustave grabs Zero and boards a train for her mansion. Soon he's blamed for her murder and hunted by police led by Edward Norton and a grim-faced assassin played by Willem Dafoe. There also is a love story between two young teens - Zero and Agatha (Saoirse Ronan) who has a birthmark in the shape of Mexico.I frankly don't understand how can this film be successful in the USA. This film is just so typically European, that I guess some aspects of the film Americans just aren't familiar with. Some of the humor reminded of old French, Italian and Czech comedies. Wes Anderson remains to be a stand-out filmmaker who never disappoints with any of his creations and is a safe bet to rely on his qualities. You won't want to return to the real world when the credits start to roll."
"I would consider myself a Wes Anderson fan, however in saying that, I have only seen a handful of his movies. I was very excited for The Grand Budapest Hotel, because of its excellent cast, the fact it's directed by Wes Anderson and just by how unique it looked. After watching The Grand Budapest Hotel, I can confidently say that it's my new favourite Wes Anderson film, and probably his best.As I was hoping, the story to The Grand Budapest Hotel is very original and unique, some may even say strange. And as the movie goes on, the story only gets wilder and wilder. The film is often very hilarious, with some seriously funny dark humour thrown in there as well. Characters are extremely well written, with the bond between Gustave and Zero being the backbone of the whole movie as it's so well written. The Grand Budapest Hotel features an odd narrative structure that works very well for the film, again adding to the uniqueness and freshness of it. I wasn't exactly sure how the story would play out, as I purposely avoided all promotional materiel so I would know as little as possible before watching. This was a great benefit to my viewing experience as I loved everything I saw, and felt as though nothing was spoiled from watching too many trailers.I haven't been a huge fan of most of Ralph Fiennes' work since his phenomenal performance in 1993′s ""Schindler's List"", but this is easily his best performance since then. He proves he can do comedy just as well as he can do drama, providing a perfect balance of both. Newcomer Tony Revolori is excellent as well. I won't get into the whole supporting cast because there's so many who were all so great, but I was particularly impressed by Willem Dafoe, Adrien Brody, Harvey Keitel, Jude Law and Saoirse Ronan.The Grand Budapest Hotel is definitely a Wes Anderson film, down to its very core. If you know his style, then you known what to expect, as this movie is full of it. Thankfully though, it's not a case of style over substance, with a great story to accompany the gorgeous visuals. The colour palette is beautiful; it's nice to see lot's of bright colours when so many other films are so dark and dreary. The set design and costumes are perfect, and there's so much attention to detail within the sets. The cinematography is phenomenal, and I really like how the film was presented in different aspect ratios.You really can't go wrong with this film. It's probably Wes Anderson's best film, it has gorgeous visuals, excellent acting and a wonderful story. If you're a fan of Wes Anderson's previous work, you cannot miss this, and even if you're not a fan you should go and see it anyway."
"Wes Anderson is one of the most original film makers working today. None of his films can be categorized into any particular genre. His latest, The Grand Budapest Hotel, which opened the Berlin Film Festival, continues that trend. It is a tale within a tale within another tale. Whilst every shot has been meticulously arranged as though a work of Art hanging in a museum, story wise Anderson has let his imagination run wild. Though the tale (with Tom Wilkinson as the author of the story) and the tale within the tale (with Jude Law as the young author & F Murray Abraham as the mysterious owner of THe Grand Budapest Hotel) have straightforward narratives, the tale within the tale within the tale, which comprises the bulk of the film and is set in the years preceding the Second World War, is a wild uproarious train ride of story telling. It also boasts the cast of a life time: Ralph Fiennes, Tilda Swinton, Edward Norton, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Harvey Keitel, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson & countless cameos. It will delight Anderson fans but is more likely destined for Art house cinemas as it is too off center for mainstream audiences. The production design and music are outstanding and even the end credits are imaginatively done (and received another ovation from the audience)."
"That it was directed by Wes Anderson (who has a unique style that really fascinates, but admittedly not everybody will like or warm to his style) and that the cast is so stellar were reasons enough to see 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' in the first place, as well as its many accolades and critical acclaim.While it isn't quite flawless, and it is easy to see why a number of people don't like or will not like it (due to a lot of the cast's roles being pretty short, only Gustave and Zero being fully fleshed out of the characters and those who have a problem with Anderson's style), 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is a visually stunning, hugely entertaining, wonderfully weird and impeccably cast and acted film.It really stuns visually, with cinematography that is not only clever in technique but also gorgeous in aesthetic and tight, fluid editing. The costumes, production design and hair and make-up richly deserved their Oscar/Academy Award wins, the costume and production design have a lusciously colourful fairy-tale feel while also given substance by the bleakly atmospheric quality that reflects the crime drama aspect of the story brilliantly.Alexandre Desplat also received an Oscar, and with its hauntingly hypnotic and entrancing tones it richly deserved it as to me it was by far the best score of those nominated. Anderson directs superbly, the story balances darkness and quirkiness to great effect (the prison scene is unforgettable) and it's never too simplistic or convoluted (though of course the visuals, dialogue and performances make much more of an impact) and the screenplay is a sublime mixture of the dark, the quirky, the witty and the subtle delivered with rapid-fire.'The Grand Budapest Hotel' boasts an impeccable cast and pretty much everybody does a splendid job, though many of the roles are short. My only criticism of the film is that Harvey Keitel and Saoirse Ronan are underused and just get lost amongst everything else, an unrecognisable Tilda Swinton also has little to do but still gives a bat-out-of-hell performance.Bill Murray, F. Murray Abraham, Jeff Goldblum, Jason Schwartzman and Owen Wilson give very entertaining performances, while Edward Norton is delightfully droll and Adrien Brody and especially Willem Dafoe bring sinister foreboding to the film. Some may say that Tony Revolori is overshadowed by the more experienced cast members (being the only newcomer in a large cast of big names), but to me he more than holds his own and effectively plays it straight. The film belongs to Ralph Fiennes, in what is essentially the heart of the film, while he has always been a fine actor he has not given a performance this brilliant in years, never knew he could be so riotously funny.In conclusion, a wonderful film and a hotel well worth revisiting more than once if to one's taste. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"The Grand Budapest Hotel is the latest from Wes Anderson, and what great fun it is. My review of Monuments Men pointed out that putting the likes of George Clooney, Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett, Jean Dujardin, Bill Murray and Hugh Bonneville in the same film was no guarantee of a good film. Following that logic, what should we make of the following turning up together: Ralph Fiennes, Bill Murray, F. Murray Abraham, Adrien Brody, Willem Defoe, Jeff Goldblum, Jude Law, Edward Norton, Tom Wilkinson, Saoirse Ronan, Owen Wilson and (a wonderfully made up) Tilda Swinton? The answer is a near masterpiece of cameos that add up to a highly entertaining and memorable film.In a complex serious of flashbacks, Tom Wilkinson plays an author remembering his younger self (Jude Law) being recounted, a number of years before, the life story of The Grand Budapest's mysterious elderly guest Zero Moustafa, played by Abraham. (Are you still with me?) Featuring strongly in this life story, Ralph Fiennes plays hotel concierge and lothario Gustave H., seducer of his elderly and wealthy guests. He is supported in this role – for everything outside the bedroom that is – by trainee Bellboy, and Gustave's protégé, Zero (in the younger form of Tony Revolori).Following the murder of one such guest (Tilda Swinton), Gustave is not surprised to feature strongly in her will, awarded a priceless Renaissance painting – Boy with Apple. This is much to the displeasure of her son Dimitri (Adrien Brody) and his evil henchman Jopling (Willem Defoe). What follows is a madcap pursuit across snowy landscapes, various grisly murders, a couple of civil wars, some disconnected fingers, a prison break and a downhill ski chase.All the cast seem to enjoy themselves immensely, but it is the production design and cinematography that really shines through: every single shot of the film is just a joy to look at, from the bright pastel colours of some scenes to the oak-panelled finery of the elderly lady's mansion. Beautifully crafted, beautifully lit,beautifully costumed, beautifully filmed. Bringing a film out so early in the new Oscar-year must be risky: but one can only hope that the voting members have a long enough memory to recognise this movie in these sorts of categories.There are some interesting crossovers to recent films: both 'The Book Thief' and 'The Monuments Men' were filmed – as this was – in Studio Babelsberg in Potsdam. No coincidence then that the steam train chugging through the East European countryside looked startlingly similar to that in the opening scenes of 'The Book Thief'; and if you have Bill Murray and Bob Balaban in town for Monuments Men, then why not stick them together for this film too? Simples! Alexandre Desplat turns up AGAIN with another quirky and fitting score.All in all, if you like the quirky style of films of the likes of Moulin Rouge then you'll love this. Highly recommended.(If you enjoyed this review, please check out my archive of other reviews and while there sign up to ""Follow the Fad""! Thanks!)."
"21 March 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza Tonight - The Grand Budapest Hotel. I really had no idea what this film was about, having seen only one trailer which in the event, bore no relation to the plot whatsoever. However, my interest was piqued so this evening found me watching a splendid little film packed to the rafters with stars. This was the tale of Gustave H, the legendary and infamous Concierge of The Grand Budapest Hotel, a rather glamorous edifice perched atop a mountain and his protégé and most trusted friend Zero, The Lobby Boy. This is a tale of friendship, murder, revenge and deep dark plotting. There were some completely ridiculous moments which were quite refreshing and several, what I like to call Guffaw moments where several members of the audience emit a loud blast of laughter followed by slightly hysterical giggling that you find yourself joining in with. As I said a host of stars in this film ranging from Ralph Fiennes, Jeff Goldblum, Jude Law and Bill Murray to Tilda Swinton, Owen Wilson and Harvey Keitel to name a few, but one of the outstanding performances must go to Tony Revolori, a relatively unknown young actor who plays Zero, who is In almost every scene. An entertaining film, worth watching."
"A wonderfully funny fable of the adventures of world's greatest hotel concierge (a brilliant, inventive and hilarious performance by Ralph Fiennes) and the friendship he strikes up with the hotel's new lobby boy (a strong debut by newcomer Tony Revolori). The story goes in many unexpected directions, every one entertaining and eccentric, and the cast is full of first rate highly comic performances by F. Murray Abraham, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, with terrific cameos by Bill Murray, Harvey Keitel, Edward Norton, Tilda Swinton, Jason Schwartzman, Tom Wilkinson, Owen Wilson, Jude Law and others I feel bad for forgetting here. While not Anderson's most profound film, it may be his most joyful. I don't think I stopped smiling from first frame to last, and I laughed out loud quite a few times. And yet, as in any good fable, there is some real poignancy as well. A top notch marriage of a lovingly crafted art-film and a wacky human comedy, something rarely pulled off with such panache. Even my friends who don't enjoy Anderson's work in general had nothing but good things to say. The sweetest treat of the movie year so far."
"The Grand Hotel Budapest is a zany, colorful and fascinating journey through old postcard Europe, such as only Hollywood can think of. With his old, almost square picture format Wes Anderson pays tribute to recent days, but with the whole movie. In addition to his brilliant humor and endearing characters, this film captures gems with seemingly small details and meticulous compositions. For me, now one of the funniest and most original movies of 2014.The style is unique. You will either like it or you won't. There is no middle ground here.With too many great actors to mention, they all gave outstanding performance that will keep you enchanted."
"After seeing the previews several times, I thought I would enjoy a delightful almost-fantasy-like film. But, at age 64, after going to the movies literally hundreds of times in my lifetime, I did something today that I've only ever done 3 times previously -- I walked out of a movie halfway through the picture. I didn't blame Wes Anderson, because clearly his films have a following...but I thought it must be an acquired taste...that I had not acquired. I admitted that it was a uniquely visually pleasing film, but I wondered why so many fine actors agreed to what were rather small parts. At the time I said that this film bored me even more than ""Moonrise Kingdom"". The the other night it was on cable. I thought I would give it another try, but I fully expected to turn it off at home, also. Perhaps it helped that rather than watch it all in one setting, I broke it into roughly 30 minute segments with breaks in between. Guess what. This time I liked it. I'm not saying I loved it. But I did like it. What did I see this time that I didn't see before. Well, perhaps the tongue-in-cheek attitude of the film. The chance to see Ralph Finnes be downright silly instead of his typical dramatic role. The wonderful photography and special effects. The skill of young actor Tony Revolori. The pleasure of seeing F. Murray Abraham again. And, this time enjoying the many ""cameo"" shots.I still think it dragged on a bit too long (at 100 minutes there are still a few small bits that could have been edited more tightly or even eliminated). And, I'm still not a raving fan of it. But, this time around I did ""like"" it. But it won't end up on my DVD shelf, and I doubt I'll watch it again. But, bravo...good (not great) job!"
"It's gorgeous to look at, often witty, and has a few brilliant casting choices. But two thirds of the way through, the charm wore off.It's not certain now exactly where it started to feel wrong. Maybe it was the nested story within a story within a story; maybe it was the way that the older Zero M. didn't match the appearance of the younger one (the eyes?) Maybe it was the unfortunate things that kept happening to M. Gustav, which were unexpected after seeing the trailers and poster. Maybe it was the shifting accents of the Americans in the cast; Jeff Goldblum started talking about ""Mah-dem"", then switched to ""Mah-dahm"". Maybe it was the that M. Gustave, who is usually quite aware of his surroundings and predicament, was sometimes clueless. When Bill Murray finally made his appearance, nothing special happened. Whatever it was or whenever it happened, it was disappointing."
"A former lobby boy, Zero Moustafaw tells a story to a writer, who tells this tale of a hotel, it's guests and the outstanding concierge Monsieur Gustav H to us. It's about (blind) loyalty, duty beyond the required, greed, stupidity, love for women in any age ... and the power of influence when treating persons with the grace of that person's beauty. It's (black) comedy at its best. The ridiculous becomes brilliant through cleverly constructed dialog, impeccable executed timing and timbre change. Many camera shots are little art pieces like in Moonrise Kingdom, beautifully constructed with cuts that ad to the timing, visually. The production design takes you from the shabby to over-the-top kitsch to breath taking wooden interiors and mountains. The CGI reminds me of Monty Python, deliberately unrealistic which is part of the humor yet makes it at the same time oddly believable.Never thought of Ralph Fiennes as a comedic actor. He convinced me here. Tony Revolori as young Zero Saoirse Ronan as Agatha are remarkable. And then there were: F. Murray Abraham, Jude Law, Tilda Swinton, Adrien Brody, Willem Defoe, Jeff Goldblum, Edward Norton, Léa Seydoux, Harvey Keitel, Tom Wilkinson, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, (I think I saw George Cloony for 2 sec)... Just to be able to get all these heavy weights to sign up for minor roles, demands respect. To get them all set their mark in a few minutes, is awesome.""He retained the illusion with remarkable grace."" is one of the last lines in the movie. It describes both the main character and also the heart of the movie. This is a real 9 - beauty combined with dirt, great cinematography with dry jokes and art with silliness. If you like to be amazed, see something out of the ordinary, are able to go with a flow, you will LOVE this movie."
"An extraordinary cinematic confection and probably Wes Anderson's greatest film. Ralph Fiennes plays the concierge at the Grand Budapest Hotel in the 1930s, which exists in a fictional European country in the Alpine range. He has a habit of keeping some of the old women who stay at the hotel company. When one (Tilda Swinton) leaves him the valuable painting Boy with Apple, Swinton's evil son (Adrien Brody) frames Fiennes for the murder. Fiennes' closest companion, the hotel lobby boy Zero (Tony Revolori), and his girlfriend (Saorsie Ronan) conspire to free Fiennes from prison and sell the painting for loads of money, hopefully enabling them to leave the country, which is being overtaken by fascists. The story isn't much more than fluff (though there is a nice tinge of poignancy), but it's enormously amusing fluff. The highly amusing trailer did give away many of the film's best gags, but this is a laugh a minute movie. The visuals are absolutely delightful. Sure, it's all nothing you haven't seen before from Anderson, but I found it his most perfect accomplishment. The film is loaded with great cameos and little roles (the woman behind me almost had an orgasm when Bill Murray appeared), but my favorite was Willem Dafoe as a toothless heavy."
"Wes Anderson seems to be one of those Directors to look forward to as he has gained a reputation for his quirky eccentricity and stylish flair over the years. In his new film, 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' he tightly weaves together a crime caper that is sharp, witty and slick, but sadly lacks interesting characters.I won't go too far in explaining the plot because a lot happens in the 1 hour and 40 minute running time. The narrative is rather complex as it is handed down from Tom Wilkinson who plays the author who hands the story to his younger self played by Jude Law, who then speaks to Mr Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham) who then tells Jude Law his times of when he got a job as a Lobby Boy at the Grand Budapest Hotel, working for the eccentric perfectionist M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes). We then move from the run down Hotel of that time to the 1930′s when the hotel was booming. We see the hotel in a wedding cake style aesthetic, where anyone who is anyone in the aristocratic world comes to stay, and alt of the time, sleep with Gustave. This includes elderly aristocrat Madame D (An unrecognisable Tilda Swinton). When Madame D dies, she leaves Gustave a priceless painting 'Boy with Apple', to the disgust of Madame D's greedy family, especially her conniving son Dimitri (Adrien Brody). This starts off a chain events which involve lawyers and hit men, an elaborate prison break, a secret society, a woman who hides things in her detailed cakes, and unspecified war and much more.The film looks amazing. It adopts the aesthetic which has become the signature of Wes Anderson films. The perfect framing, the elaborate set design, the costumes matching the sets and all the quirkiness and eccentric deadpan humour to boot. Ralph Fiennes proves to be a fantastic comic lead. His sense of timing and delivery is perfect. Also, his character is very interesting as he initially comes across as a self serving eccentric, but as the film goes on, you realise he has a lot of good in him. Unfortunately, I felt he was the only interesting character in it. Many of the touted cameos which include Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Lea Seydoux, Harvey Keitel, Jeff Goldblum and Willem Dafoe play a small part in the plot, but a lot of them are underused. The talented Saoirse Ronan I felt was particularly underused. The intricate and complicated plot felt tiresome towards the end as so much takes place and the dialogue is so quick and sharp, that if you miss a line, you will miss a big part of the plot. It started to feel too cluttered as there were too many people in it and too much happening. It is still consistently funny and dazzling, but lacked emotional involvement that it felt slightly empty. I think personally, I still pine for Wes Anderson's more melancholic tones of 'The Royal Tenembaums' and 'Rushmore'. In those films, I cared more for the characters and enjoyed the visual and quirky style. I feel his films are drifting towards a more silly and farcical tone, which is fine, but in my opinion I don't feel it is for the better.See my Film Review Blog - www.projectionistreview.wordpress.com"
"Loved it Loved it. Loved it. Beautiful, funny, smart, silly, sad, fantastical. I will probably see this movie at least a dozen more times in my lifetime. Can't wait.Why is there a minimum of 10 lines required to make a review? Weird. Anyway...Ralph Fiennes is wonderful. Could end up being a signature role for him and one that is remembered for some time - although I keep forgetting his character's name. That's a problem.All the usual players show up and their all good to fantastic. Willem Defoe is especially fun. Adrian Brody might be the weakest featured player in the movie. He just doesn't quite seem to match up with the rest of what's going on. Same with Ed Norton, although he's less of a sore thumb. But they aren't problematic for the whole movie. Just very very minor distractions - for me, anyway.I just loved it. So much!"
"Interesting sets, beautifully locations, wooden characters. Too much of the story takes places in trains, a prison and the countryside. I really wish more of the plot had taken place in the hotel. Following a confusing beginning (there is a double flashback), the story took off without any real direction or reason. When the movie ended, many people in the audience applauded. My feeling was ""that's it?"" All the ingredients were there but the cake didn't rise.Still, I'm not sorry I saw the movie. It was different and that's always refreshing in a time of cookie-cutter plots.At one point I noticed that the movie was no longer being shown in widescreen but more of a television aspect ratio. Once the movie returned to 1985 or the present, it was widescreen. Weird."
"Prepare to delve into yet another intentionally bizarre Wes Anderson rabbit hole, guided by no less than three narrators providing flashback upon flashback... And then, somewhere in there, an actual story beginsSkipping to what's really important is Ralph Fiennes as M. Gustave, concierge of the neglected European GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL during the 1930's. He sleeps with spinsters and runs the place with an iron fist – more polished silver than heavy chrome. His young mentoring bus boy, Zero, the one narrating in the form of an aged F. Murray Abraham, sticks to his boss like gum while the duo, like the story, jumps all over the placeAlthough a real plot is chiseled down from a horde of bantering dialogue when an extremely rich woman dies, bringing Gusave to an estate where he could inherit, to the chagrin of her nefarious son, a pricey painting. The first half ends with Gusave and Zero stealing the painting, and the intrigue builds nicely. Then something happens Or perhaps, you can say, too much happens far too soonWhen Gusave is sent to prison, director Anderson abandons his quirky character-driven romp and throws several genre-devices into the pot, including a heavily planned old school prison escape and a ruthless hit man: The latter in the form of motorcycle riding Willem Dafoe, a cross between Steve McQueen and Al Pacino's muggy bodyguard in the second GODFATHER: Dafoe's mobile loon kills anyone connected to Gustave, including pets.There are darkly humorous moments here and here, and always something to gander at, especially the picturesque locations resembling popups from an antique children's book But with so much running around the central plot is all but forgotten, and Ralph Fienne's smug yet endearing gigolo gets lost in a mix of wasted detours and distracting star cameos (including Bill Murray, who could have been played by anyone)And last but not least, with the task of playing the true leading role, young actor Tony Revolori displays the perfect deadpan that befits hipster-friendly art-house fare, but alas, he's not that interesting or, in a movie full of mischievous devils, someone worth rooting for."
I'm surprised by how much I liked this.Totally unexpected.
"I attended this film with my wife and an absolutely packed theatre of moviegoers. My wife fell asleep (literally) and about two hundred others around us sat in uninterrupted silence as a litany of dreary antics and pratfalls ensued. Truthfully, there were no more than a handful of audible giggles throughout the entire length of the film. Personally, I found it mildly humorous at best. One interesting aspect was watching the long list of cameo appearances by so many well-known names, while the story, within a story, within a story narration was mildly intriguing. The chase scene in the snow was insufferably long and cartoonish. Such a disappointment."
"The Grand Budapest Hotel is written and directed by Wes Anderson,starring Ralph Fiennes as a concierge who teams up with one of his employees to prove his innocence after he is framed for murder. This is the premise for the movie, but to watch it was boring. The movie is filmed as if you are watching a play inside a dollhouse, if that makes any sense. The so-called comedy is just pretentious and snob. Of course some people find that funny, but for me it didn't do it. The entire movie didn't do it... It could have been a wonderful adventure, but I found the manner and style it was conceived to be too boring and pointless. The acting is excellent and that saved the movie from being a complete waste of time. This definitely isn't a movie for the masses, and that being said, isn't a movie that an average movie goer will enjoy. For some that's a good thing maybe, but for me this wasn't entertaining. Be your own judge."
"I am probably in a minority when I say that I didn't enjoy this movie, I wanted to like it, the idea seemed sound and the cast is a cavalcade of top notch actors.I am still trying to work out what it was that made me dislike the film, maybe it was the simple fact that there was no plot to speak of, a tenuous vehicle to give the actors a chance to show their stuff. Admittedly the sets were grand (as the name implies), the production company went all out to create this world; and the acting was excellent but there is a problem here too.The problem I found with the acting was that each member the ensemble cast didn't get a fair crack of the whip when it came to showing their stuff. Most of the actors/characters got just a few minutes of time (apart from the leads of course), I wanted more interplay between these actors, surely there was time for that rather than long rambling scenes of inane dialogue.When the film ended I was left with a feeling of ""so what"", I didn't care about the outcome of any of the characters. I am sure that some people will enjoy this but I didn't."
"Having been to a few of Wes Anderson's films, the twee, absurd caricature, dead-pan precious, lush, scenic, cardboard Tim Burton-esque cinematography that many insisted is synonymous with ""intelligent humour"" were all expected. What wasn't is the insufferable, sophomoric idiocy of the story, gratuitous characters and shallowness of the plot, the script, the character development, the entire purpose of the making of this film. What on earth is it suppose to say?! What deeper layers are there to uncover other than it being a madcap caper about promiscuous hotel staff carrying on with obscenely rich geriatrics, murderous villains and relatives, an outrageous and unbelievable jailbreak adventure? What is the point to this wedding cake indulgence of a film, exactly? And please don't sniff haughtily with a ""You just don't get its brilliance/genius/subversion/provocation, blah..blah...blah...go watch a Tom Cruise flick!"" retort. I honestly don't get much more from this film than its gruel thin plot."
"Wes Anderson is undoubtedly one of the finest directors we have working today, and this is very much evident throughout the span of his latest film The Grand Budapest Hotel. His choice of adjusting the screen format, his color pallets and sleek cinematography are what save this movie from being a flop. Yes, it is great directing. Yes the performances, especially Ralph Fiennes, are top notch. This is a decent movie, but decent is where it stops. It doesn't have anything to separate itself from previous quirky and dark humor filled films that Wes Anderson has released, it doesn't have the heart from Moonrise Kingdom, the charisma of The Fantastic Mr. Fox, or the mystique from The Darjeeling Limited. Yes, every director may have their own styles and tweak it differently for each of their works, but Wes Anderson only adds some minor plot differences to his films to make them slightly ""different,"" yet still far too similar. I have been fine with them in the past, but by The Grand Budapest Hotel, his fourth main entry, the goofy style becomes a little tedious and actually difficult to get through in some scenes. Many trivial things are presented as important matter in drawn out sequences, making it all the more difficult to watch. Yes, I am harshly bad mouthing this movie, but I did still find some enjoyment in watching the gorgeous film making and the once in while funny script, but come the third act, all the twists just become much too predictable, and ultimately unsatisfying. I hope Wes Anderson has something up his sleeve that can add variety into his collection, because my patience level for this is slowly declining. GRADE: C"
"I am shocked how well this movie has done among IMDb users and critics. The cast is amazing, but the movie is truly terrible. I walked out of Rushmore and would have done the same here. The characters were annoying, the dialog pointless and I was just waiting for it to end. Bleh.I did not understand why any of the characters acted the way the did. The little cuts that Anderson employees so freely for dramatic effect just seemed pointless. There was a sequence where there were cuts between different hotel managers that was funny through two cuts and then just dragged on and on as each manager had to stop what he was doing and put his Boy in charge. That is this movie in a nutshell -- it dragged on and on. That could have been interesting to see how a whole network of hotel managers could have been activated, but it just ends up being pointless."
"Having lost almost 2 hours of my life watching this pretentious, awkward, tedious,repetitive nonsense masquerading as a film, I felt an urgent need to warn my fellow movie goers of this stinker of a movie.The Great Budapest Hotel is ""in your face"" director's overindulgence in experimenting. It lacks even pretense of trying to tell an entertaining story. Its caleidoscope of disjointed themes crawls, mostly sideways, with the dreadful quality of a nightmare.One might fall into a trap of wishing to explore the latest ""oeuvre"" of a ""cult"" director/screenwriter. For those of you be warned, you'll need a strong motivation to sit through this indulgent mush of an experiment in viewers' goodwill.The one star goes for some striking images which ""do not a movie make""."
"I can barely bring myself to write a summery of plot. I gave up paying attention after 15 minutes. A hotel employee is framed for the murder of one of the frequenters but none of it is actually essential to the filming of a project that most likely appeals to Wes Anderson fans only. With a pinch of 30's slapstick here and a steal from Burton there, one finds himself a hostage for 2 hours having already paid the admission fee. Familiar faces come and go as the ridiculous and overbearing Anderson antics occupy the screen. Repetition is not a problem here. The jokes are funny only when on certain drugs and the story a mere vehicle that could have been about a snowflake falling in love with a cloud if it would provide the required running time and the opportunity to set a handsome decor. Though Fiennes gives us one of his best performances to date, I wouldn't recommend this juvenile exercise in self-indulgence to anyone."
"I had great hopes for this film, I liked the previous titles of the director, and mostly, find him imaginative and cheerful. Also, this film featured a lot of good actors, and even Bill Murray!.But it falls short, it's not really funny. There are a lot of dialogs, that try to be fast and brilliant, but they get tiring after a while. There are a bunch of repetitive jokes, that are not funny. I was really expecting to laugh, and you know that feeling when you are trying to laugh on a film, but it doesn't deliver. Seems like the visuals, while powerful, were meant to be the main part of the comedy. But they don't really add a sense of comedy. Not even the hotel is an important piece of the history. Maybe I was expecting it to be a comedy, but that was not the intention of the director?And then, the just mere circumstantial appearance of Mr Murray."
"In contrast to other reviewers, I am quite disappointed of this film. It is a rather weak comedy aimed at a British/American audience with limited knowledge of Central Eastern Europe's cultures and languages - and its bare content may therefore appear exotic and hilarious. The whole actually resembles Swedish comedy movies from the 80s, but with modern aesthetics.The weakest link is the script and especially the dialog. The film starts of in an extreme tempo, as fashionable nowadays, probably not to risk boring any potential young and inexperienced viewers, maybe to appear smart and fresh - with the consequence of the audience losing half of what is going on. The extraordinarily many famous actors do not reach anywhere to potential - instead it seems like squeezing in as many stars as possible in roles that do not offer full scope for their talent.The second character, Zero Moustafa, as young played by an Indian-looking (apparently Latino) actor, as old by a white Caucasian (why?), may ring fresh with current political news for a British/American audience as he is a refugee who has had to leave his home country due to war - and due to this fact the constant nonsense-speaking Gustave excuses himself for a ""racist"" remark. And then they run around lightly clad in the snow together for much of the rest of the movie. For me, not finding anything funny, the only joy is the great cinematography, the photo and the music. The whole show is certainly wrapped in luxury paper - it feels like a waste with such weak content. But dollar-wise it might still be a success"
"Never did i think that i would ever be enough intrigued by the awfulness of movie to create an account just to write a review about it. I can't possibly understand how some people would ever enjoy such a movie. So boring and lacking an interesting story. Let alone the fact that its not even funny! I felt sorry for the crowd watching the movie with us, i could feel the pain in their eyes and i could hear the prayers inside their heads hoping that the movie gets better! I mean come on look at it's high rating! It must be good, i will get better, it should! But it never did. I usually appreciate the ""artsy"" side of movies, but this one i couldn't even swallow it. And don't even get me started with the horrible animated scenes. As an animator, it felt like poison to my eyes!"
"I don't know that I'd call ""The Grand Budapest Hotel,"" Wes Anderson's latest bit of whimsy, exactly a misfire, but I certainly didn't like it as much as some of his other recent films.Almost always there's a strong emotional core to Anderson's films that anchors the idiosyncratic absurdity that defines his style. But that emotional core is missing in this film, leaving us with a slew of Anderson creations, cartoonish characters that don't engage us because they're not given time to. His film is stuffed with famous names, some of them Anderson regulars, some of them new to his world, but virtually all of them are given short shrift. I was excited when, for example, Jason Schwartzman made his entrance, because he's been given the opportunity in previous Anderson movies to make such a comedic impression, but he gets about two minutes of unremarkable screen time before the story whisks on to the next disposable character. It's the first Wes Anderson film I can think of that caused me to actually be annoyed by his self conscious style, a sure sign that in other respects Anderson was off his game.I should add, though, that Ralph Fiennes is sensational. His performance is the one thing about the film I can praise without reservation.Grade: B"
Wes Anderson must have been high as a kite when making this film. The onslaught of colour and the architecturally questionable locations could only have been thought to be a good idea by someone who has just consumed a truckload of industrial strength LSD. Frankly watching the mentally unstable characters bounce around the screen was an experience I can only compare to being repeatedly hit in the face with a sock full of sick. The music was only comparable to listening to someone urinate on a cat and the script seemed like something that would spring from the mind of a dog sat at a typewriter.Ralph Fiennes was pretty good though.
"I think some moviegoers wrote positive reviews of this horrid picture just to show they belong to some intellectual elite, which they do not. (Written by graduate of a ""name"" law school, with an M.A. and Ph.D. in political science, not to brag, just to show I am not particularly dumb.)I lost so much interest in this boring debacle that I almost walked out--I have, literally, never come close to doing that with any movie before, and I see at least 10 or so a month.In the hands of a Woody Allen, it might have been tolerable, but not so here.I am glad it was a box office no-show,despite its appealing name. Thank God some people apparently spread the word of how bad it truly is."
"This is the first Wes Anderson movie I've ever watched, and given it's supposed to be its masterpiece, I think it will be the last one. In fact, I could just stand to watch half of it, and decided it wasn't worth wasting the rest of my time so just read the rest of the argument.When I watch a movie, I wanted to have some emotion behind it, and to teach me something. The reason why didn't like this movie (and probably, Wes Anderson's particular style) is that I felt there was nothing in it besides its visuals, this perfectionist shots and stiff way of acting. All the scenes look alike, and all actors act in the same way: stiff, inexpressive. It didn't seem funny to me at any point.Even if the plot made up for it (which is based on a book by Zweig), the execution of the film just spoils it. This very plastic, very materialistic outlook of the movie, with an obsession with this beautiful visuals, just seems a way for the author to conceal the shallowness of the movie."
"This is a tediously irritating, messy, pretentious and boring film which utilizes extremely uninteresting characters that rely on the 'weird' Wes Anderson humor/pacing (which I don't mind if what they where saying or doing was actually funny or had substance) in order to appear relevant as a character, in a VERY uninteresting story that keeps jumping from one line to another every 4 minutes.
The lobby boy was particularly awful. There was absolutely nothing special or endearing about him wich would make me believe that the main character would get attached to him. Which actually seemed to had happened from one second to another and for no particular reason.
Also, something that contributed to make me take the story less seriously was the casting of Murray Abraham as the adult version of a latin boy. It's like casting Beyonce to play the adult version of Elle Fanning. Just plain bizarre."
"I don't see what all the hype is about. I went into this film with no expectations: --Didn't have a clue what it was about. --Hadn't seen any trailers. --Heard it was a fast paced satirical comedy.Really I felt this movie was pointless. Half way through the film I kept wishing I had gone to see something else. I chuckled a few times, but overall I was bored. It didn't draw me in. I wasn't emotionally involved in the story.Perhaps the fanfare with all the celebrity appearances is what had a particularly nice appeal to others, but I am not impressed with celebrity faces.This is the first time that a film that scored a high IMDb rating has disappointed me. I am puzzled at the disparity.I cannot recommend this film. I thought it was a waste of my time and money."
"What a waste of time and money. A cartoon type of film. Actor dialogue was rapid pace and hard to follow at times. It appeared to me that there was a lot of models used in lieu of locations. Went with another couple who were really upset since I based my recommendation of seeing this movie on comments made by reviewers. One seldom heard any laughter in the theater and when you did, it seemed contrived. The film attempted to capture the 1920 film making style but truly missed the mark. I saw some reviews liken the film to Around the World but it was not even close in capturing that flavor.Better off staying away from this dull piece of work. I think the producers must have paid a lot of folks to submit reviews because I really can't believe so many saw value in this corny flick."
"Watched the entire movie, and really have nothing great to say about it. It did not catch any attention, the script is mundane, it is definitely over-hyped. It tries to come off as something very special, and with complex narrative, by creating this beautiful atmosphere, but delivers nothing to me. Honestly, 2 hours wasted. I did not find the movie philosophical or in any way profound."
"Bloody terrible. It seems that IMDb's ratings are always a disappointment when looking for a new movie. I was so bored, unmoved and unamused by this film that I almost fell asleep watching it. I've only ever had that happen once in my life and that was being dragged to see Pink Panther 2 so I'm certain you can weigh up just how terrible and how much I hated this film. My partner wasn't so lucky and began to snore just before the half way point. This movies ratings are based solely on artificial popularity and by that I mean it's rated like a branded hoody: extremely over priced, over RATED and of the same quality as primark. I feel as if nearly an hour of my life has been wasted and I will never get that back."
"I avoided this movie when it came out, since the last two films I've seen of director Wes Anderson, The Light Aquatic and the Darjeeling Limited, were utterly terrible. Only with the recent multiple Oscar nominations of this movie, I decide to give this a chance. And guess what: it is a great movie, his best since the Royal Tennenbaums. Set mostly in the 1930s in a fictional Central European state (the film was mostly shot in Southern Germany) - though with a nifty introduction from the 1960s that frames the narrative with Jude Law and F. Murray Abraham - the Grand Hotel Budapest tells the story of the said hotel - one in the classical European style - that is run by the concierge M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) helped by the bellboy Zero (Tony Revolori)Fiennes is great as Gustave, a cultured, suave womanizer specialized in wooing elderly ladies who sees himself as a beacon of civilization in an age of increasing barbarism. When one of his ""customers"" (Tilda Swinton) dies and decides to give part of her inheritance to Mustafa, her two psycho sons (Adrien Brody and Willem Dafoe) will left no stone unturned in trying not to give others what they think is rightfully theirs.This movie has an impressive all star cast. Along with those already named, we also have Edward Norton, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Saoirse Ronan, Mathieu Amalric and (in smaller roles), Bill Murray, Lea Seydoux, Owen Wilson and Jason Schwartzmann. And Anderson's mannerisms and eccentricities are not so off putting here (well, maybe with exceptions, like what does the mole with the size of Mexico in Saoirse Ronan means?). Inspired by the writings of Stefan Zweig."
"After reading on line that this was up for an Oscar and saw the many celebrities in the cast I was anxious to see this film. I think I laughed once during the entire film. Maybe I am dense or maybe I am the wrong nationally to enjoy this flick, but I just didn't get it. I actually fell asleep I was so bored. I was very disappointed as I love Ralph Fiennes but I felt this role was totally beneath him. Also the portrayal of a main character when he was older was totally off...confused me terribly. I did however enjoy the scenery thought it was beautifully done. Perhaps I should read the book and then I would understand exactly what was going on. Again it bored me, I was waiting for something exciting to happen and I felt as though it never did."
"I was dragged to this film without any prior knowledge of it. I accepted the challenge (as sometimes I have been introduced to some of my most favorite films in this very manner) and went to the theater with my friends accordingly.The film is done in typical Wes Anderson fashion - lavish sets with dark, almost dreary colors that appear as though they were designed in the 1940s and 1950s, quirky characters with weird pasts, and a strange plot that doesn't really reveal itself until the end of the film.One of my major struggles with Wes Anderson's style is that oftentimes he makes the characters so quirky that you don't really feel anything for any of them. This film falls into that very same tragic issue. While I liked Ralph Fiennes character Gustave, I simply didn't care about him in the slightest. Zero was the token ""normal"" character that Wes Anderson throws into the mix, and unfortunately he was so contrastingly normal that I didn't even want to see him on the screen. The myriad of cameos in the film were delightful for the moments they occurred, but as the film went on those characters were easily forgotten.Now don't get me wrong, I love quirky characters, but I prefer them to be realistically quirky in a manner where calling attention to that quirkiness causes me to shake my head or squirm in my seat from embarrassment. A great example of this is the set of characters in Napoleon Dynamite, and even Wes Anderson's The Fantastic Mr Fox. However, the characters in Grand Budapest Hotel did not behave in a realistic manner.In typical Wes Anderson fashion, the film lacked any real laugh-out-loud moments. The theater remained pretty quiet throughout the film, and people oftentimes chuckled at different moments. I, unfortunately, fell victim to my friend looking at me at moments he thought was funny and giving me that ""why aren't you giggling too"" look.Giving high marks to a Wes Anderson film is always a difficult chore for me, even when I truly enjoy one of his films. I'm saddled by the fact that I really don't ever feel like I would seek out to watch a film of his a second time, and Grand Budapest Hotel certainly leaves me with no desire to watch it again. This film isn't a bad one by any means, but I wouldn't consider it a great one either. To me, it falls into the average category - watchable, but not re-watchable."
"I admire the effort and meticulous planning that goes into his scenes. It's a breath of fresh air to see a director take passion in the colour palette of a film and stylise it so. However, what happens to your actors when they can only walk either vertically or horizontally? It becomes flat. I get the overwhelming impression that Anderson has planned his scenes so much so that there is absolutely no spontaneity. I think this is probably the most frustrating film I have ever seen, mainly because of the amount of effort that has gone into it but the lack of exploration given to the actors over arches the entire production. It's close, but miles off at the same time. I literally had to turn it off half way through after the 100th symmetrical scene or a shot in profile / head on. What had happened to exploring the 3 dimension world the film is shot in. I actually feel like within 30 minutes his direction becomes lazy and he has forgotten what the emotion of film is all about. Incredible scenes are lost because of the direction being so caught up in its own aesthetic. It's almost like watching Pac man for 2 hours. Shame, obviously a great script."
"I have given this film 1/10, only because it is not possible to rate it zero. I don't know why I never learn: ever since Rushmore, a film to which I simply could not warm up, every time I watch one of Wes Anderson's films, I end up disliking it intensely. That was the case with Rushmore, then The Royal Tennenbaums, followed by Moonrise Kingdom, and now The Grand Budapest Hotel. Two of my good friends, whose judgment in films I trust, told me what a great film this was. With that in mind, I began watching it, but within 20 minutes, I realized I would not like the film, just as I had not enjoyed watching the other Anderson films before. One reason was the manic pace at which the actors delivered their lines and the musical score rolled; another was how completely indifferent to their predicaments the characters left me. The Grand Budapest Hotel is a pretentious film, in which visual style stifles any substance its talented actors might have brought to the story."
"I hadn't heard of this film when I and my wife decided to watch it on Sky a couple of days ago and I was stunned when I heard today it was up for multiple Oscars.We couldn't make it past about 40 minutes - it literally did nothing for us at all. It just seemed dull, awkward and a bit too arty at the expense of plot.I don't mind films starting slow and laying the foundations for the characters and the plot. But this film just didn't appear to be offering me any incentive to stick with it.Maybe we were missing something. Or maybe this is one of those films you're supposed to like even if you don't"
"So, here I am again after trusting the IMDb rating only to be disappointed. Does this movie deserve the 1 star rating that I have given it? No. Does it deserve the bloated hyped 8.4? No. This movie is a 6. However I feel as though I owe to the IMDb community to help balance the rating.I was looking forward to this movie, excitedly anticipating it's release date. Visually, this movie had it all, which is what you would expect from a Wes Anderson movie, however, it did not have anything else. It was almost as though we are expected to be satisfied by just that. Don't get me wrong, I love and cherish most of his works. I mean Moonrise Kingdom has to be one of my all time faves..and Fantastic Mr Fox's genius screenplay will always be my cussing fave. But this movie felt empty, it lacked something. You cannot churn out the same visual beauty every time and expect the same hype, there needs to be innovation, whether it is visually, via screenplay or plot. This is what upsets me, there was no innovation. Without innovation there's nothing new, the punchlines are few and far in between, the plot was boring and character's were not well rounded.Maybe the money that should have been spent developing the above was spent sending armies of people to bloat this rating. I don't know. I will not jump on this ""It's a Wes Anderson movie so I have to love it"" bandwagon. That's my rant over. Until next time!"
"I gather that I was supposed to be thrilled by the ""artful"" use of color, costumes and props--especially color--in this production. And I did find it pleasant for what it was worth. It was also fun spotting celebrity cameos in nearly every scene. They were everywhere! A sort of ""Where's Waldo?"" in film form, with the hidden characters being Hollywood stars. The budget of this film must have been astronomical. But is it a great work of art?I am afraid that I disagree with the reviewers who are raving about The Grand Budapest Hotel. It was somewhat fun to watch, but the story, let us be frank, is rather banal and a weird mishmash of genres. Some may call that ""high art"" but to me it is more like a big glob of clichés from all of the different genres mixed together into one big pot. A mystery? A comedy? A romance? A drama? A slasher crime film (Dafoe plays a psycho professional killer)?This creation ends up being a lot of color and good props and an exercise in style, but it lacks the overall coherence and brilliance of a masterpiece. Star power and style are good, of course, but they do not alone suffice.Would I watch this film a second time? Probably not."
"I for one haven't recovered from the dissonance between this movie's rating on IMDb and my own viewing experience. Maybe my expectations were too high because of the rating? It's one of those things that you like it if you like it (circular argument, but that's exactly my point). Many of the rave reviews I now realize come from Wes Anderson connoiss-fans.The positives: it is a feast of visual surrealism; it's a virtual fireworks of movie mega-stars that make for a dazzling show. But when the smoke clears, there's not much left. Decent entertainment, but neither brilliant comedy nor sophisticated satire. The cast of the movie would have been capable to deliver either in spades, but the script and direction fell short."
Rented on video and nearly switched off. Don't know what the fuss is all about. Didn't like Moonrise Kingdom either. Rubbish. How this type of film wins a Golden Globe confirms either I am completely out of touch or the awards are. Not seen Birdman but put off by the fact it won a Golden Globe. Saw a useless film starring Brad Pitt called Tree of Life or something similar. Waste of money producing. Then again Shakespeare in Love and Ordinary People won Oscars for best movie. Seem to remember Forrest Gump beat Pulp Fiction. Wes Anderson films are not for me. Pretentious drivel. Rather watch Wes Craven and that's saying something.
"When I came to the theater to watch the movie, I had no preconceived expectations about it. 20 minutes into the movie I realized that it was not a movie made for large audiences, but rather a movie created to please the sensibilities of those that view life in a peculiar way. It reminded me of ""The Big Lebowski"" and ""Adaptation,"" which have their own cult following.The movie does rely on a superb cast of actors that won't disappoint any moviegoer; but the problem with the movie is the story itself. In a unique way, it rehashes old themes of greed, intolerance, and obsession with the material world. It helps perpetuate the notion that humanity is flawed and that life has no ultimate purpose. It seems to reinforce those sensibilities generated or amplified explicitly and implicitly by individualistic life choices and humanistic thoughts within the confines of the human experience.Artistically, it lacks the complete range of human emotions necessary for a wholesome movie. Nevertheless, in an uncanny way, it would certainly connect with those that already made up their minds about the meaning of life in a subtle and reaffirming manner."
"I saw this movie this evening with a feeling of anticipation. After ""Moonrise Kingdom"" (my own personal Anderson favorite), I was somewhat skeptical that he could top my favorite, and my skepticism was justified. It was colorful, and had quite a few laughs, but that's about it. A lot of actors were quite simply under-used. Tilda Swinton had so little to do that a simple portrait of her would have sufficed. Bill Murray with his oh-so-obvious American accent was totally out of place. I suppose if I had read the works of Stefan Zweig, I might have enjoyed this movie more than I did. But then there's the possibility that I wouldn't have enjoyed Zweig either. Over the years, I have come to judge movies by whether or not I would want to view it more than once, and perhaps purchase a copy of it. I have a copy of ""Moonrise Kingdom"" which I have viewed a number of times. It is part of small collection that I like to watch on occasion. Sadly, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" will never be part of this collection."
"Strip the harsher bits of the language and a few brief graphics, and all you have is a children's story. Add the language and graphics back, and you have a film suitable for nobody.Visually, it's quite bold, but like the scripting, it suffers from not knowing when less is more. I felt like shouting ""shut the frack up"" so many times, there were so many words with so little positive contribution to my experience. Some of the less gaudy imagery, and the skillful integration of the music with the visuals, was quite Greenaway-ish, but please forget I mentioned a visionary like that in the context of tripe like this.Editing was painfully cartoonish. Plot was about as complex as a typical children's cartoon too. Pretentious visual masturbation, not even particularly well done, to be honest - you can see the joins. Best left on Wes Anderson's Kleenex, not my wall.Oh dear, I've just found out that this was supposed to be a ""comedy"". A few bits of slapstick does not a comedy make. Extreme drugs required in order to get any giggles out of this."
"Wes Anderson is pretty much the kind of director who never betrays his cinematic trademark no matter how small and unconventional it looks. Just like most of his films, the style and personality are written all over it, from aesthetics to pizazz, but compare this to the others, The Grand Budapest Hotel crafts something that is nearly otherworldly which (obviously) makes it very charming. It is a part thriller and part comedy film that is perfectly coated by its artistic panache, but looking deep within the structure, you may also find a bunch of witty humor and rich character development from the two leads which makes it a really special experience.The film is actually a set of layered events telling how many generations have reached the story of the past hotel owner, Gustave H. That strange piece of intro immediately presents the endless creativity of the picture. Some might think it's unnecessary, but it gives a lot of sense when the final title card appears, pretty much sums up the purpose of that period jump. But it doesn't stop there, of course. The whole film is an amusing multi-genre adventure that takes you to whimsically designed places. Even when it hits to the suspenseful moments, it still sticks to the lightheartedness until every color fades into black and white. It's a quite sophisticated direction, anything else is a pure delight.The aesthetics are an undeniable visual feast. You couldn't ask for anything more than that, the film adds plenty of quirky action within this fabulous looking world. The perfect blend of buddy comedy, mystery, and suspense is all what you need for this platform video game looking environment. But then, it's not complete without the joys of the characters. The real shining moments here is the relationship between Gustave H. and Zero. Ralph Fiennes is wondrous to the role. He made Gustave H. a very likable fellow in spite of his obvious insecurities and selfishness. But then it's an overall compelling performance. Tony Revolori also shines as his apprentice. The misfit pair sparks chemistry that adds more color to this already colorful world. The rest of the cast are just equally terrific at they are doing, whether it's to deliver great humor or give a lot of life in each scene.The Grand Budapest Hotel is often manic yet (obviously) often creative and witty. It's all classic stuff: it suddenly creates a captivating universe where its imaginations are free to express endlessly. I mean it even ends with an animated dance at the credits. Everything is not a surprise from the director, however it is still kind of a refreshing cinema. Because definitely it has larger than life painted exteriors, delightful characters, brilliant humor, and smart filmmaking that do not always exist in your everyday entertainment. It's just a fun caper that is easy to love, no matter if your interests to movies is mainstream or art-house."
"""The Grand Budapest Hotel"", Wes Anderson's most successful film to date, is visually enthralling, every frame a veritable art museum painting (and not just on the level of ""Boy with Apple""), cleverly utilizing glass-paintings and CGI-enhanced locations in Germany and Poland actually to the level of picture postcards. That may also be its problem. As interesting as the film would seem to be theoretically, it seems as hollow and superficial as a picture postcard. Its extraordinary cast members (which includes 11 previous Oscar nominees and 5 Oscar winners) posture themselves like mannequins throughout a fast-paced exercise that feels no deeper than an elaborate puppet show. Admittedly, I've had a long-term aversion to Anderson's 'style', so annoying in its contrived stance of false naiveté. While overwhelmed by the beauty in every sequence, I search in vain for the least empathy with a single character and any emotion beyond the superficial. Many swoon over this film, but its adoration to me makes more sense on a sociological level in sync with the Twitter and Instagram sound-bite age we live in. As I said to a good friend (who's a Wes Anderson fan) after we left the theater, ""How could anyone spend so much money on such a marvelous cast and such gorgeous images and produce something so shallow and emotionless?"" I'm still waiting for the answer."
"Although I don't consider myself a Wes Anderson fan, and I can't stand Tilda Swinton, Bill Murray or any of the Wilson brothers, the reviews of this movie were distinctive enough to get it into my otherwise empty DVD rental queue - but only because there were no other movies that I actually wanted to see.Now that I've seen it, I'm still not a Wes Anderson fan, and I still can't stand Tilda Swinton, et al - and now I also don't like people I've liked in the past, like Jason Schwartzman, Ralph Fiennes, Murray Abraham and Tom Wilkinson. Only Jude Law has emerged unscathed. Every time I see him I like him more.Wes Anderson has legions of ardent, devoted, cult-like fans, but I'm not one of them. His stuff just bores and annoys me, and his favorite actors are among the ones I most dislike even in other directors' movies."
"First, this is billed as a comedy. At the showing we saw, nobody laughed. At all. Nobody. The only reason I did not rate this lower was that there were a lot of fine actors portraying their roles with skill. Unfortunately, the characters are two-dimensional, the plot is silly at best, and even the cinematography is frequently cartoonish. There were whole scenes that were amateurishly animated. Many lines that I think were supposed to be shocking just came off dumb. Having funny stuff going on in the background can be a great device when used with skill, such as in Police Squad or even Mad Magazine, but then the background stuff has to actually be funny. None of this movie was. I'm sorry I paid money for this film, but even if it had been free I still resent the waste of time."
"I've really enjoyed some of Anderson's films, and even ""Moonrise Kingdom,"" which wasn't good, had some thought-provoking qualities. This one, by contrast, was awful, and to me it suggests he has become ""full of himself"" or is ""mailing it in."" It's not funny, nor insightful, nor compelling on any level. At the very beginning, the worn, 1960s decor was amusing, and overall I got the sense that this was going to be about a small number of ""quirky"" hotel guests in the mid 1980s. These were people who were trapped in the past, but didn't know how to move forward because they had enough money to keep them at the ""luxury resort hotel."" I was really looking forward to that kind of presentation, but instead we are then taken to another flashback !We are then introduced to a ""lobby boy"" and a hotel manager (who is ""full of himself"" and rather unappealing) who are living during the heyday of the hotel, several decades earlier. Now I'm thinking that this still might be about quirky hotel guests, but of a different period, and seen through the eyes of these two (or at least one of them). Instead, the film degenerates into a ridiculous plot about the manager (Fiennes) being framed for murder, then plotting to escape, then trying to clear his name. Not long after he does this, he is killed by Nazi-like soldiers (why couldn't they be actual Nazi soldiers?). The lobby boy's wife dies in childbirth, along with the child, for no good reason, and we have to be told that this happens - we don't see the lobby boy and his wife as a married couple (so there is no character development).There are a few crude jokes, and several murders, one of a cat that seemed like it was something from a ""Beavis and Butthead"" episode. Overall, this was a very unpleasant cinematic experience, and even the special effects, which tried to create a cute and ""magical"" atmosphere, did not fit in well - some were used over and over again, to the point of being irritating. If you are not going to create realistic characters, then there needs to be something compelling. The special effects certainly don't make up for this shortfall, as can be the case in action or sci-fi movies, nor is there anything in the plot that works, such as an elaborate murder mystery. It's not even a ""feel good"" film with a message about ""personal redemption"" or ""doing the right thing.""Now I'm all for ""dark"" films about subjects like ""losing faith"" (which often contain insights one can't help but ponder), yet you're not going to get anything like that here either! As my title suggests, this is a bizarre ""cute"" yet mean and nasty effort, and I gave it an extra star because it's outright weird, conceptually. I was not impressed by ""Moonrise Kingdom,"" but I think I understood the ""coming of age"" idea behind it; with this film, I am left wondering what Anderson was trying to accomplish. If you enjoy this film, that's fine with me, though I have no idea what you could have found compelling or humorous, but if you think it's some sort of contribution to the history of cinema, I think you would benefit from taking some college courses on this subject. If you are a fan of old, silly-looking decor, go ahead and watch the first ten minutes, but after that, I can't imagine what anyone could enjoy about it, other than a few seconds here or there."
"I didn't check the spoiler box, because in order to spoil the plot, there would have to be a plot.Imagine, if you will, a parody of Wes Anderson films. It's impossible because that's what he does.There's no plot because he doesn't need one and it would be unnecessary anyway. There's no character development because the usual suspects are already there and his celebrity cameo players have already established their characters.Yes there are funny parts, but after the first half hour you've seen all of them and the rest is just tedious.If you are a Wes Anderson fan, you will love this, if not stay away because this has all been done before."
"As with RUSHMORE, DARJEELING, MOONRISE KINGDOM, ZISSOU, etc., GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is all style, no substance. I would say it's cinema for cinema's sake, but this isn't even cinematic, it's just desperately visual. There are zero ideas. Every scene strikes the same note. The characters are mannered and empty of interest. There's some visual wit, but almost no verbal wit. Wes Anderson, the mysteriously admired director, seems to have gotten all his skills from watching sketch comedy on TV. Weird people, weird situations, weird visuals-- that seems to be enough for him. He uses an inner circle of friends/ actors, and often chooses to feature people who aren't even actors in lead roles (that includes the expressionless Jason Schwartzman who, happily for the audience, has only a minor role in this film). Actors who really need direction, e.g. Edward Norton and Adrien Brody, languish in Anderson's hands.As for plot and content: If Anderson is aware of what Central Europe was like as Hitler rose to power, he shows no indication of it beyond the trappings-- costumes, set design, both of which are very good, as is the music. Indeed, Alexandre Desplat's score provides the only feeling the movie has. GRAND BUDAPEST is superficial from the first frame to the last-- and an insult to Stefan Zweig. If you see it, watch for the fake Egon Schiele painting, ""Two Lesbians Masturbating,"" and ask yourself, why? Why that subject? My guess: because Schiele is still, almost 100 years after his death, a radical painter-- an adjective Anderson would like applied to himself, though he is really only pretentious, delivering well-funded displays of superficial eye candy."
"The trailer for this film enticed me to see it. The film was, however, a total let-down and may well be the worst film I have ever seen.The plot was almost non-existent. It certainly had no sense nor direction.The film rambled through a series of mostly boring events punctuated by a liberal dose of expletives that added nothing whatsoever to any aspect of the film except to place it in the smut and filth category.The author must have been high on something when he wrote this one. Unfortunately whatever high he was on, did nothing to make this film worth viewing."
"I came to the cinema like a client promised the most wonderful menu at a 3 star Michelin restaurant.It was truly an absolutely visual feast but alas as much as I pushed the offering around my plate I found nothing by the time the credits rolled..From the opening establishing shot of the impossibly located Grand Hotel Budapest to the self indulgent and utterly pointless dialogue I had to wonder how on earth did wonderful artists become involved in the folly of The Grand Hotel.. What on earth were they doing in this self indulgent piece of nonsense.Anna Pinnock as the Set Decorator as usual came to the plate and did the most incredible work but I felt like a duck being prepared for the Pate menu... Sorry Mr Anderson and all those reviewers who have been taken in by the Emperors' new clothes... Such a waste of great talents from artists to designers etc..etc..I can only add that like all great artists there has to be a detractor or two and I do not consider this man to be a great artist just overly self indulgent... Imagination ,invention, does not a genius make.If I had felt in need of visual stimulation there are endless museums and galleries I can visit beginning with Tate Modern. What a waste of 90 minutes or so .It felt like a lifetime ...What a waste of the considerable budget!!"
"If you go to see Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Jeff Goldblum, Jude Law, Tilda Swinton, or Tom Wilkinson then you'll be disappointed. Their parts are something less than cameos and really don't give them an opportunity to do their thing.What was great about The Life Aquatic was its spoof of Jacques Cousteau and his milieu, something specific and real to bounce the comedy off of. The Grand Budapest Hotel has no real-world anchor and thus it's just a silly farcical story. The self-important concierge, M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) takes himself, his position, and his hotel way too seriously. How much funnier it would have been had there been some real-world character to set Gustave against.The film is set ambiguously in 1930s Europe, even the Nazi thugs are ambiguous; their SS insignia looks like the scribble of a lazy physics professor. The special effects are period too. There's a chase scene on skis and sled that is ridiculously low-tech. How much funnier it would have been if there was something real world to measure it against like Cousteau's 1970s seat-of-the-pants, do-it-yourself science in the hands of Bill Murray.Then there is the fictional bakery, Mendl's, whose cakes and confections try to be funny, but suffer from the same lack of a real-world counterpoint. It just doesn't carry the comic weight of Bill Murray's ship the Belafonte in Life Aquatic because there is no Calypso to measure it against. For those of you who don't know, Calypso was Cousteau's real-world research vessel. The comic jolt comes when you realize that Harry Belafonte was a famous calypso singer back then. It's brilliant little details like that, that made me roar at Life Aquatic but that are sorely lacking in Budapest."
"I don't care for Wes Anderson. Every time trailers give me the impression it's going to be funny, I'm deeply disappointed. For me, Wes Anderson's works range from stupid to really stupid. Grand Budapest Hotel is typically stupid. What makes it a little better is the true humor of the sets and costumes. From the Easter egg candy colored hotel with delightful columns, a grand stair-step tram to raise visitors to the heights of the hotel's entrance, delightful hotel staff costumes and villains costumed in traditional black, this Wes Anderson did give this viewer one arena of entertainment that the rest, acting, story (what story?), plot (what plot?), characterizations (who cared about any of them?) lacked. I did enjoy the stellar cast. I think they do Wes Anderson's films because making them must be fun. My favorite of the cast? Jeff Goldblum. I liked his character. And his was the only character about whom I had any feeling for care or concern.Will I ever watch a Wes Anderson film? Yes, but only for the reason I dragged myself through it this time-- it was on the IMDb 250 top films list on the 31st of December. For those who like Wes Anderson, your sense of comedy is different from mine, not better, just different. As for me, I think I'll go back to Woody Allen films."
"I feel sorry for the operators and all the other technicians that were recruited to produce this visually excellent picture about nothing. The script is so empty and devoid of any sense whatsoever that it made me question the emptiness I constantly feel inside my own life, and convince me that my life is actually full of wonder and magic compared to the dullness of this film's script. Wes Anderson must have indeed been on drugs. This movie is pure trash."
"I was very disappointed. At points I thought it could have been a good film; good actors, good decor, seemingly reasonable budget. With such a high rating I expected a decent film, however, it is lacking in suspense and excitement, as in my opinion the most intense or interesting parts of the film are made light of, making it rather monotonous. The story and the film in general after the first 45 minutes or so became rather boring to the extent I would have got up and left had I been alone. There is no real connection with the characters or the plot and the viewer is left indifferent as to the end result. I found to be meaningless and insincere, and found myself wanting the film to end just so I could leave."
"I'll even take the Bates Motel in Psycho after seeing this truly awful film. How did the likes of Ralph Fiennes, Adrien Brody and F. Murray Abraham ever get suckered into making such a colossal mess as this film?You would think that this film could have done without the constant narration and would have been on the scale of a Grand Hotel like atmosphere. Instead it concentrates on the relationship of a concierge and bell boy, with the former jailed for allegedly poisoning a frequent elderly guest. Most of it concerns itself with the bell boy aiding the concierge's escape from prison and the two constantly alluding the authorities.To me, this made absolutely no sense whatsoever. Abraham relates the story as he did when he played Salieri in Amadeus in 1984."
"i was desperately trying to find something positive to say about this movie, but in vain.It is one of the silliest movies i've ever seen. And i've seen a lot, believe me. For most of the time i had to look at a nose,filling half the screen, that constantly reminded me of the 'arc of triumph' in Paris. The only thrill was trying to be the first to guess which actor was appearing in the next scene. What were those actors thinking when they joined this project ? I fell asleep somewhere in the middle, and when i woke up the nose was still there. What is the purpose of this so called piece of art ? Annoying people to death ? I would have preferred water-boarding over this. A wast of time, a waste of money and a disgrace to the human mind."
"While the film was beautiful pictorially, the all-star cast was wasted on a flimsy script that couldn't decide whether it wanted to be funny or serious. The story itself is a good one, and might have been very compelling if it were handled in a serious way but they way it was handled was plain awful. If Anderson wanted to make a comedy if should have had many more laugh lines in the script. The chuckles from the audience were few and far between, and in fact, they almost sounded somewhat embarrassing, like we're supposed to laugh at this part. You really wonder whether any of the cast actually read the screenplay beforehand. I'd have to say this was pretty disappointing."
"The trailer in the extra features section really sets the tone, letting you know you are in for an extraordinarily pretentious and self-indulgent mess. Most people will hate this, but even if you are drawn to the descriptors avant-garde and quirky you may still be disappointed. The Grand Budapest Hotel embarks on what is supposed to be a surreal, violent, grotesque, mythopoeic, symbol-laden, allegorical journey to spiritual enlightenment. Even taken as a series of allegorical parables, the experiment is a failure. The imagery is rarely interesting, and the symbolism manages to be at once heavy-handed and empty of real meaning. Ideas are essentially thrown at the proverbial wall in the hope that some will stick, like a novice writer who overuses Bartletts and Rogets in an attempt to show off.Wes appears to lack original ideas and so makes superficial use of symbols he doesn't truly understand in a series of cinematic Malapropisms. The film is poorly acted, amateurish, incoherent dreck which tries to convince the viewer that it is something more. Various reviewers have described it as masturbatory, which is accurate.The truly great surrealist artists reject conventions as a choice, but are capable of folowing them: Breton could render a realistic portrait of quality. Many who style themselves as surrealists are people who produce chaotic and shoddy works because they aren't capable of anything else. Don't feel like you have to like this to impress your friends. Its crap. And if you must watch one surrealist western centered on religious themes to make your checklist complete, queue up Greaser's Palace or El Topo instead. They are superior on many levels."
"1.over hyped,overrated,overrated director who makes you sleep 2.Maybe nominated for Oscar 3.Praised by critics 4.its comedy but you wont laughfor god sake don't believe the critics its boring except for beautiful cinematography 1 star for that.2. aspect ratio i know they try to make it look like classic old lookingbut why are we reading a book this is waste with beautiful cinematography its should be wide screen come on every oneeveryone knows which scenes is flash back 3. last things is just boring,forgettable film ever made."
Unfortunately I watched this film from beginning to end and could not believe that people paid good money to make this let alone to watch it. It was utter drivel throughout. The emperors new clothes comes to mind! Do professional film critics of today have no concept of what the ordinary man or woman in the street might actually think? It was thoroughly incomprehensible. The film plot was ridiculous. The acting was weird. I despair that film makers seem to have resorted to this sort of infantile production. Whatever happened to a good story line? Whatever happened to believability? I don't know what else to say other than to advise that if you miss seeing this film you will not be missing anything at all.
"Ah,Wes. You never cease to amaze me. This is one in a row of many that came before it. I feel like this could only be called a ''little brother'' of a movie,strange as it may sound. In retrospect,I can see myself watching it with a hot cup of tea (or coffee),on a rainy day,wearing a big woolly jumper,all wrapped up in my favorite blanket. Of course,none of the mentioned was actually put into action. None the less,this picture is such a treat. Similar to Agatha's 'Courtesan au Chocolat',it is a beautifully decorated piece of perfection,hiding a chocolate surprise on the inside,and packed in a pretty pink box with a signature blue ribbon. A few things come to mind with such a grand slice of cinematography; the guests(ranging from somewhat sane to completely cuckoo),Mr. Gustave's polished black shoes,and of course - pink. Pastel pink everywhere. I also take a liking to the hints of awkwardness that arise,as well as the tension in the air between the characters,so thick you could cut it with a butter knife. Or perhaps,the 'Throat Slitter'... It is clear,from the very beginning of the movie,that everything had to be done perfectly,or the magic of this divine hotel would be lost. A tiny slip up is all it would take for us to lose the smile that'd been lingering on our faces through the whole film. I can say,with out a doubt,much like the painting 'Boy with Apple',this quirky movie is a masterpiece!"
"I just watched the movie and I'm not even sure if I understood all the implications of what I saw: I wonder if the settings, the register of the dialogues, the many and many things that delighted me meant more than what appeared at first sight. If something hidden hit me. I can only say that in the end I was really touched, as if I were in love with what I just watched. I think it was the brilliance of a human mind that struck me so much.I never read Stefan Zweig's writings although I'm aware of how great a writer he was. I'm particularly intrigued now by his autobiography, 'The World of Yesterday', if for no other reason than for the fact that he completed it the day before he took his life. But while watching this film I couldn't help but thinking of the great deal the Author owed to Georges Remi's Tin Tin for the relentless action, the silhouettes, the endless running and the overall imagery.There are no flaws in this film, I can only state my admiration."
"There isn't a zero rating? or a ""minus"" rating? wasted characters, wasted dialog, disjunctive, listed as a ""comedy"" and is NOT a comedy by any stretch of imagination. quick shot of fellatio....stupid. replace the ""apple"" painting with a woman fondling another woman....dumb. Adrien Brody screaming obscenities at the reading of the will...why? Willem Dafoe on skis, being chased...what? Harvey Keitel's prison character with a bad-fitting bald-thing covering his head. Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Edward Norton....shame on you. Adrien Brody---WHY???? people either loved it or loathed it, it seems. I really wanted to ask for a refund. I really don't understand the positive reviews---I guess I wasn't existential enough."
"If you like Wes Anderson, you will love this movie. Witty, entertaining and pleasant, it is a comedy in his unique style, that hits all the tones and notes that make him a unique and original director."
