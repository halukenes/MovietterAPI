"I find it hard to comment on this film without simply repeating what has already been said. It's not that I can't think of anything original, but that others seem to have felt the exact same emotions as I did when watching this film.I saw this movie when I was about 12, 13, maybe 14 years old. So it didn't have the same nostalgic sense it had for so many. But what it did, was make me ache for those memories. I wanted (in the words of another reviewer) to be 12, and *that* cool. I wished I had been like that, that I had had friends like that, laughed like that, and had adventures like that.The 'milk-money' scene was probably one of my all-time favourite scenes in movie history. Up until I saw this movie I had never held much regard for River Phoenix, but the poignancy and sincerity which River added to the role of Chris Chambers touched me to the point of tears. I read in yet another review that in this scene, River was asked to think of a time when he had been hurt by an adult, and that even after the cameras stopped rolling, River sat there still, sobbing and hurting. And I felt every tear and heard every word as though I were there with Chris.This movie made me laugh, cry, rejoice and fear with Chris, Gordie, Teddy and Vern. I loved the campfire scenes, and today I look back on my own childhood, and remember with a laugh the amazingly similar things I used to laugh and wonder about with my friends. I remember dreaming about being a writer and an actress, I remember standing up to bullies, I remember walking or riding with my friends, I remember being afraid, and crying onto a friend's shoulder.I guess what this movie does for everyone, is take them back in time, even though the situations may have been different, chances are you'll find the similarities, and remember with a smile that yes, your life was once *that* cool. In the words of Vern, ""a great time""I especially loved the ending. That they found out who was strong, and who just talked tough. I loved the last scene with Chris and Gordie, and the closing monologue.""I never had any friends later on, like the ones I had when I was twelve...Jesus....does anyone?"""
"This film is a brilliant, well-acted masterpiece! What touched me the most was the late River Phoenix's acting, but all of the young actors performances were incredible. They are why you should see this film. 'Stand By Me' is not a bubblegum Disney film, nor a dry Hollywood film; it is a movie that captures childhood in a poignant, non-candy coated manner that is dead on. I saw this movie only a couple months ago and was blown away by it's style and acting. It is rare that you see such fresh, relaxed and deep performances that the actors in this film offered. Although this is not a recent film, it is a genuine, inspiring film that is so refreshing-being so different than the films Hollywood often gives us. I give this film a 100+ and recommend it to everyone. You will benefit from it's message and it's wonderful acting."
"Without a doubt this movie is probably the best coming of age flick around, it has terrific acting and an incredibly touching plot that keeps you going throughout the whole film. I think the reason I love this film so much is because, everyone in some way could relate to it. When you're a pre-teen and have a close group of friends and face something so intense together, there's that special bond that no matter how much you loose touch with each other, one day, you just think of them and that one incident.Stand by Me is about 4 pre-teen boys whose summer is about to end and they are about to start junior high. They've obviously grown up together and are nervous of the world they are about to face, where they are no longer kids, but just about to become adults. When their friend, Vern, tells them about a kid their age that is missing that he found out by listening in on his brother where the kid's body is, the boys think it would be so cool to find the body and become the local town heroes. They have one problem though, there are these big tough guys who want to find the body first, it's a matter of who will reach it first. But of course, it's the bonding of the boys that really gets you into the film.These are some of the best characters I have seen on film, we start with Gordy. Gordy is an intelligent writer who lost his big brother, his idol, in a car crash recently and can't get any love or respect from his father and it's obvious that he gets it from his friends. That's what keeps him going. Chris is the leader of the gang and Gordy's best friend, he comes from a very bad family and is dubbed the bad seed everywhere, he's the kid who you knew in school and just knew he'd turn out bad, but there's a deeper side to him. The speech that River Phoenix turned out for Chris was so beautifully dilvered as a child who's been disappointed so many times by an adult.Teddy is another bad kid sort of speak, he has a bad home life where his father is crazy and nearly killed him a few times. He has a quick temper, but you can tell that his friends keep him down to Earth and help him through the worst times. Then there's Vern, the funny fat kid who is pretty much scarred of everything, and in some ways is the 4th wheel. Still, Vern you can tell is a great friend and the other's appreciate him despite how he can hold them back.The acting is just phenomenal. Now, the directing, Rob Reiner is without a doubt one of the best directors of all time, he took these young boys and pushed them to their limits, he was so smart about it as well. He said in an interview that he had to get pre-teen boys who were close to the personality of the character in the film, so it would come natural to the pre-teen actors, and you could tell that this film was his baby, he put so much thought and love into this film. That's what makes this film so special, nothing could ever compete with a coming of age film like Stand By Me.10/10"
"Stand By Me is yet another one of the stories made into a movie from the author who has had more stories made into movies than any other author in history, Stephen King. Clearly, the central character here is Gordie Lachance, from whose point of view the story is told and who obviously symbolizes King himself, given many of his characteristics as well as some of the content of the film. This movie is literally filled with actors who have achieved varying degrees of success over the years, such as Jerry O'Connell, who played Vern, River Phoenix, who could have been bigger than Leonardo DiCaprio if he hadn't died, Corey Feldman, who has grown into an unenviable but visible existence, Kiefer Sutherland, who has become an excellent and very well known actor, John Cusack can be seen in a small role as Gordie's late brother, and of course, Richard Dreyfuss, who played the narrator and Gordie as an adult, has remained famous but originally achieved fame more than a decade before Stand By Me was filmed or the original story was even written.Stand By Me takes place in the summer of 1959, the general time period that Stephen King is most skilled at presenting, and four friends set out to find the body of a kid who was killed by a train, hoping to find what they predicted would be astronomical fame. Unfortunately, the town's bullies are also out to find the body for the same reason, which leads to the films ultimate final climax. Even though this is a very clever story with which to tell a fall from innocence story, it is the brilliant characterization and the incredible acting that really make this a classic film. It is extremely rare that a film comes along that stars young kids and is so moving and powerful. Also, every one of those kids is made three dimensional in creative and smooth ways, making you feel like you really knew them by the end of the film. Vern is the fat kid who always gets picked on, Teddy and Chris both have abusive or deranged fathers, not to mention Chris's cruel brother, and Gordie is a young boy who lost his brother three months earlier in a violent accident and who has been largely ignored by his parents ever since. In one memorable scene, Gordie wonders how Teddy can be so enthusiastic about his father's alleged military achievements when the man once held his head to a stove, nearly burning his ear off. Gordie is mystified because he could care less about his own father, who hadn't laid a hand on him since he was three years old and got caught `eating bleach under the sink.'Stephen King pokes fun at his own craft many times in the film, such as in Gordie's vehement line, `F*ck writing. I don't want to be a writer, it's a stupid waste of time!' Not only that, but there are also obvious references to his other works, such as when the boys first realize that no one brought food, and Teddy says, `This is great, what are we supposed to do, eat our feet?' People who actually read instead of just lazily watching the movies will recognize this as a major part of the plot of another of King's short stories, `Survivor Type,' from which Cast Away borrowed heavily. And why don't you people read these books? `The Body,' which Stand By Me was based on, is only 148 pages long, you could read that in a couple of hours and the experience is totally different from a movie. It's even more disturbing that `The Body' was published in the same book (Different Seasons) as a couple of King's other famous stories  `Apt Pupil' and, of course, `Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.'Stand By Me is a story of how one event can unexpectedly change lives. It seems to be a story about friends and how important they are, but this possible theme is clearly dispelled in a line from the narration spoken at the end of the film  `As time went on, we saw less and less of Teddy and Vern, until eventually they became just two more faces in the halls. It happens sometimes, friends come in and out of your life like busboys at a restaurant.' Instead, the film is about learning from a life changing experience and actually making changes or modifying your life in some way because of it, and this is heavily emphasized at the end of the film.Stand By Me is a timeless film. Stephen King's story is skillfully brought to the screen under the direction of Rob Reiner, and the 1950s are brought back to life just as successfully as King so often does in his stories and novels, with the slicked back hair, the hot rods, and in the film, and excellent 50s soundtrack. There is so much more to this film than just the superficial story  things about the characters and the story, but also about the tremendously talented man who wrote it all."
"I am 14 years old, and I absolutely love this movie. But don't let my age fool you. I'm not just going to sit here and talk about how hott River Pheonix was.This movie is well rounded in my perspective. Everyone can relate to at least one of the boys in it at one time in their life. The actors are matched perfectly with who their character portrays.Corey Feldman's character Teddy is the boy who's sensitive about his dad, but tries to hide it, Jerry O' Connell's character Vern is the chubby, wussy kid, but still part of the club, Wil Wheaton's character Gordie is the sweet, intelligent friend who tells stories to the other boys and is ignored by his parents, and River Phoenix's character Chris is the boy in the neighborhood that's been labeled a bad kid and feels he'll never get out of their town, the peacemaker, and Gordie's best friend. This movie just sucks you in as soon as you start watching it. It's not overly mushy and sad, but it's not so tough that only a sixteen year old boy could stand it. You feel for each character, no matter how mean or nice they are. My personal favorite is Chris Chambers, which i know this will probably drive you guys nuts that almost every other person does too, but River Phoenix is just so touching. The campfire scene is great, the milk money seen is great, and one of my favorites is the train scene. You can definitely see the terror in their faces. It's funny that they all act so tough, except maybe Vern, although he tries, and they still like talking about goofy and dancing and singing along to Lollipop. You also just want to be there with them. Feel that kind of friendship that so many people long for. It's such a feel good movie, but not in the sense of a 10 year old's feel good movie. It makes you feel complete when you watch it. It's not jam packed with action sequences or it doesn't have fluffy pink bunnies hopping around in it either. It's just one of a kind. Definitely worth my time and yours.The newest DVD of Stand By Me (Special Edition) has Walking the Tracks: The Summer of Stand By Me where all the main actors,except River, and Rob Reiner are interviewed. They also talk about working with River Phoenix. There's also the Stand By Me music video with River Phoenix, Wil Wheaton, and obviously Ben E. King. Not to mention an extra CD with some awesome oldie's songs like Everyday, Lollipop, Stand By Me, and Mr. Lee."
"Growing up isn't easy for anyone. There are times when you feel no one understands you at all. Although growing up is tough, the friends you have at a young age are the friends you'll remember for the rest of your life. Stand By Me is a very wonderful film, a masterpiece on a small scale. The film is full of great insights into the minds of a group of four boys who decide they want to see what a dead body looks like, and it sparks their interest even more that they actually knew this dead person. A young boy's mind is full of many things, they feel lost sometimes, strong at others, but mostly they feel invinceable. Rob Reiner has directed a film about four young boys who discover life is quick, sometimes merciless, and magical. I've seen this film numerous times and it always seems better than the time before. This is a perfect little film."
"As a lover of Stephen King's writing style and Rob Reiner's directing techniques, this movie leaves me speechless every time. It is an almost forgotten film about a time and a youth nearly forgotten, as well. And I will say, as a writer, the novella that this film was based upon, ""The Body"" has and always will be the inspiration for my style of writing.First of all, I enjoy the title that was chosen for the film. ""Stand By Me"" fits what the characters in the story are facing.  I think that all who have seen this film will agree that the problems are all things that we can relate to.  All of us know someone like these characters. Most of us have met the boy down the road who had a brother with a bad name and a father with an alcohol problem, automatically being labeled as a ""bad kid."" And the boy with the military father, abusive and a little whacko. The fat kid, picked on and ridiculed for his weight.To me, Gordy represents all of us. I found myself seeing a little of me in Gordy as I watched the film. I don't know if any one else shares this, but it was true. Gordy was not very strong, at first, and was not sure what he wanted, except to be with his friends. Still coping with the loss of his brother and the fact that his father was disrespectful to him, Gordy still stood up for what he believed in. And, in the end he surprised the characters and the viewers by standing up to the bullies that had plagued them all.This film is certainly one of my top favorites. In fact, it lies in my top three, probably at #2 or #3. I feel that it is a film that everyone should see at some point in their life due to the fact it changes your look at youth and their trials. Few films are able to do that and I think that this one was an inspiration for others that will do the same in the future."
"Perhaps this is a personal bias because I had friends like this when I was 12, but having said that this is one of the best films I have ever seen and it hits every chord perfectly.There were four of us that were friends and we were known as the Stand By Me Crew. Mike, Gary, Andy and myself were inseparable. And as this film prophesizes correctly, the group has since split up and now I am only good friends with one of them. This movie makes you remember what it was like to have friends when you were 12 and it makes you glad that they were there when they were.The story involves these four kids going on a weekend hike to find a dead kid that apparently got hit by a train. Now if that is all the movie was about, it would probably be pretty boring. But this film explores the fears and anxieties of what it was like to be 12 again. Twelve year olds deal with a plethora of issues and it is not often that adults listen to what kids have to say or see what they deal with. But this film is honest about it's assessment of how they feel.The four boys are played brilliantly by Wil Wheaton, Jerry O'ConnellCoosh from Jerry Maguire ), Corey Feldman and River Phoenix. The story moves along and hits a nerve because of the life that these four actors brings to their characters. There is a real sense of comrarderie between the four of them. But ultimately it is Phoenix that brings the most life to his character and I would say that the milk money scene with him and Gordie (Wheaton) is one of the more touching and poignant scenes ever filmed.What Stand By Me does is brings you back to a time when friendship was more pure and innocent and meant more. You can't help but get caught up in the nostalgia. Perhaps this film means more to me for personal reasons ( as I've already stated ) but it is a wonderful film and it should be enjoyed by everyone.The last line of the movie is so true. Do we really ever have friends as good as the ones when we were twelve? I doubt it."
"Stephen King adaptations can be great. In my opinion the less horror pictures, and The Shining, are the best. Misery, The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile and this one. Stand by Me is a great film, you can say it is a drama with some thriller elements.Four boys hear the location of the dead body of a boy from their small town. The boys go on a trip to look for the body, about 30 miles away. There are some little problems on the way, including another gang with its leader Kiefer Sutherland. One of the boys thinks about his late brother because of the recent events, played by John Cusack. It seems to be a simple story but it is told perfect.The performances the boys give, one of them is the late River Phoenix, are all extraordinary. I liked the way their friendship was shown. Just a great movie, see this. 9/10."
"Hands down this is my favorite movie. (With the Sandlot in second place). My mom got this movie for me when i was about 12. I saw it the first time and realized that i had friends like that. The movie is definitely one every teenage kid should see. I think it is more of a movie for boys but girls can get out of it the same as the boys can. But the movie overall is great because its just about a four friends who have no experience with the ""real world"". They find out about a dead body and go in search to find it. At first they just do it to be famous and get a reward. But the quest of the boys throughout the movie reveal things that even themselves didn't know about. After it all, the boys find out about reality, and how it isn't glamorous. They realize that the body could of been them and they respect that. In my opinion the point of the movie was not to have you think of when you were 12 and your good friends but to think of what you have now, and what you do with it. In the end Gordie tells us what happens to each and how each kind of go their separate ways. (Such as the last scene of the movie). This is definitely a movie to not only rent but buy. I tip my hat to Reiner."
"""It happens sometimes. Friends come in and out of our lives, like busboys in a restaurant.""Stand By Me is Rob Reiner's love letter to friendship and nostalgic memories. It's ironic that Reiner's film looks at the past with such high regards because we can do the same with his filmography. His best films were all made in the 80's (and we can squeeze Misery and A Few Good Men into that list as well although they came out in 1990 and 1992 respectively), and despite not having directed many great films over the past few decades we can still look back at his early films and appreciate his classics. Stand By Me reminds us all of our early childhood and the friendships we made. It doesn't matter what decade we grew up in, we all cherish special memories of adventures we shared with our friends and how they helped shape us. That is what is so universal and appealing about Reiner's film; even though we may never have grown up in a small town or had similar outdoor adventures it still recalls us back to a time where we were discovering new things about the world and standing up for our friends when they were in trouble or running with them when we got caught playing in our neighbor's yards. Stand By Me focuses on these memories and it's not just about the adventure in itself but the bond these friends shared together. It's probably the go to movie when we are comparing or referencing other coming of age films, and in my opinion one of the best ever made considering how much I appreciate the genre. I'm sure the film itself was a life changing experience for many who grew up watching it and dreaming of having similar adventures with their friends.Based on Stephen King's short story, ""The Body,"" the screenplay for the film was adapted by Raynold Gideon and Bruce Evans. It takes place in 1959 and centers on four 12 year old friends from Castelrock, Oregon who overhear a conversation about the location of the body of a dead boy who had been missing for several days. The news about the disappearance of this boy had spread all over town, so these kids decide to embark on an adventure through the woods and bring back the missing body so they can be received as heroes. Since the journey would take more than a full day, they plan to tell their parents that they are staying at each other's home. Gordie (Will Wheaton) had recently lost his older brother (played by John Cusack in the flashback scenes) a few months prior to this in a car accident so he knew his mourning parents wouldn't even mind him being gone for a few days. His best friend, Chris (River Phoenix), came from a troublesome family and despite knowing he'd get into trouble if they'd discover his lie he didn't think it would be any different if he stayed with his drunk father. Teddy (Corey Feldman) still has the scars from the abuse he suffered from his mentally unstable father, and currently lives with his mother. Vern (Jerry O'Connell), the clown of the group who isn't taken very seriously is the one who came up with the idea of looking for the body, but he also is the first to back down when it comes to it. The four finally decide to go ahead with their plan and begin their adventure, which will eventually shape who they are. The story is narrated by the grown up version of Gordie (played by Richard Dreyfuss) somewhere around 1985.The strong performances in this film are one of the reasons why it continues to work today. River Phoenix was such a natural and is so charismatic that he steals every scene he's in. The chemistry he shares with Wheaton's character is strong and it reminds us all of that best friend we had in our childhood. Corey Feldman must have had the best agent because he starred in some of the best films that were released in the 80's (Gremlins, The Goonies, The Burbs, and The Lost Boys). Jerry O'Connell is probably the one that has undergone the greatest physical transformation, but he was perfect for the role of Vern and he reminded us of that friend who always seemed to be the butt of every joke. These four young actors carry the film and despite not having the most exciting of adventures, the way the story is told is what makes it such a fascinating one. There are small moments like the one where they gather around the camp fire to listen to Gordie's story, or when they are crossing the pond and discover its full of leeches, that stand out. The film is told through Gordie's recollection of these events and each scene feels like an authentic memory someone would have of such a life changing experience. The 50's soundtrack also plays a key role in the film since it adds to the overall sense of nostalgia. Reiner's film reminds me how much I actually have enjoyed Stephen King's non-horror stories (this along with Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile are my favorite film adaptations of his work). Since its 1986 release, all the coming of age films that have followed it seem to heavily borrow from it. Stand By Me is the measuring stick for films in this genre.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"In ancient Greece people watched the great tragedies in the amphi-theatres, and eyewitnesses tell us that audiences of 20'000 sat crying when the main character on the stage became aware of his fatal guilt and had to face death. They called it catharsis, best translated by 'cleaning the souls'. Well, measured by the tremendous effect on all of us writing reviews on the film, STAND BY ME has the power and qualities of ancient tragedy. This jewel of a film touches and shakes the best sides in us. I have watched it over and over again, and even if I watch it several times a week I still sit and laugh and cry, and it leaves me sad and confused and grateful, feelings that can last for hours and sometimes days.So what is the mystery behind this masterpiece?First of all it teaches us that good filmmaking isn't about the dollars spent on the production, but about the people who make it.And it's about a unique and humble (I hope you understand what I mean) director: Rob Reiner doesn't try to show how good he is, leering at the Oscar-jury:the story is told without any visual effects, the pace is slow and the cinematography is unspectacular, but he succeeds in inspiring his young actors to perform honest feelings and letting the story develop by its own terms. An example is the milkmoney-scene. It is told that Reiner wasn't satisfied with the performance of River Phoenix. They tried again and again. Finally, he told River to remember a situation of his own life where a grownup had let him down. Guess if he succeeded with it! River Phoenix started crying and he couldn't stop crying a long time after the shot was taken. That's why this film is pure gold: it doesn't show professional acting, it shows young boys who open their hearts in front of a camera. They can do it, because they can relate to similar experiences and because the message is important and universal. We all can relate to similar situations. These scenes make me remember events from my own youth that I had inhibited for a long time, because I didn't like to remember them. That's the pain!But it's not only the director and the actors who should earn all the credits. I read the novel after watching the film, and since that time Stephen King is one of the great contemporary writers in my book. I just don't understand why he doesn't write more of THE BODY kind. To me this book is pure poetry (including all those four-letter-words that Maltin e. a. don't like, because they don't understand why they are necessary)! But the most amazing thing is: the script doesn't only catch the quintessence of the novel, it's partly even better! This perfect balance between humor and seriousness! It doesn't manipulate the audience. In the book grownup Gordon sits in his car when he had read about his friend's death. ""I drove out of town, parked, and cried for him. Cried for damn near half an hour, I guess."" In the film Gordon doesn't cry. He doesn't need to. Everyone in the audience feels like crying, because they understand the tragedy! There are only 13 pages of dialogue and narration, and there really is not one line too much. It's so good, I almost know the whole of it by heart. Take the ending: In the book, the famous writer Gordon Lachance tells about how he met Ace Merrill again, some twenty years after the Ray Brower event: grown fat and the only one alive of his old friends and enemies. How much better is the film's ending! This important line about the friends we had when we were twelve years old is only a line in King's book, commending the good time the boys have at Milo Pressman's junkyard! If there had been an Oscar for impressive film endings, this film had deserved the first!And thank you Jack Nitzsche for the intense score. It's Gordie's theme, when he's not with his friends. In the group Gordie is the smart boy with the sharp, quick, fresh replies. Without the friends, at home or in the store he barely speaks a word. And then we can hear that fragile Jack Nitzsche variation on Stand by me. It's like Gordie crying `where are you, Chris? Come, stand by me'. That's brilliant and exactly what great filmmusic should be: serving the film's dramaturgy.Well, I don't know how many hours it took me to express my love to this film in a language that isn't my own. It seems impossible. It is exactly as Stephen King expressed it himself (end of chapter 29): `Even if I'd known the right thing to say, I probably couldn't have said it. Speech destroys the functions of love, I think - that's a hell of a thing for a writer to say, I guess, but I believe it to be true. If you speak to tell a deer you mean it no harm, it glides away with a single flip of its tail. The word is the harm. Love isn't what these asshole poets like McKuen want you to think it is. Love has teeth; they bite; the wounds never close. No word, no combination of words, can close those lovebites. It's the other way around, that's the joke. If those wounds dry up, the words die with them. Take it from me. I've made my life from the words, and I know that is so.'10 out of 10, no doubt about it!"
"Another GREAT 80s FILM EASY way for me to say. DO NOT REMAKE THIS FILM IT IS ONE OF 80s BEST FILM'S EVER MADE.
Vern was one of my favorite KIDS in the FILM.
He was AWESOME I liked how Corey Played the LOONEY KID. YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS MOVIE BETTER SO LEAVE IT ALONE."
"Stand By Me is without a doubt one of the finest pieces of film ever made in the history of humanity. A truly excellent movie that really strikes and affects you with all its glory. It leaves no one untouched whether you're 12 or 112 years old. Simply because it deals with life and friendship, and all that comes with it. Both the good and the bad.Everyone can relate to it and feel what the characters feel. Because we've all been there. We have all done similar things to what they are doing, we have all been dealing with the same issues in life as they are faced with and we all still are.Few films are able do depict the theme of life and friendship as successfully as Stand By Me. In my opinion there are practically no flaws in this production, everything from the plot and the screenplay to the characters and the actors are top notch. Also the music is great.Watching the movie one feel everything from happiness and laughter to fear and grief. Laughter because we remember how fun it was being a child. With everything being new and exciting in life. And facing it all together with our friends. Fear and grief because of how hard it can be having to grow up and let go of the past. Let go of our old friends and our old life. One can't help but to feel nostalgic. At least I do. It makes me think about life in a larger sense. Thinking about my childhood I realize how long ago it was or at least seems to be. The movie frees a lot of emotions and thoughts regarding both my own life and life in general.This movie also has one of the best opening scenes in film history. I almost burst into tears every time I see it. It's as close to perfection as it gets. It's so beautiful and sad. Simply the perfect way to launch the rest of the movie. How the beautiful soft music first almost reaches out and touch you, while seeing the landscape. Then a close up on the car and the main character reading the chocking news of his dear old friend's death. Thereafter such a smooth passage back to his childhood with focus on the kids passing by on their bikes and the music still in the background. Excellent!To conclude I have also one little flaw, or at least I think of it that way. It's regarding the whole ""Lardass-scence"". When I was little I could never figure out why it was in the film. I couldn't see the connection to the rest of the film. Being older and hopefully a little wiser :D I now see that it's a way of showing Gordies talent for making up stories, the talent that have him becoming a writer one day. However I feel this could have been illustrated in a better way. I've always felt that scene is just a little bit over the top and I still do. Otherwise Stand By Me is close to a masterpiece. No one should go through life without seeing and experiencing this wonderful film."
"In 1959, in Castle Rock, Oregon, the boys Gordie Lachance (Wil Wheaton), Chris Chambers (River Phoenix), Teddy Duchamp (Corey Feldman) and Vern Tessio (Jerry O'Connell) learn that the teenager Ray Brower, who is missing, was hit by a train and is dead in a nearby river. They decide to find the body to become local heroes and along their journey, they disclose secrets and learn the importance of their friendship.""Stand by Me"" is another nostalgic little gem from the 80's with a coming-of-age drama, with funny and heartbreaking moments. The plot is simple but realistic and supported by a group of promising young actors. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Conta Comigo"" (""Count on Me"")"
"Stand By Me is probably the best film ever to come from a Stephen King story. (The Green Mile sucks, by the way.) The story is told from an adult writer's point of view as he recounts an adventure he shared with his three best friends in the waning moments of the summer before junior high school began. We see the four boys head out into the wilderness to see the dead body of a boy who was apparently hit by a train. The boys encounter bullies, other trains, leeches, vicious dogs, and many other things on their trip. And they have some pretty deep and emotional conversations along the way.This is a very awkward age in the life of a young man. You can tell by listening to their conversation topics which range from boobs to whether or not Mighty Mouse can beat up Superman. The youngsters are portrayed flawlessly by four terrific young actors. Who would have thunk that Jerry O'Connell would turn out to be the most successful of them? At times they laugh, other times they pick on each other. Sometimes they seem on the verge of fighting, but when challenged by the older gang of bullies, they stick together. Richard Dreyfuss, who plays the adult writer, narrates the action as things move along. Their trip is full of surprises and emotional insight.Stand By Me is not quite a classic in my book, but it is very memorable. The script is a little too pessimistic for my liking. Right down to when River Phoenix describes an incident where he's caught stealing milk money from school, and his teacher ends up keeping it for herself. There is also a complete lack of positive supporting characters during the scenes set back when they were kids. Only John Cusack, in a cameo role, is shown as a positive older character. No wonder these kids felt so unwanted! All the adults around them were jerks! The script uses more swear words than are actually necessary to convey the anger these kids sometimes feel. And you'd think any dead body that had been hit by a train would be more damaged than the one they find out in the woods. Wouldn't this kid have heard the train coming in time and jumped well out of the way? If he was trying to kill himself, then you'd think he would have stood in the way and been completely pulverized. I know these may seem like petty beefs, but they are enough to knock the review down a star or two.It seems like the film is trying to portray the dead Brower boy as the death of these kids' innocence or something to that effect. As someone who's been their age, I can understand some of what they were feeling. And I totally agree that some of the people you thought were your best friends eventually just turn out to be faces in the crowd at school a few years later.Despite it's faults, this is a powerful film you aren't likely to forget. It's one of Reiner's best, and the outstanding cast does some wonderful work themselves.8 of 10 stars.The Hound."
"I am still a big River Phoenix fan even after his death. This movie I would have to say was his best movie in his earlier roles. All the guys did an awesome job portraying their characters. This movie made me cry, laugh, and rejoice. This movie is just another Rob Reiner masterpiece! I especially love the very last scene where Gordie (Dreyfuss) is finishing his story and he writes about how he has never had friends like he had when he was twelve, and that as anyone? I am only thirteen, and this movies was made the year I was born, but I can still relate to this film so much. I have seen the movie about 12 times, and every time I watch it I understand it more and more. I saw most of the movie when I was about 10 years-old, and the message didn't really sink in then. Now that I am older I can understand the message and relate to it better. The actors really pull you into the movie and script to see what it really was like back then. I know I will refer back to movie time and time again until my dying day. This movie is spectacular!!!!!"
"This film is a brilliant, well-acted masterpiece! What touched me the most was the late River Phoenix's acting, but all of the young actors performances were incredible. They are why you should see this film. 'Stand By Me' is not a bubblegum Disney film, nor a dry Hollywood film; it is a movie that captures childhood in a poignant, non-candy coated manner that is dead on. I saw this movie only a couple months ago and was blown away by it's style and acting. It is rare that you see such fresh, relaxed and deep performances that the actors in this film offered. Although this is not a recent film, it is a genuine, inspiring film that is so refreshing-being so different than the films Hollywood often gives us. I give this film a 100+ and recommend it to everyone. You will benefit from it's message and it's wonderful acting."
"These kinda movies come along very rarely. This is my personal all-time favorite movie. The actors are very talented, especially Wil Wheaton (Gordie) and River Phoenix (Chris) who are my 2 favorite actors. It is based on a Stephen King novella called ""The Body"" and I have read the book and it was fantastic also. The script was put together very well and they done very good on the screen play. All of the actors were very young whenever they shot this and they all showed extreme maturity. I think a lot of people can relate to this movie because it cuts so deep into the heart. I wish that I could have a best friend like Gordie had Chris and Chris had Gordie. Yeah, I have a best friend, but we aren't ""best"" best friends... If you have not seen this movie you need to go out and find it because im sure that this movie will change your life like it did mine."
"The movie Stand by Me is a story about four close twelve year old friends growing up in rural Oregon who are bitten by the curiosity bug. The main Character, Gordie (Wil Wheaton), and his three friends, Chris (River Pheonix), Teddy (Corey Feldman), and Vern (Jerry O'Connell) set out on an adventure to find the body of Ray Brower. They had heard of his whereabouts by Vern's older brother and they were determined to find him. They incur many setbacks during their journey. They are bullied by the older boys of the town who are also trying to find the body and get the fame, attacked by the junkyard dog Chopper, almost getting run down by a train, and attacked by the swamp leaches. The boys learn many lessons on their journey, but more importantly they learn about life. The actual goal of Rob Reiner, director of the film, was to show that growing up has its ups as well as downs. All four of the main characters have had some trouble in their life. He showed this when Gordie's athletic brother was tragically killed in a car accident. By doing this, Reiner elaborates to the audience that bad things do happen to the best people. Chris and Teddy also have very neglecting fathers at their homes. Even though it is all fun and games on the hunt for the body, they still have a troubled life lingering in the background that they can not get away from. And good old Vern has an older brother who wreaks havoc in his life. He is actually one of the older bullies also on the hunt for the body. Reiner cannot make his point much clearer. One of the things I really loved about this movie is how few rules the young twelve year old boys had. The first evident thing is when the movie opens and they are smoking in their tree house. These boys smoke, shoot handguns in town, and cuss like sailors throughout the movie and know one seems to notice. Wow, the times sure have changed since I was a young child."
"I saw this movie a few years ago and I instantly thought it was great. It's a memorable story (adapted from an unusual literary venture for Stephen King) about four 12-year-old boys in 1959 who go in search of a dead body. Everything about this movie was memorable: the script, the acting, and most of all, the four boys. All of them had distinct personalities and backgrounds and didn't blend into each other like so many other movies like this. My favorite character was Chris Chambers, who was not only cute but a ""bad boy"" with a heart of gold (also the breakout role for River Phoenix). This is a must-see for anyone who likes a good movie. The only problem I had with this movie was that I found it unrealistic. The 12-year-old boys in the movies cussed every two words, smoked cigarettes regularly, and talked admiringly in detail about some girl's boobs. I found this unusual even for 1959. I was 12 once, and most of the boys I knew rarely cussed, never smoked anything, and were just a smidge too far from puberty to talk about a girl's boobs in detail. However, these small qualities are redeemed. This is a great movie from the great Stephen King."
"I am as many are, a huge fan of Stephen's King Works. I have also been a fan of many of the films made from his books. Some I am not a fan of. I have not read as of yet and I'm sure I will, The Body. I have seen Stand By Me several times and I am conflicted in many of the great portions of this film and the ideas behind the movie vs the fact that it just doesn't sit with me as entertaining.Stand By Me is considered perhaps one of the forefront coming of age films and for good reason. It's the story of four best friends set in the fifties/sixties told through the eyes of the Gordie Lachance who has lost his role model best friend older brother to an accident. Haunted by the loss of his brother and the fact that everyone seems to have only cared about his older brother including his parents, he is compelled to encourage his group of friends to go on a trek across the county to find the dead body of a missing boy. Unfortunately the ""bad kids"" and ""bullies"" in town also discover that this body is nearby and they race to find it first. During their trek they discover more about each other, and they stand together to overcome their fears about their own lives.I do whole heartedly agree in the pure heart of this film, the coming of age, the different personalities of each boy in the film. It does aim to find a little something of everyone in each boy and it accomplishes that. The cast, especially for young actors is very good. Wil Wheaton as the lead character appears to be weaker than his best friend played by the late River Phoenix but in the end he is really who holds them altogether and overcomes the most of all of them. River Phoenix ironically plays the ""bad boy"" best friend who seems to have very little future but has taken Wheaton's character under his wing and encourages him to make something of himself. Corey Feldman fills in his usual role adequately. Jerry O'Connell as the made fun of ""fat kid"" also plays his role well. Keifer Sutherland who can't help but look like a jerk and an evil fiend also plays well. The cast is basically The Brat Pack and yet for an eighties film it's quite darker than most Brat Pack films. Wholely realistic is the kids' views on life, their fascination with death, cigarettes, adult things, and their adult language. Their trying to be as grown up as possible without any real adult role models.My issue is that the film just doesn't hit me. It never satisfies me or entertains me. I find it entirely too short, very, very, predictable and without any real depth of plot. I know everyone sees this film as a classic and certainly it has it's strong points as I outlined but overall it just falls short for me. The soundtrack, and I absolutely love these songs feels forced like Reiner is trying to force the feeling of the era on us rather than create it all around them. In this case I don't expect anyone to believe my opinion because I am sorely outnumbered but I don't care for this film much at all.5/10"
"Good story about childhood. Parents, freedom, dreams. And friends. Real friends.
This scenario is simple. After watching the film, there remains a slight aftertaste of losing something important. Something that will never return."
"i just watched this movie and i have been planning to watch this movie for a long time, this movie is awesome it is moving and just brilliant in every way, i guess the moral of the story is that just cherish every moment you have, had and experiencing because you know we don't live forever. and yes the end made me cry thats just how touching it is, and you know it is true you never find new awesome friends like you did when you was younger. recommend it if you wanna look back at your past and be lost in thought and your future, past and present and just say hey that time was awesome and i wish i could do that again with my old friends :) . . . Krishna c Patel"
"The most amazing film, truly one of the best i have ever seen, Incredibly funny and the performances from the young boys in the film were just the best i have ever seen in my life. I'm very surprised that they are not as famous as i would of thought they would be to this day. There is a lot of bad language in the film but it just makes it seem more realistic. There were also some tearful moments in it too especially towards the end but i think that just made the movie seem even more special to me. This film has everything, its funny, its adventurous, its tearful and it has a friendship based plot. every time someone asks me what my favourite movie is i always say this one. Don't miss out watch it!"
"I'd have to say that this movie is my favorite movie of all time. It's an incredible, sentimental tale of four boys, Chris, Gordie, Teddy, and Vern and their quest to find the body of Ray Brower. This movie had me right when I saw the charm of it. During the movie you get to see into the lives of the boys, and you find that this movie is really about friendship, and needing your friends through hard times. Stand By Me also has a few funny wise cracks, and times that will pull at your heartstrings. I think the ability to include so many different aspects in one movie is fantastic, and definitely a worthwhile film. I recommend Stand By Me to anybody and everybody- I can't think of many people who wouldn't enjoy this ""coming of age story"" that will grab you and catch your attention just like it has mine, over and over again, not matter how many times i watch it."
"Stand By Me is the story of four adolescent boys who venture out of their small Oregon town in search of a boy who has disappeared and feared dead. Only two people know where he really is. When word reaches these boys, the race is on to find him.The leader of this crew is Chris Chambers (River Phoenix), a strong willed individual who carries a bum rap. Gordie Lachance (Will Wheaton) idolized Chris and everything he does. Gordie has been the ""other child"" at home since his brother died. The headstrong Teddy Duchamp (Corey Feldman) is the renegade ""wild-man"" whose war weary father has made a strong impact on, for better and for worse. The last of this ""gang"" is Vern Tessio (Jerry O'Connell), the one who found out about the resting place of the lost boy. Vern is slightly overweight and jittery; the tag-a-long friend.Narrated by an older Gordie (Richard Dreyfuss), now a writer, we see the characters through his eyes essentially, even though it isn't just about Gordie, but all of them. Reiner's casting is superb for all four friends and even the older kids. The leader of the older kids is Ace Merrill (Kiefer Sutherland), a dark and menacing character who strikes fear into the hearts of the four boys. It is his presence that makes the boys more determined than ever to find the body before he does The next two days for these boys is filled with obstacles, both on the tough Oregon landscape and in their troubled minds. It seems like they live their entire childhood and adolescent years in a span shorter than 48 hours. Usually a person experiences certain things one at a time over a long period of time. It seems that no matter where these boys go in life, they will never forget those two days when they were no long children, but men."
"I am 13 and have seen this movie about 1000 times since I bought it. My older brother saw it and told me I wouldn't understand it, and I wasn't going to like it. But, they day after I watched it on TV, I rushed to the store and bought it. It's been about 2 weeks and I have seen it so many times, and yet, every time, I laugh and cry the same as I did the time before. After I bought the movie, I had two of my best friends come over and see it. I knew they would love it just as much as I did. Sometimes my parents actually have to drag me out of bed in the morning because I stayed up so late watching it the night before. My brother keeps telling me, ""One day, you are going to say, "" I never want to see that movie again."""" But I keep telling him back, ""That'll NEVER happen!"""
"First of all I would like to say I'm not the best of film critics out there and what I wanted to say about this film has already been said through the other fantastic posts on here. I just want to repeat it myself, echo my borrowed thoughts through the tool of writing. Let people know how great this film is from my own view.The film is about four friends who share the emotions, trials and tribulations of growing up, through a decision to go on a trek and find the body of a missing child of a similar age to them. This film makes you so feel so much (without giving too much away).Although I have seen a few films on TV, I usually change the channel half way through. On one particular day last year I was flicking through like I do, half blankly staring at the screen, when I came across this film. I sat and down and watched it to the end, a rare accomplishment for me.From my own opinion, films can never really evoke real life. Some films can, fair enough, but what hit me most about this film was how the ending could fit into real life. The ending was so ordinary. There was no fairytale element to this film whatsoever. Thats what made this film so feel-good for me.I have seen the films My girl, Casablanca, Titanic and The Shawshank Redemption (all brilliant films which I have also taken the care to watch). They have never even brought a lump to my throat. The ending to Stand By Me was so personally heart-felt, however, I was not ready for the emotion that would overwhelm me. A personal experience that has changed who I am.Definitely one of my top 3 films for life."
"Everythings been said and done about this movie. But I just thought I would put my own opinion on it.I'm 14 years old. I seen this movie for the first time this summer. And I bought it. After that, I've watched it over 50 times. I showed it to all my friends, they all watched it. They also, all loved it.So I thought I'd just mention how this movie, which was probably my grandmothers favorite movie back in the day, can still be popular for kids my age. It makes me wish i lived in those days, it makes me want to be a part of their gang. With ""Chris Chambers"", and all of those unique and hilarious characters. It makes me want to have my own adventure like they did.I recommend this movie to everyone! Because I think everyone will like it just as much as I did."
"Currently, ""Stand By Me"" is rated #180 on IMDb--a very, very impressive score that would indicate that this is a great film. However, try as I might, I have no idea why the film is rated this highly and I thought the movie was just average to above average and no more. This film is based on a story by Stephen King and is directed by Rob Reiner. It has a very interesting cast of kids all about age 12--Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Connell, River Phoenix and Wil Wheaton--all before they became stars. These four boys decide one summer to go looking for a dead body--the body of a kid who is missing and who was hit by a train. They know about where the body is because one of them overheard one of the older punks talking about discovering it. Almost the entire film consists of the four boys trekking cross-country to find the body. Along the way, they have some adventures, curse a lot and experience togetherness.There were two things I really liked about the film--the nice 1950s music and the acting of two of the characters. Wheaton and Phoenix were blessed to have been given well-rounded and interesting characters to play--and both were outstanding. On the other hand, Feldman and especially O'Connell played characters that seemed much more like caricatures--difficult to believe and rather stereotypical. Something I didn't like was the language, as f-bombs and lots of other nasty language abounded. Now I know that some kids talk like this, that's true, but it tended to make the kids less likable AND made the film less family-friendly--which it easily could have been.Overall, the film really was adequate and nothing special. I expected special but only once or twice (such as with a poignant scene with Wheaton) was I left thinking the film was anything other than a coming of age story and nothing more. I just didn't get it..."
"Four boys go in search of a dead body, but it becomes a journey of discovery about themselves. The premise of the story (based on a King novella) is stupid and generally uninteresting and the execution is clichéd. Reiner seems unsure of where he wants to go with the film; it just rambles on pointlessly. There is an irrelevant interlude about a pie-eating contest filled with gross puking scenes. The characters are either stereotypes (the teens) or cartoon-like (the parents and other adults). The big emotional scenes are corny and forced. The framing device, where the story is related in flashbacks, is meant to be poignant but it just falls flat."
"This movie was like that baseball girl, who got thrown out at home. Except there aren't any girls in it except for maybe this waitress who looks like Big Bird and thinks a gun and a cherry bomb are the same thing. These 4 kids want to visit this other kid in a different town, so they make up excuses to leave home and walk around railroad tracks. That other kid's dead though, so it was definitely a good idea to bring a comb.One of the kids is like Crisco. Fat in the can, and digging holes under the porch because you can't buy much food for 7 cents. You get to hear about an even fatter kid who can make people puke on each other, because cartoons can't beat up real guys.I don't really want to think about guys prancing through the woods singing songs about lollipops or sitting around in wet tighty-whiteys yanking bugs off each other. And I definitely wouldn't want anyone Standing By ME if I had to pick giant swamp-roaches out of my undies."
"This is such a great movie. It is a very brave, and entertaining comedy/drama, that actually has the courage to show 12-year-olds as they really are, and doesn't clean it up for the whole family like most movies of this kind do. It's a hilarious comedy at times, but is also very heartwarming and tragic.Most of you know the story. The set up for the adventure is when four pre-teen boys learn about the whereabouts of a missing local kid's dead body. They end up going on a twenty mile quest to find the body, and hope to become heroes. Gordie Lachance (Wil Wheaton) is a sensitive, and intellectual kid who lives in the shadow of his dead older brother Dennis (John Cusack), who was the only one in his family who actually understood him. Everybody acknowledges to him about how well his brother played football, which makes Gordie's pain even worse. His parents don't seem to care about him anymore, and he feels that his dad hates him. He is a great storyteller, and his best friend Chris Chambers (River Phoenix), gives him hope and encouragement.Chris Chambers is an abused kid who comes from a family of lowlife thugs, including his cruel older brother Eyeball (Bradley Gregg). Chris is a good kid, and although he has made some bad choices, he still remains a very positive character. His family's bad reputation alienates him from society, and he doesn't have much of a chance in life because of it. In one of the most heartbreaking scenes, he tells Gordie about how a teacher cold-heartedly took advantage of his bad reputation, when he tried to return some money he stole. Teddy Duchamp (Corey Feldman) is a somewhat crazy and disturbed kid, who loves his dad (only because he was a WW2 veteran), who nearly burned off his ear on a stove. Teddy is sarcastic, and rude, but in a rather nice way, and would still be a good friend.Vern Tessio (Jerry O'Connell) is the main source of the movie's humor. He is a squeamish, cry-baby, scaredy-cat. He insists that Gordie doesn't tell any horror stories, and is worried about the dumbest things (a coyote, a dog, the results of a coincidental coin flip). He is really just a tag along, who is always being picked on by the rest of the gang, particularly Teddy (who frequently punches him, and gives him two more for flinching). He is the one who learns about the body's whereabouts, and gives the others the idea for the quest.The dead body is really just a set up for a series of adventures that the boys have on their journey. They nearly get run over by a train on a bridge in one scene, and in another they face a mythical junkyard dog. And when they find the body, they have to face a ruthless gang of older kids led by Ace (Keifer Sutherland), who are also after the body. They have campfires, and share a bond that is very touching. Any guy who has ever had a group of friends can relate to the antics of these four boys. They cuss like sailors, smoke, and do other things that they wouldn't do with their parents around. The way these boys talk, and act is very accurate to the way kids their age are (though their insults are very old and 50's). I was their age not long ago, and was exactly like that. The ultimate example of the phrase ""boys will be boys"" is depicted in hilarious detail in this film. There is a sequence of gross- out humor when Gordie tells a story he wrote about a massively obese kid nicknamed ""Lardass,"" who takes revenge on his tormentors by entering a pie-eating contest with funny, but gross intentions. That scene is very, very disgusting, but is a silly, lighthearted way, and when you see it, you'll understand what I mean. Boys really love that stuff.The movie has a very tragic ending, that is still heartwarming. It really makes you cherish your friends more, and brings you closer to them. Every pre-teen should see this, but unfortunately, few kids I know actually enjoyed it. They usually thought it was corny and boring. This movie may be slightly sappy at times, but it is all for good purpose, and makes you feel great. Also, it is the complete opposite of boring. Every scene is interesting in some way. The scenes are either hilarious, heart-wrenching, or heartwarming. Sometimes even suspenseful. I cherish this movie, and recommend it to EVERYONE. Watch it now, and love it. 9/10.Stand By Me is rated R for Language Including Sexual References, and Some Crude Humor. Sex: 4/10 Violence: 5/10 Swearing: 7/10 Drugs: 5/10"
"Forget ""Casablanca,"" ""Schindler's List,"" or ""The Shawshank Redemption..."" This gem from the 80's takes the prize.With it's incredible acting, precise direction and wonderful story, ""Stand By Me"" stands alone as the brightest, most uplifting, personal and effective story ever told on screen.I remember the first time I saw it, I was 12 or so. I thought it was scary. Years later, I found out that the mighty Stephen King had penned the story and it made sense. It is so realistic and heartfelt, it's hard to imagine a movie ever surpassing this one. Each character represents one side of humanity and all of them beautiful and crafted to perfection. There is never a moment in the film that pulls you out. The story is so simple, it's timeless and appealing to everyone out there with a heart. It's about growing up and and it's about childhood innocence at the same time.I get the feeling that this movie was a deeply personal project and you can tell that everyone involved took it 100% seriously. Add to all this the fact that it shares the title of the best song ever written, (in my opinion,) and what you have is a miracle of a movie that will make you laugh, cry, laugh some more and leave the couch feeling like a new human being.10 out of 10, kids."
"Stand by Me (1986) **** (out of 4) Coming of age film about four friends (Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Connell) who set out to find the body of a missing teen. For my money this is the best coming of age film ever made because of how real it comes off. Perhaps I see myself and my friends in the role of these characters when we were their age but the movie has always struck me as being as true to teenage years as a film can possibly get. The bad language, the stuff the boys talk about and their looking for adventure is something any guy can connect with and I think this film delivers all the laughs, tears and drama of growing up.Each of the four boys are given great character development over the course of the 88-minute running time, which is pretty remarkable since the film doesn't run too long. We get to know each of the characters from their fears to their hopes for the future even though it's obvious that some won't ever reach their goals, which again, just falls back on how real the movie comes off. This is certainly one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King story and director Reiner handles all of it with great care and his visual style and song selections all hit the right mark. Another thing that keeps the film great are the performances by the four leads. Wheaton, Feldman and O'Connell all have some very tough scenes for such young actors but all pull them off without any trouble. The film belongs to Phoenix however as he clearly sticks out from the rest of the cast, which is saying a whole lot. The maturity he shows here is rather amazing to watch because there are actors twice his age that wouldn't be able to pull off the material here. The way the four boys work together makes their characters very memorable. The supporting players include future stars Kiefer Sutherland and John Cusack who also turn in great performances. Richard Dreyfuss appears in a few scenes and narrates the film and he does a great job. I think narration quite often ruins films but that's not the case here because Dreyfuss really puts his heart and soul into the narration and it really comes off as he's telling a story from his own childhood."
"Stand by Me (1986) This is coming-of-age drama film that tells the story of four boys in a small town in Oregon who go on a hike to find the dead body of a missing child. It is based on Stephen King's novella The Body. It stars Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, and Jerry O'Connell. Each has had a decent career following this movie. Unfortunately, Phoenix died at a young age. He was a genuine talent. This was one of my favorite movies when I was a child. I still watch it here and there, when the mood hits, or the internet is down. It's definitely one to have a copy lying about. The chemistry of the characters engross you into a story of friendship, the kind you miss over the years. These boys are on that cusp of being a child, and becoming a teenager. I possessed the luxury of seeing this as a child, so I will always relate. I strongly suggest this film for parents of children at that age. But it's not just for them. Adults will love this movie too. It's a perfect instance of how Stephen King can write something other than horror."
"There were so pretty great children actors. River Phoenix is the best out of them all. Steven King is a great writer but this book, ""the Body"", I feel, didn't translate well on the big screen. There was a good deal of funny moments and the music was a good touch. Some parts were very visually appealing. This movie lost points for me because I wasn't entertained by it.. This movie reminds the viewers that friends are what really matter in the world."
"I saw Stand By Me yesterday for the first time in one and a half years, (I'm 17) and I absolutely loved it, and it is definitely one of my favourite Stephen King adaptations. I will say I absolutely loved Shawshank Redemption, and despite the fact that it was unfaithful to the book, and badly flawed, I liked It too.Stand By Me, based on the novella by Stephen King, which I admit I haven't read, not only has a wonderfully engaging story, but it is both funny and moving. This is helped by the strong and wholly believable performances from the entire cast that include Kiefer Sutherland, John Cusack, Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Conell and River Pheonix especially.The script was very well-crafted, and the film tells brilliantly of the values of friendship and standing together. Other strengths were the beautiful photography and the fine direction from Rob Reiner. But what impressed me most about Stand By Me was not only its nostalgic feel, but despite the hour and a half running time, the characters particularly Chris were so well developed. And I mustn't forget the beautiful song Stand By Me over the end credits.A beautiful, unforgettable film, with a definite 10/10. Bethany Cox."
"I remembered watching this 20 some-odd years ago and what I remembered were three things:1.) I liked it 2.) The crossing the train tracks scene 3.) The leeches sceneI watched it again just yesterday and I can completely see my childhood fascination with this movie. But before I mention why I liked it I first have to ask... what is with Stephen King and children?Carrie, The Shining, Cujo, Firestarter, Cat's Eye, Children of the Corn, It, Stand by Me, et al. OK, granted, Stand by Me is nothing like the others, but it stars kids nonetheless. Stand by Me was a good ol' fashioned drama and I can see why I liked it and still like it. I got to see four foul-mouth pals take an adventure that I only dreamed of taking when I was that age. To have the freedom to just roam the woods with three of my best friends on a mission; that's little boy heaven. These four youth all had their problems but they were a band of brothers together. They laughed, cried, fought, played, roughhoused and everything else together; exactly what all regular boys do. There were no heroics, no real highs and no real lows just life. For all of the adults who forgot what it was like as a kid, Stand by Me is the reminder."
"After the death of his friend, a grown-up Gordie, now a writer, recounts a childhood journey. Gordie and three friends travel a long way to see the body of dead boy, and have several adventures on the way. I thought this movie was excellent. I thought it was a really nice, simple, unpretentious movie with themes that were really great, and really relevant. The characters, and some of the actors playing them, were amazing. River Phoenix stood out especially, he was a fantastic actor for his age, but the same applies to the other child actors; they brought the characters to life so well. I felt like I knew them all so well, and I suppose I do have friends, or know someone just like each of the characters. Although the characters were great, the one criticism I have about them is that they were a bit cliché and stereotyped. For example, the quiet artistic child whose brother died and whose father hates him. Or the fat, loser, woosey boy. But I suppose the characters are like that so we do relate and feel like we know each one of the characters. Apart from that, everything else was great. It wasn't too long or too short, and the story never seemed to lag. It's funny, hilarious even at times, but it's still touching, and sweet. The filmmakers and the actors manage to capture every aspect of childhood without being one of those awful, lovely, candy-coated, happy, Hollywood movies. The movie makes me feel lucky that I'm still young, and that I still can make the most of my life, but at the same time, it made me wish I was 12 again, that I was still innocent, and had friends like Vern and Gordie and Chris."
"This is virtually the definitive teen coming-of-age drama story filled with fondness for the 60s - (with a ripper soundtrack); and setting a major film trend in the late 80s/early 90s. It's poignant and melancholic with some comic asides - but definitely NOT the great fun comic story that most professional film critics ranked it as.***Spoiler warning***IMHO, the best comedy scene is the one where Chris and Gordie find the gun (""don't worry, it's not loaded..."")! The story Gordie tells is also funny, but the characters are very self-conscious about it, due to the fact that they're snickering all the way through it, which means it's not really funny for the audience.But one of the best proofs this is not a comedy is the climactic line ""We decided that an anonymous phone call would be sufficient"" - which I rank as one of the most anti-climactic lines in the history of cinema! After going through all the hassle and drama of the whole movie in order to become famous and get away from their drab lives. And after defeating the bullies and seeing the body, they just chuck it in at the end. If this was a comedy, the characters would have tried to become rich and famous (even though they probably would have failed.)By the way, in answer to one of the questions posed in the movie, Goofy is a dog. In fact, as an interesting bit of trivia, he was originally going to be called Dippy Dawg.Still this is a very good dramatic storyline about young teenagers going on an adventure and discovering things about life and themselves (even if that is an old plot line cliché). And I highly recommend viewers to check the the Mad magazine spoof version of this movie; it's a dead-set spot-on parody."
"Spoilers herein.The first duty of a filmmaker is to worry about how to transport the viewer into the special world they have in mind. The hard way to do this is by devising a very strong narrative. Expert filmmakers then worry about the identity of the camera.The simple way to do it is to just evoke a feeling, the bane of countless genre films. But sometimes you can strike gold by making `personal' films. Here is about the only one I can recall that works. It's very risky.This is a highly abstract film. Essentially nothing happens. The four characters exist without much visual reference to the rest of the world: some punks drift in and out, a junkyard worker, few others. Four characters, boys who are young enough to behave exactly as stereotypes and not have the audience revolt. The stereotypes go through just what one would expect, but that doesn't matter because that's not where the value is: it is all in the very fresh here and now and the dialog that creates the ephemeral moment.
Lots and lots of great one-liners. That's the magic of this project.Reiner knows this, or perhaps King. (I haven't read the story.) That's the point of the story within the story. The story has no real story to it, only a mood. If this were real boys it would be a diarrhea joke, but vomit is good enough. Reiner follows the hard rule that the story within the story has to be abstracted from the movie the same distance that the movie is from real life.Check out the berry connection.The comment from the listening boys is an inside joke: `but what happens to Lardass?' That story is the same type as this one. It is all about situation, not movement. All about not growing up, not about growing up. All about the moments, not the consequences of those moments: the junk man will call their Dads. The thugs will threaten violence. None of the boys will keep the secret of the body. Since we are relieved of the consequences, of the very notion of dynamic narrative, we can steep in an artificial zen of remembered childhood. It works.The only blot is Richard Dreyfuss whose job it is to frame this and provide the bridge to `reality.' What's needed is a writer's stance, someone who lives in the frame, not the framed. Instead, Dreyfuss places himself in the world of the kids. But his posturing, all his mechanical acting just dumps the stereotypes of the kids on his shoulders and on him it is not charming. The right stance would be that of Michael Douglas at the end of `Wonder Years.'"
"Rob Reiner's direction and a smart screenplay help make ""Stand by Me"" an impressive little film that over-achieves.  The cast is also strong.  Will Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, and Jerry O'Connell find out about a young boy who is missing deep in the woods.  They are almost certain that the young boy is dead and they want to find the body and become heroes. However, their journey causes them to see ""the big picture"" and they realize that they are doing the right thing, but for the wrong reasons.  Kiefer Sutherland and John Cusack add great supporting turns and Richard Dreyfuss makes an endearing cameo appearance.  River Phoenix is best though.  He shows great potential at a very young age and this film would lead to more impressive work before his unfortunate death.  A nice little film overall. 4 stars out of 5."
"Stand By Me (1986) was a pedestrian adaptation of the novella THE BODY. The direction by Rob Reiner was real good by the script was bad and it was too white bread for my taste. That's what I liked about the story, anyone could relate to it but when it's milked through by a hack writer and pacified for mainstream audiences it becomes bland and generic. But the acting form the kids was real good and it's watchable but not as great as soon many people make it out to be.STAND BY ME follows the main character Gordie as he relives his long lost childhood. A recent tragedy brings upon long lost memories of his old playmates. We relive that hot summer of 1960 and learn about the main characters and the trials and tribulations of growing up. One day, the summer of their innocence was lost forever when one of their friends tells them some news and takes them on adventure. A long one that re-examines their lives and what lies ahead of them in the future.Not a bad movie and not a classic. But if you're a fan of River Phoenix or his eighties running buddy Corey Feldman then you'll be in heaven. But fans of the book might not be that stoked about it."
"Stand By Me is a film that I consider incredibly overrated. I like quite a few of Rob Reiner's films, Spinal Tap and Princess Bride in particular. However, Stand By Me is just so pretentious and unpleasant to me, I can't find much in it to like. For child actors, the cast isn't actually too annoying, but that being said I didn't find any of the characters very likable and couldn't really get attached to them. Another thing I didn't like about this movie is that it's mean spirited. For a film about childhood, it seems to just be interested in countless instances of people hurting, destructing, bullying, etc, other people. Yes, I understand what it's going for/trying to say, but just can't get in to this overdone, pretentious movie that's not evenvery entertaining. This film annoys me, and the more I think about it the less I like it. Many people rave about Stand By Me, but I say it's not worth your time."
"I cannot believe this film is so highly rated! A terrific disappointment. It is impossible and unrealistic, but not presented as fantasy. The dialogue for twelve year old's is corny and stupid at times, or else ridiculously adult and philosophical. It is for the most part poorly acted, predictable and badly directed. Kids in Oregon in the fifties didn't behave like New York hoodlums. The cheesy ending, telling what happened to his friends was a cop-out and there was no resolution of the threat from the Cobras leader. There was also no resolution of Gordie's problems with his father and dead brother either. Altogether boring and a waste of time."
"I'm only 11 but last year when i watched it.it was great it was night i turned on the t.v and i started to watch it was nice and i also now river ""chris"" from another movie but it was after watching river from another movie i would now who he is anyway id probably wouldn't now who he is even if i did now him in this movie but this is a great movie trust me I'm remembering how great it is that now i want to get it on d.v.d i really liked this film but i now that this come from an 11 year old means nothing but don't come crying to me after watching this film telling me that you like the film and if you already did watch this film then you now what i mean and if you don't then watch the film agan"
"Stand By Me is a nice little movie, but it seemed average to me. I find it very confusing to see row after row of 10/10 star reviews for it. Ten stars is a pretty large scale to work with and I'm not sure I've seen a 10 star movie ever, because that would be pretty close to perfect. I would rate this film as average, or slightly above, but there are so many deeper and more entertaining films that aren't made as well out there. I'd rather watch something less well made but more entertaining, honestly.When I hear the rare criticism of this movie, it often involves the fact that this movie has very little plot. This is one thing I not only don't mind about the film, but applaud. Clearly, this film is about dialogue and nostalgia and those two aspects serve the coming of age theme the film strives for. A lot doesn't have to happen in a movie for it to be good or entertaining. But the film is mediocre in these important aspects. The re- creation of 1959 small town America comes up short. The looks, the haircuts, the dialogue just don't seem right. Perhaps I lived a sheltered childhood, but these kids would seem mouthy and brazen by today's standards and likely wouldn't exist in 1959. The dialogue feels very modern, as though 1980's style of speaking was flown into 1959 with a time machine. But, perhaps this is a minor flaw to be overlooked in favor of a broader look at the film's themes. I tend to think it is a major flaw because so much power rests on nostalgia, yet the kids seem overly bold to ring true and the time period seems wrong.Aside from the time period feeling fake and the kids seeming too bold and acid-tonged, there is a more general criticism here to be made. The film strives to be something of a general coming of age story that anyone can watch are relate to, but in doing so it becomes bland and generic. The characters seem like clichés with cliché problems: we have the sensitive, creative kid who's supportive older brother died, the tough kid with a heart of gold from the wrong side of the tracks, the feisty kid, and the fat dope. These prototypes are supported by Reiner with a heavy fist, when he finds time, sometimes in flashbacks. There is little to no time spent making a broader, more realistic portrait of any human in the movie, no attempt to go beyond archetypes. This makes all the crying and self exploration that occurs during the voyage seem a little empty and dull. As though the audience might forget that this is a coming of age film that leads to these kids becoming adults, we have to suffer through bookends and narration of grown Gordy, played by Richard Dreyfuss, spoon feeding us information with a very fake inflection. The excellent young actors try to save this film's messages and feel, while the bland sentimentality of Dreyfuss' presence seems to drag the film down. In the end, this film is a great forum to see excellent adolescent actors, but the power of their performances is brought down by the contrived feel and lack of depth in their surrounding stories. I found the scenes with crying slightly surreal, because as an audience we aren't given a strong enough feel for these characters and their backgrounds to have enough empathy to feel why they are crying (though we are told very clearly why). Reiner either spends time trying to support his material yet still fails to create a rich character, as in Gordy, or fails to spend any major time fleshing out, as in every one else. The result is a hand at once too light and too heavy. Reiner has done much better films. Slightly above average, 5 stars."
"I was born 25 years after this film was set, yet the single 1 thing that made me remember that this wasn't based in my own childhood years was the amount of food that Gordy managed to buy with their spare change. This films portrayal of childhood is so timeless and real.Most of us who saw this film can probably relate completely to this story. We too spent all day long trekking around outside, getting dirty, and yes-occasionally cheating death. (I'm sure we all have our own ""crossing the train tracks"" story...) Not carrying a wallet. Not thinking twice at the prospect of having to spend all day walking in the heat to get somewhere. Being gone all day, unsupervised, with no mobile phone to rely on if you got caught in a jam. There are so many scenes and pieces of dialogue that resonate so strongly as you watch this film.However, childhood nostalgia is not the only emotion you feel watching this movie. Learning about the lives and hardships of these characters is heart-rending to watch (particularly Gordy's personal reaction to the body, and River Phoenix's famous ""milk money"" scene). I can't think of another film starring child actors that has made me feel even a 10th of the emotion I felt during this movie. This is due largely to the fact that they managed to cast some great actors here. But I think also, the fact that these characters weren't predictable and 2-dimensional, like so many other children portrayed in films. Yeah, these are regular kids, who spend much of their days eating sugar and laughing at vomit stories. But that's not all they're about. They all have real problems and real emotions, and care about more than collecting baseball cards.This movie is bittersweet. It makes you laugh, and brings back so many fond memories, but it also makes you ache for your lost childhood, and the friends who shared it with you (who are now, as so accurately put, just ""faces in the hallway""). It also drives home the fragility of childhood innocence, and the harsh realities of life. Hearing the outcome of Chris's adulthood is one of the most boldly pessimistic things I've ever seen in a film. But hey-that's life.""I never had any friends later on, like the ones I had when I was twelveJesus, does anyone?"" True, how damn true."
"A complete waste of time. From the opening to the end, a narrator (it sounds like Richard Dreyfus's voice) utters cliché after cliché.I could parse it and present several examples but one will suffice since it isn't worth more time than that. When a junk yard owner insults a boy and his friends drag him away he calls for them to come back. For what? This would not and does not happen in real life. The mean old man should laugh. That's how it happens in life and how it should have be written but since the ""author"" had to present us with the bonding of the boys (saving one from suicide wasn't enough) he couldn't leave ""the plan,"" the plan he no doubt read in his copy of ""Screen Writing For Dummies."" The author seems to know exactly nothing about people except this: he wants to be a writer. In one pathetic scene (author's massage!) one of the boys suggest he might write about their pathetic little souls if he grows up to write.Why not? There was quite an important event they were witnesses to and, if you can't write about that, what can you write about?... assuming one can write.But this author can't. Still, the movie is something of a miracle. How did someone with such a bad script get the money to make this high-school level fluff? It's one thing to write about childhood but shouldn't the writer grow up first? Shouldn't he, at some point along the way, have learned something that can inform his important event with meaning?"
I'm from Willamette valley Oregon. When I saw this movie I was 9 and the surroundings looked like where I was from and was actually set and based there so instantly I was drawn to the film . But the characters feel so real so tangible . It's the only perfect film I've ever seen
"Stand by Me is based on one of my favourite Stephen King stories. It tells about a man remembering his youth in a small town where he and his three friends, all of them twelve and about to embark on different schools, decide to crown their last summer together by taking a trip down the railroad tracks in pursuit of a rumour about a dead body seen by the river. A sight that naturally appeals to the horror freaks in prepubescent boys.It is a quintessential Stephen King story in that the basic premise isn't all that complicated, a couple of lads walking down the tracks, but is filled with insight, purpose and life by the smallest of details given to his characters. I've rarely encountered more interesting, yet so believable characters than I have in his books. He's the one author that has made me realize that every single man or woman alive is interesting beyond belief if you only get to know him or her well enough.Unfortunately the novella is so bountiful and full of details that the movie seems pale by comparison. Most of the important plot points are referenced and acted out, but they don't reach the same emotional impact because details are missing and/or not given enough time to sink in. In addition the film suffers somewhat from the fact that all the main actors are children. They're very good child actors, Wil Wheaton and River Phoenix especially, but you can definitely see through their acting in most scenes.Nevertheless, it's an excellent movie to check out, even if you've read the original novella. It speaks about childhood through very unconventional means, but it rings no less true because of it. Quite the opposite. We really never have friends like the ones we had when we were twelve."
"The movie 'Stand by Me' (Rob Reiner) is coming of age film about four young boys. Throughout the film, they undergo many challenges and come to conclusions about their hometown, the world and themselves. All the boys are very different; there is at least one trait within each of the boys that everyone can relate to. This movie has a perfect combination of seriousness and the more immature and fun ways of youth. The characters deal with normal problems at the age of twelve as well as other problems like dealing with death, bad reputations and local myths. Some of the things they learn are discovered in a comical way and they learn the difference between myth and reality. The script is based on the novel ""The Body"" by Stephen King. Reiner closely follows the book but adds things here and there that make it much more exciting and relatable. The script is clever and well written. This movie is funny, emotional, suspenseful and a must see."
"The film ""Stand By Me"" is hands down one of my favorite movies of not only my childhood, but even still today. When I look back on my own youth around the years of 12-14, I can remember so clearly the moments portrayed in the film. Whether it be talking smack about our parents, running around all night saying we were each staying at different houses, or walking along the train tracks during the scorching summer days chucking rocks at the freights that passed by. I recall being skeptical at first about watching this so called ""classic,"" simply because of the fact that i was an adolescent girl and not some ""young dirty boy"" taking hikes to see dead bodies and smoking cigarettes along the way. But from the minute the movie started with all the boys' playing cards in the famous tree house to the moment where Chris Chambers fades away at his and Gordie's final goodbye, I could not help but get a thousand of overwhelming emotions passing through me. I laughed, I cried, I felt angry, and at times even surprised by some of the language that these thirteen year old boys were using. But that is the magic of it all. How often does a movie about pre-teen kids come along where there is no sugar coating, just a plain and real depiction of how all of us acted when we were that age. The average movie always leaves me laughing or feeling entertained for the night, but very so often a dime piece will come along that leaves you in awe feeling nostalgic for days about your own childhood. And then there are the actors - how could I possibly forget about them? River Phoenix with his heart-gripping scene about the milk money, Whil Wheaton so believably portraying a quiet and vulnerable boy who had lost his brother, Corey Feldman evoking so much anger and hurt through the words he says and the emotion in his eyes, and then Jerry O'Connell-just being plain old, clumsy Vern. Rob Reiner also did a fantastic job to have the ability to take a Stephen King novel and turn it into a heartwarming tale that still held the ""spooky"" element to it all. Filled with an outstanding cast and beautiful theme song, it is no wonder this is a movie I cannot seem to go a year without watching. It is definitely a must see for anyone who feels they want to relive their past every now and again. Like the famous quote says, ""I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was twelve. Jesus, does anyone?"""
"I was already well beyond my formative pre-teen years when I first saw this film, but there's no denying that if you grew up in small town America, this is about as close as you get to capturing the essence of childhood friendships that remain with you forever, even after time and distance take their eventual toll. Director Rob Reiner skillfully crafts a compelling tale from a Stephen King short story, layering it with various sub-texts that run the gamut from dealing with the town bully to confronting the loss of family. What's probably most remarkable about the picture are the performances that Reiner obtains from his young starring cast, most notably River Phoenix as Chris Chambers, and Wil Wheaton as his best friend Gordie Lachance. Told through the perspective of Wheaton's character, the film conjures up memories of the many trials and tribulations one faces while growing up, often unsure of oneself and even worse, feeling alone and disoriented when personal tragedy strikes and threatens to overwhelm one's very being. Yet the story never gets maudlin or depressing, there's enough youthful camaraderie and mischief on hand to keep the adventurous foursome going strong. Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell round out the group, and together they manage to grow and mature in a way that none of them could have imagined prior to starting their quest. Scored with a soundtrack that memorializes some of the great song hits from a half century ago, ""Stand By Me"" is a strange and wonderful journey, in it's own way reminding us of what might have been the best time of our lives. Sincerely."
"""Stand by Me"" is such an excellent coming-of-age story that I almost wish I'd grown up in the '50s. I can only imagine then, for anyone who has, the kinds of emotions through memories that the Stephen King novella-turned Rob Reiner film must evoke. Still, anyone who's gone through puberty can appreciate the adventuresome innocence yet underscored maturity of ""Stand by Me.""Taking place in the summer of 1959, the film is a childhood memory retold by Gordie Lachance (Dreyfus) of when he was 12 (played by Wil Wheaton) and he and three friends named Chris (River Phoenix), Teddy (Corey Feldman) and Vern (Jerry O'Connell) journeyed away from their Oregonian small town to find a missing teenager's dead body and fulfill an absent sense of adventure.Leaving behind their troubled home lives, the boys soon discover something else when they're out on their alone with only their own decisions to guide their actions. They make these choices together, quarrel together, look out for each other's backs and bare themselves emotionally in front of one another. You get the sense that if adults took this same journey that events would not have unfolded the same, with each man looking out primarily for himself. A boy, however, has nothing but his friends to help save him from a world that wants only to swipe his innocence away. That's the real power of childhood that this story unearths as it tries to understand that golden hue over our memories.Incredible, then, is Rob Reiner's achievement at making such a mature film about so much more than childhood with only children as the main characters. He captures these young boys on camera in a way that makes them appear like tiny sages helping us make sense of our own past. Having come only from rock mockumentary ""This is Spinal Tap"" at this point in his career, it's incredible the kind of performance Reiner gets from these boys.Young star Wheaton is instantly the boy we identify with most: he's quiet, doesn't pick on anyone, but commands the respect of his friends. Feldman, child star of the '80s, sheds his nerdy ""Goonies"" character to become the daredevil of the group, which he manages to excel at. O'Connell plays the scared fat kid who gets picked on the most and Phoenix, giving easily the best performance of the four, is the tough kid with a good head on his shoulders who is really sensitive inside. There's no doubt that if Phoenix hadn't died tragically in the '90s that he would've become a major acting force as an adult. John Cusack makes a cameo as Gordie's deceased older brother and Kiefer Sutherland also appears as Ace, the leader of a gang of teenagers who are also after the body, but this film belongs to the young ones through and through.Giving the children their authenticity are writers Raynold Gideon and Bruce A. Evans. These are normal pre-teenage boys above all else: they fight and pick on each other, have temper tantrums and occasionally break down into tears. Beautifully constructed is the metaphor of children following railroad tracks to an inevitable and shocking discovery.Stories about growing up are commonplace in Hollywood, but none will impress you like ""Stand by Me."" It's the only film starring children that serves adults first and that places it in a folder in history where it might never be touched again. It's really a treasure of a film."
"The movie is one of the greatest movies that I have ever seen. It's one of the movies that will touch you deep into your heart. It's what makes a movie amazing. The kids did an amazing job of acting out the characters of Teddy, Vern, Chris, and Gordie. It is an deep and does an an amazing job of reanacting the novella. The plot is amazing. It's the summer that every kid has to have. The one where the only thing that matters is being with your friends and having fun. Before everything else sets in. It tells of four best friends with all messed up family life's which mostly all they have is each other. Most definitely one of my favorite movies ever. It follows the boys as they journey to find something that will either make them or break them. What they are searching for is something that will make them local hero's. I thought that book was greatly amazing as the book. Stephen King did an excellent job on his part. But he never ceases to fail in my book. The cast was well chosen out for each part. Especially River for Chirs, and Corey Feldman for Teddy. They both did an amazing job adapting to there characters. This goes above and beyond of movies that friendship movies that go deep. Absolutely amazing."
"Stand By Me is the most excellent movie I have ever seen, and it definitely deserves a 10/10 without question. When I first saw it, I was amazed at how wonderful and unique this film was. It is absolutely the greatest Stephen King adaptation, and I think it is awesome how Stephen King liked some of the things better in the movie than what he wrote in the book. like when Gordie pointed the gun at Ace instead of Chris. I have never really cried during a movie until I saw this one. It is absolutely beautiful, and I love every second of it. All of the young actors put on memorable performances, especially the late River Phoenix. The adaptation was done brilliantly. If you have not seen this movie, I strongly suggest you do. It is pure genius."
"When I first saw ""Stand By Me"", a film of the coming-of-age experiences of four young pre-teen boys, I was in my pre-teens, trying to find my place in the world. Looks like the movie kicked me in the pants, so I could get somewhere in the world, and I thank it from the bottom of my heart.Based on the novella ""The Body"", from the collection ""Different Seasons"" by Stephen King, the story introduces us to the four main players who live in the town of Castle Rock, Oregon, circa 1959. Sensitive, wunderkind scribe Gordie Lanchance (Wil Wheaton of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"") still mourns the accidental death of his understanding jock brother Denny (a young John Cusack) while being ""invisible"" and ""a disappointment"" to his equally mournful parents; tough kid Chris Chambers (strong River Phoenix of ""Little Nikita"" and ""Dogfight"") tries to be a good kid, despite coming from a family of reprobates.Wild-eyed and hearted Teddy Duchamps (Corey Feldman of the ""Lost Boys"" films) vocally dreams of army service, wanting to please his mentally unstable, abusive, WW II vet father, who burnt the boy's left ear against a hot stove, and goofy coward Vern Tessio (Jerry O'Connell of ""Sliders"" and ""Crossing Jordan"") who provides loyalty and comic relief to the group. He also tells them about the location of a dead boy's corpse, after inadvertently hearing it from his older scumbag brother and a friend.This leads to a two-day trek for the four, during Labor Day weekend, through the Oregon wilderness. They seek fame and adoration, but they find themselves, especially during a dramatic moment over the corpse with a band of knife-wielding hoods, led by town bully Ace Merill (Kiefer Sutherland, who was probably practicing his future, iconic lead role on the hit, serialized TV action drama ""24""). Growing up isn't a solid timetable.Director Rob ""Don't call me Meathead"" Reiner (""This Is Spinal Tap"", ""A Few Good Men"", ""The Bucket List"") hugs the Oscar-nominated adapted screenplay by Bruce A. Evans and Raynold Gideon (""Starman"", ""Mr. Brooks"") tender and tense, funny and tragic, humble and honest, beautiful and poignant, sweet and thoughtful. In their pre-teens at the time, the four players perfectly play their roles, reminding us of ourselves. Wheaton's Gordie is a reflection of me, and I decided to be a writer, after seeing the film. The pie-eating tale he tells to his buds over a campfire is a hoot and a half.However, it's the performance by Phoenix (who should have been also Oscar-nominated for echoing James Dean and Marlon Brando) that's forever haunting since he and his role met unfortunate demises, making the film all too powerful. Heart-breaking is the moment when he tell Gordie-crying-about a good deed he did, but goes wrong due to his family's rep.Kudos have to be given to Rick Dreyfus (""Jaws"", ""Silver City"", ""W"") who narrates the film and plays the adult version of Gordie, a successful writer with his own kid, who notes to a friend how weird he gets when he's writing. The 1950s rock music soundtrack suits the film and is enjoyable, even to those who didn't grow up in the era.Though I didn't have friends, let alone close ones, growing up because I was (and still am) a weird, ""old young man"", I look at my childhood, and like others, find it temporary. I wish my friendships were like Gordie and Chris: eternal (despite one's passing, in the case of the film). Go see this classic, even with your kid (the underage smoking and profanity were part of King's life as a boy) and remember your childhood."
"As I read the other comments and think about this film's effect on me -- the fact that before I even sought out IMDb I immediately recognized the 'River Phoenix character' in my own life: a pal called Babe, whom I have tried in vain to relocate, now nearly 70 years after our 12-year old childhood days -- but yes, we had that kind of friendship, in my own recall; he gave me the confidence to fight back, against a bully, which meant a whole lot, in my young years. But what I was about to say is that I suddenly see something almost archetypal in the kind of situation recognized by so many others, and myself, as the age-12 friendship scenario.Now that I can look back over an entire life, it is possible to see the elements that seemed so distinctive at the time, and are remembered as so personal, so unique, as actually being very characteristic of a time-of-life. And to see them so uniformly recalled convinces me that this is so. We already know a few such passages: the midlife crisis, and the sentimentally romantic teenage years (as certified by the pop music that is forever afterward what we favor best and return to most). Similarly, then, is there an idealized moment directly at the crossover between childhood and being what we call grown-up. In fact, it is the final passage of childhood, after which nothing is ever quite so wonderful. We get 'drafted by life' . . . channeled into careers, relationships, professions, family concerns, and not to forget: debts and mortgages and the passion for 'getting ahead'. But before all that begins, life has left with us something richly remembered as an idealized friendship. It is really love, however, before it becomes sexual. And that precious slice of it will always be back there as a kind of prototypical ideal, for challenging comparison with every other relationship we ever have in our lives. It's back there to model our future connections . . . for as long as we can retain the ideal. As I now see it, that's what this film, along with the comments on it, has revealed to me."
"In all of the films i have ever seen, never have i seen a film that has left such an impression as 'Stand by me'. I've seen many 'coming of age' films, but 'Stand by me' just had that something, that something special.Maybe, the reason it was so brilliant was because of the extremely talented cast. It's rare to find a film with such purity, where the actors use each other to make their performances better. Especially considering the cast were so young, they do such a professional job.I can really relate to this film, as can everyone. It contains the four main stereo-type high school kids: the crazy/strange one (Teddy), The 'wimp' (Vern), the intelligent/sensitive one (Gordie) and the tough guy that no-one can be bothered to get to know (Chris). It's hard for somebody not to like this movie as you can relate to at least one aspect of it.Although there are quite a few wrenching scenes, it's not 'mooshy' or 'cliche' at all. Instead, it's the opposite. It portrays it truthfully, in a bare form in which really makes you think about your own childhood. I went away after watching this film feeling speechless. I couldn't believe how amazing it was. And i'm so glad i watched it at the age of 14, so that i could really appreciate my childhood. Anybody who hasn't seen this film is seriously missing out on life."
"It's been a really long time since I'd seen an actual good movie, and for me to pass up a classic like this would not only go against my principles, but it might as well be a mortal sin.There are many reasons to like this movie... and not just because it's based on a Stephen King novel, but also because it practically mirrors a time in all our lives. That, and because narrative movies have always fascinated me.The only real disappointment is that these kinds of movies tend to have the same problem: they're not as lengthy as many people would like.I shouldn't have to even give one of my verdicts, but it's a specialty of mine.9 out of 10"
"It was 1987 when I first went to see this flick and in fact wondered why I saw it THREE times? Later it occurred to me this was a coming of age film and anyone from 18-80 who is a man, probably has some unconscious baggage about such hard, yet unforgettable experiences.I recently got a 50 inch plasma so thought, why not get some of the films I recall as classic.I very much enjoyed River Phoenix as a kid, who was 16, but in the film looked not a day over 14.The sad and prophetic part, is where River walks away and vanishes down the road forever.Isn't this what time does for us? Just as we realize we have had an experience, its over and gone, who knows where."
"Since a few months before, I had tackled on true art cinema. Kicked back again in true classics like Amadeus, Cinema Paradiso and started new ones like The Graduate. And I have seen almost all Anderson films, (I will see There Will Be Blood tomorrow) And talking about Anderson, I think that is a good example for what I'm trying to say. When I watch Magnolia or Boggie Nights, there are scenes that, I just keep silence, I don't know why. Wheter if I have no words, or I'm shocked, I keep silence for almost the entire film. And then, all the rest of the day, I think about that film, saying nothing, even thinking nothing, just ""feeling"" the movie. Well, that's the exact case with Stand By Me. I first saw it when I was like 8 years old, and I didn't catch it, I didn't like nor hate it, nothing. Just a movie. Yesterday, I bought the DVD, I saw it this morning and now I'm in silence. The story in Stand by Me is actually simple: in a small US town, end of the 50's, a small group of 12-almost 13 year old boys escape on the search of a teenager's dead body, so they can come back home and be awarded as heroes. Easy thing. Sho why is this so special? It's not the story, is the characters. Based on Stephen King's The Body, director Rob Reiner grabbed a cast of kids that, in my opinion, wheren't actors playing those characters but rather those characters in the flesh, with their pros and cons. Stand By Me is just a classic film about growing up, and if we aren't kids all."
"Feldman at the beginning of their careers. The entire cast is superb and it so perfectly paced, that the story unfolds with wit, pathos and sensitivity and completely free of emotional shortcuts.The subsequent early death of one of the young stars serves to make this story of friendship even more poignant, and the end has added extra impact.The tale itself, adapted from a Stephen King story, dwells on the mates' quest to find the body of a schoolboy supposedly struck down by a train while walking in the woods. They set off hoping to find fame, but then start to reveal their own personal secrets and the journey becomes as emotional as it is physical.It's hard to tell if the four young actors are all geniuses or just perfectly cast, but the performances are never short of real, and if some of the key scenes don't have you choking back tears, you are without a soul."
"I loved Stand By Me, a great childhood adventure film which shows how growing up can be tough, fun, exciting & life changing. Now i'm a bit older the movie reminds me about how great it was being a worry free kid with so much to explore, and how the word boredom barley existed. I guess watching it these days could make me a little jealous & depressed that my childhood is over, but in the best possible way. Its always good to look back and smile, even if you can't turn back the clock.The acting was great, especially from Corey Feldman & Keither Sutherland who both have roles within other movies in my top 20 list as well, i really think it deserved an Oscar and not just a nomination but an 8.1 on IMDb is just as rewarding i guess :)i too give it an 8/10."
"Isn't it interesting that the best stories Stephen King ever come up with are drama instead of horror. Stand By Me, or actually the novella The Body as its called, is the greatest of them but there are others too. The Shawshank Redemption -story for example. Considering that these two plus two more novellas (Apt Pupil and one more, which doesn't strike my mind right now) are included in Different Seasons makes the book a wonderful piece of art.I'm quite a nostalgic fellow and things about friendship concerns me a lot. Maybe that's why this movie gives me such kicks. But also, in this movie it seems like even all the small thing matches perfectly.The actors are perfect. The young fellows, including the late River Phoenix, are great. My favorite is probably Teddy Duchamp played buy Corey Feldman but also the others do a nice job. Kiefer Sutherland is fantastic as the tough guy with his stupid disciples. One of my favorites is John Cusack as the main characters dead brother and then of courses Richard Dreyfuss as the narrator.Also the pace of the movie is so fantastic. There are a few fast-paced dj-lines on the radio and a lot of pop and rock music but still the tempo of the movie is slow and calm as life itself in an almost forgotten small town as Castle Rock.When watching the movie you soon start to realize that the important issue is not finding the dead kids body but all the small things which happen along the way and the stories which are told by the becoming author. To me the climax is in the ending (as it should be in good movies). The storyteller sits in front of his computer and reminisces. He writes down the line: ""I've never had any friends later on, like the ones I had when I was twelve. Jesus, does anyone."" Then he shuts the computer and goes out playing with his kids as we hear Ben E. King sing his beautiful Stand By Me - hit. One of the best endings ever in a movie.Only death ends the sadness of life."
"This is my first review on IMDb so I had to review my personal favorite movie of all time, Stand By Me. This film is just downright flawless. It's got action, laughs, suspense, and a whole lot of drama. The storyline is one that I can relate to has inspired me to do many things over the years. Four friends go out on a hike to try and find a missing person and in the process learn much more about themselves. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you just might like me end up becoming inspired. If you like dramedies, see it. If you're a Stephen King fan who read the novella, definitely see it. If you just love movies in general, see this movie!"
"After having read the short story ""The Body"" by Stephen King!.I have to say that I feel this film is a very good adaptation of the story.And in some parts improves on the story. The Plot: After his main friend had been killed.Writer Goride Lochance,looks back on a summer in Castle Rock.When he was in his pre-teens.That summer he and three friends (Chris,Teddy and Vern).Who are also helping to support Gordie after his brother sadly died.One day Vern hears his brother and his friends talk about finding a body.The body is of Roy Bower,Who the police have been looking for as a missing person for along time.So Gordie and his friends go on a adventure, and a coming-of-age for all of them. View on the film:The Screenplay: Written by Raynold Gideon and Bruce A.Evans.They make sure the the film moves at a very fast pace. (I feel the short story took a bit to much time to get really going)While most of the flashbacks from the short were taken out,I feel,it makes the movie a lot more easier to know whats happening in the plot.They also make sure to keep the ""strong"" dialogue scenes from Kings story,while adding really great ones that blend in well with the story (""If Plutos a dog,then whats Goffy?).The only bit that I am unsure about is why the ending was changed,from all of the friends dying,to just one of them.This still has to be,one of the best adaptation of Kings work (wich are usually a bit,lets say ""shacky) but this one stands out great.The cast: All of the cast (who were mostly unknown at the time)all work great together,and make you feel that they are really a group of friends.The main part of the film,that you feel the actors brought a lot in and made stronger,is the relationship with Gordie (Wil Wheaton) and Chris (the late River Phoenix),who both in there ""breakdown"" scenes show great emotion and make the characters more real.The events that happened to Phoenix in real life,makes the ending a lot sadder,then what it was meant to be.Kiefer""24""Suthland,does a really good job in this at playing a very strong,creepy bad guy.(Which is something he used again for The Lost Boys).Direction:Directer Rob Reiner(who would re-team with King,to do Misery),does a really good job at making the setting feel like a very real small town.He also does a really good job at knowing t focus on the people and the story,and not just fill the screen with lots of gore (something that most people get wrong when making a Stephen King story into a film). Final view on the film:The first and still,one of the best book-to-screen movies.And one for anyone who has any great friends will enjoy seeing,or being a fan of Its A Wonderful Life style movies."
"Just a note - I wrote this for a school project. I would never have the patience to write something this long otherwise.Stand By Me ***** out of 5 DVD edition Viewed March 4, 2005 Based on Stephen King's bestseller The Body Directed by Ron Reiner Dead Bodies, Vomit, Bloody Leeches, Swearing, Knives and Cigarettes: Why This is the movie for your family By Rachael C., FILMAttention parents! What do you want most for your children? Do you want them to become young, successful and aspiring people? Is it your only wish that Joey and Larissa go out into the wide, wide world and inspire other young people as you inspire them? If so, the 89 minutes of film, which stars the young, successful and aspiring River Phoenix, Will Wheaton, Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell, is for them.But it's full of dead bodies, barfing, bloody leeches, swearing, knives, and cigarettes!, you say. This is not entirely true. The film, released in 1989 by Columbia Pictures, is not merely about a group of friends who travel along a rail track to find a dead body they have heard about. Themes of heroism, self-confidence and friendship are packed together in hilariously heart warming scenes that flow cleanly form frame to frame. Stand by Me is good for both you and your kids to see because of its realistic plot, the talent of the actors and the youthfulness of the movie.The adventure is seen from the point of view of Gordie Lachance (Will Wheaton) who throughout the trip is tortured by the memory of his older brother, who had just died recently. Chris Chambers (River Phoenix), Vern Tessio (Jerry O'Connell) and Teddy Duchamp (Corey Feldman) all struggle with problems of their own.This movie is what is known as a ""coming of age film"" featuring characters around 11 to 15 years of age who discover something new about themselves and who they can become through the progress of the story. You may find yourself relating to one of the characters during this movie because the script is incredibly realistic. This reality that you are forced to watch is what will make you both laugh and cry. The way the characters react to each other and the obstacles they face are ways you will remember yourself or your friends reacting. These could just be the facial expressions or words they use, but it conjures up memories of your own childhood. The impeccable performance of the actors in Stand by Me brings in another aspect of realness. The characters are believable, especially in their speech. Although the kids use what is considered to us ""foul language"", it is how kids of that setting (1950's, fictional town of Castle Rock, Oregon) spoke. The emotions of the audience are constantly changing as each character struggles with his own problems. The main theme of this movie is youthfulness and the friendships we possess at the time. It relishes in both the beauty and the pain of being a kid, as the four friends sing songs at the tops of their lungs, swim in mud, and hold spitting contests, but also experience death, the sheer terror of getting run over by a train and the loss of things special to them(Gordie's hat that his brother gave him). This movie is one your kids will learn something from. And maybe you will learn something from it too. As Teddy Duchamp says, ""This is my age. I'm in the prime of my youth and I'll only be young once."" Stand by Me will help you relive your youth."
very possibly the best film i have ever seen. i cant think of a single film that made me want to be a part of it as this did. i read the book long before i saw the film and was very impressed by how closely Rainer stuck to the original text. what i think is interesting about this film is it is basically a road movie a buddy film but because of the age of the kids they have to walk in fact at the end they fell a great injustice has been done when their big brothers just drive in an afternoon and accomplish what they spent two days doing. i have long been a fan of Corey Feldman (petered out by bordello of blood) and fell this is his best performance. must have watched it ten time and will watch it ten times more.
"Stand by me shows a time of innocence not only through the astounding acting from the four main characters but from the setting of the film and also from the soundtrack. Set in the 50's, stand by me follows four boys: Chris Chambers(River Phoenix), Geordie Lachance(Will Wheaton), Teddy Duchamp(Corey Fieldman) and Vern Tessio(Jerry O'Connel)on there journey to fine the body of a missing boy. On their way they encounter many obstacles both mentally and physical ones that bring the boys closer together. Based on the novella ""The Body"" by Stepehen King, Stand by me shows what true coming of age is really about, Friendship and fun. A truly magnificent film that is a definite must watch!"
"Stand by Me was a movie that truly blew me out of my socks. I saw it first when I was very young and I thought it was great, but completely forgot about it. Over the years, I thought less and less about it until I came across it again one day. I popped it in to see what I had forgotten about, and I found myself crying more than once. It sent a message that children should be receiving very early on. It's a movie about friendship and loyalty. I think my favorite scene was the 'Milk Money' scene. I found myself crying with Christopher Chambers about his dramatic loss and how everyone thought nothing of the 'low-life Chambers kid.' This movie is essentially about four boys looking towards one goal. To be a hero by finding the missing body of Ray Brower and to be redeemed in their town's eyes. And when they set out on their 2-day trek, they learn things about each other that they never knew before. They learn that in each other's eyes they're all equal, and that's all that matters. They learn that they don't need to be redeemed in each other's eyes, because all of them have enough issues with themselves to be able to worry about the issues they have with their friends. But when the rival gang sets out with the same goal and they meet in that last scene, the whole movie pulls together to its ultimate climax. And this group of boys makes for a fun, dramatic and hilarious movie. Teddy Duchamp and Chris Chambers, both doomed to a life of misery by their deranged or angry fathers. Vern Tessio, the sacredly cat with a brother in their rival gang, and Gordie Lachance, perhaps one of my favorite characters in this movie, and the narrator. Gordie is the sensitive writer who just wants a little love from his parents after his brother died in a jeep accident. He was one of the characters that made me cry most, along with Chris.Chris and Gordie are the best of friends, which is something that I think sends out a good message as well. Having a best friend whose shoulder you can cry on and who will always try to be there with you if you ever, in slightly dramatic terms, have a mental breakdown. This movie is highly recommended. Definitely worth seeing, as it has turned into one of my favorites. Especially that one last line:'I never had friends later on in life like the ones I had when I was twelve. Jesus, does anybody?'"
"Stand by Me adapted from the 1981 novella, written by Stephen King, The Body, is a allegory for any person that wants to spend the last weekend with their chums and engage on an odyssey that demonstrates honesty and aspiration. The nexus between the four main friends is both kind and noble. The way the film's narrator, who is played by legendary film actor Richard Dryffus (apologize for any misspelled words and erroneous grammar)who plays one of the young boys grown up as a writer, and how he sees in the beginning of the film those two boys on the bike allows him to reflect on his childhood and how friendship is eternal. The last ten minutes of the film, for me, are the most memorable and emotional when Chris Chanmbers, played by the late River Phoenix, is described by Richard Dryfus as being killed to try to settle a dispute, which reflects Mr. Chambers kind and conciliatory character, which was greatly accentuated by Mr. Phoenix understanding and passionate role. Thank you to Rob Reiner, Stephen King and the entire cast and filmmakers working on the film."
