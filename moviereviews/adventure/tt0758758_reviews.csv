"I'm finding it hard to see why this film has taken such a tongue lashing (or keyboard lashing) by some people...mostly it is said that the main character is selfish and self indulgent, and that this film builds him up to be some kind of hero..but I think that's missing the point...through-out I was thinking about how, on one hand it was admirable that he wanted to break from the materialistic, money grabbing oppressive shackles placed on us by modern society, but on the other, how he had gone about it in such an irresponsible, hurtful and self-righteous way...the way he abandoned his parents and loving sister without a phone call note or explanation, and from the people he met along the way, like the kind old man and young romance, especially compounded this...and ultimately he realised this at the end by scribbling into a book, ""happiness only real when shared"" surely that is the lesson here! that his selfish, hurtful adolescent behaviour was wrong, and he ultimately paid a terrible cost.So ignore that haters...they are looking at this story the wrong way! Very much worth an open minded viewing!"
"I've never posted a comment regarding a movie but feel compelled to after attending a screening of Into The Wild at the Toronto Film Festival last night. I won't speak to story here as it's covered in the other comments.This is a movie of real beauty. It made me cry. I felt moved in a way that happens very rarely. It was an inspiration.The feelings it evoked were all based on the power of the acting and the writing. The words were real and human. The relationships seemed real and human. This may not seem like a great feat - but I consider it a true rarity. It didn't feel calculated and artificial, like so many movies (read: Crash - but I'm not here to bash that...). It was very organic, natural and (I can't say it enough) just beautiful. Cripes, it's making me sound like a hippie, for heaven's sake. This for me was Penn's best work since Indian Runner.What it reminded me of...Terence Malik - Herzog? - in a strange way Cassavettes? - Hal Ashby (more Coming Home than Harold & Maude...) - even a bit of Ken LoachRuby in Paradise - Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore - Five Easy Pieces - Easy Rider... but when I list those it's not because of plot similarities (though there are some) or style (although I think you can definitely see the influence of some great films) - it's again because of the heart of it. I heard a few people at the screening comment that the film was ""too long"" but I don't agree. I think exploring a journey of this magnitude required visiting all of the people he touched and taking the time to see the land.Hal Holbrook was just perfect, as was the cast as a whole, and I think Emile Hirsch is really going places - he was fantastic and he owned the role. Eddie Vedder's music worked perfectly as well - not distracting or quirky - just a part of the whole.The film received a standing ovation and quite a few tears were shed. Magic."
"Sean Penn's new movie Into the Wild arrives on the wave of a well-regarded novel about a college graduate who decides that the anger and violence in civilized society is too much to handle and commences a journey through nature in order to truly live life as it was meant to be. This film is a wonderful glimpse into the life of a kid, wise beyond his years, and the bonds that he creates with people along the way. A victim of excess in wealth and a shortage of love, Christopher McCandless hid inside his mind behind knowledge and philosophy, building up his intellectual strength, as well as the physical, in order to complete his trek, ultimately leading him to Alaska. Penn never falls into the trap of showing too much heartbreak on the side of McCandless's parents, because he doesn't want the audience to second-guess the decision he made. There is no debate to be had here, our protagonist has no alternative but to get out and live off the land. Only being completely self-sufficient can he grasp a meaning for his life and one day perhaps go back with that knowledge fully learned.Emile Hirsch is absolutely brilliant with his good-natured attitude and affable charm. His character believes that human contact is not necessary for happiness and never seeks out relationships. However, his character is so likable that they find him and latch on, not to change his mind, but to experience his level of being and hopefully learn something from him and help enlarge his vocabulary on life. The people he meets help him to fully grasp the decision of life in the wild and be able to survive it. Never coming off condescendingly to those he crosses paths with, Hirsch always holds a smile on his face. One scene, where he meets up with a couple of people from Europe, proves how contagious a clear outlook on life without the troubles of societal restraints can be. These three kids have a blast, if only for a few minuteswith Hirsch being chased by the police for rafting with no licenseand it makes one wonder if maybe we all should take a journey into nature and feel the freedom and full warmth of heart that a lack of stress to succeed in the business world can give.All the supporting players are magnificent at helping show the side to McCandless that Penn needs on display to succeed. Hal Holbrook, Brian Dierker, and Catherine Keener are by far the best of these side characters with Vince Vaughn and Kirsten Stewart adding some charm too. Dierker, Keener, and Stewart play hippie, flower-child type roles and allow Hirsch to show off how modest and unselfish he is. This is the family he deserved to have from birth and he is the son they wished their lives had earned them. At their best, all four together give some of the most emotionally charged moments in the film. Holbrook, on-the-other-hand, helps give insight into the philosophy that Hirsch needs to live with in order to survive the loneliness, looking him in the face, to come in Alaska. It is truly fascinating to see how every person adds something to his overall experience and to the tools he needs.Hirsch deserves a lot of credit because he truly outshines the film itself with his dedication and sacrifice to the role. The length of time needed to allow him the ability to lose the weight necessary for a main plot point in the movie is crazy. If the time wasn't that long and Hirsch did it all rapidly, I'm even more impressed. With all that, there are many instances free of dialogue that he needs to carry with body language and actions alone. True, much of this is enhanced by a wonderful soundtrack from Eddie Vedder, but evenso it is a remarkable performance. Kudos to Sean Penn for a gorgeous filming job also. He captures the countryside with grace, while infusing many moments of visual style by slow-motioning glimpses, knowing when to show the family left behind, utilizing informative and essential voice-over, and even breaking the fourth wall. When Hirsch first looks into the camera, at the audience, it does not seem unnatural in the slightest, but instead an amazing link for the viewers to take a look into his soul like those that crossed his path have. McCandless is so pure that it almost feels like glimpsing the calm protectiveness of God."
"The sensitivity with which Krakauer captured the essence of McCandless and his adventure is extended aptly to the movie format by Sean Penn. Even if one might not be able to appreciate the purpose for Alex's journey, I don't think anyone would be able to deny that Into the Wild is a sensitive and poignant cinematic experience. There are scenes in this movie that one will never be able to forget, particularly the ending sequence. This movie will easily pull its audience into a philosophical debate for the truth about who was right and wrong isn't easy to distinguish. Sean Penn certainly doesn't try to answer those questions, questions that McCandless' life left for his family and the rest of us. Penn does well to tread a delicate objective but not indifferent line. Certainly the best movie of this year and one of the best ever made. The story, the story itself is great."
"For a movie to be even better than a good book is no small feat. Yet, that's how I felt after watching this film. It really impressed me. One of the reasons is the fantastic cinematography. Man, this is a beautifully filmed and, at 142 minutes, there are a lot of great scenes to admire.Sean Penn directed and Eddie Gautier was the Director Of Photography. I can't stand Penn as a person but fair-is-fair and I think he's great as a director, having seen his work in ""The Pledge"" and ""The Crossing Guard."" The main actor, Emile Hirsch, who plays ""Chris McCandless"" (a.k.a. ""Alexander Supertramp"" reminded me of Leonardo DiCaprio with his looks, build and voice inflection. He is very credible as the young guy who wants nothing to do with materialistic society and dreams of living in the wilds of Alaska. The problem was that he was unprepared and underestimated what he was up against.Two people who fascinated me the most in here were two extremes, age-wise - Hal Holbrook and Kristen Stewart. It was really great to see the veteran Holbrook (""Ron France"") again. He was about 82 when he made this film and hadn't acted in a film in a few years. He was terrific, too. He had some of the most memorable scenes in the story. Meanwhile, teenager Stewart was captivating as ""Tracy Tatro,"" who had a crush on ""Alex."" This young woman is on her way to stardom.Brian Dierker and Catherine Keener also were really, really interesting as the aging hippie couple, ""Rainey"" and ""Jan."" I kept thinking, I know this guy when listening to Dierker's voice, finally guessing it was Jeff Bridges underneath all the beard....but it Dierker, a guy who rarely acts in films.Knowing the book, the only part of the film that caught be off-guard was the young Swedish couple. I don't remember them in the book but I'll never forget this in this film!! One could debate the pros and cons of Chris McCandless for hours, so no sense going into that here. I thought the film was pretty kind to him. You read more in the book about how he hurt a lot of people with his silence. Either way, it's a a fascinating story and a beautiful film."
"INTO THE WILD definitely works as a film - I had read the book so I certainly knew the tragic story of this young man's life but I was blown away by the performances. In fact, to have this young talent Emile Hirsch working with the old, legendary Hal Holbrook makes the film a must see - in fact, their scene near the end in the truck is one of the best pieces of acting I have ever seen on film - Holbrook is amazing there. He deserves a Best Supporting Actor nomination (but probably won't get it). The film is by no means perfect - there are pacing problems but Penn does use the flashbacks incredibly well and the film builds power as it goes along. Hirsch is so real - I remember noticing how talented he was in the indie flick Dangerous Life Of Altar Boys and I also thought he was very good in the so-so Alpha Dog film. But Penn gets a terrific performance out of him as well as Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn, Wm. Hurt, Kirsten Stewart, jena Malone and everyone else for that matter. I can see how this film might not be for every one, but I was very moved by it and days later - certain images and moments stayed with me. Penn is getting better as a filmmaker with each movie he makes."
"Christopher McCandless lived a silly life and died a silly death. Here was a guy who gave his savings to Oxfam, left home without uttering a word to his family and who thought salvation lay in the wilderness. Too bad, then, that he ate the wrong type of plant and carked it.All the time we're told what complete bastards McCandless' parents are. They drove Christopher into the wild. But what was their crime? Apparently they argued some, even lied a little and their children were born out of wedlock. Okay, they're not the best parents in the world, but do they deserve the harsh treatment that their son dishes out  no letters, no postcards, no phone calls? Well, if you're a massive jerk and you're somehow unable to comprehend that human relationships are more complicated than a simple 'they're good' or 'they're bad', then you may be able to build a case for young Christopher, but if you have any depth of feeling in your soul, you may well think that McCandless punished his parents beyond anything that is reasonable. And also remember that he never contacted his beloved sister. She got the silent treatment as well. However, we have a scene where Christopher goes to call her, but instead he gives his quarter to an old man who is running out of change. What a great guy, we're asked to think. See how he lends a helping hand to strangers. But what about his poor sister, the person who loves him most in the world? This apparently is his one feeble attempt to reach out and tell her that he's okay.But no, Christopher is determined to live alone in the wilderness - to find himself. He wants to escape from a sick society where people treat each other poorly. Hell, his parents even have the nerve to offer to buy him a new car and pay for a Harvard education. Those phonies. Those shallow fakers who give him a home to live in and money to spend. How disgusting they are.Okay, so fair enough, the parents that we're presented with here are stiff, middle class dweebs who are more interested in appearances than anything of any substance, but what had me shaking my head was the assertion that Christopher's disappearance made them better people. Suddenly they're thoughtful and united and in tune with one another. Yes, that's what every strained marriage needs  their children to put them through a couple of years of hell.But what I find most objectionable is the romanticising of the wilderness. Is this the only way that anyone can find themselves, by opening their arms and standing on the edge of a mountain and by kayaking down a river? Isn't there any other way? Apparently not. We even get a scene where Christopher, briefly stranded in LA, looks into a restaurant populated by smarmy bastards and sees a yuppie version of himself. You see what he'd become if he stayed in the city? Hunting moose and talking to hippies is the only way to become a rounded individual.But the disaffection with society in this film is incredibly adolescent. In one scene, Christopher and a buddy of his just start impotently shouting 'society!' Yeah, society sucks and the wilderness is great. The wilderness never starved anyone, ate anyone or froze their balls off. In the eyes of every bear and moose is truth and beauty, and on the cold streets of civilisation is a steady flow of lies and deceit.However, at the end, Christopher maybe finally begins to understand that his quest is full of crap. He writes something along the lines that happiness is meaningless if you don't have someone to share it with. It took you all that time to figure that out? That human connections are what make life bearable? You could have found that out back home, sitting on your couch in your underpants, stuffing Cheetos down your throat.But of course, it's the journey that matters, isn't it? And what a tedious journey it is. Christopher meets hippies and quirky foreigners (who are good) and men with badges (who are bad). He helps people like a shaggy-haired Littlest Hobo and enjoys the milk of human kindness. Well, he enjoys the milk of human kindness as long as the people are poor. Everyone who has no money in this film is an insightful, kind-hearted, itinerant poet. Plus none of the hippies he meets are smelly, ugly, incoherent bastards who drown in their own drug-fuelled nonsense. No, they're inspiring people, who plaster their vehicles with outdated sentiments like 'freedom', 'peace' and 'love'.But it's notable that there's a moment when even a bear won't eat Christopher. Supposedly the bear turns his nose up at him because the kid stays calm or perhaps because he's so sick he doesn't smell that good. But I'd like to think that the bear turns his nose up because it's BS he can smell, and lots of it.However, as we all know from Timothy Treadwell, bears don't mind a bit of BS, but alas the film can't even come close to the genius of Grizzly Man, a film that shows you're no closer to finding reality in the wilderness than you are on the city streets. The problem here is that Penn is celebrating McCandless' folly instead of investigating it. Not for one moment are we asked to consider that this kid is perhaps a bit of an idiot. We're meant to find his journey inspiring and his plight tragic. But instead it's neither of those things. And at the end his death is elevated to grandiose status (it's shot like he's ascending to heaven, that he's communing with god). But in reality his death is what happens when a deluded moron tries to live in the wilderness without a map or enough food."
"I read the book in 1996. Like others, it moved me profoundly. I created a series of prints of my interpretation of Chris. I haven't read the book since.This film transported me right back to the spirit that Krakauer brought to life in the book. I spent a few years traveling alone from 1994-1996. This film reminded my why I left and why I returned. Ten years later, all grown up with all the crap, I'm haunted again by Chris. What a well done job.Thank you Sean & John. You did it right.By the way, try to catch Holly Figueroa's song ""Dream in Red"" inspired by Into The Wild."
"One of the best movies I've ever seen. Beautiful, deep, true, adventurous, sad, occasionally funny, real, at times very touching. Based on a real-life novel, it is written and directed by Sean Penn. I have always loved the movie work of Sean Penn. Congratulations and thank you to Mr. Penn on giving me a few hours of though-provoking delight. Can you say Oscar? This movie says it loud and clear! The story; Christopher McCandless, just graduated from college in the early 1990s, goes off on an adventure. He is smitten with books he readsThoreau, London, Byron. He wants no money, so he gives his to needy causes or burns it. Chris is cocky, driven, industrious. He is traumatized by his parents' bad marriage. He tries to work through his anguish. He seems determined to destroy himself just to prove that he has different values than his parents. He is inconsiderate of his family and keeps them worried about his whereabouts and safety, as if a single reassuring phone call would ruin his rebellion. He fancies himself a philosopher, but acts the petulant child. It is a great credit to the film that we see these character flaws in our hero. Off on the road, he makes a number of foolish choices  and suffers from some of them. Other foolish choices, such as daring to kayak a rapid river, bring him joy. He meets a lot of people and almost all are kind to him. His interactions with people are intense, the kind you have when you are planning to run off and disappear while you are still a mysterious entity. He avoids getting too close to anyone.The movie is gorgeous. Mountains, plains, sky, rivers, animals. The acting is fantastic, totally believable. The actors are incredible and perfectly cast  Catherine Keener as an aging hippie vagabond, Vince Vaughn as a wacky farmer growing who knows what, William Hurt as Chris' potbellied suburbanite dad, Marcia Gay Harden as the type of mom who breeds children who wants to run off to the wilderness to escape from her. Emile Hirsch plays Chris, and does a great job of it. When an actual photo of the real Chris McCandless comes on screen, we see that Hirsch resembles him. Original songs by Eddie Vedder give the right feel  that of a well-to-do young white man heading out on a chosen adventure, getting gritty by choice. His goal is to get to Alaska, but on the way there, he hits many other states and Mexico, too.Chris is a clueless kid from the warm South. He plans to go to Alaska, yet only arrives with any needed equipment because kind folks force it upon him  a machete, warm clothes, rubber boots. He's highly educated and gets good grades, yet, early on his trip, ignores a big sign that warns of flash floods. That prepares us that we are going to wince many times at his low level of common sense, while at the same time reveling in his physical strength and willingness to press on. At one point, Chris passes through Los Angeles. He is dirty, hungry, tired, and goes to a downtown mission shelter. The other men there are also dirty, hungry, and tired, but not of their own choosing. It is not their adventure, it is their life. He realizes fast that he does not want to feel categorized with men who are in dire straits due to misfortune and not due to following their own adventure. The movie shows Chris as an honorable young man. I do not want to give away any of the plot, so I'll just say  the young man has principles and so does the movie.A few parts of the movie confused me. After Chris's college graduation, he meets h is parents at a restaurant. He brings with him a lovely young woman, obviously his date. Weirdly, it turns out that she is his sister! There is more confusion when Chris picks up work on a farm run by Wayne, the Vince Vaughn character. What are they growing or doing? What's up? There is an unintentionally funny scene where an old man tells Chris that he does not have time for adventures because he is too busy with leather. I thought the old guy was confessing being into whips and chaps. But no, he has a workshop where he tools leather. There were a couple spots where the editing distracted from the movie. I saw a preview; maybe it was a rough cut. There's a scene on the farm where a triple screen is used  like a cheesy commercial. Another scene, where Chris is eating an apple, is a series of jump cuts, which I really liked. It seemed an homage to French auteur filmmakers. But it ends with Chris mugging at the camera. With it, Sean Penn breaks the believability and acknowledges that yes, this is just us making a movie. There is another part where Chris is in a car with the older man who is dropping him off. As they pull up, there is an inexplicable cutaway shot of what looks to be the head of a cannon. Much of the movie is like a travel montage or music video involving mountains and sky. The scenes are so beautiful. I know people that have elements of Chris in them. And I think I've met all the characters he runs into out on the road."
"Besides the cinematography and music I completely hated Into The Wild. The following is a list that expresses this hatred toward the glorification of Chris Mccandless, a mentally unstable kid who runs away from home. Spoilers. 1. Chris teaches us that when you have problems at home, just run away. 2. Apparently he and his sister are the only kids to ever have to deal with fighting parents. 3. How could he just leave his sister? He obviously loved her and took care of her. But no, he leaves her there with his psycho parents. Never writes her or anything. 4. He was too scared to stand up to his father. He just ran and hid when his dad hit his mother. 5. He turned down a brand new car from his parents to keep a piece of crap. 6. ""I don't need money."" Umm lets see he needed money for a kayak. He worked for Vince Vaughn and Burger King for money so he could make it to Alaska. Just a little hypocritical there. 7. Apparently being a free-spirit makes you an expert kayaker. 8. Everyone he meets is the absolutely nicest person you could ever meet. 9. The male hippie's lines are laughably bad. 10. Male hippie tells Chris that he and female hippie are not doing good. Chris talks to male hippie for about 20 seconds and then goes swimming with female hippie. Male and female hippie go back to being completely in love. 11. The amount of times the word ""Alaska"" is uttered is just annoying. 12. Without the abandoned school bus he would have made it about a week. 13. Living in an abandoned school bus is not exactly living off the land, forgetting society. He slept on a friggin cot, had a place for a fire, and had sufficient shelter. 14. Man. Sitting there by yourself in an abandoned bus in the freezing cold. That's living man. Wow. 15. He thought he could make it in the Alaskan wilderness with no map. 16. His story is basically now a tale of what not to do with your life. 17. The only real thing he learned from his adventure is that ""Happiness is only real when shared."" Umm ya think? There's probably other ridiculous stuff from this movie that I forgot about. This movie makes this kid into some kind of hero when the only thing he accomplished was committing suicide."
"Honestly let me just say this 1st Sean Pean made this story come to life, true life in every moment in the film. This movie has nothing wrong with it, it is perfect in every way shape and form. He did something that brought me to something I never could understand of what either i have to do or what i need to do in my life. If you want a movie from the heart this is it, if you want a movie of love this is it, if you want a movie with real life emotions well this is all of them. Its long but you'll probably want more when you don't want to leave your seat and just live in the moment of they story. So from my heart to yours this movie will speak to you know matter what."
"This is the true story of Christopher McCandless, a college graduate who becomes a bum and eventually bites off more than he can chew by taking on the Alaskan frontier.Early on in the movie, I sort of liked the main character, and the premise behind his motives, but as time goes by, I came to regard him as selfish, silly and maybe a bit insane.He leaves his mother, father and sister distraught for over 2 years, not knowing where he is or if he is even alive. The portrayal of his 'traumatizing' upbringing was laughable (omg, his parents actually argued loudly and threatened to divorce each other a few times!). So what? As these facts came up, you come to dislike Chris (Alexander Supertramp), more and more. It becomes obvious he is just another spoiled suburban kid running from adult responsibilities, refusing to grow up, yet in the end meeting his match by taking on the Alaskan wilderness, which by the way, doesn't give two figs about how well meaning you are in your quest for 'answers'. Nature has no pity for the dumb.Why did they make a movie about this idiot in the first place??"
"I live in Alaska and have for over 20 years and I have hiked, fished and hunted all over this state for most all of it. I lived here when the events of this movie happened. Christopher McCandless was not a hero or anything of the sort and to portray him in this way in this movie and to gloss over the insanely irresponsible actions he took that led to his completely unnecessary death and only invites other misguided ""wilderness advocates"" to do the same.Just as in the case of the Timothy Treadwell, who died along with his girlfriend due to his own lack of respect and understanding for the Alaskan Brown bears he claimed to have a ""relationship"" with, and had a movie made about him (Grizzley Man , 2005) McCandless was just another in a long list of ""outsiders"" who read a few books or even less and feel they have the necessary tools to survive in the bush here.It serves no one to have this movie completely stylize and glamorize the events that are only someone's sanitized version of what happened. In truth McCandless likely died a horrible and lonely death in a completely unnecessary manner and in a completely irresponsible way. If only the movie were stronger to make this point then the it would have served an important role. Instead it only will likely lead to more misguided outsiders, unprepared and irresponsibly doing the same or worse."
"Who Is Chris McCandless? A true supertramp? An obsessive, emotionally damaged egomaniac? Suicidal thrill-seeker? A Kerouac-like drifter addicted to the search for an ever-evasive truth? A high-functioning schizophrenic? The 21st century youth culture reincarnation of John Gault? Or just a kid going through a difficult time and looking for some distance to sort it all out? Sean Penn's pop-philosophical examination of this young man's voyage across America, to Alaska, and to the depths of his young soul will give you an interpretation at least. While it is not clear exactly whose interpretation we are seeing, it is very clear that Penn respects his subject and gave this film about as much thought and power as he could inject it with. And the film did remind me of something very true about the self-righteous naiveté of youth.I am not concerned at all with the accuracy of the film, and, while it is tempting to compare this film to Werner Herzog's excellent but less fictionalized ""Grizzly Man"", the subjects are really too widely disparate; Herzog and Penn's perspective on humanity is too different to produce a meaningful comparison. The targets of this comparison, too big and too easy. But I will make one comment about the two films - Penn's film is much more or a tribute to its protagonist than Herzog's.I found Into the Wild to be a gripping, thoughtful film. The script was good, but sometimes a bit pretentious - occasionally crossing the line between character development and character worship. Penn's direction and cinematography are masterful. The acting - every member of the cast included - is absolutely excellent.Recommended - but not for light cheerful entertainment."
"This really stupid glorification tribute film financed by the extremely wealthy McCandless whose son died a futile death from poisoning , starvation and overexposure in the Alaskan wilderness. Having graduated from Emory University the super spoiled typical rich kid rebels against what is expected of him by his parents. Like most of his type knowing full well he can always fall back on his parents wealth when it suits them to do so he then sets out on squandering his allowance after reportedly having donating his allowance to charity. The character playing his sister provides a narrative throughout the film providing a rational that his parents premarital experiences as well as their highly strained marriage as the reason for his escape into irresponsible living.This mainly fantasized account of Chris McCandless's last stage of life includes all these encounters that paint him as a much loved eccentric character idolized by young women, a grain farmer, welfare workers, burnt out hippies and an old man who wants to adopt him. He breaks ecological laws by rafting down the Colorado river without a permit to Mexico where he sweet talks his way back into the USA without ID papers. McCandless then finishes his little road trip adventure with a hunting trip to the Alaskan wilderness. Despite being fully equipped and armed the idiot McCandless manages to die of a combination of starvation, poisoning and over exposure. Sean Penn directs this silly film which will no doubt find fans amongst superficial young women and other well to do hippie types. I suspect these types of films inspire young people to take foolish paths in life that only the rich can afford to take and have seen this happen to friends of mine with similar disastrous consequences. I'm giving it one star because maybe it will inspire other idiots to perish in the wilderness. I was not keen on the wasteful shooting of Alaskan wildlife for McCandless's camping experiment. Great comedy material."
"Stunning scenery, brilliant directing from Sean Penn, soulful songs from Eddie Vedder, and a remarkable, true story. Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) is a college graduate from an affluent upbringing who decides to abandon his possessions and money and to live life out on the road, ala Jack London or Jack Kerouac during parts of their lives. He's a fascinating character because of his idealism and his nonconformity; he's intelligent and kind, and yet he doesn't value human relationships, preferring solitude and a deep connection to nature. Hirsch plays the part very well, displaying an easy, personable warmth but at the same time a determination to go his own way, damn the consequences. He also really looks the part, including scenes where he had to lose quite a bit of weight. His character is troubled from an upbringing that was riddled with strife, and in one moments says so simply (and sadly) ""Some people feel like they don't deserve love. They walk away quietly into empty spaces, trying to close the gaps of the past,"" and yet we get the feeling that is just one aspect of a complicated and yet simple guy.I think some people are turned off by what they feel was a glorification, but I didn't feel that way at all. We see the trail of tears he leaves behind him, with his parents and sister devastated by not hearing from him, and him ignoring some of the kindly advice he receives along the way. He is also brutal to an old man (Hal Holbrook) who so very generously offers to adopt him, in what is a fantastic scene. Holbrook is also brilliant when he tells the young man ""when you forgive, you love."" We see him take risks which pay off (kayaking down a rampaging river), and of course others which do not (going into the true wild of Alaska without a map or enough preparation). For that he is sometimes vilified or mocked, but I admired him for not conforming like the rest of us, and for living life on his own terms. He certainly was not cheated. And in the end, he has his moment of realization, that ""happiness (is) only real when shared"", which is a moment that is incredibly poignant.I loved the literary references in the film, starting with the title card quoting Byron, which seems so perfect: ""There is a pleasure in the pathless woods; / There is a rapture on the lonely shore; / There is society, where none intrudes, / By the deep sea, and music in its roar; / I love not man the less, but Nature more...""And at the end as I thought about McCandless's life, I thought that this passage from Thoreau was nowhere more suitable: ""Why should we be in such desperate haste to succeed, and in such desperate enterprises? If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away."""
"Sean Penn's ""Into The Wild"" is perhaps best viewed as being part of a recent wave of eco-themed films (""Wall-E"", ""Avatar"", ""The Happening"", ""An Inconvenient Truth"", ""Grizzly Man"", ""Dreamland"", ""Day The Earth Stood Still"", ""Antichrist"", ""Day After Tomorrow"", ""Happy Feet"" etc). Most of these films urge their audiences to ""return to nature"", ""retreat to some pastoral existence"" or ""save the planet"" (without looking at the systemic or economic forces which completely undermine or neutralise such wants).Interestingly, aside from ""Antichrist"", ""Grizzly Man"" and ""Into The Wild"", nature in these films is always portrayed as being some kind of mystical, ""balanced"" system. While mega-studios, quite ironically, advise us to harmonize with nature, ""smaller"" directors (Penn, Herzog, Von Trier) seem to instead posit worlds in which nature is vile and base. Nature is still portrayed as being majestic and splendid, but is then associated with asphyxiation and choking, death and rot. The only harmony – as Werner Herzog once famously said – is that of overwhelming and collective murder. Murder, then, is the central theme of both ""Grizzly Man"" and ""Into The Wild"". Like Sydney Pollack's ""Jerremiah Johnson"", both films are about young men (Christopher McCandless in Penn's film, Timothy Treadwell in Herzog's) who cut themselves off from civilisation and venture off into the wilderness. Of course both Herzog and Penn initially romanticise their central characters' flights. They see beauty in this journey and a kind of crazy inner strength (McCandless rejects vapid materialism, 9 to 5 routines and sees the modern word as being a hindrance which atrophies humanity and conscience ). But both artists are also careful to counter this idealism with nature at its most violent. And so both films find their heroes ""leaving civilisation"", but only because they've first suffered a total, psychological collapse. They now disbelieve in their Master Signifiers, in their Symbolic Orders, and see civilisation itself as being representative of that which is arbitrary and chaotic. Both films then end with the deaths of their central characters, McCandless killed by a lowly poisonous berry, Treadwell killed by a mighty grizzly bear. This is not romanticism: the impetus for our adventures is something sad and pathetic, even if they're absolutely right. Their problem is that they've diagnosed civilisation but idealised Nature, a fatal failing; mankind's history is a history of battling the wild outdoors. Respect Nature. Approach with caution.And so both Treadwell and McCandless are portrayed as being disenchanted idealists who cut themselves off from a world they no longer feel apart of, no longer trust, no longer believe in. But while Penn romanticises Christopher's idealistic dream of ""entering the wilderness"", he is careful to counter this with nature at its most violent. Christopher hunts for food but recoils from maggots, Christopher attempts to cross a river, but nature's violent highways prove too powerful, Christopher forages for berries, but eats only poisonous weeds which ultimately kill him.The result is that Penn celebrates disenchantment and urges one to disconnect (mental breakdown, oft the precursor to wisdom), even as he warns that drifting too far is itself a form of suicide or self-destruction. Chris wants to cut himself off from mankind (the film opens with a quote from the Romantic Movement which advocates ""ostracizing oneself from humanity""), but also learns that ""Happiness Is Real Only When Shared"" (the last dreams he has is of hugging his parents). And that's Penn's irony: it is the connections that Christopher makes with other people as he continues along on his journey which allowed him to survive in the wilderness for as long as he did. When towards the end of the film Christopher turns down an offer to live with an elderly man, he effectively gave up entirely on humanity. This total disconnection, this suicidal action, is ultimately what the film warns of.The kind of balance that the film longs for is thus similar to the teachings of Thoreau, who advocated finding a middle ground between rejecting and fully embracing the wilderness. The people Chris meets (and rejects) along his journey are thus in possession of the life he longs for.Elsewhere the film is about the enchantment of text and the romance of words. Krakauer wrote about Chris not only because Chris' journey was inspired by idealistic books (Chris takes literature rather than food with him) but because Chris was himself a writer and left behind numerous documents. What the film thus does is sets up a war between the word (fantasy) and the image (world). As each level of text is one step removed from reality, image eventually wins, the image of a berry and the failure to correctly read it being what ultimately kills Chris.Audiences typically view Chris as either a ""hero"" or a ""jerk"", but he's more a lost, fragile child. Having learnt that everything he knew about his parents and his own history was a lie, Chris began to distrust everything. Suddenly all truths were shattered. The only way for Christopher's mind to cope with this subjective destitution was to then enter a little fantasy world in which he's a ""noble adventurer"". As he loves meta-acting, Penn thus has actor Emile Hirsch play Christopher as a wounded guy playing the role of the very romantic hero he reads about in books.Elsewhere, like Kirk Douglas' ""Lonely Are The Brave"", Penn contrast modern technology with primitivism. He stresses the artificiality of the caravans and abandoned buses which Christopher relies on to survive, and counterpoints Christopher's physical death with a near spiritual shot of a modern passenger jet. The film does not condemn modern technology, it recognises it as a necessity. The film then ends with Christopher's body seemingly ""transcending"" into heaven. The film then rewinds, his body sucked into the ground, Penn's camera pulling back such that Christopher's corpse seems to be asphyxiated by Nature. 8.5/10 – Worth two viewings."
"What is wrong with you people? This is a Walt Disneyesque revision of a spoiled kid's misadventure into self-indulgence. It's a shame he died for being righteous and stupid...and that's about it. It's a shame. But not a particularly interesting story, and a ridiculous one for a film filled with swirling helicopter shots and endless musical montages that are supposed to make you think the smirking Mccandless is some kind of modern Siddhartha.Sean Penn clearly identifies with his subject enough to direct his film with a similar self-indulgence. This should have been a very straight-forward account of one young idealist's cowardice: too afraid to help the society he thought was sick, too afraid too deal with his family with compassion, and ultimately too afraid to kill himself outright: instead he just put himself into a situation that he couldn't survive without rescue...and nobody rescued him.I wonder about the people who rave about this movie. I'll bet I could make the same kind of film about John Walker Lindh, and they'd eat it up...provided I could get Vedder for the soundtrack."
"As a parent who's reasonably liberal and open-minded I was nevertheless repulsed by the incredibly self-serving main character and director Sean Penn's unsubtle and cloying anti-government/anti-commercialist bent. McCandless may have been a straight-a student but he didn't learn a bloody thing in college. The writings of Byron, London, Tolstoy, Thoreau i.e. are taught as a jumping off point toward self-determination and adulthood. They are not meant to be literally emulated as lifestyles.And the ridiculous conceit of a 24 year old lecturing an elderly man to open up and go live his life underscores the primary issue with this movie, a misanthropic and deluded main character. Acting was decent enough but I could not for a moment get into the story or the performance due to my disconnect. In scene after scene, I was constantly reminded of the agony McCandless put his poor parents and sister through. Sure they made some mistakes in bringing him up but who's perfect in this world? It would have cost him nothing to simply let them know he was still alive and on 'walk-about' or whatever he thought his pointless odyssey signified. Or at least given them the chance to say good-bye.Ultimately, I found ""Into the Wild"" irresponsible because McCandless is presented as the rebellious anti-hero rather than a fool who caused his own senseless death and the deepest sorrow of his loved ones. Sean Penn is a talented somehow but choosing the right sorts of role models to present on film is not one of his skills. Oh and I will definitely not be sending my kids to Emory College if this is the sort of minds they produce..."
"I watched this movie on the aeroplane after searching through the movie list and not finding anything else interesting to watch. I didn't even know what the film was called until the ending credits. However, what I saw was amazing - the acting and scenery was excellent and the plot was thought provoking. More people should watch this to appreciate the message to us all. I was also surprised to see it was was actually a true story which made it even more interesting (I love films that are based on true stories). It is one of the best movies i've seen that portrays the contrast between a materialistic world vs the natural world that is at the core of the universe. This is a film that can easily be overlooked but not forgotten."
"Please spare yourself and avoid this film, it is utterly boring and undeserving of a high rating. This should not be in the top 250. Although the cinematography was of high quality, it does not make up for the two and a half hours of pretentious tedium I had to sit through. The main character is portrayed as a sophisticated critic of modern life, but in reality is just self involved and is seemingly oblivious to the pain and suffering he pointlessly inflicts on the people closest too him. At around the 40 minute mark we all considered (4 of us) ejecting the DVD, and I regret we didn't. Usually I do not bother to comment on films, but in this case I feel it is my duty to save others the pain."
"A 3 hour Pearl Jam Video chronicling a spoiled kid's quest to get back at his parents for an unpleasant childhood.I just felt like it was so totally pretentious. It seemed like I was being preached to by someone who's most notable achievement in life was running away from home and freeloading off of hippies.Add a generous portion of man crying, soap box philosophy, and slow-mo shower scenes, all built on this rickety premise that somehow this quest for revenge was a philosophical journey, and I was hardly able to sit through this one.Pardon me if I'm venting, but I didn't want to say anything bad about it to my girlfriend because I never like the movies she makes me see, and she's typically very nice about the movies I make her watch. After all the positive reviews I just had to say my mind.If he hadn't died at the end, and if it had turned out that he'd spent the rest of his life writing books about his experiences than this would be one of the most hypocritical and pretentious movies of all time.In stead, it is the story of those who've survived him desperately trying to weave meaning into what could only be described as the trite and meaningless life of Christopher McCandless"
"This film is a 1...at best. I will never, not ever, get the time back that I wasted watching this dreadful film. I am completely perplexed as to how this movie scored an 8?! I can only assume that no one else saw the film that I saw. Coming from Sean Penn, I should have known it would be filled with left-wing, anti-government bulls#!t. To be frank, the film is nothing more than the bastard love-child of Dead Poets Society and Grizzly Adams...except suckier. Christoper McCandless was not only a misguided, self-absorbed, self-indulgent youth, he IS the ultimate idiot. There isn't a single quality to admire about him, with the exception of his generous donation to charity. An action, I would suspect this misanthrope made with the sole purpose of pi$$ing his parents off. Simply put, this film is the ""whoa as me"" tale of a rich, spoiled, young man who was TOO determined to prove that the apple sometimes does fall far from the tree. He is completely undeserving of the accolades or screen time he managed to eek out of Hollywood. His ""quest"" for the ultimate human experience cost him his life...and to gain what? I mean, seriously, what it the point of this movie?? It really only leaves questions, for which there are no answers. Most notably, how can anyone...especially someone as educated as he was...thrust himself into the Alaskan wilderness (one of the most remote places on the planet) without doing a little research?? Congratulations Emory, you taught the boy well!! Seriously, all of you who gave this movie higher than a 3, would you really put yourself in the position that he put himself? Would you not have spent some time in Alaska, maybe worked a job to acclimate yourself to the land? Would you not have gotten a little advice, perhaps taken a guided tour and survival courses? Would you not have learned about weather patterns and considered that after crossing a river before the summer thaw meant that you wouldn't be able to cross it when the snow began to melt?? No, this yahoo simply asks someone to drive him to the end of the road and drop him off on a trail. Smart buddy! The countdown on your life just began. In truth, Chris McCandless committed suicide and Hollywood pathetically glorified it. Yeah, yeah, I realize he had ""books"" to help him out. Yet, we find out in the end what good they did him. I guess Tolstoy doesn't offer much in the way of how to preserve a moose. Any rational person would have realized they were in trouble months before this guy. ""Hmm...I keep taking notches up on my belt. I am eating every day...nothing but lean protein..but still, I am eating. Yet, I have managed to lose 60 pounds. Gosh, I wonder if something is wrong??"" The only redeeming quality of this film is that it does manage to remind us that Mother Nature will always be there to strike you down when you begin to get a little too righteous for her taste. Or, in this case, she will leave you to die, alone, in the shell of an old school bus, surrounded by the philosophical b.s. that put you there in the first place, wasted away in a pool of your own feces."
"Sean Penn's 'Into the Wild' is a passionate and faithful evocation of Jon Krakauer's book about Chris McCandless. It's the troubling and complex story of a young idealist and seeker who was also a rebellious child and beloved brother who gave away his $24,000 savings to Oxfam after college, went off in an old Datsun and left his family behind, and disappeared for two years wandering the country, only to be found by hunters dead of poisoning and starvation in an abandoned bus in the wilds of Alaska.It's been said as a criticism of Penn's movie that it isn't as neutral about McCandless as Krakauers's book. It is true that Emile Hirsch as Chris, who called himself Alexander Supertramp on the road, is such a joyous and appealing character it's hard to focus on the arbitrariness and foolhardiness of the young man. Hirsch gives his all. He has shown his knack for playing bad good boysparticularly in 'Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys' and 'Lords of Dogtown'and for playing wild misfitsin the little seen 'The Mudge Boy.' This is the first great role he's had, and he deserves it. His work is a wonderful melding of ""negative capability"" and generosity. It comes naturally to him to embody exuberance, boldness, and joy. If there was something off-putting or stern in the real-life McCandless, it's not very noticeable in Hirsch. But Hirsch's enthusiasm makes sense of the great adventure and self-discovery this story recounts. (Sadly, McCandless never seemed more ready to embrace life, and to overcome all his doubts about people and family, than right near his end.) All the faults McCandless had and mistakes he made made are there in the story as Penn tells it; if he has altered facts (and necessarily left some out), he hasn't done so to make the young man's plans seem clearer or his choices wiser, and the movie is replete with specific detail.'Into the Wild,' true, is itself a little on the wild and loud side, with its occasionally obtrusive Eddie Vedder soundtrack, it's insanely vivid characterslike the young Danish couple on the banks of the Colorado, Vince Vaughan's intense, grinning grain farmer, Hal Holbrook's fabulously sad, shut-down old widower. There is another kind of overload in the occasional use of split screens. But it all unfolds very much as Jon Krakauer's book does, with interludes at the ""magic bus"" where Chris met his doom constantly intercut with episodes from his travels earlier during his two wander-years. And incredible episodes they are: roaming with a warm hippie couple; illegally and hair-raisingly running the Colorado rapids in a kayak; working in the big grain elevator and loving it; riding the rails and loving that too, till he's caught and beaten; escaping a flophouse in L.A.; staying with old Mr. Franz (Holbrook), learning from him how to engrave leather belts and persuading him to climb a mountain; and then off into the hostile snow country with a big back pack and sheer will. Many voiceovers from Chris's sister add more about the sibling relationship than was in the book; the family ""fearlessly"" cooperated in the film-making. McCandless's stern NASA honcho dad (William Hurt) and uptight mother (Marcia Gay Harden) are as unappealing as he saw them, but are not overdrawnor underrepresented. Among other things Sean Penn's film is a remarkable balancing act.It's obvious this story had to be made into a movie, and it's hard to imagine how anyone could have done it better than Penn and his fine cast. All Penn's directorial efforts have been heartfelt and earnest, but this of his films thus far is his greatest artistic success and has the widest appeal. Into the Wild is a good balance of the emotionally wrenching and the thought-provoking. It contains so many themes and poses so many questionsabout youth, about time, about responsibility. Chris isn't to be confused with Herzog's 'Grizzly Man'. He's aware of the danger of nature. It's just that he has the hubris of daring to approach it with too little knowledge and experience, knowing the risk, and taking it. And indeed he might have made it and gotten back out, but for two or three terrible mistakes. Nature is unforgiving.Chris McCandless was unforgiving too. But if he read the romantic Bible of his own life lived in those intense two years and lived to tell of them, the film suggests, he would have learned to love and forgive. He was bright, talented, passionate about life, a seeker or rare moral fervor who read and thought and recorded all that happened in those last days. His death was sadly premature. But there are signsthey're clear in Krakauer's bookthat he made an impact on the world he inhabited and the people he met. Vince Vaughan's character shouts, ""You're one hell of a young man. You're one hell of a young man!"" He died terribly alone. But maybe the tree that falls in the forest is heard after all. ""Quant'e' bella giovanezza,"" goes an Italian renaissance verse, ""Che si fugge tuttavia."" How beautiful is youth, which flees straightaway. McCandless' story embodies those lines.'Into the Wild' seems more moving and thought-provoking than any other recent film, and may be destined to become some kind of classican 'Easy Rider', some have said, for our times. It's about society and nature, about family, about idealism and aloneness; most of all it's about the dangerous, heartbreakingly brief and beautiful romanticism of youth. In those two years, Chris McCandless lived a whole, remarkable, life. And Sean Penn has captured those two years for us."
"I cannot understand the praise for this stinker. If I was a Republican, I'd tell my kids and my teenage gay lover (they all have one) that this will happen to you if you're a hippie.Don't get me wrong. I'm a tree hugger. A lot of positive and good ideas and concepts in this film. But it's obvious that this guy was bat-poop nuts. The character was played as sane, but there is no chance he was in real life. Nevermind that he was critically selfish for what he did to his family and sister, regardless of the situation. If he wanted to contribute, there were a lot more sane ways to do it.It really took the life out of any anti-society argument.But to focus on the film I was shocked that Sean Penn couldn't do a better job with this kid's acting. Generally it was passable but then there were some very bad scenes, like he was reading off cue cards for the first time. Some nice camera work but nothing really remarkable about the rest of the direction. And it was WAY TOO LONG. Very self-serving of Senor Penn.(Also, anybody know that there was a rope bridge 1/4 mile down from this bus? Most locals apparently thought this kid was a fool.) For all the kids that would like to go on a similar journey of self-discovery: DON'T! There is something worse than a winter in that bus: watching this movie."
"Judging from some of the comments I've read, this has to be one of the most overrated and misguided films of all time. Had there been an option for 0 out of 10, I would have voted thus for sure.I don't really know where to start... I haven't read the book, but I'm certain that, if I had, I would never have inflicted the ordeal of watching this on myself.This is the story of a spoilt, rich kid, who self-indulgently flees his family problems - and those of the society he so resents - instead of facing up to any kind of responsibility or even attempting to rectify the injustices he so pertinently feels.What really grates with me is that this is a wasted opportunity. Christopher McCandless is the product of a society, which places too much value on the individual - hence his ultimately selfish decision to take flight to his over-romanticised 'wilderness' (an abandoned bus!!!)- rather than use his all-too-lauded intelligence to better it.What a character for hero-worship!! The way in which he is - and I don't use the term lightly - deified by Sean Penn ranges from the unpalatable to the damn near puke-making.There are a couple of moments in this film, which epitomise this errant viewpoint. Namely when two of it's more likable characters - the hippy wife and the old gimmer veteran - point out that Christopher should consider contacting his family. But - surprise, surprise - both are won over by his 'free spirit'...No, no, no, no, no. If the flaky Sean Penn, much like his subject, had had the balls, this would have been the point to turn back, but, predictably, we fall deeper into the mire of tedious, self-indulgent and, quite frankly, out-of-touch morality.'Into the wild' should serve, not only as a shining beacon of how not to live your life, but also as a guide for how not to make a film.I would encourage people to watch this film, but only so they can see what a god-awful travesty it is. Christopher McCandless wasted his life - and a good couple of hours of mine too, but if any good is to come of it, we need to make sure that he and others like him (I'm looking at you Sean Penn) are given a good slap in the chops and told to grow up.Peace out!!!!!!!!!"
"This is a really good movie, unfortunately I could not remove myself from the fact that the main character was a complete moron. First of all contrary to what people feel, ""dropping out of society"" is a lazy, b.s. way of rebelling against corporate society, and never achieves anything but a self fulfilled prophecy. Here is what native Alaskans felt about this fool in general. ""Krakauer's book made McCandless a heroic figure to many.Unlike Krakauer and many readers of his book, who have a largely sympathetic view of McCandless, some Alaskans have negative views of both McCandless and those who romanticize his fate. McCandless was unaware that a hand-operated tram crossed the river a quarter mile from the Stampede Trail, while a nearby shelter was stocked with emergency supplies, as described in Krakauer's book. However, the three nearby cabins were broken in and vandalized extensively at some point after mid-April, thus destroying food and first-aid supplies, as noted by Jon Krakauer. Alaskan Park Ranger Peter Christian wrote: ""I am exposed continually to what I will call the 'McCandless Phenomenon.' People, nearly always young men, come to Alaska to challenge themselves against an unforgiving wilderness landscape where convenience of access and possibility of rescue are practically nonexistent ... When you consider McCandless from my perspective, you quickly see that what he did wasn't even particularly daring, just stupid, tragic, and inconsiderate. First off, he spent very little time learning how to actually live in the wild. He arrived at the Stampede Trail without even a map of the area. If he had a good map he could have walked out of his predicament ... Essentially, Chris McCandless committed suicide."" Judith Kleinfeld wrote in the Anchorage Daily News that ""many Alaskans react with rage to his stupidity. You'd have to be a complete idiot, they say, to die of starvation in summer 20 miles off the Park's Highway.""[12] Thank you very much, but making a martyr out of a moron is just too much."
"Sean Penn's artistic contribution to cinema in my lifetime has been staggering. The films he's directed have included some of my favourite performances from amazing actors pushed to their absolute limit.I feel like everything he's ever done in his career so far, every tiny nuance, has been distilled into this incredible film. From start to finish it is beyond inspiring - by the end, it lifts right off the ground.The first time the soundtrack really kicked in, I felt that Eddie Vedder's score seemed too loud. Then I realized that my only complaint was merely me resisting the full experience. The whole point of it all was to let go and not be afraid of going that one step too far."
"I agree with many others who have said that the main character makes some bad decisions (And you haven't?), and I agree that the film's story is far from the greatest story that has ever been made into a film. However, the story here is an important one that has a lot to say about being human. The story itself is certainly not at all an easy one to tell through the cinematic medium. Nonetheless, I really do think Sean Penn has captured this story nearly as well as it possibly could have been told on film, and that in itself is a stunning accomplishment. This story is so real, so human, that it reaches out and has obviously grabbed a ton of peoples hearts, including mine. The scenes themselves give off a very authentic feeling, even where some parts are somewhat rushed through for the betterment of the whole story, it ends up working well in full scope. Many of the scenes are extremely intimate, including the scene where Hirsch looks directly into the camera to increase this very aspect I feel. I know a lot of people have criticized this part, and I agree in most films it would have no place whatsoever, but here it is a very daring and effective decision by Penn in my opinion. Much of the film displays a vast amount of scenic beauty, and the scenes at slab city are nothing short of 'classic'.To me, the important thing to take from the film is not why Chris decided to leave his parents and society. Nor do I think anyone can in their right mind criticize this decision he made. That is pointless. The fact is that it was his choice, whatever his accumulative reasons may have been is beside the point. The value here is in what he learns from the experience, and the incredible way in which he and Sean Penn have now shared that message with the rest of the world.Eddie Vedders music was obviously the perfect choice for this film, as it sways with emotional depth and helps to carry the films authentic feel. There are many great acting performances here as well, none better than Catherine Keener's brilliant delivery of grace and genuine heart.The story here ventures into the territory that drives all human experience. The search for authentic heart that all people, knowingly or not search for.The heart searches for heart, only to find itself treading in a sea of broken hearts, all cut from the same Divine Cloth. The One, and the many...forever lost within ourselves.""Happiness only real when shared"" Chris McCandless9.5/10"
"I squirmed almost from the pretentious opening credits. The soppy music, the self-conscious titles, the interminable wait for the film to actually begin ...The first sight of the lead: a handsome, golden boy from Hollywood. An actor, ""indicating"" like crazy instead of just doing.And what followed was a tedious, two-hour and twenty-minute music video.If a superb book had not been the ""inspiration"" for this dud, it never would have made it past its first studio reader. Jon Krakauer's gritty story of a confused idealist was turned into clichéd, sentimental mush about a Johnny Appleseed who enriched the lives of all the stereotyped characters he encountered.It was the typical, corrupt Hollywood treatment, but without Hollywood production quality. Most of the beautiful scenery was perfunctorily photographed, and the pacing was atrociously slow.I kept hoping it would improve, but it actually got worse and worse, right up to drawn-out, hackneyed ending and self-congratulatory final credits.Chris McCandless and Jon Krakauer deserved better."
"I just saw this in Chicago at an advanced viewing, I did not read the book but I do remember seeing the event on the news.The movie was epic- over 2.3 hours long, but there was never a dull moment. There were some risqué shots that I enjoyed, in particular one where Chris looks into the lens (which I think worked really well.) This film showed how beautiful this country is and how one person can be so in touch with that (makes you think about embracing life). Emile did a great job as Chris, dealing with a forked up home life is something almost everyone can relate to on one level or another. I think this movie will serve as an eye opener for a lot of people.William Hurt was great, Catherine Keener was excellent, as was everyone else and the locals were very enjoyable to watch.The music contributed by Vedder was awesome as well! I definitely cried about... 4 times. The ending was so dramatic (because it was real and had to handle the final moments of a young man that we came to like). It seemed like the movie could have ended in several places, but overall I'm glad it decided to hit the 2.3 hour mark....Afterward Emile did a Q+A where he pretty much talked about his experience being in Alaska, meeting Chris's family, acting with Sean Penn, made a joke about speed racer, etc. It sounded like a great time and it was clear that he was really enthusiastic about the project and proud of it."
"Films have to be viewed in their own light as it's own single art piece, as the filmmakers intended to deliver their narrative through sound, picture and editing to us. Forget all knowledge that this film was 'based on a novel' that was 'based on a true story'.Saying that, this film is hypocritical from start to finish with a touch of left wing anti- establishment thrown in for good measure and some very lazy film-making indeed.Society is awful. Join a charity and help out. My dad was a meanie. Stand up to him when he is beating up your mum, not when he is offering to buy you a new car.I do not understand how this film is regarded so highly that it appeared on many top 10 critic list for 2007. This is why I am writing my 2 cents worth.Technically this film is sloppy. It uses every filmic cliché device possible to spoon feed it's audience and not allow them to make their own decisions of what is happening on screen.Main protagonist starts acting dizzy as if he has ate something bad. Not sure if you were right? Sean Penn the Director cuts to the word 'Poison' then to the bag of weeds, then to a full screen text of 'Death' back to the bag of weeds and then if you weren't sure what was happening we get a blurred, stretched out effect laden close up of the protagonist getting sick.Too many problems with this film; the length (2hr 20min), the anti-establishment themes (we get it), Not sleeping with sexy trailer park girl (?).Society is awful and evil, so what he denounces it. Then why hitch-hike with people who own cars, steal rides on trains and eat food from people who live in houses. Nice ideals.Finally, standing in the soup kitchen line he realizes that society is so disgusting that he does not want to be in a room full of homeless people as it hits him that he actually has parents to fall back on when his self-righteousness does not work out.Up there with 'Life is beautiful' as a truly overrated film."
"How can you describe a film like Into the Wild? One of the greats & by far my favourite film of all time. The only film I have ever seen which manages to capture the true spirit of adventure. The beauty of Into the Wild for me is that what Christopher McCandless is running from is never as important as what he is running to. Sean Penn has directed this film with magnificent precision and imaginative grace. Every scene, every image used in this film tells it's own story and the countless people Chris meets along the way are as magical and integral to his journey as his survival in the wilderness. I love the beautiful simplicity of this film and how it has captured nature in both it's breathtaking and dangerous forms so perfectly.Emile Hirsch is a sensational actor and helps make Into the Wild what it is. His acting is totally believable, and the story often trips along with him silently acting, using nothing but his body and facial expressions to put across emotions and thoughts. A perfect cast alongside Emile, including the likes of Jena Malone, Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn, Kristen Stewart and Hal Holbrook, all help make Into the Wild an enjoyable watch.Into the Wild has a very special quality to it, something which I can't quite put my finger on. It is a culmination of things, from the beautiful imagery, the fantastic script, the amazing cast, the often mesmerising quotations and of course the feeling of adventure and of true freedom. It is a unique vision into the life of a young man searching for himself in a dangerous environment who comes to realise that the true meaning of happiness may not be what he first thought. I highly recommend this film. It is one that will stay with your for a long long time."
"When Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch) graduated from college, he had one goal in life - to finally break away from his unhappy family and the constraints of society in general and live off the land in Alaska. The episodic film flashes back and forth between Chris' adventures in Alaska and the months leading up to it, focusing on the people who befriended him, including an aging hippie couple and a lonely, old man (well-played by the venerable Hal Holbrook).Based on a true story and narrated with many of Chris' journal entries, the film is an emotional roller coaster; I was torn between admiring his youthful idealism and courage and hating him for the pain he inflicted on his family. The movie feels much like a documentary as it follows Chris hitchhiking and working his way across the country and then surviving, at first, quite well in Alaska.Emile Hirsch is well-cast as Chris and makes you care about him right from the start. He did all of his demanding stunts himself and even lost 40 pounds to play the ailing Chris. It is a very touching story. Amid the splendor of the wilderness but ultimately alone, Chris finally understood that happiness is only real when it is shared. Highly recommended."
"Sean Penn's sometimes engrossing and often beautiful film Into The Wild is, in the end analysis, about a character who was basically selfish and self-centered. Like Jim Morrison in Oliver Stone's The Doors, whom I found to be a self-centered ass, eventually I felt I was on a journey that had little or no revelation, with a person who was primarily selfish, and which leads to (spoiler follows) starvation in the Alaskan wilderness, an ending in which the only meaning I could find was that if you are going to camp next to a river and live off the land, bring a damn fishing pole.This is not to say the film does not have its strengths. The cinematography makes the most of the beautiful landscapes through which Alexander Supertramp, in an earlier incarnation Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch) passes. Also of note are some very strong performances by Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn and Hal Holbrook as people that Alexander meets and bonds with during his journey. The same cannot be said of the lead, however.Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch) is a bright, upper middle class young man who has just graduated college. His parents are ready to gift him with a new car and hope he will apply to Harvard Law. He has other plans - to break the bonds of ordinary American existence and walk the Earth, rootless and without clear destination, in search of ... enlightenment? Escape? Even Chris doesn't seem to know.The film is narrated by Chris' sister, Carine (played by Jena Malone), and we get some back-story. Chris was a born wanderer - at 4, he wandered away from home at 3 AM and was found 6 blocks away raiding a neighbor's cookie jar. His family life was unhappy - his parents had the kind of marriage that should have led to divorce, but didn't. And he feels a deep, internal rejection of modern life. He burns all his IDs, gives away his money, and drives off into the American southwest in his beat up Datsun. Sleeping in it one night he is caught in a flash flood, and abandons the car, setting off on foot, Burning Man style, with just the shoes on his feet and a backpack, on a voyage of discovery, and taking a new name - Alexander Supertramp.These are all things that I could sympathize with. Many young people coming out of college seek something different from the lives their parents led. Alexander is simply taking the vision quest to a greater extreme. Without letting his family know where he is, he just disappears. In two years he will climb the highest peak of his journey, tramping off into the Alaskan wilderness alone, into the wild, to get away from civilization altogether.The initial periods of his journey are the film's strength. Intermittently flashing forward and back from Alaska, the film follows Alex as he meets a couple of hippies with an RV, kayaks down the Colorado river into Mexico, then finds his way to South Dakota where he drives a combine, and so on. On his journey he bonds with a number of unusual individuals, and decides that the place he wants to be is Alaska, away from civilization completely.However, the film begins to drag. It runs long (two and a half hours) and feels longer. There are really no revelations on his journey, just a series of beautiful landscapes and sometimes kooky characters that float in and out of his life. By the time he meets old coot Ron Franz (a superb Hal Holbrook) I was ready for this movie to hurry up and get to the resolution of his Alaskan adventure. When it is finally reached, I found it rather pointless - although he is equipped for the Wild, has a rifle for hunting, and has found a great camping site (an abandoned bus with a mattress as shelter), his supplies begin to run out and game becomes scarce. Forced to forage for edible plants and berries, he mistakes a poisonous plant for something edible. He is cut off from escape by a flooded river (and has, as I mentioned, NO FISHING POLE) and eventually weakens and succumbs to starvation. He could have at least tried spear-fishing - he had a knife and some waterproof boots.The film also focuses, perhaps inadvertently, on something Alex did that I found to be unforgivable - the torture of his parents. They see him one last time after graduation at a McCormick & Schmick's in Atlanta before he disappears, and spend the ensuing two years in a state of agony over where their son is. Although I appreciated Alex' desire to find meaning in his life, not providing any word as to his well-being with his parents or his sister is just unforgivable. That may be a personal judgment about the character that not all people who watch this film will share, but that was my reaction.Another flaw in this film is the casting of Emile Hirsch as the lead. He is appealingly good looking, but there is an inner fire missing there as an actor. Hirsch' Alexander is empty for me. I followed him across some amazing landscapes and through many interesting meetings without ever discovering why someone felt they needed to make a movie out of a young man who became a tramp after college and then starved to death in Alaska. Hal Holbrook is able to convey more depth and emotion in his brief time on screen than Hirsch does while on screen for almost three hours.There are many sections of Into The Wild that I thoroughly enjoyed, and for a brief period during the first half of the film I was thoroughly engrossed. But that eventually passed, and I continued waiting for a revelation that never came. All in all, nice try, no cigar."
"Sean Penn's Into the Wild is beautiful, staggering, thoughtful, a labor of love made by a filmmaker with real passion for the story he set out to tell. Like a Terrence Malick picture, Into the Wild transcends any conception such as ""if you only see one film this year"" and goes beyond the very notion of ""Oscar-worthy"". If one really has to say something on the subject, then Into the Wild should have shared the Best Picture award with No Country for Old Men, but that kind of thinking is besides the point because Penn's masterpiece is more than a movie, or a work of art for that matter: it's a life experience.A rebel at heart, Penn clearly identifies, at least on a few levels, with the film's unconventional protagonist, a bright young boy named Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch), whose astounding true story was first recounted in Jon Krakauer's book which gives the picture its title. Christopher had it all: loving parents (William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden) and sister (Jena Malone), excellent grades and a most promising future. Then, one fine day the 20-year old college graduate decided that wasn't really what he wanted, took his law school fund and disappeared, setting out for a journey to the heart of America. ""I'm going into the wild"" the self-renamed Alex Supertramp wrote in his journal, and though he occasionally ran into people (Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn and others) he would connect with in a deeper way, that's where he really belonged: away from civilization, just him, his elementary tools and the pure, untarnished nature surrounding him.Christopher's journey, which is carried out with just the basic resources one needs to survive (no cell phone or other gadgets), is a modern odyssey of sorts, a quest for something that was lost forever and won't be found in the near future. In a world like ours, where technology rules all, a choice like Christopher's would be met with disbelief and probably derision. That only heightens the intensity of the character's message, which is also what the director aims to tell us: we need to rediscover ourselves before it's too late. It doesn't matter whether we are young or old, as the protagonist touchingly teaches an elderly man (Hal Holbrook, the only cast-member to be nominated for an Oscar), the important thing is we give it a serious try.To simply call this a film isn't enough: in one of the most amazing combinations of efforts in the history of movie-making, the story, Penn's soulful direction, Hirsch's painfully real performance (will he ever be this good again?) and Eddie Vedder's elegiac songs (an essential soundtrack for any true film-lover) merge into something that's almost too powerful to describe in words: you have to see it to believe it.Into the Wild isn't an ""easy"" film: it will leave you very affected, possibly devastated, but also as enriched as one can ever be after seeing a genuine masterwork. It will ignite real thoughts about life instead of the phony reflections so many ""issue movies"" try to induce. It will hit the gut, the heart and the mind in equal measure, and once the initial wave of emotional overflow has passed you will feel immensely rewarded. Into the Wild does this because it isn't merely a motion picture: it is art, life, freedom and nature, all together in a mesmerizing piece of visual poetry."
"I found something utterly fascinating in the true story of Christopher McCandless, venturing out into the ""wild"" of Alaska with basically nothing but a gun and some food, and eventually succumbing to the inevitable.
I passed no judgment on him or his decisions when I read through the story, focusing more on the mystery of what drove him to a vagabond existence culminating in total hermitage from which he absolutely could not survive. The cliché of ""the devil is in the details"" is one horribly true here, and tends to tear apart the story.
In truth, McCandless essentially committed suicide. He refused all the necessary help to survive in the cold, did not even learn how to dry meat, and, had he had a map, could have easily walked back to civilization at almost any point in time.
In fact, we can learn almost nothing from McCandless or his time spent in the wild, as his journal entries are as mindless and empty and almost completely devoid of any real content. They literally amount to things like ""Day 2: Fall through the ice day."" ""Day 4: Magic bus day."" ""Day 9: Weakness."" ""Day 10: Snowed in."" ""Day 68: Beaver Dam. Disaster."" ""Day 107 (the last entry): Beautiful berries""
Going into the actual film itself, we get virtually none of this. Instead we are taken on a tediously long, droning journey that covers almost none of the survival aspects and just covers his wandering through the US in the years leading up to the event.
Throughout this ""journey"" we're treated to overly dramatic musical montages waxing poetic on how ""society, man, society is just society, man"" ranting and railing with all the emptiness and incoherence of someone with basic understanding of almost everything, but knowledge of almost nothing.Life sure does sucks for a rich white kid who graduates from a prestigious university with nearly all A's, the movie tells us. How can you be happy with things like money and a job instead of living in the woods, hanging out with psychotically upbeat Danish tourists you meet after barely surviving a dangerous river paddling you jump in with 0 paddling experience, ignoring the guy who tells you you need to sign on with a professional because you could die. What does he know? Society, man. Screw society, man.
The truth about the abuse he and his sister suffered from their parents wasn't revealed publicly by the time his movie was made (though she did disclose it off the record to the book author Jon Krakauer), so it's never made fully explicit here. But the whole theme of the movie is such that it doesn't matter, because it doesn't easily fit into the theme that ""society sucks and you can only be happy living in the woods"".
The immense scale of the romanticization is insufferable. It becomes painfully pretentious almost immediately and it makes the protagonist thoroughly unlikeable; a vapid, empty vessel literally living the dream of the vapid spoiled white kid who worships nature and thinks modern society is a drag. The least I can say about this fictional version of McCandless is he is at least completely devoid of the self-righteous spite and meanness of a character like Holden Caulfield. He's not rubbing our faces in this pretentious message; the film itself is, and sometimes it seems as if he's just as much a victim as we are, having his adventure luridly fetishized as if he were an idol, and not someone who was way in over their head.
I can't help but think of a similar story of someone who died in the Alaska wilderness, Carl McCunn in 1981. He went with almost 2 tons of food and supplies, multiple weapons, and actually left highly detailed journal entries telling a tragic story of a man who made a rather different mistake; He did not make it clear to the pilot who left him in the wilderness to return for him 5 months later. As 5 months slips into 6 months, you can clearly feel the pain in his entries as he realizes he is likely never coming back alive, and no one is likely to come looking for him. At one point, he is even spotted by a state trooper flying over in a plane, but laments in his journal that he apparently accidentally signaled to the trooper that he was okay and not in need of rescue. His final entry is a plea to God to forgive him and look over his family, then writing ""They say it doesn't hurt"" before taking his own life rather than freeze to death.
There's nothing remotely like that in this film. The film barely lingers on Chris's experience of solitude in the wild, preferring to go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on with his silly adventures, interspersed with upbeat montage after montage set to popular music"
"He died stupid. I have lived in Alaska, and I picked up the DVD out of a nostalgia for the place. Apparently the producers did not bother about Alaskan conditions or the realities of ""living on the land"" before shooting this dog. We have an idealist who burns money and gives his college fund to Oxfam to feed others, but in his wending west seems never to turn down a free meal or a free ride, while turning down implied and implicit offers to adopt him by those who have lost children, and turning down sex from a 16-year-old (ethical, but a bit out of place in a hippie encampment). He gets good advice from all the nice people he meets (the only not-nice person in the film is the railroad guard who beats him) and apparently forgets it all on the spot. In Alaska, it really gets silly. Apparently he is somewhere in the Tanana Valley, if his plant book is anything to go by, living in a steel bus hull lacking a window or two. I know a family who wintered in Tok (in that valley) in an insulated tent with no windows: they cut and burned a cord of wood _daily_ to survive (they did have a chainsaw). He apparently stops cutting wood entirely after gathering some sticks on a beach in California. Certainly, he lucks out in the matter of light--whoever abandoned the bus apparently left gallons and gallons of oil behind--he is never in the dark. Or without matches, for that matter. He kills a cow moose, apparently with a .22, which is really wonderful shooting--moose have been known to pay about as much attention to .22 bullets as they do to yellowjackets. In good weather, he seems to spend his time mooning in the bus instead of hunting, fishing, or bringing in wood for next winter. When he gets desperate for food to the point of delirium, he eats the wrong plant and poisons himself. It was depressing to learn that this was a ""real"" story, that a genuine kid apparently was this appealing and this dumb. I am sorry for his family who were, according to him, terrible parents. All of our parents were terrible in one way or another. Most of us get over it, at least those of us who live past 23."
"This film takes you on a journey of McCandless. A smart youngman from a well off family who becomes disillusioned by the mess that hides under the covers of their priveleged life. He sheds himself of his trust fund, his car, Ivy league college and all the things nepotism offers as he goes searching for his own identity.He was hailed as a leader and an above intelligent student. But when he peels the layers of the ""priveleged"" perspectives, just how much of that is true? Just what are the boundaries of his ""priveleges"" and would he make it without it? Just who is McCandless?This film is a spiritual ride as he travels the heartlands of America coming accross people of all background. He begins to challenge his old self and come face to face with nature. The only thing better than the film may be the soundtrack by Eddie Vedder. The only thing better than that is the novel by Krakauer."
"For the most part I liked the plot, and I chose it because it was based on a book by Jon Krakauer.However, I was turned off by how spoiled and inconsiderate he was. His parents fought when he was young, okay, whose didn't? Now they want to buy him a car and put him through law school - this is what he needs to escape from? We should all have such problems! It was also unforgivable of him to take off without a word to anyone, and to burn money just because he was above that sort of thing after enjoying a comfortable upbringing. I'm sure that money could have fed or clothed someone.And his life savings? Sounds noble, but would he have had it if his parents hadn't paid to put him through a top school? I like to think that he would have learned something from the experience if he had survived it though, given the chance. Although the attention probably would have made him even more self-centered.It's the kind of experience we all dream of having, but very few actually do. Hopefully, the few who do are better prepared for it than this guy."
"Having read many excellent negative reviews of this movie, I figured I should try to come up with a positive one. While I hated the movie myself, I can honestly highly recommend ""Into the Wild"" to certain people under certain conditions.""Into the Wild"" would make an excellent teaching tool for film professors to show their students what not to do when making a film. It turns out to be a pretty comprehensive survey. The egregious overuse of alternative camera techniques is a good cautionary tale. Folks who want to see some nostalgic camera angles that haven't been used since the original ""Batman"" series might be particularly pleased. Also, since there is at least 60 minutes of unnecessary footage left in the film by the editors, you could use this as an opportunity to have students edit the movie themselves.There are endless opportunities for party games you could invent around this movie. Have your party guests take a drink every time there's a cheesy camera shot or redundant voice-over or caption. You can also play ""mute the film and guess the dialogue."" Whoever comes closest to the actual dialogue wins, and whoever can't predict what is being said at all gets thrown out of the party.Other reviewers have already mentioned the movie's potential as a sleep aid. I don't know if I would go that far, but I think ""Into the Wild"" would make a great background to working out. There is something about watching a movie make the same point over and over for over 2 hours, to bad music, that reminds me of the rigors of exercise. Repetition, pain, fatigue, and ultimately relief that it's over."
"Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch) is the son of Billie McCandless (Marcia Gay Harden) and Walt McCandless (William Hurt) and older brother of Carine McCandless (Jena Malone), When he graduates from Emory University, he has grade to join Havard. Instead, he gives the savings for charity and decides to travel to Alaska to live in the wilderness using the alias Alexander Supertramp. Along his journey, Alex meets persons that supports and like him. But he proceeds with his of hermit with tragic end. ""Into the Wild"" is a long and overrated film based on the true story of the tragic journey of a spoiled and selfish dreamer. After graduating, Chris McCandless decides to leave his life of petit bourgeois, his family, his possessions and achievements because he has two childhood traumas: he learnt that their parents were not married when he was younger and he witnessed their arguments. Therefore, it is an unsatisfactory explanation for such drastic attitude. Chris does not send news to his parents since he hates them. But his sister suffers with the absence of news from her brother and he is so selfish that he does not call or write a letter even for her. Another strange point is no reference to drugs in the hippie camps. Therefore, the story is unpleasant and weird as a drama. The cinematography and the locations are the best this movie can offer to the viewer. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Na Natureza Selvagem"" (""Into the Wilderness"")"
"I saw this movie at an advanced screening in Nashville on August 23, 2007. Although it was a little long, it was a great movie.The movie follows an Emory grad who struggles to find the meaning of life. He travels across the country (ultimately to Alaska) and along the way he touches lives and becomes a man.This movie really makes a person reevaluate their priorities in life and I personally found it to be inspiring. The director did a beautiful job with the story line and the landscapes were incredible.Vince Vaughn plays a small part and is his usual lovable self. Emile Hirsch was wonderful and has a bright future in acting. One shocker was the random brief nudity of men and women.This movie is worth seeing at least once."
"This movie is it. It was very difficult to separate my own personal taste from objective review but after a day or two of simmering I think I can encapsulate my thoughts on this truly disappointing movie.Basic things like expository narration. This is a movie not a radio play. Having the redundant narration of his sister (which was very poorly done) sounding like an actor reading through lines in a coffee shop rehearsal lacked authenticity and constantly removed you from the ability to make your own conclusions about the emotional state of the characters. The choice to have on multiple occasions Chris stare directly at the camera utterly baffled me. Moments like that (say at the ending of Magnolia) should generally be reserved for situations where character and audience through the weight and momentum of the story are drawn to some mutual realization (not exclusively but you get my drift). Once is maybe OK but, again, as with the narration, the self-centred direction is encouraging us to accept the movie's supposed profundity by continually doing this amateurish nonsense rather than having the confidence to let the story stand on its own merit. Very, very lame direction there.The dialogue was utterly unbelievable and preachy. Now I can take a story with a moral focus or political slant as much as the next guy but it seems like a case of a writer not having a clue what a screenplay is supposed to be. Actions should be more important than words or at least on equal footing but in this movie, words are not parts of conversations between the characters or even thoughtful narration but rather some sermon directed AT the audience. The movie was like its own good review..""Look at how sublime I am! Look at how profound I am!""The acting by everyone except Hirsch was good. Hirsch was a single note playing for two and half hours. Zero empathy was derived from his monochrome performance. The character begins self-centred and dies self-centred. It could be argued that his ""call it by its real name"" blathering was monumental change in his character that was the culmination of this journey but it was sabotaged by an actor with no range and a director with no confidence in either the story or its performers. Instead we are left with everything being spelled out for us ..yet again.. about how seeing the world through Chris' eyes is the only way to see the world.The only reason I didn't give I a single star was because it looked great. This movie was a pretty big insult I think, since attempts to spiritualize a character or more correctly, spiritualize his ""experiences"", without ever giving the audience a chance to empathize. Instead we get sermonized. This DVD is only good as a coaster for my drink."
"I would rate it a zero if possible. The movie was so boring and contrived that I felt nauseous after the first hour. The randomly placed narrations by Jena Malone were laughable. The storyline is so bland that I felt like I ordered a sand smoothie at the concessions stand. After you see this film (if you can call it that) you have an insight into the spoiled kid mentality. Written by a privileged male who obviously yearned for a challenge, an adventure, something other than their actual drab, guided existence. The problem, though, is that this story is told as if it was a campfire tale. Complete with embellishments and drama to the point of being unbelievable and humorous. Like I said I walked out of the theater. I wish I had asked for a refund. Sean Penn owes me $16.00!"
"This was a very unsatisfying movie. It starts out with promise and spectacularly fails to deliver . Where to start? The basic premise of a chap going off to live alone in the wild with adventures all along the way is a good one. But nothing really interesting or compelling ever happens in this. The best thing about travelling and wandering about the world is all the interesting and unusual characters you meet along the way. But I can't describe the tedious, one dimensional humourless dullards our 'hero' meets. The long drawn out 'deep' interactions they have about nothing except how sad and unhappy their lives are. All so full of pain.Deep people aren't full of pain. Deep people are people with something to say. The scenery was nice though and there was some camera work going on but that can't make up for flat characters, a dead script, lack of a cohesive storyline that develops (this was just a collage of fragments of happenings strung together going everywhere but nowhere) bad acting and most of all any real philosophical idea behind it. After all, people take off into the wild alone for deep reasons regarding their relationship to modern society not just because they had a tiff with their parents and like eating squirrels. There was a point where some tensions develop in the killing of a big bull thing and you expected that our boy was becoming a man with all the challenges. But then it took a serious dive when he goes back to the hippies and meets a very pretty but incredibly shallow girl and quickly reverts back to being a child again. From then on it never picks up and draws out slowly and interminably to a sad ending. I've said enough. The fact that so many think this worth and 8 rating just shows how shallow and dumb most people are. Perhaps I should go find myself a nice shack in the woods of Montana ....................."
"The best stories are those that even the greatest novelists couldn't make up. Real life, the real world creates some incredible adventures led by incredible characters. In this film, we follow one of the most amazing true stories ever captured on film. Into the Wild is a very deep and engaging one-man trip through the unknown portions of the United States. Based off the best-seller written by John Krakauer, Into the Wild is about a man that gives up all his material possessions and life altogether in search of purpose, in search of happiness, and in search of a direction to head towards in his life. Written and directed by Sean Penn with a lot of love and detail, this movie is beautifully shot, beautifully edited, and even though the third act drags quite a bit, you'll remain hooked on Christopher McCandless' travels up until the bitter end. In case you had not read the startling true story, Christopher McCandless was a very gifted athlete and student with high marks and an extremely bright future. But, spiritually, he was extremely lost; emotionally, he was empty. Upon this, he donates all his money to charity and runs away from his family, his college, everything he had worked for. Now, whatever your stance is on his decision-making, we can all agree he was clearly a man that was lost, and needed to be found. You can be unhappy for only so long before you decide to do something drastic. Some move to another city, some pursue a new career, some search for love. In his case, he chose to become one with nature. Like I said, you can question his common sense and decisions, but don't question his desire for something more. Sean Penn and John Krakeuer clearly admired the emotional strength and bravery of our main character, as they infused his story with a lot of love, a lot of content, and a lot of overall emotion.The main core and best element in this film is the overall acting. While not one performance stood out, everyone did an exceptional job. Emile Hirsch does a spectacular job portraying a strong-willed yet spiritually lost man hellbent on achieving true happiness. The smaller roles (people Christopher meets during his journey) added charm to the overall flick, including Vince Vaughn, Kristen Stewart, Hal Halbrook, and Catherine Keener. The writing supported the acting, as not one line sounds forced or shoved upon, and it adds an added layer of realism to the already-true story. The directing however is a bit of a mixed bag. Sean Penn really loved this story and definitely displayed it with the elongated running time, insistence on shooting every scene on location, and the artsy final moments; but sometimes the French-style directing was a bit too much. There are instances in which the characters look at the camera and make faces or pose, and that totally breaks down the fourth wall and throws you away from the main structure of the film. You realize it's a movie and not a story when the main character glares at the camera for a few split seconds. Then the final act, when the climax drags, hinders the overall quality of the movie. Approximately ten minutes could have been cut from the last third and it would have been fine. Finally, we have the controversial element of morality. Sometimes, moral codes amongst each of us prevent us from sympathizing with the main character, leading to some issues. A recent example is Sex and the City's first movie's final act, which results in us totally losing sympathy for the main four (with the exception of one, but avoiding spoilers). Into the Wild also suffers from this. While we can clearly understand and see the frustrations of Christopher against the world we live in, his actions are heavily on the selfish side, despite what he's gone through. Instead of seeing a man that has suffered through the childhood and teenage years and needed to escape everything, we see a person so closed-minded on his journey that he shuts off all the people that cared about him throughout his trip. All the offers of help he received, and he practically shuns them all (especially the final human encounter, in an especially gut-wrenching scene). Upon seeing this, the viewer knows how he is going to end up. And whether or not you'll feel sorry for him is entirely up to you, the witness to all his decisions.Bottom Line: Enjoy the journey, even if the destination and bumps on the road is going to create some discussions and disagreeing points. Into the Wild is a wonderful film that is beautifully shot, despite the direction being misguided at some instances. Once you get past the questionable directing though, prepare for a visually stimulating trip chronicling the adventures of a man on a self-discovery expedition like nothing else seen before on film. While this movie will not convince you to do what he did, it will lead you to questions concerning fulfillment, love, faith, and happiness. Into the Wild is about a journey in search of answers, and despite it being a beautifully flawed (mildly) flick, it does lead to more questions. Great movie to emotionally digest, just do it slowly.P.S. Where on earth is Eddie Vedder's Oscar for his musical contribution?"
"If you look into the real story of Chris McCandless you will see that he was a kid, with some mental probs, that made some very bad choices in life. The movie by sean penn glamorizes his useless death in he Hollywood way. I guess I should not put all the blame on penn though, he did not write the book. The book which had many inaccuracies, one of which is that Chris was poisoned by seeds. No toxins were found in the food in Chris's bus. He simply starved to death because he was did not know how to survive in the wild. He was only a days hike away from one of the busies roads in Alaska. Since the movie has come out many, many people have made this hike with no problems. Chris was simply a kid with some mental health issues that were not treated. The movie glamorizes an idea that Hollywood types like penn like in theory. Down with commercialization, the money spun world of greed, money money money. You know its all bad mentality. Of course I don't see penn giving away all his money to charity like Chris did. WOnder why??"
"This film was a massive disappointment given the high rating on IMDb. The characters do not come across well and don't encourage any empathy. The relationships between the lead character and the people that he meets on his trip are overly sickly sweet and seem to happen overnight and don't feel credible at all. It is sad that this film is based on a true story given the outcome and the lack of communication with his family, but ultimately it is not a particularly good film and I wouldn't say the acting was anything particularly commendable. I would describe this as a fairly weak 'coming of age' film with higher pretensions, and the only difference being is that it has a sad and unfortunate ending."
"The main character, Chris, started to annoy me almost immediately and the feeling grew as the movie progressed. Who would be so self-centered and selfish that they would burn their money? At least leave it under a rock for some poor traveler to enjoy! He travels by bumming rides (and food) from others -- how hypocritical can the ""self-sufficient"" man become? He's happy he found a straw hat in a field -- are we supposed to respect him for that? Perhaps if he had had the skill to make the hat himself, he might have earned some grudging respect. Then he hikes ""into the wild"" in Alaska (after having bummed yet another ride) and settles in an abandoned bus. He's nothing but a gigantic parasite, going on interminably about how evil money is, while at the same time enjoying the fruits of other people's labor (and money), even if some of the items have been discarded. I wish he had never found the bus, but had had to live under a tree. How long would he have lasted then? To top off his irresponsible behavior and total selfishness, he simply disappears without informing his family, causing them no end of emotional stress. I'm sorry, this character was just an asshole. I'm only halfway into the movie right now, but having read other spoilers, I know he eventually dies, apparently in a senseless fashion. I perversely find myself looking forward to this event, as horrible as that sounds. I cannot believe that this movie was nominated for an Oscar. It's a silly movie about a completely unlikeable and annoyingly naive fool who in the end gets what he deserves."
"Oh dear. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. This film is in the IMDb top 250? How on earth did that happen?I wont even dignify a breakdown of the story. All you need to know is that the main character dies. From his own stupidity. From his own stubourness. And I felt absolutely nothing for him. Worse than that, I was happy that the arrogant, selfish little prick got exactly what he deserved. Inside I laughed a little and I am sure that is not what the director was going for.He put his family through hell for nothing other than selfishness. There is an attempt to blame this/justify it on his parents behaviour - hey Sherlock, parents are not perfect. And yours seemed pretty good, they provided for you, gave you a good home and brought you up to the extent that you had the whole world in the palm of your hand. But you threw it away because you were a grade A douche.What makes me really angry and confused is that this piece of crap is so unlikeable and the choices he made so stupid but Penn has crafted a film that would have you believe he is a hero. There is no objectivity in this at all - he was a brave young soul for doing what he did. Honest, please believe me.I could continue spitting vitriol but there are plenty of other reviews that do that so much better. All I will say is that if you are ever inclined to watch this pile of trash run away very, very quickly."
"After the first 10 or fifteen minutes of this incredibly long movie, my eyes began to glaze over - - and remained that way throughout the remaining 2 plus hours. Why did I continue to watch the rest of it? I assumed (incorrectly) that at some point something meaningful would pop up - - and/or that the pace of the movie would pick up. Unfortunately neither happened. It continued at an agonizingly slow pace and the only thing of consequence that presented itself was some attractive scenery. But I can watch scenery via virtually any of the thousands of travelogues which are available. I must echo that which another viewer observed, that this movie should have and easily could have been edited to 30 minutes or so, and have been offered by Sundance or a similar venue. Do I recommend it? Only to those who can't seem to find anything else to watch."
"Uninteresting and very boring story about a selfish, arrogant man, blaming all his problems on his parents, who runs away from his family to live in the wilderness for 4 months before he finds out that happiness is found in the company of other people and family.

"Saw this movie last night with BAFTA - before I go any further, let me just say that the cinematography is amazingly beautiful and ""big"".The comments from another reviewer about the ""shocking random human nudity"" baffled me. If you would find the brief sight of a flaccid willy, a topless female sunbather and a 2-second distance shot of a bunch of naturists shocking, then beware! But there was nothing of a sexual nature, and nothing I would not allow my 6 year old grandson to see.Other than the above comments, I am afraid I have mainly negatives.This is the story of a privileged young college graduate who studied various calamities in Africa as part of his schooling. His only personal calamity is that he has parents who have been less than truthful to him about their family history, and who have the audacity to argue in front of him during his childhood. He appears to want some personal angst so badly that he uses this to fuel his requirement for his own ""personal issues"".In order to ""understand his true nature"" (yuk!) he drops out of the education system and goes walkabout in the wilds - another prime motive for which appears to be to punish his parents for their sin of being less than truthful to him during his upbringing.I do not think a European audience will warm to the story of such a self-indulgent, cruel character who appears to have no empathy for the people he emotionally hurts, and at 150 minutes I almost felt I had gone through a trial equal to that undergone by the character in the film.What I also do not get is the big deal about living in the wilderness - replete with hunter's rifle, gas lighters and various other technological accoutrements including a derelict bus. Again, another America-centric theme: this time of ""frontiersmanship"" I would suggest.Finally, I would say that the lack of empathy I felt for the character meant that the narrative did not touch me or make me care about his fate - and the way Emile Hirsch occasionally played to the camera, like a fly-on-the-wall reality show, broke the spell of ""suspending belief"" that is so critical in allowing yourself to be immersed in the story - it suddenly reminded me that I was merely watching a film All-in-all, I would recommend steering clear."
"I'm amazed at some of the press I've read about this movie an it's main character. I watched the movie because I thought it was going to be about a guy who takes off to live in the wilds of Alaska. I assumed it would be about his preparation and chock full of information about how he did it. I didn't realize it was a true story until the end. Boy was I let down. The entire movie is about some selfish brat who disappeared without so much as a postcard or phone call to his mother or sister. His animosity towards his father might excuse letting dad know about where he was, but his mom and sister? That's about as self centered as you can get, which leads me to doubt the films integrity concerning the family dynamics and Chris's relationship with his father. Whatever his reasons for doing that to Dad, doing it to the rest of his family is sick.According to the Wikipedia entry, and a couple other articles I've read online, there is absolutely no evidence that he poisoned himself by eating the wrong plant (as depicted in the film). He starved to death, plain and simple, because he wasn't prepared for what he encountered in Alaska. If the filmmaker manufactured that, then perhaps he manufactured a few other things too. One mile from where he tried to cross the river was a manually operated tram he could have used to cross. If he had explored a little, or bothered to bring a map, he would have known about it. Intead of being a wonderful story about a guy going to Alaska to live off the land, it's a story of a self-centered brat, whose parents gave him everything, so he gave his money to charity and disappears without a trace, tearing his family's hearts out. Oh yeah, he had a pretty cool cross country adventure which I'm sure his family would have loved to hear about.He should have died in the Colorado river, and saved me about 45 minutes of waiting for him to get to the Alaskan wilderness.Maybe a younger person, or somebody without children, would find something else in this movie. I tried but couldn't do it."
"I felt Krakauer's story was compelling enough. For Sean Penn to throw such fictionalized crap into the mix, it is hard to accept.McCandless was barely developed as a character and what we see is a very self-absorbed, humorless, one-dimensional kid. Penn's anti-government views are unnecessarily thrown into the movie--the rude ranger at Lee's Ferry and the sheriff's boat blasting their siren through the Grand Canyon, unable to catch up to a kayaker, sure. The idea of McCandless pushing his kayak on a shopping cart 42 miles from Page to Lee's Ferry was also absurd. The whole kayak-through-the-Grand-Canyon story line was totally unfathomable. How many idiots will try it now? As was Wayne Westerberg getting busted by the FBI (for what--driving his combine too fast? Why does Vince Vaughn have to be in every goddamn movie?), McCandless burning all his money yet holding on to his gold watch, (all vagabonds who are rejecting society need to know the exact time), McCandless riding the rails, (stereotypical ""bull"" encounter--but did McCandless ever hop a train? I don't think so), McCandless not giving Ron a hug or at least a handshake when he said goodbye to him, McCandless hiking up his belt another notch about fifty times (must be losing weight, duh), McCandless not having a discernible personality, McCandless about to phone his parents but thinking the better of it (what was the point of that?) Also hard to believe was McCandless not banging the Tracy chick (Tolstoy would have banged her!) This must be Penn's version of McCandless deification, that he was too ""moral"" to bang a hot chick in the middle of the desert.The hippie couple and Tracy were good actors. Hal Holbrook, good to see he's still alive. Emile Hirsch at least looked like McCandless, good to see Sean Penn didn't turn him into a Haitian stowaway or a guy with scissorhands. Hard to understand why he was mugging for the camera, though. The whacked-out Danish couple on remote beach seemed realistic. There are lots of nude and nearly nude European tourists running around remote parts of the American west. That was the movie's biggest connection with me.Eddie Vedder's soundtrack was totally forgettable. You suck, dude. I guess we should be thankful Helen Reddy wasn't Sean Penn's buddy in the music industry, eh? Too bad no ""Travelin' Man""/Bob Seger, ""Ramble On""/Led Zep, even some old '70's Jackson Browne or '60's Byrds would have helped. And since McCandless was out there during the pinnacle of the grunge era, some music from that period also seemed required. ""King of the Road""/Roger Miller was the only tune that fit.McCandless in LA, McCandless catching a train out of LA, McCandless getting beat up by the ""bull"", McCandless having a weird Sean Penn moment where he imagines he is Leonardo DiCaprio at a Hollywood party ... I doubt any of those things ever actually happened. And like I said, I thought the original story was compelling enough.Good to see The Gap (S of Page) and the road leading down to Lee's Ferry on the big screen, but I doubt McCandless ever went down it. There wasn't any particular shot that came close to capturing the real essence of hitching, and what a freaking shame. McCandless can't even say ""thanks for the ride"". Stunning how Sean Penn can make a movie about the most famous hitchhiker of our lifetime and not have even one consultant on the set who has ever hitched.The scene where McCandless mocks elderly man Ron for not making the ""most"" of his life left a particularly bad taste in my mouth. If someone puts you up overnight for an extended time and wants to adopt you, be gracious about it, not a sanctimonious jerk. I'm sure Chris McCandless' parents were thrilled to see their son depicted this way.Also hard to believe is that no one came forward during the making of the movie to further clarify McCandless' journey. No rides in Canada, nothing. Rather than fictionalize what may have happened that Krakauer didn't unearth in his research, Penn fictionalizes what did happen. In reality, McCandless kayaked from below Parker Dam to the Sea of Cortez through relatively tame Colorado River waters. Penn has him negotiating class 4 rapids in the heart of the Grand Canyon--a total sell-out to attract the extreme sport crowd.Closing shot totally ridiculous. The river looks to be about ankle deep, and it's flowing from the wrong direction. No attempt by McCandless to even cross the river. What a joke.From what I read, McCandless in real life was a congenial guy, a great bar person. He had a joie de vivre for hitching and meeting other people. He wasn't the single-minded, Alaska-obsessed prick that Penn makes him out as being. That's what I choose to believe. Shame on Sean Penn for not illuminating us more as to who Chris McCandless actually was.Krakauer's version of ending with Billie and Walt McCandless helicoptering in to visit the bus was gut-wrenching enough for me. Too bad it wasn't good enough for Sean Penn, that great Hollywood visionary."
"Biographies are usually about people we wish we had known, people whose lives were of great significance or filled with drama. I think of Patton or Laurence of Arabia or many others. I am sure as movie fans that you can fill in the blanks. Now Sean Penn offers us Christopher McCandless. Who? Was his life a subject for cinema? Let's see. He lived a boring uneventful life tooling around in the wild for a while (should be some dramatic music here) usually by mooching off others or off the technology and civilization he abhorred. He created nothing. He changed nothing. He shaped nothing. He selfishly and thoughtlessly abandoned his family including a sister who loved him and never did him a bit of harm. He managed to walk away from everyone who ever cared about him or wanted to befriend him or help him. He had that always charming arrogance of those who believe they have all the answers to life that us lesser people just can't see. We insist on having a shower in the morning and not having lice in our hair or stinking. More the fools us. Apparently smelling back and hopping freight trains is some king of revelation of truth. If only we would abandon all this modern science and technology and just pee on a tree or look at a mountain. There has always been a cult that believed the secret was to run away. Somehow wasting your life doing nothing is better than spending it trying to actually contribute something. Just be. Just breathe. That's the ticket. Well that is the difference between us and animals. We try to do something, to learn something and make something and we fail and we try again. We do not run away. Why would anyone want to spend over two hours watching this pathetic loser destroy himself. It is like watching grizzly man. One is just waiting and let's be honest, hoping for a bear to get hungry and the real truth to be revealed. Like the grizzly, the wild is not your friend. It is beautiful to look at but you do not belong there. It will kill you for just that reason. Good bye Christopher. Let's hope there is no sequel."
"For me, this was by far the single most pretentious and overrated mainstream film of 2007. Even without reading the article on Wiki, I guessed that this guy was either schizo or bipolar. For a guy who supposedly majored in History and Anthropology, Chris McCandless was hugely sentimental and romantic, and ultimately just foolish. So he reads Tolstoy and Thoreau, and trudges off into the wild ?? Perhaps he ought to have read some Kafka and Dostoevsky too : he would have realized that for man there is simply no escaping himself and the world. So yes, society is indeed based on mutual deception and empty conventions, but rejecting everyone and everything isn't the solution. Far from it. Its much more challenging to be a part of society and yet try to lead an authentic life. How many such radicals and ""total solutions"" have we already seen in the past ?? They always fail.The film itself sheds zero light on the motives of the real Chris McCandless. I don't think it tells the truth about what actually happened to him. He lives in an alternate universe where he can happily live in the wild and on city streets after living a pampered upper-class life for 22 years. No troubles, no complaints. And throughout its long runtime, the film goes on hammering the point that society and civilized men are terrible, and bums, hippies and the dregs of society are the Lord's cherished angels.It figures that Sean Penn, the fashionable self-styled outsider, would make something like this. Its right up his alley. I didn't enjoy this at all. Above all else, its dreamy and unrealistic. Its an ironic film, in that its a lesson for young people what NOT to do, i.e. turn your back on your responsibilities and look for ultimate solutions."
"I use IMDb scores as a pretty good guide to a film. If it's over 8/10 I'm pretty much guaranteed I'll enjoy it.Not this time. This was the worst film I've seen this year.The main character was unbearably smug. It was nauseating seeing him almost punch the air at his good fortune, giving it all away and living for the moment. Ho hum, here comes another pan-out on a helicopter. Most of the film felt like an ad but the cans of coke never arrived. In fact ads these days have more conflict in it than this film.I kept wishing ill on him just so we could have a little tension. Sure, a few parental issues but they loved him very much. The negative should have come out a lot stronger. Instead we are narrated the story by the only character more mawkish than our hero, his sister.I'm a nature buff who's lived an unconventional life with lots of travel. But really, it took him two years, 2.5 hours of film and endless philosophising to realise that people need company? Come on. Maybe if he had time to watch one Hollywood blockbuster, he would have learned that and we could have all saved ourselves the bother."
"This movie reflects the typical mom and dad's rich boy that is tired of being rich so he wants to break the bonds with society. Interestingly, he keeps taking advantage of what society has to offer, like a society's leech: taking rides from people, going by train without paying his ticket, getting free food from poor souls that pitied him, etc. Into the ""wild""... was that the case? The first thing he did once he arrived to Alaska was to live in an abandoned van with ""heater"", oil, matches, rice?! I didn't know you could grow rice in Alaska in the middle of the hard winter... Everyday you learn something new. My favorite part was when he, a rich boy, was going to stay at the shelter, surrounded by poor people. I wonder what the indigents would say if they knew he was loaded. Its a stupid movie about the life of a tired to be rich boy that could only be liked by people that do not appreciate what they have. Its an insult. I cant believe people worship stupids like this pseudo-intellectual kid. Not worth watching."
"what a disappointment with such a great potential for a great story. What Pean has done is make a film about a loser that runs away from home and dies poisoned by his own dumbness. He didn't have an opportunity to enjoy nature and its freedom and was unsuccessful at all his attempts even tho he had all the time in the world and the books and didn't read them. The first thing anyone in the wild would do is think and find out was is poison and what is not, and certainly learning to skin animals is a rather important part of survival in the wild. the poor kid just thought knowledge would come to him through divine intervention and by giving his money away (his chicken to the church) somehow would insure happiness in paradise. This was done with either plain dumbness or laziness. He did however prove that youth is wasted on the young!"
"I am generally easy to please when it comes to films. Prior to this, the worst thing I could say about a film was that it was a bit dull. Into the Wild changed all of that. I can only imagine what the real Christopher was like, but if this is supposed to portray him in a positive light, I doubt he had many redeeming features. Every single thing he did made me hate him more. To begin with, he had a fantastic life. As the summary on this website says, he was a 'top student and athlete'. He had a decent sum of money for a student, and a family who cared for him. So what does he do? He throws all of it away on a whim. He gives his money away, destroys everything he owns and completely abandons civilisation, all without telling his family a thing. This is one of the most reckless, selfish, idiotic, inconsiderate things I have ever heard of. I understand wanting to reconnect with nature, I understand that people feel that society is too materialistic. If you want to indulge those feelings, go camping. Go on safari. Volunteer for a charity. What you do not do is throw away your entire life. And if you do decide to destroy everything you have ever achieved, you could at least have the common courtesy to tell your parents where you are. He could easily have kept in touch with his family while on his insane quest. All he accomplished by keeping quiet was making his parents fear for his life. Fear which was perfectly justified, considering the ending. On his journey into the depths of stupidity, he met several people who were inexplicably sympathetic to his situation. They offered him every opportunity to live his life with them. He had every chance to abandon his aimless wandering, but he turned them all down. Why? Because he was convinced that he knew better than everybody else. He ends up dying due to his own bottomless stupidity when he eats poisonous berries, despite the fact that he had a guidebook which told him which berries were safe to eat. Any reasonable person would consult the book BEFORE eating the mystery fruits. I hated everything about him, throughout the film my fists were usually clenched. When he died at the end of the film, I imagine the audience was supposed to cry. I laughed out loud for five minutes. I know that makes me sound like a monster, but it's the truth. If a team of psychologists and writers studied me for years on end and created a character whose sole purpose was to make me angry, they would not even come close to the blinding fury that I experienced watching this film. As terrible as this sounds, I am glad Christopher McCandless is dead."
"Oh my god, this guy really starved himself to death? Gave himself diarrhea and died in a beat up Volkswagen? And that's what I spent hours watching?This movie is a horrible waste of time, and even if you like the protagonists you will find them incredibly annoying after three hours of more or less the same rubbish.So the guy is a teenager who is misunderstood and has his own notions of how the world should be. Which teenager doesn't? Most end up surviving those fragile years. It hardly takes any skill at all. But, as Darwin predicted, some are not destined to stay and procreate, and luckily this is one such case.I endured to see what would happen in the end, I felt I've invested so much free time in it already that I deserved to know. I couldn't help but laugh when the movie ended.Seriously, don't watch it!"
"His parents pay for his education and by of thanks he heads for the territories. His first act of independence is to park his car in a cutbank in the desert, an excellent method for taking a late night muddy swim. He then wanders the land in search of truth and justice, eventually hooking up with some latter day hippies who are a little wiser but not much smarter. He calls himself a tramp but since he burned his money he's really a bum mooching his way across America . Wouldn't you just love to find this guy hanging around your favorite summer retreat mooning away for walden pond. A great beginning for a summer vacation. He and his naivete eventually arrive in the frozen wilderness of Alaska where he thinks poetry and wishful thinking will provide sustenance. This pilgrim should have stayed with his mommy."
"If Chris wanted to see Alaska he should have booked himself a room on Celebrity or Princess. They have warm beds, gambling and all the maggot-free moose you can eat.Actually, I won't argue the merits of Chris' little adventure, suffice to say if I were going to throw myself in the wilderness I would have watched some episodes of Survivorman and got me some good Boy Scout books.My beef is with the movie-making. It was preachy, self-indulgent and frankly unwatchable. Hirsch isn't a bad actor (Alpha Dog was scary), but in this 2 &1/2 piece of hero worship he comes across as an Actor playing the part. Not one believable note. Not one.Penn might have done himself a favor by casting unknowns. I don't know what everybody else sees in this movie but count me among those who thought it was a stinker."
"How did the bus get there? Of all the questions (pseudo and real) that Sean Penn's latest film, Into The Wild, is so manifestly trying to provoke- and in a semi-retarded hippy-cum-tree hugger sort of way, this most basic and elemental plot point is never addressed. But, more on that later.The film is based upon the 1996 nonfiction bestseller by Jon Krakauer, about a spoiled rich white suburban boy who basically commits suicide in the Alaskan wilderness, although he is so painfully unaware of the real world that he does not even know his own dark- almost Objectivist, impulses, and where they will lead. The book the film is based upon was a good read, even if one might question the wisdom of making a martyr out of such a delusional narcissist as Christopher Johnson McCandless (Emile Hirsch)- the 24 year old who starved to death on the aforementioned bus, after accidentally poisoning himself with inedible berries, in the middle of Alaska's wilds, after adopting the pseudonym Alexander Supertramp.The lead character is simply annoyingly repellant- perhaps only Roberto Benigni's lead character, Guido, in the awful Life Is Beautiful, makes a viewer more actively root for the character's death. In that film the lead character is so annoying that one actually roots for the Nazis to kill him, and in this film McCandless is so pompous and the film so long (140 minutes, compared to a book barely over 200 pages) that, at the hour mark, one wishes he'd just die already, so one can vacate the theater. But, no relief will come for over an hour. But, as repellant as Chris McCandless, the character, is, the direction by Sean Penn- in his first truly big budget feature, is ATROCIOUS! Yes, Penn is a great actor, but his direction, and even worse screenplay, make this film a chore. Only some stellar acting, mostly by supporting actors, saves this film from total disaster. That so many people identify and sympathize with this unfortunately deluded and hollow young loser bespeaks how little they even notice themselves, and their own flaws, much less the many other McCandlesses that proliferate in cafes across the nation. Life is as real, both for the good and ill, in a New York City deli, a doctor's waiting room, or in a tenement, as it is on the peak of Mount Everest, riding the tube of a forty foot wave in Hawaii, or trekking through the Amazon. McCandless never learned this for no one seemed to care enough to even try to stop him. Of course, even had they, he was so selfish and uncaring of others' feelings, that he likely would not have been deterred. And, Penn would likely not have cared to make a film about such a character, anyway.So, given the predetermined mess of this film, I return to the opening query- how did the bus, which the film refers to as 'magic'- thank you to The Who, get there? A Google search reveals the bus was fortuitously left by a highway construction company, decades earlier, to be used as a waystation for hikers, hunters, and campers. Since everything else in this film is so obvious, I just thought you'd want to know that and, also, to avoid this film. Thank me later."
"First of all, I'd have to say that this movie is well made and well acted. That said, it's total crap. You know the plot. Self-indulgent kid with no real problems decides to chuck it all and make his way to Alaska. Apparently, he is angry at everyone and everything for no particular reason. Suffice to say, he meets his doom, freezing to death in an old bus in Alaska.There are very few movies in which I wanted to slap the protagonist and this is one of them. Does he have a problem with his parents? Not really. He feels no relationship towards them, though. A good part of the film is narrated by his sister, evidently she is writing about him in a diary or something. I felt like screaming at the screen, ""Dude, even if your parents don't love you, your sister does. She misses you and wants you to come home."" On a brighter note, this gets my award for the worst movie with the best soundtrack. Eddie Vedder, turning to a more Bruce Springsteen/Woody Guthrie frame of mind, wrote some outstanding tunes for the soundtrack, including ""Hard Sun"". I'm a huge Pearl Jam fan, have been since I was 14, and this is some of the best stuff Vedder has ever written. Get the soundtrack instead."
"This wholly misguided effort attempts to celebrate the self destruction of a mentally ill man.Even more odd is how the narrative attempts to convey some kind of perversion of a redemptive character arc.Ironically, the film is inadvertently symbolic of the hardcore American Left -- showcases the naivete, misguided ego and ultimate reckoning of those whom Lenin allegedly anointed ""useful idiots.""But then, what would one expect from the naive, misguided ego of Sean Penn?Brings to mind the 1942 Italian production of Ayn Rand's ""We The Living"" (""Noi vivi""), of which the misguided Mussolini was so proud...because he didn't grasp how the film undercut his own warped political philosophy."
"This is a great movie, which makes you think of your life. I don't know why did I cry so hard when I saw this movie. Maybe the character Christopher (Alex) resembled my own life. And I think, it resembles the life of every guy to a certain extent, as everyone of us go for escapism at some points of our life due to various pressures. This movie shows the life of a man who leaves every thing, absolutely everything and go for an ultimate and pure escapism, and what does he learn and realize at the end. With awesome Eddie Vedder's track throughout the movie, this movie is enlightening as well as entertaining and a very important movie."
"I specifically signed up to review this film on IMDb because it really was THAT awful. Since I cannot re-gain those precious two hours of my life back, hopefully I can save the time of other souls who are thinking about watching this movie...In short, it is pretentious, hypocritical and painfully boring. The main character is so righteous and hypocritical, I found myself hating him more and more, wishing his demise would occur sooner rather than later. Why, then, does this movie have such a high rating on IMDb? Clearly too many feel that if Sean Penn directed it, well, they MUST like it. Or, simply because it is so slow and boring (and it tries too hard to be deep and meaningful), it must be a good movie.If you want something deep, meaningful, and life-affirming, yet fun and modern, go watch '127 Hours'."
"weenblow's comment is pretty representative of those who found this movie to be concerned with a solipsistic, naive, self indulgent adolescent ""I feel like I have been cheated. There was really nothing of much redeeming value to be found in this film. The character development did not help me to sympathize with the main character, he came off as a brash, uninformed idealist with no real intelligence."" My summary judgement is that a] the book is about spoiled rich brat in a long line of writers who have the luxury to criticise 'society' from the vantage of privilege b] the movie in representing this is bound to fail Please don't waste your time: it's an example of a 'cult' movie that feeds on its own self importance. Come back Thoreau, Rosseau, Beat Poets et al - all is forgiven. grrrrrrr 1 is too generous; please can IMDb provide a negative number scale as well? If so I'd give this minus 10"
"good photography. performances OK. mr penn continues displaying his backseat limo liberal fodder in idealizing a self indulgent solipsistic brat. so he gives away the money his family worked for to ,""feed somebody"".had he been truly sympathetic to the downtrodden he could have made better use of his time than to be playing vagabond (knowing ultimately that he had a place to go if necessary). to idealize this teenybopper unabomber is vulgar. no feelings of consequence for his action, only let's play some more because it's fun. no contribution to society, no recognition of the pain caused to the sister he supposedly ""loved"". this guy was by definition a sociopath. for a film to exalt this loser is a sad commentary on humanity. perhaps one day little sean will be able to progress beyond his adolescent ego, but that is doubtful."
"Read Walden instead. This sad exploration of one boy's stupidity in his quest for isolation left me wondering why everyone likes this movie so much. The pacing is slow. The reasons behind our hero's actions are not explained enough to make them believable. The ""interesting"" characters that he meets on his journey are mostly hollow shells of some ""meaningful"" stereotype.The cinematography was solid. The images of Alaska were stunning. The feeling of isolation was very real. I like deep, thoughtful films about life, meaning, and self discovery. This just was not one of them. Though it tried."
"A suffocating rat-race for power, prestige and money exists in modern society in which we all a part of, willingly or otherwise. We haven't got it in us to break free from them. This movie is a reflection of beauty for the way it has portayed a true winner. Someone who is adamant on living life on his own terms while appreciating the beauty of his own existence and everything beautiful around him. Sean Penn has delivered a masterpiece with his incredible direction. Honestly, this is one of the most uplifting, visually aesthetic and profoundly touching films I have ever seen. Standout performance by Emile Hirsch and pretty much the entire cast. The soundtrack by Eddie Vedder is top-notch. Cinematography at It's peak, once again. So I sincerely urge everyone to give this a go, if you haven't. This is a sublime experience which one can't exactly put to words but deeply relate to, anytime. These hitch hikers never stay rooted to one place. They come, they live, they leave. But this movie will stay with you forever for the impact it leaves on us is somewhat indelible."
"Very gripping, peculiar, important story of this generation about Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) who lives by his own rules not by the government and society's expectations. I respect his way of living more than most things, despite it being unhealthy & more bizarre than the norm.Purely genuine throughout, with beautiful cinematography and inspirational! Sean Penn wrote such an exquisite masterpiece, very much recommend."
