"on modern ""boats"" life isn't easy- but compared to the living hell that the German U-Boats were, modern submariners have nothing to complain about. People in certain professions don't like to watch movies about those professions (Doctors and Nurses shy away from hospital dramas, for example). Submarine sailors are different. We love to watch every submarine movie ever made, from ""Run Silent, Run Deep"" and ""Destination: Tokyo"" to ""The Hunt For Red October"", ""Crimson Tide"" and ""U-571"". Why? Because we can always use a good laugh. For those in the know, submarine movies are usually absolutely hilarious. Except this one. After being in the Navy for four years, serving with around 350 different men, and being acquainted with a further 200-300, all of them submarine sailors, I think that I can state with absolute certainty that this film is the ONLY submarine movie that ALL submariners take seriously. And that is the highest praise a movie like this can possibly get."
"Das Boot is not just a great war film: it's a great film period. Maybe it is true that epic themes make the greatest novels and films.  Here is a movie that explores heroism, duty, patriotism, hope, fear and the futility of war--all grand themes--explored in the confined, and collapsing, spaces of a German u-boat.I saw this film when I was a freshman in college during a weekend that I later dubbed my ""depressing movie festival."" (The Wall and Apocalypse Now were the other weekend ""entries."")  Of these films, it was Das Boot that haunted me--when I laid down at night, I saw Jurgen Proctow's pained blue eyes.  When I woke in the morning, I felt as if I were escaping through the hatch of the submarine.  I could not shake the images, and now some fifteen years later, I still remember how completely meaningless the movie made everything seem, and the nihilistic message stayed with me for a long, long time.  How few films are there which affect the viewers on this level.  To say this film is ""powerful"" seems so weak a description.Part of the ""power"" of the film comes, I think, from a certain restraint in the direction.  So often, films which aspire to move the audience quickly fall into melodrama, over-acting, and overblown images.  Too much.  These often succeed in the immediate response (usually crying) but fail to impact the viewer on anything more than a surface level.  Here, it is the small moments which fill the screen.  Everywhere, all around is War, but for these men as we witness them, war does not begin with a capital ""W"".  It is reality, not a grand concept.  The director lets the story shock and horrify the audience, not by forcing it, but by letting the story just tell itself. Drama, tension and resolution occur naturally in Das Boot, which contributes to the very real impact of the film.Story is a 10, direction is a 10, acting is a 10 and the cinematography is a 10.  One of the all-time greatest films."
"What impresses me the most about the film, as the title makes apparent, is that it's a German made film about a German U-boat. Patriotism for my own country would tend to make me hate the crew on this ship by definition (especially if portrayed as typical mindless killing machine Nazis), but these characters are so well developed and played like human-beings facing difficult decisions that I find myself sympathizing with these guys.I love the flow and pacing of the Director's Cut; it takes its time, and does not feel like typical Hollywood formula ""first major plot point at minute 12"" cookie-cutter routine. Das Boot gives us plenty of time to know these characters, discover how they kill time while waiting for orders, how they feel about their job and each other. Then when the action finally starts: how they deal with the possibility of dying deep underwater, how they react to the sounds of a sub going deeper than it should, the look on their faces as a destroyer is heard pinging them, and dozens of little personality quirks--subtle details that bring the crew to life. It truly does feel like an epic about a submarine crew, and I'm interested in some day viewing the 6 hour TV version.The underwater battles somewhat remind me of Sergio Leone in that Wolfgang Peterson takes forever and a day to get the fights started. Unlike Leone, once the torpedos are launched and the depth charges dropped, the cat-and-mouse game is ongoing and relentless, but never boring.And despite the fact that most of the film takes place inside a cramped submarine, Das Boot is never boring to look at; in fact, it's a visually spectacular film (given the dated special effects, who hold up reasonably well and add to the old-school charm). And the freedom of the camera in those tight corridors came as an incredibly pleasant surprise. The color and composition of the shots in those tight quarters -- particularly upon approaching the first destroyer when we get the first real glimpse of the interior prepped for war -- it is both haunting and beautiful.Jurgen Prochnow delivers the most believable performance of a ship captain I've ever seen on film. All the emotions register on his face--his concern for his own life, ship, and crew; his hatred for the decisions he's forced to make; the disbelieving joy of beating the overwhelming odds--while simultaneously holding it back so the crew sees a strong unmoving man forever in control of the situation. His performance is, in a word, brilliant.The rest of the cast also delivers amazingly believable performances, and trust me, I could write an entire review on the film's characters and their portrayals. It's both disappointing and satisfying that I'm not given enough space to do so (I wish I could state that about a tenth of the films I've reviewed here on IMDb.) I liked the entire crew of this U-boat, the war correspondent and his character arc as he realizes the truth behind these ""heroes"", the chief and his longing to return to his wife, Johann and the story of his redemption--all well cast, well acted, and believable.Another aspect I adored about Das Boot - the controversial scenes simply rolled by with no more or less emphasis than any other statement the film makes. In fact, I saw the film before really reading anything or researching it and found myself somewhat shocked to hear about these ""talked about"" scenes. Granted, the film does pose some moral questions, but I felt the film handled it with grace and great subtlety, showing what it needs to get the point across and not a step further . . . unlike typical Hollywood where controversy gets bold print, italics, and a highlighter. Maybe I should move to Germany.I can go on for a long while: Over three hours of wonderful visuals and strong performances, a sparse but great score (this film's lack of music is quite appropriate, making the presence of music much more impactful in its key places). Realistic writing from people who lived the experience first hand. As I said, I can go on for awhile but I'll sum it up and end this review with one statement: Das Boot is the definitive submarine movie."
"I spent 17 years of my life in Royal Navy submarines. 'T' class, 'A' class and 'R' class. Das Boot is the only submarine movie that shows exactly how it was. It could be a documentary. Bouncing around in the Bay of Biscay with the sea too rough to be able to dive safely and get away from it. 'Goffers' pouring down the conning tower and the control room deck ankle deep in the green stuff. Going down backwards at 500ft and you know there is 10,000ft below you, with seawater pouring in through a burst cooling pipe and one main motor out of action. Existing for two weeks on kai or oxo because your stomach is rebelling against the elements. Laying in your bunk in ultra quiet routine with the sweat just dribbling down. When the sweat starts to dribble upwards you know it's a cockroach crawling up your body. And that Klaxon. 'Hunt for Red October', 'Crimson Tide'. They are just adventure films."
"While it has been a very long time since I have seen this movie, it is one of the very few that I own. Wolfgang Petersen's magnificent accomplishment in ""Das Boot"" is reiterating the dictum that ""war is hell"", no matter which side you look at it from and no matter where the battlefield is located.*** Minor spoilers ***The plot has been well described by other viewers so I won't rehash it again. But my personal observations, as an ex-submarine sailor, are that Petersen probably portrayed life on board the sub pretty accurately. I say ""probably"" because todays subs are hotels compared with the German U-boats and American submarines. The commonality between yesterday and today is how the crew deals with being closed up in a ""sewer pipe"" for weeks at a time. More importantly, you as a viewer become an invisible crew member as the crew lives in very cramped conditions (American WW2 subs used to be called ""pig boats""), deals with an unfortunately believable political officer, deals with drills, actual torpedo firings, actual ships casualties, and deals, most frighteningly, with retribution from the ""enemy"". My own experience watching the depth charging of the U-boat was such that I was thinking ""stop it, Stop It, STOP IT, STOPITSTOPITSTOPIT...!!!!!"" That's how real it felt to me. For the rest of you, I feel certain you will too be dragged in and know what it is like to live on board a WW2 U-boat.This movie also shows how leadership is so important in keeping the crew (and ultimately the sub) together. Petersen's direction for Captain Lehmann-Willenbrock was masterful because it didn't portray the captain as a god. It showed him as a man who knows how to lead, knows his submarine as if he were married to it (and in many ways he is) but isn't perfect at the job. It also shows that even with great leadership qualities, Captain Lehmann-Willenbrock can not do the job alone: he must have both officers and enlisted men who have the knowledge and skill to not just do their jobs, but to also advise the captain. Petersen also managed to give each member of the crew their own separate personalities instead of the predictable cookie-cutter personalities that Hollywood feels is needed.I could go on and on. So I will close by saying that with the plot, direction, cinematography, acting, sound, music, editing all being top notch, this is one of the few movies that I can truly rate a 10 out of 10. I also preferred the German version with subtitles.------------------------------------ I believe that this movie was either the first or one of the first to use Steadicam technology. It was truly amazing for me to see a camera zip its way through a submarine, specifically through the open watertight doors, without a break in the filming. Up until I heard what Steadicam was, I was always wondering how Petersen managed to hide the camera dolly track or the wires the camera hung from.(It turns out I was wrong: ""Bound For Glory"" was the first.)EDIT (12 OCT, 2006): I have been corrected by an observant viewer. Wikipedia has the following comment on what I thought was Steadicam usage:""Most of the interior shots were filmed using a hand-held Arriflex of cinematographer Jost Vacano's design to convey the claustrophobic atmosphere of the boat. It had a gyroscope to provide stability, a reinvention of the Steadicam on a smaller scale, so that it could be carried throughout the interior of the mock-up. Vacano wore full-body padding to minimize injury as he ran and the mock-up was rocked and shaken."" So, literally, a Steadicam was NOT used in the filming of ""Das Boot"". However, a camera that resembled Steadicam in function (in the way it gyroscopically leveled the filming platform) was used.------------------------------------ Even though todays submarines are far cleaner then their predecessors, and we have refrigerators, freezers, air conditioning, are able to take showers, etc., there is one aspect of living in an enclosed space that still lives on: the smell. While the smell of the ""pig boats"" of WW2 was truly atrocious, even with todays ability to clean the atmosphere, you can not escape the fact that any smell that is created, from burned toast in the galley, from the smell of the ""sanitary gasses"" (to be kind), to gasified hydraulic oil and diesel fuel, all these particulates will eventually become absorbed in your clothing. You, as a sailor, may get used to it, but when you get home, your wife will most likely declare that you smell like a submarine and demand that whatever you are wearing get thrown in the wash ... immediately!"
"""Das Boot"" is a classic. This film couldn't be more intense and emotionally draining. It is a work of genius. Jurgen Prochnaw gives a spectacular performance as the German U-Boat Captain. The acting is first rate as the cast of characters is as realistic and believable as it gets. Don't watch this film unless you are absolutely prepared to immerse yourself into the drama of life as a crewman aboard a German submarine during war. This is a very rare portrayal of battle through the eyes of our enemy and will actually have you cheering for the ""bad guys"" at times. This is a one of a kind movie that must be seen to be believed. Words in a review cannot describe the experience of ""Das Boot."" A tremendous film! A 12 on a scale of 10!"
"Das Boot is one of the most emotionally involving movies I have ever seen. The characters are developed richly, without those awkward moments in movies when you realize that the director is doing so.  You sympathize with the crew, and FEEL their plight as they struggle, cramped in a rickety U-boat against the odds.  At times the movie grows slow and drawn out, but that is intentional- to make you feel like you are trapped in an underwater coffin with nothing to do, no where to go.  The directing is great, the sound is fabulous!  I've never heard faint noises tell a story like this before."
"The first time I saw this film I could not take my eyes from it. I was mesmerized with the transition of a hearty young crew leaving port evolving as the sheer moments of terror (deep under water battles and personal struggles as well as the final scene) lead them all to rethink their actual cause, and their very own mortality (as well as our own in the perils of war!). I can't imagine another film actually displaying what it must have been like to be on one of Nazi Germany's U-boats - young nationalist boys being plucked from their mother's bosom and cast into the claustrophobic iron wolfs in the heat and height of the second world war, who begin to doubt the cause and victory of the fuhrer they've been taught to love and trust. Very colorful, contrasting characters and a script and plot thick with surprises and emotional drama/trauma. Top-notch direction, action, acting and sets. This is perhaps the greatest movie ever made in my opinion. Sorry I couldn't be more specific with the review, there is just too much to cover without spoiling anything for those yet to enjoy it, and thus I just highly recommend it to anybody, not just war movie buffs. I have seen both the regular version and the director's cut (which I own on DVD now) and I must say that the DC is superior. A masterpiece!"
"I first saw this film on the BBC when it was aired in it's mini series format. I was 13 at the time and was totally blown away by it. Up until then, the only war films i had seen were gung-ho movies, with GI's firing tommy guns from the hip at hoardes of evil Nazis. To see a film that showed 'the enemy' as human beings, with hopes, fears and dreams was something else to a 13 yr old kid. As i grew up i began to understand more about the second world war and was able to make up my own mind as to whether the 'evil Nazis' were all that the cinema portrayed them to be, but 'Das Boot' always stuck at the back of my mind as an outstanding example of how to show fighting men, from what ever side, in the best possible way.Lots of people rave about 'Saving Private Ryan' being the ultimate WW2 film. Although good, it isn't a patch on Das Boot. The Boat has everything; Fine actors, an excellent script (which doesn't deviate from the Novel at all) and excellent hand-held camera work, supported by brilliant lighting, and 20 years before 'Private Ryan' too!Das Boot is an excellent example of how to depict the horrors of war without resorting to a blood and gore fest and it remains a film that everyone should see it it's entirity at least once."
"One of the few movies that shows the war from a German perspective (the more recent ""Downfall"" is also unmissable) and makes for compelling viewing. You identify with the despair, the youngsters' need to ""go home"", the loves left behind, the fear of dying, the dawning enormity of their action as they recede from the survivors in the sea, the sheer fatigue of continuing when every nerve yearns to be free of the boat's confines - the pressures of war, and marvel at the courageous human will that keeps defying all odds and surviving.I found myself on edge for the entire movie, feeling as trapped inside the sub as the crew and even cheering as the boat surfaced in the end against all odds and then, mourning the futility of it all. The movie succeeds in showing the war as a very human tragedy, forcing us to not hide behind anonymous ""enemy"" tags. Among many tragic moments, especially poignant is the scene where the captain recants the incident of watching the survivors cry for help. You can almost see his eyes glistening. Almost.The cast is superb but the captain is outstanding, his eyes brilliantly essaying his emotions.Best version is the director's cut in the original German with English subtitles.What I don't understand is why Das Boot never won any Oscars. Can anyone shed light on this? Was it a political decision? (Btw, I think Saving Private Ryan is highly over-rated as an all-time great war movie)."
"Using the term 'authenticity' in connection with any kind of art is rather difficult and daring as well. Sometimes it looks posed or is by certain purposes manipulated. Referring to Petersen´s ""Das Boot"" however, I consider it justified to call it authentic and true. I think this statement can be strengthened mainly by the fact that Lothar Gunther Buchheim was consulted. He composed the novel this breathtaking movie bases on and he himself was employed as a war correspondent in the Second World War.The entire plot has no weak points. Starting at ""Bar Royal"" at the very night before the forces living journey of the submarine crew begins, the director fittingly manages to confront the audience with the protagonists and their way of dealing with the pounding uncertainty. Once put to sea, the character of the scenes changes abruptly. Every member of the crew and the audience as well comes into very close contact with the tightness of the action space. At this point it is necessary to underline the excellent work of the cameramen. The fast and partial hectic cuts draw an exact picture of the drama on board. Too do not forget the outstanding lighting. However besides this abundance of obvious suspense, there are also a number of moments going into in-depth psychology and thoughtfulness. To outline only a few of them: At ""Bar Royal"", when the chief engineer reflects about the uncertain fate of his family, or when the captain, with a kind of 'Weltschmerz' in his eyes, is astound and proud of the unbelievable efforts of the crew. It would probably be too laborious to refer to the decisive symbols the director uses, therefore I recommend this movie to everybody, especially those who are interested in the Second World War.It presumably sounds pretty weird, yet I suppose that mankind gladly participates on the misfortune of others, without being closely involved with it. This closing notion may account for the huge success of this movie.>"
"War movies have been biases to one side or the other. This movie does not make hero's or enemies of the German U-boat sailors. Instead, it grips the viewer with realistic depictions of what it was like to be a U-boat sailor for the Gemans in WWII. It starts off with young (17 year old to 25 year old) who have been filled with propaganda about the war effort and glorious battle. After this young crew of immature sailors start to experience the true horrors of war, you can not only see, but experience with them the boredom, laughter, camaraderie, team work and death. In a world where you have no windows, where your ears have to be your eyes, where a cat and mouse game is played and the looser dies, these young men age 10 to 15 years It makes the viewer realize the horror of submarine warfare in WWII. The most realistic war movie I have ever seen."
"If you've never seen this movie then beg, borrow or steal a copy. It'll actually make you admire/feel sympathy for the German Serviceman caught up, in what was the most horrific of wars. Tense, realistic and gripping this one off has yet to be bettered in my opinion. The start doesn't really remind you of a war movie but believe me thats armed forces behaviour all right. As WW2 progressed Hitler drew on ever younger recruits and the historical accuracies are in abundance for a change. This film makes modern junk like the new Pearl harbour look limp wristed.As shocking as the statistics are (30000 out of 40000 never returned) It makes you wonder why so many young men volunteered for the Untersee boot 'Kreigsmarine'. Pride and patriotism counts for everything. Its a 10 out of 10 for me.Don't take my word for it. Watch it."
"In October 1941, the German Capt.-Lt. Henrich Lehmann-Willenbrock (Jürgen Prochnow) of the U-96 U-Boat receives the war correspondent Lt. Werner (Herbert Grönemeyer) to cover the work in the submarine during their mission in the Atlantic Ocean. They sail out of the shipyard La Rochelle and along the next weeks, Werner learns the lives, loves, fear and behavior of the young crew, the veteran Captain and his officers. The skilled captain hunts British vessels to sink and dives to depths below the limit of the boat to escape from the destroyers. Near Christmas, they plan to return to La Rochelle; but out of the blue, Captain Henrich receives an order to cross the Strait of Gibraltar to go to Italy. But the captain knows how protected the area is and plans a means to lure the British Navy. Will the U-96 succeed in crossing the Strait of Gibraltar?""Das Boot"" is a German masterpiece by Wolfgang Petersen with 2h 29 min. The ""Superbit"" director's cut on DVD with one additional hour is a supreme masterpiece of a war (or anti-war) film. It is impressive how a 3h 29 min film is never boring, keeping the viewer on the edge of his or her seat until the very ending. The claustrophobic and tense story increases the drama and the character development in this version, becoming one of the best movies in the cinema history. The German captain, officers and crew are not shown as one-dimension character or sad killing machine like in many war films, but as human beings with families and friends, very efficient in their works but with fear and other feelings. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""O Barco: Inferno no Mar"" (""The Boat: Hell in the Sea"")"
"I come from a family of submariners. My grandfather commanded a sub in the Pacific during WW2, and my dad went on to do nearly 30 years as crew and finally skipper in a nuke hunter/killer. So I kinda know the history of subs 1st hand. This movie pulls no punches and is stunningly accurate. It is a work of genius from one of the greatest directors of our time.I must qualify that by saying PLEASE don't watch the dubbed English version. This film has to be seen in German with subtitles, and you absolutely have to see the director's cut. Three and a half hours of laughter, terror, claustrophobia, tenderness, and finally a sense of the futility of war. It's just brilliant.Jürgen Prochnow has made some good films in his career, but he will never better this performance. He is the epitome of a sub captain. Steely, yet sensitive to his crew. Determined and sometimes rash, but always in control, and the love of his crew for him is clear throughout. Even I would follow him until the end!!I kinda feel bad about praising Jürgen Prochnow so highly because, seriously, this is one of the few movies I've seen where EVERY member of the cast is just perfect. All credit to the casting people. You would not change anyone. Bernd Tauber as the Chief is just awesome. Erwin Leder as Johann is just so right, and Herbert Grönemeyer as the raw reporter who grows up is amazing.This film should be up there with the greatest war movies of all time. Unfortunately, I think because it's told from the German side, it will never get the recognition it truly deserves. Very sad, as it never glorifies Nazism. It's simply a tale of ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances - which kinda sums up all wars.Incredible film from an incredible director."
"In the entire history of cinema, there have only been two perfect war movies: Apocalypse Now, and Das Boot. I watched Apocalypse Now /Redux several years ago, and yesterday I finished the 3.5-hour Director's Cut of Das Boot.The submarine subgenre goes all the way back to 1915's The Secret of the Submarine, and has not improved much since then. Sweden gave it the old college try in 1952 with Ubåt 39, but nobody's quite sure if this is a good submarine movie or not because it has only ever been seen by the Swedes, who refuse to discuss it.1958 brought us Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster in Run Silent, Run Deep, which Americans thought was fantastic, and pretty much everyone else thought was 'meh' because it deviated so wildly from the plot of the book.The big ones that most people remember are The Hunt for Red October (1990) by Tom 'I-Never-Met-An-Offensive-Stereotype-I-Didn't-Like' Clancy, and Crimson Tide (1995) by Richard 'P' Henrick. These formulaic Cold War paranoia flicks were acceptable for the time, but their clunky plots and simmering racial tensions have not aged well.Enter Das Boot.Wolfgang Petersen's 1981 WWII classic has gone down in history as the greatest submarine film ever made, and is unlikely to be surpassed. Starring Jürgen Prochnow as Kapitänleutnant Henrich Lehmann-Willenbrock, Herbert Grönemeyer as Leutnant Werner, and Klaus Wennemann as Leitender Ingenieur Fritz Grade, this exceptional film is in a league of its own.Filmed entirely with practical special effects using an advanced custom made hand-held Arriflex camera with proto-Steadicam technology, Das Boot took two years to make, and was finally cut from over 330,000 metres of exposed film.With a budget of 32 million Deutsche Marks, it was the second most expensive German film the world had ever seen (beaten only by Metropolis) and remains one of the most expensive today.The genius of Das Boot is its timelessness. Even today there is almost nothing in the film that looks dated, though the colour saturation is a little weak by current standards. The cinematography is astonishingly good, particularly considering the conditions under which Das Boot was shot.The performances are superlative. Prochnow is the standout, but Grönemeyer and Wennemann are not far behind. Erwin Leder deserves a special mention as Obermaschinist Johann, whose steadily deteriorating mental state is a masterclass of method acting.Above all, it is the gritty realism of Das Boot that captivates audiences and keeps the movie fresh. The crew grow beards over time; their faces become drawn and haggard; their eyes become sunken and bloodshot; their clothes become dirty, and remain so.The longer you watch, the more it draws you in. After the first 30 minutes you can already feel the damp heat, smell the stink of diesel, and sense the flexing of metal plates as the U-boat approaches crush depth.There is not a single wasted minute in this film, which (like all the best war movies) is stridently anti-war.I rate Das Boot at 33.3 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as an unbeatable 10/10 on IMDb."
"Never has nothing happening been such compelling viewing.No debate, no discussion, no contenders - DAS BOOT is THE submarine movie for the ages.In autumn 1941, World War II U-Boat 96, crewed by young rowdy Germans, puts to sea with its veteran captain, wildly Teutonic Jürgen Prochnow, his eyes the color of eagle and high cheekbones set on stun.The battle for control of the Atlantic is turning against the Germans, yet Hitler orders more and more U-boats with ever younger crews into battle against the British freighters and their destroyer escorts. This opening pitch and the antsiness of Jürgen's young hooligan crew seems to presage a roaring Hitlercoaster of war war war Amerikan style - but director/co-writer Wolfgang Petersen and writers Lothar G. Buchheim and Dean Riesner swerve to port with a counter intuitive yet singularly entertaining and tension-filled, character-driven non-action action movie. These young punks discover that being at war is much like the waiting room in any doctor's office.DAS BOOT is filled with periods of waiting in fear, waiting in boredom, waiting in terror, waiting in anxiety - and sudden action that rips throats and bends steel with its bare hands.DAS BOOT does something which most commercial war films are too gutless to do - humanizes Germans: they carry photos of their girls, they write home, there are heroes and cowards, there are hard men and those that crack under the strain; they catch crabs and rib each other about it; at one point, a sailor stops a celebration with the announcement of bad news on the radio - into the silence, he declares that back home, their team has lost! These men doubt much of the war propaganda they are fed. Even though German tacticians convey Churchill as a ""paralyzed guzzler"" the officers on U-96 respect the British fleet (""Those aren't amateurs up there""). Yet they do not fear the British simply because that is the default position of Germans in Westernized film, but because the British had better equipment. These Germans are not one-dimensional haters, not committed blindly to the Führer, not simple villain props as in countless Brit and U.S. movies. They are the heroes. And our hearts are with theirs in their throats every watery step of the way.Even in its shortest version, DAS BOOT is 2 hours, 29 minutes. The Director's Cut is 209 minutes, the uncut version is 293 minutes (4 hrs, 53 mins). It's the most fun you'll have growing a five o'clock shadow.DAS BOOT attains such a high level of drama, we forgive Wolfgang Petersen for the subpar exteriors, with those model subs and little dolls on the tower being foamed in slow motion to emulate a sizable u-boat.When most movies are ending - at the 1:33 mark - this movie sees its first action. Yet even the action is not what one expects: after U-96 fires torpedoes at a British convoy, they submerge and wait in silence, listening for the muffled far-off explosions and counting the British ships sinking by the groans of steel they hear through the depths. And they know they're in for repercussions - depth charges. The waiting begins anew - the interminable, unbearable waiting for death to claim you or not - as they ""run silent,"" all lights out, submerging further, engines at minimum. The sound of sonar pings their only warning that something is closing on them from above. The Captain says into the silence, ""Here it comes. The revenge."" And all they can do is hang on through the bucking explosions and bolts bursting on pressurized pipes.After the terror subsides, Prochnow simply declares, ""That's the end of that."" Not heroes. Not cowards. Just doing their job.When U-96 surfaces to survey their kills, they are outraged to find that one of the flaming ships they torpedoed still has men onboard, jumping off, screaming, aflame. And the focus of the Captain's outrage will surprise you: ""Why weren't they rescued after all these hours?"" One of his officers begins to weep for the dying. It's a wondrous portrayal of war empathy, of humanity. It makes us question war yet again, and question the supposed intelligence of the species that can create the marvel of submarines and battleships only to use them in such unproductive, moronic fashion against each other.Imagine the frustration of knowing that on a submarine, humans are the least important cargo - literally stacks of torpedoes, spare parts, tools for repairs (it's like being in space - there is nowhere you can turn if you need a certain part), food, fuel, ballast, the mechanics of the sub itself, and at the very bottom of the list - as evidenced by the way sleeping bunks are haphazardly squeezed into crawlspaces - people.Director Petersen instructed the whole crew not to go out into the sun during filming, so they would retain that bloodless pallor. He effectively suffocates us in the ghastly, claustrophobic passageways and ""living spaces"" of a submarine; he sends his cameras barreling through crawlspaces full tilt, pursuing running men who trip and glide through hatches; we almost feel the cracking of our skulls on jutting iron overhangs; sea water thunders in every time the top hatch is opened, drenching the plastic-coated charts and everyone nearby; everything is wet and damp, dark and cold...DAS BOOT is a gritty study in patience, tactics, anxiety, tolerance, futility, and brings a whole new meaning to wetting the bed."
"I've decided not to review the 1981 dubbed cinematic release of DAS BOOT . Instead I've decided to review Wolfgang Petersen's director's cut which is far closer to the miniseries version which most readers will be familiar with When someone makes an anti war statement it's important that they differentiate between being "" anti war "" and "" anti military "" . The Brits don't seem to know the difference and seem keen to make anti- military / anti - soldier self loathing war movies with Paul Greengrass's RESURRECTED a good example . Having suffered the tragedy of Vietnam the Americans finally made anti- war movies that were a million miles removed from the old John Wayne and Errol Flynn star vehicles where a man wipes out 30 enemy soldiers single handed without suffering a scratch . But when it comes to making anti - war movies that shows the horrors of war and the courage of men in battle the Germans are top of the league , heads and shoulders above everyone else . This is because present day Germans realize that the enemy isn't the other side - it's war itself that's the enemy and DAS BOOT is a great example of this thinking The story starts slowly by introducing us to the crew via the war correspondent who are celebrating a last night ashore before they sail on their mission to sink British convoys sailing from America to Britain carrying vital supplies for the war effort against Nazi Germany . This is where DAS BOOT is superb , I really felt empathy for these crew man . Okay I didn't want them sinking British ships but I didn't want them to die either an opinion that shouldn't be taken lightly since my paternal grandfather was a merchant seaman during the war while my maternal grandfather was a crewman on a destroyer . The fact the crew of U-96 are presented as being utterly human and for this Brit hoping they make it home in one piece is a great achievement DAS BOOT was nominated for several Oscars and it's not difficult to see why. Watch it on widescreen television with stereo surround and you'll be amazed with the very clear sound effects and sound editing . Perhaps the best technical aspect is the cinematography where during moments of crisis the camera shoots along the length of the U- boat as it follows crewmen rushing about . When a foreign language movie is nominated for several Oscars you just know it's good!!!!! SLIGHT SPOILERS !!!!This is a superb movie but it's not perfect . Being a German movie Nazis feature at one point but none of them are crew members , the only Nazis featured are the crew of a supply ship who have who have never seen a days fighting in their lives . It's understandable for German film makers to play down the courage of Nazi party members of the Second World War but it should also be remembered that the Waffan SS were exclusively composed of party members and they were the most feared fighting force of the conflict . CROSS OF IRON ( My favourite movie featuring WW 2 ) does make the valid point that because someone isn't a fan of the Nazis it doesn't necessarily make them a good person either . The screenplay also drags due to the fact that there's two subplots of U-96 being damaged and stuck on the Atlantic seabed when one subplot of sinking and then resurrecting the vessel would have sufficedBut the pros far outweigh the cons and I recommend this movie to people who have never seen a foreign language film in their life . It's placing in the IMDb top 250 is well earned . You may be shocked to know that director Wolgang Petersen later went onto to make Hollywood crap like OUTBREAK and A PERFECT STORM"
"Thats right, not even saving private Ryan comes close, this film is a masterpiece! from beginning to end, non-stop action and suspense, never a dull moment!, it has these nail-biting scenes and moments like when the depth charges blow and the UDS (ultrasonic detection system) sounds, just chilling and gut-wrenching! and the scene where the chief is sharing his pictures of him and his wife are heart-warming, simply beautiful a 10 out of 10 rating,the soundtrack is also amazing, so beautiful I even bought the CD, this is a real WWII movie!, my hats of to Wolfgang Petersen!!!.A must see WWII film!"
"What can be said about this epic that has not already been said? Peterson has created the grittiest, most realistic war drama ever. It knocks hollywood epics like Saving Private Ryan on their sorry overproduced, oversentimental behinds, it torpedoes other submarine films before they have a chance to shout ""dive!, dive!, dive!"".I first saw this in its original form as a miniseries with english subtitles, and if you can find this version then this should be your first port of call, although the Director's cut I now own is also top notch and doesn't miss much from the series.where to begin? The lurking claustrophobia, the dark humour, the gritty reality of the piece. The excellent acting, the perfect timing, the garotte of suspense tightened with every passing minute in much of the undersea scenes. The lack of any known ""star"" who you know will just save the day and live to tell the tale. The historical accuracy and attention to detail. The lack of a demonised ""other"" figure for the enemy. The lack of any kind of preachy message in the finale other than ""War is Hell"". It has everything you could ask of a TV series or film about the era. 10 out of 10."
"10/10.8/10 for the cut version.This is a superior war film, and I don't want to add to the reviews praising it. It's one of those films that will make you watch if only you can spare the ten minutes it takes for it to grip you.Being British, I thought it impossible to feel sorry for the U-boat crews, especially after what they did to us - but this film forces you to realise that we are all fragile and emotional (despite what Hitler says).I would recommend people watch the mini-s rather than the film (i.e. German subtitled version) to get the full flavor.As a side note, my grandfather (twice decorated destroyer captain) burst in to tears watching this at two points: One was at Gibralta, the other on the straights :| Says a lot."
"After watching Das Boot for the first time, I have to say that not only was I pleased, I was completely in awe of it! Knowing the Oscar nominations it received, I was only disappointed that the whole cast didn't win one. One lone actor cannot take all of the credit for such an incredible force portrayed by all the men on the ship. Jurgen Prochnow played the part of the captain better than any other actor has ever played the role of a leader of men. He brought to life the drama of leading a group of young men into a possible suicide mission with utter realism and depth. I don't normally get emotional at movies anymore. I did watching this one! All the other actors deserve as much credit for the very different men they portrayed. Not one of them was bad. Wolfgang Petersen is an amazing storyteller, and this movie proved it. I would have to say that it might very well be the best war movie I have seen, heck, it may be the best movie I have seen period!!!"
"I am not a fan of war movies. I find that war movies, especially American ones, glorify war and portray those who fight as 'heroes'. The typical war movie simplifies war to a struggle between good and evil, though real war is so much more complex. Das Boot is nothing like the typical war movie. It shows World War II for how it was: horrifying, ruthless, and ill-planned. The U-boat crew are ordinary guys, with lives back home in Germany which they long to return to. They are not heroes, they are men who are afraid and are in the line of duty out of self-preservation and patriotism, not because they are psychotic Nazis. (they're not.) It is a story far more complex that good and evil, it is about human decisions and mistakes, and the complex struggle between one's loyalties and one's nature. Watching Das Boot, you forget that the crew is German, which in Western society we are taught is the 'bad team' of WWII, and see them for what they really were: ordinary men. I loved this movie, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to see a film that's really about something, without the warm-fuzzies and Hollywood conventions steeped into most movies. It is gripping and consuming, and once you see Das Boot, you're not likely to forget it."
When you go to a liquor store to buy Vodka you can purchase one of several brands or you can purchase Stoli. That's what Das Boot is when it comes to Submarine films. You can watch any one of several or you can watch Das Boot. Like Stoli Vodka it's in a class by itself. Superb film either way you see it i.e. subtitles or the dubbed version. See the directors cut if you can. The German crew could be any nationality the film is so well done it doesn't matter. Andy Rooney once said that when you're in a war you live life at 100%. The opening scene of this film demonstrates that. The men are living life at 100%. I never saw any other war movie that captured that like Das Boot.
"This is an amazing achievement, and it's obvious because it is one of the only German language films to receive widespread distribution in American theaters since the silent era. It was just that good! When it came to America, the movie was cut down a little from it's original HUGE length and it was released in both dubbed and subtitled versions.The film is about a single WWII German U-boat and it follows it through a very hazardous mission until it eventually makes it back to port. While this may not sound very interesting, it certainly is, as the movie is less a traditional movie but an experience meant to instill in the audience the daily life and horror of serving on one of these submarines. For example, when the sub is being pursued, you find yourself tense, on edge and feeling the claustrophobia of the crewmen. Viscerally, it is an amazing film and remains a true and faithful film--the crew is extraordinary but they are hardly romanticized--they are just men doing their best to stay alive! To top all this off, when the movie concludes, there is the most fitting and inspired ending I have seen in a war film. Like anything you've seen from Hollywood? No way--this is like real life in all its starkness and terror."
"If I had the time to take this movie door-to-door and sit down with everyone in America to watch this film, I would. Everyone needs to realize that I have a fascination with submarine films. I loved The Hunt for Red October and Crimson Tide. Both of them rank as my top action films. I don't know why I love this genre so much. I think it has to do somewhat with my passion for sci-fi. The ocean is almost like fighting in another world. So many times we have seen wars play out on land, and while there is only so much you can show with a land fight, the war field on the open sea allows for so much more creativity. Director Wolfgang Peterson gives us some great characters. While not much dialogue happens in this film, you can see everyone's expressions on their faces, and those expressions tell better stories than words. You can see their fear, their excitement, their sadness, and their power by just the way that Peterson directs them. With his direction, I felt that I was on this U-Boat with the crew. Peterson perfectly portrays a feeling of crampness and claustrophobia wrapped together as one. I think that during one of the bombing scenes I broke a sweat because of what was happening on screen. Finally, I am also a fan of films that tell a different angle on the story. So many years I have watched war movie after war movie that show the victorious American's beating the classic ""evil-doers"". Now don't get me wrong, these are fun sometimes, but I love to see a different angle. In history class we didn't learn about the casualties of the Germans in WWII. We learn about them as a statistic, and never put these heroes on a human level. This film humanizes the German's conditions during the war. The Germans are human being also, who fought for their country just as valiantly as our soldiers did during WWII. They had families, they had pasts, they had homes that they left to become a part of history. To fight for your beliefs. That is what America teaches us, fight for what we believe in....doesn't it? I could talk about this for hours, but instead I am going to sit back, relax, and tell you how wonderful Das Boot was to watch. I have not been this entertained for a long time. Bravo to everyone involved in this film. I think it IS the best war film ever released (that I have seen). I want everyone to get out of their seats this weekend and go rent this movie. I guarantee that you will not be disappointed. Grade: ***** out of *****"
"There are very few moments that I have this feeling and I got that feeling when I watched this for the first time today. Lord of the Rings, The Matrix, 2001: A Space Odyssey and a few others I get that same feeling from. Being a Brit I never thought I would be willing the Germans on, but this film is so intense and gripping that it had me on the edge of my seat the whole way through. The music, the acting and the script are all done to my full satisfaction. Its made like no other submarine movie I have ever seen. I've never done a review for a film before but I thought this film deserved it. I put this on my top 10 of greatest films of all time, if not top 5. If you can, watch the directors cut."
"My two uncles where submariners in the 2nd WW. Both survived, and I had the opportunity to meet the one that was a commander. Although he would not talk much about his experiences, I was able to extract from him his opinion of the TV Mini-Series when it came out. With the exception of the noise levels that crew members made in the movie (for drama purposes) he told me that it was a very faithful depiction of the life and hardships a submariner lived on a U-Boot.I personally have always admired the film because it depicts war without glorifying any of the participants. You are not guided by the director or the plot to identify with any particular character - you can actually relate to many of them, and therefor immerse yourself in the claustrophobic experience they live.Its an excellent piece of film making that combines drama and action into a very powerful anti-war message. Although I personally prefer the original mini-series, the directors cut with its remastered sound is also a great experience."
"This is a review of the DVD version of the 1997 ""Das Boot - The Director's Cut"".I remember, in 1981, when this movie came out and received so much acclaim. I didn't see it, mostly because it didn't sound very interesting, and I didn't like watching sub-tilted movies.I still would not have watched it if my neighbor hadn't brought over his DVD and said, ""you have to watch this.""I was overwhelmed.  It is one of the very finest movies I have ever seen (I'm in my 50s), maybe even the very best!  Yes, it is about war.  Set in 1941, it is about the German U-boat fleet.  A statistic shown at the beginning says ""40,000 German men were sent out on U-boats and 30,000 never returned."" This movie is about one of those U-boats, its battles, and the lives of its crew. Two-thirds into the movie the captain says, ""You have to have good men.  Good men, all of them.""  And that's really what this movie is all about. Even though it is almost 3 1/2 hours long, it never becomes dull or boring. Even if you don't like ""war"" movies. It is based on actual events, and will probably make you want to never serve on a submarine! I watched half on successive nights.This DVD is the ""Director's Cut"" which is (we are told in the extra features) almost like a new movie.  All sound tracks were digitally remastered. Scenes were totally re-edited and 60 minutes total were added. New ""foley"" editing was done to provide 8 tracks of sound (down to 6 on the Dolby Digital 5.1 on the DVD).  And, of course, it has both German and English language dialog tracks.  All the main characters came back to work on this movie to dub in their own voices in English, so they look and sound authentic.  You forget very quickly that it is a dubbed version.And the sound!  You'd better have a super subwoofer, because the dynamic range of sound is amazing. Explosions are the most realistic sounding I've heard on a home theater system. And the perfect surround sound balancing makes it seem like you are really in the submarine.Do yourself a big favor - see the new release of ""Das Boot"" if you haven't already."
"I've seen a fair number of war movies, but none can come close to ""Das Boot."" I saw it first in theaters when it was first released, in German with subtitles (great); saw it again in theaters, dubbed in English (awful); and then just saw it on the DVD director's cut with subtitles (excellent). The last was definitely the best.No war movie has ever captured the reality of the soldier's experience like this one. It's a submarine movie, so of course you're going to get the stock scenes of destroyers on the surface, tense men listening to the sonar ping, depth charges, diving deeper and deeper, etc. But it is so much more convincing in this movie than in any other in its genre (""Run Silent, Run Deep"" and ""The Enemy Below"" come to mind).But don't expect non-stop wall-to-wall action; the realism of the movie comes through in depicting the long periods of time when there was nothing to do: cruising through stormy seas, wandering about with no particular task or mission, the frustrations of the crew after weeks of inaction, etc. As a movie, this presents a problem because the viewer is taken through all that time in somewhat realistic fashion, which in turn makes the film long and not quite as gripping.The real punch of the movie, though, are the characters, their life on board, their hopes for a successful cruise and a return to normalcy. The actors do a fantastic job, all of them, but the captain and the chief engineer are probably the best, along with the journalist on board. The best scene, one which I remembered clearly ever since I first saw it in 1981, was the one where the sub crew goes on board the supply ship at Christmas time; the stark contrast between these rough, slimy, smelly crewmen and the polished, uniform-clad, hair combed and slicked officers on the supply ship, was just phenomenal. To think that some men went through the war in hell like the submariners, while others basically lived like kings, is just too painful to really comprehend.The ending is very creative, very surprising, and emotionally devastating. After seeing Das Boot, I can't ever bring myself to watch any other submarine movie.I give it 9.5/10 stars; just barely on the edge of a perfect 10, but not quite."
"Das Boot (The Boat) is film-making at its finest. Not only is this the greatest naval film, it is one of the finest statements on war ever filmed.Jurgen Prochnow is the excellent lead as the Captain of a U-Boat faced with impossible odds. A compassionate man, he is a veteran at the age of 30. His performance really ties the film together and gives it a strong human touch.The tension in this film reminded me of Clouzot's Wages of Fear (especially the last 45 minutes). This is a deeply impacting film because the audience really feels the claustrophobia, the filth, the tension and all the other emotions that the 42 crew members of the U-Boat go through.The sentiments of Das Boot are decidedly anti-war. By showing that it consists of bureaucratic senselessness, German officers living in a fantasy world, the despair of the fighting men - it makes for a touching tale.The director's cut is the version to be seen although it is long. Each scene of the movie is a classic and will show you the realities of war."
This film is an absolute piece of art. Unlike so many war films it does not make heros of one side and villains of the other instead it focuses on the the emotions of the crew and how each one goes from being exhilarated in one moment to terrified in the next. The acting is absolutely first class the characters totally believable and although u do not get to completely identify each of them you really do start to imagine what life on board a WWII u-boat in the latter part of the war must have been like. The sense of fear and anxiety is their for u 2 see in the eyes of these sailors whose faces are covered with a mix of sweat and oil The absolute horror on their faces when they test the sub to depths beyond that of the original trials: just gripping! For me at least this is definitely one of the most realistic war-films ever and also probably the best.
"This is touted as one of the best WWII submarine films of all time, and it's not difficult to understand why. From the story to the cast, from the cinematography to the sound, everything's top notch on this German film directed by Wolfgang Petersen (who's now helming more Hollywood flicks). I'd rate it above U-571, K19: The Widowmaker, Crimson Tide, and The Hunt for Red October.We follow the exploits of the crew of German U-boat U-96, as it gets sent on its mission to destroy Allied convoys. We learn of the frustrations of inaction, having no targets, and living the lonely life aboard a submarine. We experience the claustrophobic environment, one which is shared amongst crew, where maintaining hygiene and tolerable living conditions is of the utmost importance of staying well. We pick up on the fear of the Captain about his inexperienced crew, most of whom were in their early twenties, and haven't seen much action in the high seas.What's gripping in this film is when things start to pick up. Technology those days aren't as advanced, and we see that U-boats are more likely to be sitting ducks when Allied destroyers hover above them on the water's surface, dropping multiple depth charges to rattle and hopefully destroy their underwater prey. The U-boat is the hunter, but once it has hunted, it becomes the prey.And such is the marvellous depiction of Fear in the crew's eyes, as they huddle in silence each time the enemy lurks above. The suspense literally keeps you at the edge of your seat, the silence, deafening. Many set action pieces bring out the different scenarios and challenges that the crew face in their voyage on the seas, and all these capped by the beautiful soundtrack which accompanies each scene. My favourite was the charge through Gilbratar.Although this movie takes on an Axis power's point of view, one can discard the political aspect of this film, and understand that lives on both ends are similar - each are fathers, brothers, husbands, and are thrown into a senseless political war. It doesn't go preachy on who's right and wrong, but touches on more human and basic issues of survival. Boys become men, and it is this transformation that is most obvious throughout the story.If you've got the chance, you must see the Director's Cut, running at about 209 minutes, just as Wolfgang Petersen envisioned it to be. Excellent stuff!"
"In 1941, Britain and Germany are battling for control of crucial Atlantic supply routes. German submarine U-96 leaves the French port of La Rochelle; its mission, to inflict as much damage as possible on cargo-ship convoys.This is a unique movie and for my money one of the best war pictures ever made. Whilst maintaining a very high level of drama and suspense for a long film, it also seems so real and credible, and the filmmakers went to great lengths to convey this authenticity. It is based on an autobiographical novel by Lothar-Günther Buchheim who was a real-life war correspondent. The stunning submarine set by Rolf Zehetbauer was built with incredible attention to period detail and as an enclosed space, restricting the camera-work but adding tremendously to the crucial atmosphere of confinement. The great cast gave everything to the picture (for example, they were not allowed out in the sun during the shooting) and their transformation as it progresses into haggard, bearded, weary ghosts is startling and unsettling. Prochnow is stunning as the unnamed Captain; a man who has the respect of his crew yet is essentially alone, but the entire ensemble are brilliant - I especially like Wennemann (the chief engineer), Tauber (the navigator) and Hoenig (the radio-operator) all of whom give quiet, thoughtful, understated performances, very atypical in an epic movie filled with action. The eerily effective use of sound adds to the movie's tension, and there is brilliant claustrophobic camera-work by Jost Vacano. The depiction of the crew's struggles - alternating intolerable boredom with sheer terror when the alarm is raised, evading depth charges and destroyers, running dangerously deep to avoid detection, repairing the ship (literally everything breaks at some point), following suicidal orders - is the heart of the film. U-Boat crews had a one in four chance of surviving, and the movie's heartbreaking conclusion is deeply profound and moving, regardless of your views on World War II. This is a film about people, not politics, which is why it's such a great war movie. Shot as both a 145-minute feature released first, and as a six-hour TV miniseries screened later; this review is of an even better 200-minute version recut by Petersen and re-released in 1996."
"I just watched this movie on television here, not having seen it, but having it on my list of movies I should see should I ever stumble over them.All I can say is... WOAH.An excellent war film portraying the horrors of war from the point of view of the real soldiers struggling to survive, not to triumph.Highly recommended. I'm going to have to buy this film on DVD and watch it again, unprofaned by any commercial breaks."
"The more films I view, the harder it is to dole out a rating of '10', and I've never been liberal about it anyway. With ""Das Boot"", I have no such reservations. Here's a film that takes all your preconceived notions about Nazi villains and stands them on their head, by portraying a World War II submarine crew as human beings, facing life and death daily in the cramped confines of an underwater prison. Not only does one come to understand their plight, but sympathize with them as well, to the point of hoping that they make it through their Atlantic ordeal. The only problem being that once they do, a cruel fate intervenes to usurp the lives of innocents in a way that their harrowing underwater ordeal could not.Perhaps part of the reason that one identifies with the German cast has to do with the treatment of Adolph Hitler in the story. Not once was he identified as a Nazi hero or figure of respect. Early in the film, the Captain (Jurgen Prochnow) himself establishes his posture as less than a fan of the Fuhrer. The much later scene of the celebration in Vigo painted an even more resolute snub of Hitler by the officer crew of U-96, along with their elite German hosts. It is possibly the only time I've witnessed anything less than outright undying loyalty to the Nazi leader by members of the Party.Told from the German point of view by director Wolfgang Peterson, the story opens with the staggering statistic that only twenty five percent of Germany's forty thousand submarine sailors ever made it home alive. By Autumn 1941, the battle for the control of the Atlantic Ocean was turning against them, ominously conveyed by the Captain himself - ""Those Brits don't make mistakes anymore"". It's stated not in anger or defiance, but as a statement of fact, one which further emphasizes the plight of this enemy sub. Men crack under the pressure of battle, as personified by Johann 'the ghost' (Erwin Leder), who has a nervous breakdown before he can be of use to his Captain one last time. So fascinating is Peterson's direction, that the entire time the sub lies doomed on the ocean floor, this viewer finds himself saying a prayer along with the crew for that one unbelievable miracle that might pull them through.Through it all, I maintained such an alert focus that I managed to catch a continuity error. When Lt. Werner (Herbert Gronemeyer) returns the packet of letters to Ullman (Martin May) that he volunteered to forward to Ullman's pregnant girlfriend, it was only half the size of the original bundle.Prior to seeing this movie, it would have been hard to imagine a war film to be as compelling that hadn't been produced by Hollywood. However by any account, ""Das Boot"" ranks up there with not only the best war stories ever told, but one of the best movies ever committed to film. It deserves a strong recommendation."
"Probably the main reason that ""Das Boot"" is so great is because it shows that the men in the submarine aren't really Nazis: they were just drafted. But once the submarine dives, then the suspense sets in. Capt. Heinrich Lehmann-Willenbrock (Jurgen Prochnow) leads his men on a voyage of adventure and terror alike. As the viewer, you feel like you're in the submarine, getting attacked from all sides. Rarely do you see the kind of intensity that you see in this movie. Overall, it makes us question the idea of who's good and who's bad in wartime. It's widely agreed that the Axis Powers were the bad guys in WWII, but the men here don't hold Nazi ideology; we sympathize with them every step of the way. A great movie."
"Ten out of ten does not describe this film, it is more like fifteen out of ten. If you haven't seen this movie, you must! I saw it a few years ago, and the whole thing completely blew me away. The film is about a German reporter who travels on board a Nazi U-Boat to live with the German crew for a few months. (Note: The Film was filmed in German; watch it in German with subtitles. Its so much better and more realistic.) The sub is cramped, and the crew endures multiple hardships and problems as they travel through the seas during WWII. You are brought in to see the war from their point of view, you're not seeing it from the English, not from the US, you see it as a Nazi, which is quite an accomplishment for a film because the Nazis are nowadays normally frowned upon and disliked. You become attached to the crew, and you can almost feel the poor conditions of the sub as you watch. And then there's the end, which you make you run out of your living room screaming. Yes, it's that good. And I'm surprised that this film isn't as talked about as much or receives as much attention as other big films do such as Titanic. And in my opinion, it's far better. Now go to your movie store, or your Blockbuster, and get it, and watch it. You won't be disappointed."
"If you asked me why I expressed so much contempt toward pseudo 'great war' movies like ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Inglourious Basterds"", the answer is quite simple. Because there is still a certain breed of films that managed to perfectly capture the essence of War, among them, the masterpiece ""Apocalypse Now"", closely followed by the one I will review now: ""Das Boot"".""Das Boot"", the boat, what a title! Very restrained, yet extremely meaningful, for two reasons : first, it sets the film, the U-Boat commanded by the experienced and respected Captain Lieutenant Lehmann-Willenbrock, the boat as a Goddess-like character in the film, who has the power to kill or spare her infants. Secondly, the language: German. The protagonists are German and if you look at them at Nazis, you miss the point. The film doesn't invite us to cheer for guys who belong to the bad side, but to reconsider our own approach to War. Spielberg makes glorious War movies with simplistic 'good vs. bad guys' formulas, when he should have taken some lessons of realism from Wolfgang Petersen who made a movie about  men. They are only men who happen to wear one military suit, and we can't blame them for wearing 'the bad one'.Indeed, there is a lot to root for in the beginning, as they are not the cruel and stereotypical Germans, cinema used to portray, we're not in ""Stalag 17"" anymore, and the United States doesn't have the monopoly of War movies. A German director makes a movie about German soldiers for a change, and without any bias. He even, detached the main characters from any Nazi etiquette. At the drunken party in La Rochelle, the two veteran officers express very cynical ideas about Hitler : nice touch from Petersen not to portray the leads as zealous fanatics. The rest of the crew follows the orders, and during the first sequence, they just drink, dance, shout and vomit. The realism again works on a double level, it helps us to feel empathy for these young rosy-cheeked boys and pity at the same time; because this party could be their last. The fun is so extreme it almost looks like a last burst of youth and amusement before the serious adult stuff happens.And when it starts, you just have to hold your breath and prepare yourself for one of the most nightmarish and hellish journeys ever, making ""Apocalypse Now""'s mission look like a cruise. It's a modern odyssey conducted by one of the most haunting cinematic scores ever, and a beautiful cinematography. And the central character of this odyssey is Lieutenant Werner, the Correspondent. We discover the boat through his eyes, and share his discomfort among the regulars. He represents the audience, the coming-of-age element of the story, and inspires through his clumsiness some very interesting statements from the Captain, like in the beginning, when he asks him to wait till the soldiers have grown beards before taking pictures of them. They still look too shamefully young, but as the movie goes on, their facial features become mature and likelier to make us accept a tragic fate. Facing other clean-shaved and well-dressed officers later, we notice the difference; they didn't act like Nazis; at the end, they don't even look like soldiers. ""Das Boot"" creates indeed a quite alienating environment, like living a War in microcosm.There's a growing feeling of claustrophobia invading our hearts, as we're embarked with these men making the empathy work on a physical level. When they listen to the ultrasonic detector with that scary repetitive sound, you know the shock is imminent. The question is: when? The thrills are so intolerable that the shock comes almost as a relief. But the worst has yet to come when they're hit by a flight attack that cause their sinking. It goes down, deeper and deeper, even below the pressure limit the previous false alarm taught us. It's a suffocating experience, and an extraordinary thrilling moment ... For my part, I literally held my breath, couldn't even gulp, didn't know what I was waiting for. Since there were Germans, and we know they won't win the War, they could really die in the boat, but that would have been too predictable I guess. And from the way they handled the crisis, becoming just men, crying, going mad, praying, struggling, while driven by their self-conservation instinct, we understand, that they're only victims of the alienating effect War applies on human minds, and when they think their fate sealed, they realize that all the military pride is just bullshit.But the ending is probably what saddened me the most, not to mention the shock. After all they went through, they died anyway, on the harbor, at their arrival. The point? I guess if the Germans were not the good guys of WWII, when it came to the individual battles, it was just a side against another one, they were still fathers, brothers, sons, lovers, dying there. We feel uncomfortable in the scene where they refuse to help the poor Allies soldiers drowning after the bombing of their destroyer, but in a way, it's another sign of maturity from the German director: now they are the 'poor' soldiers, every death is tragic  And we feel sad because we rooted for them. The second point, is to show that after having understood the very pointlessness of War when they were in the bottom, they simply lowered their guard again, drunken by the appetite of victory, which transformed their joy into hysterical screams of disbelief during the bombings. As if you must lose in order to understand the meaning of War.Which might explain why the best War movies are still about wars that were lost, after all ..."
"all i can say is..i love this film...this movie and others like Stalingrad, cross of iron and downfall, to name a few, are more entertaining and ""gritty"" than all the pro alliance Gung-ho for America movies that have been churned out since the end of the second world war. i say this not as a political point but as an honest opinion...how many times can you sit and watch America/england with America take the beaches etc... the Germans were in the war too... my granddad even said that a bridge too far wasn't realistic and he WAS THERE IN ARNHAM. all the political correctness seems to have overridden the basic truth in movies, if it is based on real events then make it real... Das Boot gave you the claustrophobic feeling of being in a 1940's Uboat in the north sea/Atlantic ocean, hunting whilst being hunted. the acting is suburb and the tension between the actors at times is brilliant. truly capturing what it might have been like in the sub. i would recommend this movie to anyone. regardless of their movie reference."
"Yep, seems like almost universal praise here, and there's little else to say, but Das Boot (director's cut) really is that good. Just some of the reasons:1. Jürgen Prochnow put forth an acting performance that qualifies as one of the best ever in any movie, and more than half of it could be found in his facial expressions and quietude alone. Of course, when he lets his emotions loose at certain pivotal moments in the film, the audience is spellbound, and Prochnow commands the scenes of the movie as surely as his character commands the ship and its crew. This character is intricate in the extreme, but almost never overtly so.2. The movie snowballs into one of the most intense and addicting film experiences I've ever come across. At three and 1/2+ hours, it manages to become more and more engaging. There are moments (especially towards the end) where the tempo of the movie is so fine-tuned that one is impelled to stare at the screen and become emotionally fused, as it were, with the plight of the characters.3. Related to #1, the casting for the film was such that personalities came forth in faces alone at times. Secondary characters with few lines are given the benefit of personality and even character development through their actions and faces, combined with the little scrapings of dialogue each of them gets. We almost empirically know what these people are like. Dialogue is very important in this movie, but the physical characteristics of the actors match ALL of the characters' personalities so well here that one suspects that these people aren't acting. And really, that's what it's all about, right? That we should not realize that this is just make-believe? We see funny people, serious people, tired people, uptight people...it all works perfectly well. Great, natural acting by all.4. The steady-cam claustrophobia betrays genuine craft in the direction of this movie. One gets the feeling of a cramped space throughout the film. Likewise, within this small space, there is still room for direction, and the composition of the shots are all superb. Another thing: the film quality is very clean for a movie that was made in 1983, and stands up to today's work well - this movie doesn't really date itself visually, which is a rare thing.5. The story line and dialogue were original and completely realistic. There are few words uttered and few moments in the movie that I wouldn't have believed. It steers clear of some of the gross exaggerations of certain Hollywood-style war films, both in heroic dialogue and also during person-to-person banter while characters are just hanging around off-duty.
6. The representation of boredom is an interesting concept in this film, and one that Hollywood is usually uncomfortable with. Here, we see moments where the crew simply sits around doing nothing, and the film, for some of these moments, goes nowhere with them - stalling out in the middle of the ocean. Is this a bad thing? No. It's an objective construction of the boredom of NOT seeing constant action, and the director takes the time to do it right, without blatantly telling the audience, ""ok, the character is bored here. See that? Right. Next scene. Now we're going to make something interesting happen right away"". And you know what? The boredom of the crew is fascinating to behold.7. The set was a masterpiece. A near perfect recreation, and weathered and propped perfectly down to the last detail.8. The music was low-key enough that it didn't intrude on the organic drama going on in the picture. I'm not crazy about the score, but at least it wasn't hitting me over the head every twenty seconds. It is sparse, and incidental sound in general in the re-master was really impressive, and is the real sonic contributor much more so than the music.9. The subject matter is great - a very subjective thing, but aren't U-Boats and the Atlantic War just interesting? I think so. And I'm glad that U-571 isn't the only movie out there about them - because it did absolutely nothing as far as showing what LIVING was like inside of one. 'Das Boot' made this factor absolutely integral to the nature of the movie, and for that, it's unequaled by any war film save perhaps the Finnish movie 'Talvisota'.If you haven't seen it, please do. It's an important and excellent film."
"Das Boot is one of the best anti-war movies ever to have left the mind of any director. The chilly feeling of suspense along with the boredom felt with the men trapped in the cigar-like can, is the marking of this great movie. Sadly enough only the Director's Cut is available for us ""fanatics"". The original mini-series is nowhere to be found and that is a tragedy as it contains at least 10 - 20 minutes more material that only adds to the incredible depth of the characters. Jürgen Prochnow has never been seen better as the Captain, who commands the boat with a stern hand, and his not quite so well hidden distaste for ""Der Führer""."
"This anti war movie comes from Germany, that has had to learn the anti war lesson well, though they seem to be forgetting it recently. But this is a powerful movie, true classic and a must see movie."
"If you think war is about glory and medals and patriotism and an evil enemy, think again. War is protrayed here to be very real, very gritty, with not much glory in the end. In stead of forcing the melodrama upon us, in stead of painting the enemy as monsters, we see ordinary men caught up in the reality of it all.
This is, as the other reviewers have pointed out, a legendary movie."
"A sheer masterpiece of unrelenting terror that makes impeccable use of its claustrophobic atmosphere, nerve-wracking tension & nail-biting suspense to deliver a World War II epic that's still unsurpassed in the authenticity of its tension & realism, Das Boot is a naval adventure unlike anything seen on film before or since. A masterwork of pristine craftsmanship that's as refined in the storytelling department as it is flawless in its technical execution, this quintessential submarine film isn't just one of the greatest films ever made but is arguably the very pinnacle of German cinema."
"When movies are at their best, they can take the viewer completely into a different world. Watching this movie again, I felt very much transported.It seems unfair to call this a submarine movie because it is so much better rendered than any other offering from that genre. Das Boot transcends all the necessary clichés and tells an amazing story in an incredibly convincing way. In this rare instance, the writers understand that the truth is plenty fascinating, with no need for exaggerated action or melodrama.Technically, this film is a marvel. The camera work is astounding, most of it done hand-held in a real submarine environment where it's hard enough to move, let alone shoot a movie. What special effects there are blend in so seamlessly, it's hard to imagine how they could have made this picture without putting the cast in harm's way.It's a delight to see the director's cut which feels very natural in its pacing. There are long, slow sections which are not boring to watch, but they effectively illustrate what the crew has to endure as they wait weeks on end for some real action. When the action finally comes, the buildup is tremendous. Few movies match Das Boot's dynamic range.All the technical and dramatic devices are in perfect harmony with the human element. One quickly forgets how this crew is fighting for Hitler's Third Reich. They're really just a bunch of kids, lead by a jaded captain. Their ordeal becomes so severe, it's impossible not to have sympathy for them. Because of this, Das Boot should be ranked among the very best of all war films."
"Wolfgang Peterson, wrote and directed this superb film of submarine life during World War II. When first seen by an American audience, reactions were mixed. Halfway into the film, the German crew begins to exhibit some universal traits which touch the heart of anyone fighting for a cause. Gone is the reason why the seamen are fighting often-times an unseen enemy. The reasons are replaced by a plethora of dangerous and certainly dramatic events which allow an audience to see the life and death struggle of all veterans. The visual heart of this unusual movie, is that of an experienced German Captain (Jürgen Prochnow) who sails the Atlantic, meeting both friend and foe alike. With him are his aids, Lt. Henrich (Lehmann-Willenbrock), Herbert Grönemeyer as Lt. Werner and Klaus Wennemann who is superior as Chief Engineer. When they realize the war is nearly over, they head for home. Unfortunately they are spotted, targeted and attacked by the English navy. Now comes some heart-pounding action as most of the crew expect to die before reaching home. Seen from the perspective of an American audience, one expects the inevitable. Yet, from the audience point of view, one can not help but sympathize for the Captain and his valiant crew. A Great film indeed. ****"
"I watched this movie for the first time on DVD, at home alone and with headphones on.I was gripping the edge of the chair during the tense underwater scenes, I felt I was aboard the U- boat . A sure sign of a great movie is when the viewer feels a part of it. The whole cast were believable, as were the characters they portrayed. A definite 10/10 movie. I preferred the sub titles to the dubbed voices concept,as the film is shown and heard as it was meant to be. Director Wolfgang Petersen takes us through a fantastic journey,giving us an insight into the fun, fears and general life aboard a German submarine during the second world war. The films ironic ending tops off the tragic reality of war,regardless of what side you were on."
"It is an excellent film.I saw it the first time in Germany and I've seen it a lot of more times,even though it is a very long film. This kind of films prove that movies can also be made outside of Hollywood. It is a piece of art , more than a commercial movie,and that is what makes Petersen such a good director in this film.I felt I was at that submarine together with those heroic sailors. It's true that they were fighting for the wrong side,but that was the real war.Those men were human beings trying to survive in a war they couldn't understand,but they fought for their country,families and honor. I never saw such a realistic war film.The closest was Saving Private Ryan.Also Prochnow was great and the rest of the cast,too. Congratulations to Wolfgang Petersen!!!!"
"(There may be some elements in this review which constitute plot-spoilers). I saw the full length ""Director's Cut"" and thank god it wasn't the dubbed version. This film has to be seen in its full length to be fully appreciated as a true masterpiece and dubbing only serves to take away some of the impact of the dialogue.The director handles matters from an entirely balanced view and shows the submariners aboard the u-boat as being both heroes and cowards as they swing from hunters to hunted. There is one scene where the captain views a convoy from a distance and almost leisurely takes aim and sinks boats with a callous and cold professionalism. One can't help feeling that the men in the u-boat are firing upon defenceless victims who have no chance of defending themselves, but moments later, the u-boat is under what seems like an immediate attack from a destroyer and suddenly the hunters become the prey. As the movie progresses it is hard not to feel sympathetic towards the crew of the u-boat and it is almost impossible not to see them as victims.The film ultimately stands as a bold and brilliantly crafted portrayal of the futility of war. There is one discussion between the captain and his second in command which I can remember quite vividly. The captain explains that the u-boat cannot be sunk by the sea which is an obvious expression of the fact that the boat is designed to dive and surface at will, but his comment from the captain also implies that although the sea cannot sink the submarine, everything that the enemy has at their disposal is designed to hunt down and destroy the u-boat.If you are a fan of submarine films and there are lots of them (Red October and Crimson Tide - to name but a few) then you should seriously consider watching Das Boot. It lacks the gloss and glamour of other films of this type and concentrates on the hardship of the crew and the almost squalid conditions in which they are forced to live.The end is one of the most powerful scenes in any war movie and points to the fact that in the end everything that men do in war is pointless and without any honour or heroism. At the end of the movie I thought ""what was the point in any of that"", and then it hit me that that was precisely the reaction the director was after.By the way, U-boat stands for: ""under sea boat"" and I don't know how true it is, but I heard that one of the full size models used in Das Boot was used again in Raiders Of The Lost Arc."
"Quite simply the best war film ever made. Das Boot nearly got made in the United States, with Robert Redford (!) in the starring role as the submarine's captain. Thank goodness it didn't; instead it went to a German production company with the then largely unknown Wolfgang Petersen and Jurgen Prochnow directing and starring respectively.Petersen brings an obsessive level of detail to the screen, recreating the U-boat down to quite literally the last rivet and creating an extraordinary sense of claustrophobia - I've never experienced anything quite like it in the cinema. The effect is greatly enhanced by the sound, which is up there with ""Saving Private Ryan"" in terms of convincing you that you're in the middle of a battle. It really has to be experienced in a cinema, although you might get away with using a really good sound system at home (get the DVD Director's Cut version for this).Even more remarkable is the cast. Prochnow is the highlight, of course, as the quietly heroic captain of the boat. But the rest of the cast - largely stage actors appearing on screen for the first time, or complete unknowns - are equally remarkable: Erwin Leder (in his first appearance on screen) is a standout as the veteran Chief Engineer, Johann, who faces a crisis of courage when the boat comes under attack. There really isn't a single performance that you can fault.So is there anything actually *wrong* with Das Boot? Some of the external shots are distinctly unconvincing, quite obviously being of model ships and projected backdrops. (Blame that on film technology circa 1981). The film does have a tendency to drag a bit in a few places - the section where the crew go ashore in Vigo is a case in point. Above all, steer well clear of the dubbed version, even though the dubbing into English is done by many of the original cast - this is a film which absolutely must be seen in the original German (with subtitles).However, these are minor quibbles when the rest of the film is so good. There are very few films that I would instantly rate a 10, but this is one of them."
"This is an excellent 15 million dollars German movie chronicling the strong conditions of forty three men assigned to a U-Boot in 1941 . This exciting film contains nail-biting action , drama , suspense in a claustrophobic atmosphere . During WWII forty thousand young German served aboard Nazi subs , only ten thousand survived . This is the story of 43 raw recruits caught up in a war they didn't understand, and the Captain who must lead them in their struggle to survive .The claustrophobic as well as realistic world of a WWII German U-boat was meticulously mounted ; retelling boredom , filth , and sheer terror . It recreates faithfully the tension , hardship and claustrophobic conditions of the young seamen . The bulk of the film's $15 million budget was spent on constructing U-boats , the plans were taken to the original builder of the subs, who was commissioned to build a full-sized , sea-going replica , their first such assignment since the war ended ; second full-sized model was built for interior filming . A miniature submarine was used for scenes in which we see the submarine from outside , the model was steered from the inside by a diver . While shooting scale models in the Northern Sea, filming was disturbed by doves landing on the submarine . The submarine models built for Das Boot were also the ones used in Raiders of the lost ark (1981). In addition , it arranges to embrace an anti-war message concerning thought-provoking and brooding issues . Originally a five hour German TV miniseries , later released in a 217 minutes filmmaker's cut . Interesting screenplay by the same filmmaker Wolfgang Petersen based on Lothar G. Buchheim's autobiographical novel . Perfectly played by Jurgen Prochnow as commander and a solid support cast as Herbert Grönemeyer , Jan Fedder , Otto Sander and Uwe Ochsenknecht . To help his actors convey the claustrophobic conditions found on a real U-boat, director Wolfgang Petersen insisted on filming within the actual confines of the ship , scarcely wider than a man's outstretched arms , rather than removing the model's outer Wall . Thrilling and enjoyable musical score by Klaus Doldinger . Colorful and appropriate cinematography by Jost Vacano . In order to get the fast tracking shots through the U-boat without a shaky image , director of photography created a system of heavy gyroscopes that kept the camera steady as he ran through the hallways . The motion picture was lavishly produced by Mark Damon , John Hyde , Edward R. Pressman , being compellingly directed by the great filmmaker/writer Wolfgang Petersen . The film was nominated for six Academy Awards which was at the time the highest number of Oscar nominations ever received by a foreign language film . The movie provides a realistic detailing of life aboard and a portrait about the crews subjected to stressful and psychological tensions . In fact the sailors had sleep in shifts . For months they were lodged in close quarters because every inch the space was needed for machinery , supplies and torpedoes . The air was heavy with odors from bilges,diesel oil and unwashed bodies . The men faced sudden death from depth charges ,aerial bombing attacks or the sharp bow of a swift destroyer as happen in this film . The picture is based on historic deeds , thus the construction of new U-boats continued at a record -breaking during WWII . In 1942-43 Hitler raised enormously his U-boat strength , the German submarines sank numerous ships, in early 1943 the called ¨Wolf packs¨ sank 90 ships in 20 days.Then,suddenly , between March and June 1943 , an exceptional change took place . The Allies began to win the war against Hitler's underwater in the Battle of the Atlantic . By this time the technique of submarines warfare had advanced far beyond that used in the beginning the war . The Allies pitted thousands of boats , seamen , destroyers , cruisers ,subs , cannons and billion of dollars against the undersea craft . As early as December 1943 Karl Doeniz , the architect and designer of U-boat campaign, admitted the grave turn in events . The cost was great on both sides . In the six years of war , the Germans , by their own statistics , destroyed more than 2000 British , Allied ships in the sea . Hitler had built 1162 subs , of which 783 were lost . Of the 41000 men recruited into the underwater service , between 28000 and 32000 lost their lives and 500 were taken prisoners ."
"Das Boot (1981)Widely considered the most impressive submarine movie ever made, I'll go so far as to say it's easily the most accurate that I've seen. The action scenes, the sense of doom, the eerie quiet and then explosive depth charges, the grime and the crowded conditions, all of this is palpable. But more impressive, I think, is how the movie works as a German movie about Germans in a war where the Germans were painted as evil. American movies to this day still glorify and make heroic their roles in WWII (unlike the willingness, at times, to show the problems of Americans involved in Viet Nam, say), especially in the European side. But in movie after movie, the German film industry has confronted the real problem of being aggressors, and of being under the Nazi sway. ""Das Boot"" is typical, and key. The captain goes so far as to openly make fun of the German propaganda coming in on their radio. It isn't just that war is bad, but that the Nazis are bad.Nevertheless, there they are, and they have a job to do, and they're going to do it well. So a small group of men in a small underwater tin can try to survive the boredom as much as the British, who come very close to getting them several times. It's a great movie, one of the best at capturing the feeling of being there.What is less impressive, at times, is the more ordinary character development that seems inevitable in a movie this long--2 ½ to 4 hours depending on the version you have, I saw the long one, the director's cut. I think the acting is superb, and so it's easy to go along with the conversations and interactions, but they aren't always compelling in themselves, more just creating some space before the next conflict arises. Maybe, in some honest sense, this is exactly how it would have been. Life for most people is pretty ordinary.But this movie is not. Or it makes what is ordinary in war--the nostalgic to the profound and deadly--believable, and not simply big and dramatic, which it also is. For full German effect, I suggest seeing it with the original German language track on and subtitles if you need them, though I tested the dubbed version in English and it's really well done. I also suggest, if you have doubts about such an involved war movie, trying to find the older, shorter release. The visuals are not enhanced, but some of the character development sections are left out and I don't think you'll miss them. Then, of course, if you want the whole kit and caboodle, try to find the 5 hour version released in sections for British and German television."
"This epic masterpiece has influenced nearly all the war movies, many action and suspense movies, and all submarine movies since it's first release in 1981. Especially in the area of realism. If you look for it, you can see it's influence in such different movies as Aliens, Die Hard, Apollo 13, The Alamo, The Right Stuff, The Hunt for Red October, Tears of the Sun, Crimson Tide, Top Gun, K19 the Widowmaker, and many more. I really think Bruce Willis studied Jürgen Prochnow's portrayal of the Captain, among others like Clint Eastwood, to learn how to express emotions with just his eyes and minimal facial expressions.The movie starts with the grim statistic that of the 40,000 men who served in U-Boats in WWII, 30,000 didn't survive. No other branch of any military service that fought in WWII had 3/4 of the men who served in it KIA. Military historians have noted that if the commander of the German submarine forces, Admiral Karl Donitz, had been provided with most of the 300 U-Boats he asked for to start the war with, (he had 57, only 20 of them suitable for ocean-going operations), he could have effectively cut Great Britain's supply lines, and probably forced them to capitulate. One of the oldest military maxims states: ""Amatuers study tactics, professionals study logistics"". Thank God Hitler was an amateur!The cinematography, lighting, sound design, mock-ups, props, and production design set new standards for the industry. Cinematographer Jost Vacano designed a special Arriflex camera to film most of the interior sequences to convey the claustrophobic atmosphere of the boat. It is a miniaturized version of a Steadicam that has 2 gyroscopes for stability. Vacano wore full-body padding to minimize injury as he ran and the mock-up was rocked and shaken. Wolfgang Petersen insisted that every gage, control, hatch, torpedo tube, piece of equipment, and fitting in the hydraulically mounted interior mock-up had to exactly match that of a Type VIIC-class U-boat, down to the smallest screw. This attention to detail extended to virtually every aspect of the production. Here's an interesting sidelight. All of the main actors speak fluent English as well as German; when the film was dubbed into English, each actor recorded his own part. The German version is actually dubbed as well; the film itself was shot ""silent"", since in any case the dialog spoken on-set would have been drowned out by the gyroscopes in the special camera developed for filming. I saw the subtitled version when it was first released in the US, and own the Director's cut on DVD. I prefer to watch it with the English language soundtrack, and I swear that it's so well synchronized with the actor's lip movements that I can't tell that it's dubbed!The strong ensemble cast, many of whom went on to successful careers in the German and American entertainment industry, is an integral part of the movie's success. Since they are listed on the main movie page, I'm not going to duplicate it here. Most of the filming was done in one year; to make the appearance of the actors as realistic as possible, scenes were filmed in sequence over the course of the year. This ensured natural growth of beards and hair, increasing skin pallor, and signs of strain on the actors, who had, just like real U-boat men, spent many months in a cramped, unhealthy atmosphere. Throughout the filming, the actors were forbidden to go out into the sunlight, to create the pallor of men who seldom saw the sun during their missions. The actors went through intensive training to learn how to move quickly through the narrow confines of the vessel. Movies like this, The Great Escape, and the Lord of the Rings trilogy form the basis of a strong argument that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences needs to add an award category for best ensemble cast. Heinrich Lehmann-Willenbrock, the captain of the real U-96, survived the war and was one of the consultants for this movie.To me, the saddest thought that occurs to me every time I see it is that they wasted all that incredible courage on the biggest A$$HOLE in human history, Adolph Hitler. Boo! Hiss! Pbththt! (The last is a Bronx cheer!) These sentiments are for AH, not the movie. To learn more about it, see the article on Wikipedia. This is one of those movies EVERYONE should watch at least once in their life."
"""Das Boot"" is an excellent drama...and it's also more terrifying than virtually every horror film I've ever seen. The dark, dirty, claustrophobic environment of the submarine is something out of a nightmare. Even the sound effects are scary - the boom of the depth charges, the groaning of the hull under pressure, the ""ping!"" of bursting bolts, etc. etc. The images, the sounds, and the charged performances of the actors work together beautifully to create the illusion that fifty men are fighting for their lives in an amazing but fragile piece of machinery.But the film is more than just an intense sensory experience - it's also an unusually well-written, antiwar character piece. While some of the sub's crew members are inevitably underdeveloped (in the director's cut version, anyway), most of them are interesting and memorable. Actor Jurgen Prochnow is fantastic as the cynical captain, who still fights hard even though he's clearly lost his faith in the Nazi regime. Herbert Grönemeyer is pretty good as the war correspondent, who starts as an outsider but gradually blends in with the veteran crew. The other standout character, for me, is Johann (Erwin Leder), who has one of the most gaunt and frightening faces in movie history.Speaking of the crew, some critics have complained that the film is far too sympathetic to them, since the Germans were the universally recognized bad guys of World War II. But, while I believe that Nazi Germany was the most despicable state in human history, I don't necessarily feel that every German who served in its armed forces was despicable. In other words, I simply have no problem sympathizing with the German characters in this movie. They're common fighters, not policy-makers; you can't blame them for Hitler's doings any more than you can blame the average contemporary American for George W. Bush's Middle East policies.The other common criticism of the film is that it's a little too long, too slow, too repetitive, whatever. I can understand why some people might be bored by ""Das Boot,"" but of course director Peterson actively tried to make parts of the film slow in order to simulate the tedium of daily life on a submarine. (Similarly, ""The French Connection"" depicts surveillance as a tedious and time-consuming business, and risks becoming tedious itself). Anyway, as far as I'm concerned, if you're mentally prepared for a long and tough viewing experience, then these aspects of ""Das Boot"" should not annoy you. If you want an action submarine movie, then by all means rent something cute and inoffensive like ""Crimson Tide""! Perhaps the one real weakness of ""Das Boot"" is that it utilizes dated model effects. The models draw you out of the realism a bit - you may find yourself wondering who turned off ""Das Boot"" and put on ""Godzilla"" instead - but, for the time, they look fine (I could point to several equivalently lame model shots in ""Star Wars,"" for instance, but that would be blasphemy.) Anyway, the effects are certainly respectable enough to earn our (slight) indulgence.There are really no problems with this movie, then - it's one of those ""just about perfect"" films. It's not pleasant to watch, and in fact I put off seeing it for years because I knew it would be really intense. But, if you're in the mood, ""Das Boot"" is a rare visceral and intellectual treat. War movies really don't get any better."
"This film will grab you from the opening shot and suck you into its grim, realistic portrayal of life aboard a German U-Boat. If your looking for 'gung-ho' action then i'm pleased to say you'll be grandly disappointed. W.P (the director) and the actors have captured pure tension, absolute horror and genuine fear with alarming accuracy. It feels like your watching the 'real thing', not a movie. (And if, like me, you have to watch the subtitled version, this feels even more so! Note: Avoid the dubbed version, it ruins any suspense as the 'acting' is abysmal!)Characterisation is wonderful in this film, the change in each man as their voyage becomes ever more doomed is gripping. Because of the films length, you can really experience why characters act as they do, their motivations and changing mental states are utterly believable and adds to the films substance. Every time a depth charge drops, you can smell the sweat coming off the foreheads of the actors, and thats testament just as much to the cinematography as the acting. You feel like your on board the boat. Just watching the men on board move around gives the viewer a sense of just how cramped conditions were, and this heightens the overall sense of isolation they must have felt. (For the most part) they have no contact with the outside world, just the guts of the boat and what their instruments and sounds tell them.All in all, a far superior war film to say, the likes of Saving Private Ryan, which although employing skilled techniques and creative cinematography, forgot to motivate and 'humanise' its characters. D.B illustrates how effective good acting, directing and intelligent writing can combine (without the need for 'Hollywood' production values) to produce a moving, powerful masterpiece of a film that will live long in the memory."
"Hey,This film here is incredible for it's time to say the least. I own the director's cut DVD-9 and what an upgrade compared to the VHS with all the extras. Jurgen always does a fine job as a lead actor, most of the crew on aboard the U-boat are relative unknown German actors at that time in '81, I must say they really did a fine job on making the suspense and the overall feeling really real. I mean, if you have a 5.1 surround sound stereo in your house, you feel the adrenaline, the sound of depth charges hitting the water, the stress and anxiety of the crew. In a word, awesome ! This movie isn't just for WWII war fanatics alone. It a good movie about people working together under an unbelievable amount of stress."
"I watched the 216 minutes Director's Cut and I must say that even if it lasted for over 3 hours it was not boring.Das Boot takes place on a German sub during World War 2. It follows the crew of 43 young men who sets sail in fall, 1941. A war correspondent is among them. He is to go with them and write a newspaper article about the life on a sub. A life he soon discover, along with the rest of the crew, is nothing like portrayed by Nazi propaganda.This film tells a good, strong and emotional story. It does not tell the tale oft a sub, but it tells the tale of the people aboard that sub. You get to know these characters and you get sympathy for them. It is a strong and well written story and it makes a strong film.The acting is good. I watched the English version so I got the German accent, but that didn't bother me. Not as long as the acting in it self is as good as it is.The film-makers have done a great job when it comes to creating a mood in this film. Excellent lightning, great sound-editing and good production design should be given credit for that. The narrow, claustrophobic set along with the lightning creates a really tense and dramatic setting. The use of sound and score reinforce this. They know when to use music and when to use silence. The active use of the ""biping"" noise is excellent.In other words great cinematography and sound work. The score is also very nice. It has a couple of themes. The music in it self is good and they make good use of them.To me Das Boot is a must see classic. It's definitely one of the best war movies. It has humanity, sympathy and realism all over it. It's long, but don't let that scare you. It's definitely worth your time!"
"Writer-Director Wolfgang Peterson proves that he knows how to do his stuff. Forget Saving Private Ryan. This, along with Platoon and Apocalypse Now, are the ultimate war movies of all time. Superb direction from Peterson, almost impossible cinematography, great editing and sound design make this movie awesome. Made on a small budget of just $15m, Peterson insisted that he would film entirely inside a U-boat so that the entire cast and crew would get the real feeling of living in a U-boat. The results - the best war movie ever made. 11 out of 10!"
"As a former US Navy STS3 (third class submarine sonar tech) I remain convinced (along with the other ""bubbleheads"" who have posted here) that ""Das Boot"" is to date, far and away the best ""submarine film"" ever. Unlike this one, most films of this genre are not true ""submarine films,"" but either dramas, comedies or political thrillers where the submarine is a mere prop, a backdrop.In ""Das Boot,"" the characters are well developed and subtly varied, and the camaraderie among is not forced or self-conscious, but is simple and straightforward and flows from the shared experiences of being underway and in close quarters. The submarine itself is the main character, the entire crew ""becomes"" the sub and all action and meaning follows from that. Moreover, the differences between the captain and the ""Number 1"" (executive officer) character are quite believable, #1 almost satirically but perfectly reflected as the-insufferably-ambitious-jerk-who-is-already-planning-his-post -military-political-campaign.Juergen Prochnow's character as the captain is quite compelling. His moody and long stares, economy of words and the pensive air surrounding him him coexist well within his firm and able but low-key leadership style. The sea and its awesome power and wonder mean more to him than anything and his humility (and his humanity) seems in large part drawn from his seafaring experience which long predates the war.The air of pervasive fatalism that surrounds the U96 no matter what happens touches well upon a little recognized fact that the German Kriegsmarine (Navy) was, in contrast to the other branches of the German military in WWII, all but ignored; this disdain stemming largely from Hitler's utter lack of serious knowledge or interest in the role of sea power in warfare.Hence, the U96's enemy is not really the Royal Navy's destroyers or patrol planes, rather it is its own command in Berlin under whose orders it ostensibly operates, and, at a deeper level, the power of an unforgiving sea and each sailor's own fears. The captain's anger over not receiving any orders, his vocal ridicule of Hermann Goering and his blank, almost contemptuous stares at the small photo of Admiral Karl Doenitz are thus all quite in character. The U96 and the other boats have been, for all practical purposes, mere pesky details the Fuehrer has already written off and so the physical isolation of the U96 crew is thus compounded with a very real sense of abandonment, not even allowed the simple victory of mere survival, which makes the sailors' tragic fate that much more poignant.Although I am no film critic, I get the impression that the director (Wolfgang Petersen) had a great appreciation and knowledge of the cinematic techniques of Akira Kurosawa as well as of Russian filmmakers like Andrei Tarkovsky and of great familiarity with classic English war dramas like ""Sink the Bismarck."" His Kurosawa-like portrayal of the often baffling nature of human behavior in various situations, the Russian literary theme of the individual facing the colossal power of nature (in this case, the sea) and the meticulous attention to detail, continuity and realistic characterization representing the best of British cinema are all apparent here."
"As a former USN anti-submarine warfare operator, I'm always attracted to submarine movies. I can't believe it took me so long to finally see this incredible film. Most sub movies leave me wanting a lot more reality injected into the movie, but not this one. I felt like a crewman on that boat with those sailors and could not turn away for the 3 plus hours it ran. I watched the directors cut, in German with the subtitles, and was so absorbed in the story that it didn't subtract from it one bit.It wasn't political at all and I found myself pulling for these men to make it, to survive. Don't get me wrong, I am as red white and blue as they come, but this movie takes you to the most basic, deepest levels of what it must have been like to serve in the most incredible of circumstances, and I imagine that every sub of that era went through the same things. I didn't see them as Nazi's or the enemy, the film did a magnificent job of just showing them as human beings. I loved everything about this epic and can't wait to watch it with my son, who just got out of the navy after serving 5 years on a fast attack sub. Outstanding job from everyone involved, especially the actor that played the captain, brilliant!"
"I saw this film in a theater when it was a recent release, 1982. Was so impressed by the realism that afterward I wrote to a friend: ""It makes Star Wars look like a Porky Pig cartoon!"" But seriously, the U-boats were a major danger to allied shipping, and American and British sailors cursed at them. Das Boot shows the German side of the story with the crewmen cursing in German (with English subtitles) at the destroyers overhead. The German sailors were shown as regular people bravely doing their best in very difficult situations, not as mindless, fanatical Nazis like a cheesy American film might portray them. The cinematography was excellent, really made me feel like was in sub with them. Thankfully it wasn't in smellovision."
"Following an inexperienced German U-boat crew and their veteran commander during a tour of duty in the North Atlantic, Das Boot is a remarkable film about both submarine warfare and the Second World War. It does an unparalleled job of capturing the closeness of warfare under water, cramping both the actors and the camera into spaces that induce claustrophobia. This closeness does an excellent job of heightening the tension, which is a difficult thing to maintain in a movie of this nature.Indeed the majority of the movie is concerned with the anxious waiting that the crew undergoes as they stalk the ocean for their prey. The day in and day out of waiting for the order to strike occupies a great deal of the film and though this might have been tedious in a lesser film, it is well handled through a combination of great acting and good writing. Through the pen of the naval journalist that accompanies the crew and through the visual description of the day to day life aboard the submarine the audience cannot help but join the crew in hoping for that final release of tension that comes with action.Action does find the crew, taking them from victory to defeat quite rapidly. One of the most masterful sections of the film though comes when the boat becomes stuck on the bottom of the straits of Gibraltar. These scenes drip with the feelings of heavy, moist, over recycled air, and are shot through with the feeling of a desperately calm urgency, with so many of the boat's systems to repair and so little that most of the men can do to save themselves. What is captured could be described as a situation of great horror, undeniably trapped and beyond all hope of escape.The film has an extremely powerful ending, with triumph turned tragedy in a brief, crowded moment. The joy of a return home is transformed into the sorrow of death in a statement to the ephemeral nature of victory, one that seems to be shot through the film.The film seems to send a message about a war without politics, that while the reasons for a war may be intensely political, its execution is in the end a personal one. The film is intensely fair in its portrayal of German sailors, showing that not every German fighting man in the time was a Nazi. Even the ideological young lieutenant is portrayed as being more Naïve than anything else, avoiding the cliché of a ravening, two-dimensional Nazi, or even a world-blind fanatic.Das Boot may be one of the finest war films ever made. It captures the feeling of its subject admirably, the claustrophobia and waiting of submarine warfare, the mixed joys of victory and defeat, and a sympathetic view towards all sides, something that can be difficult to attain in war films. A great film in general, with a powerful message, good cinematography, and fantastic acting."
"Well - a very exciting movie with very good attention to detail. I liked the German with English subtitles - the dubbed version didn't have the impact their language provides. Some beautiful scenes and some very scary scenes. J. Prochnow was the perfect choice for the Kapitan. What was also very good - was the dialog in which they criticize their own leaders & make no pretense about their doubts about the war. The ending bothered me in that the boat he loved sank before his very eyes. But - in the German Navy - the submariners suffered the highest casualty rate. Of the 35,000 submarine sailors - barely 4,000 ever survived the war. But - this is a movie I could watch over & over again. Cannot say that about too many other movies. Very good directing & cinematography. Wish they'd make more films like this. Want to discuss it - I'm at ml2348@att.com"
"When I heard that a German WW2 story was being filmed I wondered how they would portray themselves....This was one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen...you feel as if YOU are part of the crew, you will live or die in a small steel cylinder around 100 feet long. This movie takes the books antiwar bend and uses it to probe the heart and soul of each of us who see this film.... As many of us no know first hand there are no real hero's on any side just men doing what has been asked of them... In this movie these ""nasty vile Natzis"" turn out to be mostly just human beings trying to survive as we were back then. WAR IS HELL.......a living breathing hell that you shall carry along with you the rest of your days on earth. This film pulls no punches it speaks right to you....""We are humans to we have the right to survive and live a life"" Both myself and most all I know were deeply moored by this film see it in German first ( English subtitles) then try the English version.... This is a war action story that is as great a anti-war story as was All Quiet on the Western Front! May GOD someday bless us all with a time without war and bloody conflict."
"From the director who brought us Air Force One, In the Line of Fire, and the Perfect Storm; this is definitely his best work of all.  Hands down. Carried by the performance of Jürgen Prochnow. This is perhaps the best war movie ever made.  I recommend the German version- even if you do not like subtitles it is worth it.  While the dubbed version is very well done, you still lose something when you take out the live German voices. A true masterpiece.  I showed this movie to an American WWII Navy Veteran, and he said that it was the most realistic portrayal of submarine warfare he had ever seen.  This from a man who was on a PT Boat in the same area part of the movie takes place.  This is a must see for anyone.  It shows the war from an entirely different perspective and it is very effective."
"This 1985 effort was re-issued with a longer VHS version in 1997 with surround sound and 60 minutes added to the original video, then put on DVD with 5.1 surround sound. All these improvements made a good movie even better.Considering most of this 209 minute film is done inside a U-boat, a submarine, it's very nicely filmed. Jurgen Prochnow, who plays the lead character - the captain of the boat - is a manly, rough-looking but compassionate human being who's always attention-getting. Just as interesting as him are the sounds as the noises from the boat echo through all the surround speakers.There are several tense, long drawn-out scenes, sometimes drawn out too long. In that respect, this movie might have been better had it been shorter and tighter. The language is ""crude"" in here in spots, so beware of that.I would recommend going with the German language track with English subtitles. The dubbed version has English spoken with a German accent and isn't easy to understand, anyway.....so stick with the way it was made and go with the subtitles if you don't understand German.In summary: a little long but generally moves at a decent pace and features a good ending to all of it. Recommended."
"This movie makes you realize that we are all human and wars are wrong. I never thought I'd say ""poor Nazis, poor men"". Watching the movie I found myself sympathizing the crew and wishing that they succeed. We all know (or most of us) that what the Nazis did was wrong and since the nazi regime established in Germany, all the movies were about killing the Nazis. I am glad I've seen this movie that is kind of.. from the nazi soldiers point of view but made in the American hero way. We are human and by definition we make mistakes, we hurt nature, we hurt the animals and we hurt each other. Before we hate someone we should think twice. For all the SF fans who may read this I recommend ""Enemy Mine"" (1985), it's the same message and also a great movie."
"I find the most intriguing aspect of this movie is the way, no matter where you are from, you end up pulling for these guys and hope they make it. I am not a veteran of any war, and not old enough for WW2, but my dad fought against the Axis and they were his mortal enemies, but this movie shows how young boys are just the cannon fodder of wars, while the men who started it were the real enemy, the real evil. These were kids that just wanted a lady at their side and a bottle of booze with them, as were all soldiers from any army. We, America, Great Britain, France etc., fought the Nazis, not Germany, not the people, certainly not the kids. I actually was saddened by the British raid at the end of the movie, even though Britain was an ally and to this day one of my country's closest friends. A great many of the soldiers and seamen, on both sides, weren't good guys or bad guys, just brave kids who did what they were told to do. One day maybe the men who start these things will end up in a cramped, stinking U-boat, and see first hand what their actions lead to. Anyway, I can't believe how much I pulled for ""the enemy""."
"This movie is a breaking point at Wolfgang Peterson's career .. it gave him a guaranteed 1st class ticket to Hollywood.whatever I say will never do this movie justice but I'll give it a try anyway.The acting was wonderful . especially by Jürgen Prochnow ..Watching this timeless masterpiece .. bringing WW2 to life is amazing .. how realistic can movies be? This movie captures even the spirit of WW2 .. Hitler .. The Third Reich .. everything.Germans built the best submarines in the world .. so, no wonder that they made the best submarine movie.This movie is lengthy but enjoyable & exciting.The music is wonderful.What else can I say? .. it is a masterpiece! .. two thumbs up! ..Just watch it .. you wont regret it."
"In this superb drama, we get into the lives of the crew of a German submarine. It is a small submarine, and their individual lives are melded into the claustrophobic constricted world in which they live. Every action has a reaction. Everything is done with the knowledge that a single slip up will lead to their destruction. They face a series of death defying maneuvers and escapes, losing a little of themselves whenever they survive. The war is the enemy, and these men would have meant nothing to those in power. As with most wars, we redefine the value of human life and put others ahead of the common man. The terror of each moment, each challenge, is magnified. They probably don't know what it is for except someone has told them it is important.I will not spoil the conclusion, but I will say that it is apt and arbitrary, just as their lives have been. This is a really effective film because it doesn't allow the audience to relax for even a moment. When it's over, we want out as much as the guys on the boat."
"Adapted from a mini-series, Das Boot ranks not just as one of the best war films, but one of the best suspense films of all time.Apart from some scene-setting at the start, Director Wolfgang Peterson centres all the action on the U-boat itself. The crew are cut off, with only the pings of sonar and the creaks from the hull to connect them to the outside world. They are trapped in a cramped, claustrophobic tube, a million miles from the cavernous interiors normally portrayed in submarine films. This is a submarine where people sleep 2 to a cot; where supplies litter the interior; where water sluices across the floor; where the sweat and fear is palpable.The crew are portrayed as professionals doing a job. These are not Nazi zealots, but cynical and hardened to their job. In one telling scene, the U-boat retreats from a recently torpedoed convoy, dooming its crew to certain death. Jurgen Prochnow's restrained performance shows that he has no choice, and that this choice is not a happy one. The only Nazi zealot amongst the crew (an SS intelligence officer and ex-Hitler Youth leader) is soon subdued and eventually proves his worth. (The other officers tease him by singing along to Allied crowd-pleasers like ""A long way to Tipperary"").The photography is superb, with a steadicam ranging up and down the sub in a way that conveys just how small and cramped it is.There are some standout set-pieces, where the submarine is under depth-charge attack from British destroyers. These rank as some of the most suspenseful sequences every committed to film - expertly acted, edited, and with breath-taking sound design. You will share in the crew's horror as the U-boat plummets to the bottom, with rivets popping and engines dead.The film spends a remarkable amount of time on character development. The clean-cut crew soon become haggard and tense; one key character snaps and derelicts his duty, risking court-martial; there is a sense of what each crew member has lost in the war. There is a jarring sequence where the U-boat sneaks into a neutral port to resupply from a German merchant vessel, and these gaunt and dirty ghosts are invited to a feast; their contempt for the self-satisfied merchant officers is palpable.There are few weaknesses. The visual effects don't match up to the rest of the production and are occasionally distracting. The ending is abrupt and rather shocking.Not just a must-see, but a film that bears repeated viewings."
"I've recently been to the Bavaria Filmstudios in Munich and entered the real 'Boot' that Petersen shot this film in. When you're inside for more than five minutes you forget that you're not inside a real sub. It's that kind of detail that allows Petersen's camera to float freely through the ship. There simply isn't a bad angle in there.
The atmosphere inside also enhanced the performance of the actors. A lot of them deliver their career highlight in Das Boot.Other reviewers mentioned all the great things about this film. I agree with them. It is one of the anti-war-films with the most impact I know. It's not important for the viewer whether the soldiers are Germans, Americans or Japanese. War is the same for everybody. We can relate and feel with the mariners. Few films are that intense, suspenseful and claustrophobic.There's just one thing I'd like to add:
The climax of the film shows the whole futility of war better than any other I can remember. I'm not going to spoil anything (If you've already seen it you will remember). When I saw it first I couldn't help but feel cheated. But then I thought about it and now I think that this ending just adds to the realism of the film. It is a punch in the face that shows that in war there are no heroes and emphasizes the complete senselessness of it all.If you haven't seen this already, stop reading now and watch it. For the more patient viewer I also recommend the 4.5 hour long tv mini series."
"I am loss for words. Almost. This movie was brilliant and amazing. Luckily I managed to find the uncut version, which ran well over three hours long. I don't regret it. The film captures realism in the lives of many men on board a submarine. In 1942, thousands of U-boats were dispatched in the treacherous waters, at war with the Germans. This is the story of just one of the 1200 U-boats. Of these boats, over half were either destroyed, or never found. I won't spoil how this tale will end, all I can say is you're in for a trip. Wow! This was one hell of a movie! The performances were outstanding, the visual effects were spot on, and the final scene will be remembered for years to come. I guarantee it. So their perils get a little repetitive, and the story seems to drag a few minutes here and there, however, this is all done is the name of realism, which it captures successfully. The movie is meant to show us the boredom, the fear, the tension, and the pressures these men have to endure on such a stressful mission. All this enveloped in a very emotional, and disturbingly difficult film to watch. I normally don't feel many films earn a 10 star review, especially what's been handed to us over the years, but this one actually exceeds the 10 star mark, as I found several, if not, ALL attributes passing flying colors with this. Very well made, and I can go out of my way to say that this is not only the best submarine movie ever made, but probably will ALWAYS be the best submarine movie ever made. I've done some research, and found that there's several movies about submarines made that people can point fingers, and laugh at, especially those that know the ins and outs of how they work. Meaning, real life sailors! Real life sailors have confirmed that this is the only film ever made that will show you what life was really like, the horrors that occur above and below the waters. Everything was handled very well. What was amazing was how they were able to give us the feel of the claustrophobic atmosphere. I could go on and on about the best of the best on this movie, but why when you can just watch it for yourself? Rent this movie! It has to be seen to be believed ( and more importantly, respected.)"
"This has to be one of the best, if not the best psychological studies of war in a movie. The tension, tedium, and coarseness all work so well together that you can actually feel for the crew. The viewer get a close and personal feel for what these crews went through, how they felt, and what they had to go through to serve their insane Government. Wolfgang Peterson did a fantastic job directing this movie, and the cast was top notch to carry this out the way it needed to be. Do not expect a high action movie, it has its action, but that is not what this movie is. Be ready for a movie that is long, drawn out, and sometimes tedious to watch, it is well worth every minute of it. Be ready for a no thrills movie that shows you what hell was like in submarine warfare, in WWII. I wish we had something like this for the American Submariners in WWII."
