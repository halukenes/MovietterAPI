Reviews
"The archetypal action film, Seven Samurai is also one of the richest works to ever be committed to celluloid. Each of its characters is extraordinarily realized; each has his or her own arc, his or her own vital part to play in the film's slow progression towards its dramatic finale. Typically, Kurosawa has put the film together using an exceeding degree of artistry; each and every shot, each action sequence, is exquisitely composed; and yet none seems contrived or out-of-place within the overall fabric of the work. Everything is beautifully conceived and in focus, both literally and figuratively.When watching Seven Samurai, movie lovers will immediately recognize that several of its key elements can be readily detected in countless similar films made during the last half-century. The audition scenes, in which several samurai are recruited for the difficult task of defending a farming town from a group of bandits, strikes a particularly familiar chord, as do those showing the samurai training the lowly villagers to fight and use weapons. Indeed, the theme of a highly experienced group of ""tough guys"" taking up the cause of the disenfranchised has become something of an action film cliche, portions of which echo throughout the American western, as well as its progeny (think The Dirty Dozen, The Road Warrior or even television's The A Team).But what really stands out in Seven Samurai are its characters. They run the gamut, from elder teacher to hopeful youth, stoic warrior to undisciplined brigand. Kurosawa even finds room for a youthful romance, not to mention the mix of poor and beleaguered townspeople he depicts within the setting of the town. Perhaps its no wonder the enemy bandits are virtually faceless-- there is so much conflict and passion present within the group of protagonists, the villains need not be more than a vague threat. Through it all Kurosawa never forgets who these people are and where they stand in comparison to one another. Obviously, the samurai are, for the most part, samurai, while the townspeople are merely peasants, lacking even in funds to pay their noble defenders. Kurosawa deftly illustrates these class differences by having one peasant fear horribly for the honor of his daughter, who he suspects will be lured by the wealth of the samurai; and also by giving us one samurai who is no samurai at all, but merely a peasant himself whose own farming village was in his youth destroyed by marauding warriors. The film thus wraps a a portrait of class conflict in a cloak of solidarity. The samurai unite to defend the poor peasants, but the ending is not exactly happy for them. Nor are the peasants completely honorable. We learn, for instance, that they have in the past murdered defeated samurai and looted their bodies, and it becomes apparent late in the film that their claims of poverty are perhaps not as truthful as at first seemed apparent.So why do the samurai defend them so valiantly? For honor? For love of adventure? The answer to this question is left intentionally vague; it is up to each viewer to draw his or her own conclusions. It is to the film's credit that it forces such questions upon us while never allowing them to cause the motivations of its characters to seem untrue.Modern viewers will find the action sequences of Seven Samurai to be restrained. There are, for instance, no ""Gladiator"" or ""Braveheart"" moments in which limbs are visibly hacked off, blood flies and speakers pound with booming audio. But the action is wonderfully filmed and there is some early use of slow motion to accentuate key moments. The 3 1/2 hour running time may also deter some, but I find the length to be one of the film's charms; it takes its dear sweet time in exposing its riches, and no single moment feels underdeveloped or awkward. Don't miss it.10/10"
"Having seen Kurosawa's Seven Samurai at least 10 times, I still see something new every time I watch it.  I don't see how anyone, especially a non-Japanese, could possibly absorb this movie in less than 2 or 3 viewings. I've always been surprised at how each of the 7 samurai can make such an individual impression on you even if you can't understand Japanese. Although Toshiro Mifune is often considered the star, for me its Takashi Shimura who is firmly fixed at the center of the movie.  He is the guiding moral force from the moment of his appearance in the film and can capture the viewer's attention in a way similar to Alec Guinness.  Mifune's character can be annoying at first in his loutish behavior, but he gains stature throughout the film and eventually becomes a unifying force second only to Shimura.  Minoru Chiaki as the woodcutting samurai provides a subtle humor and the others look to him to boost their morale.  Daisuke Kato is another very familiar face to Japanese movie fans and provides an excellent foil to Shimura as his second in command.  Yoshio Inaba is very good as the samurai who is recruited by Shimura and quickly builds a strong rapport with him.  Seiji Miyaguchi as the ""expert"" warrior, dedicated to honing his skill as a swordsman is a very low key yet likeable character.  Ko Kimura as the young hero-worshipping samurai, as well as the love interest of the peasant girl, wishes to be a great samurai, but is easily distracted by a field of flowers or a pretty face.  The peasants in the village being defended by the samurai each have their own defining characteristics as well.In addition to the wealth of interesting characters, we have a terrific action plot--the defending of the village from 40 marauding bandits by the small troop of samurai--, and a more subtle secondary plot involving the distrust of the samurai by the villagers due to the historical interaction of these two classes in feudal Japan.  All of these plot and character elements are woven together into an unforgettable epic, but, at least in my opinion, its not one that can be absorbed in a single sitting.  While it's similar in this sense to another of my favorite epics, Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West, it is more complex given the number of characters.I can only say that your patience with this film will probably be well rewarded if you take the time to give it multiple viewings.  You will also have the pleasure of seeing many of the samurai and villagers pop up in other Kurosawa films and films of other Japanese directors.  If you like Mifune and Shimura in this one, catch them in Stray Dog and Drunken Angel in very different settings and parts.  This one is 10 out of 10 without a doubt."
"Though its biblical connotation is not the happiest one (""Seven Deadly Sins"") number seven, omnipresent in our (7 days a) weekly cycles, seems to have been a lucky number in the world of cinema. Several very solid and some great movies have this number in their title, starting with gag-wise incredibly inventive Seven Chances (1925) from genius of silent era Buster Keaton, Frank Borzage's silent version of classic melodrama 7th Heaven (1927), Walt Disney's first feature-length animated movie, Snowhite and Seven Dwarfs (1940), recognized as an instant classic and remained so ever after, Stanley Donen's ear-pleasing, eye-riveting musical Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954), staged in western milieu, with the breathtaking barn-raising dance sequence, Ingmar Bergman's literally Death-defying, answers-to-reasons-for-human-misfortune-seeking masterpiece, Det sjunde inseglet (""The Seventh Seal"") (1957), Billy Wilder's Seven Year Itch (1957), a clever and amusing first collaboration with incomparable Marilyn Monroe (a worm-up for their second, bigger if not decisive step in taboos-of-the-motion-picture-production-code-breaking, brilliant comedy Some Like It Hot (1959)), up to newer examples like David Fincher's disturbing drama Se7en (1995), one of the finest Hollywood movies of the 90's, as well as Tsui Hark's Chat Gim (""Seven Swords"") (2005), a stunner in the department of action sequences from the often under-appreciated genre Wuxia, originating from Chinese literature.However, even among such illustrious examples of movie-making par excellence, one movie holds a special place, Shichinin no samurai (""Seven Samurai"") (1954) from the legendary Japanese director Akira Kurosawa. This movie doesn't seem to lack anything that an avid movie consumer, in particular samurai genre admirer, might be wishing for.It is not easy to say anything new about the one of the most analyzed and scrutinized movies of the film history. Nevertheless, and despite being eventually only repeated, it shall be mentioned that movie has a simple but very engaging story - a group of peasants, representing a village, periodically stormed by gang of bandits, looting their crops and other possessions, hires several wandering ronins (masterless samurai) to help them protect the village - not without lucid observations on the possibility of social interaction between members of different classes during the almost seven centuries long feudal history (1185-1868) of Japan.Characterization is excellent, and though having clear stand-outs in samurai's true leader, Kambei (Takashi Shimura), a wise tactician of the exceptional valor, as well as in the exuberantly uncontrollable Kikuchiyo (Toshiro Mifune), messy in its appearance and blustering in its manner, yet, a peasant descendant himself, making for a perfect link between the samurai and their employers, all other samurai are memorable, as well, sporting wide variety of personality traits. In joining the village protection campaign, hired for nothing more than a regular meal for as long as providing a service, thus primarily hoping to finally fill their starving stomachs, each one of them was driven by different additional motives, whether they were challenged to test their bravery, fighting skills and tactics, seeking for excitement and recognition, trying to regain pride and glory of the past days, just reaching out for that human touch (cross-class communication, even mere courtship promising relationship) they have been deprived of, or simply interested in its noble cause.Together with true highlights in realistically choreographed battle scenes, showing all the pain and misery of excessive violence on the reverse of heroism, that even defenders cannot avoid resorting to, sadly announcing inevitable decline of the samurai and their ways exposed to new artless technology, unbecomingly dying ambushed by distant shots from the muskets, while ingloriously stuck in the village muds... it all makes for a compelling narrative.Though triumphant in their common task to protect the village, unlikely alliance between samurai and peasants is ultimately doomed to fail. In the short run, it gives expected results, but in the long run, does not stand the chance. That is so loudly, although in fact silently, expressed at the end, when peasants don't even care to join the surviving samurai in their mourning over the fallen ones, not even giving the last well deserved respect to those who have helped them withstand fierce attacks, prevail and ultimately defeat bandits, and, in doing so, most of them given their lives. Peasants simply continue with their daily chores, while surviving samurai have to leave the village, like they have never existed, sadly symbolizing their ultimate destiny: slowly but surely stepping off the future pages of the history books.Seven Samurai, the movie, is rightfully considered as the one that has redefined samurai film in its contemporary perception, and dawned almost two decades long string of successes, instantly becoming the brightest example of thus revived, uniquely provocative and entertaining sub-genre, unknown as such in the country of its origin, classified there within a broader genre, jidaigeki (a period drama, often describing events from pre-modern era of the Edo period, marking the governance of Tokugawa shogunate (1603-1868), relatively peaceful times for Japan's long history of civil wars, as opposed to gendaigeki, films treating contemporary matters), and by IMDb standards, as an action drama, occasionally historical, when based on real events.Originating in the Edo-era Far East, it has inspired equally successful, star-studded (Y. Brynner, S. McQueen, C. Bronson, J. Coburn, E. Wallach, R. Vaughn, H. Buchholz, B. Dexter) Hollywood remake, The Magnificent Seven (1960), conveniently situated in the U.S. West of 19th century, as well as three lesser sequels, Return of... (1966), Guns of... (1969), and ...Ride! (1972)."
"I discovered 16 of Kurosawa's best known films before returning to the one which is commonly thought of as his masterpiece. Seven Samurai is unlike any other grand classic ever produced. It's basic plot can be summed up in a single easy sentence, yet its refinement and execution rival any movie you've ever seen. The premise: in chaotic 16th century Japan, as marauders threaten raid villages, one village hires samurai to defend it from a group of bandits. Yet Kurosawa (also co-writer) developed these characters in a way unheard of for what might pass as an epic action film. To its astonishing credit, through all of its 207 minutes running time, Seven Samurai never falters or bores. And if the script is a marvel in itself, the acting and production design than derive from it are nothing short of superlative. It is said that Kurosawa forced the villagers (from supporting role to mere extra) to live together as a community during production and be their characters, each and every one of which he had drawn out specifically. This unusual technique gave Seven Samurai a feel of authenticity unparalleled in film history.The samurai themselves are so richly given life to in the screenplay that little more would have been needed to make them memorable characters, yet the main cast pay off at every turn, and though every one of the seven main actors give in perfect performances (never as I had feared before watching it do you confuse them, even in the chaotic battle scenes), two immortal roles have a particularly resounding effect: Takashi Shimura (Kambei Shimada), who plays the leader of the ragged band of samurai, gives his sage and venerable warrior a god-like intensity that makes the magnetic charisma of his character unquestionable. One of the easiest leaders to root for in all the history of film-making. Stealing the show however, albeit by a very thin margin, is longtime Kurosawa favorite coworker Toshiro Mifune (Kikuchiyo) as the rogue seventh, the black sheep of the herd, giving the bravura ultimate performance of a lifetime paved throughout with great roles. The story follows them and the villagers, equally nuanced and developed, through their encounter, training, eventual bonding and the big inevitable fight for survival. Unlike subsequent very successful remakes (i.e. Magnificent Seven), seven Samurai transcended excellency by having many layers (nothing or no one is white or black: everything exists in shades of gray) and thus being very real and human. Even without the menace, its interpersonal dynamics would have made it perfect human drama, subtle, balancing comedy, intensity, realism, drama and a deep philosophy with astonishing ease, yet the menace does materialize and thus Seven Samurai unleashes its violence in a series of action scenes crafted with such vision and ingenuity as has ever reached an action film (the frenetic battle scenes at the end rather evoke Saving Private Ryan in their relentlessness).In the end, what made this into solid gold was, at the core, Akira Kurosawa, who would, despite directing many further masterpieces (Throne of Blood, Yojimbo, Red Beard, Dersu Uzala, Kagemusha, Ran), would never top this one. Throughout his life, Kurosawa kept confirming his status as perhaps the greatest director ever. If so, Seven Samurai is the ultimate proof of that truth. One of the very best films ever made and personal all-time favorite."
"Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece... The Japanese equivalent to Orson Welles' Citizen Kane.. I say it's just as good, if not even better. Not only Kurosawa's most well known film, but the most widely recognized Japanese film ever made. This movie will forever be known as a milestone in motion picture history.The story revolves around a village that has become a group of bandits' common looting and pillaging ground. The villagers cannot take this any longer and go to town to hire warriors to defend the village from the bandits. A wandering ronin, Kambei (Takashi Shimura) agrees to help them and with his help, they recruit six others that agree to take the job. The seven samurai teach the villagers how to stand up to the bandits and defend themselves. Finally, when the time comes, they engage in a fierce battle with the attacking bandits.About once in every 20 years or so we are gifted with a film that has the meaning, power, richness, and technique that The Seven Samurai has. I cannot urge anyone enough to see this film, the images are true cinematic poetry rich with so much emotion that I cannot even describe them in words. If you have never seen any of Kurosawa's works, then please see Seven Samurai... you will witness the true beauty, excellence and magic that the art form known as film is capable of."
"I've been on a Toho binge for a while now and for the most part the films have been enjoyable, especially those by Kurosawa. The earlier films were dark, bleak and unsettling viewing and therefore going into Seven Samurai I was of two minds. First I expected more of the same, in both quality and tone but then on the flipside at time of writing this is ranked as the 19th highest rated movie on IMDB which is incredible.My expectations were that it would be good, but that's about it. Seeing Takashi Shimura in the credits also confirmed my logic that this was going to at least be an entertaining three and a half hours.I was mistaken, Seven Samurai is not good............it's outstanding.Wonderfully crafted, perfectly scored, incredibly choreographed, well acted and beautifully written this is well deserving of it's high place and I would consider it nothing short of a masterpiece.If you check out my IMDB rating distribution it's very clear to see that getting anything higher than an eight is a rarity, this deserves it on so many levels.I didn't expect this level of quality further as generally I don't tend to agree with titles in the IMDB top 250, this however I do I thoroughly unconditionally agree.A masterpiece and essential viewing, I don't even need to give the premise of the movie in this review and must simply stress that this is film making mastery at its finest.The Good:Takashi ShimuraVery well shot for its timePerfectly craftedThe Bad:Nothing springs to mindThings I Learnt From This Movie:Akira Kurosawas should be a household name, not Bruckheimer or Bay!I'll put money down now that none of the remakes or movies heavily influenced by Seven Samurai comes close in quality"
"Story-telling at its finest, ""Seven Samurai"" is a terrific film not because of a handful of memorable scenes or lines, but rather because scene-by-scene, frame-by-frame, it tells an interesting story as well as it is possible to tell it.  The story and characters are developed carefully, and everything about the movie, from the settings and props to the musical score, is done carefully and expertly.Mifune grabs the attention in most of his scenes, and Shimura's more restrained character is a nice balance.  Those two have the best parts, but all seven of the samurai are memorable characters.  The sequence of events that collects the seven together occupies the first part of the movie, and forms a perfect foundation for the rest.  A few of the villagers are also portrayed nicely, although they are naturally overshadowed when the samurai are around.The story always moves along nicely, with many ups and downs.  It has enough unpredictability to keep you interested the whole time, without ever losing its credibility.  There is plenty of action, but there is also substance behind the action to give it more significance.  The only possible drawback is the long running time (you can always split it up into two installments, but it's more satisfying if you can watch the whole story through at once), but there is little that you could cut out, even if you wanted to.  It holds your attention the entire time with a good story and great technique, not by resorting to sensational or sordid details.This movie well deserves its reputation for excellence, and is one that everyone who appreciates classic cinema will want to see and enjoy."
"This is one of those great epic films that stands the test of time. I only saw this film for the first time in 2000, almost 50 years after it was made, and was astounded by it. It was an epic that truly told the whole story. Whereas most movies today manage to skirt around huge chunks of what would happen, this movie manages to show them all, and not in a boring way. The samurai don't even reach the village in danger until more than 30 minutes into the film, all that time being spent getting to know each of the characters and the motivation and history behind them. We get to truly learn what it takes to be a samurai, and what truly sets them apart. By the time we arrive at the village we have become attached to some of the samurai in a very personal way, respecting each of them in their own way. The rest of the movie progresses as if it were a documentary, not a fictional film, where we see each and every piece of the grand puzzle that happens in this village. I can't recommend this film enough, though I must throw a disclaimer out that if you're not a fan of epic movies with subtitles you may not be as interested. It is a 3 1/2 hour long movie! But if you can find the time to sit down and watch it, I doubt you'll be very disappointed."
"Akira Kurosawa was and is considered the master of east-western film-making (in that he made his Japanese films accessible for fans of American westerns while still making the movies his country found popular), and out of the few Kurosawa movies I've had the pleasure of viewing (Hidden Fortress, Rashomon, and this) I'd have to say that while Rashomon is still my favorite, I nevertheless had a blast during this one. The story has become quite influential to filmmakers from the likes of John Sturges (The Magnificent Seven) to John Lasseter (A Bug's Life): a small village has been terrorized by bandits for far too long, amid times of civil war in the nation, and so on the advice of Grand-Dad, they decide to hire four - which soon becomes seven - samurai for the job. There's no money, just food and honor, even though the village isn't exactly pleased to have samurai back in their village. Each character is drawn and executed compellingly, though for my money Toshiro Mifune proves why he became one of Japan's most notorious film actors. His work as the brave, bold outcast of the seven is awe-inspiring practically all the way through, like the hero of a western that anyone can root for since he's a true rebel at heart within a group of men with a task at hand. Kurosawa directs his tale and main and supporting players like a grand composer, orchestrating a vivid story and extracting from great actors like Takashi Shimura (the old, wise Samurai), Ko Kimura (the disciple Samurai), Daisuke Kato (Schichiroji), and Mifune (Kikuchiyo, which isn't his real name) just the right touches of humanity, humor, tragedy, romance, and intensity. The overall intensity, by the way, isn't over-estimated; its long length (almost 3 1/2 hours) isn't distracting in the slightest since Kurosawa's editing and photography (the later helmed by Asakazu Nakai) are extraordinary. Not to compare the two films, but one thing I saw in common with Seven Samurai and a Lord of the Rings film is that, if anything else, it definitely isn't a boring experience. Along with a score by Fumio Hayasaka that gives the film just a bit more of a pulse, and a showdown that is relentless with excitement, this is one of the must-see action films for film buffs, or anyone with an serious interest in having fun with an epic."
"In 1954, Kurosawa made foreign film history with Seven Samurai. Everything about this film is just absolutely terrific. The film lasts around 3 1/2 hours, and every minute of it is unbelievable filmmaking. Kurosawa's blend of stellar craft, captivating cinematography, ravishing art direction, and unforgettable characters makes this one of the most intelligent films ever made. The first hour is devoted to devoloping the many four-dimensional characters which inhabit the film throughout. When watching the film, the audiece cares for, trusts, mourns and ultimately believes every single attribute the characters have. Samurai set up the way that many action films are made today; films like Predator and Alien still work within it's boundaries. The battle scenes are terrific and the fast-paced editing is ground-breaking. If people have a problem with subtitles and long movies, then see this and your opinions will change. The sheer filmmaking of Kurosawa will not disappoint. Also see Yojimbo and High & Low."
"This is my favorite Kurosawa film, the man was a true master of the cinematic arts.  If you have never seen a Kurosawa film definetly make this your first.  Though extremely long at about 3 1/2 hours it is well worth the time spent.To quickly summarize, a poor Japanese village hires 7 Samurai to protect it from being raided by bandits.  Don't get me wrong there is way more to it than that, I just dont want to give anything away.  This is an intense and emotional movie that hooks you from the first scene and keeps you on the line till it is all over.  The battle scene at the end is in true Kurosawa form.  The acting is outstanding by everyone involved from the main characters all the way down to the very last extra.  Of course the best way to see any film, especially a Kurosawa film is on the big screen if you are able to.  Beautifully filmed, in black and white, anyone familiar with Kurosawa's work has to wonder visually how much more gorgeous it could have been had Kurosawa had the option of color in 1954.The camera use is brilliant and every scene is balanced visually.  This film is also the first one to use ""the wipe"" as a way of changing from one scene to another.  This technique was later used by George Lucas in his Star Wars movies.  I would also recommend the DVD version that has the commentary option by the Japanese cinema expert if anyone is interested in a deeper understanding of the ""hows"" and ""whys"" of Kurosawa's film making.  Any man, woman, boy or girl who just wants to see a really, really great movie, THIS IS THE ONE!  An A+++ in my book."
"Donald Richie thought it was Kurosawa's finest, and suggested that it might the best Japanese film ever made. It is a film that rewards casual viewing and careful viewing and repeated viewing and viewing over time. Isn't that rather like a wonderful book, that rewards you every time you pick it up? I suppose that is the definition of greatness. How was this greatness achieved? (This is not a rhetorical question. It truly astonishes me how this film creates meaning...cutting across all boundaries of nationality, language, and culture to become a meaningful personal experience for those who view it). This creation of greatness may be a mystery, but we can point to the some features of the film's excellence: The artistic achievement: The music, the cinematography, the extensive set design, the editing and the acting in the service of a moving story all conspire to create a world that becomes ours on a deeply personal level. It is a film which influences later films and filmmakers. The narrative achievement: Based on an original concept of Kurosawa's which began as a ""day in the life"" documentary of a samurai's existence, Kurosawa developed the idea into this breathtaking film of samurai who save a village. This simple but complexly nuanced human story involves us in different social classes in an historical framework. We come to know individual peasants and samurai, and feel that we know significant things about them, their motivations, hopes and fears.The achievements of the actors: These are characters you will love, people you need to have in your life: the characters of Kyuzo, Heihachi and the unforgettable Bokuzen Hidari as a bewildered peasant..! Takeshi Shimura, as the leader of the samurai, Gambei, is the embodiment of wisdom, and calm in the storm. And, saying that Toshiro Mifune has star power is like saying the noonday sun sheds a little warmth. Toshiro: It's the cut of his jawline when he asks the village patriarch, ""Got a problem, grandad?"", and the most charming look of confusion and embarrassment playing over his face when he is told by Heihachi that he is the triangle on the samurai flag. It's his energy, speed and agility and power and intelligence. Mifune sniffing out the fuse of a gun in the woods, bouncing through the brush half-naked in an abbreviated set of armor, or carrying his ridiculously oversize sword on one shoulder, Mifune crying over a baby, and the incomparable scene of his embarrassment that turns to rage when Mifune accuses the samurai of creating the farmer's condition. Toshiro Mifune represents with extraordinary physicality the spirit of a man desperate to prove his worth: Mifune's got the animal sexuality, the physical response to emotional situations, the expressive face, the humorous and varied vocalisms to make us feel deeply what his character experiences: his struggles, his growth.(His drunken burblings as the last ""samurai"" to audition are nothing short of hilarious, and his ""fish singing"" is eerie and funny, too...also the grunted ""eh?"" that he often uses to show confusion, and the ""heh"" of disgust..such wonderful sounds, and so expressive!) Mifune's acting is wild and alive, even more than 50 years after the film's original release. Takashi Shimura: You will trust him with your life. His great, open heart, his mature calm, his honesty and compassion make him one of the greatest of all samurai on film.Fumio Hayasaka's music: Kuroasawa was lucky to have such a brilliant composer as collaborator. Themes introduce characters, and the samurai theme is surprising and memorable. If you have viewed the film, chances are, the samurai theme is playing in your mind with just a mention of the music. Hayasaka's music is muscular and nuanced: creating humor, or a counterpoint to the action, or deepening our sympathy for and understanding of the characters. Muraki's scenography: There is no doubt that the places shown in the film are real. The achievement of Kurosawa's longtime collaborator provide a real world for the action.The filmography is ground-breaking: the multiple cameras, slow-motion and attention to light and composition make each frame worthy of an 8X10 glossy. How can individual moments of such beauty be sustained throughout the movement of the film? It is an astonishing feat. And, best of all, no image degenerates into interior design or vacuous prettiness...everything forwards the movement of the cinematic experience. When the film ends, we feel as if we have lived it! It is with great respect and humility that I offer my thanks to the memory of Mr. Kurosawa. His great work leads us to treasure humanity and its struggles, to develop our own abilities to feel compassion, encourages us to try to make good choices, to be socially and morally responsible, to embrace life."
"Well, if you haven't seen Seven Samurai then you're not really  qualified to call yourself a film fan, basically. One of the most  influential movies of all time, that still holds up extremely well  nearly 50 years later.  Akira Kurosawa's epic tale of heroism and barbarism set the standard in  so many ways it's hard to imagine that any modern film does not show  its influence in some way or other. A great script, great characters,  mostly great acting, splendid cinematography and action sequences that  wrote the book about how these things should be filmed. Even now, after  so many have tried to imitate or beat it, Seven Samurai remains a  totally gripping 3.5 hour experience.  Akira Kurosawa is one of the gods of Cinema - men who seem to have been  born to make films, who have it in their blood. People like Alfred  Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, King Hu and Steven Spielberg, who make it  look easy... who so obviously ""get it"". In this pantheon, Kurosawa is  perhaps the daddy of them all, however, and Seven Samurai is one of his  finest moments.  The scale of the production is remarkable - to undertake making such an  epic in post-war Japan was a feat in itself. The cast of dozens of  inhabitants of a village specially built for the movie, the 40 bandits  and their horses, all the costumes, the armour, the weapons. Few  directors could have brought all of this together and still paid such  attention to the smallest of details in script and scene. Credit must  go to the team Kurosawa worked with too, I presume   The movie's setup became the template for many movies to follow, the  most recentl example that comes to mind being the excellent Korean  period movie MUSA (The Warrior), for example. A motley band of  characters is assembled and placed in a situation where the odds are  seemingly stacked against them, and each gets there chance to really  shine, prove themselves and become something more than a normal man.  Kurosawa's Samurai movies all share a little bit in common, which is  the depiction of the Samurai as some noble beast, different from the  common and pathetic rabble of ordinary man. In Seven Samurai the  farmers are a base lot, cowardly, selfish, vain, pathetic and  treacherous. How he found actors with such miserable looking faces is a  mystery in itself. In contrast, the Samurai embody all the qualities  that humanity would generally like to believe define it (us). Brave,  righteous, honest, strong and heroic. Toshiro Mifune's character stands  in the middle and represents this difference - perhaps meant to suggest  that mankind can strive to rise above his flaws, but mostly suggesting  to me that the common man is basically a mess and we should learn to  respect our betters. Kurosawa was definitely not a socialist, unless  I'm mis-reading him wildly.  I'm sure many out there wonder, does a 50 year old black and white  movie about Samurai really have any interest or relevance to us in the  21st century? The answer is a definite ""Yes!"". Seven Samurai shows us  what cinema can be, what cinema is *meant* to be. It is moving picture  as art in a way that the multiplex-fillers of today cannot possibly  claim to be. It's a film that satisfies on many different levels, and  still provides a bench mark which today's film makers could and should  use to evaluate their own contributions. True, few out there will ever  be able to claim they've made a film that rivals Seven Samurai in scope  or beauty, but this *is* what every director should aspire to! The sad  thing is, I just can't see a project like this ever coming out of the  Hollywood studio system, where art is just another commodity and  marketing is the new god"
"Interesting, warm and , what's the most important, meaningful story accompanied with great actors and deep characters. I loved it."
"It is hard to know exactly where to begin when talking about a film of such utter quality.  What must be said at the start is that ""The Seven Samurai"" is flawless.  It's characters are brought to life by some of the finest and most committed acting I have ever seen. It is a compelling story of courage, duty, honor, respect and change.I could echo Roger Ebert's commentary, in which he noted that Kurosawa's film set the standard for the modern action film. It was he notes the first film to assemble a team of hardened men to undertake a mission.  But I say read Eberts review if you want to get his take.I have watched the film several times and what is truly amazing about ""The Seven Samurai"" is the way in which Kurosawa choses to tell his tale, which is, I think, truly innovative and subtle.Growing up on action fare as we have ""Seven Samurai"" should really hold no magic for us.  We have the formula (in many forms) before.  Countless times. However it is not old to us and magic it carries. I make the case (now anyway) that this comes largely from Kurosawa's knack,  his amazing gift, for photographic composition.  Most filmmakers today in the action genre have some flare for flashy cinematography.  We get sharp angles, dramatic poses (most favorably lighted), and fast cuts.  I guess this is to involve us in the high emotion of the situation.  But Kurosawa has patience and while I think he gave the blocking of his shots, and their composition a great deal of thought, it comes across as if he did not.  His camera moves as though it were simply following the characters through the story.  The camera work in ""Seven"" is so much more subtle and so much more compelling than almost any action fare today.  His camera allows, we the viewer, to be, at various times, all of the major characters in the film.Toshiro Mifune's emotional explosion at his ""fellow"" Samurai is probably the most obvious example of this.  He gets up and at first appears to agree with the Samurai sentiment that killing all of the villagers is a good idea, but when he turns and his anger is directed at them the scene and our place in it change.  We are no longer passive viewers watching heated exchange between two factions.  The angry Toshiro is yelling at us, looking down at us.  For we are looking up at him as his fellow samurai would see him. By the end of his out burst he angrily leaves the room but before he goes he turns slightly to look at us, but we don't see his face, for now we are looking (in one of the great shots of the film) at his feet.  The Samurai are ashamed and so are we because we identified with them at first and Kurosawa had the guts to show us that we are wrong to do so.I could go on, and on about his film, but I leave you with this, watch  it."
"Okay, call me an ignorant, uncultured, short-attention-span Yank if you wish, but I found this movie drawn-out and difficult to follow. It was indeed masterful storytelling with great character development, but the movie seemed to take quite a long time to get going, and when it did it was not the cinematic juggernaut I was expecting. Perhaps my expectations were too high? I don't think so. As of this writing Seven Samurai is at #6 in the all-time greatest movies list (and the only foreign-born film in the top 20), so I've obviously missed something big.This was by no means a bad movie; it was in fact a very good movie. However, all the really excellent movies I've seen have one thing in common - they carry you away with them. You get so involved with the story and characters that you feel like you know them personally. I did not get that here. Instead I kept trying to figure out what was going on, and why people were dramatically wailing and rolling on the ground in reaction to situations that didn't seem to warrant it. Is there perhaps a cultural difference that I'm not linking into? Am I over-analyzing it? I fully expected to walk away from this film wide-eyed and and muttering 'Wow. Just.wow' over and over (as I have with so many other films on IMDb's top 100), but instead I'm left to ponder why I seem to be the only one who's not getting it. I'd watch it again, but 3-1/2 hours is a long time."
"After getting used to shoot-em-up action flicks that rely more on computers than characters to sell tickets, watching a masterpiece such as this is very refreshing.  Most people just won't bother sitting down for over 3 hours to watch a foreign-language black and white film, and it's their loss.The story is relatively simple: a village of farmers is threatened by a gang of 40 bandits who will return to destroy their village when their crops are harvested.  The elder statesman of the village suggests hiring samurai to help defend the village.  The farmers then proceed to find seven samurai who return to the village and prepare for the final battle with the bandits.What is so great about this film is the character development.  It is intriguing to watch how the farmers and samurai relate to one another, and how the farmers learn to defend themselves instead of running and hiding as they do in the beginning of the movie.  The acting is excellent and every minute of the 3.5 hour film is used to develop each character, both the samurai and individual farmers.In a time where acting, plot, and character development and interaction take a back seat to special effects and cheesy, overused subplots, watching a film like this really makes you appreciate what a great action film is all about."
"This is a film to be studied, ruminated over, and revered.Its deft intertwining of epic action and complex characters allows to stand among few others in the category of 'a film to end all films'. Not only does it manage this mix superbly, but it's ability to create striking imagery allows it a sort of mythic quality, only enhanced by its plot.When it comes down to it, this film can stand with the legends of old as a story to be venerated.Thank you for your time."
"In the Sixteenth Century, in Japan, a poor village is frequently looted by armed bandits losing their crop of rice. Their patriarch Grandpa advises the villagers to hire a Ronin to defend their village. Four farmers head to town to seek out their possible protectors, but they just can offer three meals of rice per day and lodging for the samurai. They succeed in hiring the warming-hearted veteran Kambei Shimada (Takashi Shimura) that advises that they need six other samurai to protect their lands. Kambei recruits the necessary five samurai and the brave jester Kikuchiyo (Toshirô Mifune) and move to the village. After a feared reception, Kambei plots a defense strategy and the samurai start training the farmers how to defend their lands and families for the battle that approaches. In order to celebrate the milestone of 4,000 reviews in IMDb, I decided to watch again ""The Seven Samurai"", the most known masterpiece of Akira Kurosawa and among my Top-10 movies ever. As far as I recall, this was the first samurai movie that I have watched and it is still my favorite despite many other excellent movies. ""The Seven Samurai"" is a perfect movie: the story and screenplay are amazing, dividing the dramatic story in the recruitment, reception, strategy, training, harvest, romance and the final battle of the samurai in such a way that the viewer does not feel the 207 minutes running time. The direction of Akira Kurosawa is perfectionist as usual, and the choreography of the battle in the rain is extremely realistic. The acting is top-notch, highlighting Toshirô Mifune in a great shape, climbing trees, jumping and fighting in the role of a funny character. The cinematography, set decoration, costumes, lighting, everything is fantastic. In 1960, John Sturges remade this masterpiece with the western ""The Magnificent Seven"". My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Os 7 Samurais"" (""The 7 Samurai"")"
"Shichinin no samurai is a quintessential Kurosawa movie, and probably his greatest lagniappe to the world of cinema. Shichinin no samurai is a classic example of a profound character study well complemented by some ingenious direction and breathtaking cinematography. The world of cinema owes a colossal debt to the master movie-maker and plethora of his sui generis works such as this one. The movie depicts penury with sheer brilliance and uncanny resplendence. The inexorable resolve exhibited by the destitute villagers to fight the rapacious bandits can be inspiring even to the most pessimistic. The fidelity shown by the samurai to the villagers, each hired for a bowl of rice, accentuates the very essence of humanity. The movie's slow pace and its poignant background score enriches it with a sense of melancholy, thereby making it truly mesmerizing to watch. The entire cast has performed really well, taking care of the nuances with utmost precision and incredible conviction. Kurosawa's plaintive storytelling, coupled with his subtle brilliance, makes the movie a truly ineffable experience for the viewer. PS. Though not meant for everyone, the movie is sine qua non for cineastes and avid lovers of pristine cinema. It's also a great means to get acquainted with Kurosawa's oeuvre before exploring his more personal works like Rashomon, Ikiru, Ran, etc.http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/"
"Spoilers herein.We are all villagers through whose small world great artists pass.This is so clean, so effortless -- the originality is hard to appreciate because so much has been absorbed into the vernacular, but it still amazes.
My idea of genius is when someone can show you something you have never seen, but show it to you in such a way that you believe you knew it all along.This is a work of genius."
"I had the pleasure to see this film in America sub-titled and in a Japanese theater in it's original uncut version. This movie gets better every time.The action scenes are better than anything out there today and Kurosawa-san didn't have CGI to abuse.It was incredible seeing this mismatched group of men band together to risk their lives for people they didn't really respect. Great character build-up, brilliant action, superb tension, and even some flashes of comedy. And it's one of the DEEPEST action films that ever existed.It shows the duty the samurai dedicates himself to. That whether he likes it or not, there are some things he just MUST do.3&1/2 hours long but it seemed like 1&1/2. How many films can honestly say that today? Never looked at my watch once."
"This flick has everything.  Drama.  Comedy.  Action.  It's just a really fun ride, with some depth to it.What really amazes me is that it's 3.5 hours long, and there isn't a single scene where I feel it drags.  In fact, I like ""Seven Samurai"" more every time I watch it.Everything about this film (the script, score, acting, directing) is perfect.I'd give it an 11 if I could, but I guess I have to give it a 10."
"The great Akira Kurosawa's epic action masterpiece ""Seven Samurai"" is an entertaining and thoughtful war epic set in 19th century Japan. Replete with colorful well-realized characters, and sensitively portrayed social and class analysis, Kurosawa's film entertains on all levels. Although not as visually engaging as many of Kurosawa's later efforts, Seven Samurai's cinematography is still masterful, and well above most contemporary films.A farmer overhears some bandits talking about raiding his village as soon as the next harvest is ready and approaches an older Samurai master who is on the verge of retirement for help. The elder Samurai, recognizing the humility of the request and the dignity of the proposed work, takes up the cause and begins recruiting others for the defense of the village. He recruits five Samurai and takes on a young apprentice and a drunken, angry would-be Samurai avenger (Toshirô Mifune ... Kikuchiyo) as the sixth and seventh members of his newly established militia. The Samurai live among the villagers for most of a growing season, teaching them defense and discipline. In turn, the villagers - as fearful of the Samurai as they are in awe of them, hide away their daughters and some of their stores. As the inevitable crisis ensues, these two widely disparate classes of people learn to live and fight together to defend their homes and their crops.Kurosawa's film is as much social realism as it is martial historic fantasy. Their is also a steady supply of humor and an entertaining romance - both of which are relatively rare in this genre. In summary, Seven Samurai is one of those rare works of art which takes on a vast scope and sustains it with apparent facility.Highly recommended."
"This is a superior and enduringly popular film , considered to be a real classical movie .The film gets action in Western style , thrills , intrigue , human relationships , it's fun and entertaining . Kurosawa's vintage pic set in 16th century Japan , a small farming village beset by marauding attackers hires 7 professional Samurai to rid of the scourge. As a group of villagers go to the nearly town where find Kambei : Takashi Shimura , who has carried out a risked rescue of a baby taken hostage by a nasty bandit . As Kambei walks towards town a young samurai, Katsushiro : Kimura , asks to become his acolyte. Then the farmers ask Kambei to help defend their village; to their great joy, he accepts. Kambei, with Katsushiro's assistance, then enlists four samurai more from the city, . Kambei initially decides that seven masterless samurai , Ronin , would be necessary to recruit , and time is running short . The villagers beg him to take Katsushiro also and, with some prodding by the others, he agrees . A clownish samurai named Kikuchiyo : Toshirô Mifune , whom Kambei had rejected for the mission, follows them to the village at a distance , ignoring their protestations and attempts to drive him away. The team gradually come together and 7 Samurai , at last , one by one, each with distinctive skills and personality traits ; all of them to help a poor village against savage thieves .As Kambei and his buddies , each of whom comes for a different reason , must free a village attacked by heinous outlaws who are devastating the small location . All of them get a chance to redeem themselves . Later on , the bunch develops a plan to secure the villagers defend it against enemy attack .This is a magnificent picture by Akira Kurosawa starred by his ordinary actors Toshiro Mifune , and Takashi Shimura , being his international breakthrough one . Sweeping , dramatic , complex human drama with all the ingredients : suspense , action , comedy , character studio and many other things . Seven Samurai , the picture blends drama , violent fights , emotion , slaughters with high body-count and results to be pretty entertaining as well as thought-provoking . It is incredibly detailed vision in its own right , as the impact of the action and combats on this trail-blazing adventure film opened the floodgates for the huge numbers of samurai films and subsequent Spaghetti Westerns that made fortunes for their producers in the sixties and early seventies . Dramatically staged sword-plays occur on and off throughout the plot . The story is classic and traditional , following its interesting premise in subsequent remakes , rif-offs and sequels , including customary misfit band formed by an eclectic gang with diverse characters as well as speciality . Kurosawa took an elemental Western issue ¨good guys against bad guys¨ plot and turned it into a breathtaking classy which is still probably the best-know and one best Samurai film to come from Japan . At the time of its making it got a big success at the boxoffice around the world . Kurosawa's pacing is immaculate and allows for periods of calm in which to establish roles punctuated by viscerally thrilling burst of action . These culminate in the overwhelming climatic battle between the bandits and the samurai which ranks among the very nicest combat scenes ever put on movie . It is followed by several reboots and imitations . Standing out ¨The magnificent seven¨ by John Sturges . Unlike Sturges' remake in 7 Samurai the roles grow originally from the action and they are not conveniently established by star-casting , like in the American film formed by big actors as Yul Brynner , Charles Bronson , James Coburn , Robert Vaughn , Brad Dexter , Elli Wallach . Very good acting by Toshiro Mifune as a valiant Samurai , as he is a harebrained but courageous young dominating warrior , as well as Takashi Shimura as the intelligent and brave leader of the fabulous Samurai . This one made an international star out of Toshiro Mifune .This fiercely-charging , uncompromising picture was compellingly directed by Akira Kurosawa and being exhibited with subtitles or dubbed .After working in a wide range of genres, Kurosawa made this awesome film . And available in a big number of versions of varying length , all too long . Kurosawa's previous and subsequent years saw the low-key , touching Living (1952) , this great epic The seven samurais (1954), the barbaric , fascinating Shakespeare adaptation Throne of blood (1957) , a Macbeth's version , a masterful rendition that transports the story to Medieval Japan , and a fun pair of samurai movies Yojimbo (1961) and Sanjuro (1962) , and Rashomon , often credited as the reason the Academy created the ""Best Foreign Film"" category. When this film was released internationally to rave reviews, many speculated that Akira Kurosawa was influenced by Citizen Kane (1941) in the element of flashbacks that ultimately provide conflicting accounts of events. However, Kurosawa didn't even see Orson Welles's film until several years after . Rashomon won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival, and first revealed the richness of Japanese cinema to the West.Yet , there was a quieter side to Kurosawa's nature , expressed most succinctly on Living , The Lower Depths and especially the medical drama Red Beard . After a lean period in the late 1960s and early 1970s, though, Kurosawa attempted suicide . Other important movies were : The idiot based on Feodor Dostowieski , Drunken Angel , Scandal , A quiet duel , Tiger's tale , High and low . He survived, and made a small, personal, low-budget picture with Dodes'ka-den (1970), a larger-scale Russian co-production Dersu Uzala (1975) an epic tale of adventure in turn-of-the-century Siberia and , with the help of admirers Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas, the samurai tale Kagemusha (1980), which Kurosawa described as a dry run for Ran (1985), an epic adaptation of Shakespeare's ""King Lear"" . He continued to work into his eighties with the more personal Akira Kurosawa's Dreams (1990), and Madadayo (1993) and Rhapsody in August . Kurosawa's films have always been more popular in the West than in his native Japan, where reviewers have viewed his adaptations of Western genres and authors with suspicion , but he's revered by American and European film-makers, one of his least well-known films but most agreeable pictures is The Bad Sleep Well , a transposition of an Ed McBain detective novel , being remade many his pictures such as The seven samurais (1954), as The magnificent seven (1960),The Hidden Fortress (1958), as Star Wars (1977)as Yojimbo (1961) as For a fistful of dollars by Sergio Leone (1964), in fact Kurosawa's style was the biggest single influence on the Spaghetti Western sub-genre ; as his Samurai 'Western's were copied not only in America but also in Italy . Rating : 7.7/10 . Better than average . Well worth watching ."
"Being a young filmmaker, I am constantly trying to discover films that can teach me how to push the boundaries of my imagination. I also need to be inspired by the power of the human spirit. Furthermore, because of my struggles in the ""business"" of making film, I need to constantly be reminded of the poetry of making personal films even if they are epic by theme and nature.Seven Samurai provides me with all of the above. A simple but beautiful story that contains some of the most memorable characters and character combinations I've ever seen in film. The characters are so rich that you could devote an entire movie to each of them.I sat in awe as I watched it for the first time on a digitally restored version on DVD.  Criterion did an amazing job in its restoration of the film. If you ever get a chance please watch it on DVD, which contains a section which compares the original and restored versions. They showed a scene, which lasted no longer than a minute where they had to remove 3500 particles! The difference is amazing.When I watch Mifune on screen I think immediately of Kurosawa. When I think of two of them it immediately brings to mind other great collaborations; Fellini and Mastroianni (and Masina); Bergman and Von Sydow; Scorcese and De Niro. It's rare when you have the greatest actor and director working together at their genius peak. It's almost as if the two were one leading their cinematic cavalries on film, and somehow, neither of them could have been as great on their own.I also have to comment on Kurosawa's collaboration with his cinematographer Asakazu Nakai.  Even though the film is about the outcastes of the time, their camera captures the poetic beauty of humanity and nature working together.I went to Japan last year and I am now ashamed that I didn't visit Kurosawa's grave. I am indebted to his contribution to cinema and his influence on my dream."
"The great director wrote ""Seven Samurai"" as well as presiding over the filming, and most of the 'coups de cinema' are attributable to him alone. The film is rich in cinematic master-strokes, and these notes attempt a brief survey of just a few of them.Dust blows in beautiful whorls around the village houses.  The graves of the ancestors have been capped with stones to prevent wind-erosion, and they stand as pillars of earth when all around has been stripped by the wind.  The ancestors are permanent, but all else is ephemeral.  The graves of the samurai have no capstones, and already there are plumes of dust spiralling from them.  The samurai, like the bandits, will wash over the village and recede, but the village endures for ever. At the close of the film, Shino is starting to erase Katsushiro from her consciousness as she turns enthusiastically to the rice-planting, singing the village song with gusto.  The farmers have a sense of place, a relationship with the earth. The samurai are as free, and therefore as homeless, as the windblown dust.Village houses are manmade, but are open to nature.  They are the meeting-point of earth-spirit and human artifice.  Wild streamwater babbles through each home, and the latticework walls allow the air to sift through the building's fabric.  The farmers feel almost religiously about their houses, which lie beyond the village's natural defences.Kikuchiyo, psychologically the most interesting character, is played by Toshiro Mifune, Kurosawa's favourite actor.  A peasant by birth but a samurai by aptitude and inclination, Kikuchiyo straddles the caste division uneasily, not truly accepted in either community.  The episode of Kikuchiyo's drunkenness conveys his isolation cleverly.  The handheld camera suggests both his intoxication and, at a deeper level, his social and spiritual instability.  As he staggers about, he finds himself separated from the motionless, self-possessed samurai by the rails and slats of the room's structure.  He is the perennial outsider.What was a ghost town erupts into life, with great shots of the samurai running, and terrific crowd scenes. There is a moment of great dramatic power, in which we come to understand the suffering of Rikichi. Kikuchiyo has used his comic talent and his unique 'view from the bridge' to heal the rift of distrust between the two communities.The splendid musical score of Fumio Hayasaka marvellously augments the thematic scheme of the film.  A thousand other examples of excellence spring to mind - the unhorsed bandits, scampering like hunted rats, or the swathes of peasants with their bamboo spear stalks raised, like a bitter mockery of the harvest ...  ""Seven Samurai"" is a masterpiece, densely packed with images of astonishing power and beauty."
"This is simply one of the most perfect films I have ever sat down to watch. This is an epic of great scale and the cinematography is awesome. The acting is dead on and even the portrayl of the peasant villagers is graphic and perfect. Akira Kurosawa is simply one of the greatest directors and autuer film-makers that has ever lived. Kurosawa's film's hit you on a level you wouldn't expect and they take you for a ride that is unforgettable. This film has great atmosphere and you get to see the absolutely astounding Toshiro Mifune, simply the greatest Japanese actor of all time. Do yourself a favor and take a rainy afternoon and sit down to watch one of the most important films in cinema history."
"All I have to say is that I first saw this movie in an auditorium with about 150+ other first-year film students. It was required viewing for a class. I, as well as many other students I talked to then, were none too anxious to watch a 3 1/2 hour, foreign, nearly 50-year-old movie. I had only vaguely heard of Akira Kurosawa before.After the showing, I walked outside and it was like I was stuck in a daze. I didn't know what to do, I couldn't believe what I had just seen. This movie would eventually lead me to change the way I saw movies, and what constituted a great one. Now, about two years later I have seen nearly every single Kurosawa film (everyone I talked to that first saw this with me, have ALL done so, it will happen to you if you watch and enjoy this film). I have also seen this movie about ten more times, each time introducing it to someone who has never seen a Kurosawa film before. Everyone I showed it to, regardless of their movie taste, has at the least been entertained by it.
What amazes me though is how the 10th viewing of this film was just as powerful and exciting as my very first. I know no other movie I can say that of."
"The movie is good and well made, sort of archetypal in its representation. Revealing 3 types of people. The peasant, the samurai and the barbarian. You could say that it is moral in the sense that the good guys win. However I say it's somber because the noble samurai's don't get any goodness other then the ability to be of service, their pleasures are short lived and quick just like their intense battles. Whereas the peasants after victory will surely enjoy a long enduring peace. Another thing apparent in this movie is class, some samurai deny serving peasants and that is the last we see of them. Some although the barbarians get destroyed for their cruelty others simply move to another location. What this movie could be summed up as is gaining good fortune if not the lowest of the low those most down to earth, gain freedom."
"The idea of watching a 3 and half hours japanese moovie -that was made less than ten years after WW2- made me think i would be bored and give up in the first hour.But i was so wrong and now i am happy that there are so many more moovies like this to watch, with the same director and actors."
"""There are people who criticize my work and say it is not realistic. But I feel that merely copying the outward appearance of the world would not result in anything real -- that is only copying. I think that to find what is real one must look very closely at one's world, to search for those things that contribute to this reality which one feels under the surface. The novels of Dostoevsky, Tolstoy and Turgenev show us what these things are. To be an artist means to search for, find, and look at these things; to be an artist means never to avert one's eyes."" (Akira Kurosawa)Writing about Kurosawa has always been a challenge for me. He's one of the greatest cinematic Gods, and is the guru of Japanese film for many of us. How can one describe his 'magnum opus', the greatest of all and the first actual samurai-picture. Seven Samurai is a grand, epic fresco about life and death, victory and defeat, glory and the loss of it; one can see that Kurosawa was infatuated by the very same themes, the greatest playwright of all, William Shakespeare was. Dealing with his own culture's taboos characterized Kurosawa's entire work but he drilled down deeper, neglecting historical or cultural limitations. He drilled down to pure emotion, to humanity and the depth of it.In the early 1950's Japanese films came to Europe for the first time, and its masters were instantly renowned for their unique style. French critic and film theorist, Andre Bazin wrote that the appreciation towards these films might just be first-time flush and fascination for exotic culture. But after he had seen about twenty Japanese films, he was sure it wasn't just that. There was something more. In 1954, when Akira Kurosawa had just finished his most ambitious film, European audiences and critics were thrilled once again. This was something completely new and, different from everything they had admired about Japanese cinema, for which we can give the credit to Mizoguchi's lyricism. Akira Kurosawa made a Japanese western; the very first samurai-film. It had the same elements American westerns did, and Seven Samurai can easily be compared with the finest films by John Ford.'Samurai' comes from the word; 'to serve', and samurais were servants. They were a class of their own in feudal Japan, and not until the end of the 17th century was the class removed. Even that samurais were servants they were part of the upper-class; they were used, not only to serve but, also to smash small peasant revolts. Samurais even had the right to kill a man who acted disrespectfully towards a representative of the samurai-class. Sometimes, due to boredom and poverty, samurais had to take smaller jobs without gaining much money, and this is exactly what happens in Kurosawa's Seven Samurai. But still the samurais do their job out of solidarity, with heart and talent.A group of bandits terrorize a small farmers' village due to which the village hires seven samurais to protect them. Through hard work and precise strategies the samurais, together with the peasants, overthrow the forty bandits and villagers can grow rice in peace once again. The storyline resembles various westerns, for instance John Ford's Stagecoach (1939), but there is something more in Seven Samurai. The beauty of the simple plot has something that great novels by Dostoevsky have. This Japanese fresco is wider, more complex and manifold. To this simple story Kurosawa has added depth and beauty through brilliant details which usually are the things that make the films by him so great. In the midst of the grand fighting sequences Kurosawa has placed scenes which offer several humanely interesting and understanding characteristics of life and human nature. He offers lyric flashes of the beauty of nature and love; a flowing river, crying men, a woman throwing herself into a burning house because she has lost her glory, and the sparking love between one samurai and a farmer's girl. These kind of emotional scenes, Kurosawa often seals with rain. The cleansing, but also melancholy, rain.After the violent final sequence, where the samurais and the farmers have to kill the last 13 bandits, the film returns to its calm rhythm. Four of the samurais have died, and the last three look at the farmers planting rice. The samurais didn't win the war, they lost; they got their rice and were unemployed once again. Life won the war, and the fearful peace-loving farmers got the reward; not the warlike but helpful samurais.There is so much to say about this timeless masterpiece which is impossible to process in one thousand words. Seven Samurai is a beautiful film about humanity and the depth of it. It's a complex and life-enhancing fresco. A gorgeous tale of the human nature and solidarity. Just as John Ford, so did Kurosawa portray brave men but to him bravery wasn't all glory and fame; in Seven Samurai we see men crying, talking about emotions and what's on their minds. This was an unconventional theme for Japan and it proves how much more humane Seven Samurai is compared to western masterpieces. This should not be interpreted as an insult towards westerns or John Ford, not at all, he was one of Kurosawa's biggest influences -- and bravery was never a shallow or simple theme for Ford either. Kurosawa's social and political ideologies are not hard to see but overall the lyricism and beauty of the ending indicate that humanism is the greatest ideal of all for him. I feel that it is only fair to end this review the way it started, by quoting the master himself.""An action film can only be an action film. But how wonderful it is if it can also depict the human nature. It has been my dream ever since I was a co-director. For ten years I've wanted to deal with the ancient drama from this new perspective."" (Akira Kurosawa)"
"While I'd recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it, I really don't think it's worthy of a top 10 ranking. The storyline was solid, but, like most movies of it's era, the over-acting bordered on being comical. Which brings up a point...I have read several user comments about how older movies don't get a fair shake in the movie rankings. I completely disagree, I think a lot of the ""timeless classics"" are rated a lot higher than deserved. Fact of the matter is, modern movies ARE better than movies of bygone eras...the acting is better, the storylines are crisper, they're better directed, there's more attention to detail, etc. This is just one guy's opinion, but after watching this movie, ask yourself a question...If this movie were to come out today (with the same acting and directing), would it receive the same high acclaim it enjoys? No way."
"If you think a three-hour Japanese movie from the mid-50s about an ancient time in history sounds like one big snoozer, you'd be right. It SOUNDS like a snoozer. But just sit down to watch this film, and you'll realize how wrong you are. ""Seven Samurai"" is one of the most exciting, suspenseful films I've ever seen, and the running time passed so quickly that I wasn't even ready for the film to be over. I've watched T.V. sitcoms that felt longer.Akira Kurosawa displays utter mastery of every aspect of cinema. There's not a flaw in this film: it's flawlessly acted, paced, edited, composed, scored. It's an action film for thinking people, one that more than holds its own against any movie released today.Astoundingly good.Grade: A+"
"Undoubtedly, the director was way ahead of his time with The Seven Samurai. I can appreciate it, really i can. The problem for me is that for me it is just a little too dated. If I watched this back in 1954, it would have been a 10/10, but unfortunately some of us have higher standards these days.The picture is pretty grainy, and the soundtrack adds tedium to the lengthy build up that precedes the final battle. Some of the acting is a little over the top to be plausible, and it's hard to have any sympathy for the villagers who are just a bit too cowardly to be worth saving.I know it's one of the world's great movies, and the majority of viewers will love it, but I can't see myself watching it again in a hurry."
"Akira Kurosawa made ""Seven Samurai"" because he wanted to make a real ""jidai-geki,"" a real period-film that would present the past as meaningful, while also being an entertaining film. Kurosawa considered ""Rashomon,"" the film rightfully credited with making the West aware of the Japanese cinema, with being neither. But in his attempt to make a truly ""realistic"" film, Kurosawa redefined the conflict at the heart of Japanese films. Before ""Seven Samurai"" this conflict was that of love versus duty, where the central character is compelled by fate to sacrifice what he loves in the name of duty. In ""Seven Samurai"" the focus remains on duty, yet the conflict is now between the real and the pretended. Calling yourself a samurai does not make you one, something proved time and time again in the film, from the test of skill turned deadly between Kyuzo (Seiji Miyaguchi) and the tall samurai to the first appearance of Kikuchiyo (Toshirô Mifune), with his stolen pedigree. Like Katshushiro (Ko Kimura), the youngster who wants to learn from the master, Kambei (Takashi Shimura), the audience is educated as to the true nature of the samurai.For me this film deals with the heroic, albeit in realistic terms. I have shown the film in World Literature classes, after students have read Homer's ""Iliad"" and as they begin reading Cervantes' ""Don Quixote."" Within that context, compared to the brutal arrogance of Achilles and the gentle insanity of Quixote, the heroic qualities of the seven samurai become clear. Their inspiration extends to some of the villagers. Manzo (Kamatari Fujiwara) is crazed with fear over the virtue of his daughter, Shino (Keiko Tsushima), and Rikichi (Yoshio Tsuchiya) fights to avenge the disgrace of his wife and his precipitating the death of Heihachi (Minoru Chiaki), but it is the comic Yohei (Bokuzen Hidari), who finds within himself the ability to fight, a die a tragic death, who is the true barometer for what the samurai mean to the village. But the greatest tragedy is that despite this most noble effort and the bodies buried in honor at the top of the village cemetery, this has been but a temporary union between the villagers and the samurai. When Kambei declares, ""We have lost again,"" he redefines the battles: it was not to kill all the bandits, it was to find a true place in the world. Yet we should have already known this, for the painful truth was driven home when Kyuzo, the master swordsman, is gunned down from behind. No better proof is needed in this film of the bitter truth that the world is not fair.Mifune is the maniacal spirit of this film, as the faux-samurai Kikuchiyo, the dancing whirlwind whose emotions overwhelm everything including himself. But it is Shimura as Kambei, who embodies the mentor mentality with a minimum of effort, evoking more by rubbing his hand over his shaved head or giving a single piercing look than by any spoken dialogue. Even in a strong ensemble these performances stand out, for clearly different reasons. To fully appreciate Kurosawa's mastery in ""Seven Samurai"" you need to watch the film several times to better appreciate the way he constructs scenes, using contrasting images, evocative music and varying the length of cuts to affect tempo. For example, look carefully at how the early scene of the farmers searching the streets for samurai and the later sequence where Katsushiro watches Kyuzo and Kikuchiyo waiting for the bandit scouts to return to their horses. Both of these scenes are superb primers to Kurosawa's style.For years we had to put with the 160-minute version of the film that was made for export, which was actually called ""The Magnificent Seven"" until John Strugis's Western remake. Fortunately, ""Seven Samurai"" has been restored to full 208-minute glory, saved from being a lamentable cinematic tragedy on a par with ""Greed,"" ""The Magnificent Ambersons,"" and ""Ivan the Terrible."" There is a sense in which ""Seven Samurai"" is truly my favorite film, because it was the one that instilled in me a love of cinema, of the craft and art of movie making, of compelling me to understand intellectually how Kurosawa was skillfully manipulating my emotions. The final battle sequences, fought and filmed in a torrent of rain, exhausting characters and audience alike with its increasingly relentless tempo, is given its potency because of the human elements that have been established in all that has taken place before hand. ""Seven Samurai"" is a magnificent film against which the vast majority of epics pale in comparison. Not even Kurosawa scaled these heights ever again."
"Let me first say: the seven samurai is a very gripping movie. There is hardly a moment in the movie that is not absolutely worth your time, which is quite a feat for a movie that is over three hours long.But the movie is not perfect. Like in most older Japanese movies the characters are almost cartoon-like, and so is their behavior. So much even that you can watch the Japanese-language version, which you should, without subtitles and still understand everything that is going on. The genius of Kurosawa gets away with it. Almost any other director would not have been able to make a serious movie in such a cartoon-style. And then there is the goofs. People switch positions when viewpoints change back and forth. People get stabbed again and again and still walk away as if tickled by a feather. How does this fit a movie in which every shot is supposed to be handcrafted? None the less, this is a wonderful movie and a landmark in movie-history. But one should see all of the movie and not just it's magic. So in my opinion The Seven Samurai is a very intense, very worthwhile movie. But it's not flawless."
"What else can I say that hasn't already been said about this film? Nothing much but I'll still tell you my own experiences about watching this film.I had just recently become interested about Akira Kurosawa after being very impressed by some of his films: Dersu Uzala and Ran. Now when I had the chance to watch this man's most recognized work that has said to be the first modern action film, I could not let it pass by. This film was 51 years old when I watched it. Being born to this generation which grew up with fast-paced, explosive action films filled with computer effects, I shouldn't have been entertained when watching this colossal 3½ hour, slow-paced, black&white film with no computer effects at all. Despite all that this film shines bright for it is film-making at its best. If there is one film in this world that is completely flawless then it must be this one. All aspects in this film work perfectly: acting, directing, art direction, costume design, cinematography, editing, sound, everything!The Best thing about Kurosawa is the way he uses the camera to tell the story: visually stunning yet simple. Honest film-making with no tricks.If you haven't seen this film and have intentions on seeing it, then you are an idiot. Sorry but this film is larger than life and you just can't die without seeing it or you shall always feel that you have missed something grand.(Note: this last paragraph is only directed to fellow film-fanatics)"
Let's see what this movie didn't have going for it to this middle-aged American. 1. It's in black-and-white 2. It's in Japanese 3. It takes place in a 16th century Japanese farming village 4. It's subtitled...and 5. It's 207 minutes long And it's just about the best movie I've ever seen...the time flew by.  I didn't want it to end.  Kurisawa has made a masterpiece I can't recommend highly enough.
One of the master piece of all time Seven Sumarai will take you on wild ride. For all the Indians who have watched Sholay this is the movie it is inspired of. The daram is unmatched and fight sequences are to die for. The well crafted film will give you an experience to hold on to.

"I have several laserdiscs at home (I only recently purchased a DVD player)and many are films that I see occasionally when I first buy them, then never see them again for a long time. The CAV version of Seven Samurai is a film that draws me back time and time again. It's a damn shame too many people refuse to see it because it isn't in English! I taped a copy for my cousin in New Jersey, and although I gave it my highest recommendation, he still has not seen it to this day.It's easier to focus on the few flaws of this film than to try to pinpoint what makes this film great. Katsushiro still seems incredibly wimpy for a samurai, and if you see this film in an art-house theatre the subtitles may not be as good as the ones on the Criterion version. It disturbed me that Rickichi's wife would rather commit suicide than come home to her husband--it wasn't HER fault the bandits kidnapped and raped her.But that's about it for naysaying. Not only are the action scenes terrific, but Kurosawa does a great job establishing the character of the samurai and peasants. You don't see a villain with a dynamic personality (as in ""The Magnificent Seven"") but Kurosawa is more interested in the relationship between the samurai and the peasants. One of the things the viewer learns is that many peasants think of samurai (in general) as merely bandits with higher breeding. The villagers are not saintly victims in this film, and the samurai are not superhuman swordsmen. Because the viewer gets to KNOW the characters in this film, their deaths have a greater impact than they do in the American version.If you haven't seen this film before, I both pity and envy you. I pity that you haven't been fortunate enough to see this film before, but I envy the fact that you will soon see it for the first time."
"''Shichinin no samurai '' more well known as ''The Seven samurai''is another of Kurosawa's masterpieces, and the most popular movie from the director of all times. It's not a coincidence that this movie has such a high ranking in IMDb's votes, being the 7th movie in the Rank. From the actors who play the samurai of this movie, we see notably Toshirô Mifune again,one of the most famous actors from Japan that is many of Kurosawa's classics. Full of innovations for the time the movie was made, like the slow motion for dramatic flair, the reluctant hero and some determined scenes, this movie is considered to be the first action movie already produced.A small village is constantly being attacked by some dangerous bandits, who are always devastating the homes of the locals. Seeing that they cannot live in this way, the villagers decide to hire samurais to protect and fight for them. All the samurais hired have meals as payments,since they were not in their best and the villagers cannot offer much. We see during the movie the samurais teaching the villagers how to defend themselves and also awesome battles, the best being the last one, when a huge amount of bandits come to destroy the village."
"A village is constantly attacked by well armed bandits. One day after an attack they seek the wisdom of an elder who tells them they cannot afford weapons, but they can find men with weapons, samurai, who will fight for them, if they find samurai who are in down on their luck and wondering where their next meal will come from. They find a very experienced samurai with a good heart who agrees to recruit their party for them. He selects five genuine samurai and one who is suspect but the seven return to the village to protect it from the forty plus bandits.If you could only watch one film in your lifetime, this one is it. Yes that's a pretty bold statement, but it's true. Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai is a must see for any film fan. Kurosawa brought so many elements together for this film that it is on such a grand an epic scale.Each samurai has their own arc to them, from being the experienced warrior to a young hopeful. Kurosawa takes his time to develop each character on his/her own terms and it works wonderfully. The film is extremely long and the epic battler doesn't take place till the final part of the film, but here we get to know our Seven Samurai, all of them, very well. We care for each, not wanting them to die in the heat of the battle, for a film to be able to do this for one character is great, but for seven....is extraordinary.Samurai is a dazzlingly technical achievement for it's time and to this day outshines most ""epic"" movies we see today. It has beautiful cinematography and art direction. Kurosawa has a keen eye and uses it well in this film.Samurai has one of if not the most amazing battle put to screen. The samurai turn the village into a fortress and use the surroundings to their help. The battle is so massive it spawns roughly 30 some odd minutes. The climatic battle itself goes through every rock that mother nature throws it's way, from the cold dirty rain to the hot dry day. It has influenced all the films we see today, The Return of The King, The Magnificent Seven, Narnia. Please don't see this film expecting BRAVEHEART, because there will be no limbs flying off the screen. But the action is beautifully filmed and shows early use of slow-motion.Samurai packs an emotional punch at the end, as it shows how the samurai are honorable, we have been on this journey with them since their beginning to their end and we cannot help but feel sorrow for the ones lost in the battle. We feel sorrow for the Samurai because in the end they get nothing, yes the village is safe and the enemy is gone, but the only thing the samurai get is a loss in numbers.Samurai is a landmark film that has it's place in history as one of the greatest. For those that can't comprehend it, think of it as Japan's Citizen Kane....only better. For a film that has inspired so many and given us so much, there is only praise to be said. For if it were not for this film, we may not be where we are today in cinema."
"I admit I am one of the younger generation that needs an I.V. of caffeine to avoid falling asleep when watching a black and white ""classic"" like Citizen Kane or Gone With the Wind.I find the acting and general direction of those films boring and uninteresting.Seven Samurai was a different story.It has nothing to do with it being about samurai, this movie doesn't even have much violence till the very end of its 3½+ hours. Even the subtitles, which I am sure lost much in the translation, didn't bother me at all.This movie lacks absolutely nothing. To sum up everything I love about it would take many paragraphs.Next time someone tells you Pulp Fiction or Star Wars is the ""Best Movie Ever"", sit them down in front of Seven Samurai.I only wish I was fluent in Japanese so I could experience this the way it was intended."
"I really like this movie and have seen it several times, but each time I have to question why the bandits would attack a defended village. They had pillaged it before an unknown number of times and each time would have just ridden in and taken what they wanted. This time was radically different. Gone were the straightforward accesses and in place were flooded areas, stout fences, and Samauri. I would have to say the bandit leader was lacking in marbles. Why not just ride on to the next village and plunder that one? Why engage a formidable enemy and risk losing any men at all? At any rate had I been a rider I would have ridden the other way once the fighting began and not stick with an idiot who called himself the leader."
"Its sad really, sad the way teens with their pop crap go off watching something like 2 Fast 2 Furious and stick their two thumbs up because its ""in"" and then they see this movie and just because it has no color and no English it ""bad"". I actually think that it being black and white and devoid from the English language makes it just that bit better.But enough about stupid teenagers heres my review.This was the first Akira Kurosawa film I had seen and the fact that it went for 3 and a half hours kind of put me off. But nevertheless I was convinced to see it and when I did I tried my hardest not to blink because I would miss one nanosecond of a great film. The music was superb, story was even more superb and has been remade many times (Magnificent Seven, A Bugs Life etc.) and the action sequences didn't rely on flashy cgi crap to make me totally into it. Toshiro Mifune is positively wonderful and god I could go on.But alas no great film is great without cons. Please wait a few hours while I see if there are any. The fight sequence with the bamboo sticks in the town took too long both with the swords and bamboo. The sub story with Katsuhiro and Manzos daughter was unnecessary. But other than that the film was perfect! So if you're into crap like House of Wax because it has Paris Hilton in it destroy the DVD or video of it and watch Shichinin no Samurai over and over until you get that stupid I'll watch bad movies because its ""in"" idiocy out of your head and watch something cultured.(Apologies to those who are pro teen and like 2 Fast 2 Furious or House of Wax)"
"I'm going to start this off by saying I'm not a professional, so my understanding of camera work and cinematography is at layman's levels. However, I think this movie is somewhat overrated. The visuals are impressive and the movie has a more modern feel to it then other movies from the same time. I definitely think it's worthwhile seeing.But I don't agree that the characters are fleshed out. Perhaps a student of Asian history would find this movie fascinating, but if all sorts of important exchanges are happening under the surface, I missed most of them. I suppose it is too much to expect the director to spell out aspects of Japanese life and educate us, but without that, I found the characters stiff caricatures of little interest to me. Much the same as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (although the two movies are VERY different).The movie is simply far too long. While those visuals I mentioned are amazing, I think the editing is horrible. I enjoyed it up to the two hour mark but I knew I was running on empty after that. It suffers the from the same bloating that occurred in older American movies like Gone with the Wind. I know what you're thinking: He has no attention span and is amused by music videos from the MTV era. Well, I do tend to like shorter poems. Why? Brevity is a rare and powerful force. Things should be as long as they need to be. I have enjoyed longer features, and I'm a great fan of movies with slow, beautiful scenes. But this movie collapsed under its own weight.I know many people will disagree, and I might appear foolish to say this, but I don't think foreign films are necessarily better then Hollywood films. The pendulum seems to swing both ways when it comes to this matter, people defending foreign movies as vastly superior to ""mainstream"" movies, or running them down simply because they have to read subtitles and move outside their comfort zone. I don't think foreign status is enough to elevate this movie beyond the ranks of many other good adventure/action movies. With some prudent editing, script revision and greater depth in portrayal, it might even have been great."
"I gave this film a 2/10.  It was saved from 1/10 status sheerly by the fact that it *was* an inspiration to so many movies than came after it (and redefined the American Western).  The best way to think of this movie, though, is as the Japanese Citizen Kane: classic, original, and vastly overrated.  I am sorry to say this about the work of such a great director. I thought Rashômon was amazing.  But this . . . well . . . not.First and foremost, the film cannot justify its almost comically absurd length.  I don't shy away from long movies as long as there are sufficient plot and character development to keep me interested.  The plot here is so straightforward it's kind of embarassing.  The characters themselves are little more than paper cutouts with little no emotional lives whatsoever.  I challenge ANYBODY reading this to find me one person who was actually moved by the Shino love subplot, or the subplot where Mifune's character is exposed as the son of a farmer.  Nobody cares, but why should we?  None of this has any impact on the story anyhow.  In fact, the ""personal"" sequences of the film serve as little else besides filler between action sequences.I couldn't even get behind the few characters that actually were given breathing space in the film: the villagers.  They were all whiny, crotchety, needy, and generally a pain in the arse for 3 hours.  While this is indeed a theme of the film, it's frustrating because I need SOMEONE to sympathize with here, if for no other reason that to relieve the mind numbing boredom this film induces.Technically, this film is great, but it has no soul.  Thus, all the technique goes to waste.  I'm happy this was made because there are so many works derivative of it that I love (especially King's Dark Tower novels). But I have *no* desire to ever see this again, and I would advise anyone else considering it to stay away."
"The scene where two bandits are fleeing and are shot by their own, they are hit a split second before the gunshot sound is heard - this is not a mistake. Do you really think Kurosawa would miss that?  That scene is done on purpose.  So if you see a version where the hit and gunshot are at the same time, its altered. Kurosawa was to much of a perfectionist, please change your claim inthe""goofs"" section it's an insult!"
