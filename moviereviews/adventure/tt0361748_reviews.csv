"This review gives everything away, so see the movie first.It is neither allegory nor satire, the two finest categories in both fiction and cinema, and yet it approaches perfection anyway. It is of a nature I have no name for, but it is a nature that reveals truth and undermines falsehoods. Nothing is more cloaked in falsehood than the victor's depiction of past wars. It is especially true of the children of the victors--especially the children of US WWII veterans, like myself.We get our view of the war from movies like Audi Murphy in To Hell and Back or Saving Private Ryan. Nothing but praise for our heroes and cheers for killing the enemy. But QT exposes this hypocrisy by engineering a film where we are disgusted first by the excesses of the enemy and then by the excesses of our heroes. That is the first instance. The hypocrisy is slammed home in the second instance where we are first disgusted by the sight of American after American being shot dead by by a German sniper hero and secondly brought to revel in the butchery of several hundred enemy at the hands of our heroes. Tit for tat.It fits the pattern of praise for our heroes and cheers for killing the enemy, but because it is presented both ways the hypocrisy becomes self- evident. This is why so many people hate the movie--even if they fail to realize it. High art, true art, 10 of 10."
"That's what I thought, when I heard about the cast of Inglorious Basterds. And I'm both from Germany and into movies.That guy is older than 50 and so far he almost only played in mediocre TV series - and even there he didn't play the main parts. Obviously nobody ever noticed, what he's capable of. Now, thanks to QT, he got one shot to change that - and - let's put it this way - that was a bingo! He is the living proof of what a great caster Tarrantino is.By the way: I think it's a great privilege to watch the movie as a German - being able to understand everything. And the German dialog is written almost as good as the English.Now I could repeat, what many others have written here before. I'll put it short: Finally, QT is back."
"After watching Inglorious Basterds i was really surprised when i saw ratings on IMDb. Didn't expected high ratings and top 250 place. If we can only isolate and rate Christoph Waltz's acting performance i would agree that this movie deserves 10. But he is not alone, and his performance can't cover horrible plot, boring conversations, unfunny characters, alternative QT WW2 fantasy and Eli Roth as Jew bear. The opening scene with Denis Menochet as farmer and Christoph Waltz as SS officer is best part of the movie. Only part that have same quality and connects tension from that scene with the rest of the movie is a basement scene. Basement scene was crossroad for me. Michael Fassbender was great in role of British spy and his character adds some new layer of logic and realism in movie. In moments you can actually see some plot finally breaking through the rubbish you watched after the farm scene. After the basement chapter, movie is going nowhere. Empty space. A lot of empty space for movie that last 153 minutes. Long and boring scenes with boring characters and conversations. Childish fantasy mixed up with Spaghetti western movies and some atmosphere that don't belong to WW2 period. Thats why we have basterds to fill everything else and patch the rest of movie. They failed. Basterds are weakest/undeveloped and most boring part of movie. Movie is named by them, yes - Brad is on Movie poster ... but they are horrible. Worst role of Mr Pitt and i hope last one from Eli Roth. Cinema/Shosanna story with David Bowie music was just another QT patch v1.1 to fill huge empty space between farm and basement. Extremely boring scenes with Mélanie Laurent (taking off cinema letters, red dresses, secret love Marcel...) will blast your brain. Yes - headache is a must. Beside 2 good scenes, i really enjoyed listening smooth gradient of German, French and English language. But again, this is connected to Waltz and Fassbender and their personal knowledge that Tarantino used for his fantasy. Inglorious Basterds is Hybrid movie where gangsters are replaced with Nazis adding them wild west background layer with Brad Pitt on movie poster just to sell tickets. It doesn't work in this case.5/10 - only for Christoph Waltz and Michael Fassbender."
"I will just start with some quotes from other reviewers that describes it the best.""This is easily one of the most overrated films of the year and probably the worst film Tarantino has ever done."" ""The ONLY good thing in this movie was the performance of Mr. Waltz"".""So I was really disappointed, and seeing this movie on place #40 of the greatest movies of all time is the only thing about this, that leaves me with my mouth opened"" Now for more details go and read ""Hated it"" reviews.One thing I hate about a movie is when it treats audience as bunch of dumb people. (Spoiler ahead). Now I know Tarantino's style is based on fantasy and fictitious plots, but come on, Adolf Hitler and 200 top Nazis Officers will be in attendance of a movie premier in occupied France and you have only two guards in the whole theater and the surroundings? Where also an American-African walks around freely with steel pipes locking doors and setting fire. These 2 guards are then executed in seconds opening the door for our 2 ""heroes"" to slay Hitler at point blank with around 100 rounds... very dumb. At least, challenge our intelligence and create a smarter plot to kill one of the most feared tyrants of all time (Go watch Valkyrie). Besides, Mike Myers impersonation of a British general is more realistic and authentic than the guy doing Hitler, just picture that.What ruined it further, is that the only smart and powerful character, which nailed everyone in the movie, with his psychological and mind bending interrogations, ends up to be effortlessly tricked by the most mindless character in the movie.After watching the movie, I was sympathizing with Nazis, who were portrayed to have more bravery and humanity than our Basterds!!! Imagine that.My recommendations, if you have insomnia, 2hrs 33 min to waste or you want to give your mind a break, go watch this movie."
"I had the PRIVILEGE of attending the UK premier of Inglorious Basterds this evening! Having seen the trailers i had high hopes but had doubts due to a string of self indulgent films (c'mon lets be honest, self indulgence is his tarantinos middle name)I was surprised to find though that he had pulled the cat out of the bag with this one. The film is rich with interesting dialogue, Perfect timed comedy with a dash of brutal assassination.The crowning glory of this film though lies with Christoph Waltz whom no fault or error can be found. He manages to create a real tension in the audience whilst remaining quite ""theatrical"" (couldn't think of a better word). He definitely deserved his prize at Cannes and is heading for an Oscar no doubt!!!! Hoping to see him in something again soon!"
"Inglorious Basterds is a dark and violent comic fantasy, gloriously so. Built on the framework of The Dirty Dozen, Inglorious Basterds ditches the elongated training sequences of The Dirty Dozen to plunge into the action right away. In the process, Tarantino fixes one of The Dirty Dozen's major flaws by giving the bad guys screen time to remind us just how bad the Nazis were. The Nazis with the most screen time end up becoming the most completely human characters in the film, which ironically makes them even worse monsters.Bu ditching the training sequences, Tarantino is also able to give us a picture of the entire war, showing us not only British, American and German soldiers, but also giving us glimpses into the world of French and German civilians, both collaborators and Resistance.It goes without saying that any Tarantino film is going to have fantastic dialogue, but when Tarantino made the decision to have the French characters speak French and the Germans speak German, beyond adding a level of authenticity, Tarantino also somehow ensured that his dialogue in French was as sharp and funny and clever as his English dialogue.Case in point, during the opening sequence the Nazi ""Jew Hunter"" SS Colonel Hans Landa (Christian Waltz) is interrogating French dairy farmer Perrier LaPadite (Denis Menochet). Landa suspects that LaPadite is hiding a family of Jews. While subtly pressuring LaPadite, Landa asks for a glass of milk. After greedily gulping it down, Landa compliments LaPadite on his daughters and his cows, ""à votre famille et à vos vaches, je dis bravo."" The thing of it is, in French ""vache"" means cow, but it is also a vulgar name for the vagina. If reprimanded for this vulgar pun, Landa could quite convincingly claim not to understand French well enough to have meant it that way, but Landa does mean it that way and he means it as a threat. And LaPadite understands his meaning all too well.That is a really subtle piece of acting and word-play that many audiences would never catch, or at least they might understand the subtext without knowing the exact nature of the threat. The film is rich with that kind of detail. All of the French and English dialogue is chosen with that same attention to detail and while I can't swear to the German, I would suspect that it shows a similar level of craft.Inglorious Basterds opens with the phrase, ""Once Upon a Time... in Nazi-Occupied France."" Personally, this reminds me of the opening of every Asterix book and movie, another comic fantasy in a war-torn occupied France. Like Asterix, Inglorious Basterds is howlingly funny in places, although the film also turns darkly serious.In its more serious moments, Inglorious Basterds reminds us that the first casualties of war are compassion and the ability to relax, as in almost every elongated sequence of the film, Tarantino finds a new way to build cruel tension to almost unbearable levels.Tarantino also reminds us that film is dangerous, even inflammable and that its power deserves respect.If you can see this film as I did in a packed theatre filled with knowledgeable fans who get every joke, that you will see this masterful film the way that it was meant to be seen. If you are not that lucky, all that you will see is a great, great film that delivers a darkly funny punch."
"Brad Pitt sticks his index finger in Diane Kruger's leg wound and keeps it there until he gets what he wants. Funny, horribly so. The invented yarn takes ""The Dirty Dozen"" for a ride and sometimes abandons it to pay tribute to other movies. Lots of fun. Even ""Paris when it sizzles"" is mentioned in a delightfully organic piece of dialog. I was thrilled by Christoph Waltzer's character and by his sensational performance. Brad Pitt creates a true original. I love the actor's lack of vanity. There's a quirk in the character that is pure Brad Pitt. Tarantino visits a new universe but. fortunately, his hand. his brain and his heart are visible all over the place."
"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.What is the purpose of this movie? A bunch of Americans enters Nazi-occupied France and starts slaughtering Germans. You see them scalping their enemies and beating them to death with baseball bats. While making jokes, of course.Some will say that this movie is a parody of a certain genre. For a parody, it is neither witty nor funny. The contents is zero. It is exceptionally brutal and disgusting. Underneath lies a subtle political message, because it is again ""the good guys"" killing ""bad Nazis"". The whole plot is unthinkable if you turn it around. Could you imagine a storyline where Nazis (while making jokes) kill everybody in the Warsaw ghetto with flamethrowers? Probably not, but this movie is exactly about that, with the exception that is satisfies the weird moral expectations of a certain audience: slaughtering people is so cool when done by the right people.This movie only works because of the hidden Nazi-ideology underneath. It does not regard the enemy as people. And if the latter is supposed to be an element of the fun, I am happy to say that this kind of fun will always remain a mystery to me.Another mystery is how such violence can fascinate the American crowd while a bit of nudity will freak them out. But if a naked body is pornography, this movie with all its brutality is pure pornography at its very worst.Inglorious Basterds is a pointless, boring and tasteless waste of time and money."
"Chapter One: Once Upon a Time At A Table (1941)In which a German Nazi and a French Dairy Farmer talk at a table for 20 minutes; first in French, then in English.Chapter Two: Three Years Of Inglorious Basterds In Sixteen Minutes... Without Tables (Mostly)In which an American Lieutenant talks to his newly formed 8 man Jewish- American commando unit. There are no tables present. Cut to Adolf Hitler, three years later. He is angry at his men's inability to deal with the Basterds. Hitler does have a table. We return to the Basterds in a flashback. Again, distinct lack of table-based content. Chapter Three: German Night in Paris... At A Table... TalkingIn which a Jewish woman who escaped from under the table in Chapter One has somehow managed to become the proprietress of a cinema. The Jewish woman talks to an Actor at a table in a bar. Later, the Jewish woman, the Actor, Joseph Goebbels and a Translator talk at a table in a Restaurant. The Actor and Goebbels talk in German. The Translator translates the German into French. The Jewish woman replies in French. The Translator translates the French into German. Goebbels decides to hold a film premiere at the Jewish woman's cinema. The Actor and Goebbels leave. The Nazi (who talked with the Dairy Farmer at a table for twenty minutes back in Chapter One) arrives. He talks with the Jewish woman at the table. He leaves. The Jewish woman breaks down; overcome with emotion at having spent so long talking at a table. Chapter Four: Operation Table TalkingIn which Austin Powers sends a British Officer to join the Basterds and an Actress on a mission to talk in German at a table in a Tavern. After 21 minutes of talking at a table they all shoot each other. The actress survives but spends the next 5 minutes lying on a table talking.Chapter Five: Revenge of the Giant TableIn which, The Basterds decide to continue the operation by talking in Italian and suicide bombing the cinema. The Nazi takes the Actress into a small room where they sit next to a table. A hoe that he found under the table in the Tavern fits her so he kills her. Then he takes two of the Basterds to a big room, where they sit and talk at a table. Meanwhile, the cinema burns down, Hitler is riddled with bullets and the two Basterds blow themselves up for no good reason at all.The End"
"It just goes to show how wrong you can be. I had not expected to like this film. I was disappointed by both the Kill Bill films (although i preferred the second) and Death Proof (although it was better in the shorter cut of the double-bill release). I love Reservoir Dogs, admire Pulp Fiction and think that Jackie Brown is Tarantino's most mature piece of film-making - technically his most superior - including the last great performance elicited from Robert De Niro. Since then it seems to me while his films have been okay (i haven't hated them) he has been treading water in referential, reverential, self-indulgent juvenilia.Then i read the script last year for Inglourious Basterds - and i hated it! Sure it had some typical QT flourishes and the opening scene was undeniably powerful. There were a couple of great characters. But on page it was more juvenile rubbish, largely ruined by the largess of the uninteresting Basterds of the title. It made me seriously contemplate not seeing the film. The trailers did nothing to convince me. I only changed by mind when i had the opportunity to see the film with a Tarantino Q&A following in London. I figured it would be worth enduring to hear him in Q&A as i know from interviews how entertaining he can be in person.So little was i prepared for the sheer exuberant fun and brilliance of Inglourious Basterds.Easily Mr Tarantino's best work since Jackie Brown it is a triumph.Yes the references are there but they do not interfere with the story, they are not the driving force. Yes Eli Roth is stunt casting but he works fine, with little to do but look aggressive, and does nothing to hurt the film as i had feared. While i admired Mr Tarantino for using stuntwoman Zoe Bell as herself in Death Proof in order to amp-up the exhilaration of the major stunt scene her lack of any acting ability in a key role was a problem for the film. The same could be said of Tarantino's own appearances in several films, especially Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk Till Dawn, which Tarantino wrote.What really makes this work is how BIG it is. The spaghetti western vibe to much of the style, dialogue and performances is wonderfully over the top without descending too far into the cartoon quality of Kill Bill. The violence is so big. The audacity so big. Brad Pitt is so big! In the trailers the Hitler moment and Pitt's performance bothered me but in the context of the film they are hilarious. Pitt is actually brilliant here, exactly what he needs to be. He is Mifune's blustering samurai in Yojimbo, he is Robards Cheyenne from Once Upon a Time in the West, there is a very James Coburn vibe to him, and of course a suitably Lee Marvin edge.Christoph Waltz (who i did not previously known) and Melanie Laurent (who i first noticed in a brilliant French-language British short film by Sean Ellis) are sensational and i expect to see both used a lot more in the future. Tarantino has clearly not lost his eye for casting, which seemed to desert him in Death Proof. Waltz is equally large in his performance. Chilling, yet theatrical. He is Fonda from OUATITW, Van Cleef from Good, The Bad & the Ugly. And Laurent is suitably Cardinale innocence but tough, a fighter. They both dazzle here.That every member of the cast gets the fun to be had from what they are doing while not indulging themselves in just having fun and trying to get laughs helps tremendously. The laughs - and there are loads - come organically. Only Mike Myers comes close to tipping the wink and pushing it too far but his scene is reigned in just enough - with the help of a fantastic Michael Fassbender who seems pulled directly from the mold of Attenborough's Great Escape leader.All the actors shine and Tarantino throws in wonderful flourishes, but ones that work with the story. The introduction of Schweiger's Hugo Stiglitz is a riot. After a sensational slow-burn opening and a glorious intro to those inglourious Basterds the pace never lets up and over two and half hours flies by.It also looks beautiful, marking this as a return to real film-making rather than just self-indulgent silliness. The musical choices, as always, are inspired from Morricone on.The film is audacious and hilarious. After a summer when nearly every film has disappointed me it came as a huge surprise that the real fun and entertaining, but also involving and impressive film should be this one, when i would never have believed it from script form. Welcome back QT."
"Once again, revenge is at the center of a Quentin Tarantino movie. This time a Jewish dirty dozen takes things on their own hands. Tarantino re-writes history and shortens WWII with a comic stroke that is as entertaining as it is vacuous. A fantasy that re-arranges some controversial historical points. Okay, it's a movie and as such it works for most of its two and a half hours. Christoph Waltz opens things up in the most promising way. The opening sequence is filled with a subtle but unbearable tension. Weltz amalgamates all the Nazi villains we have loved and hated in the movies into one glorious creation. (I will advise my countrymen to see it in its original multi-language version - the Italian version is another movie altogether. Some of the extra pleasures are in the dialog that, naturally, are not to be found in the Italian version) Brad Pitt, rapidly becoming one of the best character actors in the world, with a leading man's face and billing, is truly fantastic. Diane Kruger makes a credible Barbara Bouchet (one of Tarantino's muses from trash action Italian movies from the 70's) and the rest of the cast has some exquisite touches like Rod Taylor as Winston Churchill. Highly recommended for a Sunday afternoon."
"An fun, engrossing, beautifully crafted piece of nonsense, the likes of which we hadn't seen in a long long time. The silliness of the story is marvelously camouflaged with great dialogue and some superb performances. Christoph Waltz must be thinking already about his acceptance speech. What a performance! The civilized monster, polyglot, refined and deadly. He gets us going from the first, sensational scene. Brad Pitt is also wonderful. Was he putting a Mussolinni chin while impersonating (hilariously) an Italian? I thought so. His character's name sounds like Aldo Ray and I'm sure that's no accident. The film is full of movie references. Another character is named Fenek, as an homage to his 1970's sexpot, Edwige Fenech. What is already one of Tarantino's trademarks is his sure step along the most immediately recognizable bits of pop culture. He's clearly not a cultured man but a pop expert, king in a world where people get their news from TV, don't read, other than magazines and comics, etc. That's how it happens, to be in the right place at the right time. For better or worse this are Tarantino times."
"Everything is forgiven because ""Inglorious Basterds"" is so entertaining and at the end of the day that'ìs what matters. I think it's a pity that certain critics, specially in Italy, are determined to transform this clever pulp director into some kind of god. Maybe, partly, because Tarantino has been very clever, elevating some of the Italian pulp movies of the 60's and 70's to a sort of cult status. Italy is very grateful for that, he's rewarded with interminable praise. I fear that's the wrong approach, it's also confusing. He makes popcorn movies, brilliantly. The characters have never anything important to say, Burger King, Superman, that's the extent of its depth and I think he's tapping into a society that's getting shallower and shallower with every passing year. But, if I'm mentioning this instead of talking about all the great things I could be saying about his movie is because there is a strange force trying to brain wash me into believing that Tarantino is the most important influence in movies since time immemorial. No, he's a great director of inconsequential fun movies. I consider myself a fan and I intend to see all his future movies. This one has some wonderful touches, winking at other movies by John Sturges, Robert Aldrich etc. Brad Pitt and in particular Christoph Waltz give wonderful performances. Waltz is at the center of my favorite scenes in the film. Enjoy this movies for what it is and not for what critics are saying it is. You'll enjoy it even more that way."
"...""Inglorious"" as our local theater decided to display its title on their marquee, minus the second word. It is terrific cinema.I don't hesitate to recommend this film to all but the over-squeamish. Let them never know what they're missing.I did hesitate to give it ten stars because of my experience of Tarantino's previous films. In every case, save ""Reservoir Dogs,"" they have improved with additional watching.So although I gave it ten stars, I did so reluctantly. It leaves me no ""up"" to go to.Yes Christoph Waltz is the Nazi we've all imagined the worst to be. He is cultured, sophisticated, suave and most sadistic, the kind of man who can make a glass of milk a threat and who puts out his cigarette abruptly in a strudel, grinding it into the whipped cream as if he were grinding his heel into a victim.To understand Tarantino's films, you need only have a sense of dialogue, color and pacing. The colors are as bright as necessary and when necessary, brighter yet. In the French farmhouse of the opening scene, they are muted and dark, but excessively so. Outside a brilliant sun is shining, but in the one room of the house, everything is bathed in shadows and black.It is a brilliant setting for an interrogation by Waltz, as the ""Jew Hunter"" of the SS, who dangles his host French farmer over the precipice of revealing what he cannot reveal numerous times, then pulls him back with obsequious lines of friendship and understanding.A second sadistic German, well-played by August Diehl, later functions as important actor in the final plot twist. Diehl's Nazi Major, who has an ear for German accents, is almost as good as Waltz....almost.Film classes will study much from this movie. They should look lovingly at the superb pacing. Tarantino knows just how long to draw out a scene, building suspense in the manner of Hitchcock, then at just the breaking point, suddenly coming to a resolution.For color, look for a final shot at a French Theater, where its secretly Jewish proprietor is staging a surprise for the upper reaches of Nazi leadership.We see her, played by Melanie Laurent, awaiting the hated German dignataries who will arrive for a film preview of the latest Deutsch film masterpiece, a propaganda piece about a German hero and his dubious accomplishments.Laurent is framed on a balcony, reflected in the glass mirrors of the gorgeous theater, her red lips and low cut dress reflecting everywhere the intensity of her designs on her guests. It is a single shot that would be worth an entire film.There are thankfully many more such images, many more paced scenes of exquisite dialog and suspense.In short, see it. I'm sure you'll see it again and again."
"Seriously disappointing performance by Brad Pitt and Q T, the plot is very superficial and lame, and, unless indirectly intended, this film actually glorify the Nazis and portrays them as men of honor, and show that the Jewish people are deceiving, cant keep promises and bloody vicious. ((THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS SPOILER)) Hitler together with the most notorious Nazis are attending a stupid plot less movie about the killing of 300 Italian soldiers in a small cinema theater in Paris is unbelievably ridiculous. the Nazis laughing and hooraying each killing in the movie as if watching a basketball game STUPID, the deal at the end is lame. whats really appalling is that the movie earned great reviews and is ranked here in the 40s amongst the greatest 250 films. will not be surprised if it harvested many awards, including Oscars, as well. the movie is simply a kissing ass to the Jewish people, but hey reconsider, its not even doing a great job doing that. it truly dwarfed the whole Nazi - Jews conflict and a pure insult to all who fought and suffered from the tyranny of the Nazis."
"This usually all sounds a lot better in my head (so forgive me for rambling) I'm hardly Tarantino's biggest fan (and will *try* not to stoop to calling him a 'hack'....which is quite hard) I don't like to mock or critique a movie before seeing it. So with cautious hesitation, i walked to the cinema today to watch 'Inglorious Basterds'Now, to call it a 'rip-off of a rip-off' would be unfair here. Tarantino is happy enough to take the title from Enzo Castellari's (less than spectacular) Dirty Dozen clone, but not it's plot points (that, he takes from all other genre of movies) 'Inglorious' opens with a Nazi officer and his lengthy interrogation against a farmer who is hiding Jews in his basement. This is such an anti-climax, in that, it's dialogue is stale, and outcome signposted a mile off. Of course, one of the hidden Jews makes her escape (but more of her later) We (the obviously, easily pleased) audience are treated to the introduction of Lt. Aldo Raine (ha-ha, that name almost sounds like B-movie king ALDO RAY....ha-ha Quentin...keep those 'tributes' coming) and this character is played by none other than Brad (DALLAS) Pitt (sorry, DALLAS was about the only good thing he's ever starred in) and with jaw-jutting, Mr Jolie treats us to a hound-dogged, southern drawled, smirking Nazi-killer. Meanwhile Mr Tarantino forgets that actual grown-ups may be in attendance, so assumes that the teenyboppers won't have heard of the 'Dirty Dozen'?Raines 'platoon' consists of (John Cassavettes looking) blood-thirsty Jewish soldiers, all looking to get the big payback on Adolf Hitler. Tarantino in all his superior knowledge, pays special attention to two of these men, by casting his long time best buddy (and fellow homage-sycophant) Eli Roth (as the baseball bat wielding 'Bear Jew') The other man is called Hugo Stiglitz (and i'll wager more than half the QT fan-boys had never heard this name before this movie) Keep up the good work Tarantino, you've managed about 6 or 7 'hommages' so far (in the first 15 minutes) keep adding them, and it may detract from the plot (or lack of?)Anyhow, cutting a long (and extremely boring and protracted) story short, both Raine and his men (the 'Inglorious Basterds') and the sole survivor from chapter one, both have separate plots to kill Hitler at the showing of a Nazi-propaganda movie, in a french cinema (owned by the fore-mentioned survivor, now grown up)More boring (and pointless) conversations follow two and fro, as Pitt mugs away at an audience past caring. And any genuine suspense, leading to the assassination of the most deadly tyrant of all time, is thrown-away by the directors insistence of placing a 1980's David Bowie song in a WWII movie.My problems (and there are many) with this movie, is the re-occurring problem i have with most Tarantino product.....he rarely knows when to either start or stop. I don't need 'homage' after 'homage' to get the *joke* (whatever it may be) I knew of Inglorious Bastards, Enzo Castellari, Aldo Ray, Hugo Stiglitz (and the ultimate crime of the entire movie) Ennio Morricone's haunting score from REVOLVER. I go to the cinema to see the stars.....if the best you can do is the dire Barad Pitt, i'll assume You (Mr Tarantino) are the main draw here? I don't want the audience directing the movie. I pay to see YOUR vision, your ideas, your creativity....NOT how you can patchwork (time and time again) endless scenes from endless movies. It's high time the fan-boys (on IMDb) employed some 'tough love' on your 'idol' (god knows, if you don't....the studios should?)The tired old argument with Tarantino worshippers is ""well, if you can do better...do so"" Let me tell you, if i was a 46 year old director, with the (unfortunate) pull QT has.....i'd want to offer YOU a lot more than a warmed up muddled re-hash of better WWII movies than this tripe. The directors he attempts to emulate, made movies so bad by accident, or due to budgetary constraints. It's a cop out, time and time again, to hear his fans campaign his lack of imagination as 'art'. I'm sure he's capable of better (but after giving him the benefit of the doubt, once more....and not to mention 2 and a half hours of my life.....) maybe he isn't?"
"""Inglorious Basterds"" is a movie so clueless, so sloppy, so jam-packed full of half-ass characters and shock-value violence, so relentlessly terrible that I can't even muster the rage and indignation that most intelligent film fans feel toward Quentin Tarantino.I just pity him.American soldiers engaging in acts of deplorable violence against Nazi soldiers is not only justified- it's hilarious! And admirable. Just look at Hugo Stiglitz' statistics from the 1942-43 season in a flashback segment narrated by Samuel L. Jackson. Yes, Samuel L. Jackson. The idea that we're supposed to derive satisfaction from the torture of Nazis is just as abhorrent as a Nazi relishing the torture of a Jew. Let me tell Quentin something he should have learned in grade school: two loathsome evils do not make a right.Brad Pitt- one of my favorite actors- gives the worst performance of his career as a loudmouth macho bloodthirsty cartoon... I'll never look at him the same way again. He also looked particularly angry... for some reason I get the feeling he and Tarantino didn't quite get along. I can picture Brad slapping him silly between takes. Next time slap harder.Quentin has finally gone off the deep end and become the hack we all feared he would. He doesn't know if he's making a war movie, a parody of a war movie, an outrageous B-movie bloodbath or a documentary about milk & strudel. This is the definitive shrug by an artist who has nothing to say and insists on saying it loud.The one standout in the film is supposed to be Christoph Waltz as Col. Hans Landa, the icy, intelligent, brutally-violent Nazi commander. (There's a character we've never seen before.) His only crime seems to be the masterful use of conversation as an indirect threat of violence. The only reason for this of course is that Tarantino hasn't bothered to create any genuine tension or conflict, so we as an audience are forced to watch characters being forced to listen to Landa's menacing monologues. Dinner with a Nazi is scary enough... but by the time we get to his fifth interrogation I simply stopped caring.Who gets the award for worst stunt casting: human dingleberry BJ Novak from ""The Office"" or Mike Myers as British General Winthorp J. Starchington, III? I'd have to give the award to Myers, since his absurd makeup and wandering accent are funnier than Austin Powers on his best day.By the film's finale even the fundamentals of film-making have been abandoned and all sense of reality obliterated. We enter a small French movie theater so full of Nazi officers and SS propaganda that it might as well be Hitler's disco. Quentin has forgotten to introduce key characters earlier in the film, so now he compensates by scrawling their names in on-screen title cards, using hand-drawn arrows to identify them in the crowd shots. (Even with this pathetically sloppy device we have no idea who these people are- or why we should care.) Then Tarantino plays a David Bowie song on the soundtrack that was recorded 40 years after the film takes place! Your guess is as good as mine.A movie this awful does raise a lot of questions: Do most teenage refugees own and operate their own cinema? Are nonstop subtitles good for your eyes? Do war heroes play themselves in motion pictures? Do Nazis kidnap women and buy them dinner? Does Der Fuhrer pay full price for a matinée?Does a dying German soldier have just enough energy left to shoot our heroine? Would any high-ranking Nazi ever surrender to enemy soldiers after HE captured THEM? Should you try to masquerade as Italian when you can't speak the language?Was Hitler really gunned down in a movie theater?Of course not.Of course not.GRADE: F"
"I am sorry folks, but I have to say I really cannot understand the overwhelming feelings everybody gets by seeing this movie...When I saw it I looked at my watch to know how much more time I had to spend with this Kindergarten nonsense.So why this verdict?First of all: The movie tells a story that doesn't deliver any excitement! It is not even the amusingly distorted reality of a Quentin Tarantino we used to know. This story could have come out of every little kid's head. It doesn't have anything intelligent in it, neither anything inventive and it goes on for hours... the story has appropriate content for about 30 min. The rest is just awfully enhanced scenes that are supposed to leave a somewhat cool image. Doesn't work. Even the previously seen cutbacks that Tarantino often uses just confuse and are not in any way cool. Second: Some guys go to Germany and kill Nazis. Ah really? Do they? The only Nazis they killed were a handful of guys, one of them being man enough to rather die than betray his companions. Is this the ugly face Tarantino wanted to give the Nazis? A brave soldier that is more valiant than any of the ""Basterds""? Certainly not --> fail And what happens to the terrible Nazi-killing Basterds? Well they all get killed by Nazis except two who are taken hostages --> wow, what terrible revengeful monsters they are...Third: Any characters? Yes one! The only role and the only gleam of hope for the entire movie is Chritoph Waltz who is building a truly deep and very detailed character here. Great acting! Brad Pitt really sucks and is completely out-acted by Waltz. Never seen a such a weak performance by Pitt... And the rest? Well, some Germans you've never seen before and will never see after. When the movie started and I saw the group of the seven Basterds I hoped to see something like the ""Magnificent Seven"": A group of extraordinary guys, each one with a distinct character, making their way to their destiny fearless and knowing... I was then very disappointed, when I saw the ""inglourious Basterds"". No details at all, no characters, no real men, just some random guys you won't remember who were not given any chance to differentiate themselves... But in fact you don't even need to differentiate, cause the ""Inglourious Basterds"" except Pitt hardly play any role in this movie...So I was really disappointed, and seeing this movie on place #40 of the greatest movies of all time is the only thing about this, that leaves me with my mouth opened..."
"I can't imagine a director whose thirst for blood and violence is greater than Quentin Tarantino's. (At least in his films) Inglourious Basterds is no different. We all know Tarantino, the guy who exploded on the scene in the early 90s with cult classics, such as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Since, he has been a disappointment for some. Well, I am relieved to say, Tarantino has not lost his touch. He brings us his best since Pulp Fiction and thankfully so.We know the story, a WWII tale told only as Tarantino can. (Fictional of course) A war film hasn't been done like this before. Brad Pitt as Lt. Aldo Raine leads the Basterds in Nazi occupied France. Their goal - killin' Nazi's. Christoph Waltz as Colonel Hans Landa plays a similar role on the other side. He's know as the ""Jew Hunter"" and goes about his business as ruthless as no other. The third sub story consists of a young Jewish refugee, Shosanna Dreyfus, who witnesses the slaughter of her family. And she, of course, wishes to plot revenge on the Germans for her devastating lose. There actually is three stories here intertwining and connecting with each other. If you know anything about Tarantino or his films, this is nothing new for him.War has never been been so fun. The Basterds, are haunting, but at the same time, very funny, at times even hilarious. The dark comedy aspect play a big aspect in this as in many other Tarantino films. The entertainment and hilarity is led by Brad Pitt. I found him extremely funny and entertaining. I couldn't wait to see him on screen again. Even with his crazy accent, he works in this type of film. Also making great impressions were Mélanie Laurent and Christoph Waltz, who were tremendous. The film was filled with noteworthy performances.The story itself, has so many historical inaccuracies to even count, but so what? It isn't meant to be a documentary. Tarantino wanted to have fun with, as should we. The cinematography department deserves big props with beautiful vibrant colors highlighting the film. You've really got to love the last line in the film... but Pulp Fiction remains his masterpiece.Quentin Tarantino among all other things, is an entertainer. WWII, is one of the most tragic events in history, but Tarantino some how manages to make it fun. Inglourious Basterds is a fun film, it's tremendously entertaining, shocking, dramatic, suspenseful, and funny at the same time. Jam packed with everything you look for in a movie, done with that certain Tarantino style, it's worth being checked out. It's time to experience for yourself what war is like through the eyes of Quentin Tarantino."
"Inglorious Basterds makes no apologies, asks for no forgiveness, it's a  no holds barred assault on the senses. Tarantino doesn't care if he  offends, if he steps all over stereotypes and clichés, this is film  making at it purest. It's great to see a film maker whose work clearly  isn't interfeared with by the powers that be. Tarantino is a master of  effortlessly cranking up immense tension and suddenly mixing it with  laugh out loud moments; you're not sure if you should be looking away  in disgust or rolling around laughing, either way it's a roller coaster  and one not to be missed! It's not for everyone, certainly if you're not a fan of Tarantino's style, this may be a little hard to swallow, but  never-the-less, it is a film which simply has to be seen. No self  respecting film fan should miss this. And the performance of Christoph  Waltz... Oscar don't you dare ignore him!!"
"I simply cannot believe this movie's current rating on IMDb.It is currently sitting in the IMDb top 100, nestled closely with The Bridge on the River Kwai, Raging Bull and the Prestige.To find this movie in the same standing as those three is truly staggering to me. Hence I am taking the time to give this film 1 star, to hopefully help get it down towards its rightful place among the other pieces of truly worthless cinema with which it belongs.I can understand that this is a movie that you either love or hate - it is certainly true that it is both a provocative and original film. However, what surprises me is the massive bias towards the ""love"" side, given the film's content - which can be summarised as an unashamedly unrealistic and soulless collection of sadistic/casual mindless violence, strangely blended with dramatic scenes of the kind of things that genuinely took place under the Nazis.What I am trying to say is that combining very tense, well written SS interrogation scenes (which evoke some genuine emotional investment in the film) with comic book character British generals/Nazi leaders/Jewish soldiers makes for an extremely uncomfortable combination for me. At times it feels like someone has spliced together Schindlers List with Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.My best guess is that the film's originality and uncompromising approach is refreshing to people bored of the same old Hollywood formulae. Certainly the film is unpredictable. The plot (such as it is) is extremely meandering and many of the characters' actions are pretty much inexplicable. *SPOILER* (I point here towards Colonel Landa's killing of Bridget and his non-killing of Shosanna.) But then again every single character is so one dimensional that it leaves you with no idea which characters you are supposed to actually care about anyway. There is no real shock when anyone gets killed because you don't know who anyone is or what makes them tick.Brad Pitt gets the award here for the most wooden and pointless character to appear - he is truly awful throughout the film and finds himself in a role where he does not have to portray a single emotion throughout the film. Nothing.My final point is that originality on its own does not make a great film. Yes, Tarantino has made a movie where you see things that you have never seen before in a major Hollywood release, but that is not any sort of achievement. The reason a high budget film has not been made before where the entire German high command has a day at the cinema in occupied France with almost no guards or security is because that idea is stupid. Yes, the film is stupid - and no amount of brushing over with ""Tarantino is being postmodern"" or ""he's being ironic"" will overcome that plain fact.In summary this is a film that takes an exploitation film script, (that would ordinarily be filed under ""trash cinema"") gives it a big name director/very high quality cast and then takes the plaudits for being ground breaking.It is not. It is simply a steaming turd given a coat of gloss paint."
"Previous Tarantino movies were from a guy in love with other movies. This one is from a guy in love with his own writing. It isn't Inglorious, its disgusting.I absolutely hated Inglorious Basterds. The entire point of a film is to entertain - if u call bashing people's heads and removing their scalps entertaining!!!! - and if there is one unforgivable sin a movie can commit, it is extreme boredom or disgust.The movie is just a collection of endless and excruciatingly boring and disgusting scenes of people talking at tables in various languages. There is even one scene where 3 people talk for nearly 45 minutes at the same table, before, thankfully they are all shot. I wished they would have been killed off after 5 minutes. Even Woody Allen knows when to shut the F**K up.This table talk style is a Tarantino hallmark, but in other films, I actually cared about what they were saying and the people who were talking. Here, I couldn't care less. All of Quentin's films display an enormous confidence, particularly Jackie Brown. But here there is a pervasive feeling in every scene, Tarantino had no idea where he was going with the film.Is it violent? Sure there's torture and scalping galore, but you'd have to remind me. Thankfully, the film was so thin, I didn't even remember I had seen it earlier in the day when until I saw a review headline on MSNBC.He's out of gimmicks and apparently dying to write a novel. But do us a favor QT and spare us the movie.I walked out of this movie halfway through and I would never recommend anyone seeing it no matter what a die-hard quarantino fan he or she is.I give it 0 / 10."
"For those that have studied WWII, and unfortunately, seen real human brains on the ground, this movie is a travesty, a sadistic farce, and a complete waste of time like most of Tarantino's other questionable work. I do admit to liking ""Reservoir Dogs"" to a point. However, this thing does not even have an original title.I (unfortunately) received this DVD by mistake and see this project as a new low for Brad Pitt and the other actors taking part in this joke of making jews more barbaric than the Nazis. It perpetuates blame on the common German soldiers while covering up the major part US and UK bankers like Prescott Bush had in funding Hitler, as well as, the now confirmed part that British Intelligence had in bringing Hitler and Mussolini to power beginning immediately at the end of WWI.WWII was a complex and tragic event, and the real world history deserves better than this self serving, mythological blood feast served up for fools too lazy to look for the truth and try to prevent a recurrence. History can repeat itself when we become manipulated by propaganda, desensitized to inhumane actions, and self righteous.If you want to look at atrocities, many can argue that Stalin made Hitler and the Nazis look like rank amateurs in the business of murdering innocent people, as well as, the drug crazed gangs of Niger roping off streets with human intestines. Where does it end? We need to be getting the multitude of shadowy intelligence agencies under control and accountability instead of getting a cheap emotional thrill about perpetuating their myths in Hollywood and our capitol cities."
"I will never go to another Tarantino movie again. The entire film was worthless. My wife and I both regret that we didn't get up and walk out at the first indication of what the film was really going to be about (which is still hard to determine since it was such a ridiculous storyline...blood, guts, and violence seemed to be the only real theme), but we kept hoping there'd be something redeeming just around the corner. Unfortunately, there wasn't because there wasn't anything that made sense! We, along with a lot of the other people in the audience walked out of the theater muttering ""that was disgusting"", ""what a waste of time"", ""I should've walked out"", ""where was the comedy"", ""that was pathetic"", etc. It actually made us, the audience, voice our disgust and the feeling that we had just been thoroughly ripped off. The only thing of merit in the film was the costuming and the acting ability of almost everyone in the film....there just wasn't a plot/script worthy of their talents. I rate this a 1 because there isn't a 0. I can't quite understand how anyone could rate this higher than a 0!"
"Reviews of this film are largely split into 2 camps; it's good because, or it's bad despite, it's direction by Tarantino.The question I asked myself after this was would this have been made without the Pitt/ Tarantino stamp? The answer was no; and the result was a film that made me so irate that I was moved to post my first review on IMDb...I found everything about this film treated the film goer with something approaching contempt. The script was thin with the exception of one well written character - Landa. Scripting for other characters was anodyne or non-existent, or, in the case of the ""Jew-Bear"", simply a bit weird. Same for the other aspects of characterisation, that was formulaic and thin in nearly every case, especially the made-for-Pitt Aldo Raine and the other Basterds. Style pastiching that normally works didn't; subject matter was treated with either insufficient levity or indifference; scenes were badly edited or irrelevant. The redeeming aspects were cinematography and production values - style over content.So - am I taking it too seriously? No; this is not a funny film (though occasionally it seems to try) and the violence that is shown sits uneasily between cartoonish and unnecessary - a prime example is that of the surrendered German who was beaten to death; added nothing, in any way. In fact the tone of the film was so inconsistent in the way it considered the material that it made me very uneasy.For me - Tarantino needs to start making films to impress others, not just himself. Obviously (most of) the rest of the world disagrees, but that's something either Mr T or I will have to learn to live with...One of the most disappointing films I've seen."
"Very entertaining, that's for sure. Great little moments ""inspired"" by other movies. ""The Guns Of Navarone"", ""Operation Crossbow"" and a myriad of 70's B exploitation Italian movies. Tarantino is certainly clever and knows how to use the camera but then, I have to say it, nothing. The childish ""divertimento"" dressed in smart ass dialog remains there. The entertainment value is, perhaps, the most one should expect from a movie but it seems a damn shame that such a talent should be put at the service of something so one dimensional. I can't help but remember Ernst Lubitch's ""To Be Or Not To Be"" that was also a comedy with remarkable, inventive dialog but it also had so many other layers that ""To Be Or Not To Be"" after 70 years still resonates with whoever has seen it. Christoph Waltz is terrific and Brad Pitt is always great fun to watch but the experience is purely epidermic in spite of some truly gruesome moments. Am I expecting oranges from an apple tree? If that's so forget what I've just said and run to meet Tarantino's basterds."
"You should hear the Italian critics talking about Tarantino and ""Inglorious Bastards"". They run out of superlatives. One of them last night actually shouted ""Tarantino is my God"". Wow! I, personally, suspect that Tarantino is the result of a generation of TV and bad (now cult) exploitation movies. I enjoy him, don't get me wrong, but I'm not shouting miracle when I still have ""The Great Escape"", for instance, so fresh in my mind. ""Inglorious Basterds"" more than any of the other Tarantino films is all about appearances. There is nothing underneath other than references to other movies. Nothing wrong with that in fact I like it but I refuse to treat Quentin Tarantino as a sort of Deity. I can't buy it. I think he should be placed exactly where he belongs among the best of his kind but what kind is that? Never mind, it works. Italian critics who are so prepared to destroy their own - you should read some of the reviews for ""Baaria"" - are prepared to fall to their knees in front of Tarantino. This are the same critics that last year, the year of ""Milk"", ""Slumdog Millionaire"" ""Edge Of Heaven"", The Wrestler"" etc, gave the David de Donatello Award for best picture to ""Grand Torino"" I want to make sure that I'm making my point clearly. ""Inglorious Bastards"" is a terrific comedy with most of Tarantino's trademark tricks in place. You'll have a great time with Brad Pitt and an incredible Christoph Waltz as the ultimate Nazi villain but don't expect a masterpiece as declared by some critics. That kind of review damages the film and me the spectator. It forces something on me. As if I was suppose to feel the same otherwise there is something wrong with me. No. I liked it, I recommend it for what it is. Period."
"... would you have seen it ? The first scene was very inviting and promising, with a fabulous Waltz and Menochet, and then it slips into the third dimension. A Jewish woman with a black young man managing a cinema (or whatever shop), in France in the middle of the 40s ??? Hitler's attending somewhere without tight security of Leibstandarte SS ??? Where do they all get tailor made smokings in a few hours time, all that, without people noticing that they can't talk french or German ??? You are kidding me. What's the point of this movie ? It has no historic value, no humor, nothing. WWII is a serious matter. This film is an insult to all our parents and grandparents who lost their lives to fight the evil. At least, I would have preferred if there were no reference to historic characters."
"Countless Historical & cultural mistakes 0/10(1) A Jewish guy named OMAR!!! Hahahaha (2) Brilliant detective was taking out by the least intelligent guy in the movie! (3) Jewish suicide bombers!! That was funny. (4) Hitler and his top guns went to watch a movie downtown Paris!!! With two guards at the door. !! shoot me. (5) Brad Pitt overacted and it was painful to watch him. (6) Mr. QT is re-writing history, ""Hitler was killed in a theatre really!"" the funny thing about this is that people ""and I mean stupid people"" will actually believe this plot. And finally can any one tell me, how this movie made it to the top 250 movies of all time!!! Shame shame shame, still wondering how can anyone like this movie."
"Tarantino continues to make idiotic cartoons that at best glorify and at worst encourage violence. Next time there's a mass shooting somewhere, consider whether movies like this one have made violence fashionable, dramatic, cool, newsworthy, glorious or even a little less than totally unacceptable.Suspension of disbelief can't possibly include fantasizing that the Nazis would be stupid enough to send all four of its top leaders into a tiny Jewish-run cinema in Paris. Comic book authors usually won't insult their readers to that extent. On the contrary, they tend to write with a level of logic and intelligence far above Tarantino.Production, acting, music, cinematography in the film are very good, but they can't counteract the insipid premise, plot, and overall concept. Speaking of music, the borrowed Morricone pieces are very good, but the rock, r&b, etc., are totally out of place and tear down the facade of a period piece.Similarly, Christoph Waltz as SS detective Hans Landa gave an amazing performance which was ruined by psychotic leaps out of character as written by Tarantino. Yes it showed Waltz's amazing acting range, but it also destroyed the integrity of his character.There are numerous ""artistic"" continuity errors in the film, no doubt created to give a cleaner looking shot. When Landa strangles von Hammersmark, both of their chairs mysteriously disappear. When Raine carves Landa's forehead, Landa's handcuffs disappear so he can grasp at the grass in pain, etc. Again this reinforces the notion that these are comics, and rather bad ones at that."
"The acting is overacting. The plot does not exist. The story is completely unbelievable. This is fiction with over-fictional elements brought in a semi-serious setting. A farmer hiding Jews in the basement, being ""interrogated"" friendly by a Nazi, while the guards wait outside, they come in later and shoot them all and let one escape. That is a bad start. It is stupid. The stupidity does not end. This was not a funny movie, this was not satire, this was not entertainment, this was a long long list of stupid scenes, one unbelievable plot hole after another. An insult to history, an insult to every intelligent movie-lover. I was mad after seeing this. I really do not understand why people give compliments to this movie. Really."
"I am witnessing a decrease of IQ in scripts and directing over the last 20 years in Hollywood. Never quite liked Tarantino movies but I have to say I always enjoyed a good plot and believable acting (Pulp Fiction).I hate the thing that nower days anyone can be a script writer and a director. This movie should be offending for a man with IQ over 85.The conversation is childish, there is not one thing that makes this movie believable in any way.I will not even begin to relate to the bad acting. But hey, what can you expect from an actor playing a ridiculous f--ked up character?! I will end it here: the worst thing in this movie is the gratuitous violence that marks the long conversation scenes.And mister Tarantino, if you are a homicidal maniac in abeyance, if you have money, fame, and many important friends does'n't mean that the rest of us will enjoy your twisted gratuitous violence. Please, keep your maniacal impulses for yourself and don't poison us with it.You should come forward and appologise to the German people. I have a few German friends and they are not a bunch of drunks, idiots, sadistic killers as descripted in your sick joke of a movie.As a human being I am offended of this movie and others like it and think that the world should stand up against this kind of gratuitous violence and movies like this one should be thrown away to the trash can where they belong."
"PLOT (or lack thereof): A group of Jewish American soldiers, led by Brad Pitt, go overseas to during World War 2 to terrorize and massacre Nazis while a Jewish cinema owner, the only survivor of her family, having barely escaped a German soldier known as ""The Jew Hunter"" played Christopher Waltz, who now plots to have her revenge when a film about a German sharp shooter is forced upon her to debut at her theater, while Waltz plans defection.The film is really nothing but another exercise on director Quentin Tarantino's part to see just how much useless dialogue he can cram into a scene and see how long he can drag a scene out before the audience gives up and turns the film off (similar to his misguided ""Death Proof""). Where Tarantino's earlier films, affectionate deconstructions of the noir genre, had enough chaotic energy to keep the viewer engaged while his characters blathered nonsense, much of it pop culture and cinema laced, this time around, like Death Proof, Tarantino fails to bring any of that lost energy to the proceedings. The film is dull, inert, and lifeless. Scenes drag on pointlessly with no real tension, in no small part because the characters are cardboard cut outs. Even Christopher Waltz's much ballyhooed and frankly overrated performance as the ""Jew Hunter"" Nazi fails to set off any sparks. The fact that the character is more annoying than interesting doesn't help.Brad Pitt and his ""Basterds"" aren't even in the film that much. While the marketing campaign suggested a darkly comic take on the Magnificent Seven formula, the truth is the that Pitt and the ""Basterds"" are barely plot devices.Trust me, you won't miss much by skipping this inglorious mess."
"We were really looking forward to this movie and after we watched it, we were glad that we hadn't rushed off to pay for it. Terrible movie. I don't know what Tarantino was trying to do. Usually a stickler for detail, this movie appears to be an offering trading on name only - ie., let's see what crap we can edit together and people will still buy it because it's a Tarantino movie. Given this theory - there a lot of fools giving way too high a rating in here. Were you drunk people? No joke. In the past, after watching a Tarantino movie there has been so much to think back on - when this one was over, I was irritated that I'd wasted my time. There is NOTHING clever about it. SPOILER: The reason they get caught out is because of the shoe (and their own dead men) left behind in the bar after the shootout. Now the Basterds have been ANAL perfectionists in their operation throughout the movie and suddenly they neglect to clean the scene?? Not a chance. Sorry. Useless product. Disgusting quality. If you already have enough money Mr Tarantino, just stop making movies - I for one won't ever be paying for another of yours."
"Hooray for Title Misspellings! After reading reviews and contemplating, my girlfriend and I confirmed that this movie is an utter piece of trash. This movie lost her as one of those Rare Tarantino fans.I wish it were made on nitrate film, and all the copies piled neatly underneath a chain-smoking Tarantino fanboy. The literally needless violence, the plot holes, Tarantino's table-itis sans drama, and absent character development made this a thoroughly painful, glorified montage. What acting was there? And how much of that was just because I was too busy reading the subtitles? I watch my share of fansubbed anime, and kudos for the attempt at authenticity, but it was overdone for an English-language movie. With the glaring historical inadequacies, the constant reading killed what acting there was.Why pay money for a narrator who will have absolutely no tie to any of the characters, plot, themes, setting, or anything involved in the movie? When the movie needs that sort of off hand explanation, it's foreshadowing the utter filth that follows.Historical Research - while it was sprinkled with interesting factiods, used the proper costumes and props for the soldiers, this movie stretched the truth beyond belief even for historical fiction. Kudos on Mata Hari reference, though using it as foreshadowing was a bit much. Mata Hari was executed by a firing squad, not choked in an isolated room. This ruined any sense that the reference may have had.Other reviews mention more than half a dozen homages to other artists in the first 15 minutes. Considering the audience, all these and other references were completely lost on many who would bother to see this movie, and all who would enjoy it.I'm confused by his choices of when to start a scene, end it, and what needs to be included. In a movie promoted as an action film, why did it take nearly 20 minutes to set up any sort of testosterone? What I believe to be the message was trite. The idea of rats and how we act on a primal nature against them, and ""who is the rat?"" were at best clichéd, but at worst not realized. Mention of American camps for the Japanese and German Americans would have added legitimacy to this question to the moral high ground. Literally every character in the film that gets a speaking role was caught up in their own legend. Is that the world in which Tarantino lives?I'm glad I didn't pay to see this one. I regret that I bothered to view it at all, even with well-meaning hosts. There was a rich base of ideas to develop, but none were realized."
"Too many morons will believe this is a factual film and those idiots will pass it on as such. It is an insult to the veterans of WWII, and an insult to the intelligence of film goers. The trailer for the film is a piece of misleading garbage that has little to do with the film, and the group portrayed in the trailer should have been called ""The Inglourious Idiots"". Added to all the above is the fact that too many Hollywood drug addicts think that having most of the film in a foreign language makes it a better film. That just proves that much of the Hollywood crowd is a bunch of snobbish, self-important, elitist, and truly uncreative a**es that do not know how to make a good film. I have never been more disappointed in a film. The high point of the movie is Brad Pitt (Angelina Jolie's live-in). His pitiful imitation of the Billy Bob Thornton (One of Angelina's many former squeezes)character in ""Slingblade"" was hilarious. The attempt to copy Billy Bob is soooooo bad that Pitt should be at the top of the list for that ""Rotten Tomato"" award.. Sheesh, when will film makers try to actually make a good film again. Of the last 100 I've watched, there have been two I'd like to see again. This one is 101 on the list..."
"""Inglourious Basterds"" is supposed to be Quentin Tarantino's homage to the Spaghetti Western. And here's what is interesting: Tarantino has had 40 years to improve on Sergio Leone's 1960s masterpieces. And he's failed miserably.""Basterds"" is a rambling, incoherent mess of a movie. It's obvious that Tarantino desperately wants to be the ultimate ""bad boy"" of cinema who makes ""controversial"" films. But if Tarantino really wanted to be controversial in making a war film, he'd tackle the horrors of the Iraq War, instead of World War II, a long-ago war that already has been re-hashed over and over from every conceivable angle over the decades.Tarantino deeply wants to shock us, to outrage us and to create disturbing art. And he fails miserably. The fact is, Leone was infinitely more daring and controversial way back in 1968 than Tarantino ever has been. When Leone depicted the vicious cold-blooded gunning down of a child in ""Once Upon a Time in the West,"" he created a scene that Tarantino would never, ever have the courage to film. Compared to scenes like that, everything in ""Basterds"" is tame and predictable (as is the case with all of Tarantino's work).Last, but not least, I really can't understand why anyone would be interested in Tarantino's take on the 1960s Spaghetti Western film genre. I mean, why not just watch the stunning originals? The original Italian directors did vastly more with their tiny budgets than Tarantino can do with his bloated $80 million budgets.If you want truly challenging and original film-making these days, I urge you to check out the best of what East Asian cinema has to offer. (Takashi Miike is infinitely more daring, dangerous and talented than Tarantino). Tarantino is a grossly overrated director and the fact that his work is praised in the U.S. shows just how utterly creatively bankrupt Hollywood is these days."
"I attended a showing of this movie locally at the invitation of friends. If this had not been the case I would probably have left without seeing it in it's entirety. I feel uncomfortable living under the same sky with people who would not only take this bit of fluff seriously but actually like it. I didn't appreciate the story line due to having such difficulty with the subject matter, the chauvinism etc.Believe it or not all members of the German Army were not Nazis (members of the Nazi Party) Also if you could consider the history of WW2 dispassionately you would conclude that soldiers of the Elite German Units such as Leibstandarte SS Adolph Hitler,Das Reich, Standarte Viking,Grossdeutschland, etc. Were among the best (if not the best) Soldiers of the 20th Century.You would see this in their performance and also in the making of the man. What makes a good Soldier? Equipment,Training,Leadership, and Motivation. Brad Pit in my estimation is indeed a twit for getting involved in this grotesque imitation of a film.Anyone who makes light of the German Army of the third Reich lacks knowledge and intelligence. Please don't anyone give him my regards."
"I must admit when I saw the preview for ""Inglorious Basterds"" I gave myself big expectations. THIS FILM DID NOT Disappoint.Rarely when I watch a movie with such high-expectations do I have those expectations met or exceeded; this film did that and more. Even more rarely do I clap at the end of a movie, this I and everyone else in the theater did.I have to say I am a little biased towards Quentin, I grew up with ""Pulp Fiction."" I watched it when I was 12 and it is still my favorite and most influential film.However, since then Quentin has not really lived up to his billing. His style was getting a little predictable instead of familiar, the quality honestly wasn't there (I never watched Jackie Brown, and then there's Grindhouse). That is until ""Inglorious Basterds."" What Quentin did was exactly what was needed for the war genre, a spaghetti western feel that could only be done by Tarantino or Sergio Leone, but seeing how Leone is dead, Tarantino's the self appointed guy on this masterpiece.So let's look at the movie which I won't give away. The writing was spot on, a beautiful transition between using not one but four different languages in this movie. Not to mention this movie was set up in the classic Tarantino mold, great scenes of rich meaningful dialog and sudden shocking action.The acting was superb!! Christopher Waltz deserves an Oscar, seriously. I don't say that often, but honestly the man should get one for this movie, he spoke every language in this movie, and delivered with such amazing touch and poise. He stole the show in a movie that everybody was amazingly impressive.I have no problem building this movie up, because this movie is the best film I've seen all year, and probably all of next year. Quite frankly the more I think about it, this movie may crack my top films of all time, and is Quentin's best movie since ""Pulp Fiction."" Take it from me, watch this film. I loved it doesn't do this movie enough justice.I watched it yesterday and I'm still blown away. Thank you Quentin from the bottom of my heart for you making this movie. You're back on top again buddy. I can't say enough for ""Inglorious Basterds!"""
"Every movie Quentin Tarantino has made has become progressively worse. I'd like to believe that most people would agree with that statement, but seeing as ""Inglourious(sic) Basterds(sic)"" has an 8.5/10 from over 100,000 ratings, it doesn't seem like the general movie-going public has any sense. Even his best work, Reservoir Dogs, wasn't a 'masterpiece.' The trouble is that claiming that you like Tarantino's work has become trendy. As soon as that happens, you get boatloads of people ready and willing to hop on another bandwagon. They will ignore laughably terrible acting, and utterly self-indulgent writing just so they can be part of the exclusive club called ""everyone."" This movie is so terrible, that I swear it must be some sort of twisted joke by Tarantino to see how much torture his fans will tolerate and still praise him. Like another reviewer has already said: ""Previous Tarantino movies were from a guy in love with other movies. This one is from a guy in love with his own writing."" I couldn't agree more. This movie is nothing more than self-indulgent and in-joke riddled writing paired with acting ability taken right out of a high school play. But, thanks to the general movie going public, I'm sure it will still go down as one of the best movies ever made. Bravo, Tarantino. You've pulled-off one of the best practical jokes of all time."
"This movie is one of my top ten (worst movies ever made), I mean this is the first movie I'm writing a review for because I don't understand how can you people like it- maybe we are not from a same planet or something like that, but if the whole movie is about making fun of Hitler&Co and in a most stupidest way possible, then yes, it is an awesome movie, but otherwise... I'm certain that Guebels movie from this movie would be better, and if this movie won an Oscar, then I think that academy award is for marking the movie that you would not like to watch, at least if your IQ is above 80, and you don't laugh like an idiot on every joke with point that is so obvious to everyone in 0.005 seconds... Anyway, just my opinion, feel free to disagree, hate it, or just call me moron, I don't care... :)"
So I balanced it out. This review is too short but its too the point. Watch it. Judge it yourself.
"This is the worse movie I have watched in a long, long, time. The Weinsteins should provide a carload of toilet paper for the viewer who paid money to sit through this.Quentin Tarantino has proved himself the equal of Just Jaeckin as a writer/director with this effort. I can honestly say I've heard my five year old nephew generate better stories and dialogue than this abortion of puerile immature unlettered lack of imagination and talent.Quentin, save your money. You'll need it to pay viewers of your films. in the future.How bad was the film, I suspect the cast and crew have carpal tunnel syndrome from writing these reviews. No one who watched the movie and is not making money off of it could possibly give it more than one star. It was like watching a 2 1/2 hr. car accident.I would rather go see a prequel to Heaven's Gate. The only saving grace was that I didn't pay money for the experience.Skip this movie, and I use the term movie very, very, loosely."
"This movie is a joke for our history... is Quentin Tarantino some how stupid? he got Adolf Hitler killed in a movie theater in his movie?!? Very poor in landscaping...it's filmed like a cheap novice movie...nothing extraordinary except the magic performance from Christoph Waltz, which indeed was the best character in this average film. By the way please send Brad Pitt to his wife and God make him do Legend's of the Fall again or something similar because the priest at my church looks more fierce than his role here. Please don't vote for a poor screenplay which has made the history of WW2 a joke... and for my beloved Quentin, stay to Pulp Fiction because it was a masterpiece...not a low quality ""dream"" like this one."
"This was by far the worst and sickest Tarantino film I've seen, and I've seen all but one. It's an ungainly mix of cartoony revenge fantasy and sub-Eli Roth torture porn. The Basterds roam around France without any apparent source of supplies, ammunition, or command of any language other than English. Their actions are hideous, scalping bodies (with vivid sound effects and exposed brains), carving swastikas in foreheads..slowly.., sticking fingers in bullet holes, yet these are the good guys and the torture is played for laughs. Tarantino doesn't know any difference between ordinary (e.g. drafted) German soldiers and Nazis, and thus any amount of carving up is OK as long as it's done by Jews or their redneck leader. I guess he thinks it'd be equally OK if the Germans scalped American bodies and carved stars in their foreheads? Tarantino is good at dialog and set pieces, but fails to weave them together into a coherent narrative. There are basically two revenge fantasies coming together in the Paris movie premiere, but neither one affects the other. There is zero character establishment or development. We're not told how a penniless Jewish girl came to own a fabulous movie theater a few years later in occupied Paris, or even how she established a false identity. None of the Basterds have separable personalities or life histories (we don't even find out why Aldo has a rope burn on his neck). Compare and contrast with ""The Dirty Dozen.""The climactic premiere sequence is so absurd it's not even laughable. Sometime after the Allied invasion (which is never referred to, although we've been told it's June 1944), the entire German high command takes off for a gala film event in Paris, about 300 miles from the front lines (it's not like they had any pressing business). At the theater, Hitler is protected by a grand total of TWO guards. When you can't even be as realistic as a Mel Brooks movie (""To Be or Not To Be""), you're just insulting the audience. I've seen better security at the library.Hmm, what else? Why aren't the Basterds surprised when the theater catches on fire? That wasn't part of their plan. Why did Landa completely lose control and strangle the actress? It's wildly out of character from every other scene. If he's angry she's a traitor, he already has it in mind to become an even bigger traitor himself. Why does every German they meet speak English? What was the point of scalping the driver at the end? The war was about to be over, who were they trying to freak out? Does Tarantino even know what Goebbels looked like?I could go on, but it's like picking apart the physics of Bugs Bunny. It's a spectacle of Tarantino acting out his man-child, which unfortunately gets taken as a daring alternate history."
"Before i start with this comment... let me assure you that i am a Q.Tarantino fan and i loved Pulp fiction and Reservoir dogs. i also don't mind the bloodshed and gore in his or Eli Roth movies. I was overjoyed when i heard about Brat Pitt in the movie., and believe me i waited for this movie for about 4-6 months.And... i was totally disappointed. This movie is just historically incorrect in many ways.. but also an insult to human intelligence.STORY: OK., i will agree that there is no RULE for a movie be historically correct or to show who is good or bad., i will surely enjoy Nazis getting tortured in a fictional comic book story... but u cant forget the fact that the person in the story is Hitler and he is at least a leader of country which terrified the whole world.If he and most of his important generals are guarded by 2 men is one joke., then to kill him., the whole of Britain, Russian and their own German resistance who have been trying infiltrate into his inner security fail., a small group of Jewish Americans with a terribly acted leader Brad Pitt achieve this? oh.. i forgot.., it is the Americans who save us from Aliens to terrorists(who keep changing from time to time).. and now even from Nazi Hitler?Screenplay: I really enjoyed the conversations between characters in both reservoir dogs and pulp fiction( i have not seen jackie brown)., but here.. i was bored. i waited and waited for that one interesting bit, but it never came.The only consolation might be pretty brilliant acting by Christoph Waltz and pretty good picture and sets.Basically i dint find any part funny and was very much bored., not once or twice., but 10 times.. in all those patches... a big disappointment to me..,"
"Wow, what a terrible movie. Slight spoilers, not that there's much to spoil.The entire movie feels like an adolescent fantasy. Actually that's too harsh - I don't think even a 5 year old could come up with such stupidity. OK, fine, caricature Nazis and make the Jews blood hungry revenge psychos, but at least do it with some intelligence and flair. Close up of the guy's face as he guns down trapped women is just not too interesting. I'm not offended, I just find it plain stupid.Tarantino, you're delving into dangerously unwatchable territory. Even Dusk Till Dawn was better that this. Please find your way back, I used to enjoy your stuff."
"I'm not a film buff but I do watch films regularly and I have greatly enjoyed all of Tarantinos films to date.This film only succeeds on one level - cinematography. It fails on every other level - script, costume, storyline etc... The editing stood out as being particularly bad.The whole film lacked pace and direction which was unexpected as that is pretty much what Tarantino is know for and to date did it well.The last scenes with Brad Pitt beside the bloke from 'the office' well, I just had to remind myself that Brad Pitt wasn't being paid over 10 million to do this film and the bloke standing beside him was probably doing it for free.I also didn't quite get the NAZI Jewish thing.Everyone knows that Hitler killed millions of Jews, Poles, Gypsies, Invalids, Catholics, Communists, old people etc ... Less than Stalin though. Perhaps one of the new Russian billionaires will finance a film about stalin? And it is still true, as in the film, that Jewish people run the movie making industry in America so where is the irony? So for Tatantino as an American film director it wasn't exactly pushing the envelope to make a film about jews getting revenge on Hitler.It isn't an awful film, it's just well, not a good film and borders on being a bad film."
"I'm astonished that this film made the top 250 -- indeed, at time of this writing, number 84. I'm guessing that a number of the reviews are written by one-view enthusiasts who haven't very deep roots in film history or film criticism.I was tempted to rate the film at one star just to even things out, but that wouldn't be honest. There are two scenes in this movie that are striking and worthy -- the opening scene where Christopher Walz (Col. Landa) was looking for hidden Jews, and the second when a number of the ""Basterds"" are in a cellar pub trying to make contact with a defecting actress, but are interrupted by unforeseen events. Both scenes, really, are at times breathtaking.But the rest of the film varies between maudlin, unbelievable (even on the terms of its own alternative history) and just plain boring. The references to other films and directors (Hugo Stiglitz? Give me a break!), not to mention the comic book-style titles and all that were really wearying.How many of you think this is really a better film than ""Rebecca""? Or ""The Wizard of Oz""? I thought we only had grade inflation in higher ed ...I can't imagine this film will improve on second viewing, and there is absolutely nothing about it that invites such an investment of my time."
"When I saw the trailers for Inglorious Basterds, I was less than impressed. I have a (very) soft spot in my heart for Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, but the movie seemed ridiculous. So I watched it with very low expectations. I sadly found out that I was correct in my assumptions. The movie manages to feel like 5 hours and still be very thin, both in plot and characterization. Tarantino tried to cram in a 12 hours long movie into 150 minutes and it failed - miserably. The Basterds storyline is by far the weakest. We are treated to a short speech about the Nazi killers, a few few short scenes and montages and then the final massacre at the theater. I feel that Tarantino would have been better off leaving them as shadowy figures in the background, as a real band of vengeful and silent assassins, instead of making them appear as unlikable cretins. Give them less screen time, but make it count. The Shosanna storyline is as thin, but at least Laurent's character's back story is given to the viewer (in parts, at least). The love story with Marcel also felt tacked on at all moments. What is even sadder is that the movie started out great. The farm scene is up there with Tarantino's best offerings. Much of that praise can be attributed to Waltz's performance as Lauda which is simply stunning and frightening. Too bad the movie started going downhill afterward, what with wooden 40 minutes dialogs (nothing new for Tarantino there, but at least the long conversations used to be funny or clever) and superfluous/masturbatory references that only served to remind the viewer that he was watching a QT flick.Still, the movie merits a viewing if only for Col. Lauda, but it certainly won't become a classic."
"Whenever Quentin Tarantino feels the need to share his imagination with us, we get treated to a film. Sometimes it works, as in Pulp Fiction. Other times, as in Inglorious basterds, we wish he kept his fantasies to himself.Without giving too much away, Tarantino has created a film where the survivor of her family's massacre at the hands of Nazis is an unsympathetic character. The title characters are unknown, mere bit players. As they enter the theatre we don;t really care if they will live or die. We have the traditional Mexican stand-off, a staple of Tarantino when he is too lazy to be creative. A German war hero becomes smitten with the owner of the theatre, the survivor of the family tragedy. He tries to woo her, and when she tells him that she is not interested, for about the fourth time, he suddenly becomes aggressive and completely out of character....but at least out of character is better than no character at all, as the players in this movie drift in and out of dialogue without displaying any sense of who they are.For a movie to run two and a half hours, one would think the characters would be well defined and make us care about them. One wonders just what the hell Tarantino spent his time on...endless chatter that amounted to one third of the film's plot, repeated ad nauseum in three languages."
"I had to give this a vote which suggests that it's worth something so I'd firstly request that the IMDb mob do a thumbs voting method and this film most certainly gets the thumbs down from me.I would also like to say that thankfully, I am not the only one who doesn't rate this film and I'm puzzled to see why it has such a high rating considering this.The opening section was very good, had me gripped and wanting more, what a shame then that QT had to ruin it with the rest of the tripe that I sat through - I've watched it twice, the first time before giving up, I made it to the bar scene in which drunken soldiers spill beer over the uniforms of SS officers, I don't think many officers would stand for that kind of behaviour but anyway, I digress.I couldn't watch any more, the acting from a good majority of the cast was awful, the plot was woeful suited more to an 8 year old playing with his soldiers and conjuring up amazing ways to win the war and I also found it tasteless, wishing that Aldo, the Bear and the other miscreants could have been killed in an earlier scene by the German soldier who, when questioned what his medal ribbon was for, provided an answer for a virtue lacking in any of the captors before him.Yes, heroes die and quite often at the hands of unlikeable characters and sometimes the unsavoury ones get away with it but surely, should I really be hating the Americans for the entire film after that?I did give this a second attempt, after all, a lot of films demand a re watch so I thought I'd give this another chance, I wish I hadn't, it's mindless pi-sh for mindless people.If there's to be anymore WWII output (or any other war for that matter) from QT, I would suggest he purchase himself a pile of 1960/70's Commando comics, the plot lines within are far more realistic and for a bonus, some of them are actually true stories."
"as someone already pointed out, a 1 star rating for this movie is to much.this movie not only destroys the image that i had of quentin, based on Pulp fiction, Kill Bill, but it disgusts me at an extent that i felt i had to register to express it.this is an offence to all the German people out there, a terrible spit in the face of all WW2 events. i know jews suffered and needed to take revenge on the Nazis and the German people, but come on, it's been almost 70 years since the events, move on.there is so much gratuitous violence, so many disgusting scenes that i felt sick to my stomach. and i deeply enjoyed PF and Kill Bill..i honestly see nothing witty, funny or insightfull about this movie (apart from that almost brilliant performance by Waltz), it is simply the most overrated (much worst than hurt locker) piece of trash i have ever had the bad luck to watch."
"The failure of ""Inglourious Basterds"" is the failure of ""Death Proof"" and the ""Kill Bill"" films. After ""Jackie Brown"" Tarantino jettisoned any concern with gripping storytelling and decided to focus on constructing fan-boyish collages, like an amateur film maker recreating his favorite moments from the movies. Perhaps though this change of direction for Tarantino isn't merely a matter of choice–he may simply be burned out in terms of generating story ideas. After all, one can't be gifted in every facet. Tarantino can direct and construct involving, musical dialog–but the man may no longer be capable of originating good stories, and his best work — Pulp Fiction — may have been a fluke as far as HIS contribution to the story of the film is concerned. After all, Roger Avery wrote a third of the script, though he merely gets a ""stories"" co-credit. ""Reservoir Dogs"" lifted its most important plot and story elements from the Hong Kong film ""City On Fire"" from the late 80s. And ""Jackie Brown"" — his second best work — was an adaptation of a work by a writer who Tarantino drew a lot of inspiration from. But Tarantino has given several interviews in which he claimed that he is very distanced from ""Jackie Brown,"" a distance that no doubt stems from the fact that when audiences see it they can't help but appreciate Elmore Leonard as much as Tarantino. In Hollywood, the writer-director is the most prestigious position. But many of the greatest directors have, of course, depended for ideas on novelists and screen-writers. Perhaps Tarantino doesn't care to stoop so low as them again.In Kill Bill, what happened to the Bride, and her subsequent quest, was largely goofy. Rather than taking a true risk and making an actual film which involved revenge, Tarantino chose a cheaper, satirical route, so that the revenge quest was treated so satirically and frivolously as to preempt any criticism of the film's plot or characters, i.e, the ""it's bad on purpose!"" defense. The only way to criticize the film was to take issue with the whole cold exercise and observe that Tim Roth getting shot in the stomach in ""Reservoir Dogs"" and the audience squirming in their seats as he bled profusely was preferable to Sofie Fatale getting her arm chopped off and the audience laughing.There is no good story in Inglourious Basterds either, and just as in Kill Bill the revenge and dealing out of justice are treated too outlandishly to be taken seriously as plots. It isn't that the lack of seriousness which undermines the story but that the lack of seriousness covers up the poor nature of the storytelling. We are asked to accept the premise of The Basterds solely on the basis of such a group of characters having been featured in World War 2 films previously. There is no reason for the ""Basterds"" to be comprised primarily of Jews except that Tarantino requires it to fit in with the revenge theme. And it is not required that the film be replete with overt verbal allusions to cinematic figures other that Tarantino wants to be too cute by half.The use of chapter breaks in Pulp Fiction elegantly delineated the separate plot threads. Tarantino in Inglourious Basterds (and in Kill Bill) has become dependent on chapter breaks as a way to cut into any scene without having to get there through a narrative. Why establish the details of how Shoshana came to possess her a new identity and a theater? Just cut to the exact place the character needs to be to enact her revenge! Why, indeed, bother with the details of how to get from one set piece to another? Just give each one it's own ""chapter"" to relieve the director/writer and the audience of the bothersome details of a smooth narrative.Gratuitousness abounds. We aren't shown the bodies of the murdered Jews, yet we're given full view of the scalping of Nazi soldiers. Did Tarantino think that the former undercut his whole ""lolzviolence!"" shtick? In two instances a narrator intrudes and embellishes arbitrary details. Michael Fassbender's character is painstakingly introducedonly to lamely die the next scene. Tarantino kills of Shoshana in an anti-climatic fashion just so he can resurrect her on the big screen. Two of the Basterds get so carried away in pummeling the Nazis at the theater with bullets that they forget the bombs they're strapped to, but just why they would be suicidal isn't made clear.But it doesn't make sense, I suppose, to get too worked up over any of its details. As said before, the only recourse is to question the whole exercise and the artistic dead-end it represents. The films of the post-Jackie Brown Tarantino will not inspire anyone. They are the products of a fearful film maker aware that, like Orson Wells, he made his greatest film too young. And rather than settling into a comfortable routine of Jackie Brown like films–i.e, substantive and effective thrillers not stylistically overdone based on novels or screenplays not by him– he has opted to produce a flow of pastiches whose failure on a storytelling and character level critics won't hold him accountable for due to the -mere exercise- nature of the films. But at least he gets sole credit."
"I really like Brad Pitt. I like QT as well.This movie however... Oh my god, I had relatively high hopes and was severely disappointed.There were aspects of it that were very entertaining...Oh say the first 30 seconds of 20 minute long conversations in the theater or bar. (Ok I'm estimating, probably high... but really were you trying to put me to sleep????) What probably irks me most though, is the shootout in the bar.I don't really think the other table knows what is going on, yet the second the shooting starts at ""our"" table, all those soldiers are up and shooting. The whole thing goes down in what, 2-3 seconds? Are soldiers trained to just get up and start shooting before they know what is transpiring? I should really go back and time that scene.... 20 minutes of boring dialog followed by a 3 second shoot-out.And this movie is rated in the top 250? There are some really great scenes, like Brad breaking the Nazi solder out of prison. Some really funny stuff at times, but man - this is one poorly written movie."
"QT needs to go back to Directing School - indeed, if he ever went there in the first place. To describe this as 'art' is ludicrous; ever listen to 'The Emperor's New Clothes'?As an example - the table talk scene - how is it that the dog only barks when the people aren't speaking?Also getting a little tired of the world being saved by the American 5th Cavalry - what were we - oh that's right - THE ALLIES!Got a can of Gloss - going to paint a wall and watch it dry - marginally more interestingGet a life"
"8.5 points rating (26.11.2009)? For what are these points? What do people like on this sh**? Usually Tarantino makes not too bad movies with ridiculous violence scenes - but now? The whole movie looks like a dumb army propaganda video.Every normal human should see, that the actions of the ""heroes"" are in no way better then those of the ""enemies"". Killing unarmed kneeing people with baseball bat's is tough? The Nazi sign on the head is nothing else as the Yellow star (even worse cause its not removable). The story is simple, also the characters - only a little thrill and the rest is very very dumb. Nazis killing is fun,Nazis are no humans - before 60 years it was the same, only with Jews instead of Nazis. Looks like you've learned exactly NOTHING! So who are the real Nazis in this movie? So many people like this crap, i'm really afraid!"
"It's one of those movies that's difficult to evaluate because it's as inconsistent as it is. The plot is ludicrous yet there are very suspenseful moments embedded in it. Nobody could have made this except Quentin Tarantino -- it's that original -- and yet it rips off bits of business and entire subplots from a dozen or more other sources.Any enthusiasm I felt for it is limited because some scenes -- the entirety of ""Chapter One"" -- approach a kind of pornography of torture that's in danger of becoming a genre unto itself, and Tarantino, the writer and director, seems to get too much of a kick out what is some pretty ugly stuff.Brad Pitt is an American officer with an atrocious mountain accent who recruits a half dozen men to be inserted into France with the object of killing Nazis. The men are Jewish. The reasoning goes: the Nazis kill Jews, therefore we will kill Nazis. The collateral killing of any innocents is beside the point. The innocent must be punished along with the guilty. See ""The Dirty Dozen"" is you want a classier presentation of this moral nihilism.Not only do Pitt and his men kill the Nazis they capture. They scalp them too, and Tarantino treats the audience several times to explicit scenes of the men slicing the scalps of hair from the skulls of the dead.One captured officer is told to indicate where his unit is and how well armed and refuses, saying he will not yield information that will endanger the lives of German soldiers. There's a scene in ""Reservoir Dogs,"" in which Michael Madsen is left alone with an innocent policeman and caresses his razor as he describes the pleasure he's going to get from torturing the prisoner. In ""Reservoir Dogs,"" Madsen is the sadistic madman and the cop is the terrified captive who winds up being mutilated. In ""Inglorious Bastards,"" the German officer who refuses to give up the information is told he will have his brains beaten out by a Jew wielding a baseball bat -- ""The Bear Jew."" The scene is long and drawn out. The camera cuts between the blackness of the cave from with The Bear Jew will emerge -- we hear the bat banging against the wall and coming close -- and close ups of the horrified face of the officer awaiting his own death. The horror is justified. The point is that the sadistic lunatic of ""Reservoir Dogs"" has become the hero now.Well -- what's the point of this scene? Just killing the recalcitrant officer is a violation of the Geneva Conventions. But why draw the scene out with such relish? What does Tarantino expect from the viewer? Chills, thrills -- exaltation -- during the anticipation of the grisly murder? LAUGHTER? That's the kind of crap I'd expect in a cheap slasher movie before the pretty girl in the underwear gets her throat cut and blood splashes all over the walls.""Pulp Fiction"" was a true original, even if it was a couple of sub-plots slapped together. ""Reservoir Dogs"" had some fine acting, though it ended pointlessly. Both were essentially well-done in their own shocking ways.But I can't forgive Tarantino for this one. I don't mind the in-jokes. (The name of Pitt's officer is ""Aldo Raine."") There is even some intentional comedy that works. Pitt is trying to pass himself off as a native Italian, and you ought to hear him mangle the word ""arrivederci."" But not even the scenes that embody suspense, the genuinely well-staged episode in the basement night club, can lift this effort out of the teen-aged trash can.Good performances for the most part, especially from Melanie Laurent who is unmistakably French, Christoph Waltz as the chief Nazi villain, and Daniel Bruhl as the fresh-faced young German hero who is given some inexplicable and uncharacteristically villainous lines just before he's done in.The climax is a fantasy, which is okay, but there are signs of outright carelessness in the direction. (I don't want to call it stupidity.) The audience of high-ranking Nazis is sitting there watching a movie about a heroic sniper and everyone -- der Fuhrer included -- is laughing out loud as hundreds of American soldiers are shot and killed in a strictly Hollywood manner, twirling around, stunt men tumbling down stairs, anachronistic squibs exploding. Does anyone actually believe that an audience of sophisticates would laugh during a movie like this? Or -- let me put it differently. We made the same kind of movie, ""To Hell And Back,"" in which Audie Murphy played his historically heroic self and slaughtered hundreds of Germans. Did anyone laugh? Tarantino unquestionably has a lot of movie-making skill. Maybe it's time for him to reconsider the parameters of his morality."
"I have been feeling a little disappointed by Tarantino ever since death proof. But i insist it was only a little, because i can appreciate the amount of work in producing such an homage to stunts people. Inglorious Basterds has definitely propelled Tarantino to the top ranks in my universe. This movie can be summed up (albeit inadequately) in one word : ""RAW"". There is an intense emotion in every scene. Revenge and justice seem to be the main themes, From the start of the movie one feels compassion towards the victims of the Nazis, and is placed in Tarantino's fictional dimension of the WW2 historical context. Characters are unpredictiable, fun, scary, brutal, sexy, and other adjectives i am sure are escaping my mind that are just as fitting and positive. I won't go in to an appreciation of each character, but the other comments by fellow users sum up the appreciation of the various performances. Dialogue has evolved from the classic Tarantino ""bad ass"" provocative style as seen in Pulp Fiction and Death Proof. One can feel in the dialogues that Tarantino is making more open references to other movies. Indeed, many dialogues were near lessons in cinema to the audience, the setting partly takes place at a movie premiere ; a reference to a movie is close around every corner. It is nice to see that each language presented (German, French, and English) is employed rather equally and naturally. I speak both French and English very fluently, and am frequently disappointed in how English speaking characters in french movies act poorly, and how french speaking characters in English/American movies act poorly. Amazingly enough, Tarantino managed to make his actors pull off a natural and graceful performance from his actors. It helps put the audience in context of the historical context. Indeed ; soldiers, spies and civilans rarely understood soldiers/spies/civilians from other countries.The visuals/photography are beautiful, with sceneries convincingly conveying a 1940s WWII Europe. The outfits are perfect, and the violence orgasmically/realistically conveyed. No punches are held back, and the Nazis are often shown being tortured. This makes the movie not open to all audiences ; the graphic violence can shock the more sensitive demographic. volumes can be written about this movie. But the movie is so good, that during the North American Inglorious Basterds premiere at the Fantasia Festival in Montreal, i had to pee, but refused to go so as to not miss one single scene. I hope that image conveys how strongly i feel about this movie, and i'm a hard audience to please."
"This movie is nothing but a ""What If"" movie and not a good one at that. Spoilers throughout! What if we let soldiers run loose as a blood thirsty mob hacking away and beating the enemy to a pulp with a baseball bat, scalping them, mutilating them with no regard to the Geneva Conventions in regard to treatment of prisoners. What if the Germans were complete idiots when it came to security. Let's get real folks, do you believe that three Americans posing as Italians but not being able to speak Italian would have been let within 100 miles of Adolf Hitler. The whole idea of Adolf Hitler attending a movie in occupied France is pretty far fetched in itself, let alone throw in all the security blunders such as not having guards posted at all entrance and exit points, the roof, basement and inside the theater itself. That Hitler would have been seated with the rest and not had a private viewing spot that was also heavily guarded. That there would not have been any K9's to sniff out bombs. Then the final insult, what if Hitler had been killed, no mutilated with a slurry of machine gun fire along with the rest of his elite officers. So much for history, we are now in fantasy land. ""The Wizard of Oz"" is a complete fantasy but at least there was plot that made it a great movie. I might as well have been watching my nephew play one of his war video games. Big Spoiler Here! The movie was suppose to be about a group of men who took on the German army but there were only a few scenes of them. Those scenes were bloody and brutal and if anything left you feeling sorry for the Germans. Somehow this group blundered in on a secret mission that would get rid of the entire German leadership. The whole spy thing goes bad when an SS officer detects the English accent of the spy posing as a German officer, duh. To make matters worse three of the Basterds then take the spot of the spys that were killed and we are suppose to believe that these three Americans who spoke only a few words of Italian passed without incident to sit only a few rows away from Hitler himself. Then with only the barest of security our Basterds are able to plow down the entire German military leadership along with Hitler himself. Really, I've told better tales than this. I was really hoping for something more intelligent than this. I'm trying to figure out how this movie rated so well, did we watch the same movie or has the audience just forgotten what a good movie is?"
"First of all some general phrases about 'Inglourious Basterds' that every fan of this movie says: great plot, great actors and unforgettable performances (yes, especially by Christoph Waltz), great cinematography and great soundtrack Is that really it? No, there's definitely more to 'Inglourious Basterds' then what was mentioned above, there is something that makes this movie special. If one would want to summarise the whole story depicted in 'Basterds' with one phrase then it would probably be this one: 'Things are not as they appear to be, nor are they otherwise.' But it happens to be that I have a little more to say than one phrase. And soThe great moral of this movie or the great lesson that it gives us is this: our world is not just black and white, it's not the mixture of only good and bad, both 'good' and 'bad' things can be found in everyone and everything, and who is a hero and who is a villain depends totally on your perspective. Don't get me wrong, I am not talking about Hitler; but let's for example take Perrier LaPadite, how should we feel towards him? Is he a hero or a villain? He knows that if he doesn't collaborate with the Germans he and his family will be arrested and/or killed, but the Jewish family will die any way, whether he collaborates or not. And now let's look at a German Sgt. Werner Rachtman who finds himself in a similar position, and yet he shows unbelievable courage in the face of inevitable death. So should we despise him just because he's a German soldier and admire the clownish psychopath Donny Donowitz just because he's a Jew? Hardly. At least in my modest opinion. And then there are Hans Landa and Aldo Raine. I suppose that when trying to understand Landa or to express our feelings towards him we (the audience) should be very careful and we should also keep in mind that there is a very clear line between the actor and the character. Christoph Waltz was absolutely brilliant, but I guess his brilliant performance 'tricks' the audience into liking Col. Landa but if you take a second look at him you realize that no matter what intelligence and sophisticated manners (although Bridget von Hammersmark would disagree) he possesses there is not much left to like about him. As to Brad Pitt's Lt. Raine, we must like him because he's an American soldier fighting for a great cause, and so we forgive him for lacking both charm and manners and and then we take a closer look at him too. And what we find is that there is not much to like about him either, because in reality Raine is much more similar to Landa then it might appear at a first glance. Take the interrogation scenes for example: both are quite similar (Hans Landa interrogating the French farmer/ Aldo Raine interrogating the German sergeant), the behaviour of both Landa and Raine is actually identical: the things they demand – point where the Jews are hiding = point (on the map) where the German positions are; the things they offer – give me information and we'll leave your family alone = give me information and will let you go; the way they behave – actually both Landa and Raine behave rather friendly only Landa seams to be more glamorous and sophisticated; the way they both deceive their victim/captive – they both start a seemingly innocent conversation (rats and hawks and squirrels = what are you going to do after the war) and than –bang! – either kill the hiding Jews or carve a swastika on a soldier's forehead. As to the movie's title I've read in some other comments that it's inappropriate because 'the Basterds are given so little time in the movie', well, to my mind it depends on who are you calling a 'basterd'; it seams to me that none of the characters is innocent, everyone is a basterd: the French farmer who (although under the great pressure) betrays the Jewish family, the German actress who betrays her country (yes, betrays, for as Landa points out she only spied for the British for money), Shoshanna who threatens to bury an axe in a man's head and kill his wife and children, a somewhat shy and innocent-looking German sniper and yes , of course , Col. Landa, Lt. Raine and the (original) Basterds, Gestapo major and all the rest of German soldiers, Goebbels and Francesca Mondino, Hitler, but 'that goes without saying' and those people in the audience who jeer while the 'bad guys' are being scalped... I would also like to say a couple of words about the so-called historical inaccuracy. Well, first of all, this is not a historic movie and it does not pretend to be one. The thing is, when we see a movie/read a book like 'The three musketeers' or something similar with a lot of (intended) historical inaccuracies we have no problem with that because, obviously, it all happened a long time a go, so who cares? The problem with the 'Basterds' is that the story is set against the background of WW 2 and this is still a rather sensitive topic – you can do whatever you like with the French kings but you cannot touch Hitler. I personally find this rather odd.Now to draw up the conclusion I'll have to repeat something I've already said before: we are too accustomed to take things shown in the movie idealistically, meaning we always tend to classify, to label facts, people, ideas, etc. as either good or bad, right or wrong and we keep forgetting that there's always the other side of the coin, the other perspective"
"My brother recommended this movie for me don't know why. It could of gone a good movie but its a major failed. It doesn't show them fighting Germans at all or doing guerrilla or apache tactics. I expected it to be suspenseful and action but sadly no.I agree with the other comments about this movie it's really lame. Interesting dialogue from the jew hunter but fail in character plot and the German troops. What happen to the other inglorious basterds their gone missing and why is there only two guards protecting Hitler, I expected a climax at the end. I don't see a lot of German troops at all only about 5 in the bar and only 2 at the cinema what the?Here's a good movie have lots of German personnel and tanks, more action more suspense and make them cunning, well trained and battle hardened. Have french resistance, SAS commandos and the inglorious basterds. Put them all together you could of made a hell of movie just like Wolfenstein or Hidden and Dangerous. It was a good idea but failed to be put into action because of you Quintin Tarantino"
"This must be Tarantino's worst movie. Not only is the storyline utterly absurd and implausible, but the characters are straight out of a comic book for 10-14 year old boys. I cannot understand why this loathsome piece of cinematic garbage gets such good reviews from people who really should know better. What is so great about a bunch of American Jews, hellbent on violent revenge, who go into occupied France to kill (murder) as many Germans as possible? And the idea that the entire Nazi leadership, including Hitler, would gather to a cinema in Paris to watch the premiere of a new Nazi movie, is so stupid and implausible that it's not even funny. At least Tarantino's previous films, though as insanely violent as this one, did have good story lines and were credible. This one is straight from the mind of an inmate of some lunatic asylum. Fans of Tarantino will praise everything he does, but this creation is well below his best. The only positive thing about the movie is the superb performance of Christoph Waltz."
"Tarantino is so full of himself, but the only achievement I can acknowledge is that he has reached unconditional praise and success for movies that are vastly overrated, severely violent, so incoherent that they should be changed to fantasy genre because of their lack of realism.Inglorious Bastards is basically Ocean's Eleven remake with violence and 100% ego displayed. There's no story, it's not funny, nobody is even trying to act.I don't have a problem with directing a comedy about WWII - after all, the Grande Vadrouille is a sensational and hysterical movie, that manages to ignore completely the gravity of the war and the occupation. Why ? Precisely because it is a real comedy. All the fundamental laws for directing a movie are missing, it's alarming."
"Stupid me, I didn't even notice who the director was before I sat down to watch this really peculiar film.With the possible exception of the first segment, the film - despite what the storyline is saying - is entirely in the here and now. A fantasy of revenge played out amid - not just gratuitous - but completely surreal, graphic, sickening violence. The carnage is so over-the-top that it quickly doesn't even garner a raised eyebrow, it becomes simply wallpaper behind a really vapid, simple fairytale. And the sets and costumes, though I guess not entirely inappropriate for WWII, never feel like anything more than just what they are - sets and costumes. The ambiance being much more akin to gangsta rap than Glen Miller. ""Forties"" it definitely is NOT.Though I initially was interested in the story, it devolved quickly into a nonsensical race to the bottom in trying to outdo itself for sheer in-your-face, amoral brutality. Is this Tarrantino thinks passes for entertainment? God, I can't imagine what a twisted, jaded, socio-pathological mind can produce such disgusting, visually repellent images.And then for a finale, QT decides to completely rewrite history, and two members of a ragtag troop of misfits - with the help of a theatre owner and her projectionist - defeat the entire German high command. No armies required, TYVM. What a joke.In the end I found myself somewhat ashamed for having sat and watched this. It says far more about who we are today in 2010 America, than it ever would about WWII. And what it says is something less than complimentary."
"Tasteless and pathetic ... it's unbelievable how could Mr.Waltz do such a nice professional job in such an ugly, tasteless setting. Rhetoric question - how could the German actors collaborate in such a project where the bloody, painful, terrible real German history is made into a shitty-burlesque black comedy (from the perspective of an uneducated 7th-grader who just started to learn something about world history, but could not yet find the right language to speak about it except the language of a comics strip). Is it than at least entertaining? Not at all ... boring and annoying. Or should these quasi-Jewish bastards be funny? What a pity! What an insult to the real Jewish fighters against the Nazis! My condolences to Tarantino - the movie is an incredible proof of artistic and ethic impotence."
"*may contain spoilers* I probably was expecting better from Tarantino because I have to say this is his worst. I prefer Jackie Brown and Pulp Fiction to this rubbish. Brad Pitt stuck out like a sore thumb, only bigger-his character is a real jerk and as far as I'm concerned is absolutely useless to the story. This is trying too hard to be funny. I liked certain characters (Fassbender's Lt. and Kruger's actress) far more than I enjoyed the story. In fact, what WAS the story? The film editing was so choppy. Quite frankly after the scene in the bar with Fassbender and Kruger, the whole film just goes downhill from there. I'm a fan of war films and films that portray the German side, but this certainly cannot be taked seriously with others. This movie got so much undeserved hype."
"At first... this film is too long for presented story. How would Elvis say? oh yeah...''A little less conversation, a little more action please''. With this story film should take at least 30min less. What about highlights and message? Oh... little Jewish girl Shosanna take revenge for killing her family? Please! An Brad Pitt... he does not fall in this movie at all and his redneck accent... Please one more time! And what is the biggest irony? In inglorious bastards is so much talking and blaming German propaganda... and what is all this jumbo posters and commercials for this film? Its nothing else that American propaganda. And lets see statistic... Inglorious bastards has 8,6 points in average, release was one month ago and film has 71000 votes. And you tell me these votes are realistic and independent from flood of commercials. I'm not saying this film is poor, but it is absolutely overrated. This is an average film for my taste and I think 6 points is enough. I would suggest you film Zwartboek (2006) if you like historical dramas ( Pay attention on number of votes )."
"Utterly frustrating viewing experience. There is an excellent film in here but it's ruined by the way in which Tarantino breaks the contract with the viewer. There is absolutely no need to vandalise the viewing experience by insulting the intelligence of the viewer and by scribbling (literally) over the images on screen in a way that further implies the viewer is an idiot who could not follow a simple story without the guidance from an unseen hand.The obvious thing to do to improve this film by 100% is to get rid of the Inglorious Basterds. They are completely irrelevant to the action and the storyline. You need an American covert presence in Europe to carry the story but the basterds team in no way fulfils this requirement, rather it detracts. For one thing the whole scalping and torturing your enemy storyline makes the basterds no better than the Nazis; for another the Brad Pitt character is an embarrassment from start to finish. I do not blame Pitt for this as he is clearly playing the part as the cartoon character that was defined by the script.I'm not averse to doing things differently and I think the unexplained change to the real historical timeline and the use of contemporary music works well. The first ""chapter"" is a master class in creating tension as is the sequence in the cellar. As others have commented the acting of Christoph Waltz is astonishing and quite the best thing in the film. But there are other beautiful sequences such as the opening of chapter five with its superb framing and use of the colour red. Such a pity that the rest of the film is so poorly done.Whilst I know that few will agree with me, the director Tarantino most reminds me of is Stanley Kubrick. Like Kubrick he can produce scenes of breath-taking originality but he is unable to sustain the vision over an entire film. If Tarantino could shed his sometimes infantile interjections into his own film-making process he could produce a work of true genius. Inglorious basterds is half genius, half embarrassing nonsense."
"The Americans, as usual, are the Good Guys and the Germans the Bad Guys. But in this movie the yanks win by being more treacherous and brutal than their adversaries. They are supposedly of Jewish origin, which makes them Good Guys, but that's a flimsy excuse for sadistic violence. And the setting and plot has only a remote resemblance to whatever could have happened in France in 1944. You can of course make a fantasy movie about Merlin or about Caribbean pirates just for entertainment and nobody cares about historical accuracy. WWII is now just background scenery for those who enjoy senseless violence. I found the movie disgusting and, ever worse, boring."
"I will make it short: Tarantino is a very sick individual, no doubt. He has no sense for timing, he steals of other ( better) directors like it would be virtuous, and he absolutely knows nothing about WWII. Brad Pitt, who is one of my favourite actors, simply stank. His accent was awful and he overacted like an amateur. The scene where his bluff of being an Italian should have been called, but for some weird reason is not, is absolutely laughable, but nevertheless not funny.We were a bunch of guys watching that movie and none, seriously none liked it. I firmly believe that Tarantino is in love with himself and that shows what bad taste he has."
"Sitting in the cinema, I was absolutely furious with myself for paying money to see this trash. The violence was gratuitous, every scene and character was clichéd, QT was just trying way too hard. It was hard to shake the feeling that this film was adapted from a short story written by a 14 year old boy trying to shock his parents, and make his friends think that he is cool. The strudel scene made me ill. Here's the overdone cliché: let's make the bad guy eat food and talk with his mouth full. How many times have we seen this in a film? This film was yawn from one end to the other. When I wasn't rolling my eyes at the ridiculous scenes of violence, I was yawning at the drawn out conversations, and the obvious efforts that went into 'building tension.' I cannot believe that so many people have raved on about how great this film is, when it is one of the worst films ever made. I guarantee that all the people who claim to love it won't bother to watch it again on DVD."
"Some incredible performances in this movie, especially Christoph Waltz as Colonel Landa. The actors carry the movie. But I found the story pretty weak and not very engaging, overly long and rather dragging at times, and the whole tone to be weirdly and offensively dissonant with its subject material. I think the film is founded on rather shallow ideas, which are conveyed with typical Tarantino slickness, but in a crass way. Different elements of the movie lack cohesion - very jarringly at times - and the overall tone is rather soulless, despite some stellar character performances which (only just) make it worthwhile to watch."
"The answer: Having to READ about 2 hours of it! Yes, the man is talented. And yes, there are parts of this overly-lengthy film that are terrific, but I've just come to the point where the thrill is gone. Gone is my appetite for Tarantino's style with excessive homages to an era of films I never saw, and neither did many of his hard-core fans. Gone (if it ever was truly there) is my desire for endless conversations that seldom lead anywhere or advance what little plot his films often have. It's all pretty much gone. Tarantino has been doing this to us for almost twenty years now, and its time that either himself or myself moves on.Inglourious Basterds is marketed to the masses as somewhat of a revenge film about Jewish commandos slaughtering Nazi troops behind enemy lines with Brad Pitt as their leader. Some of this lengthy film will in fact actually deal with that story line. But so much more of it is window dressing with long, subtitled conversations in either French or German. Many of our characters are not believable... even in a Tarantino universe. Nothing we see is plausible. And very little of it is tense. Many have pointed to Christoph Waltz's portrayal of a kind of SS detective as being the lone good aspect of this film. That's pretty much the case. This guy grabs the film and runs away with it. Pitt is tolerable for once, but his character doesn't have to do much in terms of acting range. Thank Goodness. Diane Kruger has some nice moments, and its good to see her in something other than National Treasure movies. I guess... watch if you must, but this is not the director's best work. His breed of film peaked with the Kill Bill movies, and it isn't clear if he is capable of doing anything that isn't just a patchwork of what others have done. Inglourious Basterds is a long, talky waste of 153 minutes. Its few good scenes aren't enough to justify the rest. 5 of 10 stars.The Hound."
"Seeing this film with an 8.5 rating beggars belief. Tarantino's finest moment was undoubtedly Pulp Fiction. Clever story, interesting characters, roller coaster ride and a well thought out, interwoven plot. This film is quite the opposite. Almost lazy. Weak and insulting script, AWFUL acting from Brad Pitt (embarrassingly bad given how much he's manage to shine in other, more challenging roles (i.e. Snatch), and predictable throughout. So, Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and downhill ever since. Where's the spark gone? Or perhaps QT's just lost it for good. Pity.It seems many people these days are just happy to hail any old tripe he roles out as 'original and daring', when in reality it's quite the opposite - shallow and intellectually insulting. There were a couple of moments when the dialogue started to show some of the old sparkle, but generally (apart from the main German officer) performances were weak or, worse, comical. Each film he brings out I hope for a return to form, but what once was concentrate now just seems to be over-diluted tripe."
