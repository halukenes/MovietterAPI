"Die Hard (1988) the first action film is by far one of the greatest best action movies of all time from the 80's till this day hands down. It is my number 1 personal favorite action movie of all time, I love this movie to death! I love it so damn much and I have fun watching it so much. I have to talk about this movie: It is one man army fighting against a team of terrorists with automatic weapons and plastic explosives. Bruce Willis performance was excellent in this movie John McClane is his best role ever. It is my number 1 personal favorite action movie of all time, I love this movie to death! It's stay in my heart forever. To me it felt this film realistic and it makes you think that you are alone trapped in a building against bunch of terrorists what will you do? This film has heart and soul. A lot of movies have try to do that premise since, but no movie has nail it like ""Die Hard."" This is a modern day action film of the action genre. I watch this film as a teenager I even watch it with my mom it was ultimate thrill ride. I love everyone in here all the characters and the lead character. I love that McClane is alone he has no help, all telephones doesn't work he is barefoot with his gun and the only help has is from Sgt. Al Powell down there who didn't even see him at all but were both talking on a radio from cop to cop. I love that bond between those two lead heroes. I always love when McClane talks to himself whenever he was about to do something crazy. It is going to be 30 years anniversary this summer 20th July. I love this film to death I am hugh fan of Die Hard films I love this film so damn much. I would really love to see this movie in a widescreen in a movie theater. It was directed by brilliant John McTiernan it is is based on a novel Roderick Thorp Nothing Lasts Forever. This is a masterpiece action film that started all action genre one man army types battling terrorists while trapped in a confined space. It was arguably the first one in the action genre. This movie has everything . It has intense Action, Drama, Thriller, twists, great dialogue, explosions, fights. Exploding building, great helicopter explosion action scenes. John McClane is one man against a whole team of terrorists. A cracking Action Thriller from beginning to end, Die Hard explodes with heart-stopping suspense! It has great cast, great plot, great explosions, no shaky cam, doesn't deal with CGI, but real actions real practical effects. Great Direction from John McTiernan, great dialogues, great acting from everyone. Everyone does an excellent job. Bruce Willis is a bad ass action star as John McClane. It has a great bad-ass action hero who does impossible buy stopping the terrorists who were actually a real terrorists who try to steal the money in a vault 640.000.000$ in bearer bonds stored in the building's vault. My favorite action sequences and the best part of Die Hard: McClane grabs the fire hose, ties it around his body jumps with the helicopter about to kill him. Then Gruber blows it a second after McLane jumps off the roof! It was an incredible explosion that totally takes out the helicopter. But McLane is falling down the side of the building and needs to get inside quickly this is the best scene in the movie my favorite. McClane climbs in the elevator shaft escapes Karl and his men trying to kill him. McClane shoots on the table with his gun killing Marco. (According to the director, the proximity of the gun to Willis' ear during this scene caused permanent hearing loss for Willis.) 
McClane shot's Hans and Eddie ""Happy - Trails, Hans..."" Incredibly satisfying action in a brilliant action movie! McClane try to save Ellis when Ellis try to save him self. McClane was afraid of flying and he always carry gun because he was afraid someone would have hijack it. The fight between Karl and John was excellent and well choreographed. McClane drops C4 down the elevator shaft and destroys the entire floor where the terrorists are firing from, giving the cops a chance to retreat. I love The broken glass scene. He shoot's and kills two terrorists with his machine gun to escape Hans and Karl, John McClane is forced to sprint over broken glass while barefoot the best bad-ass scene in the movie my all time favorite. Three terrorists are shooting on McClane on the roof chasing him in which he escapes in the beginning of the movie awesome. Karl shoots in an elevator shaft in which McClane is hiding a real kick-ass scene I love this film to death! I love the characters in this movie: John McClane a real action hero to me that does something that no one can he stops a team of terrorists. Hans Grubar the German mastermind he was ruthless and brilliant and he would do anything to steal the money even killing people and get what he want's. Alan Rickman's performance was excellent I love him to death in this movie. I really miss the actor he was the best villain of the whole world. The LAPD Supervisor (Diana James) I like that girl she was so good when McClane call's her for help, I love it. I love Sgt. Al Powell how he stand's up and defends McClane against his supervisor. Reginald VelJohnson does a brilliant performance as a great supporting hero in this movie. I love Deputy Police Chief Dwayne T. Robinson to death he is my favorite character in here. Paul Gleason was so good I love his performance - ""kick ass."" I love how he tried everything to safe the hostages including SWAT team who were badly hurt. I like Richard Thornburg in this movie who is annoying reporter but I still like it. Bonnie Bedelia as Holly McClane's wife was great.John McTiernan directed excellent this masterpiece Jeb Stuart and Steven E. de Souza wrote a script that it delivers. The helicopters in here were models in this movie delivered, to me the action scenes felt realistic. This movie has ton's of action and you never get bored with it. Michael Kamen made a music score and you never get bored with it. You'll see lots of heavy automatic and explosive weapons, and you'll see them used well. The film is violent, and bloody rated R with real blood squibs. 10/10 it is my favorite action film in the action genre I love this film to death it is my personal action favorite film. I miss movies like this I miss action movies like this one today I want them back. It is a shame we don't have movies like this today."
"""Die Hard"" is the prototype type for the modern action film.  Since it's also one of the best action films ever made, that happens to be a very good thing.  ""Die Hard"" is lean, mean, and doesn't contain a single second of wasted screen time. The direction, the action, the story, the acting . . . every aspect of this film comes close to big-budget action movie perfection. Since ""Die Hard"" was first released in 1988, it's difficult to think of a blockbuster action film that doesn't follow the basic structure and format of ""Die Hard"" . . . or, for that matter, is better than ""Die Hard"".
""Die Hard"" is about John McClane (Bruce Willis, in one of his all-time best film performances), a basically good, honest New York cop with a penchant for annoying authority figures.   Traveling to Los Angeles in a last ditch attempt to patch things up with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), John McClane suddenly finds himself involved in a hostage situation. Terrorists, led by the enigmatic Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), have taken over the office building in which Holly is working, and with Gruber holding the upper hand over the LAPD and FBI forces in Los Angeles, it's up to John McClane to save the day . . . .Kudos should be given to both director John McTiernan and screenwriters Jeb Stuart and Steven DeSouza -- the film is tight, electrifying, and clever, which is something few action films can ever claim.  The story isn't completely believable, but it's believable enough, and it manages to move along at a quick enough pace to where the most glaring plotholes can easily be glossed over.  There's also enough twists and wrinkles thrown into the story to keep the audience guessing as to what's going to happen next . . . and the surprises don't come out of left field, but are actually clever and well thought-out.  (The fact that McClane often relies on his brains instead of his bullets to get out of his predicaments is also a big plus.) Simply put, ""Die Hard"" is one of the smartest and savviest action screenplays ever written.  McTiernan holds up his end of the film admirably as well -- he uses the claustrophobic nature of the office building to great effect (particularly in any scene involving an elevator shaft), and he keeps the film rolling at a rollercoaster pace, building up the anticipation of the audience before unleashing the action.  A lot of recent action films just fly along at a mindless, breakneck pace, without ever allowing the story to breathe or the suspense to build . . . unlike those films, ""Die Hard"" knows how to maximize the impact of each and every scene, and that's why it stands out so clearly from them all.  With ""Die Hard"", John McTiernan puts on a perfect clinic as to how to pace an action movie.As for the acting, it's darn near close to perfect.  Bruce Willis is awesome as John McClane.  As played by Willis, McClane's a smartass with a distinct disdain for being given orders . . . but McClane's also clever, and knows how to keep cool under pressure.  There's more to McClane than the stereotypical tough guy hero.  Fortunately, the role was given to Bruce Willis, who infuses McClane with the perfect mix of cocky arrogance and stone-cold heroism.  The fact that Willis plays McClane as a man often in disbelief of his own situation, and who struggles in his fight against bad guys instead of just killing bad guys with ease, like most stereotypical action heroes -- well, not only does it make the character much more believable, it's darn brilliant.  (The fact that Willis also knows how to deliver a deadpan one-liner better than anybody else in Hollywood makes the character all the better.)  There's only a handful of movies where both character and actor are a completely perfect match; Bruce Willis as John McClane is one such perfect match.Also worthy of mention is Alan Rickman's performance as the villain Hans Gruber.  The Machiavellian Gruber would've been an easy villain to turn into little more than a scenery-chewing Bond villain . . . fortunately, Rickman doesn't travel the easy route.  Gruber, as played by Rickman, is cold and calculating, and actually acts smart, instead of merely claiming to be smart and then being thoroughly outwitted by the hero.  He always appears to have an ace hidden up his sleeve, and is so convincing at giving this impression, it's hard to tell throughout the film whether he or McClane truly have the upper hand.  Other actors probably could've played Gruber fairly well, but Rickman makes Gruber one of the all-time great villains.  As for the rest of the cast, they're all pretty good.  Bonnie Bedelia does a nice job as John's soon-to-be-ex-wife Holly -- she plays her with enough smarts and feistiness to break the usual ""damsel in distress"" mold.  It's also worth mentioning that Paul Gleason, who plays the obstinate police chief Robinson, pretty much sets up the modern action movie stereotype of the authority figure who refuses to heed the advice of the maverick hero.  The character is stupid to a fault, and he's wonderful because of it.""Die Hard"" is a terrific example of what happens when all the pieces of a film fall together perfectly.  There simply are no weak spots or dull moments in the film.  Is ""Die Hard"" one of the best overall movies ever made?  Probably not.  But it's undeniably one of the best action movies ever made, and it just might well be the perfect modern action film.  Grade: A"
"One could claim that 1988's ""Die Hard"" is one of the most influential action movies ever made because it basically revolutionized one of the most copied (but never matched, at least in terms of quality) formulas: a loner, by some unique twist of fate, battles it out with an ""x"" number of terrorists in an enclosed environment.By the time that ""Die Hard"" was released, the action movies were most often dominated by the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, and Chuck Norris. Star Bruce Willis, whose only notable credits at the time were television's ""Moonlighting"" and 1987's ""Blind Date,"" which was released the year before, was the unlikeliest of them all.Willis was a wild card - an unlikely choice for the role of our hero ""John McClane"" - since he didn't have any action credits on his resume' and let's face it: Bruce Willis just didn't have the bulging biceps required for a role like this. But that's the beauty of his performance in this movie: he's an everyday guy, caught in a not-so-everyday situation.On Christmas, McClane's estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) invites him from New York all the way out to Los Angeles to spend the holidays with the family. But it requires him to make a stop at the Nakatomi offices, which is having an after-hours Christmas party. Riding for the first time in a limo, he's introduced to the suave driver, Argyle (De'voreaux White), who gives him some pretty useful advice on trying to win over the wife.At Nakatomi, things of course get off to a rough start for McClane, as he gets into an argument with the wife and is left to wallow in his misery. However, those problems are about to take a backseat to the real ""party"" - twelve terrorists, led by Hans Gruber (all-purpose bad guy Alan Rickman, perfectly cast) - seize control of the building and proceed to rob the Nakatomi building of its assets, most of which include negotiable bonds and other valuables. But they didn't count on the ""fly in the ointment"" (pain in the a**) to make things hell for these so-called party crashers.Certainly one of the best known action movies ever, ""Die Hard"" did receive the scorn of critics upon its 1988 summer release, but the audiences sung a completely different tune.The film was most often praised for the production, with the brand-new Fox Plaza office tower serving as the fictional Nakatomi building. It was also praised for the energetic and skillful direction of John McTiernan, whose most notable credit was the action-sci-fi thriller ""Predator,"" which was released the year before and starred Arnold Schwarzenegger.Bruce Willis was the perfect actor for this performance, since he brings the wit and vulnerability to a role like this one. If Stallone or Schwarzenegger were in this movie, I'm sure the effect would have been a lot different.Personally, I think ""Die Hard"" is one of the greatest action movies ever, up there close to my favorite action movie of all time, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Like Indiana Jones in that film, ""Die Hard"" had an Everyman cast in the role; McClane, like Indiana Jones, wasn't a larger-than-life musclebound grotesque: he was a real guy that you cared about, who got hurt, and had real feelings.That's why I think both of these movies have sort of stood the test of time as becoming what they are best known for today: action classics, and they're here to stay, ladies and gentlemen.10/10"
"Seeing 'Die Hard' for the first time as a teenager was a one-of-a-kind experience. This level of raw, ""edge-of-your-seat"" action was unknown to me prior to this film; it made my head spin and the intensity of it was nearly unbearable. When it was over, I could only think of one word: Wow!For a long time - at least in western cinema - the only ""true"" action movies (by that I mean films that were all about the action and you went to see them because of the action) were the 'James Bond' movies. They had the most unreal stunts and crazy, over the top action sequences that you could imagine at the time, and they were (and still are) great fun. However, they usually lacked three vital ingredients:1. A sense of realism (meaning: the hero is only human and can get hurt)2. Grit (messy, unpolished action, dirty people and LOTS of swearing)3. R-rated violence (showing the audience what real weapons do to the human body)Well, it took John McTiernan to bring those three key elements together in 'Die Hard' - and thus the modern action film was born (it had a good run through the late eighties until the end of the nineties – then the studios figured out they could maximise the box-office by taming down the swearing, violence and sex and thus, alas, the contemporary, toothless PG-13 action film was born). Sure, there have been a couple of others before McTiernan's masterpiece ('First Blood', 'Terminator', 'Predator' - which was also by McTiernan - or 'Lethal Weapon' and probably some more), but those films could have fallen into any number of other categories as well ('Adventure-/Survival-/War-', 'Sci- Fi', 'Horror-' or 'Buddy-movie') – and I can't think of another film that was just such a relentless, pure-action-from-the-beginning-to-the-end film as was 'Die Hard'. To me, it's the ultimate thrill ride. The formula has since been repeated so many times, but the original still sets the standard by which I judge an action film. Should be seen every Christmas. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
"Of course the Action Genre existed before Die Hard. After all you had The Terminator, Commando, Top Gun, Roadhouse...but didn't Die Hard absolutely revolutionize the eighties action Genre. It came like a savior and encompassed everything that would blow you right out the back of the theater and made Bruce Willis an absolute idol in the Action world and for good reason. Die Hard had pointless nudity, scores of bad language, bloody death, guns, explosions, a gritty, tough as nails, sweating, dirty hero that takes on everyone with nothing more than a hand gun and his brains. If you watch Willis in Die Hard it's a thing of beauty. His shirt torn off, bare foot, wounds all over him...he looks like he just crawled from a war rather than stalking terrorists through an enormous high rise office building in L.A. The script was so dead on...it was basic, it was to the point, it has great sarcastic humor and one liners that could never be forgotten. And Willis was the man to pull it all together. Add a decent supporting cast, a guy on the ground who is like his partner and a MacGyver style of killing bad guys that will go down in history...THIS IS DIE HARD.Bruce Willis was brought up right in the Prime of his TV Series Moonlighting where his irresistible charm and personality made him a hit. John McLean was David Addison but with a lot more guts and a lot more ammo. That only made the film more exciting to fans of Willis already. Willis has a way of just making everything edge of your seat and everything believable. Who else could make you smile in fear when he's diving out of a 30 story window attached to a fire hose while the roof of the building is exploding. He really doesn't single handedly make the film...the supporting cast is terrific. Bonnie Bedelia is great as McLean's straight laced, professional and estranged wife. They make an odd yet touching couple. They have some electricity and it's ironic and yet sensible that they don't end up together throughout the series. Still Bedelia is a great female lead and her character is strong and not at all misused in the role. Alan Rickman is just one kick ass bad guy. Can you say anything else?? As terrorist Hans Gruber he is terrifying, evil, brilliant, and you just despise him and you can't wait to see him go up against Willis and he does. He doesn't stand a chance but Rickman is still brilliant as the bad guy. Reginald VelJohnson plays a small yet very important role as Willis' guy on the ground on the other end of a walkie talkie. They don't know each other, and barely know each other's name but yet they become as close as partners and they too are odd together and yet fit. William Atherton has to be mentioned even though it's a very small role, it's Die Hard history that he plays slimy, tabloid reporter Richard Thornburg who gets his just end by Holly McLean's fist which becomes a running joke in the series.Die Hard is everything that people would look at in disgust now in the new millennium and yet it was everything the eighties stood for when it came to action and heroes. McLean has a cigarette dangling from his mouth, blood pouring everywhere, and a happy ending despite all the destruction around them. If you haven't seen Die Hard you can't ever proclaim yourself an action fan because Die Hard IS action. It's the film every action film strives to live to and will never meet...whether it was before 1988 or after. We won't ever get something like this again. It's an absolute 100% classic!! for all the wrong reasons!! 10/10"
"I was not a Bruce Willis fan per say. As a matter of fact, I thought what is this guy from Moonlighting gonna do? Is he gonna make them laugh to death with stupid comments and jokes? I was not a fan of ""Moonlighting"" then either, that would come later. In addition I was not thinking, 'John McClain' ""Hans Gruber' or 'John McTiernan' that was my first error.As I took in the very first minute of the film, I knew, this was going to be radically different than I had imagined. This movie and John McTiernan's directing (Also 'Preditor'-1987 'The Thomas Crown Affair'-1999) (The Hunt for red October) (Medicine Man)The way I felt from his genius directing style, that gets you fully involved, stomach wrapped in knots, pulse pounding. He brings out the whole story, not just a 'clot' of mindless action and or violence. He actually led up to the stories climax and didn't blow it when he got there. I was shocked at this movie, which gets 'compared to' all the time with other action and drama movies! Still, after two decades. Needless to say, it changed the way I felt about movies and film making. From Willis's flawless performance to master terrorist Hans Gruber, (Rickman) what a truly superb 'Villain' & (James Shigeta, Holly's Boss) the emotion and heart-thumping fear that lead up to the demise of James's character. The scenery of the towering building and the city itself after dark, under the threat of terrorist activity. Don't forget L.A. P.D.-in charge 'DeWayne T. Robinson', (Paul Gleason - God rest his soul -Died May 26, 2006)I truly looked at film with a whole different view point. I got a copy of the original script, well the 18th re-write or something like that and went, line by line, through the story. It was unbelievable how this movie changed my mind on Movies...as well as Bruce Willis. I just can't say enough about Die-hard, but I will come to a soft close...but before I do, here is a 'spanner' of a thought, originally Willis was not first choice, it was Stallone that they wanted and he turned it down, think on that one! This would not be what it is this way, it would be wholly different with 'Sly' at the helm. I will even venture further out, do you know who this was originally written for? -Answer: Burt Reynolds. No kidding.This is on my all-time list of the best of the best films, bar-none."
"Every Christmas, there are 2 movies that I have to watch: ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" and ""Die Hard"".Every guy that I talk to about this agrees that ""Die Hard"" is a classic Christmas movie. When I talk to women about this, I haven't met a single one that agrees. My wife certainly doesn't agree, but she watches it with me each year anyway.From the first scene where John is in Argyle's limo, the snow's falling and we hear a more hip-hop themed Christmas it just feels right. When John does get to his destination, it's a good-old-fashioned Christmas office party... everyone is in good spirits and sharing some cheer.Sure, there's lots of killing later in the movie, but that doesn't take away from the Christmas feeling that I always have when I watch this movie.If you celebrate Christmas and you haven't yet incorporated this movie into your Christmas ritual, do so this year."
"So many things made this movie great.This movie made Bruce Willis immortal. He soaks up this character so well, it was him. The wise cracking cop who is entertaining because he is sarcastically funny not uttering stupid catch phrases. He is a cop who looks like a normal guy, middle age, loosing some hair with wife problems. (no faked up pretty face with shaved chest and oiled muscles). He is cool without pretending to be cool. He manages to thwart the bad guys while barefoot, man that is a great twist.The plot is great because it does not fall perfectly in line for the hero. He stumbles, gets stuck and survives only by last minute thinking. It has plenty of action without getting ridiculous.And the bad guys are great, smart sinister and well acted.It is one of those movies that could play every weekend and would still be watched. Is one of those top 10 movies every guy should own.Die hard 2 was OK but not as good as the original, I wish they would have stopped after 2. Die Hard 3 is poor."
"Even if the non-action parts are a tad slow in comparison, that is more than compensated by so many things that makes Die Hard so brilliant.For one thing the action is explosive and consistently exciting, and the cinematography is astounding being very inventive and colourful. John McTiernon(The Hunt for Red October, Last Action Hero) directs briskly and efficiently, and the pacing a vast majority of the time is exhilarating.Then there is a terrific score by Michael Kamen, some intelligent and witty scripting and a plot that doesn't feel forced or convoluted. Not to mention some excellent acting. As good as Bruce Willis is, yes his character is somewhat two-dimensional, but he is also resourceful and world-weary and Willis handles this really well, it is Alan Rickman who steals the acting honours as Hans Gruber. Gruber is cold, calculating, suave and menacing, in my opinion only Rickman could do justice to such a character. Overall, a superb movie, not only the best of the Die Hard franchise but one of the best of the action genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"Every so often,a film comes along that resets the standard for it's genre.Die Hard did just that very thing for action films.Any film that inspires copycats and wannabes really does it's job well.Bruce Willis made a very successful transition from the small screen to the big screen as the everyday Joe forced into being the hero.This film has all the necessary ingredients to qualify it as a great action film.All you have to do is see it for yourself.Particularly well done is the performance of Alan Rickman as the chief villain,Hans Gruber.You can come up with good arguments for many action films as to which is the best all time,and this one is no exception.Well done."
"Quite possibly the best modern action movie since the classic ""Dirty Harry"", ""Die Hard"" simply rocks. Based on the interesting novel ""Nothing Lasts Forever"" by Roderick Thorp, ""Die Hard"" made headlines for its combination of a terrific cast, excellent script, amazing action sequences and superb direction.  Headed up by screen favorite Bruce Willis (The Sixth Sense), ""Die Hard"" also features the talented Alan Rickman (Galaxy Quest) and Bonnie Bedelia (Needful Things).  Directed by action veteran John McTiernan, the mastermind behind such action spectaculars as ""Predator"", ""The Hunt For Red October"", ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" (1999), and ""Die Hard With A Vengeance"".In the role that shot him to stardom, Willis plays Detective John McClane, a hard-hitting cop from New York on Christmas Vacation in LA.  He is there to visit his wife (whom he is separated from), Holly Gennaro, who recently got a great job working for the Nakatomi corporation and has permanently moved to Los Angeles with their two children.  John arrives at Nakatomi Plaza expecting a fun Christmas party and a relaxing night.  Man was he wrong!  A few minutes after getting settled, twelve gun-toting Eastern Europeans take the entire 30th floor hostage.  The supposed terrorists are headed up by the brilliant megalomaniac Hans Gruber (Rickman), who actually wants the $640 million dollars inside the floor's vault.  Somehow, McClane escapes upstairs armed only with a handgun and starts causing a ruckus, slowly hunting down each well-equipped thug.""Die Hard"" succeeds is because it presents every challenge McClane has to face realistically and clearly.  As the tension mounts, the ordeals for John become increasingly harder.  First, it's just a terrorist.  Then a whole slew of them.  Later, it's the NYPD and even the FBI!  Director McTiernan gives the film a good pace and makes the film work by showing that John isn't superhuman; he only uses his brain more than his gun.  Also, screenwriters Jeb Stuart (The Fugitive) & Steven E. De Souza (48 Hrs.) add touches of humor that lighten up the viewer and classic one-liners (""Yippy-Ki-Yay, !@#$"") that ignite the screen.  Their subplots actually add to the story instead of overcomplicating it, especially one featuring good cop Sgt. Al Powell (Rejinald VelJohnson of TV's ""Family Matters"").Overall, this movie was awesome.  Willis is very believable and has significant screen presence.  Character development is superb, and even though Stuart and De Souza leave some loose ends untied - like how  a man gets hung with a chain and still comes back for more - the film remains to be an action classic.  Note to Parents: the nudity, drug use, continual profanity, and extreme violence would make this a bad choice for kids under 13.  Otherwise, see ""Die Hard"" ASAP! Overall Rating:   *** Worth 9 out of 10 dollars ***"
"In the Sixties, author Roderick Thorp wrote a novel, The Detective, which was turned into a movie, starring Frank Sinatra in the title role of Joe Leland. A sequel was written, in which Joe becomes trapped in the Claxxon Oil Corporation skyscraper after it is taken over by German terrorists and he has to rescue his daughter and grandchildren. Two decades later, the skyscraper becomes Nakatomi, the daughter becomes the wife, Leland becomes John McClane and the title becomes Die Hard.To say that Die Hard sets new standards for action movies is like calling Bill Gates well off. The movie was so innovative and groundbreaking that dozens of rip-offs followed - Passenger 57, Under Siege, Cliffhanger, Sudden Death, et al. Hostage/terrorist movies were all the rage in the early Nineties.Very few came close, because Die Hard had so many strong points, not least of which was Alan Rickman's marvellous performance, as Hans Gruber - also the name of the villain in Our Man Flint - the classically educated, smartly dressed terrorist leader. This is not some hammy guy in a chain-mail shirt with spikes on his gloves (Commando). Gruber would have been well at home on Wall Street.His plan is to break into the vault on the 30th floor of the Nakatomi Plaza and take away $640million in negotiable bearer bonds. When he and his 12 European henchmen round up the office workers, who are enjoying a Christmas Eve party, one man slips away unnoticed. He is John McClane, a New York cop who has come to LA to settle down with his estranged wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia). The odds are against him. But that's just the way he likes it.The terrorists even have names. And we remember them. Most action movies these days have unidentified heavies, played by stunt men, who are lined up and knocked over.In his battle to save his Holly, McClane is scorched, torched, beaten and blown up. He jumps off the roof and falls through air ducts. He uncovers deception and double-cross and picks broken glass out of his bare feet. No help comes from the naive and incompetent police, who are unable to get inside, and even less from the FBI.McClane is not a supercop. He is an ordinary guy, who doesn't want a fight. When he is shot, he bleeds. He hurts. All he has are his pants, his vest, his gun - which runs out of ammo. This is the first realistic connection the audience has. When you don't want to be in McClane's position, it makes for much excitement.John McTiernan, who's only previous mainstream movie was Predator, uses awesome photography and technical skills to give the film a truly polished and sophisticated look - it was nominated for four technical Academy Awards. He also allows for enough time for decent character development, most of which comes between McClane and a cop (Reginald Veljohnson) he makes friends with on a CB radio.Die Hard manages to be heart-pounding and teeth-gritting every single time. And if you are one of those many people who have only ever been able to watch it on TV then now is definitely the time to rediscover a cool, classic and creative action picture."
"I first saw Die Hard in the late 1980's and have owned it on various formats down the years and will watch it now and again. One of the main reasons I enjoy it so is because of the iconic place it holds within the action genre. At the time it came out we were mostly served up pumped-up action heroes who happily take on entire armies and win in battles that are mostly a simple matter of good versus evil, where good is US and evil is them (whoever them happened to be at that time). Die Hard manages to be more than that by starting out with a ""normal"" guy as our hero. Now I won't pretend that McClane is not an action hero who does extraordinary things but he seems accessible. I particularly like the fact that his first reaction is to run, to call for help form others and that he only faces the terrorists when he has to, rather than going all Rambo on us.If this approach provides a grounding, the concept also brings the action into a slightly more real environment. The action is more or less confined to the tower and the bad guys limited rather than being a constantly flowing army of stuntmen. Director McTiernan uses the location really well, injecting tension and a sense of claustrophobia that works really well. The action is enjoyable and offers a lesson that modern CGI-heavy action movies can learn from  if you rely totally on technology then you'll date quickly, if you make the effects serve the action and narrative then you'll be standing for years. As a result the action in Die Hard feels no less slick or exciting for being almost twenty years old.Although this is the most important part of the film to get right, I always appreciated the clever subtexts in the narrative. Filmed in the 1980's, the film is a clever attack on yuppie values in contrast with the blue-collar ""man's man"" type. In this way the narrative can be viewed as those seeking more and more wealth getting in the way of those who just want to be with their families. The most obvious attack on the business culture is the aligning of the terrorists and the corporation. Hans and Takagi share taste in suits, education, knowledge and even share the same opening lines (""ladies & gentlemen""); it is not a stretch to see the film suggesting that Takagi may have also shared some of Hans' ruthlessness in his rise to the top. This is also evident from the very start  John does not lose his wife to Hans, he has already lost her to the corporation as she drops his name and had moved away. Indeed such is the films paralleling of these two threats to McClane, that he only rescues Holly from Hans by getting the watch off her wrist  the watch that was specifically mentioned at the start of the film as a gift from the company.Ellis sees the connection being made even more obvious as he himself suggests little difference between himself and Hans, apart from the gun and fountain pen aspect. Of course with both businessmen being connected to the terrorists in this way, they must also share their fate, and do. Although it has lumbered the film series with a rather poor catchphrase, the discussion of westerns again confirms the contrast between ""man's man"" and ""new man""  a connection further made by having McClane in his vest, an outfit more befitting a blue collar worker who has his values in the USA frontier rather than the cut-throat world of foreign business. This distain for bureaucracy is also seen in the redemption of Al. Stuck outside the action in the building (handicapped by incompetence) but also desk-bound due to shooting a kid. At the end of the movie he is redeemed by killing Karl in a ""quick-draw"" style shoot out, freeing him from his desk and restoring his manhood. Again the split between bureaucracy and real workers and again the use of wild-west symbolism.The cast respond to the strong script and direction by turning in roundly good performances. Willis has not really been better (even in the same character) and his action twist on his Moonlighting character was the making of him. It is Rickman that dominates the film though; like in Robin Hood, he is a delightful sneering bad guy who has great lines and great presence. The support cast is good below them with Bedelia avoiding being just a damsel in distress; VelJohnson a solid ""buddy""; Godunov is a real physical threat  even if a few of the other terrorists barely make an impression on the memory. Gleason, Atherton, White and Davi all give a good show as well.Rightly an iconic action movie then. The action has stood up really well and is delivered within a story that is tense and well paced. The performances suit the material and, if you want it, there is a clever and engaging subtext running across the whole film. I find it hard to fault and you can see why it has had the influence it has had on the action genre over the last twenty years."
"This movie is one action-packed ride. Bruce Willis (John McClane) is a New York cop coming to see his wife who has moved to L.A. with their children, hoping for a relaxing Xmas vacation. Instead, he gets a bunch of bad guys who have taken over the Nakatomi building which he and his wife are located in. He hides out, and takes out the bad guys one by one, all while trying to get police attention from the outside world. This movie is tense and full of action. Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman put in outstanding performances. Willis manages to kill all of the bad guys and throw Rickman off the building. If you haven't seen it yet for whatever reason, now is the time to do so."
"There was a moment in an early scene of Die Hard when John McClane (Bruce Willis) is having an argument with his wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) in the executive washroom in Ellis's office. It's scripted so that the two of them end up talking over each other about what McClane's idea of their marriage is, and it's such an honest depiction of estranged spouses that I find myself forgetting what movie I'm watching when I get to that part.Granted, not everyone has a terrorist takeover of their office building to teach them not to take each other for granted, but it works here.That scene is one of the great things about Die Hard, not because it contributes anything to the action, but because it contributes everything to the characters. Most action films before and after this seem violence-driven, but this one manages to balance the humanity of its protagonist, and I can't even begin to measure how much of that balance comes from that one scene.I think the other thing that most defines the spirit of this movie is McClane's shoes. It's such an obvious contrivance, set up right from the beginning, but it's worked into the entire story so artfully that I have completely forgiven it every time I've seen the film. Of all the bad luck, to be caught in the middle of a terrorist attack and then have to chase the bad guys around a 40-story building, all without shoes.But, as McClane himself says, it's ""better than being caught with your pants down."" I know how much of the plot and the action hinges upon luck, timing, strong fingertips, and the Rube Goldberg machinery of the FBI-terrorist interplay, but I really don't care. I still get caught up in the nervous moments of this movie 18 years later. I still ache along with McClane as he pulls a three-inch piece of glass out of his foot in the emergency lighting in the bathroom. And I still root for him to get the bad guy, rescue his wife, save his marriage, and meet Al Powell even though I must have scene this movie 30 or 40 times already, and I know he's going to do it again the next time.This is a great film, and easily the best written and best executed action movie I have ever seen. But more to the point, and more importantly, it's a fun movie to watch, no matter how many times you see it."
"On Christmas eve, John McClane(Bruce Willis) is over at his wife's office party when hi-tech thieves break into said building and look to steal millions of dollars. While collecting hostages in the process, however there is one man who saves the day and it's McClane in what is one of the greatest action movies ever made. I must admit that i'm shocked it took so long to for me to review this. Over the years this has been in my DVD collection, I try to watch it on TV every time it's on and most of all I think it's there with The Terminator,Hunt For Red October and Rocky as the ultimate genre film. The real reason why Die Hard is so great is due to the suspense factor. Sure the action sequences are brilliant and very exciting but what really earns the high marks is just how suspenseful the movie is, it's one of those movies where the hero actually does the most logical things. Unlike the sequels per say, Willis uses the element of surprise and cunning to fight off the bad guys. Unlike the sequels where he was far more one man army. As it stands I remember seeing Die Hard in theaters and remembering being very skeptical of Willis (He was on that show with Cybil Shepherd) but knew right away after watching Die Hard, that Willis would be a great. However as it stands, this movie is a classic. On the other hand it's also a rare instance where one might want to buy a special edition DVD for the extras. Also of note is Alan Rickman who is one of the greatest bad guys ever.* * * * out of 4-(Excellent, A Must See)"
"Bruce Willis is stirring up trouble for the bad guys in ""Die Hard."" In the first of three awesome films, he stars as Lt. John McClane, a New York police officer, who has been invited to the wrong Christmas party.This is an action film for future actors and directors to watch and use as a model because it is what an action film should be. I have seen many action films in my life, but this ranks at the top as it has all the right components. Action packed sequences, explosions, special effects and most of all superb performances with excellent dialogue.""Die Hard"" is a movie I will not soon forget because the story is so well crafted. Though there are no twists or curves thrown at the audience, the audience can be assured they will be treated to two hours of non-stop action from beginning to end.""Die Hard"" did not only produce great action and explosions but future stars as well. I am talking about Clarence Gilyard Jr. who starred in Walker, Texas Ranger and Reginald VelJohnson who starred in the series ""Family Matters."" These two actors were pivotal to this film in their respective roles.Two other names to keep in mind while thinking of key performers are Bonnie Bedelia and Alan Rickman. I was blown away when I saw the impact they had on this film. It is as if they came in and said 'Okay boys, watch out I'm taking over."" They certainly did that; however, nobody could have done better than the impact performer himself Bruce Willis.On a scale of 1-10; ""Die Hard"" is given a 100 by yours truly. My only regret would be that the movie ended. I wish there was more to see in this film. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE ""DIE HARD"" AGAIN."
"When you see this in the shops you can only think of that line, it's one of the true films to be an Action film from start to finish. The best part of this film is it's ages really well, you would think it was made only yesterday, it has one of the biggest stars in history of films Bruce Willis.OK so on to the film, it starts like any other film and sets the scene for what is a roller coaster ride that will leave you wanting more at the end. In the beginning we see John Mcclane (Bruce Willis) on a plane on his way to Los Angeles, the reason he is going there is to meet his wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia who looks really attractive in this film) and it's Christmas Eve.He goes to the Nakatomi Corporation building which is where Holly works to see her and be there for his kids who he hasn't seen in a while, but during the time there he has abit of a fight with her and she gets called to give a talk, anyway John is in the bathroom insulting himself in the way how Bruce Willis does, and he ends up taking his shoes off (the person who he is sat next to on the plane says the best way to get over flying is to take your shoes off and walk bear foot and make fists with your toes...personally never tired it). During the time little does he know that a group of terrorists are planning on taking over the building (this all happens in the first 20 minutes or so).The film then really starts to go into its own as we follow an average police officer from New York in LA trying to just to get home for Christmas, still more about this film. Upon noticing that the building is being taken over by terrorists John escapes and heads to the top floor with work is still going on, and sets off the fire alarm in an attempt to get the police there. When the terrorists find out that hes set the fire alarm off from the top floor they phone the police and tell them that its nothing to worry about and send someone up to kill him, John pleased with his attempt to get back up there looks out the window and swears at them for coming to his aid, then notices they turn around.At this point they send someone up to take him out, and the person ends up getting killed, John having a wicked sense of humour (on both levels of the word) sends the dead body down the lift and takes as much as he can like the machine gun, and cigarettes as you do when your in that sort of situation, and tries on the shoes only to find they are too small. He also writes an amusing note on the persons jumper, meanwhile hes in the lift above the one that stopped taking notes on what hes up against.Later on John goes to the roof of the building to transmit a cry for help to the police and has a fairly amusing conversation on to the police, anyway at this time he gets cut off due to being attacked by the other terrorists, and they choose to send a police officer to search to see if John was telling the truth, anyway the terrorists and John are having a shoot out in one of the offices, and to get the attention John uses his head he throws the body out of the window.Now that he has some help the film moves onto a new level and the action increases more, as police road bloke outside and the FBI get involved the scale of this film (which by the way was made in 1988) starts to show. As John gets in situations and the action increases and has loads of twists and turns.In my view this film has everything to be one of the best if not they best film out there, the scale of it is amazing and the cast is true great. Words cant really describe this film, you really have to watch it, but the film does leave you wanting more and does leave you wanting to watch the next one in the series. I could talk for days about this film and it's action sequences from the very small gun fights to the massive C4 explosion and the plot which doesn't seem to lose it's appeal even after watching it infinite times, and also it's feel good factor at the end when John is back with Holly and they are in the snow (lets face it you knew they would live) but it's got something that does make you want to watch it over and over. If they made more films like this then people would probably remember what cinema is about and we may have really memorable hero's like we use to.This film should be a benchmark for ever other film that is out there trying to be an action film with a strong story, lets face it on paper it's a simple story terrorists want a building for money, they take it over, then John gets caught up in this mess...it's not hard really.But then maybe people like it because it's simple, however I think they like it, or i I like it because it's so original and has never been done before, even Die Hard 2 and 3 they push the idea of films harder and further than before. They go that one more to make it fun and try to make the story still remain simple. It's one film you have to watch and it really should be in the top 250 on IMDb."
"I'm a great fan of Bruce Willis and the fifty odd films which he has starred in, but his role as John McLane in the ""Die Hard"" series would have to be on the top of my list for the best Bruce Willis movie of all time. After watching and probably enjoying the film immensely, you realize how corny, but good the film was. The first few action sequences involve the ultimate bad guy, Hans Gruber (played by Alan Rickman in one of his more solid performances) and are great viewing. They really do set the tone for the rest of the movie, and even for the sequels to follow. But these first few scenes are upstaged by the brilliance of Bruce Willis in his many fight scenes, usually involving gunfire, glass breaking or some kind of explosion! These scenes are enjoyable and all lead to the explosive finale, which leads to a chopper going down, the roof of a building exploding, and a man falling 70 stories to his death. There's also plenty of comic relief in this film, with Argyle, McLanes' limo driver, being oblivious to the anarchy occurring above him whilst he is in the underground car park listening to music and chatting up ladies. Officer Powell, McLanes sidekick outside of the building, also provides a few good laughs. But the two main performances of Willis and Rickman take up mos of the screen time, and rightfully so, as these two characters are brilliant to watch. The Plot line is quite good for such an action-packed film, and it doesn't ever lose any of the intensity it starts out with, if it doesn't gain any that is! All in all, this is a film I recommend for anyone who doesn't take films too seriously, or just wants a good action packed film. Definitely one to put into your DVD or video collection at home."
"Die Hard is one of the best action movies ever made, the acting is great. Bruce Willis does a great job as the hero John McClane and Alan Rickman does a great job as the villain Has Gruber. The action is fantastic and the effects are amazing.The plot sees New York Cop John McClane going to LA to see his family since he's currently separated from his wife Holly, he goes to see her in the huge Nakatomi building. John meets Holly and after an argument in the room John calls his Chauffeur Argyle when suddenly the phone wires are cut, Hans and his men kill the guards and has one of his men disguised as one, they then go to the floor where everyone is and take them hostage. John hears the gun shots and quickly goes through one of the doors. Hans asks to meet the boss of the building and he shows himself then in the office Hans explains to him that he wants the collection of valuable items hidden in the vault, he doesn't tell him the code so he shoots him.John witnesses this and quickly escapes. John activates the smoke alarm so the fire brigade will come, they see on the computer what floor the alarm was raised on so Hans sends one of his men after John but he kills him and takes his weapon and bag. John then goes to the roof to call for help but Hans and his men hear where it's coming from so he sends some of his men to get him, the brother of the man John killed wants to personally kill him. After a firefight on the roof John quickly escapes and the police send an officer to investigate, Sgt. Al Powell. At first he doesn't notice anything but after John throws at body out the window they open fire at his car and once getting to a safe place he calls for reinforcements. The police soon surround them place waiting for the negotiations while John tries to stop them from inside the building.Die Hard is a classic action movie that should be seen. 10/10"
"Bruce Willis gives a amazing performance in perhaps one of the best movies of the 1980s. This is an action/adventure movie for the ages. There are a lot of great scenes, including the scene where Bruce Willis leaps off the rooftop and crashes trough the window. I never thought it would be so good when I first saw it, but I was wrong. Don't miss one of Willis' best films of all time."
"I think this is a great movie. I love the campy one liners and the over the top action, but it was a great movie. It was well paced and they are no real complaints about the movie. Rickman was amazing and it is one of the best bad guys performances and the one scene when we snaps at John's wife is priceless. It is kind of fun to see how a lot of action movies pull from a lot of stuff from this movie (even though I sure this movie got a lot of it's substance from other movies). One of the highlights of the movie is the music and when the bad guys actually manage to open the vault one really feels a swelling of emotion as the music grows. The one problem I have is that the LAPD is not that dumb and the FBI agents are not that dumb and the fact that Al knew better than both of them was kind of silly, but I did like the dynamic of the two FBI agents and the way they fit into the movie as a bunch of idiots, but it was almost a little too much. The humor they tried to inject with the black guy who was cracking the vault was a little dry, but not to the point where I hated him. The limo driver's smile got annoying too, but I liked his character for the most part. Bruce Willis did a perfect job with the character and played him perfect. I like action films like this where there is unnecessary swearing and violence, but it works and I hate how Hollywood is making a lot of action films with a pg-13 rating when i think it would be so much more enjoyable with just letting them swear and be really violent. I know one does not need the violence, but I think it does so much more for the movie experience by letting the characters express themselves with their violence. The last gripe I have is that the ending with Karl jumping up out of nowhere was totally unnecessary and it really annoyed me. The cop did not need a complete arc and John's and his hug was all the ending needed. This will probably always be one of the my favorite action films."

"When people think action - they remember Die Hard. They remember Bruce Willis in his star-making role as that guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. They remember John McClane, they remember Han's Gruber, Holly Generro and Ellis, alright not really Ellis... but everybody will always remember those immortal words, ""Yippee-Ki-Ay Motherf*&ker"" Die Hard is the ultimate action film, packed with all the firepower you can handle and enough C4 to level a building. It's and a genuine no-holds-barred roller coaster ride from beginning to end.With a relatable everyman John McClane, (Bruce Willis in his iconic role - brilliant)and a sinister villain in Han's Gruber (Alan Rickman)Die Hard has the action-genre by the balls and sets a standard in this genre that has never been equaled. ""Welcome to the party, pal!"""
"Based on ex cop Roderick Thorpe's 1979 novel Nothing Lasts Forever, Die Hard, directed by John McTiernan, changed the face of the action movie. Starring Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, Bonnie Bedelia, Reginald Veljohnson, Alexander Godunov, William Atherton & Paul Gleason, McTiernan's movie went on to make over $100 million in profit at the box office alone. Spawning three equally successful sequels (at the time of writing), it began a franchise that showed that if done well, the action movie could be a dominant force in the world of cinema. The set up is relatively simple, Willis plays New York cop John McLane who during the Christmas holidays is in L.A. to visit his estranged wife Holly (Bedelia). She works for the Japanese Corporation of Nakatomi, and currently she's attending the company Christmas party up on the 30th floor of the humongous Nakatomi Plaza tower block. Bad day at the office because a group of apparent German terrorists, led by the charismatic Hans Gruber (Rickman), take the whole building hostage: with one exception; McLane, who evades capture and launches a one man war against the terrorists. What follows is just over two hours of high octane action, smart dialogue and technical smarts. McTiernan had already endeared himself to the action movie fan with the ball busting beef stew that was Predator in 87, a fact not lost on Die Hard's co producer Joel Silver, who clearly knew that McTiernan could smoothly shift the action from the Val Verde jungle to the urban jungle of L.A. And he did. Next was to get the right man for McLane. Richard Gere was first choice but passed, so the makers took a gamble on Willis, whose career was at a standstill after his leap from TV show Moonlighting on to the big screen with the likes of Blind Date & Sunset barely making a ripple in Hollywood. The rest for Willis, as they say, is history. McLane is an everyman hero, streetwise, even slobbish, but identifiable to many with his work ethics, desperate heroics and emotional vulnerability. Willis attacks the role with a hunger rarely seen from the big male earners in filmdom. During the two hours and ten minute running time of Die Hard, Willis as McLane changed the face of the action hero for ever; even making a dirty white vest iconic in the process; the latter of which couples nicely with the hero being bare footed throughout for a nifty bit of writing. Across the board the casting is flawless, Bedelia is spunky and driven, a woman worth fighting for. Veljohnson as beat copper Al Powell-McLane's walkie-talkie buddy and only link to the outside world-is memorable because it feels real, he has his own issue gnawing away at him, but his exchanges with Willis keeps the humanity grounded as the carnage unfolds. Gleason & Atherton are wonderfully anal as Deputy Police Chief and TV Reporter respectively, while Hart Bochner as Ellis dishes out one of the best weasel turns to have ever graced a movie featuring corporate suit types. But as Die Hard resembles the great Westerns of yesteryear, much like the great Oaters, Die Hard could only be as good as its chief villain. As Willis' McLane ushered in a new action hero to copy, Rickman's uber intelligent villain set a new benchmark. Snappily dressed, well versed and as charming as they come, Gruber in Rickman's hands is a villain you could quite easily root for! That's further testament to Willis' turn that Rickman doesn't walk away with the movie, both men are from different sides of the fence, good and evil, yet both are characters you can hang your hat on. Quite a trick from McTiernan that. Rickman is ably supported by the scary Godunov as right hand man Karl and Clarence Gilyard Jr. as the cold hearted Theo. Elsewhere the impact of Robert Davi & Grand L. Bush as the two cocksure FBI agents Johnson & Johnson (no relation) should not be underestimated. All the actors, of course, are indebted to the sizzling script by Steven E. de Souza & Jeb Stuart. So to is praise due to photographer Jan de Bont, who in collaboration with McTiernan, produces a camera work lesson for action movies, as the camera swoops in and around the tower, down elevator shafts and up tilt to roofs; with the fight scenes afforded a spatial sheen not expected in the confines of a tower block setting (the film was actually shot at 20th Century Fox's own 2121 Fox Plaza). Even the scoring from Michael Kamen and the sound tracking are of a high standard; check out the various ""mood"" uses of Beethoven's Ode to Joy from Symphony No.9 and Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 In G Major: Brilliant. The 80s was well served by action movies with the likes of Lethal Weapon and Beverly Hills Cop proving massively popular. But just as Raiders Of The Lost Ark changed the game for action/adventure, so too did Die Hard. It's now the benchmark movie for action, a film that unlike Hills Cop & Lethal Weapon remarkably shows no signs of ageing either. It's no monkey in the wrench or a fly in the ointment, it's the daddy, and the one that all other action movies have to answer to. 10/10"
"I've seen many action films over the years, but few have had an impact like Die Hard. Bruce Willis gives one of the best (if not THE best) performances of his film career. This is quite simply, my favourite action film of all time.Willis plays NYPD cop John McClane, who has come to LA to be with his estranged wife Holly, (Bonnie Bedelia) and their children for Christmas. To my knowledge, Die Hard is one of the few action films set at Christmas. This makes Die Hard rather unique for the genre, but the seasonal setting does nothing to detract from the action, and its still a gripping film to watch.Getting back to the plot, McClane heads for the Nakatomi Plaza, a 40 storey skyscraper, Holly's workplace, to pick her up from the Nakatomi Corporation's annual Christmas party. But just after a heated discussion concerning the breakdown of their marriage, a group of German terrorists led by Hans Gruber (the brilliant Alan Rickman) seize control of the building.McClane manages to escape detection, and where the action kicks into overdrive. Willis makes a very likable hero as John McClane, because he comes across as a more down to earth guy than other action heroes. An example is when the terrorists first seize the building, but instead of trying to be a hero, he just runs and tries to call for help.This is believable behaviour to me, and you would expect anyone thrust into the same situation to do just that. Since the action is confined to an LA skyscraper, it makes for a more claustrophobic atmosphere and environment. With McClane crawling through air ducts and elevator shafts, the camera angles have you right in his face. In some ways, Die Hard reminds me of The Towering Inferno, the classic Irwin Allen film also set in a skyscraper. But they are still two very different films, with Die Hard being more about action.McClane must now wage a one man war against Rickman's terrorists. It may sound ludicrous for one man to single-handedly pick off a group of heavily armed terrorists, but in this film it works. I think its because of Willis' likable performance of an ordinary man plunged into an extraordinary situation. I like the way he wears that white vest, that becomes increasingly dirtier as the film goes on. To me, this symbolises his transition from ordinary joe to the one man army he's been forced to become.Alan Rickman oozes evil as Hans Gruber, who is principally interested in the 640 million dollars worth of negotiable bearer bonds in the Nakatomi building's vault. He is in complete control of the situation, even when McClane is causing high rise havoc with everything from automatic weapons to plastic explosives.Rickman never loses his cool, and gets a lot of great lines. He even finds time to mock McClane, likening him to a cowboy. This is where McClane's famous catchphrase comes from Yippie Kayee Mother F###er. I like the way Rickman has the police (and later the FBI) at a complete disadvantage, bluffing his way past them about comrades in arms to keep them occupied. He simply weaves them into his plan, and he skillfully manipulates them to play right into his hands. This is a rare thing in an action film, where neither hero, nor villain upstages the other.Reginald VelJohnson is also great as Sgt Al Powell, the only ally McClane has with the cops on the outside. Although they talk via radio, the two have great chemistry, and I like the scene when Al confides in McClane how he accidentally shot a kid, even though they've never met. This illustrates the bond between them. McClane returns the favour when asking Al if he could tell Holly he's sorry their marriage didn't work out. This shows his more sensitive side, but I think it shows depth to McClane's character, and doesn't come across as soppy. That's why he's such a great hero.The stunts are incredible, in particular when McClane has to jump off the roof tied to a fire hose. I like the way he says just before he's about to jump ""Oh God, please don't let me die"", compared to some other action heroes like Schwarznegger or Stallone who would probably just jump. This again demonstrates what a realistic character he is playing.Nailbiting stuntwork and spectacular pyrotechnics are impressive, and never overshadow the characterisation built upon throughout the film. The action scenes serve the plot, when in most action films, it is the other way around. There are some people who won't like the swearing (and even I found some of it unnecessary) but the film is still a masterpiece of action. Definitely John McTiernan's best film (although Predator was almost on a par) and its so stylish and witty right up to the nailbiting conclusion.Die Hard even succeeds as a knowing commentary on the action film genre, dropping references to other action heroes, and exemplifies Bruce Willis as a new type of hero. One that can get hurt, one that feels pain, and one that actually has ties to the world.The best of the Die Hard series, and I love the Christmas song Let it Snow, Let it Snow, Let it Snow on the end credits to remind you it is still Christmas even after all this. Not to mention how liberating it is to watch a corporate building going up in flames.Die Hard set a whole new standard for action films to come. There have been many imitations since, but none have ever managed to top the unforgettable adventure of Die Hard."
"Exhilarating, thrill to-the-moment joyride that will have you cheering! Tough New York City cop, John McClane (Bruce Willis) travels to Los Angeles on an invitation by a powerful corporate leader to celebrate at a Christmas Eve Party, where McClane's estranged wife (Bonnie Bedella) is attending. This was supposed to be a peaceful, joyous occasion, but before McClane could reconcile with his wife,internationally based terrorists lead by Hans Gouber (Alan Rickman, in a terrific performance) and his assistant (the late Alexander Godunov in a fine supporting role) hijack the tall skyscraper. Several hostages are killed, and the police and FBI have been called in to negotiate.What follows is a non-stop spectacle of stunts, explosions, and amazing action cheorography. Hans Gouber has kept several of the patrons hostage, and he assumed only too much that he had tied all the loose ends. However, Gouber and his mercenaries have not counted on McClane to intervene on the action! The stakes are rising though...as McClane's wife is among one of several hostages captured at this moment.Don't count McClane out yet!DIE HARD is a one-of-kind action movie that has a breathtaking pace and offers plenty of wits between McClane and Gouber. Bruce Willis gives an excellent performance as McClane, the ordinary guy who has entered the wrong scenario at the right time. Alan Rickman made a terrifying villian, Hans Gouber. Bonnie Bedella was annoying but hysterical as a wiseacre ex-wife turned hostage. The direction by John McTieran (PREDATOR, THE LAST ACTION HERO) was not short of being superb and first class.DIE HARD is one action packed movie that offers thrills, excitement, and plenty of fast paced humor and wisecracks from Willis. The action is fast and furious, and the film pulls enough punches to keep the energy flowing! DIE HARD is simply one of the most cinematic action masterpieces ever. It is often a rarity to see such a white knuckle adventure that keeps you on the edge of the seat throughout the entire film. Bravo!RATING: ***1/2 out of ****."
"1988 saw the peak of modern action films. It will be forever imitated but never bettered. White vests and catchphrases at the ready..Its DIE HARD John Mclane is a New York cop, recently separated from his wife Holly. Holly works for a big business company in the heart of California and is celebrating the opening of a new mega-plex building 'Nakatomi'. She invites on-off husband to the opening ceremony and his arrival quite nicely co-insides with the arrival of a group of party-spoiling terrorists led by a German named Hans Gruber. Good job he brought his gun then! Directed by John Mctiernan, Die Hard, saw the first and best action film with soul, and a lead hero who wasn't actually invincible. Struggling with the issues of doing his job, saving his wife, escaping from the building etc, John Mclane comes across as someone who actually has a heart, someone who can be beaten and above all, someone we can genuinely like.The film follows Mclanes exploits as he scurries around the 'Nakatomi' plaza evading terrorist grasp whilst trying to help cops on the outside diffuse the situation. He's not an Arnie type character whos just there to empty a few clips, he's simply stuck in the situation and just doing the best he can, which incidentally sometimes isn't all that much.There is a particularly good scene where Mclane succumbs to the likelihood that he may never escape alive and in a heartwarming scene, relays a message to a cop on the outside 'Al' to pass on to his wife. Fighting tears whilst trying to remove shards of glass from the feet of his broken body, we find that this guy is real. He's human, and very much destructible. Hence we back his corner more.Bruce Willis stars as the said cop, elevating him to super stardom from then on. It was a film requiring excellent acting skills over a toned physique and casting was spot on. Alan Rickman plays the terrorist leader Hans Gruber and Bonny Bodelia Mclanes wife Holly. All parts are played superbly, further increasing the immersion.Now, Die Hard IS still an action film. There's a lot of explosions, fighting, swearing and heroics but thanks to great scripting, acting and directing, it never becomes clichéd. The pacing is spot on. Scenes of dialogue are freed by a gun-fight and harrowing scenes, followed by hate-fuelled violence. Its got explosions, but never too many, dead bodies, but never dwelled upon, its got swearing, but never for swearings sake and its even got a catchphrase, but even that is believable given the feelings and emotions going through Mclane as he battles for his own life as well as his wife and hostages. And thats the key to its success: Perfect pacing and perfect balance.This all may sound very deep for an action film, and it probably is, but when you watch it you'll most probably think..'That was absolutely amazing' and you wont know why. Well this is best an analysis i could make. We sit there and just take for granted how much effort goes on in the background.Wise people say that 'when you've done your job right, people wont know you've done anything at all' Here here i say.Yipee-Kiyay! movie lovers"
"1988 and the undisputed number one action star was that Austrian body builder with the funny name with that monosylabic guy from ROCKY in second place . The thing I hated about Arnie and Sly is that their action movies were uninvolving with over blown battle scenes where the good guys never seemed to be in danger of dying . I was also going to bring the James Bond franchise into the conversation but the series became a parody when Bond stopped speaking with a Scottish accent sometime in the early 70s
DIE HARD is different to the other 80s action fests with John McLane being a fairly believable genre character . Okay he`s two dimensional but that`s got to be one dimension more than John Rambo who only exists to kill a lot of nasty commies so Americans can flock to the cinema . It`s also interesting to note that McLane`s wife is used in the plot which is slightly different from how most action films work out where the hero is normally single , but that`s probably because DIE HARD as more depth to it than many contemparies. Perhaps the biggest difference is that McLane is slightly flawed as we`re shown one scene where the hero gives the bad guys something they want , not something you`d see in a Arnie or Sly movie . I won`t mention the stunts or the tightly written set pieces or how compelling they are because everyone else has beat me to it , except to say that big explosions and gun fights often overwhelm an action movie ( Bond movies are a good example ) but here they occur from the narrative instead of someone cramming them into the script in a vain attempt to thrill the audience . Normally I`d have a fit that an action blockbuster is well inside the IMDB top 250 but DIE HARD does deserve to be there since it`s the best movie of its type of its era ."
"Spoilers herein.Here's a conundrum: the vacation action thrillers that star unkillable heros themselves die a quick death. Even a short time later they are limp. Seen ""Speed"" lately? Each is a matter of repetition with the heat turned up a very little, so the next guy always makes it obsolete.But not this one. I've stopped by every few years, and it never seems dated. (Well, maybe the pseudo-terrorist plot.) But its just in a whole different category than any Arnie movie. They fade fast. I think it is a matter of originality, pacing and the stance that Willis invented. The pacing really is a black art, and to judge from McTeirnan's subsequent missteps, was an accident. But I have to give Bruce Willis a lot of credit. We live in an era when we expect nothing to be done straight. Some ironic coloring is expected, some compact between the film and the audience that gives us traction on which to build fun. Sly, Arnie, Chuck and those others take it all so seriously. Bruce, and later Mel (with less intelligence) would first establish their character with the audience as their man, their representative in the action.Then, once in a while, he'd all but look at the camera and say ""ain't this a gas, watch this!""I don't pretend that Bruce is a fine actor, but he certainly reinvented film. And in his own way as much as Brando. This is his ""streetcar.""It is important in the history of film, and in how we as a society deal with abstraction. And it is still fun, with the ""cancel Christmas"" guy.Ted's evaluation: 3 of 4 -- worth watching"
"This is by far one of my favorite Christmas movies to rewatch over the holiday season. Lots of action, good plot, great characters and lots of subtle details to catch over multiple viewings."
"Die hard is a hilarious, action packed, violent festive thriller that follows new York cop John McClain trying to defend his wife's office building the Nakatomi plaza from European terrorists. the performances are spot on, and the dialogue is forever quotable.
yippee ki yay motherfxxker"
"It's almost unfathomable that in just one year's time, the original entry in the ""Die Hard"" saga will be thirty years old. And yet, even then, it will still remain in its position as indisputably the greatest action-adventure ever committed to the screen. In every way remarkable, entertaining and breathlessly exhilarating, it is the quintessential gold-standard when it comes to action. A masterpiece of filmmaking, ""Die Hard"" took the world by storm in 1988 and even with inconsistent quality in sequels, it still enthralls and entertains thanks to sharp writing, perfect casting, exquisite performances and top-notch direction. It's hard to imagine that anything will ever top it.Bruce Willis stars as Detective John McClane, a New York cop who flies out to Los Angeles to spend Christmas with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) and children. Arriving at a massive Christmas Party at Holly's workplace in Nakatomi Plaza, things start to seem like they might be looking up for John... until a group of terrorists, lead by the vile Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) seize control of the building, hoping to get their hands on over half a billion dollars in bearer bonds that are locked away in the vault. Escaping the threat and discovering that the police will be completely unable to help, John realizes he must work alone, eluding capture and taking out terrorists one by one if he is to save the day...Directed by John McTiernan from a script by Jeb Stuart and Steve E. de Souza, the film as just exquisitely assembled. McTiernan's keen eye for visuals and perfect sense of pacing and composition allow the tension and excitement to build with virtually every second as the story progresses and the stakes rise. But he also knows when to pull back and give the characters breathing room to develop and just talk with one another, without rushing through it or over-relying on broad archetypes as many more modern filmmakers do. Absolutely amazing direction. The screenplay (inspired loosely by the Roderick Thorp novel ""Nothing Lasts Forever"") is exceptionally well put- together. de Souza and Stuart craft an instantly identifiable and highly likable cast of characters- including villains you very much love to hate- that all get their proper moment to shine and all feel well-defined and developed. The structure of the film is also very sound, and they strike a perfect balance between story and action in a way few other films have.We are treated to one of the finest casts to ever populate a tale of adventure in the film. Much has already been said about Bruce Willis and his iconic turn in the role of McClane, but it is still not enough. Bruce Willis just might be the ideal action hero. He's tough, but not unstoppable. Smart, but not a genius. And sharp- witted, but with a certain sense of vulnerability. In many ways, he's the sort-of person anyone and everyone can identify with, and that's what makes McClane such an incredible hero. Alan Rickman- in his first starring role- absolutely steals the show as the villainous Hans, a presence who will charm you, even while you root for him to go down. Rickman is a talent that was taken too soon after his tragic passing last year, and it's roles like this that prove just how great a loss it was. Supporting roles by the likes of Bedelia and William Atherton are exceptional for the material. And Reginald VelJohnson is just magical as Sgt. Al Powell, a cop who offers support to McClane over the radio throughout the film's runtime.Beyond the cast, the direction and the writing is just simply a phenomenal overall production. Cinematographer Jan de Bont, who would later go on to become a director in his own right, paints a beautiful cinematic image, with outstanding work done, particularly in the lighting and color. Composer Michael Kamen's score is just a blast of pure fun. With a sort-of old-fashioned scope yet a modern flair, the music constantly and consistently compliments the images on-screen perfectly, and it's such a relief that his themes were used in each subsequent film. And editors Frank J. Urioste and John F. Link expertly manipulate the footage so that every shot... every emotion... everything is in service to the story and characters. Now THIS is how you film and cut an action film!In the end, ""Die Hard"" may soon be turning thirty years old, but it remains as exciting, engaging and enthralling as ever. Upon initial release, it became the perfect example of an adventure done right, and blew audiences away. And it continues to do that now. I honestly have my doubts that anything will ever be able to beat it in terms of quality in storytelling and execution of action. It simple is the best action movie ever made. And for that, it easily earns a perfect 10 out of 10."
"The 80s Gave us many great action movies from The Terminator, Predator and The Road Warrior to Commando, Big Trouble in Little China and Escape From New York. But Die Hard in my opinion is the best of them all. The Main Character is great. He's relatable and likable and he's not a superhero, in fact he gets his butt kicked constantly throughout the movie. The Villain is also great. The Late Alan Rickman does a fantastic job playing this character. The action scenes are quite brutal and violent but very realistic. The humour is hilarious with some of the best one liners in cinema history. My only real problem with this movie is some of the supporting characters, mainly the police. Most of them are incredibly annoying and it gets so irritating when they constantly don't believe anything the main character is telling them about the terrorists. But even with that Die Hard is still my favorite action film of the 80s(And my favorite Christmas movie too)."
"Die Hard still remains, to this day, one of the best action films of all time. Directed by John McTiernan (The Hunt for Red October, Predator) and written by Jeb Stuart (The Fugitive), the story packs a great amount of action and suspense with memorably immortal characters.The acting: This was the film that propelled Bruce Willis to absolute stardom. Starring as the charismatic Officer John McClane of the NYPD, Willis lacks the Schwarzenegger-esque physique but shows us you don't need bulging muscles to defeat your foes. Rather, he is presented as the everyday Joe who is thrust into a flurry of German terrorists. His screen presence is strong throughout, with his witty one-liners (Yippy-Ki-yay, motha*****) and believable character development. There are smaller details presented where Willis reveals more of a vulnerable side to him (usually when he is alone) that perfectly contrasts his 'cop machismo'. As he barely escapes one threat presented after another, we are reminded that this is a normal guy in a highly abnormal situation.Another character who absolutely owns his screen time is Hans Gruber, played by an electric Alan Rickman. He gives a spectacular performance as the leader of the terrorists - conniving, intelligent and also has a comical side. His subtly sinister demeanor keeps us on the edge of our seat and we relish his every move. Perhaps that is why Die Hard has succeeded where so many other action films have failed. We are equally engrossed by both the virtuous and villainous figures presented.The screenplay: Taking place in predominantly one area for the majority of the film, Die Hard delivers one taut thrill after another. The sense of realism and grittiness does not seem too far-fetched, even for an action flick. The explosions are not superfluous and the gore is not unnecessary – it all helps in developing McClaine's character and shows us the right extent of how chaotic things become for him.I particularly loved the meta-humor (""This time John Wayne does not walk off into the sunset with Grace Kelly."" ""That was Gary Cooper, a**hole."") And banter was common in this film, whether it being between Hans and John, John and Office Powell. The superb dialogue, acting and direction manage to elevate this film an echelon above its action-film wannabes."
"""Die Hard"" is simply put one of the very best action movies that's ever been committed to film. Absolutely everything about the movie is perfect, or very close to it. Starting with Bruce Willis as the star, who finds himself caught up, totally unprepared, in a ""terrorist"" situation where a Japanese corporation's L.A. office building is taken over by heavily armed, highly trained German terrorists (or mercenaries, or maybe just thieves.)Alan Rickman is an incredible villain in this who steals every scene he's in.The best part about this movie is that it is much more believable and realistic than other action movies. He's a flawed cop, barefoot, and he actually makes mistakes and gets very badly hurt. The good guys aren't perfect. It's largely luck as well as his own toughness and ingenuity that get him through each gunfight, and his need to get his wife (who works for the corporation) back from the bad guys. Incredible story, pitch perfect acting, lots of great comic relief moments (the dad from Family Matters is in it!), fantastic action sequences. This movie is a must see for action lovers!"
"Die Hard is really a work of art. It was one of the most influential action films today. Filmmakers are always trying to make the Die Hard of today. Die Hard is about a vulnerable everyday man trapped in a small restrictive area, and completely outnumbered.Bruce Willis plays John McClane, a New York cop that is going to LA for his wife's Christmas party at her work. Meanwhile a team of 13 terrorist, (not 12 like it says) lead by Hans Gruber played by Alan Rickman take over the Nakatomi plaza. Now it's up to John McClane, the man at the wrong place at the wrong time to stop the terrorists' plot.The acting from everyone is top notch. Willis is incredibly likable as John McClane and the supporting cast all do good with their roles. But the show stealer is Alan Rickman, who brings a sense of sophistication and class to the diabolical Hans Gruber. He is a guy you love to hate.One of my favourite things about the Die Hard series is the character of John McClane. I love his attitude, he kind of is a jerk that butts heads with a lot of figures who disagree with him like the police in this movie. But he still cares about people, which is why he became a cop. I love his relationships with the villains which is usually full of teasing, arguing and insulting each other which is always fun to watch.The film is a excellent blend of very intense moments, gripping drama, great action and stunt work, and a good sense of humour. Die Hard has stood the test of time as one of the greatest action films of all time."
"John McTiernan's second mainstream film manages to amazingly top an outstanding previous effort, Predator. This even better film will resonate will audiences even more than Predator. While Predator was a superbly crafted and fairly straightforward sci-fi action thriller, this film takes the archetypal imperfect everyman loner, saddled with personal issues(in the form as an estranged relationship with is corporate high flying wife) and through a twist of fate has him battling, against the odds an international team of highly motivated and competent) bank robbers while trying to protect his wife, who is amongst the hostages these robbers have taken. It differed from both Predator and other action-thriller films of the period in that the hero was more human in physique, rather than the physical super-men such as Stallone, Norris and Schwarzenegger. He survives through determination and his wits rather than on brute strength, and Bruce Willis was a refreshingly original casting choice.The plot is cleverly structured and sets up all the characters seamlessly. There are good performances from most of the key players. The robbers are all interesting, but clearly most time is spent with Clarence Gilyard Jr. and the late Alexander Gudunov, who are both charismatic, albeit it is their boss, the relatively unknown at the time British actor Alan Rickman, who steals the show and is terrific in this film, and makes for a worthy rival and antagonist for Bruce Willis's John McClane. Bonnie Bedelia and Reginald Veljohnson are also good value, as is James Shigeta as Mr Takagi. However a couple of the characters do stray into caricatures, notably De'Voreaux White and Hart Bochner as Argyle and Ellis respectively. Fortunately the other performances and the film itself as so fast paced and involving you can overlook these slightly over the top performances, and they do not detract from the enjoyment of the picture.The good performances are woven into an expertly crafted film. Technical credits are outstanding. Jan De Bont's photography is stylish, and makes fantastic use of the Fox Plaza Tower to double for the Nakatomi building. He also makes clever use, but not over use of lens flares to create an excellent mood and atmosphere. Frank J Urioste's stunning editing, Michael Kamen's great music and Richard Edlund's brilliant but incredibly subtle visual effects all work together with truly fantastic action sequences and stuntwork, and director John McTiernan deserves huge credit. He draws out entertaining performances from most of the cast, but mixes this brilliantly clever setting up of the characters, and then orchestrating some truly outstanding action sequences with a pervading atmosphere of growing tension and suspense. It has stood the test of time brilliantly, it still by some way the best of the series, and overall comes off as a truly outstanding and emotionally satisfying thriller.Overall a terrific achievement that has not been bettered."
"Die Hard (1988) *** (out of 4)Enjoyable and tense thriller about a group of terrorists (led by Alan Rickman) who overtake a L.A. skyscraper and the only thing keeping them from getting away with their crime is a New York police officer (Bruce Willis) there on vacation. There's a lot of very good things about this movie but I've always thought that the majority of the credit has to go to star Willis. He might not have been a A-list star at the time this was released but it's easy to see why he became one afterwards. I think what's so great about him and the character he plays is that we can believe he's just your typical guy you'd see walking around on the streets with you. That every-day-man quality that Willis has works so well here because of the odds stacked against his character you can't help but just sit back and enjoy this one person taking out a professional organization. The hilarious one-liners, the smart remarks and the way Willis makes himself know to the terrorists is just classic and we get so many great showdowns that you can't help enjoy all of them. It certainly doesn't hurt that you've got a strong supporting cast with Rickman being a villain you just love to hate. The coldness RIckman brings to the part is the perfect contrast to Willis' cop and it works perfectly. Reginald VelJohnson, William Atherton, Bonnie Bedelia and Paul Gleason also add great support for Willis to play off of. The action scenes are certainly some of the best you're going to see and what holds them together so well is the direction by John McTiernan. He perfectly blends the humor, tension and the action but he also gives the film a wonderful pace that keeps it moving at a fast rate. DIE HARD might be far-fetched in what one man is able to do but this really doesn't take away from any of the fun."
"I praise this movie just because it's a great action film. And it has great acting which makes it a classic. And so on. John McClane. After watching this movie, that's a person you would like to become. It starts with John McClane flying into California to see his wife in a tall forty-story skyscraper. He's a New York cop, and of course he's confused and disgusted with the California mood and humor. Then the terrorists arrive. Coincidence that it's the same night John McClane has arrived. John sneaks out unnoticed and tries to save all the Californian hostages and his wife from the death-threatening terrorists. He's a cop, so he has skill. Another good thing about this movie is that most of it is believable. Some can disagree, but for the most part, it's pretty realistic. Die Hard is both violent, which is good for this film, has lots of cursing, which some people can find unnecessary, but I think it's great, and the movie is sometimes humorous. I enjoyed watching this movie, just because it's good. Just plain good."
"Now this is what action movies are all about. ""Die Hard"" stars Bruce Willis as New York officer John McClane, a cop who gets trapped in a high-rise in LA when terrorists come to steal a substantial sum from the building's safe. He single-handedly ends up defeating the entire team of terrorists. Although the film's action scenes are great (especially the classic one involving McClane jumping out of the building holding onto a fire hose), it is the interactions between McClane and Sergeant Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson) and villain Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) that make the movie what it really is. Rickman plays one of the greatest movie villains, as he combines evil with humor, as every villain should. His performance was Oscar-worthy, in my opinion. It's great dialogue and fun characters that set ""Die Hard"" apart from most other action movies. Its three sequels are all great too, but this film is still superior. Always in my top 5.**** out of ****"
"All I can say is WOW....OK, I lied, I can say more.Die Hard is one of those movies that is all good action and a good plot: something very rarely seen in the action genre, but it does exist apparently.NYPD Officer John McClane (Bruce Willis) is in L.A. visiting his wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) at her office for a party. However, a band of European terrorists led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) soon storm the place and take everyone hostage, except for McClane. Its up to McClane to stop the terrorists and save the hostages.Acting-wise, everyone should have gotten an award for their part. Not a single weak performance here, also no unlikable characters, you pretty much appreciate everyone.Willis' character was the best by far. He was funny, skilled and there was no way you couldn't like him or at least get a laugh or two out of his comments or sneaky tactics.There is plenty of action along with enough background to adequately cover everyone's motives. There are many great scenes too. You will not feel like you wasted your time watching Die Hard.10/10"
"This is the action movie that redefined the genre, spawned a host of imitations, and launched Bruce Willis to international super-stardom. He also redefined the action hero, along with Mel Gibson. John McLane (Willis) comes to L.A. to spend Christmas with his family and try to reconcile with his wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), who took their children there to advance her career. Why is it that when a woman breaks up her marriage to advance her career it's admirable, but if a man does it, he's an insensitive JERK? (Personally, I see this as a prime example of feminist/liberal hypocrisy. Then they have the nerve to accuse MEN of having double standards!) Anyway, he goes to meet her at a Christmas party at her office, and gets mad at her when he finds out she's using her maiden name. As he's berating himself in the private room for starting an argument with her, a gang of thieves come in, kill all the guards, cut off all outside communications, take everyone at the party hostage, and try to get the head honcho, Joseph Takagi (James Shigeta), to give them the access code to the security vault so they can steal $650 million worth of bearer bonds. When he tells the ringleader, Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), that he doesn't know the access code, which changes every day, Hans blows his brains out, with John hiding in the room watching. We soon come to know that Hans has the most dangerous combination of traits, high intelligence and total amorality. He then proceeds with his plan, which is to PRETEND to be terrorists, because he's studied the FBI's terrorist response plan, and intends to use it to help them break into the security vault. I'm not going to reveal much more of the plot. Instead I'm going to discuss how Bruce changed the character of the action hero forever, and showed great acting ability in the process. Previously, action heroes had generally been portrayed as fearless one dimensional characters who were so tough they could go through anything and anybody who stood in their way with hardly a scratch. To give them credit, both Arnold and Sly tried to give some of their characters added depth, but neither of them had really developed the range to be convincing at that stage of their careers. Bruce broke the mold by portraying John McLane as a normal guy who happened to be a police detective caught up in an abnormal situation. At first he's frightened and tries to get some outside help, but when he realizes the thieves are controlling all outside communication, he uses his brains to become the ""..fly in the ointment. The monkey in the wrench. The pain in the a$$."" to both disrupt the thieves' planned timetable and get them angry. Because he knows that the angrier he makes them, the less clearly they'll be able to think, and the more they'll concentrate on trying to kill him instead of sticking to their plan. He also knows this'll give him the chance to whittle down the opposition. He also shows vulnerability, fallibility, frustration, pain, anguish, and determination. He also uses a good deal of profanity, but it's never gratuitous. He uses it to control his own fear and to put his enemies even further off balance. I understand that Bruce ad-libbed many of his one-liners.Finally, I've only seen one other commenter that got the real point of this movie. John McLane's primary motivation through all of this is LOVE! All he wants is to get himself and his wife out of the situation alive so they can go home to their children. So the real point of this movie is that true love truly does conquer all! What real man doesn't hope somewhere in his heart that if HIS woman were in such deadly danger that HE would have the love and the courage of John McLane? That's what lifts this movie head and shoulders above all the mindless action movies, and makes it not just a guy movie, but a movie a guy can watch with his best girl, and tell her that he loves her enough that HE would run barefoot through broken glass to save her life if he had to. That's why I consider this movie a masterpiece and rate it at 10/10. Yippie-ki-yay, motherf#&%er!"
"Bruce Willis created an icon with John Mclane,an easy guy to like but a hard man to kill.The film is action-packed and suspenseful, with some very human elements in it.Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber has to be the greatest movie villain of all time,Rickman's facial expressions are priceless.And Bonnie Bedellia is equally good.The movie has great Oscar nominated special effects witch puts you on the edge of your seat while Mclane's one-liners make you laugh.The action is non-stop and the villains truly DIE HARD.The film is legendary,you will never forget it.So sit back and enjoy edge of your seat suspense.""Yippie Ki Yay motherf*cker""-John Mclane"
"Where do you go when things in your city are quiet? Los Angeles, ""The City of Angels"". That is where New York policeman John McClane(Bruce Willis) will spend his Christmas at. At least for the holidays, because his wife Holly(Bonnie Bedelia) is living. The holidays are going fine until a group of European terrorists ruin the fun. After taking himself a shower, John is very maverick decides to take on the terrorists with a 9mm, and barefoot. Normally, police offers are very resourceful, for John he really is. The only contact had to go on is LA Policeman Sgt. Al Powell(Reginald VelJohnson) those two kept in touch, until the menace was over. When they finally meet, New York and LA will never clash again! John's limo driver Argyle(DeVereoux White) did his part on taking out the computer hacker(Clarence Gilyard, Jr.) This movie is totally non-stop. It was never a dull moment. The music choices were great, and the surprises never stop. A major keeper! 4 out of 5 stars!"
This is by far the most exciting action movie I have ever seen. There is a lot of shooting and things that get blown up. This movie was Bruce Willis's first big movie. He stars as John Mcclane a New York cop who flies to LA to see his Wife and kids for Christmas. Then while people are taken hostage by the bad guys Mcclane escapes and starts shooting the terrorists one at a time. My favorite part was when Mcclane throws a chair with c-4 on it down the elevator shaft and a big part of the building blows up. This movie has been copied a lot but is still very fun to watch. Alan Rickman plays the leader of the bad guys and is very scary. I also enjoyed the two sequels and I am really looking to the Fourth one coming out in 2007. A definite 10 out of 10
"This is a classic action film and benifits so much from mctiernan directing that it really makes it into the realm of classic films. Apart from a very young looking Willis Playing a hard boiled new yoik cop there a tons of other ace characters. Alan Rickman is a superb villain and Hart Bochner plays Ellis: one of the funniest film characters i have ever seen (show him the watch..go on show him the watch). for me however the real gem is the films ""heartwarming"" moment at the end. A veteran cop who learns to kill once again, having been out of action after a mistake. In doing so he saves Willis from death. This is some classic action that is up there with predator for sheer quality."
"The first of its kind that created a genre of its own. The direction of John McTiernan packs a wallop. What's interesting to see is how McClane conquers his internal conflict in the bathroom, so he may defeat his external conflict and finally decides to get outta there to find out what the fck Hans was doing upstairs. And from the start it wasn't a rescue mission, he was having a conversation with his wife... something that started 6 months earlier, only to get cut off. Also interesting to see the antag from being passive to becoming reactive when McClane steals his detonators.Very interesting to see Powell's trauma being resolved --- he swore to never draw his revolver ever.Michael Kamen's upbeat and tense score is unforgettable, in my book. I especially like the track -- during the scene where Hans hands Ellis the walky-talky. Listen closely and see if you get reminded of ""Singing in the Rain"" or Beethoven's ""Symphony no. 9"" as the movie goes on.Some of the best lines ever... e.g. ""After all you speeches, you're nothing but a common thief""... ""I am an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane and since I'm moving into kidnapping, you should be more polite""Grade A+10/10"
"Die Hard tells the story of a New York City detective named John McClane who is separated from his wife. She invites him to a Christmas party at her office building in Los Angeles, and he decides to go to work things out. Once there, a group of German terrorists come in and take hostages with the intent of stealing millions of dollars in bonds. McClane manages to escape and begins to fight the terrorists one by one to save the people in the building.Die Hard is a classic film because it completely revolutionized action films. The 80s were a time of unrealistic action sequences, predictable characters, and rudimentary plots. Die Hard changed all that. Die Hard takes place in a real world setting, or at least about as real as you can get with an action movie, so the action sequences, while insane, are slightly believable. The plot of the movie is simple, yet it's so brilliant at the same time. And the characters in this movie are engaging and a lot of fun to watch. John McClane is a really likable everyman kind of guy, we can all relate to him. Hans Gruber is an awesome villain, both cold and ruthless, yet very human. The supporting characters on the outside of the building are all great as well. Another great thing about Die Hard is that even though it's a hardcore action movie, it manages to be extremely funny at some parts, almost to a point of being able to call it a comedy. This makes the movie really easy to watch over and over again. There's really nothing wrong with this movie whatsoever in any department.The acting is great. Bruce Willis is hilarious and hardcore as John McClane, and he portrays the adrenaline and the frustration of the situation very well. Alan Rickman is awesome in one of his earlier roles as the main villain Hans Gruber. Reginald VelJohnson is enjoyable as McClane's outside contact Officer Al Powell, and Paul Gleason is funny as a hardheaded and incompetent deputy chief of police.Overall, Die Hard is the ultimate action film because it's fast, funny, and hardcore. It also gave us one of the most famous action movie one liners of all time...You know the one.8/10"
"Before the detractors of movie violence get the wrong idea,I'm not rating this film 10 stars in support of killing or guns or things like that. The rating is that for escapist entertainment,venting one's frustrations for the things that happen in the world,which we cannot do as much as we'd like about....this movie is absolutely great! This film owes a lot to movies like the ""Dirty Harry"" series and ""Bullitt"" with Steve McQueen. They are the true grand-daddies of the genre!A movie like Die Hard is meant to be the like the most dangerous of rides at an amusement park. Thrilling,unexpected,dangerous etc. This is not meant to be ""real"" because this is an action film,not a documentary on terrorism or police work. For non-stop action and just releasing pent up feelings of helplessness. I say more power to films like this. Only a very uneducated person would honestly believe that one person could knock out thugs like those in this movie (educated though they are).Not your kind of movie? Then it's simple find something that appeals to you. As far as the sequels go,#2 is just as action packed and suspenseful,#3 is still good but it does have the feeling of ""been there before"" but it does it's job and so does Bruce Willis. They only way to avoid getting tired of them,is to not watch them a lot. Then it seems fresh. (END)"
"This was a great start for Bruce Willis. This movie all started with John Mcclane on his Christmas vacation from New York to Los Angles to visit his wife Holly, which they were separated. John and Holly had an argument about their marriage. All of a sudden, while Holly was having a meeting, the German terrorist took over the plaza. The way how those terrorist planed their attack was incredible. All because of Theo, he know how to use computers and shutting off the elevators. And Karl played by Alexander Godunov, I had my eyes on him the way how he look suspicious with his long hair. Alan Rickman was the right actor to play as Hans Gruber, the way how he did that German ascent. As soon John accidentally killed Karl's brother during their fight all things broke lose with him, the part when Karl said "" I want blood"". The only part was so stupid was when Ellis trying to be a hero claiming to be John's friend. Ellis should of known that Hans was really going to kill him. I liked the way how John handled the terrorist situation as a New York cop. Reginald Veljohnson played as Sargent Al Powell stole the movie too. Such as, the way how Sargent Powell trusted John Mcclane, standing up for himself against Executive Chief Duane T. Robinson,including in the ending when held up his gun and shot down Karl. I also like the part when John and Hans finally met when Hans was acting like a hostage and claiming that he works for Neketomi. I think that was a challenging part for the director to put those two together. The best fight in Die Hard was John and Karl, I enjoyed that fight. All the lines in Die Hard were never broken by another movie. Such as, "" welcome to the party pal"". and "" I came by to the Christmas party by mistake who knew""."
"Bruce Willis stars as John McClane, a New York cop who flies out to Los Angeles to meet with his estranged wife at a Christms party in an LA Highrise that belongs to a wealthy company for which his wife works. Unknown to the guests, a group of terrorists headed by Alan Rickman takes everyone hostage, except McClane who manages to sneak by. Left with only his pistol, brains, and brawn McClane starts to give the bad guys hell.US action pictures were never the same after this film came out in 1988 and in watching it you can easily see why. Placed in one building over one night with one hero, who could have imagined such an exciting movie? Other 80s action films, while many of them are classics, never quite managed to accomplish what Die hard did so well. It is not the relentless action nor the characterization, but both of them combined. McClane is introduced like any other cop would be and not like some big guy who is obviously going to kick ass like say Schwarzenegger was shown in Commando. This film put a real human side to its hero - he's tough as nails, but not invincible. He relies on his brains and his brawn. He winces in pain, but pushes on. And of course he snaps wise-cracks and quotable lines: I mean who can truly forget ""yippy-kah-yay, motherf***er"" after seeing this movie even once?And it is not just the hero, but the villains he combats as well. They have their unlikable side and are obviously meant to be the bad guys, but they have their brains, their brawn, and of course their own weaknesses. Scripters Jeb Stuart and Steven de Souza must have gone about describing the villains pretty carefully in their screenplay and they have created a memorable bunch little army that is not your typical cardboard cut out set of villains. They range from a hacker who can't fight if his life depended on it to the mountainous assault rifle packing Karl who makes John McClane's day especially bad. Interestingly, Karl's seemingly endless fury isn't just an excuse to have a ""real tough ass"" bad guy, but it is characterized and introduced in of itself.Also, the music is very well developed. Beethoven's 9th is the backdrop for the score and it is interesting to see how it was put into the story in a both diagetic and a non-diagetic level. Added to that, they even put a Christmas twist to it.Finally, when you consider the fact that this one movie not only spawned an overall great trilogy, but a whole little sub-genre of ""Die Hard on a..."" makes this a great film all around. 10/10Rated R: violence and profanity"
"The eighties was the decade of the big blockbuster action flick - Lethal Weapon, Beverly Hills Cop, Cobra, Commando etc. But one film outdoes them all and this is it Die Hard, the action sequences are superb and set the standard for everyone to follow. The premise is a good one and while not exactly realistic it provides a firm base for some rocking action.Our main hero John McLaine (Bruce Willis) is well drawn and manages to avoid falling into the cliché trap of some action hero's, a sub-plot with his estranged wife is given just the right amount of time to provide depth without spoiling the pacing of the movie or feeling tacked on. The other main relationships in this movie is equally well played with the one good cop on the outside John forms a bond through humour and necessity and the interplay between them provides a nice counterpoint to give the audience a chance to draw it's breath.Also credit has to be given to Alan Rickman as Han Gruber for creating one of the best bad guys of any action flick, Rickman seems to have a nice line in bad guy persona's as he was easily the best thing in Robin Hood Prince of Thieves playing the sublimely evil Sheriff of Nottingham. But lets face it action is what we want here and boy those it provide it, bad guys are picked off left right and centre, a rooftop shoot out and one incredible explosion.If you love action movies and you haven't seen Die Hard get out there right now and get yourself a copy it'll be the best move you'll ever make.9/10"
"Sure he shoots people and blows things up, but there is only one moment in ""Die Hard"" where smooth criminal Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) loses his cool: When a woman realizes what he is up to, and tells him he is nothing but a ""common thief."" ""I am an exceptional thief,"" Hans says after vaulting a desk to get in her face. ""And since I'm moving up to kidnapping, you should be more polite.""""Die Hard"" likewise may be just an action film, but it is an exceptional action film, an entry in an already overcrowded field of cinematic bloodbaths that dared to be more than a little clever and insightful about the human condition even as it upped the ante on the on screen violence.Hans and his Euro-goons help matters considerably, by projecting real personality along with the menace. You understand their motivations, enjoy their humor, and still relish their comeuppance at the hands of a New York City cop played by Bruce Willis who finds himself alone against the bad guys in a Los Angeles skyscraper.Willis became a movie star from his performance here as John McClane, and it is very good. Willis projects his usual smugness, but manages to ingratiate himself to the audience early on in a key scene with his limo driver, Argyle, who presses him on what he's doing in L.A. if he's from New York. McClane says he's here to see his wife, who works here, and alludes to some trouble in their marriage, saying he couldn't also move to LA because of his responsibilities to the NYPD.Argyle won't let up. ""You mean you thought she'd come running back before you packed your bags,"" he laughs. McClane winces, but smiles. ""You're very quick, Argyle."" It's not a major moment, but it points up a key strength of this film. Everyone in it matters. Whether it's Argyle, McClane, Hans, a cop doing what is supposed to be a routine drive-by, a cokeheaded businessman, or a gunman with a sweettooth, the brilliant script by Jeb Stuart and Steven de Souza and deft direction by John McTiernan gives everyone a certain weight and presence that adds to the proceedings.For most of the film, McClane doesn't have Argyle to talk to, so he talks to the audience instead, in a series of monologues made believable by the pressure he is under (he seems to be in the habit of talking to himself anyway) that give McClane a humanity and humor unique for action films. ""Now I know what a TV dinner feels like,"" he says when crammed in a vent shaft. It's not that his one-liners are so clever, but that they come at the right times. Willis crafts a hero viewers can relate to, which makes his heroics more satisfying.The film also succeeds as a straightforward caper film, since the caper itself is intelligently designed and presented in such a way we sense we know where everyone of Hans' dozen underlings are at every given moment, even when the camera isn't on them. Also, the action scenes are incredibly well-done, grittier than anything else on screen at the time yet still entertaining.Okay, the picture is too glib at times, and shows Willis' hunkitude off more than I care to see. The phony business with the walkie-talkie chatter (you can't cut in on other people's transmissions the way everyone does here) is annoying, and the business with the TV reporter should have been left on the cutting room floor.But ""Die Hard"" is a film every bit as brilliant now as when it came out, influential, never equaled, and incredibly fun. Rickman is a great villain. And what can you say about a musical score that encompasses Vaughn Monroe, Run-DMC, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Christmas music? This is a film that leaves nothing out in its ambition to entertain, and succeeds wonderfully."
"If you have not seen Die Hard, not only is there something seriously wrong but you are also missing out on Bruce Willis looking his best!! You see Willis running around in, what can only be described as, a vest and bare feet. Alan Rickman puts on a fantastic performance as, German terrorist leader, Hans Gruber - Check out the accent! This is by far the best work by John McTeirnan who has seemed to have gone down hill since doing Die Hard Three but will hopefully bounce back with some more great directing. Die Hard is one of the best films that can be watched over and over again. Die Hard two and three don't quite compare to the original but are worth a look."
"Die HardI saw this movie a few years ago and never wrote a review on it. I've found the quintessence of action movies. This is the single greatest action movie I've ever seen. My usual formula follows.Plot: The plot is simple. A NYPD cop named John McClane goes to Los Angeles to visit his wife, Holly who works at Nakatomi Plaza. Later ""terrorists"" take over the building and John with his sidearm is forced to take them on. This movie has many twists and always keeps the pace moving.Acting: The acting in this movie is the best I've ever seen in an action movie. Bruce Willis stars as John McClane with a stunning performance. He shows stress, fear, bravado, and creates a fallible hero who makes mistakes and is vulnerable as well. Alan Rickman in his movie debut, gives the performance of his life as Hans Gruber. Creating the perfect action villain, he even surpasses Bruce Willis in my opinion. No one gave a bad performance in this movie, everyone played their part.Action: This movie is the pure quintessence of the action movie genre. This movie didn't create the action genre, but it evolved it. It made a new kind of hero who was fallible, made mistakes, and was more human. It also made a new kind of villain in the form of Hans Gruber. He was a villain who liked to let his goons do the dirty work for him most of the time but at times did it himself.Although this movie has mistakes that we notice easily, we must remember every movie has those. It should not break your praise of the movie. This is a movie I define as a masterpiece of movies. A masterpiece of the genre is something that mostly only the fans of the genre will like and a few outside. A masterpiece of movies is a movie that even people who don't generally like the genre will like.So I say if you love action movies and haven't seen this yet, what are you waiting for get this now. If you don't like action movies that much then still see it. I say that for every 10 people who see it at least 8 to 9 people will love it.10/10"
"There has been a barrage of big, dumb action movies since people could afford to blow stuff up for cinematic purposes. Two things these movies tend to lack are a well structured plot and good character development.In 1988, Die Hard came out. Bruce Willis, who beforehand only had Blind Date and Moonlighting to his credit, was cast as the main character, John McClane. The thing that separated McClane from any other action heroes at the time is that McClane is an average joe. He's not a robot, he's not a martial arts expert. He's just a guy, vulnerable, bitter about his failing marriage, a wiseass.While visiting his wife Holly for a Christmas party at her office building, a band of well-armed ""terrorists"" seize control, locking all the exits and securing all the hostages. All except McClane. Armed with only his police issued pistol and lacking a pair of shoes, he engages in a game of cat and mouse with terrorist leader, Hans Gruber, a methodical, precise, and patient villain. The supporting characters are also great; Ellis, Holly's annoying, coked-out coworker. Powell, McClane's lifeline and only friend on the outside. Dwayne, the powertripping deputy who second-guesses McClane along the way. The incompetent F.B.I. agents. Love or hate them, the supporting characters are all rich with personality.Die Hard was groundbreaking at the time, and twenty years later, it still holds up as a timeless classic where other action movies have dated themselves with poor special-effects and non-existent story lines."
"One of greatest action films ever produced, with a case to be made for the the absolute pinnacle. Everybody knows what's right with it -- self-contained setting, ever-escalating stakes, fantastic hero & villain, tons of interesting characters on all sides, SFX that hold up nearly 30 years later - - so here's just a couple things that might challenge its claim to #1 Action Film trophy: Too many unbelievably stupid characters challenge suspension of disbelief, and the 80s hair and fashion date it just a trifle. But even the former are good for a few laughs, and the latter is a very minor complaint.Otherwise, ""Die Hard"" is pretty much flawless. Bruce Willis, John McTiernan, Alan Rickman -- their finest hour (maybe you could make a case for Rickman's loftier work, but he's dead solid perfect here). A movie I have seen more than any other but for ""Casablanca."""
"This is without a doubt, 'thee' action film. It is what all good action film should live up to.The story is nothing special, one building, 20 or so terrorists and one bad assed vest wearing Bruce Willis. Its basically Bruce vs. the bad guys. And he does it with style, and many twists along the way.The action shots are pure class, with Bruce cracking off one liners after taking out the bad guys. His struggle to remain undetected and conserve ammo is one that you feel genuinely drawn into.Alan Rickman is also superbly cast as the villain, giving a great performance as Hans Gruber. But at the end of the day, you've got to give this film to Bruce Willis, one of the greatest action stars.10/10"
"Die hard is one of the best action films of the 80s ! Its tagline of ""Suspense, Excitement, Adventure, On every level!"" was probably the most fitting ever and it single handedly spawned the whole lone-guy-trapped-in-an-enclosed-place-and-surrounded-by terrorists action sub-genre that we wouldn't have speed, underseige , or to a lesser extent high risk without !Bruce willis is at his best as gun toting every man john mcclane and alan rickman just about steals the show as uber terrorist hans grueber. In addition to the great performances , there is , of course, tons of spine tingling suspense and all guns blazing action.Its a classic of the genre and makes you weary of Christmas parties in big buildings......"
"DIE HARD (1988) **** Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, Bonnie Bedelia, Alexander Godunov, Reginald Vel Johnson, William Atherton, Paul Gleason, Hart Bochner, Robert Davi.  NYC cop John McClane (Willis in his star-making iconic role) is visiting LA at Christmas to reconnect with his estranged wife Bedelia who is at an office party that becomes a nightmare when a group of terrorists take over the building led by Hans Gruber (perfect Rickman) a German nutjob out to filch millions in bonds in the vault of the Japanese company.  As the "" fly in the ointment"", Willis does his damnedest to stop him at all costs relying on his street-smarts and out-guessing as time ticks away.  Great blend of action suspense and much welcomed humor.   Best bit: Willis plunging from a rooftop attack by the FBI (thinking the disheveled cop is one of the bad guys!) attached to a fire hose and shooting his way into an empty office!  Hair-raising and exhilirating fun for all. ""Yippiee-Kay-Ay !!!!"" (Dir: John McTiernan)"
"Easily the best Die Hard movie and a rare victory in this genre for the director and producers. I sat down and cheered Bruce on through this movie which is as rare as Michael Jordan being humble. This is the time of year to whack ""Die Hard"" in the old DVD, and listen to the sweet ""Jingle Bell Rock"" tune."
"Bruce Willis stars as THE most bad-ass cop in film history even as of today: John McClane. The wise-cracking, tough-as-nails cop who's always sarcastically funny and never fears to get his hands dirty. This man is no Rambo though; he does not plan, relying solely on instinct and last-minute thinking, which although nearly got him killed quite a number of times, seemed to have worked well enough.The plot was simple enough yet intriguing. McClane is pitted against 12 terrorists in a building, with no help from anywhere, in a battle of wits and grit against their leader, the diabolical Hans Gruber, excellently portrayed by Alan Rickman.Die Hard is a remarkable success on every level; the jokes were funny, the gunfights were gory and we have two individuals consistently taunting each other to keep the temperatures rising. In my humble opinion, this was the herald of the transition of action movies moving into the 90s.Yippee Ki-yay, mother*beep*."
"Nearly twenty years and millions of clichés later, the original Die Hard still holds up in all of it's Hollywood glory. One of the last films to come out of that greater era of quality popcorn entertainment (compared to today's standards), this fluidly visceral, though lighthearted study into the hostage tensions overtaking 40-story Nakatomi plaza has become a modern day action classic for all the right reasons.Sure some characters have devolved into caricature upon recent viewings (Hart Bochner's coked up Ellis), sure the entire mechanics informing this intense ordeal feel a little less gripping in retrospect, and sure an excess of one-liners can degrade the entire process on the whole...but not by a whole lot. Die Hard was perfectly calibrated to be as entertaining as it was bloody, adult, and exciting when it arrived. While time may have extracted a percentage of the urgency out of this eternally exciting experience, conceptually the original Die Hard will continue to remain one of the most captivating settings ever staged in a modern action film. The selfless direction from John McTiernan was hitting it's stride as he captured progressively intense battles in a simultaneously spacious and claustrophobic setting.It is the triumphant locale which hosts this intelligent robbery thriller that will continue to beckon re-visitation, though without the considerable tension between our two leads, Nakatomi skyscraper would remain an empty gesture. Bruce Willis could not have asked for a better early career move then to star as New York cop John McClane. Even if it did pigeon-hole his limited talent, Willis already displayed the raw intuition that made him one of our most agreeable action stars. His everyman style was one of instant cult likability: a person most average joe's could relate to, thrust into a situation no one could relate to. His line deliveries will pale to the actor who has slightly but surely refined his craft over many years, but the finesse with which he eases into the action with believability and likability became instantly recognizable."
"a truly awesome action movie which should provide the outline for all Acton movies. surely no one dislikes this film? Surely? Well done Mr Mclaine for giving me many happy times pretending to be a kick ass cop as a kid while blowing away imaginary terrorists with my home made machine gun. Also nice visual effects for its time including the ""brains on the window"" scene. Fair enough the story line is not so original but who cares when an action film is this entertaining and that many people are killed in one night, inside one building by one man. I don't dislike the other two but think it was too much to ask to create two more genius films like this one!"
"Die Hard, one of the greatest action movies of all time, still to this day, it's more impressive than ever. If you were to look in the dictionary and look up the word action, this movie would probably be shown, lol. My mom was just absolutely in love with this film and told me how much I should see it if I love action movies, also I had become a Bruce Willis fan, so when she mentioned that, I decided to sit down and watch it. It's not just Bruce Willis that makes this movie, although he does a fantastic job as the ultimate hero, his line delivery is always perfectly on cue and he's just such a cool guy that anyone could love. But for me it was Alan Rickman who truly steals the film, he is the ultimate bad guy and his voice was just so creepy, I love him. But all together the cast and special effects truly make this a memorable film for generations to come.John McClane is a police officer who has taken his career very seriously, a little too seriously since his wife is about to divorce him and he's about to loose his children. When John comes to see his wife, Holly, at her office building during the company Christmas party, he asks if he can be given a second chance, but that gets slightly interrupted when terrorists enter the building. Hans Gruber, the leader of the terrorists, wants 600 million dollars of bonds from the company's owner. But with John in the building, he's gonna have a hard time because John is on his case will make sure to give him a roller coaster of a crime bust.This is without a doubt the most exciting action movie since The Terminator. I love the whole idea of this taking place around Christmas, it just adds a little more dark humor. Especially the way that Alan Rickman says ""Now I have a machine gun. Ho...Ho...Ho"", it was just so perfect! I really love Die Hard, I am officially a fan, this is just the most awesome movie to watch. Believe me, it's that good, I highly recommend this movie for anyone, it's a lot of fun, I guarantee you that you will not be disappointed.10/10"
"Great movie, watched because of Brooklyn 99. Thouroughly enjoyed every moment."
"My Rating : 8/10Go watch Die Hard if you haven't already. This is out and out action at its finest.Bruce Willis is perfect and everything just works.Not much to elaborate, its a perfectly done action movie."
"This is how an action flick should be done! And this just happened to be the flick that propelled Bruce Willis' career.As one reviewer put it, these are three key points that every action film should have:1. A sense of realism (meaning: the hero is only human and can get hurt)2. Grit (messy, unpolished action, dirty people and LOTS of swearing)3. R-rated violence (showing the audience what real weapons do to the human body)This film had it all, and the outstanding performance by Willis was perfect.A little fun fact for all you Willis fans: he was a bartender in NYC and gave a ride to a friend to an audition. While waiting for their audition to end, he got spotted and asked to audition - and got the part! The rest is history!A perfect 10/10 from me!"
"On Christmas Eve, New York City Police Detective John McClane arrives in Los Angeles. He aims to reconcile with his estranged wife, Holly, at the Christmas party of her employer, the fictional Nakatomi corporation. McClane is driven to the party by Argyle, an airport limousine driver. While McClane changes clothes, the party is disrupted by the arrival of Hans Gruber and his heavily armed terrorists: Karl, Franco, Tony, Theo, Alexander, Marco, Kristoff, Eddie, Uli, Heinrich, Fritz, and James. The group seizes the tower and secures those inside as hostages, except for McClane, who manages to slip away.Gruber singles out Nakatomi executive Joseph Takagi, and says he intends to teach the corporation a lesson for its greed. Away from the hostages, Gruber interrogates Takagi for the code to the building's vault. Gruber admits that they are using terrorism as a distraction while they attempt to steal $640 million in bearer bonds in the vault. Takagi refuses to cooperate and is murdered by Gruber. McClane, who has been secretly watching, accidentally gives himself away and is pursued by Tony. McClane manages to kill Tony, taking his weapon and radio, which he uses to contact the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). Sgt. Al Powell is sent to investigate. Gruber sends Heinrich and Marco to stop McClane, who kills them both. Powell, having been greeted by Eddie, who poses as a concierge, finds nothing strange about the building. As Powell turns to leave, McClane drops Marco's corpse onto his patrol car. After being fired upon by the terrorists, Powell summons the LAPD who surround the building. McClane takes Heinrich's bag containing C-4 explosives and detonators."
"'Die Hard' is without a doubt the pinnacle of classic action films and a highlight of the 80s. There's only one name that terrorist fear; McClane!1. In a time when a new action star was needed, a young Bruce Willis rose to the challenge amidst the likes of Schwarzenegger and Stallone. Reluctantly on a trip to Los Angeles to meet his estranged wife (Bonnie Bedelia) and kids, John McClane (Bruce Willis) finds himself under the radar of a terrorist plot on Christmas Eve. Willis really was a breath of fresh air at the time of this film's release, considering no one knew what to expect since action stars of that era were damn near body-building types.2. As far as Willis is concerned, with every great hero...there must be a great villain to follow; enter Alan Rickman (Hans Gruber). Apart from '007' films, Rickman defined what a suave, intelligent and deadly antagonist can be. No matter how bad a villain is, it's equally fun to have a formidable henchman at his side, which (the late) Alexander Godunov (Karl) portrays with sheer brutality. However sad it was to hear of Rickman's passing, his legacy still lives on in his most memorable and career defining role as Hans Gruber.3. Behind a great action-flick like this, stood an exceptional director. John McTiernan proved his worth in the realm of action the previous year when he directed another cult and sci-fi classic; 'Predator'. It was clearly a no-brainer having him on board and in turn, McTiernan also went on to direct the third film in the franchise: 'Die Hard: With a Vengeance'. His directing style is obvious as can be since the action sequences are well maintained so that things never get derailed or too crazy.4. Reginald Vel Johnson and Paul Gleason round out the main cast, with memorable side characters as well that stand in as other terrorists and comic reliefs respectively. Willis himself adds more of the humor to the film when he finds himself in stressful situations as the film progresses. He just has a natural charm as McClane which no other action star has ever brought to a character before.To find things that don't work about this film is a hard task, cause I honestly can't think of anything. When spectacle meets action, that's when you'll know that old habits DIE HARD!!!"
"This is by far the best Christmas film that has ever been made. Classic 80's action film with smoking drink and drug taking watching the film just feels so well 80's.Great Performances from Alan Rickman as his first role he really made the film for me. being the master mind behind the heist and using the FBI play book to aid his Heist is very cleaver. Bruce Willis plays your standard off duty cop, that goes to see his wife and kids.He ends up getting caught in the middle of heist, but with his wife life hanging in the balance he finds the courage will and determination to save not only her life but all of the hostages."
"It's very rare to come across an action movie that doesn't use the formula that die hard created or to come across an action movie that's as good as die hard. I'd like to thank director John McTiernan and screenwriters Jeb Stuart and Steven E de Souza for giving us the perfect 80's action film. Die hard is based on a novel called ""Nothing Lasts Forever"" by Roderick Thorp.Bruce Willis plays John McClane a new York cop going to Los Angeles for Christmas to see his wife, Holly. During a Christmas party at the nakatomi plaza, a group of German terrorists led by Hans Gruber played by Alan Rickman take hostages and McClane is the only one that can stop them.The performances in this movie are great. Bruce Willis as John McClane is perfect. He is a very believable police officer. Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber steals every scene he's in. He is one of, if not the greatest action movie villain of all time. Holly Gennaro McClane is played by Bonnie Bedelia and she's very good in the film. Reginald VelJohnson plays Sgt. AL Powell, an LAPD officer who communicates with McClane through the use of a radio. He's great character with a great ark. Paul Gleason is Deputy Police Chief Dwayne T. Robinson and he's quite good as well. William Atherton plays a news reporter named Richard Thornburg who's a total tool. Hart Bochner plays Ellis. He's great in the movie. James Shigeta is Mr Takagi the owner of the nakatomi plaza. Karl is played by Alexander Godunov, who's very good. The limo driver named Argyle is played by De'voreaux White. He's a great supporting character.This movie is perfect in every way possible, the acting, the directing, the amazing action, the cinematography by Jan de Bont, the dialogue, the setting, the editing, and the soundtrack are all perfect. This is one of the greatest movies ever made."
"This original action classic has been hugely influential over the years - and it's no surprise, as it's one of the best action thrillers ever made. New meaning is brought to the word ""action"" as here it is exhilarating, furious and nothing less than exciting. The premise is simple: one location, one good guy and twelve bad guys. Cue lots of explosions, fist fights, blood, violence, and plenty of shooting too. The thrills come from the suspense of Willis using his wits as well as his brawn to fight the bad guys and save the hostages.When watching this film what becomes immediately apparent is how fresh it is. This hasn't been filmed with some cheap cameras for a quick buck, it looks professional and couldn't be less polished. The photography is clear and brings out the best of the surroundings, while the music has obviously been carefully chosen to convey the right mood. And, strangely enough for an action film, the acting is actually very good. Unheard of, as remember this was back in the days where Schwarzenegger and Stallone were the top stars of the action genre. Bruce Willis excels as the wisecracking, sardonic cop, and you can't fail to like him. He's consistently witty and provides a powerful presence when needed - it comes as no surprise as he lived off this image for the next six or seven years.The supporting cast aren't half bad, either. The reliable Bonnie Bedelia takes a break from her usual highbrow, ""moral dilemma"", television movie fare as Willis' tough wife, while Reginald Veljohnson is also great as a sympathetic cop - you just want to hug him. But most memorable of all is Alan Rickman for his excellent turn as the cool, calculating terrorist with a carefully-crafted German accent and a fine line in natty suits. Rickman is THE bad guy of modern cinema, watch any subsequent action film with terrorists and you'll see people trying to be him. He's that good. The rest of the cast of terrorists have all been picked for their imposing looks, and they're not bad either. Keep your eyes peeled for fearsome Bond baddie Robert Davi in a minor role as an FBI man.As well as the tense running around in corridors and stand-offs between Willis and the various creeps, this film really delivers in the action stakes. The guys here really do look like they are trying their hardest to kill each other, and we get people flying down stairs, getting chains wrapped around their necks, getting shot all over the place. Every kill that Willis makes is original and exciting. There are also plenty of ace stunts, like when Willis jumps off an exploding roof with only a fire hose tied around his waist. The gore level is high, graphic in fact, with people being shot apart wherever you look, and it's definitely a film for all cinema fans to enjoy. Consistently entertaining and strong enough to withstand repeated viewings, this is the first and final word on the ""one guy versus lots of bad guys"" sub-genre of the action flick."
"In stepped John McTiernan and Bruce Willis with Die Hard. Willis, most famous at the time for the comic TV Series 'Moonlighting', made a perfect ordinary-man-in-an-extraordinary-situation action hero. He was believable as John McClane and not immune to being hurt. He bled and felt pain, a first for the genre. And yet his cool confident delivery of a great wisecracking, intelligent script made him all the cooler. But most credit should go to Director John McTiernan, king of the sophisticated action flick. He made action movies slick, smart and full of pace and wit while never letting up on the bullets, cars and bombs front. Special praise must go out to Alan Rickman too whose performance as chief baddie Hans is to this day one of cinemas finest, moving convincingly from cool, calm and collected to desperate and nervous, never once seeming anything less than utterly ruthless and calculating. Even after we discover that Hans isn't there as a political terrorist but simply as a thief, he loses absolutely no villain credibility when he responds to Holly McClane's criticism by saying ""I am an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane and since I'm moving to kidnapping you should be more polite."" Although we know Hans is capable of vile acts, he actually sees those as merely means to a greater and somehow justifiable end. His disposition is almost humanitarian and you would imagine him as quite a gentleman outside of the context of the crimes he commits in Die Hard's arc. In the end though, Hans is a pure sociopath that even the audience is conned into sympathizing with. I would actually argue that Die Hard is the greatest pure action film ever made. Yippie-ki-yay *muddy funster*... and happy holidays.Overall rating: 9 out of 10."
