"Sound like a bold statement? Devotees of classic cops and robbers flicks of old will no doubt take exception, but I believe that Michael Mann achieved some measure of perfection with Heat. To break this three-hour gem of a film down to its core, this is a film about men - strong men - and the supporting role that he women of the film have on them for better or worse. Take Pacino as good cop Vincent Hanna: one of the most intense characterizations of the tragic hero that I have ever witnessed, as he laments the demise of his third marriage to a pill-junkie wife. A fact which he discusses with his archnemesis (De Niro) in what history will regard as one of the most frenetic scenes in the history of film. The dialogue in this scene (at the very end of the first tape, if you own the VHS version) sets up the last half of the film beautifully, as our two rivals come to the joint realization that they have no hand in choosing the paths that will lead them to their ultimate confrontation: their very natures so define their respective actions that any attempt to do otherwise would simply be a waste of time. While I have heard others (who I am ashamed at times to call close friends) say that Heat drags in places, I will concede that there are moments in the film that require more than the cursory attention that they give to the movie they happen to be watching at any given time (I'm sorry not every director is Jerry Bruckheimer), there are poignant developments of character in Heat that many would casually disregard. I am thinking of the interaction between the ex-con who finds conditional employment in a diner with an opportunistic scum of a boss, and whose girlfriend is so proud of him for swallowing his pride and not simply giving the sonofabitch a good pummeling. But there is a catharsis that I felt for that same ex-con when De Niro's character presents him with the opportunity to take just one more score, for old time's sake. Who doesn't feel for this guy - this minor character in a film with big-time heavyweights who gets to shine for a few brief moments. That's what Heat is really: a series of brief moments, some touching, others traumatic, and still others incredibly horrifying in the feelings that they inspire in the romantic who, like me sees not black or white portrayals of protagonist and villain, but a montage of grays that combine to create a vivid spectrum of film characterization that could not be found in hundreds of films combined. One of my five favorite films of all time, Heat is a cinematic banquet of intense imagery and pulse-pounding action. Come hungry."
"One of the most amazing things about Heat is the scale of the film; it is nearly three hours long and packed to bursting with mind-blowing visuals. It seems one of Michael Mann's main priorities was to make a film with a dreamlike feel to it, to portray LA as a dusty oil-painting on which complex characters could play out their lives. One of the main themes is the similarity of the career criminal and the street-wise cop. It is fascinating to find yourself really feeling for DeNiro's tragic bank-robber, a man of philosophical merit who realises he's stuck in a life of crime he doesn't want to lead. Pacino's cop is less easy to sympathise with, but he too leads an in-escapable life of guns and crime. What really stands out is the climax. On the whole, Heat has to be the best cops n' robbers film ever made, indeed, one of the best films. An epic, wonderful, sad, adrenaline-fuelled exercise in scale and grandeur."
"For some reason I cannot stop thinking about this film lately.You know that feeling of having seen it about 3 or 4 times in the last 12 months is not enough? That's what I feel at the moment.I rate it as Mann's best. It's his most kinetic,vibrant(for a film mostly shot in steely blue),agonising,stirring,brash,violent and brilliance in such a simple story. What games did you play as a young kid? Cops and robbers.Good guy.Bad guy.We all know De Niro and Pacino could have been either main part,but can you imagine it any other way round. Pacino doing ice cool calm? De Niro the manic outbursts,arms flailing? It wouldn't work. We know these men now.We know neither will stop at what they do.And yet there is no way either would stop the other.Unless they had too. Which leads us too the characters. All of them.This is an extended family where you feel you know all of them without knowing anything at all. The cops are similar to the robbers and vice-versa. Perhaps Mann is telling us were all the same.Except in what we do.Every speaking part holds substance in this movie, and the support cast is astonishing when you actually read the caliber of who appeared in this film.Tom Sizmore, Val Kilmer,Ashley Judd,Ted Levine,Wes Studi,Hank Azaria,William Fitchner,Henry Rollins,Dennis Haysbert,Tom Noonan. And Natalie Portman, for chrissake! Try getting that cast again.A real 10/10 film. And that Moby song at the end(God moving over the face of waters) gets me every time."
"A masterpiece and one of the best action heist movies of all time! Heat (1995) is one of my personal favorite Al Pacino and Robert De Niro Action heist movie of all time! I love this movie to death! This movie has everything, action, drama, heist, great cast and incredible realistic great performance from Al Pacino and Robert De Niro! Provides fast and loose action with interesting characters. Great action movie!!!! One of the best for me!!!!!!!!! To this day this movie stands a classic action heist movie of all time! Acting, story, score everything in here is excellent! This movie has a great plot, brilliant story about two lead characters a professional master thief Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) battling Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) LAPD robbery-homicide detective in this non-stop race against time heist. Michael Mann did everything with this film, he wrote the screenplay, produced this movie and directed it. Michael Mann is a brilliant director I love Miami Vice TV Series, Manhunter and Collateral. This movie is the real heist movie un like Point Break and Baby Driver this movie deserves a 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors and great stunts. Without the vision, this film would be nothing. Without the tools, this film would be nothing.Al Pacino stars in the film as Vincent Hanna, a relentless lieutenant in the LAPD's Robbery Homicide Division who is determined to take down a high end robbery crew led by master thief Neil McCauley (De Niro). Notable for its detailed depiction of the techniques used by both law enforcement and criminal elements, as well as exceptional and accurate gun handling, the film was first made as the 1989 television movie L.A. Takedown. Heat also was reported to have been viewed repeatedly by the ""High Incident Bandits"" robbery duo involved in the infamous North Hollywood shootout (as depicted in the film 44 Minutes: The North Hollywood Shootout). Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) LAPD robbery-homicide detective was a great character cop. He was at least MILES way better than Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves) FBI rookie Agent in Point Break that movie sucked! Lt. Vincent Hanna shoot and killed Michael Cheritto (Tom Sizemore) and he saved a child. He cracked the case and he figure it out who the mask robbers were. In the climatic epic battle fight on the end of the film on the airport field he shoot and killed Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro). He destroyed and hunt down McCauley's crew. True two got away but he always got his man. He at least didn't let go McCauley like Johnny Utah did, letting go Bodhi (Patrick Swayze) and he did not arrest or shoot or kill any of Bodhi's men he let them all go. Lt. Vincent Hanna is a hero and veteran police officer to me. Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro), as a professional thief was smart, intelligent, high profile criminal with no criminal record. He was the mastermind behind the robberies, he knew what he was doing. He was a murderer and he did what he know best. He at least wasn't like stupid dumb idiot Bodhi from Point Break, he was trying to get away but he always settle a score with everyone that double crossed him. It is wrong to messing with him. By the end that way leaded him to his end, he made a mistake when he went after Waingro (Kevin Gage). The movie has also one of the greatest shootouts in L.A. in which Shiherlis (Val Kilmer), Cheritto (Tom Sizemore) McCauley (Robert De Niro) firing Colt Model 733 automatic riffle on the cops. Great shootout's I love it. The movie has great famous cast: Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore, Ashley Judd, Mykelti Williamson, Ted Levine, Dennis Haysbert, William Fichtner, Natalie Portman, Tom Noonan, Kevin Gage, Danny Trejo, Hank Azaria, Martin Ferrero and Xander Berkeley a lot of famous actors and actresses were extra in this movie. The movie focus on a real human characters that they are ordinary people with normal life's like you and me. That is why I love this film to death! It is realistic performed and it has no jokes or fantasy or anything it is real life. I love Al Pacino and Robert De Niro's performance they both fit the task and accomplish their acting their characters. Heat is the 1995 crime drama directed by Michael Mann and marked the first on screen pairing of legendary actors Al Pacino and Robert De Niro.10/10 My all time personal favorite action heist masterpiece Michael Mann film of all time, this movie kicks ass."
"'Heat,' a film of epic proportions on a common placed scale, provides all the essentials of a great crime drama and then some.  With a fascinating storyline, involving characters, and Mann's sometimes poetic, sometimes gritty directing, 'Heat' is arguably one of the best crime dramas.Perhaps the most unique feature of this movie is its manifold storyline, which focuses primarily on the main characters: Vincent Hanna and Neil McCauley.  Because of this complex storyline, it almost seems as if one is watching two movies, with one about each of the two characters.  While following Hanna's personal life, the movie shows how it is about more than just a cop in pursuit of a criminal.  Hanna's marriage is deteriorating, his step daughter is falling apart, and, as wife Justine says, he lives his life more among the ""remnants of dead people.""  A man of two other failed marriages, Hanna's story is that of the strain of trying to fulfill both his professional and personal, where, every time, the professional wins out. Neil McCauley's story is that of a man who used to know his role: his job. Everything in his life revolved around making the next score (whether it be large or small).  His story chronicles his relationships with the other men in his crew, and his relationship with Eady, his girlfriend who does not know all she should about him.  The tensions build as Mann shows the two opposing strategies of each man as their paths (and thus their stories) draw closer together.  When the two storylines do meet (at different points in the movie), the result is--for lack of a better word--epic.  To say that these two major storylines are the only strong ones of the movie would do injustice to the many others (following Chris and his wife, for example); but to say that they are the driving force of the movie, to say that they are responsible for transforming a typical cops-and-robbers story is the best explanation.In addition, the characters in this movie undoubtedly make it so successful. This cast comes as close as possible to being ensemble with two such huge main characters.  And the cast is one of the best, at that.  DeNiro. Little more needs to be said.  Ever the master, his character, McCauley, can be on the one hand a ruthless robber and cold-hearted killer, on the other a warm friend and tender lover.  And, despite his life of crime, McCauley's human side shows through.  He will not kill unless he must, as seen through his anger at Waingro and bank heist.  His warmer side shows through his relationships with his friends and girlfriend Eady.  Pacino.  Equally without need of praise.  As always, he delivers an intense performance, here as Hanna, a workaholic obsessed with catching his man, while also fighting a losing battle to save his personal relationships.  He may seem just the harsh cop, but he cares about every man under his command, about his stepdaughter, and, yes, even about McCauley.  Through Hanna, Pacino shows just how torn such a man can be.  Hanna demonstrates both coldness and compassion, both anger and sensitivity.  Additionally strong is Val Kilmer, as Chris Shiherlis; with a raging temper, undying devotion, and a fierce will to persevere.  Kilmer does an excellent job with the character of a flawed individual, whose flaws prevent him from lasting contentment, but against which flaws he continually strives.  Ashley Judd is an unforgettable Charlene Shiherlis, who, despite a smaller roll, makes a lasting impression on the film.  Tom Sizemore, as the implacable Michael Cheritto, and Jon Voight, as a gruff Nate, are both likeable (because of their human sides) and despicable (because of their professions).  Each does excellent work. And equally fine are Diane Venora, as Justine, and Natalie Portman, as Justine's daughter Lauren.  As Venora is strong opposite Pacino, so Amy Brenneman, Eady, is an equally strong opposite of DeNiro.  In a cast so full of big names, it is so rewarding to see everyone come together to make the characters each have their own place in the film.And Michael Mann's direction of the movie keeps the film moving while providing a tremendous combination of action and drama.  He moves from scene to scene quickly and effortlessly.  He also switches between the many storylines logically and fluidly, none of the story being lost.  Each scene leaves its own, unmistakable impression, and each scene of each storyline builds upon the previous.  Action scenes are handles crisply but grittily. The gunshots are loud, the blood is abundant, but Mann wisely does not linger on the horror of the moment.  He paints a realistic picture, but keeps to the topic.  The action never becomes more important than the drama. Mann is also responsible for what is perhaps the greatest robbery scene ever.  Here, his more gritty sense of style is what makes this scene so believable.  And, despite the enormous cast, Mann was still able to keep his agenda clear, and orchestrate so much talent into a coherent movie. Michael Mann deserves credit for both his vision and ability to express it.Because of these and other well done aspects, 'Heat' is one of the most powerful crime dramas ever made."
"I am always wary of films boasting of star-studded casts and big-name, behind-the-camera talent. So, I approached ""Heat"" with some trepidation...of course, I'm a big fan of DeNiro and Pacino (even as he has declined into one-note, manic performances in the 90's) and I feel that Michael Mann is one of the most underrated directors in Tinseltown (one need only view ""Manhunter"" to view his genius in pacing a crime thriller). Given the incredible supporting cast, this production set high standards for itself. I must report that it did not disappoint. Given that the running time is almost three hours and Mann has the task of balancing two significant storylines (DeNiro's and Pacino's), the film is a stunningly linear examination of life on both sides of the law. The viewer sees sacrifices made and relationships lost in both arenas without the usual emotional push to root for one side against the other. The visceral thrill of watching Pacino and DeNiro emote together was one of the film's marketing points; though they have two brief scenes together, it is a unique thrill to see these two modern icons of cinema play off one another. While it is clear that either of these two has the star power to carry a film singlehandedly, the experience of watching the cop and robber suffer through their diametrically opposed, yet parallel lives is fascinating. I'm sure that fans of the films will remember, in the years to come, the diner scene between the two as fondly as some hold the pairing of Randolph Scott and Joel McCrea in ""Ride The High Country"".Those who criticized the film at the time of its release found particular fault with the climax. They cynically deemed the clasping of hands between the two opponents as a overly sentimental gesture. While it is sentimental, the scene is a neat capsulation of their relationship, however unexplored, throughout the film. They have acted as the hunter and his prey; yet, they finally realize that they are kindred spirits - dedicated men who put their chosen profession above all else in their lives. They are aware of the opportunities for ""normalcy"" they have sacrificed for their obsessions (I love DeNiro's line in the diner on what's normal) and hold each other in high regard because they share the same pain and isolation. I think ""Heat"" has a beautiful ending, enhanced by Moby's elegiac ""God Moving Over The Face Of The Waters""I don't put much stock in the Academy Awards in terms of evaluating a film's worth, but it was a true disgrace that ""Braveheart"" was chosen Best Picture in 1995. ""Heat"" was not even nominated! Hopefully, the Academy voters will right this error with Mann's equally powerful ""Insider"" at this year's ceremonies.Don't be scared off by ""Heat""'s running time or by criticism that its too indulgent in its character studies. It is precisely the film's attention to developing its characters that sets it apart from every other by-the-numbers Hollywood crime film of this era and makes ""Heat"" a classic."
"I really believe this is one the great crime movies of all time. It has some drawbacks that wouldn't make me recommend this for family viewing - tons of f- words by Al Pacino and a few bloody scenes, but as far as a fascinating crime story: wow!This movie made modern-day history because it was the first time two of the great actors of this generation - Pacino and Robert De Niro - finally acted together in the same film. Those two didn't disappoint, either. They were great to watch and one of the huge highlights of the film, to me, was when they faced each other in a simple conversation over a cup of coffee. That conversation has always fascinated me, no matter how many times I've heard it. It was such a ""landmark"" scene that It's even the subject of a short documentary on the special-edition DVD.As with the conversation scene, the shootout segment in the streets of Los Angeles still astounds me no matter how many times I see it. The other action scenes are intense and memorable, too, and the cast in here is deep. This isn't just Pacino and De Niro. It's Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, Jon Voight, Diana Venora, Natlie Portman, Tom Sizemore, Amy Brenamann, Wes Studi, Ted Levine, Mykelti Williamson, on and on. Put that fabulous cast under Michael Mann, one of the best directors in business, add a great soundtrack and interesting camera-work and you have a great film. At three hours long, it never bores one and at same time, doesn't overdo the action, either. I read one critic criticize this film because of the time taken to examine the personal lives of the main characters, but you can't have three hours of nothing but action. The only scene I felt went on a bit too long was the ending chase at the airport, but that's nitpicking considering the film as a whole.This is just one of those movies where a great cast and director live up to their billing."
"In this exciting thrill ride, good and evil battle it out.  But not in the usual comic-book style of most films today.  ""Heat"" carries with it the moral values so many of us take for granted.  Although much in the film is morally ambiguous, one may find that even when all your life you've lived on the other side of the law, you can still settle down and have a heart-to-heart.  When I first saw this movie I was sure it would be another violent crime movie that I would never want to see again.  I have since seen it 4 times and have a copy of my own.  The thrilling sequences and brilliant camera-work have you glued to the screen.  The exceptional cast of characters has you wondering ""who could be so lucky to work with them?"". From the opening scene to the thrilling final scenes and everything in between (including the climax) ""Heat"" grabs you and pulls you in.  This is a true film masterpiece."
"Most of the comments I've read here agree that this is a great movie. I have the same opinion. The coffee shop scene tells everything about this film: 10/10. The human side of the characters is perfectly explored, especially concerning De Niro's character (Neil). His personal conflicts are as strong as his determination and skills as a gangster. This is the magic of this film and only two fantastic actors like Pacino and De Niro could represent it so totally. Congratulations to Val Kilmer that shined and performed exceptionally well under the huge shadow of Pacino and De Niro. A must see !"
"Heat is a masterful cops and robbers tale that shows both sides of the law in exquisite detail.  Strong performances by Pacino and DeNiro (the scene of them sitting across the table from each other is possibly 5 of the most memorable minutes in film history).  Excellent cinematography and perhaps the best gunfight (if not, one of the most intense) since Hard Boiled. More than worth the 3 or so hours."
"I am assuming I am commenting on this film for those who have not seen this film and for those people I pity you. Its a crime thriller. Won't describe the story as its not particularly original and not the best thing about this film. You've got Pacino and Deniro on screen in a film for the first and possibly last time which should be recommendation enough. You've also got director Michael Mann at the top of his game. An awesome supporting cast firing on all cylinders. Arguably the best ""shoot-out"" in any film - ever. What more do you want???It's a long film but there is not one wasted scene in it. Even the incidental story lines - for example, the recently paroled ex-cell mate of Deniro whose first job is in a ""grill"" working for a nasty, exploitative boss and then ends-up as a stand-in getaway driver for Deniros crew. It just adds weight to the whole film. All the domestic dramas of the good-guys and the bad-guys that you wouldn't get in the typical cops and robbers film are shown in loving detail and nothing is rushed. Just makes it a more satisfying and involving film.Mann who started his career on Miami Vice almost seems to be taking a trip back to the eighties with the soundtrack and styling of the film - almost but not quite. If you still don't want to see the film after this then what the hell's wrong with you?! Sit back and enjoy. Also - no. 247 in the top 250?? Whats up with that???"
"Micheal Manns'(director of 'The Insider', and 'Manhunter') smooth, straightforward direction is studded with brilliant and very memorable cinematic gems in 'Heat',  A bullet riddled drama with, yes , Al Pacino and Robert De Niro in their first on screen meeting.What do you want to hear about 'Heat'.  Is it DeNiro's best performance? No. Is it Pacino's best performance? I'd be lying if I said it was.   Do the performances improve the story? Absolutely.   Mann has written (he wrote it as well) a complex and exciting two-sided story that develops the hunter Vincent Hanna (Pacino) and the hunted Neil McCauley (De Niro)  separately throughout much of the film.  Underneath a hail of bullets Mann is able to paint both lead characters with the same brush by delving into the similarly tragic and chaotic personal lives of Hanna and McCauley, allowing for the final epic scene, which would have been too pretentious if it were not for the excellent performances of Pacino and De Niro.Bottom Line:  Not having seen this movie is akin to idiocy for anyone claiming to be a fan of movies.   9 out of 10"
"Having seen almost every classic and influential crime drama of the past 30 years, I finally got around to seeing Heat. Having heard about how influential it has been in other movies and video games, I couldn't believe that I had waited so long to see this movie. Boy, was I disappointed. This movie is far from the masterpiece that I was led to believe. Other than a couple of great crime scenes (and a little bit of great action), I can't think of much that this film had that would make me want to see it again.While I wouldn't characterize the acting as bad, I can't think of anyone in this movie who gave a performance that is among their better ones. Al Pacino is practically a caricature of himself the entire time. He overacts in every scene and he yells about half of his lines. Robert Deniro has the same scowl on his face and speaks in pretty much the same voice for the whole movie. Pacino and Deniro fans looking for some ""tough guy"" porn will find plenty of it here.Ultimately, Heat is a movie that could have been made better by cutting about half the content. It is loaded with characters that are poorly developed, but are dramatically presented as if you are supposed to give a crap about any of them. One of them gets killed after about four minutes of screen time, and after that, we see his grieving wife. Rather than cry with her, I just kind of rolled my eyes. Another gang members death is presented with the drama akin to a squad mate getting killed in a war movie. I could have cared less. Val Kilmer's subplot centers around the tenuous relationship that he has with his wife. Al Pacino has a lousy third marriage and Robert Deniro somehow manages to have a romance side plot that is neither relevant nor believable.There is even a suicide attempt scene that has nothing whatsoever to do with the story – a diversion that will have you scratching your head, wondering why so much celluloid was wasted on it. Without exception, every single scene with a female in it could have been left on the cutting room floor, and not one shred of value would have been lost. None of the characters are sympathetic or well developed enough for you to want to see their romances work or to be able to share their pain. It would have worked well maybe in a television series where you would have more time to develop the characters, but here, all of the side plot material is really boring.One of the draws of this movie seems to be that it is a ""realistic"" and non ideal take on human behavior. Okay, I get that, but if you are going to go with the ""realistic"" approach, then don't ruin it with the occasional unbelievable scene or plot hole. The biggest offender is the famous bank robbery scene in the middle of the movie. It would have been spectacular in an action movie that didn't take itself seriously. But in Heat, I couldn't stop thinking about how absurd it was that a few guys with automatic weapons were able to cut through the entire LAPD like a hot knife through butter, escaping clean in the process. I still greatly enjoyed that scene, largely because it's just a great action scene that is well choreographed and shot. However, it's sort of out of place in this film.I'll give Heat some credit for not being a by-the-numbers cops and robbers movie. Maybe it is this uniqueness and the time of its release that made it so popular. Upon reflection though, there have been many crime and caper movies over the past few decades that are more entertaining than this one. Scarface, Reservoir Dogs, The Usual Suspects, to name but a few. While I didn't hate this movie, I certainly don't think that it deserves a place in the Top 10 greatest crime dramas."
"Why is Heat such a great movie? Is it because of the breathtaking amalgamation of story, music, image, action and acting that makes every scene worth watching over and over again? The authenticity of the world of cops and robbers he portrays? The acting of Pacino and De Niro? I have watched the movie at least twenty times. So have many others on the forum. Why the fascination?You can look at a masterwork by Rembrandt or Michelangelo endlessly and enjoy the beauty, the figures, the colors, the light And many of us do. But once you 'get' what the work of art is all about, once you connect it to the great themes in life, one's own life, it becomes deeply touching. Often what it's all about is deeply buried in layers upon layers of craftsmanship and sheer beauty. One becomes fascinated, one feels strong emotions, but one has to dig deep to explain why. The greater the mastery of the artist, the deeper one has to dig. The richer the treasures deep beneath the surface. So Michael Mann's mastery, for all its perfection, is only underpinning something of a higher order.In fact Heat has exactly the same essence as Ali, The Insider, Last of the Mohicans, Collateral and Thief. These movies, although superficially very different, are really quite similar in their core. They are all about making life-changing choices between different loyalties. Ultimate dilemmas. Heat is the most complex of all these movies in this respect and therefore in my opinion the greatest.What makes Mann's characters so fascinating? They rise to the occasion when facing 'heat': extremely adverse and often violent circumstances. They all face dilemmas, life-changing choices. They need to do the right thing, no matter how slim the chance of success, knowing they have to give up something else which is a good thing too. Vincent Hanna is not simply a workaholic. He gives up life as most of us know it (marriage, caring for his stepdaughter, 'barbeques and ballgames') because he knows he is such a gifted policeman that he can put away criminals behind bars, who will otherwise keep on killing the innocent people that haunt him in his dreams. But he can only defeat his adversaries if he is dedicated at the moments of truth. And he suffers for his dedication in all other realms of life. Neil McCauley forgoes normal life as well to be a perfect criminal and never be returned to jail, but starts feeling the cost of that only after falling in love, against his principles. He knows he can only stay out of jail when not attached to anyone or anything. (Therefore his home isn't even furnished.) To him that is the right thing to do. See, the values of Mann's characters are not necessarily 'right' or absolute values. Criminals have values too and their dilemmas can be just as difficult. After falling in love he feels a dilemma. And becomes much more human, albeit on the other side of the law.Why are some of the truly evil characters in Mann's movies so utterly evil? Because they are dedicated, but don't see the dilemma. They have chosen for their own ego, and pursue at any cost whatever drive they have, usually power and money (Van Zant, Insider's Thomas Sandefur, Thief's Leo), but alternatively perverse violence (Waingro) or revenge (Mohicans' Magua). They, directly or indirectly provide the 'heat' that make the more sympathetic characters have to choose whatever they think is 'the right thing'.Heat is stuffed with life-changing choices. Once you pay attention, it seems as if almost every other line in the movie has a question mark attached to it. 'Check, charge or cash?', are the first words in the movie. Not exactly life changing, OK, but a hint of all the choices to come . 'You taking me to breakfast?' follows shortly afterward. Less trivial. Then, every character is faced with choices between loyalties. All the most memorable moments in the film are about choices. Often very complex dilemmas. Charlene Shiherlis first chooses to betray her husband Chris to secure her son's future, but then when given the chance saves Chris's ass at the cost of probably never seeing him again. Neil drives through the tunnel with Eady on his way to freedom and ponders the idea to return and kill Waingro. De Niro's face shows the dilemma between loyalty one: getting away with his love, and loyalty two: revenge for Waingro's actions which have devastated his crew, with Chris wounded and on the run, Michael killed by Hanna in the shootout, Trejo tortured and mortally wounded (being subsequently put out of his misery by Neil himself) and Trejo's wife Anna violated and murdered. Neil simply cannot walk away from that. He calculates he can avenge his crew and get away afterward. But we later learn the presence of Eady at the hotel where Waingro is finished off, puts Hanna on Neil's tail for the final confrontation.In short, Mann's movies teach us: doing the right thing isn't straightforward. The choices in life aren't obvious.To do the right thing, you will have to give up what is good too and feel great loss. Doing the right thing doesn't result in a happy ending. You will feel vindicated at best. You may even die in the process.'I told you I was never going back'."
"Al Pacino plays a cop and an avid hunter who, once he gets a scent of his prey, feels some sort of self-motivation that perpetuates him He is a jackal addicted to this process This is an elevated state of being an intensely eager predator pursuing his prey until he gets him down As strange as it is, as scary as that world is, Lt. Hanna has a social conscience He has a normal spectrum of human feelings He's very authentic in how he loves his life The fusion of Robert De Niro and Neil McCauley is so total He's committed to the rigidity of that perspective and it's a heartbreaking role It's a tragic character In his world, what he's doing, he feels justified in doing it McCauley has a quiet look at a thief who has a certain kind of lonely disregard for who he kills but yet somehow you're in touch with his humanity We can identify him when all that robbery turns out badly and when his lover Eady (Amy Brenneman) tries to escape from him Brenneman's part was the hope that De Niro's character could have of escape, and love, and forgiveness There's something so sad about these people and so poignant They are so lost, and they want to be found so badlyIt's like a huge opera On one level, the film deals with a crime saga, on the other, with the interpersonal relationships that are woven all these charactersIn the Pacino character and in the De Niro character you're basically seeing two sides of the same tough man"
"I remember seeing this in my childhood and being extremely impressed with it. Some scenes have stayed with me all this time. However, revisiting ""Heat"" 17 years later was a disappointment. The story looks far fetched and riddled with clichés and improbabilities.The main problem is with the selling point, which is of course the ""Al Pacino- De Niro relationship"". Here's the problem: no cop who does this job out of conviction could possibly respect/admire a criminal, especially one who has killed other police officers. So the ending is absurd and downright ludicrous. The famous coffee-shop scene that Pacino and De Niro share is ridiculous and pointless, entirely made for us, the viewers. At the public request, we present you Pacino and De Niro, face to face! The clash of the titans! Not only there is no way in hell that a committed policeman would casually sit and chat with a criminal over coffee, but what they have to say is so silly – sharing thoughts about their messed-up private lives? Pacino trying to talk De Niro out of the bank robbery business? Seriously? Such a lame excuse to deliver the much anticipated De Niro- Pacino ""moment""... The writing is terrible in this scene, as De Niro is also restating something he'd said earlier, therefore diminishing the impact of that line. Another example of bad writing and poor characterization is a scene where Jon Voight warns De Niro about Pacino's tenacity.The constant shift to everybody's private lives was annoying and turned the whole thing into a crime-opera cheesefest. How many times have we seen the ""frustrated cop's wife"" act? And who cares about the bank robber's problems with his beloved wife, whom he occasionally cheats on? Oh, yeah, bank robbers are capable of love too. Touching! Talking about unlikelihood, De Niro's ""romance"" was laughable, and so was the transformation of an innocent librarian into an accessory to murder. The way Amy Brenneman switches from horror at what De Niro did to the ""Oh, well, he's cute anyway"" is hysterical. Moral relativism is an interesting topic for sure, but not here. There are moments that we're supposed to find moving, like the miscast Ashley Judd shedding a tear on the balcony or the cop hero Pacino holding hands with a criminal... What a joke.The movie does contain some entertaining moments (although highly improbable), like the robbery scene. There's no way the Police would get into a shootout like that with so many civilians around. The suicide attempt scene is unnecessary and forced, and there are other flaws and extremely far-fetched/illogical scenes throughout, like DeNiro & the gang gracefully passing through police check-points without even wearing a disguise, just hours after the bloody robbery.""Heat"" is fairly entertaining only if you can ignore its inconsistencies and plot holes. The more I watch, the more I find it insulting to one's intelligence. I know it's ""just a movie"", but come on... it's a 3-hour movie, and such an amount of implausible developments make suspension of disbelief pretty hard. I swear, if Pacino had shed a tear in the end, I would have rated ""Heat"" with 10 stars and put it on my all time favorite ""so bad they're good"" list."
"There is so much more to Heat than whats on its surface. It is so well directed, acted,written, scored and photographed that it takes mulitple viewings to take it all in. This is the best crime movie ever made. And, since my first viewing over 5 years ago, I have seen it a countless number of times. After all of these viewings I can only say that this is my favorite film to watch and therefore the best film I have ever seen. I will not divulge into plot because the expanse and depth of the films story, I could not do justice with a shorthand overview of its plot. This film is not about its plot, it is about its characters and what they feel. Michael Mann is my favorite filmmaker, his list of credits, admittedly, doesn't strike many people as the resume of the greatest living director, but when you watch those films you can see the gift this man possesses at telling a story and making us feel for his characters. There are three scenes in this movie that had me so drawn in, I still think about them often. One is the films first scene, Elliot Goldenthal's mesmirizing electronic score captivates us in the first shots of the train carrying Neal McCauley (Robert DeNiro)and leave me, and the audience wanting more. The third comes toward the end as McCauley and his boss Nate (a wonderful Jon Voigt) exchange their last words as Neal is planning on leaving the country the words the choose and attitudes they strike almost had me in tears. These are two hard men and this is far as they will go with their heartfelt goodbyes. The films last scene I will not give a description to as not to ruin the plot for you. I contains the best (almost) wordless exchange I've ever seen in a film. The music swells and Mann allows us to linger on the last shot. It brought me to tears, and still does. This is the best film I've ever seen. I doubt you will see it that way, but trust me you will love it."
"Some people say this movie takes too much time to show the conclusion,which is predictable. As for me,that opinion is nothing. Everything about this movie is perfect. The time length makes this movie great. It's spectacular. The action scenes are great. The characters are great. The way of showing them is great. This movie is worth watching over and over. One of the best movies I've ever seen."
"The flaw of all gangster movies, at least those acknowledged as ""classics"" (Godfather trilogy, Scarface, Goodfellas, Casino, White Heat, Once Upon A Time In America etc), is how obvious and predictable their narrative progressions are. We get the rise, the joyous ecstasy of crime and the obvious monetary rewards, and the fall, that period where the world violently collapses around the criminal. With the scripts all so loosely similar, it just becomes a game of dress up. Of who has the best period details, acting and set design.Released the same year as Scorsese's ""Casino"", Michael Mann's ""Heat"" positions itself as one of the first ""neo liberal"" gangster movies, all the others still caught in the old framework of mafia patriarchy, family values, loyalty, honour, total adherence to a distinctive creed, blood lines and tribalism. ""Heat"", in comparison, completely breaks away from these old-fashioned ways. In Mann's film, everyone is an individual in the most extreme sense. The gang is no longer a gang, but a crew of ""independent professionals"" who just come together for a specific job and then split. In this world, families and friends are non-existent or total charades.While Don Corleone hid like a king behind his armed guards and giant fences, Mann's gangsters are trapped in a state of perpetual mobility. Like a group of shareholders, they are held together only by the prospect of future revenue. Their arrangement is temporary, pragmatic and lateral. They know that they are interchangeable parts in a larger machine, that there are no guarantees and that nothing lasts. Compared to this, the gangsters of ""Goodfellas"" and ""The Godfather"" seem like stagnated sentimentalists, nostalgically trapped in dying communities. While The Corleone's fight over territory and family honour, Mann's guys are only interested in Capital. As DeNiro yells during a bank heist, ""We're here for the bank's money, not your money!""Tellingly, the DeNiro character's creed is one of ""zero loyalty"". He has a 30-second rule of walking away from anyone, however close he may be emotionally or romantically. The message of the film is thus double edged. It isn't just that the film's final resolution is that ""justice prevails"" and the bad guys are put away; rather, it is that those who fall, who get caught, are those who failed to live up to the modern creed, which is actually repeated twice in the film: ""Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner."" In other words, late capitalism and attachment do not mix.So in this sense, a film like ""Heat"", though otherwise entirely predictable, essentially a bunch of little boys engaging in idiot machismo one-upmanship posturing (Pacino's obsessive-compulsive manic cop vs DeNiro's cool sociopathic dedication, etc), nevertheless was one of the first films to manifest a fundamental social change. A series like ""The Wire"" then takes all of this much further, with its attempt to consciously map out the vast and unrepresentable complexity of contemporary neo-liberal capitalism. (In fact, a series like ""The Wire"", with its sheer scope, complexity and writing credentials, renders ALL gangster and crime movies irrelevant to any serious viewer.)And so today's gangsters are all ""entrepreneurs"", all so called ""self-made individuals"", the ""self-employed Petite bourgeoisie"", radically without any social links, even down to the kid selling crack to his buddies. This is all a million light years from the long obsolete world of ""The Godfather"", ""Casino"" or ""Goodfellas"". While those elegiac films are about moments that had long passed, Mann's is distinctively modern. This is a film about the 90s. This is a Los Angeles of polished chrome, designer kitchens, featureless freeways, fluorescent bulbs and late night diners. All the colours, sounds, aromas and cultural quirks of Coppola and Scorsese have been torn out, painted over, re-fitted and re-modelled. Mann's LA is a world without landmarks. A vast urban sprawl, all traces of Old Europe replaced by business franchises, multiplexes and multinational coffee shops. While Coppola's film centred around a family called the ""Corleone's"", their name itself a reference to the village in which they originated, Mann's criminals have bland names like ""Neil"". They are without history, culture or family ties. In a brilliant touch, Mann even has De Niro reading a book on metals when he first meets his love interest. The guy is a piece of cold, polished steel in a world that is likewise.Rather than a ""rise/fall"" structure we also get something a bit different. These criminals get no joy from their profession. Trapped in a world of paranoia, Mann's aesthetic is one of flat glass panes and expansive windows, his criminals always fearing exposure. For Mann, crime becomes a means of escape from the world in its entirety. Crime is total disconnection from both family, society and man, his criminals all looking to amass enough wealth to escape to some idyllic island on the horizon.But it's Mann's style itself that seduces us. This style, which I call ""Armani decorum"", owes much to Mann's fondness for such painters and architects as David Hockney, Alex Colville, Edward Hopper and Ed Ruscha (Alex Colville's ""Pacific"" is visually quoted in one shot). Mann's thus trades the ""old noir"" look for 1950's modernism, block colours, expansive glass panes, geometric divisions and contemporary, linear houses. His frame is divided into flat surfaces, characters are dressed in pastels, scenes are assigned panels of light and buildings are relentlessly modernist, with fluorescent bulbs and geometrical, flat surfaces. Couple this with his unique choice in music (minimalist, industrial and techno) and you have a very sexy aesthetic.8.9/10 – Dismissed upon release, ""Heat"" achieved ""classic"" status a few years later due to young film buffs. As the star status of De Niro and Pacino fades, and films like ""Dark Knight"" rip off its style, the film seems to be on another downward spiral.Worth several viewings."
"I think I watched this once a very long time ago when I was young, but I didn't remember much. Now that The Irishman is coming up with De Niro and Paciono again, it made me look into this movie and rewatch at, now as an adult, very long after the first time, and it was almost like I was watching it for the first time.This movie is so damn good. I can't remember the last time I saw a crime thriller this good, so I guess sthey just don't make them like this anymore, sadly...The writing, the characters, the directing, the acting, the action, the drama, the suspense, the music...It's all so good, I have to say this is probably one of the best movies in the genre that I've seen. A masterpiece. The 3 hours do not overstay their welcome. This one will most likely grip you. I grew attached to the villain, even though I knew I shouldn't. Do yourself a favour and watch this. For myself I think I'm gonna go ahead and buy it, actually. Movies rarely ever satisfy me like this anymore..."
"This has everything, a truly amazing film with an excellent cast, i can't imagine any movie fan that haven't seen this but if you haven't then you must. Pure action and excitement"
"This movie was good.  I loved the gun fight scene in Downtown LA and Neil's last confrontation with Waingro.  This must've been my fourth time watching it and I still enjoy watching those two scenes. However, much of the rest of the movie could've been edited out. I always thought it ran a little long.  Also, I thought the dialogue could've been better.  Am I alone on this?  Everyone seems to praise this movie as one of the best they've seen.  Am I the only one who thinks the sub-plots, especially those involving the characters' personal lives could've been shortened or eliminated altogether?  And that the dialogue was weak, even during that coffee shop scene?  The pacing was slow and, except for a few scenes, the movie was boring.  The movie was basically a few great scenes strung together by a lot of weak ones.  Despite the movie's flaws, I enjoyed some of the action sequences and the performances of Al Pacino and Robert Dinero.  It's too bad they didn't get a better script.  In short, this is an over-rated film that ran too long and that has a couple of great actors and some good action scenes.  7/10 stars."
"This is my first review I have ever written on IMDb. I felt the urge to do so quite a lot of times, but I thought there were so many already for the movies I wanted to do it for that there was no need. I just finished watching this movie for maybe the 20th time in my life of 26 years. There is simply one word this movie can be described with, and that is Masterpiece. Why do I say masterpiece? Because of this: 1. Acting - Stellar cast, most of them at the height of their careers. 2. Plot - Great story, plot holes are just for the nitpickers or the haters; 3. Cinematography - Probably some of the best heist scenes and a city at night ever shot on film. 4. Characters - Not all of them, but the main characters are well developed and you understand their motivation, their actions, their thoughts. This movie will not let you down. Perfect to watch in any situation."
"The simple fact that a movie contains two great actors does not make it a great movie. The interaction scenes between the two feel forced in writing and in the acting. The movie suffers from a sub-standard plot. In the end he does not drop and run. It makes no sense. The ending is forced into the good guy wins Hollywood ending. If he had gotten away it would have made much more sense. Often when I have have mentioned that this movie is sub-par others have reacted with shock, ""Its Pacino and Dinero!,"" they always reply. Then I ask what makes the movie any good and ""Pacino/Dinero"" is the only response they can come up with."
"Take the big moment of this movie. What the trailers touted. What was supposed to be the meeting of giants. The coffee scene with Deniro and Pacino. Both legendary film actors with credentials that are undeniable. What possessed them to allow this scene to get to the screen is beyond me. If your 10 years old you could have written the dialog. If your not and have kids, they have. In fact I have written this dialog as have many people that have put pen to paper and were ever drawn to cop/robber dramatic films. ""your going down brother"" Need I say more.Then I read the reviews here and I am even more stunned. If you eliminate the horrific Pacino/Deniro scene you have a decent movie. Perhaps I would have given it a 5. Plot lines that were meaningless. A movie that tried very, very hard to be something more than it is, or was. Over direction. And the rest of the script wasn't Shakespeare either. It wasn't just the ""big"" scene. It was all of them. Kilmer's part was comical. I don't think that was the intent.Anyway, I suppose, based on the unbelievable reviews for this movie here, I am in the vast minority. So if you haven't seen it yet all I would say is this. If we assume you have some degree of film intellect, then do not expect to see what you read in some of these reviews. If you go in not expecting much you may very well enjoy this very ordinary movie. if you go in expected the ""Best movie of the 90s"" or a ""masterpiece"" you may be sorely disappointed. I will laugh about these reviews for days. Utterly amazing otherwise intelligent people could be hypnotized by the hype of this film. Guys, at best it's a 5 out of 10."
"What makes ""Heat"" such a unique crime film is that it is both a gangster and a cop picture, which means that it spans an equal amount of time in both sides of the law and still manages to be original and compelling when they go toe-to-toe. This is a film that is obviously addressed to viewers who are familiar enough with heists, shootouts and police procedural to believe they've seen them all, but Michael Mann made a 180-minute script, as methodic, intelligent and articulate as its characters. And speaking of characters, they're not defined by some narrative status, sure, the criminals are the bad guys and the cop the heroes, but the film mainly shows them as men, with lives, wives, girlfriends, motives and weaknesses, and it takes all the time needed to do it in the most absorbing way. After all, you don't just make a character-driven picture about five or six people in ninety minutes. Now, let's get deeper in the film.Generally, in cop movies like the 'Dirty Harry' films, you have the central protagonist and the 'charismatic' villain. Gangster movies are centered on a specific operation and the gangsters' personalities generally undermine the outcome. ""Heat"" works on these two levels but with one pivotal difference: the cop and the bandit are not portrayed in a way that would influence our empathy. The cop, Vincent Hanna, is a tormented guy who can't handle his third wife and depressed stepdaughter, and Neil McCauley is a solitary criminal who lives by a code. His golden rule is not to depend on something he can't get rid of in less than 30 seconds. Did I mention that Al Pacino and De Niro play these guys? Of course, everyone knows but does it matter? These two actors are my all-time favorite, but the story is so engaging and well-written that I'm sure any other actors would have made it work. ""Heat"" is so good that even the Pacino-De Niro pairing (the first since ""The Godfather Part II"") almost feels like a publicity stunt, as if the film needed that little kick. Well, I'm glad they picked these two actors, and their confrontation in the coffee scene, halfway through the film is a highlight and the best illustration of the film's central theme: men who live for their job and don't know whether they enjoy the action or they're entrapped in the impossibility to live a 'normal' life because of their jobs. They have more in common than they think, and they're both atypical even within their crew.Still, from the way the conversation ends, we know their worlds tightly interact but don't mix. There will be a confrontation sooner or later. The film doesn't sugarcoat the criminal doings, nor does it ridicule the cops and that's important. The character of De Niro outshines the others because of his no-nonsense professionalism, beautifully echoed by the more volatile and dangerous personality of the villain within the villains, played by a convincing Kevin Gage. Now, that Waingro is a creepy criminal who adds his little spice to the film, and whenever he's is on the screen, you know there's trouble coming. He's a disturbing human being but crucial to the film, we know McCauley is on the wrong side of the law, still, he's closer to Hana than to Waingro.""Heat"" is a patient and serious epic-scale crime drama that borrows many elements from a director I admire: Jean-Pierre Melville. There's a Samurai-like quality in McCauley and maybe a little something from Lino Ventura, physically. Here is a tough guy dedicated to his job, and nothing else, which means no girls but if he finds the right one, he might change his mind, for better or worse. ""Heat"" is about many men who end up acting according to their nature, even if it implies a price. And while the main focus is on Pacino and De Niro, it would be unfair to ignore Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Ashley Judd, Jon Voight and Natalie Portman who seemed to have gained in maturity ever since ""Leon"". If Melville inspires Mann, he distances himself by giving a more substantial role to the women, the film features many domestic scenes and marital arguments and overall, the women are not just used like props to their men's macho appeal.But I make the film sound like some existential journey while it also a school-case of thrilling action sequences and a bank robbery providing the most spectacular shootout you'll ever see, it is long but you never feel anything happening there gratuitous, from the first moment where they enter the bank, the way they handle the robbery and leave the car, you almost feel sorry for the cops' arrival, not because you root for the criminals, but because the real chaos and loss of lives result from the shootout. And some deaths come as unexpected and shocking but they're here to show how random and cruel life is, after all, the whole chain of events started with a miscast criminal, who was lucky enough to escape from his execution. Karma is also an important character in the film.So we have one of the greatest shootouts of cinema's history, one of the most elaborate criminal operations and equally gripping police investigation, an intelligent drama about men ruling their lives according to what they do the best and we don't necessarily enjoy what we do the best. And we have a director who seems to have embraced the professionalism of his characters to make his personal masterpiece, perhaps the ultimate cop/gangster picture and it's only fitting that the film confronts the actors who played more gangsters and cops than any others. And if ""Heat"" is a inspired by classic Melville film-noir crime flicks, Christopher Nolan admitted to have borrowed elements from ""Heat"" to make ""The Dark Knight"". See, the torch was passed and ""Heat"" is now a milestone."
"Still, after all these years, one of my favorite films. Not just because of the great cast, but the overall vibe and style is superb. When this movie was just released I was blown away by the shootout scene at the bank, but in the years after I found myself enjoying every single scene. One of the few films where the violence serves the storytelling instead of replacing it. Also the dialogues are sometimes poetry without losing credibility. The soundtrack is timeless and sets the right tone, straight from the beginning. An almost dreamy world that portrays a harsh one. I am writing this review (my first) on IMDb to honor this movie that never bores me. And as a filmmaker, it really influenced me a lot."
"Five years ago to this date, I was pretty tired from working all day at my job at the cinema.  However, I did manage to stay awake for a almost three hour epic that blew my mind away and saw a different way to look at the cinema.  Before this film, the director Michael Mann, has shown the life of crime in THIEF, terror in THE KEEP, suspense in MANHUNTER, and a historical epic with LAST OF THE MOHICIANS.  But Mann's film were going on a upswing, and with HEAT, Mann reached peak level. This is a film that will go down in history.  Granted, it's not as much as a classic as SCHINDLER'S LIST and GOODFELLAS.  But HEAT will give future generations a example of what the world and life style was like in the 1990's.  Where NASHVILLE is for the 70's, and film by John Hughes is for the 80's, HEAT is for the 90's.While living in central Los Angeles for over three months, the images and scenes from HEAT couldn't leave my mind.  Mann did a fabulous job by shooting the film on the actual streets of L.A.  The film shows the dark and gritty world where we are use to the palm trees and beaches.  Mann's L.A. has some fancy art deco buildings mixed in with decaying buildings.  The streets of Koreatown where all the signs are in Korean, the run down coffee shop that is hidden among giant skyscrapers. If anyone wants to know what L.A. really looks like, this is the perfect film that shows the viewer the real world of L.A. There's the brilliant plot.  Some would say that it's a remake of Mann's eariler work, L.A. TAKEDOWN. But Mann took a simple story and turned it into a epic, and that is exactly what HEAT is, a epic.  Multiple characters, multiple stories, different conflicts and situations and adding a blend of fantastic action into it.  I love the way the characters and story works.  Al Pacino playing Vincent Hannah, the lead detective who is tracking down a group of professional thiefs led by Neil McCauley played by Robert DeNiro.  Unlike any other crime-action film that I have seen, HEAT has both the police officers and criminals being highly intelligent!  No bad doughnut jokes, no bumbling crooks, no ""I'm getting too old for this"" lines, etc.  The thieves use clever plans to stage and work out a robbery, while the officers use clever actions to identify and gather evidence of the criminals. The look by Dante Spinotti is beautiful.  The L.A. skyline with his famous tint shade of blue makes L.A. look like a million stars in the sky. His shots of the empty apartment that McCauley owes with the Pacific Ocean in the background.  The music by Elliot Goldenthal is also fantastic, it has a techno beat that adds to the suspense and excitement that the film is showing.  But it's the score by famous artist Moby that rises above the rest of the film's music.  With Hannah speeding down Interstate 5 while ""New Dawn Fades"" is blasting on the soundtrack, and the magical and beautiful ""God Moving Over the Face of Waters"" being played at the ending credits.  Moby was quoted recently that ""God Moving"" is his favourite song that he has composed, he says that it brings tears to his eyes whenever he hears it. While I listen to it, the song gives me goosebumps and I can not think of the blue Pacific Ocean with the lights from the L.A. coast. And should I mention the acting, which is the best casting in the history of film.  Not only do you have two of the best actors working right now, DeNiro and Pacino, but here is a small list of who else is in this classic:  Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore, Diane Verona, Amy Brenneman, Ashley Judd, Mykelti Williamson, Wes Studi, Dennis Haysbert, Hank Azaria, William Fichtner, Henry Rollins, and Natalie Portman.  If you're going to have two fantastic actors in the lead roles, then you need to have a strong supportive cast with them, and that is what Mann does.  But it's Pacino's and DeNiro's performances are the strong stand-outs.  The scene where Hannah and McCauley are sitting down at a table in a coffee shop is of equal rank as Moses parting the Red Sea in TEN COMMANDMENTS.  Or Indiana Jones running away from the giant boulder in RAIDERS. Yes, these are bold statements to say, but if you have ever been to Los Angeles, you would understand.  And I don't mean the tourist city of Anaheim, I mean the real streets of L.A.  COLORS and BOYZ N' THE HOOD do show a pretty realistic L.A., but it's HEAT that shows the real Los Angeles. This is a film that when you first see it, it's good, but the more you watch it, the more you love it.  That is why I an not going to say to just see this film, but you should buy this film!  Believe me, for the last four years, I've been buying this movie on video or DVD for friends of mine. It's become my own personal chain letter, and every time I give them the movie, they come back telling me they loved it.  Please do yourself a favour, and see this film that is the ultimate image of the last decade of the 20th century. ***** (one of the top 10 films of all time!!!!)"
"After watching this film for what seems the 100th time - I have come to the conclusion that it is truly a masterpiece crime drama.Mann has done so many good films, in different genres, like Last of the Mohicans, Manhunter, Collateral, The Insider, Thief - and yet this film stands head and shoulders above the others. Truly epic is scale, the tale of Cop and Thief is explored to its max, and is executed with extreme flair.De Niro and Pacino are top of their game - this being De Niro's last great role (along with the fantastic Casino). Both play their roles with precision - and when they finally meet (in the diner scene) both excel, neither putting an end to the ""who is better"" stakes. Pacino and his mouthy, yet troubled cop and De Niro's syntax-troubled thief make for one of the greatest duels in crime cinema history.Yet it is the fantastic team of supporting actors who help the main stars keep their balance. Val Kilmer, Natalie Portman, Diane Venora - only to mention a few - are fantastic.Heat is a modern noir, the urban Gothic, with stark sky's, hauntingly human snyth and a bruised L.A landscape. Mann has created such a deep film, that I can't express how much it means to me. Drama is great, acting is great and the action is superb (the heist scene to end all heist scenes) - so this film is the jewel in Mann's crown - and a benchmark for other films in the genre."
"I used to love this film for the action sequences and that beautiful blue-tinted cinematography, Los Angeles looking as clear and smooth as the ocean Neil looks out on in reflection. De Niro and Pacino fully inhabit characters that are two sides of a coin, Neil (De Niro) an introverted loner and a professional thief in charge of a crew, and Vincent (Pacino) a disillusioned cop who finds a connection with Neil, who he likes and considers a star, reflecting his own professional, no- nonsense approach, a glimmer of hope in an otherwise dreary career in which he must expose himself to all kinds of horror and sickness which he goes into great detail describing in order to stop his partner from complaining about relationship problems. Pacino has some of the best and funniest line in the whole film. It was a stroke of brilliance to have both De Niro and Pacino play characters perfectly suited for them. Pacino is often accused of hamming it up, and although he does chew scenery in this film, that's the character he plays and I always found him a very subtle actor whose expressions speak volumes. De Niro of course is brilliant, that goes without say, and plays a likable crook who has found his niche on the other side of the law and does what he does best. Any attachments they have don't seem to work, and the only real bond they find is with each other through their mutual cat-and-mouse interest in one another. The film isn't just about those two characters though, and while it is a crime film, that's just a foundation for a sprawling, meticulously detailed yet effortless, interwoven narrative involving many people. The way it all comes together as the film progresses feels almost cosmic. Waingro (Kevin Kage) is sort of a spanner in the works throughout the film, a sort of devil of chaos with no awareness of what he's doing (?) who shoots cops in the opening heist and gets Vincent involved in the case and on the trail of Neil. He vanishes almost supernaturally when Neil tried to kill him and pops up in multiple uncanny ways to botch things up for his old crew and his new employer Van Sant (William Fichtner). He even manages to bring Neil and Vincent together in the end by being the chief motivator for Neil's detour from his escape to a new haven after the disastrous heist. Neil kills Waingro in a sort of cathartic cleansing, before being hunted down by Vincent and shot in the final hunt. They both kind of save each other in the end and it turns out the way Neil wanted it. It was his wish all along to die at the hands of this cop who knows him as well as he does, and it gives him a sort of release for the afterlife. I guess that makes Vincent, his hunter, his Shepherd. It's a moving ending to a great film, and the final scenes of Vincent holding Neil by the hand in his last moments as they stand in the night against the airport lights, the plane to a life Neil was never allowed departed and his downfall as it illuminates his shadow giving Vincent his cue to take Neil down, are all just perfect. It all feels very fatalistic in a profound way. The film is a great noir because it's all about purpose and the search for it. The supporting cast is also great, after all it's an ensemble film and there's a whole host of interesting, well played characters I haven't even mentioned because I can't be bothered now."
"I know millions probably ""commented"" on this film but I feel a weird urge to do so myself.This movie is actually ""Perfect"" it is virtually impossible to make it any better. I remember seeing this in theaters, not some Hollywood screening or fest or anything like that. I have never seen a movie where people applauded while the movie was in progress.I often describe this film to people who people who tell me they never saw it, after recovering a from a near heart attack from shock, that its a Action film so good you cant believe that its a drama while at the same time it is a Drama film so good you cant believe it is an action film.I've seen it 10 times and there are those moments where I still hold my breath in suspense along side with the characters when they reach those 'moments'. Kind of hard to try and not spoil the movie so I will do my best, when you see it you'll know what Im talking about.If you haven't seen it, I am so jealous as I would love to see it through the first timers eyes again!"
"""Heat"", much more than a typical crime drama, is a character-driven masterpiece of writing and a film so riveting and fascinating that one cannot take his or her eyes off the film for one second without possibly missing a masterful shot or a fine bit of character development. If the film's intelligent, appropriately 'epic', character-driven screenplay wasn't enough to make this a great film, then surely Mann's brilliant direction, Dante Spinotti's photography, and Elliot Goldenthal's memorable score make this a great film.Of course, the big selling point for ""Heat"" to this day is the union of screen legends Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. I am not certain whether the film's excellent screenplay was written by Mann with these two actors in mind, but it doesn't feel like it because it does not feel for a second like a cheap marketing gimmick, and the two actors actually share very little screen time together (for the first time, as despite both of them appearing in ""The Godfather: Part II"", they were not in any scenes together). When they do, it is tasteful and interesting. The scene in the diner where they first really meet, not counting a quick encounter on the street just before, is perhaps the true centerpiece of the film, even more so than the famed shootout. In that short, beautiful scene the two main characters discover just how similar to and yet different from each other they are. The film is brilliantly. It is around three hours in length, but passes faster than most 90 minute films. The film masterfully builds tension while developing characters in its early stages in what some might call subplots, which is entirely missing the point of this film being driven by the characters rather than strictly by the plot. The film has a loose 'main' plot, but is a true epic, one which concentrates on many different characters and stories in almost equal measure. It builds up to a climax which lasts for an entire hour, a riveting, spectacular, epic, brilliant hour of film that begins with the shootout. Oh, the great, famous ""Heat"" shootout in the middle of the street in broad daylight. My opinion may be blasphemy to some, but I think this is one of the best and most exciting scenes in film history. It's as well-shot and edited as any of cinema's most well-known action scenes.The immediate thing that stands out about the visual look of the film is how carefully and beautifully composed some of the shots are, the prime example being the film's stunning final shot (which follows an equally astonishing final sequence), which is certainly up there with the great final shots in cinema. The film's look cannot be credited entirely to Mann, as frequent Mann collaborator (The Last of the Mohicans, The Insider) Dante Spinotti's work as cinematographer is certainly impressive as well. This cast is certainly much bigger than Pacino and De Niro, and I can't think of one performance, not even Jon Voight's that can be called anything less than excellent. From Val Kilmer to Tom Sizemore to Ted Levine to Ashley Judd, the supporting cast is terrific. Even Natalie Portman's good.""Heat"" is a masterclass. The writing, direction, cinematography, acting, everything about the film is great from start to finish. Truly a brilliant film, and one that will not be forgotten anytime soon. It doesn't work because it is a good crime thriller, it works because it's a terrific character drama, one which I find more and more involving with every viewing."
I'm not going to say anything about the movie as it can speak for itself. All I am going to say is that this movie is a must watch no matter your taste.
'Heat' is a piece of art that is masterfully written. The characters are superbly portrayed by a dream cast. And this masterpiece is crafted with genius and love by one of greatest American authors in Filmmaking History.
"Take it from me this has to be the very best crime film , up with the God Father"
"Heat is a classic and is elevated above the standard cops and robbers film by a few elements. Firstly it has possibly the two greatest actors of all time Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. Secondly it is written and directed by the greatest filmmaker of all time Michael Mann. Thirdly it has a who's who of supporting actors. Fourthly all this is crammed into an epic 160 minutes with some of the greatest filmmaking you will ever see. Thief, Manhunter and Heat are three films to be treasured."
"Best cast, best direction, best story... I love this movie. It is my number 1. DeNiro and Pacino at odds and on screen (finally) since Godfather II. Michael Mann is phenomenal. I could watch this action/thriller/drama/love story any day of the week."
"I remember watching this movie on VHS on my tv in Tokyo. The robbery shootout was what stuck in my mind. I just watched it again with 4 millenials who usually have the attention of a chat. They were glued to it for the (almost 3 hours). Great performances, character development and, oh my, the set pieces. One of the greats."
This movie has the best shootout scene ever made. Let's argue. They were the criminals that you wanted to win. i freaking love this movie. I became a serious Val Kilmer fan after seeing this one.
"I gave this a 1 MOSTLY because not only is this movie absolutely terrible, but it is absolutely terrible AND nearly 3 hours long.The plot to this movie is completely awful. The synopsis given by IMDb does not even remotely describe this movie. Maybe that's what the screenwriter possibly intended this movie to be about, and it started out that way the first 30 minutes (maybe), but it went in all kinds of directions with a bunch of meaningless plot-lines, meaningless characters, meaningless scenes.The acting, fine. Everything else, why? What were you thinking? Were you thinking? <-THAT kind of bad.We are introduced to several characters and their little lives like they mean something, like they're going to be something. Then they die, or just drop off out of the movie entirely for no reason.Ultimate crime drama? I don't think so. Every criminal in this movie is an idiot. They're sloppy, make amateur mistakes in the first 10 minutes of the movie, and yet it's shoved in your face that ""De Niro's character is so clever and smart, always one step ahead"". If he's so smart, why hire a new guy in the beginning for a heist that kills someone and nearly screws your heist over? Then as De Niro goes to take care of the problem and kill him, he looks away (without a hold on the guy) and lets him get away? Didn't watch him or hear him? That was in the first 30 minutes.The rest of the movie is just complete trash. We get random scenes of these criminal men with their families and how happy their lives are, but not enough to actually give an attachment to their character. We get random scenes of the detective, Pacino's character, in his little life. There was no point in introducing us to the drama of each of these lives, because none of these characters matter and ALL are cut out at the end with no closure, and no real story to close, besides Pacino and De Niro.By the end of the movie, the ""plot"" is the struggle between these two conflicting men and their will to do what they want in life. A very dramatic, drawn-out showdown, and De Niro goes down with Pacino holding his hand until his end. How touching. By that time, Pacino's character would have hated him, as De Niro's character shot down his cop friends right in front of him, and De Niro would hate Pacino for killing his friend. So why is there this touching scene where they are now at a closure in their relationship? They met once for coffee.... this supposed epic coffee scene, and talked about how neither would back down to the other. Afterward they killed each others' people and both were raging at the other. De Niro's character can't let a grudge sit (at least this is what the plot would have us believe) and kills everyone that betrayed him without mercy the rest of the movie. But Pacino, this man he met once, is different somehow? If you decide to watch this movie, watch it with much reservation and no expectations."
"Spoilers herein.Here we have two of the most outrageous muggers of modern film: Pacino with full HooHaa and DeNiro dragging his biggest grimace.Obviously, this film was first conceived with the two facing each other at the diner, to be followed by a massive shootout. Give everyone women problems. Fill in the rest with some Mann repeats and heist mechanics. The result is incoherent, simply jelly to stick some episodes together.
Some of these are tolerable -- any of the scenes with Diane Venora or Jon Voigt. Venora knows how to be outside and inside at the same time. Everything else is TeeVee hash.That's because Pacino and DeNiro have just given up trying. Their `method' is to find the character in themselves, which is NOT method acting, at least the Brando style. The problem is simply that these two actors are not interesting people, far less interesting than their characters might be.
Ted's evaluation: 1 of 4 -- You can find something better to do with your time."
"Heat is written and directed by Michael Mann. It stars Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino, Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore, Diane Venora, Ashley Judd, Amy Brennerman and Danny Trejo. Music is scored by Elliot Goldenthal and cinematography by Dante Spinoti.Big time thief Neil McCauley (DeNiro) is after one last major score before he retires, but hot on his tail is Vincent Hannah (Pacino), a cop equally and methodically as driven as he is himself.In the build up to Heat's release, much was made of it being the first on screen pairing of DeNiro and Pacino. A mouthwatering prospect for sure, it proved to be worth the wait and unfolds as a lesson in restrained acting with two modern greats affording each other the respect that was due. What we didn't realise in the build up to the film's release, was that it would prove to be one of the greatest cops and robbers movies of all time, brought to us by an auteur director whose kink for realism and commitment to research stands him out from much of the modern directing pack.Rarely does a film come together as one, where all the cogs of the engine are in tune, but Heat is one such picture. From cast performances to visual aesthetics, to screenplay and actual substance of story, Heat is as meticulous as it is thrilling. There are a myriad of characters brilliantly stitched together in one de-glamorised City of Angels, as plot develops, and each character and their crumbling relationships come under inspection, we are witnessing a coarse viewpoint of human nature, where people's lives are ended or defined by their choices. Everywhere you look, here, there are folk cracking under the strain of being exposed to high end crime, dreams, hopes and happiness are unlikely to be achieved, and this is on both sides of the law.For Heat, Mann fuses the tonal and visual ticks of Manhunter with that of the adrenalin rushes from Last of the Mohicans, with the former gorgeously born out by Spinoti's pin sharp photography, the latter thrillingly realised by Mann's skill at action set pieces. Once again word of mouth about the key heist and shoot out in the film led to high expectation, and again there is no disappointment. L.A. becomes a battle ground, rapid gunfire punctures the air, cars swerve and crash, bodies fall, visually and aurally it drags you to the edge of your seat, an extended action sequence fit to sit with the best of them. The kicker as well is that because Mann has been so detailed in his characterisations, we care about what happens to all parties, we understand motives and means. Which in a film with such a huge support cast is quite an achievement.There is enough in Heat to fill out a dozen other cops and robbers films, fans of neo-noir and crime films in general are spoilt supreme here. It's not rocket science really, put a group of great actors together, give them an intelligent script to work from and let them be guided by a director who will not sit still, and you get a great film. Heat, the ultimate predator and prey movie, where from beginning to end it refuses to be lazy or cop out, and energy and thought seeps from every frame. 10/10"
"Director Michael delivers one of the best thrillers of the last few decades with Heat. A movie that came out in 1995 and continues to influence every heist movie that has come after it. I have yet to witness a heist movie that even comes close to the greatness of this slick thriller of a movie. Robert De Niro's Neil McCauley and Al Pacino's Vincent Hanna are riveting to watch. Val Kilmer's extremely cool Chris shiherlis steals the show in some of the movies greatest action scenes. The city of L.A is also captured beautifully; whether it is a heart-racing gun fight on the streets of L.A or a conversation between two guys in restaurant, the city of angels feels like a character of its own.
Thanks to memorable performances, gorgeous cinematography, insane action sequences and a great plot, Heat is the king of its genre and also one of the greatest movies of all time."
"The personal lives of Al Pacino, the cop, and Robert De Niro, the thief, are intertwined in the film as the two literally pursue a cat and mouse game.The film might have been better had there been a common relationship in their lives.We also have violent chase scenes, especially on the street where the shooting doesn't stop, as well as the screaming from the people there.As he is so capable of, Pacino utters a mouthful of profanity in the film. He is on his 3rd marriage, which is troubled along with his young stepdaughter. De Niro, on the other hand, meets a nice girl, who he is ready to involve in his dishonesty, until the last moments of the film.There is much graphic violence and there is a need for a better character development. The meeting between Pacino and De Niro is memorable and soul-searching."
"A few days ago I finally got around to watching the much regarded 1995 'cops and robbers' movie, ""Heat."" I'm not a particular fan of this genre unless it is really well done, but Heat has been on my list of 'Movies to watch' for quite a while. It received high praise from most critics and seemed to have some excellent credentialsLet's face it, a movie starring Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, (two of my all-time favourite actors), along with John Voight, Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Ashley Judd, Natalie Portman and many, many more, could hardly fail. And it didn't – even more so as it was in the hands of one of the masters of the genre, Michael Mann, who wrote and directed it.The film is a whopping 2 hours 46 minutes, but the time just flew by, leaving me begging for more. Heat is undoubtedly one the definitive films of any era and although it was made twenty years ago, it hasn't dated at all and is still eminently watchable. Okay, the cell phones may have been a little on the large side, but that aside, this movie could have been made last year.Al Pacino as the hard-bitten cop on a mission and whose personal life is falling apart, and Robert De Niro – the tough, no-nonsense criminal genius – both play their parts to perfection. These two towering figures of the silver screen are only seen together in two scenes.The first meeting is about half way through the movie, when they enjoy a cup of coffee together. This is a classic confrontation between 'good and evil'; with both of them acknowledging the unstoppable forces that drive them to do what they do. They even have a grudging respect for each other – given the different paths they have chosen in life.The second time they meet is at the end of the movie when we watch the denouement of these two mesmerizing characters played out to the bitter end.Pacino and De Niro are totally 'on song' in this film and Mann has written their parts in a way that allows them to excel in what they do best. The supporting cast, with the likes of Kilmer and Voight (both villains), are a joy to behold and the movie is acted by an ensemble of actors that was taken from the best that Hollywood had to offer in the mid - 90's.Of course, with Mann directing, there is plenty of violence, and a seemingly never-ending shoot-out scene ranks right up there with some of the greatest shoot-outs of all time. To say any more about Heat would spoil the movie for those who haven't yet seen it.Even if you have, it is well worth another looksie after all these years. Go get the DVD or download it. You will NOT be disappointed."
"I just don't understand how this movie can be rated this high on this site. It's generally not that off, but this is ridiculous to have this movie in the top 150 of all time. Just.. no.So let's talk about this movie now. Al Pacino is one of the most overrated actors imho. He did well in The Godfather I&II, and then he lost it. I guess if you would let a barking dog play his role, you could hardly notice the difference. There is no depth to the character, no emotion, no feeling of reality. So that's the good guy.The bad guy is played by de Niro. He plays it ""de Niro"". Nothing really special. He's played this role many times, and he's gonna play it some more. He was OK.And now, the plot. I'm sorry, but this plot is plain stupid. Just the fight scene in the middle of the street, where Val Kilmer kills at least two dozen cops while taking cross-fire from both sides is a sad thing. All through the movie I had the impression that this shouldn't be happening, that is completely implausible, and so on. Yes! I enjoy movies like the Expendables where you KNOW that you don't have to take anything very seriously, and you are watching for the big guns and the crappy one-liners, and the completely, utterly ridiculous action scenes. But this is different. This movie tries to be about characters development and all, and the action scenes are totally misplaced to my perception.Character development. You have more plausible characters in a Walt Disney movie than here. The ending scene where de Niro goes back to the hotel, whereas it is an apparent trap for some girl, betraying his whole personnality, is laughable. Meaning it's just sad. A guy who is supposed to have respected his own rules for his entire life, and who knows this is what got him this far, just acts completely out of character. And this is one of many.The thing that I really hated about this movie is those moments when I was crying out loud in front of my screen thinking ""This can't be true that this should be happening!""I don't recommend this to anyone. That line up is very treacherous, don't be fooled."
"Neil McCauley is a professional crook; he and his crew do very planned and detailed jobs and execute them without error.  Vincent Hanna is a cop who's life revolves around catching criminals with robbery homicide division. One botched job brings these two men into direct confrontation, sparking a cat and mouse game where McCauley's crew wants one last job, regardless of the heat that is being put on them by Hanna.The fact that this film brings with it one of the most anticipated onscreen pairings in recent memory is only the icing on a cake that stands out as one of the best cop thrillers of the 1990's.  Essentially a remake of the much lesser LA Takedown, Mann delivers a story that is a simple tale of two men on the opposite sides of the law who clash heads over one job - each using the skills they have in their field in an attempt to do what they have to do, but only one can succeed.  However this is layered with such great characters that it is difficult not to be impressed - many films would benefit from even half the characters and subplots that this has.If they hadn't worked, then these subplots and side characters would have felt unnecessary and really dragged the film down.  It is to the script's credit that this doesn't happen here and what they actually do is strength and enrich the central narrative and easily fills out the running time. The direction is great - visually the film is impressive and it really uses the streets of LA to good effect; I was really taken by how Mann was able to not only manage that side of things but to also to deliver on the characters as well.  It is not without problems though - and some of the subplots are running for some time before we find out what the point of the character is (most notably in Breedan's cook).  Also some of the threads seem unnecessary and distract - the fact that McCauley's betrayer is also a rapist is a side issue, while Lauren's problems are not dealt with that well.The plot is a solid crime thriller but it is the characters that make it so much better - in particular those of Hanna and McCauley, both of whom are well developed to the point that the audience never sides for one over the other.  The John Woo thread where the two men have admiration for one another is well done but not overdone.Of course a massive boost to the delivery of this dynamic is the pairing of two actors who, regardless of bad spells, are rightly revered as two of the finest of their generation.  Both are on great form here and it is as good a showcase for them as any other film.  It is impossible to say who is better because both are excellent - hell, even Pacino's OTT woo-ha'ing works here! Both bring so much to their performances, using minor facial expressions to convey so much - just look at De Niro as he drives through the tunnel at the end, we don't need to be told his inner thoughts because De Niro lets us see them.  The plot holds back their first meeting and it is worth waiting for - it doesn't overdo it and it proves that less is more.  They both underplay in a scene that lacks fireworks but is immensely satisfying.On top of this the support cast are roundly excellent with the material to work with in most cases.  Kilmer is not great normally but is excellent here, as is Sizemore and a nice role for John Voight.  It may be strange to see Haysbert now that he is famous for 24, but he is good here - even if the relevance of his subplot is less than clear until later.  Fitchtner, Williamson, Levine and Noonan are all good but, if the film has a weak link, then it is in the female characters.  The female cast are good on paper but they aren't given their fair share of the material.  Judd stands out because she is given a decent character but Portman, Venora and the beautiful Brenneman are only really required to fit in the best they can.  In fairness this is a minor compliant as such a rich tapestry was always going to have flaws - especially in such a masculine film.So, yes, this film has the odd weakness - the female roles aren't as strong as the male ones, and some of the subplots require a bit of faith that they will come through, but mostly the film hangs together as one that works superficially, on a basic plot level but also deeper with great characters who have their own lives and are not simply there to say their lines and fill in the background."
"As a long time fan of Heat I keep getting amazed every time I see it. No other crime movie has ever taken the time to build up every character so thoroughly. Even the ultimate bad guy Waingro is not just a shallow character communicating with corny one-liners. Actually so much of the depth of the characters come out through subtle facial expressions, e.g. Diane Venora when Pacino leaves her at the hospital (the camera lingers long enough for her posture to speak a thousand words) Ashley Judd in the couch after signaling to her husband...I hold my breath with her and almost faint every time I see that scene. For gun buffs you gotta love the sound effects of gun fire. For once guns are really loud and not like most movies where people talk calmly to each other while firing guns.The fact that no judgment is passed on the criminal crew or the cops is simply superb. There are no ""good guys"" and ""badguys"" here only complete characters.This is a remake of Mann's earlier L.A. Takedown. A much improved version that is, and I can see why Mann wanted to do this story right. Another thing I love is that Mann pays homage to ""that other great crime movie"" Bullitt. This is apparent in the very end of the movie during the airport chase, a scene that also concludes Bullitt.If Stanley kubric is the master of natural light, then Michael Mann must be the master of artificial and post-processed light. The visual side of Heat is absolutely STUNNING and the soundtrack work in perfect harmony with the images. Ladies and gentlemen, this is art!"
"The thing to strike me about HEAT is that it`s overlong . I don`t know if I`ve been watching too much MTV but a major problem I`ve had with a great number of movies coming out of Hollywood studios since the early 1990s is that they`re too long for their own good and I wish to add HEAT to this list since its running time is taken up with too many unnecessary scenes . If these scenes had been ditched at script stage not only would we have had a shorter film we`d have had a far better one . Take the scene in the coffee bar where the gang have just carried out the initial heist and Neil teaches Waingro a lesson  by banging his head off the table . Seeing as they`re shown throghout the story to be well organised , professional villains why would Neil draw attention to themselves by assaulting Waingro in this way ? It`s a scene that lacks any credibility and should not have been included . There`s another problem with too many domestic scenes , the film tries to show the audience the marital marital/romantic life of every major character , cop and robber . I know Michael Mann`s later movie THE INSIDER is also full of scenes involving home life but that`s necessary to the plot and characterisation . Here it is not HEAT isn`t by any means a bad film , on the contaray it`s a good one . DeNiro and Pacino in the same movie , boy what a casting coup . Not only that we get to see Val Kilmer when he was famous plus up and coming names like Portman , Sizemore and Fichtner , and once the story gets going it is very compelling with a breath taking shootout . Unfortunately because someone ( I`m guessing Michael Mann deserves all the blame for this ) thought they`d stretch out a two hour movie into a three hour one HEAT remains good instead of great"
"I would say if you love crime with mafia movies it is awesome. Addition to that, the Al Pacino and Robert De Niros's acting class are magnificent. Especially, their fist time meeting in the movie "" the table scene"" is legend scene it is the peak of the movie. I really enjoyed the movie and I fully recommend."
"I guess I'm one of the half dozen people in the world who didn't see ""Heat"" when it came out. I read all the gushing critical reviews, but I just never got around to it.Watching it 24 years after its release, it struck me as contrived and cliched, with dialogue that sounds like something out of a bad 1940's gangster movie (""The cops are all over me like a cheap suit."" One guy actually says this! And there many other cringe-worthy lines).The cops and crooks are all alpha males; the women are all brainless bimbos--especially DeNiro's girlfriend who, in spite of being a normal ""civilian,"" decides to stick with him even after she discovers that's he's a thief and a murderer. This is after about two dates. Good choice, lady.To make matters worse, the movie is interminable: two hours and 49 minutes.There's plenty of automatic weapons fire, scores of wrecked vehicles, and many gallons of blood, if you like that kind of thing.Everyone at the time of the film's release was all hyped to see DeNiro and Pacino together as a bad guy and a cop, but to me, there is no chemistry. The one scene in which they meet in a restaurant and talk is promising, but it falls flat. They recite their lines and try to make it convincing, but that particular moment in the film made me realize how little investment they had in these roles. Just two big time actors collecting their paychecks.Just another Hollywood blockbuster with pretensions of greatness. Meh. It passes the time, nearly three very long hours of it."
"People have no idea how to appreciate moves like this anymore. Yes, the pace is slower........... that's the point........ It's an enthralling movie that sucks you in, and then builds, and builds, and builds, to deliver one of the most epic payoffs in cinematic history.But of course people can't handle this story structure anymore. Human attention span continues to dwindle. It doesn't matter if a movie is great, it doesn't matter what masterpiece you craft, if the movie is longer than 2h30 and doesn't have an action scene every 10 minutes, then you've lost the audience.And It's not just the frequency of action, It's the type. Forget anything with a sense of aura and beauty, even the action scenes themselves have to be fast paced, explosions all over the screen, with speedy moving shots that each last half a second, to the point where you actually struggle to even keep up with what's happening, not that anyone cares, because as long as the screen is bright enough and there are enough moving objects, your audience is stimulated.Is it absolutely perfect? no
is it better than 8.2? yessss"
"'Heat' is probably the most stylish realistic action movies of all times. It has been rare throughout cinematic history to get action film that emphasizes the substance as much as pure style. The film's story is so perfectly balanced that it makes the viewers question their morality. Thanks to the superb performances by two of the greatest actors in film, and their charisma along with their on-screen chemistry, it is easy to sympathize with both of them. You just want to Robert DeNiro's Neil get away as much as you want Al Pacino's Vincent to catch him. And what a fantastic group of actors both leads got on their side. It is simply pleasuring to watch such a rich supporting cast. Everything in 'Heat' is in epic proportions, and so is the length of the movie, but it is so masterfully paced that you almost don't notice how three hours are passing. Magnificent and exciting action sequences alternate with moody and emotional quiet scenes. I have to say that when people talk about 'Heat' they usually forget one of the main stars. And this, of course, is the city of Los Angeles."
"If Hollywood ever tried to re-make this movie, the remake would undoubtedly have a lot to live up to the original, because this film is unforgettable and untouchable. From the opening heist to THAT diner scene to that final shot of the film, this hits all the right notes."
"With its incredible direction, acting, and underlying themes this is without a doubt the best heist film put to screen. The payoff of the action is well worth the wait, and the dramatic elements only elevate the stakes of each action scene. One of the only films De Niro and Pacino act along side each other. DON'T MISS THIS ONE!"
"I'm not going to take up much time. This film is the reason why movies are made. Entertaining to its core. The ending sucked for me because I didn't want it to happen that way, but that was all because of the characterizations of the protagonists (Yes, there are two protagonists in this movie). Unbelievable. Go watch it (again)."
"Who on earth would not give this one a perfect 10/10 rating is just beyond me?! I mean the cast, acting, script, directing, plot...whatever is just superb! I for one will enjoy this one again and again...not to mention I watched it in a movie-theater when it came out 23 years ago !"
"This review includes some soft spoilers about the relationships between the characters and some detailed explanation of the synopsis. It is more focused on my sentimental impressions and I do not think it spoils any fun you will possibly have by watching this film.
It's been 4 years since I watched it so i may not remember the vivid details but i clearly remember De Niro's stoic appearence; Sizemore,why can't we see him anymore?; Val Kilmer's 15 minute period of handsomeness in some time 90s and that neo-Nazi Waingro.
It was one of the movies that showed a well-thought action which was fairly new in Hollywood. Actually, action widely meant trade of blows between the protagonist and any henchmen until script demands to continue in that era until there were some attempts to be more detailed like Top Gun with the flight sequences and unfortunately i cannot think of any other example right now. The heist scenes were detailed, organized, and easy to follow to entertain and enjoy them. I like to watch complex and planned things portrayed realistically and any film that manages to do that will be loved and maybe be fanboyed by me.
Wasn't exactly a fan of Al Pacino's overacting but loved the dynamic between him and De Niro. That was the only thing i may criticise but not enough to drop a point.
As i told before loved De Niro's stoic appearance and loved his relationship with the woman. It was beautiful and moving in a film with cold-hearted nature.
Many told it was one of the influences of Dark Knight in its portrayal of heists and in its no-nonsense, never even grinning manner(except Joker). It is a great film to be taken example.
In conclusion, do not be afraid of its running time and watch some skills of this wonderful cast and Michael Mann."
"With Robert Dinero, Al Pachino, Jon Voight and Val Kilmer headlining this movie, Heat is an intense police crime drama which capitalizes on its great screenplay, acting, production and directing. Many police dramas, particularly those of this era, have well developed story lines which fully engage the viewer in the main plot as well as the lives of the main characters. Although, at its core, Heat is a cops and robbers movie, what makes it special is the intensity of the dysfunctional personal relationships which Pachino, Dinero and Kilmer have with the women in their lives, and the cat and mouse game play between Pachino, the L.A. Police Lieutenant brining the ""heat"" to Dinero and his team of technically proficient and professional bank robbers. 
The movie starts, not with a bank heist, but with the heist of bearer bonds from an armored car which results in the death of three guards raising the stakes of the crime from that of armed robbery to homicide for all parties concerned and putting Pachino on their trail. But less about bank robbing and more about the lives of Dinero and Pachino, one of the movies high drama points is when their cat and mouse game results in their meeting over a cup of coffee in a diner. During this meetin Pachino recounts Dinero's criminal resume and stays in the penitentiary, to which Dinero states that he's, ""not going back."" The two also speak candidly about what they each do in terms of chosen professions and how neither of them lives the regular life of ""barbeques and ball games,"" and healthy relationship, and that this is the life they prefer. During this meeting the men share common perspectives on how they feel about what they do, and what they will have to do, even to each other, if it comes to that point. And we know, this point is coming. This scene demonstrates just how good these actors have perfected their crafts, as they convince the viewer that adversaries can have mutual respect for one another.
Heat follows the same pattern of many movies of this type, where we know how this is going to end - in the game of cops and robbers, the cops always win, and the robbers always make mistakes, errors in judgement and betray each other for any number of reasons. In the law and order aspect of the film there are casualties on both sides. But it is the casualties, drama and betrayal in the personal lives of the characters which keeps us glued to our seats. 
As the movie reaches a climax, we see the wreckage coming. Pachino is in pursuit, even as his wife cheats on him and his step daughter attempts to commit suicide. Kilmer's wife seeks to sell him out to the LAPD, and changes her mind, and Dinero who in the process of escaping with his love interest must make a detour to kill one last person who betrayed him. This unplanned, undisciplined reckless and impulsive act we know will lead to Dinero's undoing, as his execution results in police, fire descending upon his location and him leaving the scene of foot with his love interest watching him take off.
The closing scene is a foot chase between cop and robber as Dinero attempts to get to the airport to make meet his connection and make his getaway. The airport scene is unremarkable, as the chase ends with Pachino shooting Dinero. As Dinero lay dying on the ground, Pachino grabs Dinero's hand as Dinero tells him, ""I told you I'm not going back,"" to which Pachino replies, ""yeah.""
If you like classic crime dramas, without all the special effects, shiny objects, stunts and computer graphics, ""Heat"" is for you. Make no mistake about it. As entertaining as ""Heat"" is it is a film of human tragedy. It is the wreckage of human relationships where women pay a significant price for loving the men that they love. It is hard not to feel a women's pain as it front and center in almost every interaction."
"What an awful, awful movie. It is twice as long as it needs to be, for what the actual tired story really is. There are soooo many tangling plot lines that are never tied together, and some are frankly quite interesting. Al Pacino's character has an interesting ""relationship"" with his 3rd wife, and Natalie Portman's character is having severe problems, but she's only in a few scenes and we don't learn what ultimately happens to her.To invest 3 hours in at least a dozen characters and to come away with nothing.....unreal! Even at such a length there are leaps in the action. And I was quite bored. If I hadn't rented it, I would not have sat through the entire thing. If it were on TV, I would have shut it off after a half-hour.There's no doubt the cast is first-class, but they are wasted in one of the most overrated, predictable and boring films I've ever seen."
"9.6Has there ever been a moment in your life where you found yourself battling hesitation, or having to make a difficult choice? If so, and that decision was ever to see the movie Heat or not, let me take the burden off your shoulders. Watch this movie.Coming into this, I wasn't expecting much. I figured, sure, a crime movie. Great cast... Michael Mann behind the camera. It has to be pretty good. At least everyone says it is. It's better than that. This is one of those films where I have to erase everything that I knew or thought I knew about it per what everyone else told me, or according to the general opinion about it. Then I have to watch the movie myself, and let every single scene soak in. Heat is essentially a cops and robbers story. You experience the story from both points of views. You see the families of both sides. The good, and the hard times. The initiatives, incentives, and personalities behind both lifestyles. Then it melts them both together. You think, ""yeah, these men are performing horrible acts, and overall bad choices"", but you start to care about them as human beings. You want the good guys to win, but at the same time you don't want to see the others fail. There's one scene in particular which brings both worlds together. It's as if the cop and the robber went out for a cup of coffee.I'm not going to say much about the acting. After all, these are men who act, and don't talk much. ""Stop talking, okay, Slick"", a robber tells another in the beginning of the film. They get things done and don't really show much emotion while on the job. Al Pacino seasons the detective's role with the salt that he usually brings to the table. Mostly though, what you have here is a story with down to earth characters and down to earth performances.The directing is phenomenal. Michael Mann and crew manage to bring tension to the right scenes, adrenaline where its needed, and just about every other emotion the film brings out at just the right time. The movie slows down and speeds up exactly when it needs to. The use of ambient sound and music is great here. Sometimes I couldn't determine what was an effect, what was music and what was ambiance. There are some shots that are close ups of peoples faces and the emotions on them that are of my favorite scenes in the movie. The movie goes from low-key conversations to high speed shootouts. Tactful scrutiny to emotional outbursts. And never misses a beat.This movie, or maybe I should say film, gives you everything that you'd expect from a crime movie, yet offers so much more. It doesn't glorify crime or the background processes of it. It unveils the people behind it instead, and makes you think about what type of people do these things. They are not good people, that's for sure. But you can't help but think that their skills could have been put to better use. Maybe as detectives, the other side of the crime. Still, you're just going to have to forget about everything that I just said, as well as forget about what you've heard about this movie, and go watch it for yourself. It stands apart from the rest."
"I have to say this is my favourite movie of all time. The acting is superb and the cast is great. De Nero and Pacino were great going face to face. It didn't seam like a De Nero and Pacino were chosen purely for getting butts on theatre seats like a recent movie I watched (cant remember the title and it was bad). Both main actors played their roles superbly.The supporting cast was also excellent. I never really care about actors names so I wont go into details. Yet De Nero's crew were great as well as Pacino's force colleges.The thing that I like the most about this movie is the fact its got a bit of everything. Action, drama, romance etc. It doesn't just focus on the main plot yet also explores the characters enough and gives ample time to get connected with them. You see their personal lives, their dreams, dedication to what they do etc.I guess a lot of people thought the movie was too long yet I wouldn't have minded if it were another hour. Every part was necessary IMO to get the viewer involved and get them to feel what the characters are feeling the best they could. You just don't get movies like this any more. Quick action and straight to the point seams to be today's theatre. I guess I enjoy stretched out movies due to the old westerns I watches growing up. The ones where you'd watch 3 henchmen at a train station for 10 minutes before anything happened.Heat is one of them movies I wished just kept going... I personally would have liked to have seen De Nero get away at the end to leave it open for a sequel. Yet I believe the ending was for the best as sequels usually screw a movie over (except the Godfather, Rocky until IV).The dialogue was great. I loved the way Pacinos character interacted with people. The no bullshit approach, anything to get the job done.I just didn't really like the fact that the Waingro character got away at the beginning. Surely De Neros crew would have been professional enough not to let him escape, even when being distracted by the cop car.The soundtrack was also suburb. I used to be a Moby fan and I like the way the movie integrated at least two of his less popular tracks.Lastly I enjoyed the side stories, particularly the one where the crew go after Van Zant.To sum it up, I love this movie. Every year at least one I sit down with a nice meal, some fine alcoholic beverage and enjoy. Now that I'm married I'll probably need to do it on a day my wife isn't home so I can enjoy uninterrupted.I'll have to see if this movie is available on Blue-Ray when I purchase a PS3. I just had a look at the soundtrack price on ebay AU whist typing this and it still averages $20"
"Acted to perfection, rich in character traits, taut direction,... these words simply never can do this film justice.What began as a simple tale of cops and robbers suddenly develops into insightful and poignant characterization, the boundaries between good and evil, and facing up to one's demons. Yes, not only did this film deliver by the thrills, it gave us, the audience, an in depth look at the lives of two equal men who work on opposite sides of the law, and how their routines affect them, in the city of Los Angeles.First off, I would like to say that the acting in this movie is extremely well. You really emphasize with the characters and, for some, fell a sort of sympathy towards them. Kudos to Pacino and De Niro for playing the dedicated detective and disciplined thief, respectively. Both these men are exceptionally excellent actors and in this film, their acting is done to perfection. Without them, the film is nothing. Notable performances in the film: Val Kilmer, Natalie Portman, Diane Venora, Amy Brenneman, and of course the lovely Ashley Judd.For the cinematography, I must say that Dante Spinotti has done a tremendous job with the scenery. The city of LA has never looked this wide or gritty until this film. The nighttime scenes and the helicopter flybys of the film are stunning to watch, as it majestically captures a sparkling portrait of Los Angeles set against an urban world.To accompany the cinematography, the music by Elliot Goldenthal is unforgettable. Especially the arrangements with the Kronos Quartet. It really adds to the entire atmosphere and theme of the movie.Kudos to director/writer Michael Mann. The direction is taut (as mentioned earlier) and whip-smart, the story fantastically evolving and original, and the screenplay is well-written. The action scenes were extremely well-handled, and is kinetic and heart pounding, and best - and most important of all, realistic. This is what makes it stand out from the rest of the other crime films - they tend to put in moments of Deux Ex Machina, such as the police knowing every trick up the crooks' sleeve - but not this film. It's good, because Mann is dedicated to show both sides of the cop vs. criminal story, and he succeeds with masterful results. From this film and Collateral, I can tell he is a skilled and dedicated filmmaker when it comes to crime thrillers. By the time the film ends you won't even know three hours have passed.In short, this film is nothing short of a masterpiece. It will stand the test of time for many, many years to come. If you manage to see it in a store, or while channel-surfing, do yourselves a favor and watch it. If you consider a fan of Pacino and/or De Niro, watch it. If you are crime movie fan, action fan or even a movie buff, you MUST watch it. I assure you readers, you will never get disappointed by this film.9.994/10Delton."
"What passes for epic cinema these days can be found in Heat, a noisy, bombastic, self reverential cops and robbers bore that between gun battles drags for most of it's three hour (yes three) running time.Detective Vin Hanna (Al Pacino) is a standout cop with almost as many bad marriages as commendations. Neil MacCauley (Robert DiNero) is a career criminal always bent on the big score. Both men are very methodical and take great pride in their professionalism. After botching a brinks job Hanna pursues the gang which is beginning to fray at the edges. Mac Cauley realizes it's tough to get good help these days and decides on one last score before calling it quits.Showcasing the biggest meeting since Truman met Stalin at Potsdam director Michael Mann treats the first meeting of Pacino and DiNero together (both were in Godfather 2 but appeared in no scenes together) with the same solemnity as the two actors wheeze through their moment. With nothing new or revelatory to say, they show manly respect and understanding for each other. The problem is the scene is more about these closely identified highly regarded actors than the characters they play. Their star wattage (as well as their skills) may have dimmed by 95 but their legendary status carried a lot of weight. It's about as interesting as two old codgers reminiscing on an old folks home porch and rings hollow like the rest of this lumbering elephant of a film.The convoluted plot is filled with forgettable characters but it does allow Mann to wander around LA spreading gratuitous violence. The women in the film are relegated to looking tired and concerned over their boy friends, acting as sounding boards for the guys to spew their Mannly philosophy about honor and being true to your skills.The action scenes are big, loud, bloody, poorly edited and ridiculous as LA empties out to let the boys shoot it out in grand fashion on the streets. The badly paced montage of Al and Bobby dashing up and down the avenues with some very big weapons (size is everything to Mann)playing cops and robbers runs out of steam before they run out of bullets.By the time they made Heat Pacino and DiNero had peaked before doing self parody (though Pacino would go on to give a stellar performance worthy of his early years as Roy Cohn in Angels in America) and it shows in their lackluster tired performances magnified even further by the film stealing effort turned in by Val Kilmer as gang member Chris. Kilmer's energy and the self confident way he moves and acts delivers the passion the two stars lack.As in some of his other films Mann explores the theme of moral relativism with usual heavy handed pretension attempting to bestow nobility on the good as well as the bad, solemnizing the whole ponderous affair with Elliot Goldenthal's vapid score that is more appropriate for a coronation than a shoot'em up.In Heat MacCauley states ""Never have anything in your life that you can't walk out of in thirty seconds flat"". One should keep this in mind before watching this big helium balloon of hot air."
"Heat is far more than just a standard 'cops and robbers' drama. For a movie like that, see Michael Bay's movies. Lifeless, full of one-liners, standard. From the mold. And that's everything Michael Mann doesn't do.Unbelievably shot in L.A (using not one sound stage), Heat shows exactly what life in L.A looks like. The tinted blue, the dark, but beautiful nights of L.A. Michael Mann created one of the most perfect visual masterpieces I've ever seen.However, it isn't only the incredible look to the film, but the story and the all-star cast. There are no slackers here, not when you unite two of the best actors in cinematic history. Al Pacino is over-the-top, incredible, and in one of his finest roles to date. Robert de Niro is at his finest, playing the cool, quiet and lonely Neil. Both create some incredible scenes, both eerie and powerful. Even Val Kilmer doesn't look out of place here, and holds his own with the two screen giants.The script was perfect, layered with thousands of intricate details. At almost three hours, the movie is lengthy, however I would have wanted more. The amount of character development in this film is unprecedented, with Mann carefully showing the viewer exactly how the person would be in real life.Heat is by far leagues ahead of any other cops vs. robbers movie made to date. Why? Because it doesn't get stuck in that mind frame. Instead, Mann sculpts the stories of many different people's lives, all unified by their drive to get what they want. Mann did a stand-out job, and this film definitely deserves a solid 11/10."
"When I saw the cast, I thought it must be a good movie, but I remained disappointed, De Niro and Pacino were average, as well as the whole movie. There are thousands of such a movies, this one is nothing special, neither good nor bad, just average. Another in a series of stupid action movies, with boring plot and unrealistic events. I do not understand how it can be among the top 150. So people, if you want to watch it, DO NOT, you will be disappointed and you will lose three hours of your precious time. The only good thing was the discovery of young Natalie Portman, who has shown that she can act and that she will be a great actress, with a respectable career."
This movie is in my top 10 all time favorites. It's score is 7.9. id give it a 10. its also only 245 in the top 250 movies of all time list. It definitely beats a lot of the movies which beat It's 7.9 score. This movie is great and perfect. I see nothing that should make it only 7.9. you have to agree it should at least be a 9 and closer to 1 then 245. everything in it is perfect. The movie is perfect. it makes me made that its not rated higher. De Niro and Pacino are great in it and its one of their better movies. It's nice and dramatic. This is all just my opinion on the movie. what is yours. And what would you rate it for its score and in the top 250.
"When this movie was originally shot there were scenes where Det. Hanna (Pacino) was doing cocaine. When he was outside the club about to go in to meet Tone Loc (Albert's brother) the bouncer outside gives him a vial, on the house, and he takes a snort of if as he goes in. There are several times throughout the movie were it seems like Pacino is over acting. This is because he was supposed to be wired. However, Mann decided the movie was intense enough without this story line and cut all of the scenes out. I spoke with someone who went to a program where Michael Mann spoke about movie making and mentioned this. Also, if you get a hold of some of the early drafts of the screenplay you can read these scenes in them."
"I'm watching this, on cable, for about the tenth time.  It's STILL amazing, and totally engaging.  How many films can you say that about?Every member of the cast is perfect.  The plot sucks you in and never lets go, and there's nary a car chase nor explosion to be found!  (how refreshing.)One of my top twenty favs of all time. No need to add more, as other reviewers have pretty much covered it."
"You people are either brainwashed, or just plain ignorant to what constitutes great cinema.. First of all, 3 hour bank heist epics should never be made, period..Secondly, cut out every scene with a woman in it, save for the one with the stand in get away driver and his wife discussing the struggles of staying clean, and away from crime... The women are utterly useless to the overall story, and ruin the pace of the film..Third... The ""Waingro"" storyline was laughable... If these guys are such ""pros,"" then why are they trying to whack this guy in a very public Diner parking lot?... This, after making a scene in the diner, assuring dozens of witnesses..And finally... The scene between Pacino and DeNiro... Completely forced, and doesn't further the story, at all (which is actually the point of scene construction... The telling of the story).. And not to be picky, but that would never happen in real life, either (which isn't such a big deal, until you compound it with all the other flaws in the movie)..Overall, the most overrated movie of the 90's... Easily.."
"I remember watching this when it first came out in th 90's and saying wow!
Twenty plus years later and it's every bit as good and one of my all time top five movies.
Brilliant movie, equally brilliant performances. The scene where Pacino and De Niro share a coffee whilst one persues the other, will go down as one of the all time greats.
Just love everything about it!!"
"(There are Spoilers) Overlong and mindless crime drama that has to do with this master bank robber Neil McCauley, Robert De Niro, who becomes the object of L.A police Let. Vincent Hanna's, Al Pacino, obsession, The two get involved in a battle of wits and bullets that turns the city of Las Angeles into Baghdad Iraq by the time the movie ""Heat"" is finally over. Inolved in a number of high profile robberies Neil has become a bit soft in his life long career in crime. Neil is planing to pull off just one more multi-million dollar bank robbery and then call it quits and retire.Let.Hanna on McCauley's tail want's to prevent him from pulling off his grand slam bank holdup but is always stymied as McCauley is one step ahead of him. Even though after the first armor car robbery, that resulted in the three armor car guards getting shot to death by McCauley & Co., all McCauley and his gang did was do each other in. As well as being, or trying to be, double-crossed by big time mob money launderer Roger Van Zant,William Fichtner, who's over one million dollars in untraceable Bearer Bonds the McCauley gang took in the armor car robbery and attempted to sell back to him at .60 on the dollar. This after Van Zant got back all the money that he lost in stolen bonds back which were covered by his insurance company.Were then bombarded with both McCauleys and Hannas personal life that goes on for almost an hour like a day time TV soap opera and really has very little to to with the movie's basic theme about crime and punishment in the streets and airport of L.A. All that confuses and bores you to the point that your almost put to sleep watching it.Who cares about Hanna's relationship with his old lady Justine, Diane Venora, and who she sleeps with! Even Let. Hanna doesn't seem too concerned he's only angry that Justine's lover Ralph, Xander Berkeley, has the nerve to watch his TV set and couldn't care less if he slept with Justine or not. Det. Hanna's step-daughter Lauren, Natelie Portman, is so upset over his and her moms bickering that she attempts to kill herself. Lauren does this by slashing her wrists and then trying to drown herself in her step-fathers apartments bathtub.McCauley also gets involved with this young graphic designer Eady, Amy Brenneman, but it's so out of character for him that it leads to his ultimate demise at the end of the movie. McCauley juggling between Eady's going along with him, to heaven knows where, in his attempted escape from being captured by the police at the L.A Airport and then going out of his way to murder Wangro, Kevin Gage, at the airport hotel that's crawling with L.A policemen. Wangro who was involved in the opening scene armor car robbery was later kicked out of McCauly's gang, and almost killed by him. Yet how did Wangro somehow seems to have gotten a hold of McCauley's later plans to rob a midtown L.A bank? it's never explained what and how Wangro knew about the impending bank robbery since he was totally out of the loop when it was planned and later executed! And what exactly had Wangro's later involvement with the Van Zant mob have to do with him informing on McCauley's plans to the police?There's also Jon Voight as this big mob honcho Nat who looks like General Custer at the Little Big Horn. Voight pops up every now and then in the movie, giving McCauley advice that's always on target, but who's part in the film is never really explained by the script writers. As well as not clarifying the story behind the Shiherlis' Chris & Charlene, Val Kilmer & Ashley Judd. The wacky couples zany and bizarre relationship soon threatens to screw up all of McCauley's plans for his last big score. Chris gets badly shot up in the L.A bank robbery and looks like he's about to die from his wounds but then what seems like only hours later he shows up, with a new haircut, totally recovered! Chris also comes up with a new identity that was so convincing that even Let. Hanna and the LAPD had to let him go free! This after he was involved in the deaths of at least a dozen innocent people and L.A policemen that afternoon!We earlier saw Charlene give Chris some kind of hand signal as the L.A police were about to pinch him, in a sting they set up for him. But all Chris did was turn around in his car and drive out of sight and like magic he was immune from prosecution?The movies ridicules ending was about as exciting as a game of chess. Both Let. Hanna and his rival and adversary in the movie Neil McCauley are seen running for what seemed like the length of the Boston Marathon all around L.A Airport and it's surroundings. This was all done I suspect so those of us, still awake and waiting to see the big showdown between the two, could finally switch the channel and get back to watching something that makes more sense and is far more interesting; like the Saturday Morning Cartoons."
"I was recommended to watch this movie. Now I wonder whether this even is a movie. Is it an insane fantasy? Is it a collection of clichés; the thoughtful gangster and the cool police chef - not to forget all the beautiful women who share the role of the loving wife and girlfriend? Who are the characters that are introduced and suddenly disappear again? Why are we presented with the entire background of the cook/driver who dies within one minute? What is up with the daughter, that tries to kill herself, for no reason whatsoever? Michael Mann has no idea how to create sympathy for his characters, nor does he know how to convey emotions or give insight to the human psyche. The plot is yet endurable, compared to the filmic devices. The cuts are dreadful, unnecessary scenes are emphasized,important scene miss completely, the setting lacks design (Mr.Mann simply wanted to film L.A at night), the dialogue is grotesque and superficial - and does the role of Pacino have a dangerously high blood pressure or why is he permanently swearing and shouting like a prolet? The characters lack depth, especially their relationships are cliché-like and absolutely hollow. Cinematically, the film has no structure, it is a slap in the face. I recommend you to not watch this film, unless you want to have a good laugh with your friends."
"The film is very unengaging. Frankly I wouldn't have cared if the entired cast had died/ gone to prison/ anything else, really. It felt like it lasted forever. Relationships between the characters were unreal. No idea how this has such a high rating. No idea at all."
"The praises bestowed on this film by critics and IMDb users and the pious references to the leads' ""conversation over coffee"" scene is a sign of the powerful grip that Robert De Niro and Al Pacino hold on the attention and minds of movie-goers, and the places in pop culture that they have grabbed a hold of. But after seeing all of those dreamy-eyed comment titles in the index for this movie, I just thought I'd bring to mind a few reasons why this film is by no means as good as they come.**spoilers**The cop-and-crook chase ending is a ""cop-out"" ~~ Yawn. A shootout is really just an arbitrary way to end the story. So McCauley got shot and killed. Whatever. What if Hanna had been the one to get hit? Instead of a moving scene that has a relevant connection to the plot as a whole, the viewer is given a trite shootout that only seems concerned with upholding the film tradition of ""Good Guy outfights Bad Guy so the movie can end"". It even features Hanna failing to call for backup on his cellular phone so Pacino can look even more heroic, and afterwards it shows De Niro slowly slumping to the ground as he expires. This does nothing dramatically.Implausibility ~~ The writers seem to have been so preoccupied with conveying an ""epic"" sensation that they didn't polish up on the little (and not so little) details that detract from a movie if left unpolished. Some of them have already been discussed by other commenters. But ""Heat"" has plenty more to bother you.So Van Zant has not only failed to rub out McCauley, but has received vengeful death threats from him over the phone, too. Does he grab his riches and some bodyguards and hide out somewhere? No, he just sits in his mansion (with no security system, apparently) all alone in his bathrobe and watches the hockey game on TV, almost waiting for McCauley to waltz in, kill him, and walk away unharmed.Then we are supposed to believe that the cautious, carefully-planning McCauley would give up his chance to make a clean getaway just to extract some revenge from Waingrow, who has inexplicably gone from staying in cheap motels to renting luxury hotel suites. Let's ignore for a minute the fact that this public enemy could actually stroll into a big hotel, through the kitchens and laundry rooms, and through the lobby without being stopped and recognized, not even as an outsider in an employees-only area. He actually pulls the fire alarm for a distraction while he carries out his execution. Surely even he would have expected traffic jams, stampedes, firetrucks, and cops 'a plenty to arrive, making a quiet exit impossible.Poor sense of scene ~~ The director is too caught up in extreme close-ups to let the viewer breath and get a feel for the settings. The result: claustrophobia and tedium. With all those big mugs filling up the screen, I would have been overwhelmed if I had seen this in the theater.Histrionics ~~ I've accepted Pacino in some of his other films, but his raise-my-voice tough guy routine is tired here. It doesn't help that he has to shout moronic lines like ""Women's ***!!!!"" complete with hand gestures. Of course, this fits in with the absurdity of the dialogue overall. The film is another example of actors awkwardly reciting heavy, moralistic paragraphs, instead of characters behaving normally. We even get slow zoom-ins on the actors' faces so we can be told when the Important and Moving Drama is taking place. ""You don't live with me, you live among the remnants of dead people. You sift through the detritus, you read the terrain, you search for signs of passing, for the scent of your prey ... and then you hunt them down."" Um, I thought the filmmakers were aiming for ""realism"", not melodrama. And since when has anyone ever used the word ""detritus"" in a conversational sentence?Add to all that a flat pseudo-classical/rock soundtrack and considerable length.and you wind up with a pretentious, unimpressive, undistinguished movie with a couple of big names on the poster."
