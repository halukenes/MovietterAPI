"Reservoir Dogs is the debut of director and writer Quentin Tarantino. It stars Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, and Lawrence Tierney. Tarantino has a minor role, as does criminal-turned-author Eddie Bunker.It feels a bit silly to write it now, but there was a time when Reservoir Dogs barely made a ripple in the cinema loving world; in America that is. Upon its release in the States it was moderately successful and comfortably made back its $1.2 million budget. However, upon hitting the British shores it was a big hit and grossed nearly £6.5 million and then Pulp Fiction exploded on the world in 94 and Reservoir Dogs got reappraised in its home country. The rest as they say is history.Tarantino, the most enthusiastic of film fans, was once a video store clerk in Redondo Beach. There he dreamed of making his own movies and planned to make Reservoir Dogs with his friends on a relatively small budget. As luck would have it, Keitel got hold of the script and wanted in. With his name attached, and using his contacts, a serious budget was raised and so the Dogs were set loose. At the time of its popularity, Tarantino had to guardedly fend off accusations of plagiarism and a charge of just hacking from older classic heist movies. His argument was that he was making his own homage to the heist caper, but even so, the fact remains that Reservoir Dogs is spliced from The Killing, Kansas City Confidential, The Big Combo, The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three and we can definitely throw in The Asphalt Jungle as well.Yet Reservoir Dogs is still extraordinarily fresh and vibrant, raising the bar for crime movies in the modern era. Tarantino of course has since gone on to prove his worth with other projects, so in truth his homage movie was merely the foot in the door for the talented son of Knoxville, Tennessee. In terms of its dialogue, tho, and its gleeful use of ""ultra-violence,"" it has few peers. From any decade. It also helps considerably that Tarantino has assembled a quality cast to make his non-linear classic shine. Keitel is a given, but Roth is exceptional, as too is Buscemi, while Madsen is frighteningly convincing as psycho for hire Mr. Blonde. Then there's the 70s soundtrack, a vital part of the narrative as we hear the dulcet tones of Steven Wright Djing on K-Billy's Super Sounds of the Seventies. If you have not seen the film yet? Then I promise you will remember Stealers Wheel-Stuck in the Middle for the rest of your cinema loving days.And that's the thing with Reservoir Dogs, it's crammed packed full of memorable things. A quip, a bang, a song or the WTF ending, as homages go; it's one of the very best. 9/10"
"Tarantino's brutal debut film. From the original initial dialogue, to the final outcome, the director astonishes everyone and makes clear his style: anthological dialogues (pay attention to the discussion in the distribution of colors that will identify each gangster, hilarious) a breakthrough structure, very good soundtrack (as in all his films), great doses of violence (although not at all gratuitous, but rather ironic) and, above all, a lot of black humor. In addition to superb performances by Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi and Chris Penn. In short, a great example of good noir cinema (with all its ingredients: shootings, violence, betrayal, suspense, etc.), but with the innovative and very personal touch of the brilliant director, who would later continue to dazzle with the wonderful ""Pulp Fiction"". Oh, and the scene from the beginning with ""Little Green Bag"" is legendary. 10/10"
"Reservoir Dogs is a testament to the idea that ""less is more."" This doesn't apply to the violence, the film is extremely violent from beginning to end, but the details of the botched diamond heist, which the entire film is based on, are conveyed only in the dialogue, except for one scene where Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) recalls his escape. The whole film takes place after the failed robbery is over, and the mystery that unfolds among the criminal participants is amazing to watch. This is not a normal crime film. The thing that really sets Reservoir Dogs apart from all of the others is that it is PURE. When you look at the screen, you're looking at reality. There are no Hollywood actors, there's no make-up to make them look pretty, there's little to no comic relief, and most important of all, there's no goofy romantic subplot clumsily thrown in, a detrimental trademark of so many action films, as well as  virtually all Jerry Bruckheimer films. Instead of all of that garbage, Tarantino decided to just present the film as simply and straightforwardly as possible, and by doing that he makes it seem that you're really looking at a bunch of criminals trying to figure out what to do after a suspiciously failed robbery. Even though most of the actors were known at the time this film was made, the film was delivered in such a way that you don't see the actors at all, you only see the brutal characters that they portray. It is genuinely frightening to imagine being in the same room with any of them, and this is a quality that is rarely achieved in any kind of film.
Make no mistake, Reservoir Dogs is among the most violent films ever made, and some scenes are really painful to watch, but the way that reality is captured is something that justifies the violent excesses in this film. The violence is never glorified, nor is the criminal lifestyle. When films are overly violent, they usually get branded as such, but despite the extreme violence, Reservoir Dogs still manages to deliver an important overall message about the consequences of your actions. It remains high on the growing list of Tarantino's classic films, and it will not be soon forgotten."
"From the opening moments of ""Reservoir Dogs"" you sense that you are watching a different kind of crime drama.  The style and dialog of this picture bestows a level of intelligence upon it's characters that defies the reality of their chosen profession.  Having said that,this movie is absolutely riveting in it's movements from the ordinary, to the grim, to the horrific aspects of a career criminal.  Quintin Tarantino has written a tale of an almost corporate order to constructing a crime gang.  The delight is in meeting these characters one by one.  The particular crime is no more crucial to the film than a 7-11 stick-up.  The crux of the movie is the portrayal of the rainbow of characters who find themselves involved in a life of crime.  Much has been made of the violence in the movie, but it only serves to point out that all men are different......even the crooked.  The director has included a number of very memorable scenes.  This is not a linear film.  The movie works more as a series of set pieces that weave together a story that is not as important as the individual parts that you have the pleasure of observing.  This movie may take more than one viewing to truly appreciate."
"The first time I saw Reservoir Dogs, I was about 15, it had been banned in my country, and I heard it was extremely voilent. Naturally I did everything in my power to get my paws on a copy, and when I finally did see it, I was disappointed. I was just sitting there saying ""Wheres all the violence"", Anyway, I watched it till the end, and then I watched it again, and since then it has just grew on me.This is one of the movies I don't get bored watching time and time again. I still watch it at least once a year, because its not the kind of movie you watch to unwind or to pass the time. You simply watch it for the sheer quality and originality of the movie. The one liners are classic: ""Are you gonna bark all day..."", ""I'll make you my dog's bitch"". Mr.Blonde is totally believable as a psycho. I mean who stops to get fries and soda just after committing a robbery? The fact that everything is ludicrous, but you don't know this because these guys, and the way they talk is so impossibly cool that you just accept it. This movie is all about the dialog. The violence is used sparingly, and to better effect. The way the film is edited is genius. Its almost like you forget the whole movie after you watch it, and the next time you watch it, there's a whole scene that you forgot was there. The storyline is unpredictable and thrilling. This is better that Pulp Fiction and in my opinion definitely Tarintino's best movie. I didn't care much for the ""Kill Bill"" movies, but who cares, I'm not reviewing them.If you haven't seen Reservoir Dogs, just rent it, buy it or steal it right now."
"A couple of weeks ago, I was blessed with a rare opportunity. one of the movie theaters in town did a midnight showing of this. Naturally, being a ""Dogs"" freak, I went down and saw it.To say I was blown away would be an understatement. I have only seen two of Mr. Tarantino's films in the theater. This being one, and ""Kill Bill"" being the other. I only became a fan of his a year ago and have subsequently seen all of his films and own them all.It really was a treat to be able to sit in the movie theater and watch this while eating grossly overpriced popcorn and drinking a grossly overpriced soda.For those who don't know, the film involves a jewelry heist. Six strangers including Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi, Eddie Bunker, Tarantino himself, and Tim Roth are recruited by a crime boss named Joe Cabot, (Lawrence Tierney) and his son Eddie, whom everybody calls ""Nice Guy"" (Chris Penn). The six are almost all friends or associates of Cabot, particularly Keitel and Madsen. Cabot gives them colors for names (Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Pink, Mr. Blue, etc.) And expressly forbids them to reveal anything about themselves to each other, so if anyone is caught, no one can inform on anybody. But the heist goes wrong, the cops seem to show up way to fast, some members of the group are killed, and the rest start returning to the rendesvous point to try to sort out what went wrong. After the arrival of Mr. Pink, They realize that one of the number is a police informer. The arrival of Mr. Blonde, and the present he has in his trunk, complicates things even more. Things are also complicated by the fact that since no one knows each other, discovering who the informer is is given added difficulty, since no one trusts each other.This film, Tarantino's first, is one of the best, if not the best one he has ever done. but part of this credit has to go to his outstanding cast. Keitel is an old pro at this type of thing, he has the distinction of being the first older actor who's career seemed to be going into a slump and who has recovered thanks to Tarantino's casting. But Tarantino can't claim sole credit for that, because Keitel really got the ball rolling on the project and help him score his budget and the prominence to gain his cast. Buscemi IS Mr. Pink. Tarantino wrote the role for himself, and he would have been good, but Buscemi brings a type of weasly professionalism to the role that no one else could. Penn and Tierney are ideally cast as the father and son who are left to sort out the mess of the robbery, Bunker is only in a few scenes but livens up the proceedings. Tarantino gives himself the perfect monologue for his character (Like a Virgin is a metaphor for big d*cks), and Tim Roth gives a spectacular performance as Mr. Orange, who is relegated to bleeding on the floor for a large chunk of the movie. His scene in the car when he has just been shot is particulary outstanding. But then, of course, I have to throw out a special nod to my favorite character in the piece, Mr. Blonde, as portrayed by Michael Madsen. Blonde is the definition of ""Bad*ss"", and Madsen fits him like a glove. His first scene back at the warehouse is particularly memorable, as is the ""Ear torture sequence"". Without Madsen's portraying of Mr. Blonde, I don't think the ""Ear"" scene would have worked, Madsen just does something with it that nobody else can. Not only does Blonde have most of the coolest lines, he's fun to watch on screen, especially his reaction to a gun pointed in his face by Mr. White. Madsen rocks!""Dogs"" Is one of the few movies where I don't think thae casting could have been any better. Part of the reason it works as well as it does has to go the the way the cast works with each other. No one seems to think that they are better than anyone else, and no one seemed to approach the project with the stuck up feeling of how bad it was that they were doing an indie film on a low budget and with an unknown director. Every single member of the cast gives everything he (or, to a much lesser extent, she) has. It's this mindset that, I think, has made ""Dogs"" the classic it is today. Little could be improved upon.As a side note, This came out a year after ""Thelma and Louise"" which also stars Harvey Keitel and Michael Madsen. However, in ""Dogs"" They play ruthless characters. In ""T&L"" they play the only sympathetic Male characters in the entire movie. An ideal would be to watch ""T&L"" then ""RD"" and really see the difference. They are two great actors, and they deliver. And for those who enjoyed Madsen in this, I also recommend ""Kill Me Again"", made a few years earlier, and which also features a scene where he tortures someone.""Dogs"" is a great film to watch. Not a date flick, but for a cops and robbers movie, it's perfect. Seeing it for the first time in a theater, it hasn't lost it's touch, and the ""Stuck in the Middle with You""/Ear sequence has never been more intense or memorable.*****/***** !0/10"
"This is without a doubt one of the best movies I've ever seen and definately deserves its position on the Top 250. It's an acquired taste, but if you've been desensitised to violence (as i have), then you will want to watch this again from the minute it ends. Every single actor was perfectly fitted for its character. Steve Buscemi as the squirrely Mr. Pink, Harvey Keitel as the veteran Mr. White, and of course, Michael Madsen as the phsycotic Mr. Blonde. The list goes on and on.Some people said that the violence was unnecessary and didn't move the plot forward as it did with Pulp Fiction. I agree, but the violence was used to develop the character's personalities. It showed their disregard for human life and that our anti-heros saw killing a cop as being as stepping on a cockroach .I urge future viewers of this movie not to instantly compare it to Pulp Fiction and enjoy it as it's own film. An interesting thrill-ride crime drama from beginning to end, I give this film *****/*****"
"Bloodily violent, irreverently shocking, politically incorrect, inventively funny and so on and so forth I'm trying to find the right expression to describe ""Reservoir Dogs"" and I finally got it, it stands in three letters: N-E-W. There was something waiting in the abyssal wombs of cinema, so repressed it was waiting for deliverance with a fierce impatience, a deliverance with a quite original and cool-sounding name: Quentin Tarantino, the new incarnation of modern violence with STYLE. ""Reservoir Dogs"" is more than a debut; it's a sensational entrance that consecrated Tarantino among the most influential directors of his generation, and THE reference in independent film-making.Tarantino invented a new style that would never desert his films, and would make each of his creation, the epitome of coolness. It's so fresh to watch ""Reservoir Dogs"" now and to realize how new it was at that time. I remember the first time I watched the film, I was 17, and the movie literally blew me away in every single aspect, and I guess the fact that I wasn't familiar with the Internet or IMDb was a good thing since it didn't intercede with my approach of the film. I didn't want to know what's so cool about Tarantino, I just discovered him with his film, shortly after watching ""Pulp Fiction"", and for some reason, I loved ""Reservoir Dogs"" a little more. Tarantino quickly became my favorite director as a teenager, and in my early 20's because of this level of creativity in the writing, the directing, and the editing.The writing is Tarantino's trademark and his greatest quality, the movie starts with a whole discussion about the meaning of ""Like a Virgin"" told by a fast-speaking Tarantino, himself as Mr. Brown, then a whole debate starts about tipping and non tipping. That's the question raised by the first minutes of ""Reservoir Dogs"" and the least we could say is that the talk is so trivial it sounds real and authentic in its rawness and makes the characters more human, if not sympathetic. More generally, the whole characterization is driven by dialogs so delicately vulgar you never miss the action, or wait for something 'to happen'. Script 'happens' in Tarantino's films, like meals you've already eaten but with a new special taste, something juicy, creamy, and spicy. It's almost an indigestion of creativity  I don't need to tell you the lines, if I start them, you know the rest : ""You shoot me in a dream "", ""Are you gonna bark all day, little doggie?"" etc. etc. And these dogs not only bark, but they do bite a lot.Indeed, if the movie was all dialogs, it wouldn't have had the same impact. It's like Tarantino already knew his lesson, and wanted to make something big, from the beginning. From the iconic slo-mo walking scene down the alley with the opening credits, you get the idea that this ""Little Green Bag"" song will be the 'hallelujah' glorifying the birth of a new style of film-making, and instinctively, you know something special will happen after these credits, and you're not disappointed by what follows. Blood, blood all over the car seat, and probably one of the most convincing painful screams ever. You really can feel for Tim Roth in that scene, it's like the real actor got one real bullet, and the rest is the touching expression of a growing friendship between Roth as Mr. Orange, and Mr. White, his mentor played by Harvey Keitel. He combs his hear, whispers something that provoke Orange's cute but heartbreaking smile: the chemistry is so believable, you understand that the movie is not just about cool dialogs. Then, comes Mr Pink as Steve Buscemi, asking who the rat is! Because this is the first serious element we have. It's the story of a botched jewel robbery, with a traitor among these gangsters. This question will be the starting point of the narrative with three specific back stories told in flashback.The three characters depicted in flashback are Mr. White, Mr. Orange, and Michael Madsen as Mr. Blonde. And in the memorable-action department, the winner is undoubtedly Mr. Blonde: the one who provided the most iconic and recognizable moment of the film. The iconic ear-cutting scene with the ""Stuck In the Middle With You"" music, like a reminiscence of ""A Clockwork Orange"" rape scene with 'Singin' in the Rain' as a musical background, the scene is disturbing, violent, bloody, but also  iconic. The violence is not meant to be cool, but just to show how psychotic Mr. Blonde, one of the most twisted gangster villains, is. And his torture is also crucial because it will unmask Mr. Orange as the snitch, and will make his relationship with White, even more complex. In one minute, the movie raises a new dimension, deeper and more tragic.Forget the cool and raunchy dialogs, the creative editing, where flashbacks interfere with parallel stories, as when we witness a great scene where Orange tells a story within another story. Too many insertions as to create a confusing feeling until the last iconic scene : after the slo-mo opening, the ear-cutting, the Mexican stand-off, as the last memorable scene that would lurch this movie into Pop Culture. Forget the wonderful ensemble cast with so many colorful characters (literally) and such believable actions and reactions like childishly arguing about nicknames instead of preparing a serious job. All these elements are great, but it would have been nothing without the tragedy  The beauty of the film relies on this profound relationship between Mr. Orange and Mr White, made of respect and honor, and the last minute of the film was something that reminded of Peckinpah's films, a moment of honesty and loyalty, incarnated by Orange's last confession, and White's heartbreaking gesture as to redeem the act of a man he still loved as friend  Keitel's last look before the movie ends will haunt me forever."
"After watching this half a dozen times with a biased, anti-Tarantino, ""what the heck is so great about this guy, anyway"" view(which, as most anyone watching any film with that view and a fair bit of self-knowledge will tell you, is a rather fruitless practice in pointlessness... if you've decided you're not going to like it, there's very little reason to think that you will, no matter how good it is; you need an open mind), I finally decided to give it a fair hearing... and I saw it for what it is. An unusual film, at least for its time. A stylish film full of cool dialog, cinematography, editing and music. The whole thing comes together perfectly and is very short of creating a sublime film experience. The plot is excellently written and told. The pace is perfect. I wasn't bored for a second, nor did I ever really want it to move faster or slower. The cinematography is magnificent, and incredibly well-integrated. Pans, dolly trips and, lest we forget, the stationary shots... all perfectly used. Very stylized. The acting is top-notch all-round. With most of the cast being name actors, this is no surprise, but they really do shine. Madsen, Buscemi, Keitel, Roth... all incredible. The one role that had less than good... well, let's be honest, it had rather awful acting. I'm speaking, of course, of Tarantino's character. Now, don't get me wrong; in From Dusk Till Dawn, this man did great. But just about any other time I've seen him act, he just doesn't seem to have the first clue. Being a film-maker myself(albeit on somewhat of a smaller scale than Quentin), I can relate to wanting to cast yourself in a role... but sometimes, you just need to face up to the facts, and admit it if you can't act. Still, that is a minor complaint. Another one might be that there are at least two fairly big characters that seem completely and entirely expendable... they had no real role in the action and could very, very easily have been cut with no real loss to the overall product. I won't name them here, but anyone who's seen the film will know who I'm talking about. All the characters, however, are well-written and their actions credible. Tarantino knows his stuff when it comes to writing... something that also shows in the dialog, which, although somewhat drawn-out at times, is exceptional. Well-delivered, too. When it comes to direction, he shows how talented he is, as well. The film is very well put together. The editing is great, with the non-linear time-line telling the story far better than a ""regular"" film ever could. One of the many Tarantino-fans, in fact, the very person who originally talked me into watching this film, once told me that he had heard of someone editing films with such time-lines - this, Pulp Fiction, Memento, etc. - so that their time-lines were perfectly linear. I'm sorry, I entirely respect their right to do such a thing... and I won't claim that their doing so has less artistic value than the original films in any way... but I refuse to watch that. A big part of this being so well-told lies in the time-line. Also, I'm a firm believer of watching something the way the makers intended it. Don't edit, don't censor, don't make your own version and pass it off as anything but just that... your own version, and not the original. Sorry, rant over. Finally, I just need to comment on the music... the soundtrack of this is just great. Tarantino collected so many amazing 70's tunes for this film and used them great. All in all, just a really, really good film. Very little keeps this from being a perfect ten, most of which I've covered here. I recommend this to anyone who can stomach the violence and who likes their films with a side of style. 8/10"
"Crime boss Joe Cabot brings together a group of criminals to perform a big one-off job.  To protect each other, they all use colour coded names. However on the day of the job, the police ambush the gang and each makes their own getaway.  As the gang comes together at their warehouse meeting point they realise that someone within the gang must have tipped the police or be an undercover.  The accusations and suspicions escalate into violence in the confines of the warehouse.When this film came out in the UK it caused an absolute firestorm of controversy over it's violence, even to the point that it was banned in the UK for a while.  I still find this absurd and am very glad we have moved to a more tolerant society where generally the BBFC protect vulnerable groups but let adults decide for themselves.  Looking at the media's adoring welcome for the ultra violent Kill Bill one can't help but marvel at how things have changed.  Looking at Reservoir Dogs now (or even then!) it simply isn't THAT violent.  However what it is is very sudden and all the more powerful for it.Tarantino directs the film and writes the film in such a way that it was impossible to ignore him even if the film was only a cult hit.  The dialogue is both witty at points but, more importantly, very tough and loaded with testosterone.  It is the writing that makes us like these coffee shop jokers at the start before shocking us by suddenly throwing us into a backseat bloodbath.  The entire job happens off camera, and only occasionally do we actually see the immediate effect of violence - usually we get the aftermath.  It is incredibly tight and very tense throughout, I was about 16 when my father took me to see this film - it has stayed with me since and I still considered it to be one of the best `job gone wrong' films of my generation.  It may not be original (there's a thin line between a homage and a rip off) but it is certainly effectively done.The cast are excellent and turn the hardboiled dialogue into convincing scenes.  Keitel is wonderful.  His character is a father figure of sorts and he is wildly out of control at times and balanced at others.  Likewise Buscemi is wide-eyed and freaking out for much of the film, but he does it well.  Roth is more balanced but is still good for it; it is his job to carry the emotional weight of the film and he does it well, despite a wandering American accent at times.  Madsen is great, maybe not the best character but wildly out of control.  Tierney was a great piece of casting, as was Bunker.  Penn is good but not the best of the cast.Tarantino mercifully has little acting to do, but it is his film as writer and director.  The flashbacks during the film was a brave way to do it but it really works well - mixing stories with flashbacks and so on.  No matter what the time of the scene, it all keeps moving tensely towards the climax. It may be a homage and not as original as some films but so what - it is tight and tense, macho, violent, funny and very enjoyable."
"I watched this movie for the first time without knowing what the movie was about. I remember hearing about how cool this movie was and I saw people wearing shirts and listening to the soundtrack, but I had never seen it. So when it first came out on DVD, I bought it without ever watching it before. In Tarantino I trust. For good reason. This is a classic movie, a throwback. A movie about a jewel heist gone wrong and the consequences of working with strangers. This flick has a great cast, great script, and flawless direction. Taratino films are great because they stress the story more than anything else. In all of his movies, the script is strong enough to carry the movie. Now add good over the top acting and you have a hit. The realism of this movie is what grabs you. You really feel like you are in that abandoned warehouse. If felt privileged to have bought such a movie without watching it first. An instant classic. I love this movie!"
"Four of six ruthless criminals await for their boss at an abandoned warehouse. After finding the diamond heist that they had all teamed up to accomplish was a trap, they realize that one of them is a police informant.The movie is told through a series of flashbacks from each of the criminals. I have never seen this done so breathtakingly. ""Dogs"" is an absolute masterpiece. It may not be Tarantino's best but is definitely one of the greatest movies of all time. There is absolutely nothing between the satirical writing or the hard-to-watch murders that could possibly make the movie any more perfect. Overall, the movie is absolutely incredible and I do not wish to say anymore to give away any sense of the ending.I highly recommend this movie."
"It's hard to get your head around the fact that 'Reservoir Dogs' has been around for ten years. It's almost difficult to remember a time before Tarantino made such an enormous impact (good and bad) on movies, but I saw this movie first time round before the hype. All I knew was that, like another ""dog"" movie from the same era that I saw, 'Man Bites Dog', that it was supposed to be violent, funny and disturbing, and that it starred a long time favourite of mine Harvey Keitel, and Tim Roth, who I mainly knew from Greenaway's 'The Cook The Thief His Wife & Her Lover'. Okay, I hope it's good I thought as I waited in the cinema listening to some half remembered 70s A.M. pop and a strange conversation about Madonna's sex life (the cinema was playing the soundtrack album before the main feature, but what did we know). Then the movie itself, electrifying and fascinating from the word go. It's impossible to describe the impact of seeing this for the first time without knowing what to expect! Still one of my greatest movie memories. Ten years later I've seen it countless times so the surprise has obviously worn off, but it is still a brilliant movie because beneath the violence and wise-cracks of Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi - 'In The Soup'), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen - 'Thelma & Louise'), and Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn - 'At Close Range'), there is a lot of  depth, that being the very human relationship between Mr. White (Keitel) and Mr.Orange (Roth). To me that is one of the things that elevates this above the many lame and unoriginal ""Tarantinoesque"" movies we've had to endure since 'Pulp Fiction'. His imitators just simply don't have a clue!Simply brilliant cinema, and a modern classic. This is absolutely essential viewing!"
"...this is the whole damn meal. ""Reservoir Dogs"" is about a crime gone horridly awry, and it makes no apologies for its violence, slurs, and language.  It doesn't have to, because of its brilliant, gripping script and plot twists, acting that makes you think these people are real, and a flashy presentation of it all. Quentin Tarantino came on the scene not with a whimper but a bang with this story of a diamond heist which is foiled by an undercover cop--one of the criminals.   The story unfolds backwards, beginning with Quentin Tarantino waxing poetic on Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"", and manages to cover Tim Roth writhing around in Harvey Keitel's backseat with a bullet in his stomach, Michael Madsen with a straight razor and a bound & gagged cop, Chris Penn crying rape in his father Laurence Tierney's office, and other insane, violent, and/or hilarious plot lines leading to a dazzling end.  The soundtrack adds just the right amount of style and superiority, which you'll understand immediately when the Dogs walk in slo-mo to the tune of ""Little Green Bag"". This movie can only compare to ""Pulp Fiction"" with its brilliance, otherwise, it is completely and utterly a unique experience."
"Reservoir Dogs will always go down as one of the most violent yet brilliant pieces of work ever to be shown on the silver screen. Tarrentino's script is brilliant and what is even more amazing is that it is his first movie. The acting is top grade , all the actors seem to come up with the performance of lives. There were calls when the film was released for it to be banned by the lilly livered liberals and while this is bloody and the language is coarse, for it to be banned would have deprived us of a classic Hollywood movie that oozes class as well as blood! 10 out of 10"
"A gang of thieves carry out an armed robbery on a Diamond warehouse. The police are after them so quickly that they suspect they have a rat in their company. This film starts right after the robbery, with flashbacks to before the robbery, and to the planning of the crime.After reading this plot, you know this is not your average crime film. In fact, I thought this film was about the whole diamond heist and that there will be a twist ending on who's the rat. It's absolutely nothing like that.Although an original way to make this film, this film is mostly boring, with an exception on the prologue of the film which I found entertaining for some reason. This film is very violent and bloody with shooting here and there and yelling about this and that. That's about it with the film.There's nothing interesting with the ""boring"" characters and ""bad"" story. The actings were relatively decent and this film is nowhere near one of the best films ever, although many people said it was, which lead me to buy the film on DVD, which I found a complete waste of money. One good thing about this film is that it's unpredictable and has funny jokes, which in real life would be just the opposite.This film is decent but not a very good film. It has some originality and clever humor but all squished with a boring plot and uninteresting characters. This is just my opinion but I should say for those who want to see this film should rent it first before buying."
"((((SPOILERS))))) I can think of nothing kind or good or positive to say about this truly repulsive motion picture. It is, quite simply, cruel. Quentin Tarantino's badly written script focuses on the events leading up to and the aftermath of a botched jewelry store heist. The heist itself is largely inconsequential to the story, as Tarantino's intent was apparently to create a character study of the participants. Yet, he has failed to give any of his characters anything resembling human personalities beyond phony macho posturing. The cast does little to add depth to the characters beyond the routine tough guy gambit of shouting their obscenity-laden dialogue at the top of their lungs. As such, they never raise their one-note performances above the level of brain dead savagery. But good, bad or indifferent, the actors have little to work with in the first place. Tarantino's much deified dialogue is insultingly dull-witted -- banal pop references peppered generously with tiresome profanity. The kindest thing to be said for Tarantino's ability to direct action is that it, at least, distracts from the emptiness of his written words. But, it is the violence that pushes the film into the realm of the utterly contemptible. There have been films with more violence and with more explicit violence, but few revel in its violence to the extent of RESERVOIR DOGS. The film doesn't use violence to show cause and effect, or to make a social statement, or to reflect reality, or even for cheap shock effect. It is violence for the sake of violence. The violence in DOGS is purely sadistic; a sleazy, pornographic celebration of inhuman cruelty.
Here and in his other violence-obsessed films, Tarantino embraces the infliction of pain as not just an act of power, but of an almost orgasmic display of gratification. Add to this the fact that the victims of the violence are usually bound, helpless, terrified, tortured, randomly selected and undeserving of such cruelty and the violence clearly becomes symbolic of rape. Worse, such savagery encourages the audience to identify with the perpetrator, not the victim, and Tarantino (all too effectively, I'm afraid) tries to make the viewer complicit in his sadism.  Okay, if Tarantino wants to indulge in his little S&M fantasies, that is his business. What is disheartening is the way people -- filmgoers and professional critics alike -- have been seduced into not just tolerating Tarantino's sadism, but to applaud it as well? DOGS centerpiece is the totally unnecessary and illogical kidnapping of a young policeman who is subsequently beaten, tortured and mutilated, for no apparent reason other than because it amuses one of the psychotic characters -- and, one can presume, Tarantino himself. The director stages the torture sequence like a comic musical number, complete with rock background music and choreography; casually topping it all off with the young officer's murder being the punchline of a joke. ""That's entertainment!"" seems to be Tarantino's pathetically cruel message. This killing should inspire anger or, at the very least, pity for the innocent man. Instead, it elicited raves by film viewers who see the scene as stylish, or worse, cool. What does it say about our society that not only do we condone the glorification of senseless violence as entertainment, but applaud it as art? Why have we become so obsessed with the matter of ""style"" that we can't see that beneath Tarantino's superficial technique there is sadism? RESERVOIR DOGS represents some sort of low point in the history of cinema. That it helped propel Tarantino to be considered one of the most influential directors of our time represents some sort of low point for society."
"People sure love this movie.  I have a friend who says that it's good because of the ear-slicing scene; most directors would cut away from such violence entirely, but here, we get to see the aftermath of a maiming.  Well yeah, ""Reservoir Dogs"" does push the envelope - but towards what?  Should we really praise a movie just because it wallows in violence more willingly than its predecessors?My ex-girlfriend says this is a Greek tragedy.  If that were true, the violence would be entirely justified, because it would help elevate ""Reservior Dogs"" to the level of an enlightening commentary on human nature. Alas, none of the characters is particularly noble; they start off as low-lifes and have nowhere to fall.  So, that defense doesn't seem to work either.In short, people have long tried to convince me that this is really a masterpiece.  But even the best parts - such as the opening dialogue in the restaurant - seem artificial and engineered.  Tarantino is ripping off older, better films and directors wholesale.  There are shades of ""The Taking of Pelham 123"" here, and there's also a dash of ""The Omen"" at the end.  Hitchcock, Frankenheimer, and even John Carpenter did this kind of stuff before, and they did it better.  No doubt Tarantino was a breath of fresh air after the shallow era of 1980s action movies, but he was not much of an innovator, and I don't think that his super-cool style has stood even the shortest test of time; he has, after all, practically dropped off the face of the earth."
"I remember watching this movie when it first came out and I did not know what to think. I mean, it was different. I could not remember seeing dialog like this before or a scene where a guy cuts another guy's ear off. It was unique in that regard. Mind you, it was different, but not really special. Moreover, some parts were very boring. Other parts were so ""talky"" and somewhat over the top, that they strained credibility. However, there were some funny lines as well. After having watched this again, some ten years later, I can say with all honesty, this film has not aged well. On second look, you see what looks like a first year film student project. It still has funny lines, but the story is paper thin. The actors tend to over act and the dialog is so full of Clint Eastwood wannabe one-liners, that you just roll your eyes. Michael Madsen cannot act, sorry. He is cool, but he cannot act. Tim Roth's attempt at an American accent makes him sound like Ralph Cramden from the HoneyMooners. I was just amazed at how bad this film really looked to a more mature person. The funny lines just don't cover that constant posturing of characters that have no real depth. The movie is cotton candy, it looks filling, but is far from it. Perhaps there will always be 14 year old boys around to give this ""cool film"" high marks, but I fear it will grow more ridiculous the older I get. However, Tarantino has this cult of personality going and I am sure the 10s will continue coming in for this film and a 10 might mean perfect in here, but that don't make it so."
"To quote the great Terry Rossio:""There are many films with the goal 'to find your way home.' But there's only one film where a girl clicks together a pair of ruby slippers.""What that basically means is that the goal of many stories is essentially the same. The 'find your way home' example is used in films such as E.T., The Wizard of Oz, and Back To The Future, just to name a few. Only one of those has ruby slippers. Only one has a bicycle fly past the moon. Only one has a time-traveling Delorean.The goal of 'criminals getting together to pull off the perfect heist' has been used is such films as The Killing, The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, and City on Fire...just to name a few. Only one had an un-chronological order to the events. Until Reservoir Dogs. Only one had the criminals use color-coded names to keep their identities anonymous. Until Reservoir Dogs. Only one had an undercover cop infiltrate a gang of crooks and befriend another crook, only to get shot during the process of the robbery, until he confesses the truth to his new friend. Until Reservoir Dogs.If you cannot see that this entire film is just a cut and paste job, then you have to be mentally impaired. And that is not an insult.As far as originality goes, Tarantino hasn't got to that point yet. The point where he creates something on his own. This is just a second hand, second rate cut and paste job that is only mildly entertaining on first viewing. Upon seeing the film subsequent times, it only gets worse, and it's (very many) flaws only stand out to an even more obvious extent. This is a bad movie even for someone who has never directed anything before in his life.The film starts with a discussion that might as well be about Jesus, pancake syrup, or the duties of the school crossing guard. None of these have anything to do with the story...much like the conversation we see before the opening credits roll. Which brings me to another discussion that takes place later on in the film...something about Lady E and a superglue incident. How is this any of our business? How does it advance the story? What do we get out of it besides a possible forced laugh of pity? It's not our business, it does not advance the story, and we get nothing out of that scene at all. You can literally remove it and be left with the same exact film, just without that scene. From the point before that scene started to after it finished, NOTHING HAS CHANGED AT ALL. It's complete filler. A total waste of time.This movie would have been pretty good without extraneous scenes floating around, popping up at random, and taking entirely too long to finish. The best example of this is the whole Tim Roth segment. It interrupts the flow of the story and it simply not fun to watch. It's a huge dead moment right before the climax of the movie and it's very easy to simply lose interest at that point. When the finale does come, it's more of a ""good, it's over"" point rather than any kind of realization. Tarantino couldn't even create a good third act when he literally just copied the third act from City on Fire, and in some cases...shot for shot! Resertvoir Dogs showed us nothing that we have not seen before...literally. The only positive thing about it is the cast, and that's even not so great. Most of the dialogue is just screaming and f-words being used like it's going out of style (and it has, thanks to films like this), and the ""infamous"" and ""extreme"" violence is about on par with The Lion King. So if you're thinking about watching this movie...just watch a good heist movie instead. I suggest:The Killing The Asphalt Jungle The Taking of Pelham One Two Three"
"When critics say that some films are pornographic because of the way they depict violence, they are referring to the type of violence that appears in ""Reservoir Dogs."" The film maker's artistic judgment seems to be clouded by a bloodthirsty hatred of police officers. I am thinking particularly of a scene in which a captive police officer is mutilated by his criminal captors. The feeling conveyed to me was one of sadistic joy in the victim's suffering, a sense that he deserved to be mutilated simply because he was a cop. I am sure that some misguided admirers of this film applauded the scene precisely for that reason. Unfortunately, a lot of people hate the police, and for them such a film functions as escapist ""entertainment,"" but ""Reservoir Dogs"" seems to lack any redeeming value of another kind, like a snuff movie. The only other time I've seen such poor artistic and ethical judgment in a film was in ""Caligula,"" by the producer Bob Guccione, where in one scene a Roman aristocrat forces a soldier to drink a gallon of wine and then cuts his belly open for the fun of seeing the liquid spill out of it. Some gullible members of the audience actually cheered when they saw that. Like Guccione, Tarantino, director of ""Reservoir Dogs"" may be a big fan of pornography and possibly he doesn't make the distinction between sex and violence. Certainly everything of his I've seen looks like a porno film stylistically, but he focuses mainly on bloodshed and torture instead of lust and love. Unless you're in the mood for a tasteless exercise in violence, you would do much better to rent John Huston's ""Asphalt Jungle,"" one of the best and most intelligently made caper gone wrong movies ever made."
"I watched Ringo Lam's city on fire and I was upset to see how Quentin stole everything from it to make Reservoir Dogs, Yes I like the way he combines different movies to make one but reservoir dogs was like an American Version of city on fire with white actors (not in a bad way).I know it has been said before, but I recommend you to watch City on fire, things that didn't make sens or if you don't want to waste your time listening to those tough guys talking about what they did, City on fire will just show you what happened in a small box of time.But anyway, I think Mr Blond and Pink made it look pretty though.I am sorry, just in case he paid for the rights."
"RESERVOIR DOGS exploded onto cinema screens in 1992 and I can still remember the shock waves it caused due to the excessive violence . If memory serves me right Glasgow Council came very close to banning it from cinema chains in the city and they weren't alone in trying to do this either as newspaper headlines and word of mouth screamed how violent the movie was as Quentin Tarantino became the most infamous and influential movie director of the mid 1990s . RESERVOIR DOGS was finally allowed a British network TV transmission in the Summer of 1997 on channel 4 . I was rubbing my hands in anticipation at seeing this movie . After seeing the movie I felt disgusted . Not because it was a movie whose violent content had sickened me but because I'd fallen for the hype like a total shmuck . This must be the most overrated movie of the 1990s!!!!! SLIGHT SPOILERS !!!!! First of all the characters meet in a diner . If you're carrying out a heist is it a good idea to gather in a public place where potential witnesses can identify you ? And would a bunch of robbers be interested in discussing the lyrics of Madonna or the films of John Holmes ? It might be cool and trendy to discuss pop culture but in the context of this movie it's illogical . Soon the narrative switches to a warehouse where the robbers have arrived after their disastrous heist and we're treated to some very obvious exposition : "" F***in' sick f*** . Why'd he do that ? Did you see what he did to that girl ? How old was she ? Nineteen ? F***in' sick motherf***er "" After the movie finished this is what bothered me - I had expected the movie to end by showing us the massacre at the bank BUT THIS NEVER HAPPENS ! and I can't describe how cheated I felt . Okay we're shown the various robbers making their getaways but not once are we shown the much referred to robbery itself which made me feel very disappointed , not because I wanted to see teenage girls get murdered but because it instinctively felt like it should have been the centrepiece scene / climax scene of the movieAs for the rest of the movie's reputation for violence it's ill deserved . There's buckets of blood but many , many movies also feature buckets of blood and gore and don't receive half as much attention as RESERVOIR DOGS . Remember the much criticised scene of the cop getting his ear cut off ? Didn't anyone notice that this actually happens off camera ? Ironically enough the only murder that did disturb me - "" What this cop ? "" BANG - is chilling because it's committed so coldly not because it's graphic in any way . Is there anything I like about RESERVOIR DOGS ? Harvey Keitel is the type of actor I'd watch even if it involved him reading out his shopping list , and the scene where it's revealed who the undercover cop is memorable along with the compelling "" How's he going to explain that to the bad guys when they return ? "" storyline . But at the end of the day I can't help thinking RESERVOIR DOGS is ruined by its much hyped reputation . WHITE HEAT is a very similar movie and a much better one RESERVOIR DOGS gets six bones out of a possible ten"
"This movie just bored me no end. It was so painful to watch. The direction by Quentin Tarintino was terrible and the actors were very miscasted. I watched this with my friend and he also thought it was terrible. Nothing to admire, no action, just cussing. There's no point going to the message boards saying that you don't like it, because if you do people at the message board will use anything as an excuse for you to love it. ""If you don't like it you don't get or you're an idiot. It was Quentin Tarintino's first film, go easy on him."" Don't let tall this get in the way of your opinion, because this movie was stupid and pointless. Very predictable too. So I wont even say anymore.I recommend it to anyone who loves Quentin Tarintino. By the way, I find Quentin Tarintino overrated, everything he does people think it's great, but it's not."
"I can only imagine that those who like this film find appeal in the violence.  It certainly isn't in the direction or story-telling.  It's an incredibly badly-written and episodic piece, full of irrelevant scenes without which it would only be an hour long.  What is relevant makes no use of the medium.  Characters are not introduced through telling actions, but by introducing themselves in some kind of criminal job-interview. Tarantino's 'genius' seems to be a habit of having the lowest sort of people engaged in violent pursuits converse as casually as ladies at tea.  It's a trick he uses and re-uses in all his films.  Maybe Reservoir Dogs was meant to have deconstructionist elements a la From Dusk Till Dawn, but I think it's just what it appears to be:  a really bad film.William Bell"
"I first saw this film when I was 15. I thought it was brilliant, really original and generally great. However, now (3 Years later) I realise it is nothing more than a pretentious piece of garbage.Sure, it looks good, but when you really get down to it it's not doing anything. It doesn't have any real substance, it's not commenting on anything, it's just a totally throwaway product. Tarantino is talking loudly and saying nothing. And THAT narrative structure - it looks and feels original, but independent and foreign movies have been doing it, better, for years and years.A truly trashy piece of postmodernism at it's worst."
"Quentin Tarantino seems to concentrate his movies very much along the lines of ""cool"" and ""tough"" and pulpy storylines and characters. To me, his scripts come across as done by someone who reads too many B-grade comic books, mainly because his movies have very similar content.The story is very thin, and to sum up the what you see on the screen most of the time: there's a bunch of cookie-cutter emotionally retarded tough-guys who compete over who can deliver the coolest and toughest lines to each other and wave their shiny guns at each other with the right sort of swagger. That sort of thing is just so ho-hum, clichéd, and juvenile that I felt like tuning out right away.Mixed into this macho posturing is some gratuitious violence (even to the point of being repulsive at times, for example when Mr. Blonde gets his way with the cop) and a couple of ""cool"" stories in the vein of Pulp Fiction's story about McDonald's in France (what depth). Too bad it's pretty much gloss over content. The only flash of intelligence in this movie is right at the beginning where Mr. Pink delivers his speech on tipping. That's what kept me somewhat interested at first. Unfortunately, it was all downhill from there.This sort of movie doesn't appeal to me at all, although I'm sure it has some appeal to teenagers who consider the like of _The Fast and the Furious_ to be ""cool"". Me, I guess I'm just too old (27) to be impressed by this sort of trashy stuff. Had I seen it ten years ago, my review then might have been somewhat different."
"What to say.. a cliche story, badly told, with non believable characters 1/4"" deep.  I rented this movie because a friend told me it was the best movie ever, unfortunately it was pretty much the opposite, especially the whole setup. I saw Saturday morning cartoons that were more interesting."
"Unlike most of Tarantino's films this one I would not give a negative rating to. It shares all of the things that I hate about his other films (bouncing around in time & sequence, unnecessary blood & violence, no plot and no resolution) with the rest of his films, but for some reason this one does not make me want to sort my socks instead. I would still say that you should not waste your time watching this movie unless you really just want to waste time. The only redeeming quality of this film is that you can watch this one film and and you will have just seen every Quentin Tarantino movie ever made, because they are all the same. Just be sure that you can handle the violence and the blood because that is about all you are going to get from this film."
"Everybody knows that criminals are big losers but still there is a strong tradition in American cinema especially in Hollywood of making films which glorify criminals.Everybody knows that Godfather,a film about a mafia family is hailed as a classic film.People know well as to what kind of things mafia do and how harmful they are to human society in general.Reservoir Dogs is one such dumb film which through its antics champions the cause of crooks without morals.Tarantino is believed to be a humorist however his humor is undoubtedly bland and mainly consists of filthy abuses.A word about the violence in the film: by showing macabre scenes of senseless violence Tarantino has shown that in the name of creative freedom and in order to gain easy publicity all rules can be broken and more the violence the more controversial the film is going to be.Good that this film has not been emulated by other film makers. It is a good development that till now no studio has come forward with the idea of making a sequel of this film.God save America who has Quentino."
"Vintage Tarantino. Totally boorish, tasteless, boring, repetitious, tedious & moronic. Everything his loving audiences deserve."
"First, I love Tarantino, because he is able (as a director) to follow his own unique style and made a very good movie like Pulp Fiction. But when making Reservoir Dogs, he was (in my opinion) maybe just searching for the borders of what other directors did not dare to do. A movie as RD with (just) a strong focus on violence is not enough for me to give it a high rating. Of course the acting and directing was very good, but I was missing a real strong script. And thats why I could not enjoy this movie and was just very disappointed because my expectations were very high (also based on the high rating on IMDB). So, when you not only like violence, but also care about a good script (story) than you also want to watch the Mob-movies of Martin Scorsese like Good fellas and Casino."
"People were forcing me to get this movie, so I eventually got it. I watched it waiting for the action and waiting for them to show us the robbery. How can this be called a gangster movie if they don't even show you a robbery? It said everywhere that this movie is a classic. What's classic about it? Robbers who cuss and act childish all the time waffling on about a robbery? All they do is talk and swear for 94 minutes, that's all they do. And it was very predictable who the cop was. There was no surprise. The reason I knew it was Mr. Orange was because Mr. White was treating him like a little 5 year old and he still treated the others like they were a piece of garbage. The direction was poor. The pacing was off. The humor with them discussing body functions and people's religion, etc was way off. They tried too hard to be funny when it came to he humor. There are 2 great songs in this movie, but that's it. The only thing that's original about this movie is the color names. The movie just seemed pointless, especially after the ending. They all shoot each other. What was the point in that? Them waffling on about a robbery, then nd up killing each other? What sense is that? I guess people love Quentin Tarintino so much that they'll accept anything he gives you. The dialog wasn't even good. Gangsters talking about their life and trying to be humorous, BORING! A lot of people will probably abuse me for this review, but i'm sorry, this is what the film is about and you fall for such poor movies like this. The reason I type this is to also warn others to let them know that you'll be expecting nothing more from this film than gangsters (Who they don't even act like) waffling on about a failed robbery that they don't even show you. 1/10"
"Many people believe ""Reservoir Dogs"" is a good film. It is not. Tarantino failed to make it into anything but violence and the combination of music and camera-work. The screenplay was poor, but the lines, or at least the way they were written, were convincing. This film has absolutely no redeeming qualities, and I use the word ""redeeming"" loosely about movies. Without a doubt, many movies are about nothing and are good. ""Dogs"" is about a group of men who messed up a bank robbery and went to a warehouse to talk about things and get very angry at each other.Many find the movie hip, but at best the movie itself is not hip, the pitiful characters may seem to be, but really the only hip character is Mr. White, played by Harvey Keitel. Anyone that thinks supposed professionals who can't do their jobs right, swear a great deal over nothing, get very tense, and lose their cool on a dime work well for a movie centered around nothing in particular are wrong. A very weak film."
"What is wrong with Quentin Tarantino? The guy thinks of nothing but vile, despicable violence. His worst piece of trash is Natural Born Killers, but piece of crap..Reservoir Dogs is really disgusting. But what is more disturbing than the film is how so many people revere it. What have we come to? This film made me gag and want to throw up. What possible message comes from a film such as this? All I can say is God help us!"
"It also has no entertainment value - it was a chore to watch.It's all about stupid people killing each other. The senseless violence is extremely offensive and although I could see the language being typical of the type of person, I found that offensive too.I could have spent my time better lying on my bed watching the ceiling for 99 minutes."
Easily one of the worst films I have ever seen. I don't know how some people love it. Seriously overrated. Basically set in the one scene. One scene of gory violence which is hard to watch. A few pathetic attempts at humor. People who say its one of the best films of all time probably haven't watched much films. I don't think it's a proper gangster film like good fellas or Casino Which are classics. I also don't like how some characters try to come across as tough. Complete Waste Of Time ... Watch a real film like casino Twasnt worth the money I paid to watch it . I have to stretch this out to fill in ten lines of text
"I don't know what kind of drugs you have to take to make this movie seem good, but it's one of the most overwrought, pretentious pieces of crap I've ever seen. All the characters sound like a bunch of Gen-X hipsters sitting around on a second-hand couch smoking bongs. If I wanted to hear a bunch of doofuses deconstructing Madonna lyrics, I'd hang out at the local coffee shop. Or I'd stick my head in the oven. Or something. But if I want to see a good crime movie I'll stick with The Maltese Falcon, The Grifters, Miller's Crossing; hell, even 101 Dalmatians is a better ""film noir"" than this overrated stinker."
"I have to think that this movie is one of the reasons that so many young filmmakers today think you can build a movie around random violence and cursing to no particular end.  I can't believe I sat through it.  Check out ""Cry Danger"" for a sanity check..."
"It is extremely difficult to make a good movie when almost the entire script happens in the same room within a few hours.  In fact, at the moment, I can't think of any movie that has accomplished that.  Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs"" certainly hasn't.""Reservoir Dogs"" could have been an excellent theatre play.  In fact, it IS an excellent theatre play that was taped and sold to us as a movie.  It is sad that we are so preoccupied with movies that a script like this has to be wasted on one.Making matters worse is the violence.  Tarantino often uses it in his movies to get attention, and this time takes it too far.  ""Pulp Fiction's"" violence was milder and stood out less from the rest of the story, but ""Reservoir Dogs"" goes way over the top.  It is very difficult to offend me with violence yet Tarantino does just that."
"First off... it is clear that this movie is a rip-off. I couldn't believe when i first saw this movie what i was watching. It is a complete word for word Verbatim of Lung F fong wan ( city on fire ) , hong kong action movie starring Chow Yun Fat.. i don't know how he got away with remaking this movie which came out in 1987 by the way, and all the fame he has accumulated since , How Tarantino got any credit for this movie is unbelievable. watch City on Fire first before you start discrediting me please, they are all in it Mr. Blonde,pink,brown,white etc etc ... SHOCKED is what i was when i saw it and look at him now"
"The only reason I give this 3 stars instead of 1 is because of the funny moments in the film. Now what in the hell do people like so much about this? It was just a literal bloody mess, none of the main characters make it, a cop is saved just to be brutally murdered later, and the only people who seem to be friends and you sympathize with, one of them kills the other in the end, just before the cops could've come and save them both! Just a brutal, bloody, cruel, sadistic picture, it's beyond me what kind of people enjoy this. I've seen a few Tarantino movies and they were similar, didn't like them, now I'm convinced, I'm never watching a Tarantino movie again, I wish I hadn't wasted my time on this."
"""Reservoir Dogs"" ends with Harry Nilsson's ""Coconut"" playing over the credits, a quirky song in which a woman ""puts the lime in the coconut and drinks 'em both up"" before getting a bellyache and calling a doctor who tells her to ""put the lime in the coconut and drink 'em both up"" which causes her to get a bellyache and call a doctor who tells her to ""put the lime in the coconut and drink 'em both up"".In other words, the ""cause"" is the ""cure"" is the ""cause"" is the ""cure"" is the ""cause"". But is the woman stupid for listening to the doctor or is the doctor wise in accelerating the problem until her sickness goes away (possibly because the idiot's bellyache eventually leads to death?).Regardless, Quinten Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs"" finds a gang of foul mouthed low-lives trapped in a similar, inane loop. After a botched jewelry heist, a group of criminals gather in an abandoned warehouse where they try to ascertain who amongst them is an undercover cop. In other words, there's a poisonous lime in a group of coconut nut cases, and they're all busy trying to smoke him out.As arguments ensue, one of the gang members, whilst waiting on a doctor, begins to die slowly due to a bullet (ie belly ache) in the gut. Meanwhile, tensions escalate to such an extent that the men shoot one another to death. The wounded man with the bullet hole belly ache is then revealed to be the poisonous rat. Had the others let him die, they'd have been fine.So it's the ""lime in the coconut"" scenario; uncovering the cause of the stomach ache equals finding the rat, finding the rat leads to stomach aches, stomach aches are cured by finding the rat, finding the rat leads to stomach aches...etc etc, until the patients all die. Cue the coconut song.Tarantino typically makes modern versions of 1970s exploitation films. But while ""Reservoir Dogs"" has the seediness, cool posing, macho vulgarity and blood quota of 1970s exploitation cinema, its actual framework owes more to 1950s noir. In this regard it unfolds like a stage-play, is dialogue driven, possesses a bare aesthetic, sparse, stripped down sets, and ends with a fatalistic noir climax in which everyone dies.And while the film pulls from 70s blaxploitation, Hong Kong cool, Lam's ""City on Fire"", Kubrick's ""The Killing"", the original ""Oceans 11"" (all those slow motion men in suit shots), and Peckinpah's blood operas, Tarantino's overall tone is much more playful. He's more akin to David Mamet, using freestyle dialogue to toy with conventions. What matters is not the content of the film, or even the characters, but the farcical playfulness of it all; the way it moves, skirts around expectations and then joyously self destructs. Today, with most artists now with an encyclopedic knowledge of cinema, such that they can, like Tarantino, spin entire tales out of bits and pieces in a matter of days, the challenge is to slow down and let go of the mix-tape. This kind of ""I can do this, but should I?"" questioning is itself the core dilemma of Tarantino's ""Inglorious Basterds"".""Reservoir Dog's"" bloodiness was deemed sensational back in the 90s, but that's largely because Hollywood's previous 15 years were dominated by a kind of sanitized, blockbuster violence (""Indiana Jones"", ""Star Wars"" etc). Many complain that the film relies too heavily on designer brutality, cool, gratuitous violence, and that its characters are simply pop culture chewing posers, but while that is true, the film is also unique in Tarantino's filmography (""Basterds"" excluded) in that it actually plays like a warped morality tale. Shakespeare with guns, the film rejects any sanctimonious message, ""crime doesn't pay"" or otherwise, and instead lets us eavesdrop on a bunch of psychopaths who, quite hypocritically, view themselves as professionals with ordinary jobs. Throughout the film our criminals thus view with scorn a psycho played by Michael Madsen. They're not like him, you see. They have ethics, codes, rules and professional courtesy. But when push comes to shove they nevertheless all degenerate into reservoir dogs, cruel, psychopathic and little more than petty hoodlums.Like most of Tarantino's films, ""Reservoir Dogs"" is a film about film. Here the characters are all artifacts chewing on pop culture artifacts, except Tim Roth, who plays an undercover cop. While Keitel does a phony tough guy routine and Michael Madesen does a cheap Clint Eastwood, Tim Roth's the chameleon actor who infiltrates their school play and brings their curtain down. He even starts by killing their director.7.9/10 – Worth two viewings. See Mamet's films, some of which do this stuff better."
The diner scene is the best part of this movie. The next 80 minutes is just a bunch of insecure nutjobs yelling at each other. Totally unbelievable characters. You can guess who the undercover officer is after about ten minutes. Incredibly boring and over-rated garbage.
"Despite not being a high budget Tarantino film, it is my favorite one. I saw Pulp Fiction indeed, but there are some things:
1) The cinematography in Reservoir Dogs (for me) is slightly better, as it captures every moment perfectly.
2) Characters are more understandable.
3) Movie focuses on same characters who are connected to the same story which makes it easier to follow.I believe all of the actors did a pretty good job. Movie is violent no doubt so be careful if you're new to Tarantino. If you already know him and like his movies you've probably seen this but if you haven't, go see it. Also note that the gunplay is remarkably good.10/10 (Orginally a 9/10 but I had to give an extra point for the rewatchability factor)"
"I didn't enjoy this movie one bit. I found this movie to be very boring and absolutely preposterous at times. The only reason I even gave it a 3/10 is because it was so bad it actually made me laugh at times. The story line lacks depth and promotes violence. The hatred that is exhibited for police officers is somewhat repulsive. It was actually painful to watch. The actors did a good job at portraying characters but most of the scenes are so unnecessary and irrelevant that I lost interest in them. This movie is an absolute NO from me! Do not waste the hour and 39 minutes of your lives. I am actually in awe at the amount of people in the reviews describing this movie as a ""classic""."
"Maybe its because I watched Pulp Fiction a good six months before I saw this, but Reservoir Dogs seems lacking in its potential.
The plot is extremely intriguing, what you would expect from Tarantino. Multi-layered, with interesting characters and some classic lines (I can't help it, but it all appears...inferior to PF). Superb acting from Steve Buscemi and Harvey Keitel, though Tim Roth clinches it. It's also nice to see the many references to Fiction (or vice-versa? Which one came out first again?) and of course Tarantino himself.Still, was it me or did RD seem far too short? Most of the film was taken up by Buscemi's paranoia and the other character's monologues, which is where I felt it stumbled. The conversations in Fiction flow well although they are surreal, but in RD it was clunky and awkward. Plus the set got boring after a while, it was an abandoned warehouse after all. There are still some things I don't get about RD. What was the message? There didn't seem to be any (apart from, don't be an undercover cop) whilst Pulp Fiction was clearly about redemption. The significance of *spoiler* Mr Pink the only one who survives? What, cowardice pays off? And although the whole torture scene didn't fit, I'll accept it because really it's nothing compared to the randomness of ""the gimp"" incident in PF. What gets me is that people are STILL yakking on about how gruesome it was (Mr Blondes torture scene, that is). It's just a prosthetic ear and some blood.
Ah well. Could have been more, but good nonetheless. Seven out of ten."
"This movie is beyond terrible. I must say, I found it quite disappointing. I watched it with a (kinda) friend of mine, whom said that this was by far his favorite movie. Of course, I was interested, and asked why, and he responded that I just HAVE TO watch it. Well I must say, the story line was absolutely atrochious. The conversations were indeed hilarious, but yet very random. The openining scene talks about the various women that the men have been with, and what they have done. The first 5 minutes, I thought this would be a great movie. But then from then on, I just got bored. Too much repeated conversation. Then one of the heist members tortures a cop, which I found quite disturbing, watching the cops ear get hacked off, and then almost having a flame lit on him whilst there was gasoline doused all over him. Yes, I must say, this movie was boring... no significant characters, and just way too random. And, as I said before, I must say, this movie was by far below par, and competes for my worst movie ever, compariing with ""Spirit"" (G movie) From Walt Disney. Don't spend $5 to rent this, or $15 to buy it. This sucks."
"The idea that Quentin Tarantino could be seen as a great filmmaker for ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" is ridiculous, and ""Reservoir Dogs"" is proof exhibit A. ""Reservoir Dogs"" is simply one of the most shamelessly plot-driven movies I have ever seen. First of all, what is the point of the commode story? In the movie, the crooks are supposed to keep their mouths shut, but Tarantino has Mr. Orange go on and on, pointlessly, about the commode story just so Tarantino can make an attempt at art filmmaking by showing Mr. Orange talking to the actual police officers in the bathroom and dry his hands in slow motion. Talking that much would only make it more obvious that Mr. Orange is a policeman, anyway. Also, as one viewer pointed out, Mr. Orange doesn't shoot Mr. Blonde before Mr. Blonde cuts off the police officer's ear. Want to know why? Because Tarantino needed Mr. Orange to hear the bad guys say they were going to return to the warehouse after ditching the cars, but he also needed the ear-cutting scene. What else was there to do except make Mr. Orange not give a damn about the police officer, which is totally ridiculous. Also, why in God's name was Mr. Blonde going to set fire to the police officer? Wouldn't that have drawn attention to the warehouse hideout? Sure, it would. But Tarantino threw out that logic just so he could make a ""thrilling"" scene as Mr. Blonde prepares to set fire to the police officer. Also, what sense does it make to have the warehouse in the middle of a neighborhood? What a bunch of smart crooks. It's no wonder they couldn't snoop out the undercover cop. This movie shouldn't even have made as little as it did (one million, I believe). And it figures that after about three years Tarantino's name dropped out of sight."
"This repulsive, reprehensible trash for Quentin Tarantino has to rank as one of the worst movies ever made.  When I wasn't bored to tears by interminable dialogue, I was repulsed by the glorification of sadism as an alternative life-style.  The Marquis De Sade would have been proud.  Tarantino should put his talents to suitable use and just make a real 'snuff' film.  See 'Clockwork Orange' instead.  That is a work of real genius."
"A great creative insight is to take things that we think of as separate and contained (like 'art', 'genius', or 'ideas') and realize how they are fluid and inter-dependent, conditioned by factors. This is not to expose anything as little, deconstruction for its sake; it's to show them to be doable, that a road leads up to them. (It's also one of the three main areas of Buddhist practice)One obvious way to do this would be to take this and note the many influences. This has been done to death already, every bit that Tarantino hoped to keep packed or wanted us to find out has been laid out in the open. But this just gives us someone, genius or not, who stole from the right places.Another way would be to see that it doesn't work the same way as it did when new because it has all been made ordinary by slavish followers, gobbled up by familiarity. The moments of simple banter away from plot, the fooling round with edges of story without showing the main center-piece, bleeding on a floor, following Mr. Blonde outside to pick up a can of gasoline; Tarantino was probably proud that he was being ""real"", making a radical break from Bruckheimer's Hollywood. It's bits and pieces of Godard, Cassavetes, Altman, and others. To see it now shows how theatric it is, not ""real"" at all. (The least theatric acting is by the bound cop. Roth is just woeful.) It's The Killers, with the violence and gum pop visuals as typical to see as The Killers was typical without them in its own time.Me, I'd like to settle for something else that brings us to real influence of a more elusive kind.Everything you see here is coming from a young guy who was at the best possible time in his life, lifted from obscurity and everything was beginning to click into place beyond expectation. Can you imagine how giddy he must have been to hear yes from Keitel and here's a check?It's Tarantino coming in from the outside as someone young and eager to make a dream come true; it's bursting with energy but disciplined, kept in check by not having everything at your disposal, being the new kid on set. It would be nothing without this energy.And it's Tarantino being rooted in his own world as he brings the dream alive, suburban LA. None of the story has any outlet into real lives, it's all bounced around movie cutouts. Gangsters showing up before a heist for breakfast in tuxedos? But it's the video clerk's imagination cruising through his own world. He has guys exchange banter about a stripper from Palos Verdes, Roth improvise a story about buying weed the summer of '86. So this is the most vibrant sense I get; someone making it, not having to prove himself because he's there, making a movie with name actors around town, relaxed and fired up at the same time. See if you can feel this off his screen presence (and what a stark difference from his surly presence now).His next one would be the apogee of this path. It can also be traced to the 30 year old who had flown himself to Amsterdam to write away from home like a Hemingway, living the dream."
"""Reservoir Dogs"" has great casting, an amazing script, awesome characters and a classic sound track. Perhaps Mr. Pink should move to Australia, a society that tips only when someone deserves it and not because they are doing their job. It is very rare that I give a movie a 10 out of 10, but this movie is just gold."
"This movie is just nonsense. It goes nowhere, it's incredibly boring and the best thing that can happen to you is that you pray it's over. I just don't get why this is on the IMDb top! Seriously, if you like movies as much as I do, you shouldn't waste your time with this. Not even the 'best' parts are worth it.If you don't trust me yet, watch the first five minutes of the movie and when you start asking yourself ""When is this going to start?"" maybe you'll get it. That's how the entire movie is. Completely BORING.Some people say that one good thing about it is that it focuses on the story behind everything. Don't believe that! You'll find that there are 10-20 minutes scenes that are completely unnecessary (oh sorry... just like the entire film...).I've seen lots of movies, and maybe I didn't like the 10% of them, because I usually try to see what's behind it, and if there's something, I appreciate it, but this is definitely the worse thing I've come upon."
"Is there money in crime, sure, Hollywood(why not holy wood?), show! us the way and nontheleast Q.Tarantino in this dispiccable nonstory that is best left unmentioned, and not ironized like Oliver Stone tried with Natural Born Killers."
"If you are a human being with any ounce of intelligence, I plead for you to read this and heed my warning. This movie was truly pathetic in all respects. I have absolutely lost all respect for Quentin Tarantino. His obsession with blood only allows the film to disrespect my eyes more. The plot is so full of holes that it is just ridiculous. I am so disappointed that I don't believe I will ever watch a movie by this director again. Watching this after 'Inglourious Basterds' made dissatisfaction even more unbearable. My advice: watch the first 45 minutes of this film and simply shut off the television. Ponder for several minutes as to the end result, but do not, under any circumstances, finish this calamity. I would not want to hear any more reports of self-mutilation or people gouging out their own eyeballs. Furthermore, for those of my unfortunate brethren who have had the hardship of viewing this catastrophe, answer me this: Who shoots Eddie? I advise all of those who agree with this rating to rate this movie as well, for there is simply no way that we can allow such a fallacious good rating to exist."
"I'll give the director this much: few films have ever gotten me thinking so much about why I dislike them.  Actually, I would have just walked out on the thing and be done with it, but the movie's undeserved reputation caused me to wonder if I'd missed something in my rush to judgement (and, not coincidentally, to the exit).  I suspect I didn't miss much.  There's a lot to dislike about ""Reservoir Dogs"".  The film's violence is legendary, as is its potty-mouthed dialog, but neither of those are necessarily bad things in a movie. 
No, what's unforgivable in this movie is the way the director revels in his ability to offend the viewer.  The stage is set in the diner scene, as the cast takes turns mouthing cleverly-scripted yet coldly unfunny trash talk, and by all accounts reaches its climax in the bloody scene that finally got me to walk out of the theater, 20 minutes after I first felt the urge. 
But never mind the blood and guts--though one suspects that if Tarantino had directed ""Fargo,"" it would consist of little more than shots of the woodchipper in use.  The diner scene pretty much spells out that the director's not interested in making the viewer laugh or think, but only to make him recoil.  Tarantino is undoubtedly skilled at this, but it's not the sort of reaction I'm willing to pay to experience, as one gets enough of that for free these days."
"I had heard ""this movie is awesome, the best made!"" so i watched it, and it was THE WORST movie i have ever seen! If you want a similar movie, go to blockbuster and rent Boondock Saints! STAY AWAY FROM THIS FILM!"
"Spoilers herein.Yet another film about acting, this time the undercover cop. But `Donnie Brasco' was sharper.The tone is of a play, with artificially snappy dialog.  But almost anything from Mamet does this better. The camera moves about to keep the central set from being dull. But dePalma is first among many are who is being copied here.There's some cruelty, but it is fakey compared to, say Greenaway; and less cogent to the story.Keitel does some teapot acting here, because the scenes are too static for his style. `Holy Smoke' is the sort of thing where he really shines. Penn was much better in `Short Cuts,' Roth was way better in `Vincent and Theo' and more self-referential in `Rosencrantz.' (I'll admit that this is Tierney's best role.) The folded time bit is Tarantino's strength and it is done well here. But it is hardly original and has been done better by others. Of recent Hollywood films, `Out of Sight' and `Snake Eyes' are more artful and more integrated respectively.My point is that Tarantino doesn't walk on water. This film is not original but a bunch of ideas from others cleverly bonded. It does not deserve the IMDB ranking in the top 250. Dogs DID change Hollywood -- not because of its art but its economics. Think `Blair Witch,' or `Easy Rider' if you prefer a film from a wunderkind."
"Reservoir Dogs was a complete disappointment. Despite the hyped reviews and high rating on IMDb it was nothing special. Mostly consisting of dialogue of pointless banter between the characters dragging out for uncomfortable amounts of time, the story had a weak plot and built up to nothing. Although to be fair the acting was very good, it did not redeem the overall poor script and plot which has its audience checking their watches within the first 30mins. The violence factor was nothing that shocking either, nothing much more you would find in a Bond film. Personally I do not understand how this film gets good reviews. Please do not be fooled into wasting your time with this bore of a film. I'm surprised that this was not a career-ender for Tarantino.2/10 Good acting, very boring plot. Overall poor."
"I heard so many good things about this movie before I finally saw it, and I was misled. With a shorter running time, it seemed like there was an attempt to pack in a vast amount of plot, but it ended up seeming like more time was wasted because of it.With such a fine cast, I was expecting some fine performances. I wasn't disappointed as far as that goes. I'll admit the variety of characters was interesting and fun to watch at times, most notably during the first scene. That's about all it has to offer though.The basic concept of strangers getting together for a crime isn't a bad idea on paper, it just didn't work out at all for this script. I kept hoping the writing would get better as the movie went on, but after about a third of the way through, I knew what I was in for.I really don't think there's anything groundbreaking here, even for 1992. Crime movies have been done, and been done better. This seemed more like a fantasy crime movie that would only be interesting to the person thinking about it in their own unique way.There's also some torture scene put in, which I really thought didn't need to be. It didn't seem like it fit in, at least to the extent of what happened. So what's the bottom line here? Well, it's crime movie with a semi interesting plot, a lot of tough guy talk, and an overall letdown of what could have been. 4/10"
"""I feel like a director who has not yet directed, therefore I don't exist."" Said an idealist, enthusiastic Quentin Tarantino back when he was working at Video Archives in the early 1990s, eager to start climbing the directorial ladder in Hollywood. At this time he was just a screenplay-writer, penning early works such as Natural Born Killers (a baby of his he felt he stabbed in the heart when he gave up to Oliver Stone to rewrite), True Romance and From Dusk Till Dawnall initially fruitless fares that no one dared to green-light. Production companies were choosy, cliquish and wouldn't give an untested director like Tarantino a break. Not even for Reservoir Dogs.Growing increasingly frustrated at navigating the world of hard-to-please production corporations to OK his project and pass him the director's chair, Taratino approached producer Lawrence Benderarguably the best choice of his career (he's been working closely with him ever since). Bender loved the script of Reservoir Dogsand who wouldn't? It pours crime, gangsters and humour into an exquisite blender and sprinkles it with heavy doses of edgy style. Together the two of them set out to do this film, and soon caught the eye of Richard Gladstein at Live Entertainment in Van Nuys, who would later agree to finance the little project.It really was a ""little"" project, too, with a budget of a mere $1,200,000which meant that the '65 Yellow Cadillac that you see in the film is Michael Madsen's own. Yet breathless and excited at becoming a debut-director and finally getting to tend to his baby himself which this position now afforded him, Quentin Tarantino and Lawrence Bender began the process and the mega cult hit that is ""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992). Harvey Keitel was first approached to star as Mr. White and with his name on-board, he himself convinced several star-actors to grace the cast list along with him. He told them they wouldn't get much money for it, but that the script alone was worth jumping on-board for. They agreed.That's some basic back-story for you on how this film came to be, and I feel it is important to keep in mind the fervent enthusiasm and gratitude with which Quentin Tarantino embarked on his debut-director journey. It translates in the eager, rapid-fire dialogue between the characters, the clever pacing of the story and the fresh edge of the narrative. This is a man with a deeply-rooted love for films and who wanted nothing more than to make his own--and now that privilege had been granted, and not a minute too soon. Upon the release of ""Dogs"", Tarantino was rightly vaulted into the great directors' fame and, I imagine, became even more enthusiastic about film-making.The end product is a very good film that sees five anonymous hit men team up for a big heist  an armed robbery on a Diamond warehouse that will be central to the wide variety of eccentrically quirky characters who all lend their skills to the job. The heat of the police clings onto them during this task because there's talk of a rat in their group... but who is it? The film starts at the end of the robbery, zooming in on a chaotic bloody state and then backtracks in flashbacksnon-chronologically and a bit babbling, but it still worksin an attempt to answer this question. Does it? Yes, but perhaps not in the way you think.Although this fare is devoid of any profound message, morals or statement and there's no discernible kind of symbolism, it is extremely enjoyable on a basic level. In fact, maybe its straightforward approach to a storybut with criminal diversions, twists and plot-devicesis what makes it so great. This is a clever heist, just take it or leave it. The interactions and actions between the characters are at focus, placing environment in the backseat; this means that Reservoir Dogs can proudly boast of having one of the greatest dialogue-driven scenes in film, and it takes place at the beginning at the diner when Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) explains to the other guys why he does not tip waitresses--the others are compassionate and argue that they are minimum-wage workers no rely on tip, but Mr. Pink is stern: ""Do you know what this is? Its the world's smallest violin playing just for the waitresses. ""The film is full of gems like these, full of great colourful gangster performances (in particular Michael Madsen as Mr. Blonde--the most badass character in history) and full of clear-eyed and gory style. As far as heist films go, this is a grand accomplishment. If anything, it is a bit short (99 minutes). These characters are so interesting that we never feel as though we get to know them enough--it's a little rushed and a little dizzying at times. This is no surprise as Reservoir Dogs was originally written as a short film, barely stretching 20 minutes and with characters that weren't meant to be particularly developed or dimensional. They are more so in the final, long version, but it's still a little too rushed. Although I suppose is intentional on Tarantino's part to signify the hectic pace of the heist and the cops chasing them.Tarantino sported a modest wallet and a modest ego that had not yet swelled to a ""Cro-Magnon forehead""--as ex-friend and Natural Born Killers producer Don Murphy would describe it--when he wrote and directed this film. Indeed, this aspiring filmmaker loved films so much that he would make a lot of enemies and lose a lot of friends during the course of climbing the directorial ladder in Hollywood. No friends were harmed in the making of this film.8/10"
"A grim action movie with OK actors and OK story, but it's not a masterpiece. Tarrantino seams to add extreme violence and blood in all his movies just to shock the audience around the world. His characters are to one-dimensional to my taste, and I think his style will be exposed as a cheap way to thrill in the future.""From dusk to dawn"" was mush better, see that one in stead."
"I know everyone seems to love this movie, but I just didn't like it!  I have enjoyed other movies by Tarantino and even loved the camp of From Dusk 'til Dawn, but this one just left me cold. I love Michael Madsen and Tim Roth, but they alone were not enough to carry the movie for me.  Maybe I just wasn't ready for this movie because I had just finished watching Glengarry Glen Ross beforehand.  The two combined were a deadly combination!"
"Now don't get me wrong, the film is alright, but its nowhere near as good as the cult following this film has makes it out to be. On the plus side, the cast is definetly great. All the principles are completely immersed in their roles, and give magnificent performances. However the directing does feel a bit amateurish at times, and the script is out and out weak. The story revolves around a botched diamond heist where the thieves involved suspect one of their own is a rat. I don't know if it was because of a small budget or just a weak script but the story doesnt come off as good as it sounds.For starters the film uses a very disjointed means of telling the story. However there's no real flow to it. Most of the movie is set in a warehouse after the robbery, with the charachters trying to figure out the snitch. You'd think the movie would build up to this fact, but it gets revealed midway through. Fair enough. In fact the part of the movie that goes into the snitch's story is probably the best part. So you'd think there'd be some really big conclusion instead, right? Not really. This film has got to have one of the weakest most abrubpt endings I've ever seen. Hell they never even actually show the robbery, which sounds interesting and is something i would have like to have seen as a viewer, but instead its only referred to. So, if you're really big on violent crime films, fine. Go ahead and give it a go, but be warned, its nothing compared to the work of, say, Guy Ritchie. And if you're just seeing this movie to find out what all the buzz is about, you're going to be really dissappointed. Go rent something like Jackie Brown or Snatch instead."
"I have to say- coming back to this film after so many years- it still packs a Tarantino punch. Very witty, edgy and gritty. Painful moments and perhaps some of the most violent scenes of our times. Not for the faint hearted but if you're into quirky badass gangster films, this one is for you."
"From the opening moments of ""Reservoir Dogs"" you sense that you are watching a different kind of crime drama. The style and dialog of this picture bestows a level of intelligence upon it's characters that defies the reality of their chosen profession. Having said that,this movie is absolutely riveting in it's movements from the ordinary, to the grim, to the horrific aspects of a career criminal. Quintin Tarantino has written a tale of an almost corporate order to constructing a crime gang. The delight is in meeting these characters one by one. The particular crime is no more crucial to the film than a 7-11 stick-up. The crux of the movie is the portrayal of the rainbow of characters who find themselves involved in a life of crime. Much has been made of the violence in the movie, but it only serves to point out that all men are different......even the crooked. The director has included a number of very memorable scenes. This is not a linear film. The movie works more as a series of set pieces that weave together a story that is not as important as the individual parts that you have the pleasure of observing. This movie may take more than one viewing to truly appreciate."
"""reservoir dogs"" is the perfect example of a movie that continues to receive praise albeit it deserves none of it.it is a weak rip-off of ringo lam's ""city on fire"" -- a bit of cinematographic education goes a long way and i recommend watching the original instead of this over-hyped puke.Tarantino has made two good movies during his career, ""pulp fiction"" and ""jackie brown"" ... other than that, he has proved to be a one-trick pony that recycles the same pattern over and over again.it is intriguing that people give this flick such high ratings, which leads to the conclusion that most of them are based on the lack of knowledge as to its history (of plagiarism)."
"Reservoir Dogs (1992) is a slow paced story-driven flick about a heist gone wrong.It's a Tarantino's movie, so go on for it knowing that: plot is not linear, there's a lot of swearing, acting is great, story is awesome. Enough said!"
"Wow! What can I say... the wife picked up this gem in a mad rush from the local video store. Which is to say she didn't read the cover jacket warning in time! Hence, we got to be intrigued and disgusted, pretty much in that order.I was OK with the dialogue, which is intriguing -- like one of those conversations where you're privy, but you don't open your yap because it's too damn interesting to interrupt.But, then things went horribly, horribly wrong. Now, don't get me wrong -- I like a good blood-spattered, pleading-victim, grinning-sociopath, sadistic torture scene as much as the next man. NOT! Apart from the rest of the blood and gore, which is excessive (much like watching open-heart surgery), the torture scene just got way too up close and personal for my taste.Reminds me of when we used to play 'Look!' You know, you chew up your food and say, ""Wanna play 'Look?'"" Then, you open your mouth to a disgusting view of partially-chewed carrots, peas and corn and scream 'Look!' If you're lucky, your little brother faints or at least heaves.Well, apparently Quentin seems to think this is a way cool technique in the cinema. Duct-tape the victim to a chair and pull out the old straight razor! 'Look!' Apparently, a lot of folks think Quentin is way cool, too, judging from the many favourable reviews of this gore-fest. And, wow he uses the 'N' word, too. He's sooo deep! This movie has a lot of interesting little novelties that are worth checking out. But, the gore is over the top. Have your finger on the fast-forward... and make sure the kids are in bed."
This movie was so boring and long I dont see why you guys like this so much. I rent this because of all the hype around it but it sucks. I know you will hate me for saying this but point break was better than this. Now the acting was good but it couldn't save this crap of a movie that you call a classic.
"So highly hyped yet totally fails to live up to any of it this debut film is remembered for all the wrong reasons: that L.A gangsters are cool, ""That"" scene and Mr T's inability to write a script that conveys anger, emotion or suspense without resorting to F words. Only the score can save it from the dustbin but the worst crime is that anyone now wearing black suits and shades is confused with this junk instead of The Blues Bros. In a word; A**e!"
"Whenever the name Quentin Tarantino is mentioned nowadays, people treat him with the same reverence as Scorsese, De Palma, and other directors as such who have fiddled around with the crime/gangster genre to create personal, heavy-duty masterworks.  However, at the time this film was first released, as was with his still best picture 'Pulp', he was regarded as a filmmaker who makes violent movies, filled with violence, chock full of violence, ""too violent"" (if there ever could or should be such a thing in movies), etc. This is unfair.  True, Tarantino writes and works his actors to such an intensity that the feelings that go with violent acts and violent tension is there, and true he shows the blood, he lets us hear the cries of agony and despair, and indeed there are times that bullets fired into people are shown as such right in frame.  Yet he never exactly displays any truly violent acts (he decided to leave the shot of Masden slicing the ear on the editing floor, unlike a director like David Lynch who gets right inside the matter) - his technique is to evoke and strive for all of the emotions one would feel in such asituation, movie or in real life, to the most honest, near heart-wrenching limits, and thus to someone who may have even not even seen the film the images that appear in a trailer or on a video box bring the notion of this being an overly violent movie immediately.  That the images we see throughout the film, bloody or not, stay with us long after the credits roll, is a testament to his dedication, and obvious trust, to his craft being as it is.The plot, while lifted from a Chow-Yun Fat film from the mid-eighties, is the first one to include his trademark non-linear storytelling design. Sure, this is not uncommon in most films, but since each scene has a meaty quality to it, with line after line of (purposeful, to story as well as character) dialog is spoken, you really don't know what to expect.  A crime boss (Lawrence Tierny) assembles different criminals of different backgrounds, removes them of their given Christian names, and gives them pseudonym colors as the heist comes up.  The robbery itself has a big hitch- cops are alerted sooner than thought, shoot-outs occur, some colors are wiped away, and the remaining assemble in the rendezvous to sort out what went wrong and who's to blame.  For most films with such an ambitious and grounded script, nearly every performance is a crucial asset to the film's success, and Tarantino knows this in his bones, as well as in the casting of the right parts (i.e. Steve Buscemi auditioned for Mr. White but got Mr. Pink, makes sense doesn't it): Keitel and Tierny are like old pros merely portraying old pros; Roth has a true breakout performance as Orange; Busemi himself proves why he's needed in film today; Chris Penn makes for a fine supporting role; Masden is one of the most convincing of the 90's psychos; even Tarantino makes a perfect monologue for himself in the opener.  Right away these actors give off the only impression they should - these are people that we can care about, despise, or watch in a lack of judgment as they float away in a flash - they've got to be human all the way.  So, is Reservoir Dogs for everyone?  Not necessarily- children under the age of nine or ten, I'd suggest, should stay away even if they can understand and take the violence since it's really an film for maturer mindsets.  But, for the passionate movie-goer, or for thrill seeking screen nuts, it's worth the ride.  For one thing, I'll never think of ""Stuck in the Middle With You"", or Steven Wright for that matter, the same way again.  My opinion- Tarantino's 3rd best effort behind Pulp Fiction and From Dusk Till Dawn, and nearly superior over Jackie Brown.  A+"
"** / **** Reservoir Dogs is an interesting beginning to one of America's finest filmmakers careers. I loved Pulp Fiction in so many ways but most of which came from the last 15 minutes of the film in which we understand Samuel L. Jackson's journey in the film. It is that quality that is missing in Reservoir Dogs that, in my opinion, is the film's failing. The film is nothing but graphic pain and violence. There is nothing to endear any of the characters to us (unless you are endeared to people that like to mutilate people to hip 70's tunes). The characters have no real journey. The dialog is inventive (as we expect from Tarantino) but the plot is not. It's about violence for the sake of shocking the audience. It's disturbing in the ways that a horror film is disturbing without the payoff in the end. The film is extremely popular and that disturbs me more than the film itself."
