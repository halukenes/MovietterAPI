"SPOILER: At the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival the film ""ROOM"" won the People's Choice Award today. It tells a story of a young woman and her five year old son who have been held in captivity in a confined and windowless living space for six years. Brie Larson stars as Ma and her son named Jack is played by Jacob Tremblay who is so believable that you will feel empathetic towards their captivity but relief as to how Ma convinces Jack that their little world is real and is wonderful. As Jack grows he starts to ask questions about their isolated lifestyle and we the audience anticipate that Ma must try and escape with young Jack but how?The story draws similarities to the actual events that were Jaycee Lee Dugard's true life story which occurred on June 10, 1991, in South Lake Tahoe, California. Dugard was 11 years old at the time she was abducted from a street while she was walking from home to a school bus stop and she was held captive for the next 18 years in a concealed back yard in a make shift shed. There is also some resemblance to the kidnapping of Amanda Berry who had a child fathered by her kidnapper Ariel Castro. This film was titled Cleveland Abduction and it was released in 2015. It tells the true story of three girls who were held captive for over 10 years by Ariel Castro in his home with no one aware how close the girls were to their own homes and families.The film Room focuses more on Jack and Ma's awkward adjustment to life outside of their room which was their entire world for the past six years. There is a strong supporting cast including performances such as Joan Allen's role as Jack's loving Grandma and the ever convincing all-star William H Macy as a resistant Grandpa who is having difficulty accepting that his daughter is raising her rapist's son. There are some scenes that are so heartwarming that it will be difficult not to find yourself becoming emotionally involved. In one particular very touching and loving scene, Jack asks his Grandma to cut his long hair so that the strength that he thinks that his shoulder length hair possesses can be transferred over to his sick Ma so she can return home from the hospital. Jack who understandably is initially withdrawn from anyone other than his Ma simply tells his Grandma after she washes and cuts his hair that he loves her. This loving scene between Jack and his Grandma will stay with me forever. Jack and Ma's is a story of isolation, fear, hopelessness versus hope and most importantly a film about redemption and the family bond. Room is deserving of an Oscar nomination for best picture and nominations in a few other categories as well such as best actress, best actor and best director. I give the film a 9.5 out of 10 rating. This film is terrific!!"
"Room (2015/I) was directed by Lenny Abrahamson. It stars Jacob Tremblay as Jack and Brie Larson as his mother (""Ma"")The situation becomes very clear early in the film. Jack and his mother are held captive by a man who has kidnapped her, raped her, impregnated her, and uses her as his sexual slave. Jack and his mother have lived in a small, locked shed, which they call ""Room."" Jack's mother has lived in ""Room"" since she was abducted seven years earlier. Jack has lived there for all of his life--five years.By incredible ingenuity, motivated by love, Ma has kept Jack from realizing the horrors of their situation. It's hard to believe that anyone could be so motivated and capable, allowing the boy to believe that his situation is normal, but it works in the film and you accept it.What happens next is pretty well known, but I won't go into it because it might decrease your enjoyment of the movie. It's dramatic, frightening, and, heart-wrenching, all at the same time.Brie Larson does a wonderful job as the mother, and Jacob Tremblay has to be the best child actor we have. He is absolutely brilliant. Director Abrahamson must be an extremely talented man to draw two such great performances from his actors.This is a must-see film, but it's not easy to watch. Even though Room wasn't based on any specific incident, we all know of cases of warped men who have kidnapped and enslaved women. It's hard to think about the lives of those women without becoming depressed. We saw the film at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. Given the claustrophobic atmosphere of the movie, it will work on the small screen as well. Seek it out and watch, but prepare yourself mentally before you begin."
"*Insert all 9 & 10 reviews here* I was in awe during the entire film. Lenny Abrahamson & the writing team made sure there was not one dull moment. The addition of ""insignificant"" characters and plot twists are later realized to be so significant and influential in keeping the film alive throughout its duration. It was the little things that made this story one of the best I've seen in a long time. I experienced an entire palette of emotions all at once and was left in a deep level of curiosity and reflection. Very few films have the power to continue to influence its audience after the credits. Room is endless in the most beautiful way."
"Room is a harrowing thriller, but not in the traditional sense of the word. It deals with a dark subject matter and the first half of the film can be quite disturbing. Yet director Lenny Abrahamson (Frank) has adapted the best-selling novel with grace and grandeur. Here is a film so artistically unique and deviant, chock full of genuine emotion thanks to two outstanding performances, that isn't afraid to take risks and surprise at every turn.Based on the novel by Emma Donoghue, Room introduces us to Ma and Jack, a mother and son held captive in a garden shed. As we learn more about their captivity, their world becomes clearer and clearer to us. They live by a routine, have names for every object in room, and Ma must be careful as her son grows older and more curious.The film is structured into two halves, and by now it's no spoiler that the second half deals with their readjustment into the outside world, and Jack's first time outside of room. The film is thematically complex, yet never overwhelming. At its core it's about motherhood, but Jack's unique upbringing complicates things.Director Lenny Abrahamson is no stranger to the strange, and with Room he's made a masterpiece of filmmaking. The entire idea of 'room,' the abstract concept of space, is ever-present in the production. In their bubble of room, Ma and Jack are restricted, as evident by Abrahamson's close angles and tight shots. The small space allows for high concept filmmaking, and when they get out of room, it only gets better, with a new color palette and experimental camera angles through Jack's eyes. The entire film is seen through the eyes of this child, and it's genius. What I loved about the book was its focus on Jack and how he adjusts to seeing this new world for the first time, and the movie never loses sight of that.I wrote about the pressure placed on child actors in my review for the incredible Beasts of No Nation, and Jacob Tremblay fits like a glove. Like Abraham Attah, he isn't a child actor, but an actor who just happens to be of a younger age. His wide eyes and expressive thoughts are very believable, and when he sees the outside world for the first time, it's a thing of beauty. Tremblay has brilliant chemistry with Brie Larson, and for one second I never doubted her devotion to him. As Ma faces frustrating upon leaving room, from her parents, doctors, and the media, she never forgets her son Jack, and always puts his wellbeing first. Larson taps into this character, one that undergoes a stunning transformation as she basically lost seven years of her life being locked up. Her performance will blow you away.The best actors are the ones able to transport you into their characters' own universes, no matter how isolated from society they happen to be. Larson, Tremblay, and Joan Allen all have a tremendous range of emotional ability and are able to sell you on their story not just for two hours, but for an entire lifetime. With Room, Abrahamson goes the extra mile with his direction, and director of photography Danny Cohen keeps all eyes on Jack. The film asks us to examine how we view the world and how this viewpoint is shaped by our nurtured upbringing. The result is a breathtaking experience brought to life, one you won't soon forget."
"""Room"" is an adaption of an internationally best-seller novel written by Irish playwright and novelist, Emma Donoghue. This is her first book to be adapted into a major motion picture and I have to say that it is a rather impressive one. I have not read Emma's novel yet, but I can only guess that this movie sticks to the novel's roots, considering that Emma decided to write the screenplay herself. Room is a story about a women who was kidnapped during her high school years and locked in a shed for 7 years. She was impregnated by her kidnapper in this room and was locked inside with the child. The child grows up and around the age of five is when the movie picks up. Throughout this entire movie we are taken through this story strictly from the Jack's (the child) point of view. Even though this story is experienced through the lens of this child, the story is in no way filtered or gussied up. It is this intimate and raw story about a child and his mother spending a hugely relevant portion of their existence stuck in this dull, dirty and claustrophobia-inducing shed. This shed contained one small window that emits a tiny portion of daylight into the room. To me, this represented a light at the end of the tunnel. Sort of like a tiny glimmer of hope in a deep and dark abyss. Throughout this entire movie, Jack narrates his experiences as he embarks upon the world. Jacob Trembley portrays this character with such a sense of wonder and innocence that every single narration that I hear from this boy is just heartbreaking. Every time Jack takes away something from the world, he takes it in as something new and exciting even if it is scary. They are things that everyone takes for granted everyday: trees, dogs, the sky, etc. You would think that the dramatic climax would be at the beginning when Jack gets out of the tiny room he has been locked in his entire life, but after-wards, this film just drags in one dramatic scene after another in a way that turns this film into one big heartache an experience. I do have say that Jacob Trembley and Allison Brie's performances carry a lot of the weight of this film. Allison gives a very natural and organic performance. You never catch her overacting or being too stiff during any scene in this movie. Jack Trembley gave one of the most, if not the most, impressive performances of the year. Not just because of his age, but because of how well of a dramatic performance that he gives without over or underacting in any of his scenes. He seemed to take his role with a very adult-like seriousness that translated into a lot of the movie's themes of innocence that are chased by the persistent and harsh reality that Jack and his mother are facing. The directing and cinematography in this film are beautiful. The film's intense theme is complimented with a variety of out-of- focus and close up shots that highlight the child's immediate consciousness as he takes the outside world with fresh- eyes. Many of the scenes are also complimented by a beautiful and breathtaking film score composed by the award-winning Stephen Rennicks who has been crafting soundtracks in the indie film world since 1997. Overall, this is a film that I won't be forgetting for the rest of my life. Mainly because it is a film about escaping outside of the room that you have been stuck in your whole life and discovering a world that has been hidden from you. I know that sounds kind of cheesy but this film does it in the most grounded and intense way possible. Not to mention that it is dosed with themes of abandonment, human-kindness, and media exploitation. I don't usually give films a 10/10. As a matter of fact, I could probably count the films this year that I do consider 10s on one hand. The films I consider perfect are life changing in some way or benchmarks in cinematic history. While this film will probably be washed away by the ever expanding ocean that is cinema, it is not a movie that I will be personally ever forgetting. I can't remember watching a film that made me feel so grateful for just being alive."
"Lenny Abrahamson's Room opens in a 10 x 10 room that has no windows, a locked door, and no light other than that provided by an overhead skylight. Jack (Jacob Tremblay), a slight five-year old boy with hair down to his shoulders wakes up each morning as he has all his life, saying hello to his world. He says hello, not to the sun or the grass outside his front door where he can run and laugh and play but only to the objects which is all his world consists of: the lamp, the sink, the plant, the refrigerator. His only friend is a mouse that he feeds with some pleasure.Not that he lacks for companionship. Ma (Brie Larson) is with him and their endless days consist of cooking, reading, and watching TV where Jack is told that what he sees on the screen is not real, only pretend. All he knows of the world is what he sees in front of his eyes. Old Nick (Sean Bridgers) brings food and other household items but when he comes, Jack has to hide in his wardrobe, out of sight. Ma, we find out, has been kept prisoner and used for sex by the hulking man who comes every night and we know that Jack is a result of his mother's rape. Jack is the focus of the film and we see everything from his point of view, with the help of his sometime narration but we can also get into his mother's mind and feel her pain and live her dreams.There is never any doubt of his mother's love though the obvious strain of keeping herself from crying out every minute is painfully obvious. To Jack, she is the center of his world and his reason for being. When the second half of the film takes a surprising turn and shifts 180 degrees, Jack and Ma are not prepared for what awaits them. Even when an alternative is suggested as possible, he doesn't want to hear anything about a different world with blue sky and rivers and trees. Room is a tense and compelling film in which Brie Larson more than fulfills the brilliance that she showed in Short Term 12 and should make her an Oscar contender. Tremblay is also superb.He lives his character and makes him come alive, even though he is only nine years old. Supporting roles by Joan Allen and William H. Macy also contribute to the film's second half but it is always Larson and Tremblay that carry the day. The film is not mawkish or sentimental even though the soaring score by Stephen Rennicks comes close. While there are has some plot implausibilities, the film is a tribute to the resiliency and the dedicated love of a parent for their child. It is also a teaching experience. Like many who are walled off from each other and think the box they are in is all there is, the film can give us the combination to open the locked door, if we take the risk to turn the key."
"I know one thing, I will never, ever forget this heartrending, unbelievably-acted 'movie' for the rest of my days. I'm just at a loss for words and struggling to describe how truly powerful and heart-grabbing this story was. I'll go so far as to say that if you don't cry, shed a tear, or feel the urge to weep profusely after (or while) watching Room, you don't have a heart. The mother (Brie Larson) and her son (Jacob Tremblay, 9 years old!) carry this entire movie. The beauty of Room is in its bare rawness, realness and universally relatable nature. What can I say? It tapped into something deep, deep, deep within me and just ripped my heart to shreds and had me in tears; sometimes tears of sadness, and other times tears of heavenly joy. It made me smile at times and even laugh. But most of all, it always had my eyes glued to the screen and my soul enthralled by what I was witnessing. This is one of the best, truly real stories ever told and one of the best uses of cinema I've ever seen. ...Try not to read much/anything about it before going in to see it (and yes, definitely catch it in a theater near you ASAP). Go in and be engrossed and moved (in ways I can't describe) by this experience. 10/10 *Hands down* the best film of 2015, and the single best thing I've seen in years. :')"
"Based on the novel of the same name by Emma Donoghue, 'Room' is a challenging, unsettling, harrowing film, that leaves you disturbed. But that is its sheer power. The Incredible Performances only add to the film's hefty nature.'Room' Synopsis: After five-year-old Jack and his mother escape from the enclosed surroundings that Jack has known his entire life, the boy makes a thrilling discovery: the outside world.'Room' is a disturbing story about bad things that happen to good people. But its also about hope & fighting back. Its shocking to see the protagonist, a child, discover the world along-with his brave mother, who survived a harrowing experience. I was engrossed & often disturbed by the narrative, especially after the son & mother escape. The series of events that follow are so gut-wrenching, I almost broke down.'Room' is masterfully penned by Emma Donoghue herself. The Writing is consistently powerful & the dialogue are realistic to the core. Lenny Abrahamson's Direction is first-class. He has handled this dramatic, unsettling tale with complete flourish. Cinematography is perfectly claustrophobic. Editing is razor-crisp. Art Design is skilfully done.Performance-Wise: Brie Larson & Jacob Tremblay deliver incredible performances. Brie is astounding as the tormented, yet brave protagonist, while Jacob steals the show with a flawless performance. The child does wonders & makes 'Room' unforgettable. Of the supporting cast, Joan Allen & The Always Solid William H. Macy leave a solid mark.On the whole, 'Room' is a must watch! Its certainly unsettling, but its power is undeniable."
"Room, based on the book by Emma Donoghue, starts on young Jack's 5th birthday. He gets a birthday cake from his mother (but no candles); a visit from his father; and a gift, albeit belatedly. This would all be perfectly normal except that all of this takes place within 'Room' - a confined space with only a single skylight for daylight and no means of escape. For the mother, Joy, was abducted as a teen and locked away for sex in the style of the dreadful real-life examples such as that perpetrated by Josef Fritzl in Austria. Jack is the (presumably) unintended result: a boy with no perception of the real world beyond his four single-sided walls and with the staunchly-held view that the things he sees on a flickering TV screen are in 'TV land' and unreal. Will Jack and Joy survive and ever see freedom again? And that's where I'll leave this synopsis, since (if you've been lucky enough to avoid the trailer) there is a tense cat-and-mouse story to unfurl here.This is an absorbing, although slow-moving, film that builds to some truly nail-biting moments. The screenwriter (also Donoghue) and director (Irishman Lenny ""Frank"" Abrahamson) are to be commended in keeping the story and drama really well-grounded and un-saccharined. Old Nick (Sean Bridgers), the 'evil kidnapper', is not painted as some predictable monster: he is even portrayed to be kind and caring at some warped level. And there is no gratuitous sex: we are in effect seven years into the story and the abnormal is now completely normalised.The film is told primarily from the viewpoint of Jack (Jacob Tremblay) but we also get under the skin of Joy (Brie Larson) and her emotions in trying to mentally deal with her ordeal. Looking at a picture of her with her school friends she bitterly comments that ""Nothing happened to them - - they just got on with their lives"".The acting is superb. I made the mistake of voting for John Boyega for the BAFTA Rising Star award before seeing this film (you can cast your vote here http://www.bafta.org/film/awards/ee-rising-star-award-in-2016). Not that Boyega isn't great, but Brie Larson really REALLY delivers here. She obviously won't give a hoot if she wins the Best Actress Oscar! And for me, for this award, she shines out in what I would perhaps see as one of this year's weaker Oscar categories. Jacob Tremblay is also exceptional as Jack - and it would be nice (rather than try to compare young performances with adult ones, as per Anna Paquin) if there was a special awards category for actors and actresses under 10. If there was, then Tremblay would storm it! You seriously forget that this is a child acting a part. He is totally connected to the role and these two core performances lock in your belief in the story.Supporting the cast are the ever reliable William H Macy as Joy's mentally tortured father, Joan Allen (Pamela Landy from the ""Bourne"" films) as her equally distraught mother and Sean Bridgers as the kidnapper.At 2 hours long some of the scenes in the middle of the film made my attention waver a little. But my main criticism is in the trailer and marketing of the film. If ever there was a need for a true 'teaser trailer' this is it. I never know who is responsible for putting trailers together - whether the director has the final say or whether its some nameless marketing bods in the distribution company, but whoever it is they should be taken out and 'given a good talking to' for this travesty. It's like putting all of the twists in films like ""The Crying Game"", ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Gone Girl"" in their respective trailers. I've gone so far as to create my own One Mann's Movies cut of the trailer, just for you good people, which I have included with my bob-the-movie-man.com version of this review.A leisurely, nuanced and effecting drama, this is not for fans of ""Die Hard"" or ""Fast and Furious"" fans. But for everyone else, this should be a must see.Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review. Thanks."
"I haven't seen a genuinely emotional, smart, non-manipulative, heart- felt drama in a loooong time. Brie Larson deservedly won an Oscar for her performance in this, but Room should've swept the board in every category.The film centres on a Mother and her five year old son, living inside just four walls, and it slowly transpires that she has been held captive for seven years, and had a child by her kidnapper. She creates a world for her son within their confines, not telling him the truth about their situation and what's outside until he's old enough to understand. After failed escape attempts in the past, but now with the help of her son, she gives freedom another try.There were moments in Room that were so intense that I barely breathed. It never feels inauthentic, and thanks to incredible acting, it's always believable. If you want a straight-up thriller of 'bad guy commits crime, bad guy gets comeuppance', you'll be disappointed. This is about human resilience, the bond between Mother and child, selflessness, and finding your place in the world after having your understanding of it flipped upside down."
"Don't listen to the haters or those that want to chip away at the overall brilliance of 'Room'. What film doesn't have small flaws, they pale into insignificance during the 2 hours of continuous emotional maelstrom that follows. This film wrings every last drop of emotion and drama out of the allotted playtime. Make no mistake, despite short bursts of touching serenity, this films starts up full throttle and doesn't let-up. I can only assume reviewers here scoring this film 8 or less must be Vulcan by birth, or just terminally insensitive. This is a first rate drama with stand out performances all round. Especially from the child protagonist. **Warning** If you have trouble viewing emotionally charged material of a sensitive nature about abuse. You would be well advised not to view this film."
"That review summary may sound very oxymoronic, but to me it applies to a film such as 'Room'. A film with a difficult subject, that is the stuff of nightmares, but tells it so beautifully with an interesting approach that works better than all the potential traps that films of its genre could fall under.What could have easily have been told in a lurid, gratuitous way (being inspired by the true-life case of Josef Fritzl) is instead told in a careful and restrained way. There is even an innocence in 'Room', due to its very fascinating decision to tell it from the viewpoint of a five year old, in this case Jack, one that comes off very movingly and gives a sense that there is a little ray of hope in a seemingly hopeless situation. The source material, equally brilliant, is to be thanked here, its author Emily Donoghue adapts it to screen here and none of its power is lost. Really appreciated the careful and restrained approach to the storytelling in 'Room', and for me and many others it was something different considering the subject. It does though affect some of the pacing in the middle act, where a little of the tension seen in especially the first part is lost a little. For my tastes too, though it probably did fit the film's younger and more innocent viewpoint it's told from, the music score does lay it on too thick with the treacle.However, loved how the story was told and its approach. What 'Room' also strongly benefitted from being told this way was that the mother and son relationship was able to shine through and really resonate, which it may not have done as effectively with a heavier tone. And shine through it does, with great charm and poignancy. Also appreciated that none of the characters were painted too black and white, even Old Nick. Production values are effectively claustrophobic and the nocturnal parts chillingly nightmarish. 'Room' is beautifully directed by someone who understood how claustrophobic thrillers worked, how mother and son bonds do in dire situations do and the ability to combine both to ensure a powerful experience. A directing job that's both unsettling and empathetic. Similarly 'Room' is written with effortless skill and deft thoughtfulness. Can't find anything to fault the performances. The superb one of Brie Larson, that was a very worthy Oscar (Golden Globe and Bafta too) win in her category, is an obvious starting point, but one mustn't overlook the beyond-his-years turn of young Jacob Tremblay, one of the best child acting performances in recent years, and William H Macy and Joan Allen both giving some of their best work in years. Sean Bridgers also gives much more to what could have been a standard cliché role.Overall, great powerful film but the somewhat fascinatingly unconventional (for the genre) way the story was told won't work for some. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"Too many tears, too much sadness. Story of a teenager Ma kidnapped, raped and made a mom. And mom and son Jack locked in a room away from the world. Really sad when Jack said I don't want to be 5 I want to be 4. Even a 5 year old wants continued happiness in simplicity and in the arms of his only friend his own mother. He wants to be breast fed , he wants to shower with his Ma. He enjoys the only place he knows for his first 5 yrs of his life. There is no chaos from the real person he knows. Ma wants Jack to rescue them from the room. Life outside the room has its' own problems of tears, cries, fights.Excellent writing by Emma Donoghue who wrote the novel and the screenplay. Jacob Tremblay as Jack and Brie Larson as his mother Ma are terrific. Every scene, every dialogue has sincerity. Oscar worthy screenplay. Oscar worthy acting . Joan Allen as Ma's mom and Jack's grandma is perfect grandma, loving, caring, sensitive and excellent. Definite Oscar nominees. Jacob Tremblay , so young and so perfect in every scene."
"Room is based on the 2010 novel of the same name by the Irish turned Canadian novelist/playwright Emma Donoghue. The film has already garnered accolades from almost all critical quarters with heaps of approbation for its lead actress, Brie Larson. It's a rather uncomplicated story with a plot that is broken up into two distinct parts.For the first 45 minutes or so, a young mother, Joy, and five year old son, Jack, appear trapped in a small room where they've been residing for quite a long time. Eventually it's revealed we're watching a horror story: seven years earlier, when Joy was 17 years old, she was kidnapped by a neighborhood pervert, Old Nick, who has kept her prisoner in a shed next to his house. Old Nick makes what appear to be weekly visits bringing groceries but also rapes Joy whenever he comes over. There's no escape from the room that only has one skylight window since Old Nick is the only one who knows the numbers to the combination lock to enter.Jack is born as a result of Old Nick violating Joy and it's her son that's the only thing keeping her alive. The child does remarkably well despite growing up in such a deprived environment. Joy teaches Jack how to make a birthday cake and he plays with the limited amount of objects found in the room—occasionally Old Nick might bring the boy a present (such as an electric model car). There are of course tensions between mother and son—Joy doesn't react well when Jack throws a tantrum for example.The best part of the picture is the way in which Joy and Jack are rescued from this abominable situation--but unfortunately it's not all that believable. Joy's plan is to have Jack pretend that he's dead and instruct him how to escape from inside a rolled up rug after Old Nick drives away in his pickup to dispose of the ""body."" The entire escape is predicated on Old Nick's decision not to check to see if Jack is really dead—as the scene plays out, Old Nick inexplicably backs off after Joy screams at him not to look at Jack because (as she explains it to him), she can't stomach the idea of the pervert touching her dead son. The subsequent way in which Jack miraculously escapes from Old Nick's truck and the heart- pounding way in which the police figure out where the little boy came from, make up for the slow-moving turn of events in Act One.The second half of Room does not have the rising tension found in the first. The focus on how all the family members adjust is what the second half of Act Two is all about. Joy returns home to find her mother Nancy divorced from her father Robert, and now married to Leo. There is an underdeveloped subplot involving Robert who is repulsed by the idea that Jack was conceived through rape and that his father was pervert Old Nick. Robert goes home to an out of state residence and his catalog of resentments remain unexplored.A better subplot involves the intrusion of the media upon Joy and the rest of the family. Joy agrees to give an interview to a reporter for money and she asks her painful questions about what went on with Old Nick and whether she made the right decision in raising Jack and depriving him of a normal childhood (the suggestion is made that she could have convinced Old Nick to leave the newborn Jack anonymously at a hospital). Conflict develops between Joy and Nancy and eventually there's the rather predictable trope of Joy attempting suicide. Most critics found Jack's acclimation to his new found world to be touching and cathartic. When he bonds with Leo's dog and a new pal next door, all seems right with the world. And even Joy is seen getting herself together at film's end.So what is one to think of all this? It's a story that I suppose holds one's interest to the end; although the central twist (i.e. the escape), feels contrived. While the young Jacob Tremblay did a fine job playing Jack, his successful adjustment to the outside world feels to me much more schematic than cathartic, as many critics insist. As for Brie Larson, calls for her to win an Oscar for best actress seem misplaced--although her performance is fine given the pedestrian script.In the end, Room rises to the level of an average Lifetime movie, with a few interesting twists and turns here and there but more predictable elements making up the bulk of the overall proceedings."
"A poor kissing cousin to ""Stockholm, Pennsylvania,"" ""Room"" is a backyard shed creating the world's limits to a kidnapped young woman and her by-the-adbductor son.Snatched at seventeen, Joy (Brie Larson) is imprisoned for seven years by a standard, un-dimensional psycho holding the power of life and death over her. (Cross him in the least and there's no electricity or heat.) At the start, Joy's son, Jack (Jacob Tremblay), is angry and semi-feral yet quite content following silly rules in the only world he knows. Their pointless days come to an end when Joy contrives Jack's death forcing the psycho to bury the allegedly dead child. Well-rehearsed, Jack escapes and the dominoes fall leading to their escape to a world that has passed by Joy and one in which Jack has zero knowledge (a first encounter with steps mystifies him).Yellow ribbons and celebrations follow. With opposite effect. Joy's parents have divorced, high school chums have moved on. A formative slice of high school track star Joy's life is missing. Joy's biological dad harshly judges her; mom and daughter fight at the same level of a rebellious teen railing against parental control.Due to his age, Jack is 'plastic', his societal integration much easier. Soon he's knocking around a ball with neighbor kid. But, a reporter's insensitive question causes Joy to break down which leads to a brief institutionalization. And she's released all better.However, the treatment of an inherently dramatic subject matter of abduction and reintegration here falls short. The sunshine and rainbows, feel good ending, while moving, is mawkish. Everyone is healed and the horror of what was lived through for nearly a decade is forgotten. It is also a cheap device when children are wiser than adults. All these problems of the script.The balance of the failure of this film rests squarely on Brie Larson's shoulders. Her portrayal, as others, is at arms length with the character and hit a wall keeping her from connecting with feelings. Many crow her portrayal is spectacular. For her it is. In the annals of effective acting it is middling. Therefore, this is her tour de force - by default.""Stockholm, Pennsylvania"" took the protagonist's story to a far more logical, satisfying and shocking conclusion. On the base, sensational end of the spectrum, TV's ""Cleveland Abduction."" Find ""Room"" between the two. Either a good movie-of-the-week or poor indie sidestepping, and in some ways trivializing, a horrific subject.Watch ""Stockholm, Pennsylvania"" instead."
"Room stars Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. It offers Larson her best performance of her career and Tremblay a break out role. While he may not quite get past the whole ""kid actor"" stereotype he is admittedly better than almost every other child actor out there today. Both of these actors are receiving some serious awards buzz right now, as is this film in general. This may be due to the odd nature of its plot line. A mother and child are stuck inside a room for at least five years of their lives. Trapped inside never once going out to see or experience the world. So, when they get out we watch as this child gets to see everything for the first time.Yes it's an interesting plot that hasn't really been done before but it can't really pull it off. It's odd that it struggles so bad with making this a worthy adaption of the book seeing as the author actually wrote the film. Much like last years 'Gone Girl'. However 'Gone Girl' actually had a good director.The one other film this director had done was 'Frank'. So I had high hopes for this film. Unfortunately, he may have proved to us that he is a one hit wonder. Because this film is not near as good as everyone is saying. This mainly steams from sloppy writing. Writing that would've probably worked in a book format. In that format you are able to show characters thoughts and feelings far easier than in film so you have to write accordingly.But this doesn't happen. This is really the only reason this film fails. But it fails hard. From the first scenes of the film it was pretty clear that not enough thought went into making this a piece of cinema. Characters actions and reactions to everything feel absurdly artificial. Like a cop figuring out where the room they lived in was from one extremely vague sentence. Or how the film seems to pretend like these two had never made one single escape attempt.Literally the second escape they try gets them out. I couldn't help think that they had never actually tried, because the guy didn't even hesitate to buy into their trick. In fact not one person in this film reacts naturally. Everyone was an extreme version of a normal person and it made nearly everyone in the film super unlikable. Especially the main two characters. They did virtually nothing aside from scream at whoever they wanted for no apparent reason. Almost every conversation ended in an annoying screaming match between random people. A screaming match that either made no sense or just made you dislike the characters. So, when these two get out it's hard to legitimately care about them. You don't know anything about them other then the fact that they liked yelling for no reason.'Room' may have strong performances and an interesting idea to back it up but not much else. It has a hard time making you actually care about its characters. No one reacts like a human being but instead yells at each other when ever they feel like they need to. It wastes its best qualities with a limp and lifeless script that fails to appropriately adapt the acclaimed novel."
"It's hard to get revenge on a bad movie. I am partially consoled considering I snuck into this theater rather than paying for a ticket. Still, this subversion robbed me of the cathartic argument over my refund with some hapless manager. Room stole two hours of my life, and the only way I am going to get value from that experience is to get the last word. Room has an extremely fertile premise. An unnamed woman (Brie Larson) has been kidnapped and imprisoned in a shed for seven years, five of which she has spent raising her son Jack (Jacob Tremblay). I am unaware how the book navigated this premise, but author and screenwriter Emma Donoghue had a bottomless potential of directions and selected none. The writing is too shallow to be a thought experiment on trauma or a character study. The narrative is too muddled by loose ends to be a simple ""feel good"" movie. Cult classic The Room had a similar degree of cohesion yeah okay no it didn't. Poor contractually obligated jokes aside, Room is simply aimless. This child grows up in a 10x10 room surrounded by sexual abuse his entire life and his lone complications are a paleness, shyness, and poor grammar. I have met children with comparable behavior from normal households. Children might be plastic, but no one is going to manage a full swift recovery from being born into this environment. The mother character is better explored, but barely. The strength of this woman while kidnapped is unbelievable, but interesting questions are raised after the escape. Her relationship with her parents, her friends, and dealing with new realties are all introduced and either dropped or solved off screen. This is a device derived from the book where everything is seen through Jack's perspective. But post-escape Jack is just cute and boring, not worth following. His narration of events is insufferable. The conclusion of Room is sickening. The film has the audacity to propose that mother and son will be able to leave this experience behind in the closing moments. This claim is beyond ignorant and well into insulting.For the sake of critical fairness I will mention all the two and a half things I enjoyed. The escape sequence is genuinely thrilling. Putting a child in peril is often a cheap way to manipulate the audience. It worked here, so credit is due. Second, the cinematography in the room itself was surprising. I think most films would have tried for a more claustrophobic. Instead, the dimensions are simply defined and unjudged. The abrupt camera pans while Jack is running from wall to wall brilliantly reflects the mindset of these trapped characters. This place is simultaneously small and their entire world; traversing the room is trivial, but also the greatest possible distance. The one victory achieved by the closing scene is the brief moment perfect perspective when the room is seen from the outside. Finally, the acting was serviceable. It is hard to completely differentiate the awful roles from performances, but the film did dodge some melodrama. The Oscars successfully suckered me into watching Room. I would like to just chuck this movie atop a pile of other examples where the illustrious academy failed, but I am apparently in the minority. There are some aspects of quality filmmaking here, but there is no prize for best drama for housewives. Room took a premise ripe with potential and failed to nurture it with a drop of ingenuity or realism. I was disappointed, and I refuse to believe I am the only one."
"I usually trust RottenTomatoes and IMDb ratings, and while I might watch something that gets a 60% rating or above if the subject interests me, I will usually fall in line with the critics and reviewers on any movie that gets a 97% on RT or such high scores on IMDb. Well, this movie completely shattered my entire belief system, to the point where I find myself without a guiding light for the future.Many better worded reviews on this site have already captured the grievances that I had with this film, but I must write mine out so that I can feel better and move on with my life...It felt like it was 3 hours long. In an unbelievable feat of cinematography, they managed to stretch time so that a 2 hour movie felt like 3. The could have condensed the film into an hour and 20 minutes and I would felt less cheated. Outside of a short plot line, *nothing* happened. And every single thread that could have been interesting to develop was cut short leaving us unsatisfied and wondering. It's a movie about nothing. There was no great insight into the human cause or suffering, no great insight into the psyche of the captor, no details on the parental breakup, no real role given to the very interesting characters of the girl's real father or her mom's new husband. The girl was a b*tch (I mean, that's forgivable given the circumstances), but outside of sympathy for her, it was not entertaining to connect with her on any level. And every single time anything got interesting in the movie the scene ended.The real life is a lot scarier and way more touching than this movie, and unless one lives in a room, turning on the news every day brings a lot more real emotion and watching a poorly constructed movie with a very minimal depth is not that touching. What can we learn from a 5 year old and his view on the world? That could be interesting to see, sure, but even here, the monologues were short and infantile (because what would you expect from a 5 year old?) Jack was no great thinker at a young age. Yes, the world is full of wonder on the outside, whether you're 5 or 85.Perhaps it was a movie for those whose view on life has gotten so complacent that they lost any sense of that wonderment and listening to an annoying 5 year old describe his first experiences in the real world outside of his room brought them to tears because of nostalgia or remembering their own childhood innocence. Clearly, I am one of the few against the world who Loved this movie, so I'll be the first to admit defeat.Now, however, I'm left to scratch my head and re-evaluate my relationship with movie reviews."
"There is a lot to admire about this film. The direction in the first hour and the final minutes, especially gets the most out of the concept and manages to make a 10 by 10 foot space seem like everything and eventually nothing. Likewise, the direction leaves much of the horror to the imagination and it is all the more chilling as a result. The screenplay is sparse and spartan in the way real life is around such horrific events. I like that several of the tensions in the story, i.e. grandfather's inability to deal with his grandson, are left unresolved. Finally Larson gives one hell of an understated, yet raw, performance that elevates the already strong material.But much credit has to be given to Jacob Tremblay as well as the director for producing one of the finest, if not the finest, child performances of all time. I haven't seen a child actor as natural and real since at least Justin Henry in Kramer vs Kramer 40+ years ago. Tremblay has no artifice or pretension at all. Jack isn't cloying and so much of the emotional power comes from that character. It would be a remarkable performance no matter what but Jack is a hard character to play. Strictly speaking, Jack is the protagonist and it is his story-the movie at its core is a coming of age tale (abet a messed up one). The scenario that Jack is in is just hard for any person to really sell, let alone a child actor. It is a very good performance.This is a good movie. It is hopeful in the end but it is intense."
"This is one of those movies that the IMDb rating tricks you into believing is better than it actually is. The IMDb synopsis also makes you believe that you are being taken on a journey - of the struggles of being held captive, into the psyche of the captor, of the innocence of childhood, of motherly love that triumphs. You probably imagine some sort of ""Life is Beautiful"" unfolding in a room. But NO! Be warned. This movie is about an annoying kid and his annoyed mom stuck in a room. They both manage to escape the room and guess what? They continue to be annoying and annoyed. The characters are so completely one dimensional, the movie fails to both entertain or be insightful. You end up feeling stuck with the characters in this 2 hour long ordeal. Like someone dragging a fingernail on a chalkboard. The quickly made TV documentaries after kidnapped victims are rescued (as in the case of Elizabeth Smart or Amanda Berry) look like Oscar winning stories in contrast and are actually watchable. This movie is plain painful to watch."
"A beautifully told story through the eyes of a brilliant 5 year old. Such innocence beautifully portrayed.Great performances, a good film. Nothing more.I have a few issues with this film1) Would the mother trust her child with a man who was willing to keep them captive for so many years? 2) How lucky, Old Nick put the rug on the right hand side of the truck, meaning Jack could roll out to the left as practiced.3) Why would Old Nick just drop Jack like that?4) It took all of 30 mins to locate both the room and Old Nick.5) Surely wouldn't Jack & Ma have more psychology damage?"
"A woman and her son are held in a garden shed, referred to as 'room', by a man who uses the woman as his sex slave, having abducted her 7 years earlier. The woman concocts a plan to smuggle the son out in order for him to find help and free them. After the plan is successfully executed, we follow the two in the aftermath of the ordeal, struggling to retrieve the life that was previously stolen from her.The film is repetitive and annoying. At no point is the captivity nor the woman's response to the situation believable. It's just a garden shed located in some suburb instead of underground. The woman's not shackled and can virtually escape every time the captor enters the room. Relying on child actors is a notoriously shaky endeavour and again the constant whining of the kid and the way it talks, is grating and tiresome. There also seems to be no real connect between the first and second act. The 7 years she previously spent in the room might just as well have been a written premise at the start of the film. With no deeper layers to the film and with no character really fleshed out, the film feels aimless and not well thought-through.3/10"
"I just wanted to add my thoughts here because, as great as some of the movie undeniably was, I felt the balance was all wrong. Once they had escaped, with barely half the running time elapsed, all the tension went out of the film. I was sitting there thinking - okay, so what is going to happen to fill the next fifty minutes? The answer? Pretty much nothing, sadly.Don't get me wrong, the final scene was very moving, but I still got the feeling that the movie peaked during the escape and then just sort of ambled around for the remainder. which is a great shame, because I was really enjoying it up until that point, not least the stunning turn from the young actor playing the kid.I think I understand what the film was trying to achieve in being structured the way that it was, it just didn't work for me personally. I'm actually quite a fan of non-linear plots, and maybe that's something that would have enabled the director to keep building the tension to the very end whilst still showing us the aftermath of the ordeal."
"In 'Room', there are lots of things we don't see. We don't see how the lead character, Joy, is raped by her abductor who keeps her imprisoned for more than five years with her little son Jack. We don't see how she is liberated by the police, after she manages to let her son escape. We don't see what happens to her abductor and rapist.The director doesn't show all these things, because they distract from the theme of this movie: the way mother and son cope with their freedom. The surprising thing about this film is that this freedom turns out to be rather problematic in a lot of ways. Even so much so, that Jack starts to long for the intimacy and the routine of life inside the shed he called Room.The film shows how life in Room is claustrophobic, but also intimate and familiar. There are no unexpected developments in Room, but there is a lot of love between mother and son. Once they escape Room, everything changes. For Jack, who has never known a world outside Room, this is very threatening. He has to share his mother's attention with other people, he has to get used to all sorts of impulses, he has to learn how things like a telephone work.In this film, there is only one major dramatic event: Jack's escape and the subsequent liberation of his mother Joy. The rest of the film is rather uneventful: at first we see Joy and Jack in their daily routine in Room, and afterward we see them cope with all sorts of problems in the house of Joy's parents. Still, the film is almost never boring. The psychological developments make up for the lack of real action. And although there quite some emotional scenes, the director didn't make an outright tearjerker."
"This is a drama film about a mother and five-year-old son who are held prisoner in their captor's shed. The child escapes and the mother is rescued. Then we see them reunited with their family.The acting is good. The huge deficiency of the film is that it starts towards the end of the victims' false imprisonment. They've been there for all of the son's life - and the mother has been there for two years previous to that, since being kidnapped. We don't see any of those years, the kidnapping, or any of the mother's life before she was kidnapped. We see very little of the captor.It's not believable that the captor would believe the story that the mother uses to allow the son to escape.The poster - showing the mother and son smiling at each other - misled us into believing that it's a feel-good film. Being left with PTSD and your rapist-kidnapper-captor's child isn't a happy ending."
"This is the movie that happens every year that isn't good, but wins critical acclaim by being distinct and including a child actor. It's disturbing, but without the tact required by the writing.Now to spoil things. A woman is held hostage as a sex slave for seven years and at some point has a baby boy, who she convinces the ""Room"" is the entire world. During this they play uplifting music and it is absolutely tonally daft. Once they escape Room they are better off. Then, ""Ma"" feels bad about how horribly she treated her son and thus tries to kill herself, to make it all better.Also, the boy in this movie looks and sounds exactly like a girl and has long hair. So I'm expecting maybe ""Ma"" lied that it was a boy, so her kid wouldn't be a rape target. Nope. Toward the end you realize it's a boy, and you go, ""Whoa, why was I distracted by that for absolutely no reason?""Then, they revisit Room. And Ma feels better. Because going to where you were repeated raped for seven years makes you happy. Absurd, ridiculous, fantastical film that is unintentionally insulting."
"I had never heard about this movie (or the book on which is based) until I got a call from my cousin inviting me to see it. When I heard its name, my first reaction was ""is it a horror movie?"". And she explained that it wasn't and told me briefly the story. I'll try to tell as little as I can, because I believe one of the reasons this film had such a huge impact on me was precisely my lack of previous knowledge.Jack (Jacob Tremblay), a five-year old boy, lives with his mother Joy (Brie Larson) in a tiny room in precarious conditions. The boy has very long hair, is still breastfed, and sleeps inside the closet. Soon you realize they are not there by option: Joy was kidnapped 7 years before and Jack was born there, inside that room, which he believes to be the only thing that exists in the world. He has absolutely no idea that there is an ""outside"" behind the door.I had all the possible emotions while watching Room. I was sad, happy, angry, and nervous (almost having a heart attack during an specific scene). Even my cousin was on the edge of her seat and she already knew what was going to happen.Everything in this film is great, starting with the cast. Brie Larson is so perfect with her portrayal of a young woman who has been through such a trauma that I strongly believe she has real chances to be awarded for this role. Her character is so complex and she's able to transmit to us the sadness due to the situation and the happiness for having her son with her. And, of course, the boy! Jacob Tremblay is perfect and you can't help but feel both sorry and sympathetic towards him. He is so genuinely naïve and oblivious of the bad (and good) things in the world that is impossible not to like him.Full review: http://wp.me/p5Rk4c-fB"
"At the start of Room, a young woman and her five-year-old son are living in the titular edifice, a backyard shed. The woman (Brie Larson) has always told Jack (Jacob Tremblay) that ""outer space"" is all that exists outside Room; as far as Jack is concerned, this is the gospel truth and the universe consists of Room and Room alone.It is not giving anything away to note that Ma and Jack escape Room, as the movie is more about the ability of each to cope with the outside world. For Jack, every step and every breath outside is a wholly new experience. Ma, despite having lived for 17 years before coming to Room, encounters different obstacles – the world has moved on, and she doubts her own ability as a mother to Jack.I had been expecting a suspenseful drama-thriller about a daring escape, given the various synopses I'd read. (The movie is based on a novel by Emma Donoghue, which is itself loosely based on real events.) Much of the first half of the film, though, concentrates on life inside Room for Ma and Jack. Ma uses her strong will and infinite patience to convince Jack for five years that all is well and that what they have is a normal life, that what they see on television is not real, but everything from the single bed to the lidless toilet tank is definitely real. Ma sacrifices as much as she can to keep Jack happy and (relatively) safe, even to the point of giving herself over to her captor on a regular basis in exchange for food and other items for Jack and herself.To say that this first half moves slowly would be to understate things. We don't just get a slice of the life that the duo leads; we get the entire pie, and most of it just isn't all that exciting or intriguing. We do get to see a little into the characters of the characters, pardon the phrasing. We see that Jack doesn't like to not get his way or to have his worldview challenged. Then again, who does at age 5? We see that Ma is often calm but firm with her young charge. It's a small Room, after all; no need to go nuclear when there's really no point to it. In any event, much time is spent watching their everyday sheltered lives. Because the general plot involved their lives beyond Room, I began to grow impatient: Were they going to spend the entire movie in Room, only to escape in the final minutes? Why wouldn't anything happen? The fact that Ma and Jack would eventually escape left the first half of the movie perfectly devoid of suspense. Although still waters do often run deep, I didn't really feel like I was getting a lot out of watching a whole lot of nothing.Once they do escape, though, things pick up. The focus quickly shifts from a struggle for survival to a struggle to understand. Ma's parents, played by Joan Allen and William H. Macy, have different reactions to the return of their daughter and the arrival of their new (to them) grandson. In the five years since Ma's abduction, her parents have separated; her dad lives on the other side of the country now, and her mom lives with her friend Leo (Tom McCamus). With Ma's return, there's a lot of media hype, and lawyers, atop a potent array of stress factors. Escaping may have been the easy part.The acting is uniformly terrific. Larson's work is powerful, evocative, and heart-wrenching, and it's definitely award worthy. Allen and Macy also excel with perhaps the best work in their respective careers, and that's saying something. Young Tremblay is also very good – as is his character, a plucky, long-haired cherub who's more at home in Room than in the outside world (and with good reason).But the acting cannot overcome what's basically a very turgid script. Room is punchless at its core, and it would be a total waste if it weren't for the Herculean efforts of its talented cast. When there is no action, I look for meaning. When there is no meaning or action, I look for the exit. Room suffers from spending too much time contemplating things and not enough time doing them – or at least discussing them. Forget the action, I wouldn't have minded seeing more reaction. The first half of the movie could have been subtitled ""A Series of Plodding Events."" The second half goes a long way toward saving the first, thanks in part to additional characters and a fresh setting, but it's not enough to save the entire movie."
"The concept was a good one to take on as there have been a number of high profile abduction cases over the past twenty years or so. But I wasn't totally convinced with the script on this one.It was a good effort in showing the psychological problems and scars that the victims are left with. For me, the best part of the movie was the last 15 minutes - they were the most realistic. And the final narration by the young lad was well written - but a five year old wouldn't be that eloquent. The first half of the story based in the room didn't really work well in my estimation.Despite that, all the major players did a fine job, although I wouldn't say Oscar worthy. I wouldn't recommend people to go the movie theater to see this one - you can wait till it comes round on streaming or a movie channel - or Red Box."
"The movie has its moving moments, especially the emblematic one with the kid staring in awe at the newly discovered world, but that's about it. The story is overly unrealistic and both the psychological drama and the physical misery lack depth.17-year-old girl is kidnapped with the lure that some sick dog needs her attention. This is followed by 7 years of imprisonment in a backyard shed (the so-called ""Room"") and regular raping, which – in the second year – produces a child. The mother accepts the fruit of the relationship (named Jack) without reservations and from that moment on her only goal is to keep it safe. A goal in which she succeeds with flying colors. And so, no matter his complete isolation, the misery of his existence, and the fact that he is a constant, although unconscious, witness of his mother's abuse, at 5 Jack is both mentally and physically healthy, even happy child, he has smooth skin and complex reactions and the only sign of his unusual circumstances is his long hair...I didn't even have to use irony – the whole thing is flat enough on its own. Actually, I see it as an insult to anyone who have lived through ""the Room trauma"" – be it real, or more metaphoric. It sets ridiculous standards for the victims while what they truly need is understanding and compassion. But yeah, let's say that mother's love conquers it all and clap our hands."
"I was curious about this film due to many reviews and comments about Brie Larson's performance as well as its Oscars nominations. But I was very disappointed. The film left me indifferent. There was no connection to ""Ma"". I expected a genius acting by young actress judging by the hype, but it was average... Of course, it is difficult to act if one did not actually live it through and it is quite understandable.The only performance that is worth of nominations, from my point of view, is the one of a little boy. So, all in all it is very puzzling why this film and Brie Larson was even considered for Oscars or any other awards.."
"There it is the first movie of the award season which I did not think much of. Don't get me wrong it's a decent but thoroughly average film. The movie starts out promisingly and does a couple of things right, makes no mistakes but does nothing special or extraordinary with the situation. I gave the movie the benefit of the doubt and was hoping the psychological aspects of the film would step up in the second half but it didn't do so, the second half completely changes the situation for worse, there are new problems to deal with and the movie goes about them in it's usual half committed way which was prevalent in first half. The acting is definitely the strong suit of the film, Brie Larson is amazing and I would be OK with her winning the Oscar, though I didn't think much of the film I thought she was great. The kid played by Jacob Tremblay showed amazing depth and variety for a young child. The weakness of the film is direction, it does not capitalizes on it's setting, it has no great scenes and does not visually grab you at anytime (I am not reading a book I am watching a movie), also sometimes Brie Larson's character is quite inconsistent and unrealistic sometimes, she shows very few signs of PTSD, it sometimes feels she was trapped in Room for weeks not seven years, not her fault though, another misstep by the director, along with not capitalizing that Jack maybe better off without Joy (it touches so less on the REAL issues it's infuriating)."
"Sometimes there are these special movies - high ratings, lots of ppl loving them and you just wonder - is this the same movie Iam watching ppl are talking about!? I was just well bored, almost bored to a brain-killing stupor. The young kid played his role not bad but if I compare him with the little girl from the movie Hidden (I know, I know, different genres but at least the location/space/set for acting is comparable)- he's just okay. The one thing I was the whole time wondering - why the woman didn't just kill the guy in his sleep. Well I heard about Stockholm-Syndrome, but the woman didn't behave imo like a person with that ""kind of state"" would, but Iam no specialist here. Well, so many ppl praising and liking that movie so tbh they can't be all wrong - so just try that movie and see what kind of movie Room is for you. Btw - one very weak point of the movie is for me that I didn't attach to the mother and his son at all - I watched that movie with no sympathy nor dislike for them. Well, I rated it 1 because of all the legions of 10s, my ""real"" vote is a 4 but no more.I re-watched the movie and I must say I even do like it less, if it's possible. I realised why I don't like this movie at all: Room tells us the typical Love-Conquers-It-All-Narration but if u have ever known/met a person or worked with a person who was sexually or otherwise traumatically assaulted you know that just love doesn't heal everything. Lots of ppl just never really leave behind the trauma, the trauma is a big part of their life. So this movie is kinda Disney-life and has not much to do with real life. Room is the typical sugar-coated version (and the book also if it has the same conclusion) of a Love-Conquers-It-All-script - it happens in real life yes, but this kind of story is told countless times before on screen and in real life rare. Many real good stories hurt reading, but Hollywood gives you 9 times out of 10 cotton-candy at the end. So does Room. Btw - the boy almost shows no sign of disturbance in his behavior whatsoever. If u see pictures (or meet them in real life) of e.g. war-traumatized kids you understand how dumb this is. If I compare this movie to The Lovely Bones with Saoirse Ronan, Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz u also see that the actors are just mediocre. And whereas The Lovely Bones is really heartbreaking and got suspense and is told poetically superb, Room has nothing of it to offer. Or watch Chained with Vincent D'Onofrio as a sick, emotionally dead serial killer. To watch D'Onofrio's superb play was shocking good. And the relationship between Rabbit (Eamon Farren) and his captor Bob (D'Onofrio) beats everything Room provides easy. Chained is shocking good. Room is shocking naive and boring."
"I was close to turning the film off after just 15 minutes. It was just a whining boy and a lifeless mother arguing with each other. It didn't get remotely interesting until they tried to escape the room. There was no depth, and I also found it really difficult to understand what the boy was saying half the time (though he was a very good actor). I was looking forward to the film ending, but stuck with it as a friend had recommended it. Nothing really happened after they got out, the escape really was the only interesting part. I felt no emotion for the characters and was unmoved and bored throughout."
"Joy Newsome (Brie Larson) and her son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) live in a small room in a shed without windows and with only a skylight on the roof. When Joy has encounters with a man, Jack locks himself in a closet. When Jack is five years old, Joy tells him that she lived with her parents in a comfortable house and a man called Old Nick lured and kidnapped her seven years ago. Joy plots a scheme to let Jack flee from the room and call the police. When they are rescued, they move to the house of Joy's mother and they have to begin the adaptation to the routine of a normal life. But is it not easy.""Room"" is a sensitive and delicate film with a dramatic and realistic story of woman and child abuse and the effects in the aftermath. The screenplay is very well written increasing tension without the use of cheap means such as graphic violence, sex and gore but only subtle dialogues. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay have awesome performances, showing also fantastic chemistry, and with magnificent supporting cast including names such as Joan Allen and William H. Macy. In the end, ""Room"" is an unforgettable and unique film that touches the viewer's heart. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""O Quarto de Jack"" (""The Room of Jack"")"
"Room was tedious from the very beginning. And then it got more tedious. And then it kept on going. And though I waited for something to happen, it didn't. Then something did happen, and I thought, ""Oh, joy. It's finally over."" But alas, it wasn't over. It kept going. And going. And going.Though I had one or two moments where I thought it was cute or interesting, that's not enough to fill out a 2-hour movie. The kid was annoying, the mom was forgettable, the circumstances held no true sense of danger or tension, the aftermath was boring and trite. It might've worked as a 15-minute short film, but good lord, after sitting through it, I felt as though *I* had been trapped in a tiny room for 7 years.I honestly don't understand what people are seeing in this film. There is truly nothing of worth there. Avoid, unless you enjoy things like waiting in line for hours or going over your taxes."
"It's too long and it gets very very boring some times. There are a lot o movies which exploit much better this idea In the beginning of the movie there is not even a clue what is going on but i guess this is a movie trick used by the director.It's not about the fact that they have not escaped in those years. It's about the fact that the movie,after they escape shows a very little preoccupation for the true situation of the characters,of the inside fight. At least it is a better candidate for the Oscar prize, but it is not a movie which deserves a position in top 250 or to be nominated for Oscars. It is good when you put it besides the big short,spotlight,the revenant,bridge of spies, but come on... I hope Mad max will have a serious chance for winning the prize"
"It opens badly, but this is deceptive. If you watch carefully, are very, very patient, look at what's actually there, and give it three minutes-----it gets worse. But wait. This too is unfair. Are you actually seeing what's in front of your eyes? Are you sure? The film demands that you give it at least another ten minutes, and you do. And as soon as you do, it gets worse. After that it gets worse, and then worse, and worse, and worse. And it's only just begun. The setting hasn't even left the room. Then it does. Finally. Surprise! A goodly portion of the film, in fact, at least 30 percent, takes place outside the room. I have no idea why. To show that the outside world is just as claustrophobic? That would've been a good point, but the story doesn't allow it! The writer is adrift. The shift of scenery doesn't help. It makes Room even worse - and it gets worse yet, and even worse than that, despite the brief, welcome, charitable appearance of two superbly talented actors (William H. Macy and Joan Allen) who can actually act, whether they have a character to play or not. Acting, in fact, is not an issue in the movie. To be fair, the child star of the film, Jacob Tremblay (made deliberately genderless as only a 5-year-old could be) gives as execrable a performance as any adult ever has, and deserves a lot of credit for it. If the director intended it that way, he probably either has no children, or doesn't know or like any. It's not totally Tremblay's fault: he obviously found it impossible to believe in the story, as did the writer, director, actors and producers who concocted this infinitely boring, one-dimensional, unfelt drama. Here and there throughout the story, that sickly, treacly piano that has invaded the soundtrack of hundreds of anemic films like a skin rash makes an appearance. To top it off, Room is made with the highest of production values. They are the only values visible, and may lift the movie to the heights of Trumpian emptiness. Americans love nothing better in their movies: production values are the new family values. The overall impression is of a movie, clunkily directed by Lenny Abrahamson, written by someone (Emma Donoghue) whose entire experience of life must have been acquired in a room, probably a classroom, possibly a cloakroom, a writer unashamed to display her bad handwriting, and constitutionally unable or unwilling to share with the public how little she knows or cares about the world she inhabits. A lot has been written about the hell the cinematographers went through to make parts of this movie, jamming their equipment into a tiny cramped space for countless hours. It doesn't show, and what does is not interesting. If they'd shown us the hell, and not the Room they made of it, I'd have had a lot less to say but would've left with more than a craving for a quick burger on my mind."
"This movie has appeal, mainly to women and feminine types, based only on emotion.The strength and devotion of the mother toward her child is well portrayed, however, and the boy does a great job of acting like a spoiled and over-protected child. The mother's love in spoiling the boy, given the terrible circumstances, is quite loving and appropriate though.The movie is boring as would be living in a small room for 5 years without ever going out. That is the essence of this film.Naturally the critics, and those with more emotion than intellect, are gushing over it.Watch it and find out if I am wrong."
"I do not understand how this would be an Academy Award nominated movie for best picture. This could have been a Lifetime movie of the week. In fact, Lifetime did a more interesting version of the story recently. The lead performances are forgettable. At no point in watching these characters did I feel like I was watching a special performance. The mother's performance was muted. There was no emotion in her. I felt the like the son was cookie-cut out of the ""Michelle"" from ""Full House"" role. We are supposed to think to ourselves, ""Oh isn't he cute as a button,"" ""doesn't he say the funniest things you ever heard"" and ""isn't he so aware of his situation and who he is."" Suspense never builds. The movie ultimately is long and boring. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone."
"Within the first 10 minutes of this film, I was curious as to where the writer was going to take the story. Do the mother and son break out? Do they just accept their fate and live there for eternity? Does one of them die? Well, the writers did a great job of surprising me as it seems as if they have never heard of the three act structure.The production value, I digress, was very well done. Good direction, excellent performances, cinematography, etc. For a small budget, it was well done. That's about all I have to say I liked about this film.Back to the story... I'm not going to spoil it here, but as I was saying before the film doesn't follow a three act structure at all. Some films can get away with this, namely some cheesy 80's comedies, but these are comedies, not dramas.In room, there's no call to action, journey to overcome a goal, obstacles in the way of that goal, point of no return, etc. There are subplots that have their own beats, but not a main story.There is sort of a climax at one part. It happens literally half way through the movie, and then the rest of the movie is the resolution, for a whole hour in which you'll be checking the time hoping to god the movie will be over soon. If you have ever thought at the end of a movie, once a character has overcome their weaknesses and achieved their goals, what happens after the film fades to black? The character ought to go on with life, where he or she will face more challenges to come. This film almost seems like it has a fourth act that merely explores this idea. It delves way too far into the aftermath of the events that happen only an hour into the film.There is also a slush of subplots that don't know where they want to weave themselves into the story as they aimlessly fly throughout the film. Here's the beef to my arguments (SPOILERS):First, as I've mentioned before, the story is horribly structured. It starts with about 40 minutes of repetitive introduction, followed by a 20 minute long second act in which they break out, and an hour long resolution in which Jack and his mother deal with the real world.Some may say that it does follow the three act structure and that I'm just missing the real story, which is Jack growing into a world outside of Room. Well here's the problem; if The introduction had included the escape, and then the second act focused on Jack struggling to fit into the regular world until he overcomes his fears, then I'd say it's appropriate to say the story is focused on a boy being exposed to a world he's never seen before. This isn't the case however, as Jack isn't exposed to the real world until the second half of the movie, and this story line is barely glossed over in my opinion.In this movie it seems you have three plots: -Ma's growth and struggle as a kidnapped mother -Jack's coming of age into the world outside of room -The escape from Room.The film tries to put all of these plots into one piece, not focusing on one in particular, which failed to engage me in the story at all. There are also plenty of loose ends and unexplored characters that I could go into, but I'd rather not.Overall, this film reminds me of Prisoners and Sicario. It's a story that has potential, but seems like a first draft of a script. There are too many subplots and not a core story that it focuses on, nor is there a proper three act structure to draw the audience in. The performances and production value is great, but other than that, I thought it was a waste of my time."
"Based on a best selling novel, ""Room"" chronicles the story of a lady and her son held captive by a kidnapper, who actually is his biological father, in a shed comprising merely a 10 X 10 room. For the boy, the room is the only world he has known. The only medium he can see outside is the skylight in the room. The story may sound a nerdy fiction; but the film focuses much on the psychological aspects and discovers the story of desolation and motherhood which comes vividly alive on the screen. There are few scenes in which the boy and the mother have screamed to each other which could have been avoided alas they were like the scenes demanding the Oscars. Nevertheless, the film won an Oscar for the best performance by an actress. The film avoids big star cast or sets; but still the film is rich in emotions, performances, and beauty. The film just beautifully portrays the perspective of a five year old boy who doesn't know the world for real except for what his mother has told him or what he has seen in the TV screen. The emotional attachment portrayed between the two is awesome. Brie Larson's performance doesn't yet equal the winning Oscar performances from Julia Roberts or Hilary Swank, but still she appears stunning and well portrays a petrified lady held captive for six years. Few sequences are pretty familiar, but there are certain moments in the film for which you are drawn to it.Rating: 3 stars out of 4"
"Very slow, disappointing and over rated! Judging by the reviews I though it would be a good film. Stop lying people..."
"Room -A gross irresponsibility of the writer of this film, along with a supporting production crew, and cast. The story glamorizes the process of being held hostage, using a young women and her child. I am afraid why a story teller would choose such a topic, and why would he be so consumed as to make a message of this to the general population. Although it may seem cute at first seeing how a boy senses the room, and world around him; I am left with the taste that it only desensitizes others. This is not a story we should expose ourselves to like this, as a human race we might be tempted to play it down if it happens to others in real life, or make it seem to others it is not so bad to commit such an act to others.There is a responsibility here when you interact with the public. I realize art is based on trying to work through what happens to you or what you have experienced, the art part being you are trying to get others to feel and communicate with you and what you are experiencing. But if that be the case here, then a more appropriate form of art in the direction of it should have been a movie portraying the horror of being held captive, and better yet maybe even realize this is too hard a topic not just for the writer to articulate but also too hard for the general public to consume. I give this film a rating of zero, and suggest this film maker and crew take a different occupation to make money. I don't want to be a part of any of it anymore. And yes, there are many movies which could be labeled as I did with this one, but someone should write an honest review, a responsible review."
"Room is one of those movies that people read rave reviews about and then adopt it. Having just watched a UK preview screening I wanted to let you know what kind of a movie it really is.For starters it is really...well...cold. The director has tried a silent approach to take out the emotion and concentrate on the subject matter but has gone too far and left it a bland and dim affair. I was expecting a lot more from the confined direction but not once did I get feeling of claustrophobia. Every character was also very one dimensional and stereotypical.Too many issues all going at once but none of them were dealt with properly. It's not a bad movie but I think the bland direction and lack of narrative let it down...I would imagine the book would be far,far superior. Still worth a trip to the cinema because I love movies on the big screen...where they should be...and it will not show well on T,V or DVD.One of those movies that try to make you think but come across as somewhat pretentious and believes it's own hype..will not win a single nomination...let alone an award."
"I hope the book is better than the movie....SPILOERS ALERT: 1= This story is told n the kids POV at first glance it might not be the best idea, because really this story is all about the mother decent (more on that later) but somehow it works out.2= The camera is sort of shaky and gritty I guess it fits at first for the beginning while they are still held captive in the room. Not only to make you feel like you're in the movie but also to force you to feel what both of them are going through and to also to sit the mood I guess.3=I simply don't get it if the captive mother (Joy) has a knife why wouldn't she just simply use it to force their way out. And why would the captor give his captive victim a knife in the first place, spectrally when clearly she hasn't yet lost all hope? Huh?! No not just a knife but why not just grab an thing to use as a weapon. Even before when she got pregnant, sure she tried once before but why wouldn't she just try again? Again huh? 4= There is a great Mother/Son sit up unfortunately they missed that up, yes at first in the beginning they did have a great relationship but for most of the time they mainly just yell and scream at each other. In addition I just don't get the kid's (Jake's) seemingly erratic mood swings. OK I get it he's frighten in beginning because all he knows is the Room, and now all of sudden his mother is telling him about life outside the Room, but even after when he and his mother were rescued he still remained bratty and having all of these erratic mood swings. I simply just don't get that.5= The night scenes are simply just way too dark to see anything now, I'm not sure if that was the attent or what, but in either case for that simply just cheapens the movie. And this is coming from someone that just sits in his dark room from time to time with little to no light being lighting the room from an outside source. And even that I could still see shapes of objects, but with this movie I don't know what was going even with sound.6= There is a poor sit up of the Kidnapper (old Nick), somehow feel his character just wasn't fleshed out enough.7= I feel the second attempt at escape wasn't will planned out enough, and what I mean by that is that they were so busy planning out the main plain they forgot t plain out the Plain 'B'.8= I just don't have any emonal or any kind of connection towards or against anyone in the film, which is too bad because I love Mother/Child Relationships. And speaking of I'm simply not sure if anyone in this movie is truly likable.9= At times during the movies I feel that it's simply too long. I often find myself thinking during the movie 'This movie is simply too long it should only be a 90min movie. And not a 2hr movie.' 10= However I do feel that there is a lot of plot holes in the movie: What happen to Old Nick. Did the dog ate him? Is Jake home schooled or does go to public school? Etc... but I guess those are just simply 'minor' plot holes.11= The good points: is that I do like almost everything that happens in the Room before the escape. Also I do like the music that went along with the escape. In addition I do also like the descent into depression of Joy (Mother) after when she was rescued. Finally, finally only at the end where the Mother comes back from what we can assume 'getting help' just after trying to kill herself some time after being rescued. They finally, finally show this excellent Mother/Son relationship in some kind of mini montage. All leading up to this neat and interesting ending (which I will not ruin for you).CP: I'm not sure the ending itself is enough to redeem it , but however I am wandering should I have waited to buy?"
"Couldn't get past the first 40 min of depressing material. This is just too much for me. Why is the story of a captive and her child interesting? It is not. Shows the detailed life of a captive person. I am sure there is something uplifting at some point but I am just not interested. This is current, has happened, etc. I just don't need to watch the detail of it including the emotional pain etc. This is not a story that needs to be told it is a story that we need to prevent in the real world. It is not entertaining, just exceptionally depressing. The possibility of harm to the child by the captor is in no way exciting or interesting to me. I could also watch a day in the life of a prisoner who is raped in the cell but why? Is that somehow interesting? Not to me."
"I've just returned from the pictures after watching this film. Great performance from the young boy Jack, but doesn't carry the film.Too many unanswered questions and holes in the plot lines. The worst was:-three slows and a stop, and robocopette leads them directly to the shed??? really??? I left the pictures when they found the dog toy behind the settee. probably not a great admission for a reviewer, but it had seemed to have slipped back into maudlin and lethargy. maybe I missed the best bits, but did I really have to get into a state of boredom before I could appreciate it? just because Jacks' like was full of tedium and repetition, doesn't mean the point has to be hammered home so effectively. there is nothing wrong with slow moving films as long as it is effective.films where you wonder whats around the corner rather than hope.I have only left a film once before. Hostel.Ankles. I couldn't watch anymore, and for completely differing reasons, and neither could I tonight."
"I'm compelled to write this review because of the 8 score, which is why I watched it. I found it on an all-time list of best films, higher than some timeless masterpieces, and checked with IMDb. Has cinema really become so bad that this is considered a highlight? The synopsis hinted that the film would address re-assimilation issues which could have been interesting. But wasn't. They weren't even plausible, which didn't occur to me at the time because I was drifting off. A very young boy, who has spent his whole life in a shed and is suddenly thrown into suburban USA, behaves no more traumatised than a shy child meeting somebody for the first time. And as for the escape plan...Don't be fooled, this are no deep insights, no personality developments, and no twists. There is no drama, no laughs, no tension and very little emotion. The tone of the film is just so lifeless. Film is supposed to be an art form. Art requires love and passion from the people creating it. There are a couple of genuinely moving moments, so I raised the score to a 3, but they stand out simply because the rest of the film is so dull. It seems that the reality TV fad has passed onto fiction. I recall the early Big Brother series and people watching while celebrities lay snoring in bed. This is the fictional equivalent."
"I am giving 'Room' 10 stars, this film is truly amazing and a touching presentation of Emma Donoghue's book 'Room'. They have really stuck to the book which is what I love about this adaptation, there are just so many words to describe this film it is just so hard to put them all together in one review because Room is spectacular and heart wrenching. This film really gives you a point of view from the other side of the story, it is not all about the thriller aspects of how 'Ma' (Brie Larson) has been held captive for years by a horrible man she refers to as 'Old Nick' who in retrospect is a kidnapper and an atrocious man. It looks at the characters sides of the story especially her son Jack who she has whilst captive in Room. He looks at life from a completely different view to his Ma and everybody else in the world that does not exist in Jack's mind. To Jack it is just him and his Ma, he sees no negativity in their situation which is truly beautiful. Not only do I love how they have shown a different perspective of life in Room they have shown the reality of life outside of Room and how the characters cope and react differently, it is unforgettable and truly moving. I just could not fault this remarkable masterpiece.I absolutely adore how this is so carefully written, it is a sensitive subject that is rarely spoken about and I have never looked at these types of stories from the victim's point of view. It is heart breaking to sit and watch this film but at the same time it gives you an insight of the unfortunate people in the world who have to live like this and sometimes their stories do not turn out as well as Ma and Jack's stories, which is a really painful subject and will always have an effect on the world. I would definitely recommend this film to anybody; no matter what genre you are interested in you just have to see this film. It is so brilliant that I would not even know what genre to class it as, there are so many special moments in the film that just cannot be created again they are incredibly unique and the actors play these characters perfectly you just could not have picked actors more perfect then the ones that brought these characters to life.I was left laughing, crying and just smiling throughout all the different memorable scenes in Room. There was not a single moment that I was disinterested; I was left moved and unable to take my eyes of the screen, I really did not want this film to end. But they have made a fantastic adaptation of Room that just cannot be faulted and will be a forever classic that will never grow old. The uniqueness of this film is outstanding and just will not be able to be duplicated."
"Well, this was one of the most critically acclaimed movies of last year. Everyone loved and talked about the performances. When I first saw it, I thought it was good, but after another watch, it doesn't hold up as much. Let me make this clear, I don't think its bad, it just isn't as effective on a second (and most likely third) viewing, and Im a person who believes a great movie can hold up on multiple viewings. Anyways lets get started.Ill start off with the positives. The performances were pretty great. Brie Larson, I can't say anything new about her since everyone has already said how great she was, and I can't disagree with that. Jacob Tremblay was surprisingly good. I say surprisingly since most child actors are known for being terrible, but he was great. Even the actors who weren't in it for very long, like William H Macy, were great. So all around great acting. The script did have its moments, it wasn't amazing, but not bad. I think its good for a first time a writing a screenplay. It had some heavy handed moments, but some subtler moments. My biggest problem is that some of the characters were somewhat cliché, but thats really it. Now for the negatives. My biggest problem is that the first third of the movie, the part that takes place in Room, drags on, a lot. It didn't bother me as much on my first watch, but on a second watch it feels like it goes on forever. I know some people found this part very emotional, but I just couldn't get into it. I started to see some of the problems on the second watch, which aren't really major problems, but really bugged me. For instance, the cinematography is kinda bad (which bugs me since i'm a cinematography buff). There were sometimes when the characters got a bit hard to feel for after the first third, I just didn't get invested anymore. Luckily after the first third is over, it does pick up a lot more and gets a lot more interesting, but the other part was just unbearable.So in conclusion, Room isn't bad, its just one of those movies that declines on repeated watch.Final Score: 6/10"
"Watching ""Room"" is like taking in a film on the Lifetime channel with an A-list cast and a big budget. Like the novel that was the basis for the film, there is a two-part melodramatic structure to the narrative.Melodrama #1 depicts the harrowing captivity of a woman held hostage by her captor for a seven-year period in a dingy, claustrophobic shed in the offender's back yard. Two years into captivity, the woman delivered a baby boy, who is now five years old. The first half of the film plays out like a Harold Pinter drama with the mundane dialogue of the mother and son, plus menacing visits from the captor.The second melodramatic action follows the daring escape of the child, who is successful in alerting the authorities, who free the mother from the shed. The second half of the film is the more engaging because it introduces the family members and seeks to portray the recovery of the traumatized mother and child. Unfortunately, there are too many plot holes in this intense drama, the most glaring of which is the insensitivity of the grandfather character, as played by W. H. Macy.The screenplay was adapted by Emma Donoghue from her novel, and her strong suit is in storytelling, not character motivation. At one of the crucial junctures of the film, when the mother needed support from the family, the grandfather refused to even look at the boy.In the novel, it is made clear that the father is tormented by the idea that the grandson would have the same face as the perpetrator who abducted and raped his daughter. But in the film, the little boy's face is a dead ringer for the mother--not the father. The motivation was not spelled out in the screenplay, and the film's director was completely oblivious of the unmotivated action of the grandfather. In the DVD's commentary track, the director spoke of deleting a scene where the grandfather peeks into the bedroom of the little boy, but still cannot bring himself to look at the child. By restoring that scene, the motivation for Macy's character would still be confusing to the audience.At the premiere of the film at the Landmark Theatre on West Pico in Los Angeles, there was an artistic installation of the 11' X 11' room that was recreated on the site. Such a display indicates the shortcomings of this film in the superficial treatment of a serious topic. This film should have offered a strong social commentary about predators like the one who abducted the young woman. Shouldn't the television reporter be investigating the perpetrator, instead of grilling the young woman, as we see in the film? The overall effect of the film sadly trivializes a serious subject and turns a topic that should evoke moral outrage into a routine tearjerker."
"'ROOM': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The critically acclaimed dramatic thriller flick; directed by Lenny Abrahamson and written by Emma Donoghue (based on her 2010 novel, of the same name). The film is about a young mother, being held captive in a locked single-room, with her 5-year-old son. The boy has never known life, outside of the room; so his mother creates a complete alternate reality, inside the room for him. It stars Brie Larson and newcomer Jacob Tremblay, as the kidnapped mother and son. It also costars Sean Bridgers, Joan Allen and William H. Macy. The film is predicted to be a likely Oscar contender, come awards time, and it's received almost unanimously positive reviews, from critics. I liked it.Jack (Tremblay) is five-years-old, and he's been locked in a single- room, with his mother Joy (Larson), all of his life. He's never seen the world, outside of the room, and his mother has taught him 'room' is all there is. We later learn that Joy was kidnapped when she was 17, and her captor impregnated her, with Jack, five-years earlier. As Joy becomes even more desperate, to escape, she finally enlists Jack's help, in a dangerous plan. The film is really dark and depressing, but there's also a slight bit of hope (in the darkness). Larson is fantastic in the lead, and Tremblay is also amazing (especially for an actor so young). The movie is very moving, intense and heartbreaking; it's beautifully directed by Abrahamson, and brilliantly written by Donoghue. The film is basically everything you'd expect from a critical darling 'Oscar hopeful'. It's pretty hard to watch though, at times, but it's worth it.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/MylbbGyo_MU"
"Typically you expect dramatic productions to have some sort of resolution, a satisfying denouement or if nothing else at least some intriguing moments with characters, dialogue and scenery that capture the imagination.Room offers none of that, relying wholly on two main conceits to carry the entire weight of the story. Beyond the first act this film is interminably dull and by the end of it I found myself thinking ""what the f**k was that it"".While it avoids being offensively bad, Room is still not an enjoyable watch. Best avoided."
"I came to this movie after watching Captain Marvel, in which Brie Larson played a boring role, and I wondered what made her famous.
Then I really got amazed and deeply struck by her (and her little child's) exquisite performance. I was moved to tears by this movie which depicted those touching scenes of a horrible story, where the mom and her boy depend on each other and take care of each other.
The movie remind me of how beautiful our world is and what make us human. Definitely one of the best movies I've ever watched."
"Lenny Abrahamson directed one of the best hidden gems of 2014 in FRANK, a strange little film starring Domhnall Gleeson and Michael Fassbender about an indie band getting an unpleasant taste of mainstream success. It was a dark comedy with some real emotion sown into it. A year later, Abrahamson returns with a new film where he goes straight for the heart with a vengeance in ROOM. This man is one of the best directors I've found for emotional impact, keeping in mind I've seeing nothing else of his work but the two mentioned. But there is no denying the emotional gut punch you get watching ROOM. Based on a source novel from author Emma Donoghue (who also penned the script), it's a disturbing (and eventually uplifting) tale told primarily from the perspective of little Jack (Jacob Tremblay). As the movie begins, Jack is awakening for his fifth birthday in Room, the only world he knows. He was born in Room lived in it all his life with his mom (Brie Larson). He's a relatively happy child who believes Room to encompass the entirety of the world. Except, now that he's five, his mom believes it's time for him to know the truth. Seven years prior, she had been tricked and abducted by the man he knows only as Old Nick, the mysterious visitor who comes at night while Jack's asleep to bring food and supplies. Old Nick locked Jack's mom in the little 11' x 11' garden shed and she's been trapped there ever since. Now that Jack is getting older, his mom wants him to help them escape to freedom.ROOM is divided into two distinct halves: inside Room and outside Room. The first half of the movie is arguably the best material in my opinion. It paints a picture of daily life for Jack and his mom, giving the audience a glimpse into their meager existence. Ma tries to make the best of a bad situation for Jack but there's only so much she can do. Until now, Jack has had zero knowledge of a world beyond the walls. He believes TV shows are from other planets, believes common things like trees and dogs are make-believe, and addresses every item in Room as if it were one of his best friends. While Ma has done her best to keep Jack somewhat normalized and happy, she isn't faring as well. She's been beaten, tortured, and raped. She's been trapped in this room for seven years with only a small skylight in the ceiling giving her a glimpse of the natural sky. There are days when the pressure just gets to be too much; Jack calls them her ""gone days"" when she lies in bed, not moving or speaking a word. It's a nerve-wracking first half to a film and ramps up to the eventual escape planning. Again, the emotional gut punches keep coming as Ma realizes she will likely have to put her son in mortal danger if she ever hopes of getting him out of there with the chance of a normal life. Meanwhile, Jack is confused and scared out of his wits. His mom has turned his entire world upside down with talk of how there is an enormous world outside the four walls and how all those things he believed imaginary are real.The second half of the movie loses a little steam because we don't have the built-in tension that comes with a captive and her son living in a box with an unstable kidnapper, but it delves into life after Room. It shows how Ma and Jack begin to adjust to the real world. To Jack, of course, this is more than his mind can process at first. I mean, the kid has never seen a horizon before and now he's faced with new environments, new experiences, and new people. While Jack does have his own troubles acclimating to the new life, Ma seems to have it worse. She seems all right at the start, relieved to be free and happy to return to normality, but after seven years of that sort of tortuous existence, normal doesn't come easy. Her parents have since divorced and her own mother has an old friend as her new live-in boyfriend. Her father has moved away and returns to reconnect with his long-lost daughter, but he has trouble accepting Jack and hiswellorigins. Brie Larson does a phenomenal job with this material. Ma is a complex, deeply troubled character and Larson positively nails it with a very natural, genuine performance. She deserved every award she brought home for this role. Equal accolades belong to young Jacob Tremblay. In my experiences, the grand majority of child actors turn in stiff, unnatural performances but there are exceptions and Tremblay is top of the list. I believed every moment of his performance in ROOM and it's a real accomplishment for both him and director Abrahamson. ROOM is undoubtedly one of the best movies from 2015 (again, my opinion but I strongly believe so) and it comes with a strong recommendation from me. You'd have to be pretty dead inside for this movie to have not even the slightest emotional effect on you."
"But that title was already taken. Also Room is pretty accurate and hits ""home"" (no pun intended). But while I had no idea what I would get with this (apart from the title and the lead actress I didn't know one piece of information), most will go into this knowing what it's about. The general idea is explained fairly quickly, though the why of the closed space or rather location and the reason for staying might take a while to sink in.If you already know some of the whys because of the trailer or reading the story, don't be afraid though. The movie moves forward and it does not stay stagnant at all. That is true regarding the story, but the characters have some other issues to solve. Talking about solving, you won't get all the answers for this, but this is a pretty good and strong depiction psychologically speaking of what persons go through, without getting into their heads. Great acting and drama make this a great movie ... if you like the genre that is of course."
"Ma: ""You're gonna love it"".Jack: ""What?"".Ma: ""The world"".Room tells the story of a relationship between a mother and son, as she raises him while confined to a 10x10 room and what happens when they finally get out.Since the 2016 Oscars are on Sunday and I've been lacking quite a bit on seeing as many Oscar contenders from last year. Room was one of those movies, as I've heard nothing but great things about it and how truly unique it is (from what I heard). It was a real shame that I had to wait for a while to get a chance to watch this movie, because it's been a very slow month over here in jolly good England. But after finally seeing the movie after that long wait, I can say that the movie was pretty underwhelming, and that's really disappointing saying that.Brie Larson has been sweeping the award season this year, by taking home: The BAFTA, Golden Globe, Critics Choice award and the SAG award, and it's very deserving. Brie Larson delivered a tremendous performance and she was without a doubt the best part of this movie. I'm so happy that Larson is finally getting noticed since everyone pretty much forgot about ""Short Term 12"" and her performance in that film that got very unnoticed. Larson shows off her acting skills in this movie and I know for a fact that she will receive an Oscar on Sunday night. She was truly brilliant in this movie and one of her best performance so far.Lenny Abrahamson (director of the movie) brought us the 2014 film ""Frank"", which I really liked and I couldn't wait to see want he will bring to this movie, and what he brought was somewhat of a mix bag for me. I'm happy for him to get an Oscar nomination, but I didn't find anything that special or groundbreaking when it came to it's directing. Most of it is just copy and past from the book that this movie is based on, so Abrahamson can look on what he's doing. I didn't read the book (and never will) but I've heard a lot of people who did read the book say that the book is better than the movie, and even the author herself said the same thing. The directing isn't anything Oscar worthy, but it's decent directing at best for Abrahamson.The first act of this movie was very strong and it did kept my interest. That's the biggest positive I had for this movie is it's first act.Jacob Tremblay is an unknown star to me and for everyone else, so this is basically he's break out role. I did look up on what Tremblay has been in before and I found out he was in ""The Smurfs 2"" which wasn't that good. But all that aside, I thought he's performance was alright, nothing outstanding, but nothing terrible. He's better than most kids I've seen in recent movies, but I also have seen better ones as well.Now for the problems: The second act wasn't as strong as the first act. The movie did lose me a couple of times as I became disinterest as it went along.The movie did feel like a sugar-coated version of the book and as I said before I haven't even read the book, but for what I heard from other people, the book is more graphic and dark than the movie. I get this question asked a lot when I say the movie sugar-coated from the book, ""Would you rather have graphic scenes of rape from the book"", well if that's what the book is suppose to be, then yeah, and it's not because I want to see someone get raped, but if you what me to give a crap about the characters and their struggle to see how their suffered, then the film makers shouldn't have sugar-coated it. I feel like if this movie was handled by a different director, it would have been a much better movie. The movie is basically telling you that there's violence and rape that happened, but there's nothing really graphic about it. The movie tells you to care about things that it never bothers developing and if you are going to make a movie on a subject like that, and pretend that this horrible thing that happened, again, you shouldn't sugar-coat it. Take ""12 Years a Slave"" as an example: That movie was graphic, brutal, honest and that's what made it an amazing movie, because it took a real life story like slavery that's suppose to make you feel for the character's and makes you look at what their been through and say to yourself ""Wow, that was truly awful"". Now look at Room, we have a single character and the movie is telling you to feel bad for her and what shes been through, but it didn't show any of it, and it's not like it has to be graphic for the sake of it, but it didn't even try to develop it.Overall Room was very overwhelming and kind of bland. I know a lot of people are going to get mad at me for not loving this movie as they do, but that's just my opinion."
"I never write reviews but rarely do my opinions disagree with the IMDb top 250 so greatly so I wanted to explain myself.Room has probably the highest production value of any movie. That being said, it primarily takes place in a shack and inside a house. That being said, it probably cost around 5 million to make. So high marks there. I must mention is has perfect acting. H Macy, Bree, that kid, everyone, congrats. But in my opinion, perfect production value (script, camera, acting, directing, location, art dept, etc) does not mean the movie is perfect.It's how the production value works together as a living entity. For instance, Star Wars has inconsistent production value, yet it is still watched today. That is because the bad and good production value come together and create an entity. A movie.In Room, all the production value does not make a great movie. I leave the movie feeling empty and destroyed. I leave hating the cinema if that is the best cinema has to offer. I digress, the movie needed to be told in a non linear way to make it more tasteful with about half of it being cut and replaced with something else. While I'm sure this is quite tasteful as a book, as a film, I don't want to see a women getting rapped in front of her son 8 times and nether should you.This leads me to conclude that the academy, critics and many IMDb users are sociopaths. Or simply, nitpickers whom only care about production value. The level of this dastardly accusation I have just come up with is proportional to the rate I disagree with critics, IMDb users, academy with a +/- 2 point buffer in regards to our respective ratings of this movie. I give this a 5.4.This means I may be right in this conclusion: Cinema is not safe. But than again, it probably never was."
"We all know how the Academy continually gives out awards and award nominations to the wrong movies, while snubbing movies that are superior in every other way. HOWEVER, the Academy really dropped the ball here.I am a huge movie buff and will pretty much watch anything even if the premise doesn't have mass appeal. This one clearly has less mass appeal, but the critical acclaim drew me in and wasted 1 hour and 20 minutes of my life (I couldn't watch the last 40 minutes and after reading the plot summary on Wikipedia, I was relieved/upset to find out I didn't miss anything.)The character development flat out sucks. I'm all for movies with a slightly ambiguous nature, but you gotta satisfy the viewers somehow by letting them know what's going on and having the movie make sense. Brie Larson is decent in the main role, but her character isn't really explored and there isn't enough depth to her character. Jack (don't know the actor's name) is a basic 5-year old and I've heard a better child-centric voice narration from a Disney movie. The only reason I gave it a 5 and not something lower is because there are a few aspects of the film I liked. *SPOILER ALERT* The scene where they finally escape from the room is engaging, but after that the film drags on as the people who made this film don't have any knack for quality storytelling. *END SPOILER ALERT*Don't waste your time on this movie as it doesn't do justice to a very disturbing subject matter and only leaves you asking one question: Why did I waste 2 hours of my life? Congrats Academy for messing up again. It just really sickens me that great films like Love & Mercy, Straight Outta Compton, Sicario, and The End of the Tour get not nearly the acclaim they deserve by the Academy (Sicario and Straight Outta Compton deserve more nominations) or fail to be recognized by the Academy at all (Love & Mercy, The End of the Tour). The Academy sucks and this film re-confirmed it for me."
"I have been waiting to see this movie for months. I read the book one holiday and found it gripping and haunting. Sadly, the film did not achieve the level of drama that the novel had in abundance. My husband (who has not read the book and knew nothing of the story) was in agreement. So many missed opportunities to look into the minds and emotions of these characters. The acting was fine but far too much of what made the book so fascinating was skimmed over and I'm not sure why..... I was particularly disappointed by the characterisation of 'Old Nick' (mid-cast, I feel, and we see little of his confused and confusing state of mind. Jack's relationship with the objects in the house is skimmed over and the conflicts of the grandparents were simply alluded to rather than properly explored. Perhaps this oversimplification of a complex and gripping story was an attempt to convey what was happening through Jack's eyes? If so, it didn't work for me."
"'Room' is a powerful and tense movie that tells the story of a young boy who has been confined to a small box shed his whole life after his mother was abducted by a man, the boy's father, known only as 'Old Nick' in the movie.The movie centers around their escape and life in the world thereafter. As you would expect, it makes for a tense couple of hours of viewing but the viewer is rewarded in the end. The heartwarming relationship between mother and son is what makes this movie.'Room' is a gripping movie that will take you on a roller-coaster of emotions, but it's well worth the ride."
"Lenny Abrahamson directs Emma Donoghue's screenplay and novel brilliantly. An exploration of the senses. After being abducted, raped and imprisoned in a small windowless shed, a young woman (Brie Larson) gives birth and raises her son, Jack (Jacob Tremblay), in that same confined space. Ma is a dedicated mother, nurturing her son with love and warmth with his happiness and safety top priority. After five years or telling stories, playing games and singing songs; Jack's Ma begins planning their escape.Larson and Tremblay turn in performances that are sentimentally elegant. Rounding out the cast: Sean Bridgers, Sandy McMaster, Joan Allen, Justin Mader, Matt Gordon and William H. Macy."
"I don't know if it was what I was smoking when I watched this, but I never want to sit through it again. I'm no seasoned movie critic, but I've got something to say. I immediately picked up on Brie's painfully unconvincing performance. The next thing I noticed was the terrible, soulless child actor who managed to be irritating and unlikable throughout. It felt as if the mother character was supposed to exhibit the pain and torment of both a captive prisoner and the mother from The Babadook, in which both were pulled off horribly. Looking up the movie brings up that its genre is Drama/Thriller, but I honestly could not pick up what this movie was supposed to make me feel. The man holding them captive is not intimidating whatsoever, he poses no threat and does not make me feel scared when the mother and son start taking risks. The tone changes constantly when your child actor cannot emote, stop screaming, or repeating themselves. Compared to decent child actors, the choice here doesn't feel intentional, as if the kid was mentally damaged from living in a shed. It felt like a lazy choice and I didn't care in the end if he survived honestly. The movie did not make me feel any sympathy for him. The kid totally breaks the pacing multiple times, ruining any form of suspense or thrill. He will say something stupid and unrelated, yell, etc. while another character is trying their best to perform. I know he is supposed to be an irritating kid, but I can't help but feel like he could've been done better. His monotone voiceovers come off as cheesy and uninspired, too. Total bore.The worst part? Nothing happens. It's damn boring. Events just kind of happen one after the other - I can barely tell when each act starts and the resolution just felt too.. easy? Simply getting out a-okay from the shed after having to vomit on her son didn't feel like a nice payoff. And the movie just keeps going - never ends. I hope I never have to sit through this again thank you Hanni for making watch this boring, loud, overrated movie. I see a gold film in here, but as of now I cannot fathom how this got any awards. The whole thing felt almost laughably bad if it wasn't for the lack of literally anything happening at all."
"Room is a simple story that will hit you hard. Brie Larson plays a young woman (Ma) who was abducted and has been held captive in 'Room' for 7 years, where she has subsequently given birth to her son Jack. Jack has never been out of Room and knows nothing else. We see how they cope in day to day life in Room, as the captor brings them basic rations every day. Throughout the film it is left to our imagination as to where exactly they are and what is the reason why. Jack believes that the outside world is non existent and anything he sees on TV is not real. Jack is key to their escape so Ma has to explain the situation very carefully to him in order for him to grasp that the outside world is indeed real. The pacing of the film is very good, we pretty much have two halves: the first half starts straight away with the pair in Room, we see them go through many different emotions in their fight for survival. Then they plan the escape (which if you have seen any trailer for the film you will know that they eventually escape anyway so it's not a spoiler). The second half of the film is about both of them adjusting to the outside world. Ma going back to family life and facing struggles as her father can't even look at Jack. Thankfully her mum and mum's boyfriend are much more supportive and really help Jack along the way. The acting is terrific throughout the film which gave it a lot of realism. I do wish that the film had perhaps been a bit more detailed, we could've had another 20-30 minutes which could've explained briefly how the captor took Ma, what exactly happened to him at the end and how he was caught, a few bits of news/interviews detailing the fact that she was missing, search parties for her, was anyone ever suspicious of him etc. And also a bit more of Ma and Jack as he was younger just to get a sense of even more struggle they went through and then perhaps a little segment at the end of him growing up in the world. All in all though it is certainly my favourite film of the Oscar nominees for best picture this year. 9/10 and highly recommended to all."
"The first hour of this film is as taut and compelling as any psychological thriller, you're really in it with the mother and son and rooting for them to get out. The writing, direction, and production design are top notch.Once the mother and soon do escape, the filmmakers don't seem to know what to do with them, and the quality of everything to do with the second half is a mediocre-at-best, straight to cable melodrama. That quality includes the acting, directing, writing, set design (aside from he subtle ""bars"" in the home set.This material seems better suited for a TV drama or serial.Granted, the lead performances are spectacular."
"The movie has some issues with pacing (way too slow for me), annoying hand-held camera and lack of good score that is ESSENTIAL to carry a movie that is slow paced and takes place in a single room.The kid is easily the best part in this movie. He is very good in his role and could have been nominated for a high-ranked award. I also liked Tom McCamus. Very nice low-key role. I thought I knew him from somewhere (and not just because he looks like Lou Reed) - He was in POSSIBLE WORLDS (great movie), got pretty old since then.The movie is slow and simple. I expected a much smarter plot. The lead actress is OK, but I don't think it's Oscar material."
"First off I'll say it's best if you go into this movie fresh with as little known as possible, that way you will have at least that going in.So you're trapped in a shed by a man who kidnaps you and rapes you practically every day for seven years. In this shed there is a door which is locked by a combination keypad lock, you have been provided with sheets, some clothes, water, food, I think there is a glass or two, matches, an oven/heater/microwave, and there is a skylight in the top of the shed. The guy comes in to have sex with you and he eats the food you cook for him and he sleeps in bed with you(not sex, actual sleep). After a while you bear a child Now I'm pretty sure quite a bit of you reading this would have come up with quite a bit of plans within five minutes or at least a number of complicated plans within a span of a week, or at the very least hatched a convincing plan when your son was born and of a decent age to run. The woman in the movie however comes up with two really bad plans, one of which surprisingly works. Well actually her first plan consisted of hitting him that one time with a really heavy thing, him damaging her wrist..somehow and she not trying anything after that from what I can recall. I am still surprised that the end plan actually worked considering how asinine it was, didn't seem very logical and didn't line up with how a captor of this woman would behave.Ignoring all that though, I thought it was a movie about the psychology of victim and kidnapper/captor/rapist, or the mom and her son within the confines of this shed and how they cope with being held against their will and the child somehow not knowing this. Nope. I said okay then fine, maybe it's about the plan and coming up and following through with a plan that sets them both free and- nope. Then when the escape takes place I thought it was then going to be about the kid escaping from the guy and finding help. Nope, he finds it within a minute of jumping out the truck. Okay then I thought, well the guy who 'saved' the kid didn't bother to take a photo of the truck or even bother to note the license plate so I thought it would be a manhunt for the guy and a race to get to the mom before the kidnapper-No, no, nope, they find her within like five minutes. She's okay. Then maybe how about she and her son living with the constant threat and presence of the one who kidnapped her still on the lamb, free to swoop in and- no, they arrest him in some aside news report. Well fine then, no action, a quality drama about how this woman adjusts to losing all that time in her life, dealing with how the world is now, getting a job, settling back in, adjusting to men having being raped for seven years(or just adjusting in general after being raped and confined for seven years and having a baby for your rapist), picking up her life and how her son adjusts to all this and being-No. Nothing of the sort really, or kind of. They sort of go for some of those things, then stop short and drop them. She gets depression but it's nothing that significant or rather not shown to be that impactful, just seemed like the sort of depression that I've seen in a number of teenagers. I figured we'd have much more in the form of the son, but no, he's shy and has bad grammar, but it's not really that out of the ordinary for a kid with say aspergers. Late in the movie a random kid(I was actually thinking none existed in this movie world since no one really came over to interact with the kid or mom when they got back but is somewhat understandable) and he got along fine with the other kid kicking a ball. Maybe about the family dynamics, her parents aren't together anymore, maybe then about the family why and how they split apart, how they must adjust to finding their daughter and their son and-no, not really.It just sorts of superficially goes for things and then stops short, it felt like watching a well made Lifetime movie of white middle America drama. I guess it was partially my fault for seeing the numerous ripe dramatic and tense places the film could have gone and then never going there.You don't have to give me action, suspense, terror etc, but you could have given me some solid drama to sink my teeth into, and unfortunately this movie didn't have any of that for me. My wife liked it though, so I guess it's more for the women Lifetime audience mom crowd."
"Now, I don't think it was bad, thought it was ehh , I just wish the filmmaker had done more. Never while in Room did I get the sense of claustrophobia to emphasize just how tiny the area that the characters were in was (which really makes the fact that they actually filmed in that tiny area pretty pointless), or hopelessness, and imprisonment, to highlight the unbelievable amount of time that they've been there; Instead, we are just told this information. In addition, due to not really getting what situation these characters were in, made it really underwhelming when they made their rather fortunate escape; there was no feeling of awe at this, seemingly, new and strange environment (like in Oldboy, The Hurt Locker,and The Descent), and it's clear with the slow-mo, and shots of Jack's (Jacob Tremblay) face that was what they were attempting.Aside from what I'd wish they'd done, there were also some questionable and unfitting music choices throughout, and two scenes: during and immediately following the escape. The two scenes came off as awkward, unrealistic, and contrived; and the acting and characters in these scenes were both bad and annoying.Besides the already mentioned, the acting in this film was good, with Brie Larson being the standout. And though I thought Jacob Tremblay was good, for a kid, I didn't think his performance was amazing or award worthy, like I had heard previous to watching Room. Just because his performance was better than most child performances doesn't mean it's great.I appreciated the way they decided to take the story, and I liked the way Brie's character's struggles were handled, and to be honest, that's it.With all this pessimism, it may be hard to believe that I didn't hate this film, but I didn't; I just thought it was meh. Nothing special, and I won't be seeing it again, though it is watchable."
"When I first saw that a new trailer for a film called 'Room was released online, i had a shiver cast through my spine, dreading that it wasn't a remake, sequel, or re-release of the 2003 monstrosity that was 'The Room'. How relieved I was to find out it was actually about a mother and sons journey of escaping from the single, enclosed room where they were held captive in and then watching the 5 year-old 'Jack' adapt to the huge world we live in.The main structure of the film splits down into 2 parts; When they're inside 'Room' and when they've escaped. I completely felt for Brie Larsons 'Ma' having to raise a child who's only experiences in life have occurred inside 'Room'. Larsons performance was something that added so much emotional depth to her character as she manages to show the psychological damage 'Old Nick' (her kidnapper) has put her through. The 9 year old Jacob Tremblay added a believable performance from such a young actor who at times you really feel sorrow for. Then, when the riveting escape sequence is over, the film seems moved to its second half; The outside world. For me this felt like a complete shift in the films pass and tone, which I believe was a great decision as it was almost simulating how our protagonists felt when they were welcomed back into society. However, I really feel that, whilst the trailer didn't take anything away from the film for me, it would of been better not to of shown the fact that they became free of 'Room' Great performances from everyone, an deeply emotional tone, and an overall great film to watch.One of the best 2015 had to offer."
"Emma Donoghue's novel, inspired no doubt by the likes of the Josef Fritzl case in Austria, 2008, has been rewritten by the author herself for the screen. It's a mighty challenging undertaking and benefits to some degree by not being 'based on a true story' even if the inspiration was so obviously horrifically apparent.It tells the tale of a young mother, credited as 'Ma' but actually known as Joy (how ironic) played to Oscar winning standard by Brie Larson and her five year old son, Jack, who was born in captivity some time after Joy was absconded by a man entrapping her with the aid of a sick puppy.Thus begins Joy's nightmare. At some point Jack is conceived at the hands of her rapist jailer, Old Nick, played by Sean Bridgers. (It's a casting that may have given him some personal nightmares because he's not what you could describe as a sympathetic character). It's fair to say that although Ma tolerates Nick's visitations, she has to to protect her child and to be fed, no Stockholm Syndrome has developed.The movie begins on or around Jack's fifth birthday. Jack has never left the room in which he was conceived and into which he entered his insular world. He knows no place other than this, has never experienced any weather (or air even), never played with other children, never been admonished for fear of upsetting a very delicate ecology between him, his mother and the 'room' where they live.Aside from the nightly visitations of Old Nick for the daily rape of his mother he knows no other human being.Ma and Jack have a TV, so Jack has a perverse awareness of the 'world' but it's seen through juddering images and is as real to him as martians are to you and I.But somehow Ma and Jack soldier on.We catch them at the end of Ma's tether. After five years of protecting Jack from the fact that they live in a parallel existence she's decided it's time for the facts of life and so begins a plan to escape. You'll have seen the trailers so you'll know that ultimately the escape bid is successful and so begins the painful psychological process of leaving an almost feral yet totally sheltered existence into a world that's overwhelming.Relationships in the family have moved on in the years since Joy's disappearance. Mum and Dad, although both still alive cope in very different ways. The media go mad for the story, Joy finds the whole thing extremely difficult to cope with and we spend a very moving hour or so watching them come to terms with an existence that's completely alien to Jack and totally overwhelming for Joy. This is a life affirming movie. It's directed with great skill and sensitivity by Lenny Abrahamson and in Brie Larson and five year old Jacob Tremblay we can pretty much believe that this is not fiction but very real reality.A remarkable film that deserves all the awards that are about to come its way.Deep respect."
"I had this movie for a while on my watch list because it had a pretty good rating, but I never really got into watching it, as the plot sounded kinda boring to me. Anyhow one day I was bored and decided to give it a try. There is a lot of action going on that never gets explanation and you kinda keep on waiting and waiting for the answers to come up, but in the end, there isn't that much of a plot at all. I was expecting for there to be some really mind boggling plot twist, but all I really got was child throwing tantrum to his mother. If I wanted to see that, I would go to local stores toy isle. Questions unanswered are: Why did the guy kidnap the woman in the first place? What was the lawsuit about? Why was her father unable to watch the grandchild? How could it be, that the kidnapper hadn't never seen the child living in his shed for five years or why was he not allowed?
Not to mention holes in plot, like how the woman was completely used to modern world after seeing it for the first time in 7 years, nor did she even seem impressed by anything. Or, why would she not try to escape? There was a window made out of plastic in roof, she surely could have broken it in 7 years of time.
After they are out of the ""Room"", there really isn't that much to be seen in this movie. Nothing happens."
"Although brutal at times, credit has to be given to The entire cast of Room for churning out one of the Masterpieces of this generation. Brie Larson has done a career defining role who i firmly Believe deserves every award this season but the ultimate acting ""masterclass"" at such a tender age has to be the kid playing her son. Imagine discovering whole world again right from the Beginning like you did when you were a kid. Remember the first time you saw a dog ? The First time you saw trees ? The first time you made a friend ? The first time you left your mom ? This movie shows subtleness of mom- child relationship in such a beautiful way that it Forced even a heartless beast like me cry. The movie never drags, is unapologetically intense Cinematography makes you feel like a 5 year Old again. The direction is immaculate and Script is powerful. Probably one of the best movies of 2015 ! Must watch :)"
"I didn't see Room (2015) when it first hit the theaters because I knew it would be something of a downer (or worse) and I tend not to opt for those. But that, of course, is pretty short-sighted. My wife thought I should watch it even if just to see Brie Larson in her Oscar-winning role before I went to see her as a big-budget superhero in Captain Marvel (2019), so we watched Room on Netflix this week. And of course she was right -- this is a carefully thought out and crafted film that sticks in the mind afterward. Although it's fictional, sadly it's not all that fictional. We read in the news all the time about kidnapping and abduction of young women for sex-trade purposes or worse.I'm not going to worry too much about ""spoilers"" in my review, coming 4 years after the fact -- the IMdB synopsis itself gives away the bare bones of the whole plot -- so I'll just go ahead with my reactions. Larson plays Joy Newsome (""Ma""), abducted on the street at age 17 by an unnamed predator (Sean Bridgers) who keeps her locked in his backyard shed as a sex slave (no other way to put it). 7 years later she now has a son, Jack (Jacob Tremblay) who has no knowledge of the world outside their Room except for what appears on TV. The first half of the movie shows them in their tiny, gruelling world day by day. Joy takes advantage of a temporary power outage to concoct an escape, which beyond all hope actually works. The second half of the movie is their adjustment after re-entry to the world outside (or in Jack's case, first-time entry).But no plot summary gets across the emotional impact and at-times surprising turns of the story. Though Jack is utterly bewildered at first by the reality of the larger world, as young children are very good at doing he adjusts, learns, adapts and accepts over the course of the next few weeks: meeting his grandparents, finally dressing and eating well, just being outside, making a neighborhood friend, delighting in the family dog. It's Joy who has much deeper trouble. After the Great Escape, dealing with the police and the doctors, and making the transition back to her own family home, things are not all rosy. She's unpredictably short-tempered; impatient; aimless; unhappy. She doesn't know what's wrong, experiences a physical breakdown. Shouldn't she be happy and fine? The obvious answer staring us in the face, of course, is that she's exhausted: flat-out, bone-deep exhausted, after 7 unrelenting years of captivity and five years looking out for her son every minute of every day -- protecting, feeding, training, teaching. Healing happens, but it takes far longer. This is a deeply sympathetic portrayal of a very ordinary person pushed far beyond ordinary limits, and Larson delivers every bit of it.Which brings me to the stylistic part of the movie. Everyone here is an ordinary person and acts that way. When abducted, Joy was an average high-school girl with no more personal resources or courage than average, pushed into an impossible situation. She has no particular training in dealing with motherhood, or sexual predators, or isolation and deprivation. Jack is what he is -- a kid with a kid's typical mix of behavior that is variously affectionate, obedient, self-centered, kind, shy, peevish, frightened. Their captor (""Old Nick"") is menacing but also banal -- a social loser who can't hold a job and has minimal competence. Joy's escape bears no resemblance to the kind of McGyver scheme that a normal action thriller hero would come up with; her plan is not really a very good one, is also extremely risky, but it is just bold enough to work. The police officers and doctors who find them and care for them are unspectacular in turn, but they are seen to do their jobs sympathetically and well. Finally, Joy's parents Nancy and Robert (played by major actors Joan Allen and William H. Macy, in strong supporting performances) are ordinary suburban dwellers who had been forced to presume their long-lost daughter was dead. In the intervening years they have separated, and Nancy has a new partner Leo (played very effectively indeed by Tom McCamus). Both Nancy and Leo turn out to be the strengths of their newly rebuilt family: Nancy takes over Jack when Joy cannot, and Leo succeeds in making friends with him while Robert finds that he cannot.The media feeding frenzy that usually accompanies sensational news stories like this ""Woman Held Captive for Seven Years Escapes! News at 8."") is shown too, but not all that much time is spent on it. What little we get, though, does not cast reporters in a very good light. We see one very telling scene where Joy consents to do a TV interview, and the interviewer (Wendy Crewson) sideswipes her with appallingly self-righteous, judgmental questions about what she did with her son.Lastly, a shout-out to young Jacob Tremblay. He was age 9 when making the film, playing a 5-year-old, and breathtakingly convincing at it. It never occurred to me while watching that he was that much older in reality. He's just as major a figure as Larson at carrying the movie and in certain sections has to effectively carry it alone. We know how Brie Larson's career has taken off (literally, in Captain Marvel!) but it's nice to see that Tremblay is beginning to make his mark as well in other features."
"Abducted and held in a backyard shed with a young son fathered by her captor, a young woman attempts to escape in this grim drama starring Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. Some of the finer plot details do not quite add up (in seven years of captivity, she should have been able to work out a four digit security code) and the first half of the movie is a tad repetitive. Things gets more interesting in the second half though with the escape plan in action and superb point-of-view shots as we literally and metaphorically see the world for the first time through the young boy's eyes. Tremblay is excellent as the youngster in question; not all his temper tantrums ring true, but he is great in the quieter moments in which he simply sits back and observes. In fact, the film is more about Tremblay than Larson even though she was the one who garnered all the awards attention. With all the focus on Tremblay though, several plot points feel undernourished; an impending trial, having to eventually tell Trembley who his father is, and acceptance of Trembley into the family are all issues that are mentioned once or twice and then later forgotten. Some have complained that the film runs too long but the ending comes as abrupt if anything with so many avenues left open. The uncertainty is arguably fitting though, and with two very solid lead performances, this is a hard film to look away from, but its resonance will vary depending upon how one feels about all the issues and ideas here that are unexplored to make room for its depiction of a boy seeing the world for the first time."
