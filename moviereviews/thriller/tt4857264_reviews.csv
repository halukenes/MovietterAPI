"Again, a successful example of a Spanish thriller-detective, who informally became a separate genre of world cinema. Moreover, the guest was shot by Oriol Paolo, a man who put his hand to such important tapes as ""Enlightenment"" (as a screenwriter) and ""Body"" (as a director and screenwriter).Quite often in Spanish cinema, the action does not immediately gain momentum, but only after a while. This film did not become an exception. Initially, ""Guest"" may seem boring and slightly tightened, but soon enough the story begins to add to the dynamics and does not let the viewer go until the final credits. It is worth noting how well the director builds the narrative, differently presented the same events and deftly manipulating our expectations. The story line perfectly fits the chic atmospheric music.In addition to the script, which is the main advantage of the tape, it is worth mentioning the cast of actors, represented by the colorful and highly sought-after in modern Spanish cinema Mario Casas (""Three meters above the sky"", ""Witches of Sugar-Murdi""), Jose Coronado (""Body"") and Anoy Wachener (""Beauty""). The presence in the frame of recognizable faces, undoubtedly, goes to the film for good.If you are not a connoisseur of the detective genre, or have not seen the previous work of Oriol Paolo, then the film outcome will certainly seem unpredictable and somewhat shocking to you. And those viewers who saw the same ""Body"", for certain will notice a certain similarity of these two pictures and the repetition of the director himself. All this, however, does not cancel the fact that the ""Invisible Guest"" is quite a worthy representative of its genre and at least one viewing deserves it.The invisible guest is a one-time and far from ideal but intriguing and atmospheric psychological detective with elements of a thriller with worthy acting work, an ornate story and worthy final revelation."
"Over the past months I've realized how much improvement have Spanish movies and series done in their works. However, when it comes to thrillers, I tend to be very selective and delicate because there are a lot of elements to take into consideration.The Invisible Guest accomplish almost all the elements in any checklist of a perfect thriller-suspense movie. The script forces you to think quickly, you can't get distracted for a second because you'll miss an important detail. The story is told in a puzzling-kind of way, letting you feel like you finally know what is going on, just to tear your expectation apart with a new shocking truth. Some of the actors did a pretty good job. A remarkable performance was the one from Victoria Goodman. The music is absolutely engaging. The twisted feeling you get with the melody traps you into the story. The different tones and volumes of the music actually happen in agreement with the intensity of the sequence. 100% RECOMMENDED."
"I wont explain anything, it would be a waste of time. My only review is this: WATCH THIS MOVIE RIGHT NOW!!!!!!"
"Can't believe this movie doesn't have more reviews here. This being my 6th movie with Mario Casas I've seen these past 2 years I can honestly say anything this man plays in becomes a hit.What an amazing ride I had with this thriller. Top-notch movie, whenever you think you found out the plot it becomes even more twisted.This is what thrillers are all about. A must see for the genre lovers."
"This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. The incredible performances of the main actress along with fantastic story line make this movie unforgettable.
The end is really amazing, the movie keeps pointing you to wrong directions all the time, until eventually reveals the whole truth.This movie is simply .. . extraordinary. I am so happy because I have watch this movie. It's an art!My rating is 9/10 ."
"I haven't seen many Spanish movies so far, but I can honestly say that Contratiempo/Invisible Guest is about to be brilliant. I am not familiarized with the actors from the cast, but I can say that their acting is a very good performance and all the filming crew made a good job with this one ! Filming angles, soundtrack, story line, cast, plot, etc, all of them are a lot above the average thriller/mystery clich√©s that Hollywood got us used to, but still it has some minor issues that, in my opinion, of course, I would have changed. Those 'little problems' made me to decide this movie is a 9, not a 10, a 10 would be a perfect masterpiece, however, this one approaches perfection somehow. 1 hour and 46 minutes are surprisingly enough for this film, even if it may seem too little for a 9-rated movie, for the entire time I didn't get bored or badly surprised, it was just very thrilling and full of action and mystery. Contratiempo is, in my opinion, a must watch for thriller/mystery enthusiasts and legal movie fans."
"Being an avid Thriller watcher, I came across this Gem by accident....and what an adventure this movie takes you on. Who Done It, comes to mind and just when you have solved it, it then twists you into another scenario. It is in Spanish and there are Subtitles, but it doesn't take away from this masterpiece. Well done, Oriol Paulo for his direction, and well done on the film editing. I will be watching out for more of Paulo's films. Well and truly worth the watch."
"Wow, just wow. I'm and avid fan of thriller movies, but this one give me goosebumps. Jose Coronado always steal the show since I see him for the first time in another great Spanish thriller, ""El Cuerpo"". For one moment, you think you have all the pieces of the puzzles but the director of this masterpiece persistently change the answers and the questions. By the way, the director and writer of ""Contratiempo"" is the same one of ""El Cuerpo"". That's not a coincidence, Mr. Oriol Paulo can write. If you're a fan of thriller movies and you're having a hard time trying to find a good movie, this is the one. I say it's better that the 85% of the Hollywood thrillers these days. Another Spanish film that beat a lot of Hollywood movies without the promo and a gigantic budget. What a masterpiece!"
"Saw this recently on a DVD. The movie is an excellent suspense thriller. It was full of twists and surprises. The movie has unexpected turns n hidden clues. It is masterfully directed n exquisitely written by Oriol Paulo. Superbly acted by everyone that appears in it. It also contains beautiful cinematography, great pacing n skilled editing. The plot- a powerful businessman stands accused of murdering his lover. He was found with her dead body in a locked hotel room. The twist ending will leave you with ur hand on ur head. The director's debut film, The Body has been on my radar for a long time. Fans of Jagged edge, Primal fear, Usual suspects will definitely enjoy this."
"One of the best thrillers I have seen in a long time. Brilliant acting, script, directing. Bravo Spain!"
"I'm widely known for enjoying French cinema, however I believe this is the first Spanish film I have ever seen. I'm glad to confirm that it will not be my last, because this movie was incredible. It was the type of film that I like more than any other type. A mystery thriller that is guaranteed to have a twist. It's also a type of movie that Americans don't do overly well. They always seem to think that a movie needs endless car chases and shoot-outs and that the story should just be there to facilitate those. The Europeans seem to understand that the true brilliance in cinema comes from the writing side of things. The intricate webs they weave never cease to astound me.It's always a little hard to judge acting in a subtitled film, but I'm pretty confident in saying the acting in this film was superb. The entire cast found a perfect balance of charisma and mysteriousness to surround their character. The story is crafted exquisitely and has a lot of rewatchability factor. In fact it's almost a must to watch it again, knowing what you now know. I love films that do that.It's very hard to find any negatives with this film. In fact I've just spent 5 minutes trying to come up with some and failed. That should indicate just how good this movie is. I hope films like this never stop being made because they are an absolute delight to watch."
"Still speechless, I've come here to write this review. This movie is one of the best movies I've ever seen. PERIOD. I loved it and am sure YOU will too. I caught myself being suspicious of the final outcome but it was nothing near as close as it turned out to be. Watch it. It's thrilling, emotional, suspenseful, mind-blowing, an edge-of-your-seat movie. These Spanish movies really are something. They manage to put you on an emotional roller coaster and show you something you never thought a movie could do. WOW!"
Can't believe I didn't see that coming!!! Watched several times
"Having just watched this film and having read most of its reviews, I can tell you just one thing. This is an ""A-S-T-O-N-I-S-H-I-N-G"" THRILLER. Please do yourselves a big favor and watch this genuine MASTERPIECE. Oh my God !!!"
"This is a movie where when paying attention to every scene the viewer is rewarded with meaningful and purposeful action and dialog not suspecting that all the while something is afoot but what? That's why you stay tuned and glued to the screen not wanting to miss out on what is being acted out or presented. This is the first time I have come across this type of thriller. You see not only does this movie entertain but it also challenges you to take a side and share a point of view that when done is doubted because of the next scene and what takes place. Just when you think you have a reasonable explanation for what is and has taken place, a new fact enters in making you say ""what is going on"" in a good way. At that point, you are wholly committed and don't know that you have been captured and the movie now has you in its grasp. This is quality entertainment. Kudos to the story teller, the director and actors for pulling off a nice memorable movie that you will want to not only discuss but recommend as well. I always watch Netlfix with subtitles because I have learned so much goes on in movies that one may miss and the sub titles make little comments like wind blowing or so & so is speaking or car door slamming enabling the viewer to become intimate with the flick. My wife and I read every line and even rewound a couple of scenes to see if we were ""getting this"". All and all a good, decent ride. Highly recommend sunflower seeds or popcorn so you don't chew your nails to shreds and forget about any and all distractions (cell phone) too. Give this movie your time and it will give you a nice return on that time guaranteed"
Haven't seen a perfect suspense thriller like this in the longest time. A must watch. Perfecto!!
"Thrillers, as I see them, I not simply another action film. Thrillers thrill! That's it, simple as it may sound. And this titles thrills! From the first minute to the very end of the film we enjoy what we see. The plot is great and what a direction! Great! I highly recommend ""Contratiempo""."
"I'm not very familiar with all the Spanish actors and actresses but I'm sure the ones in this movie must be the better ones from Spain. Because the acting is really good in Contratiempo or The Invisible Guest. The story is everything you want when you want to watch a mystery crime thriller. It's never boring, with plenty of twists and turns. All you want to do is know how this story will end. It keeps your attention from the first second till the last one. I saw plenty of Spanish movies and some are really good, way above average. This one is definitely one of the good ones. If you look for a good entertaining mystery movie search no further and watch The Invisible Guest. You won't regret it."
I can not believe how this ended! (SHOCKING)! YOU WILL NOT SEE THIS COMING!
"This is a top-notch thriller about a young businessman called Adri√°n Doria (Mario Casas) contracts an advocate at law (Ana Wagener) who attempts to prove his innocence for a strange crime of his lover (Barbara Lennie) happened at a luxury hotel , but events are about to get even worse .

"It starts as a potentially good thriller, but at some point, it starts dragging with one twist after the other, and the story becomes less enjoyable and much less believable (such as, ordinary folks with super spy capabilities, and supposedly smart people acting dumbly). I can understand why some would be wowed by this sort of twists and turns, but I've seen so many movies of the genre I'm not easily amazed. It's just adding twists for the sake of it, because that's what they do in these movies, in the hope of misleading the viewer (but it's not hard to predict the ending half way through). It's not terrible but I didn't fully enjoy it."
This movie is a masterpiece. The actors performance is outstanding and the plot is unpredictable and mind-blowing.
"Don't know what more to say about this amazingly well directed and executed movie, it's a masterpiece, a gem! Why don't we get to see more of such movies from Hollywood and elsewhere, I mean this is one brilliant example of what a great movie can be made like. The moment I finished watching it, I told myself THiS is the kind of movie that makes me love cinema and movies so much! Don't know what more to say....Check it out for yourself!"
"It started off quite okay. But somewhere in the middle there's and explosion of possible narratives and each tries to trump over the one before. That gets a bit ridiculous, like: ""What if x happened?"", ""Yeah, but was if y happened?"", ""I see your cool story, bro and raise you that z happened!""
At that point the ultimate ""twist"" at the end can be seen in advance and left me wondering about some plotholes. It had a lot of potential to be really cool, but it tried too hard and became a satire of the genre."
"This movie is simply .. . extraordinary. I am so happy because I have watch this movie. It's an art!And, I have to say, Mario Casas is excellent actor. I'd like to meet him. I hope, this year I'll visit Spain. Many Spanish movies and series are magnificent. For example: Internado, El Barco, Fisica o quimica, Rec, and the others.Love Spain ‚ô•"
Enjoyable but 1) things take unexpected turns so often it becomes tiring and 2) seriously everyone paying attention can tell the final twist halfway through the movie
"A riveting thriller, written with wit, precision and nerve, directed with great visual flair, and acted by a group of actors who must have loved every ambiguous note in the roles they played - and played them to perfection. With plenty of flashbacks within flashbacks and narratives within narratives, but always perfectly clear and taut, this movie is everything a mystery should be. Personally, I love whodunits. I especially love them I know I can't trust what I'm seeing and when I suspect the answer is being flaunted right before my eyes but I'm so engaged in the story I don't have time to figure it out. Well, this is it. Absolutely engaging from the start and with the kind of ending you never forget.A 10. Not to be missed."
"It's a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma how this movie got such a high rating.
It doesn't contain goofs. The movie as a whole is one big endless goof. The plot is full of holes so it looks like a fisherman's net. Let's start with the obvious ones.
-The movie begins with Adrian calling his wife and telling her that he's in Paris. His lawyer supposedly falsifies the hotel and flight records (which is highly implausible). However, investigators definitely checked Adrian's home phone record and could easily establish that the call was actually made from Spain. That means the movie ends here.
-Then the investigators find out that the call was made from a hotel where Adrian parked his car. Adrian claims that his car was stolen from the parking lot. Since later Laura drives that car which was serviced by Tomas Garrido, this implies that Laura was the thief?
-Daniel's car didn't hit any obstacle, didn't turn over, the air bags didn't pop up, and its windshield stayed intact. How in the world could Daniel be fatally injured in that accident?
Laura says that his belt was not buckled. But what difference does it make if Daniel's ""corpse"" didn't move an inch from his comfortable position in the driver's seat?
-Just looking at Daniel, Adrian and Laura decide that he is dead. Later Adrian reveals that Daniel was actually very alive. Didn't two lovers mention that Daniel is breathing? Why didn't they check his pulse?
-There was absolutely no sensible justification for getting rid of Daniel's body. The lovers didn't do anything wrong. If they didn't want to reveal their affair, Adrian could just walk away. Anyway Laura stayed alone in his car.
-It is impossible to sink a car in the water by just pushing it from the shore. To do that one needs to push the car from a cliff or a bridge.
-Laura transfers a big amount of money from the bank where Daniel worked. Where the money was transferred to? The investigators could easily check the internet IP address from which the transfer was made. And that would lead them to Laura.
-Adrian pulls out of his account 100,000 euro in cash and in small bills. Any bank in Europe would report it, especially, when the account owner is under investigation as a major suspect in a murder. Police would immediately bring him for interrogation.
-The hotel room where Laura's body was found immediately becomes the crime scene. Anyway, a hotel employee not only enters the crime scene but she also succeeds to lock the window (a critical evidence) in a room filled with police officers.
-The false lawyer Virginia Goodman talks to Adrian for a couple of hours while her face is getting very close to him. She is wearing a silicon mask, and Adrian doesn't mention that? That's childish.
I give this movie just one star because it insulted my intelligence. At these days many movie producers are working to entertain unscrupulous viewers without paying attention to the truth and with minimum care about the details."
"Another awesome mystery-thriller from the writer-director of ""El Cuerpo"". Oriol Paulo has become an official guarantee for a top Spanish thriller - I just hope it doesn't take him another 4 years to make his next film! With Hitchcockian moments (the blood dripping from the car....), escalating tension, and a constant stream of twists & reversals, ""Contratiempo"" is thoroughly engrossing viewing. The final twist is of the best kind: it absolutely floors you, AND makes you want to kick yourself for missing it at the same time. A must-see if you like the genre. *** out of 4."
Best mystery movie I've ever seen I can't believe this movieüé•üé•
"Perfect movie. If it was from US, rating would be 9.5."
"This movie is a masterpiece movie. This is the only Spanish movie I have watched, but it worth watching such this one. For people who like mystery and crime movies, so this is the one you should watch. I do not want to ruin the story to tell what the series in this movie is, rather I really recommend you to enjoy the story yourself."
"Since the first moment you get attached to the characters, their stories seem plausible and you don't feel any of them are guilty. But not everything can be true and the careful construction of the events, like in Agatha Christie novels keeps you intrigued till the end.Excellent play for the main actor, Mario Casas, but even better for the lawyer, Ana Wagener."
"This movie is almost a masterpiece. It deserves a solid 8/10. Just when you think you understand it, the movie reminds you of the complexity of the situation and throws another mystery at you.the acting is outstanding, especially from the actress who portrays the lawyer. There are few unexplained plot holes that didn't bother me that much. The viewer experience is amazing, so if you're not familiar with Spanish movies, you should definitely start with this one !"
"SPOILERS It well enough acted and interestingly written, but why oh why did they make the 'twist' so obvious? The Mother and the ""exert"" who arrive are both of extremely similar build and wear similar glasses: it's like the transformation from Clark Kent to Superman, anyone who's observant must have seen the climax coming a mile away. I was actually thinking there must be some other twist, like it was the son in woman's makeup.Will please many, but disappoint those seeking originality."
"All hollywood directors should be asked to watch this spanish gem and learn the basics of story telling,editing ,music,etc of a mainstream thriller that thrills and keeps you on the edge of the seat.
No matter the holes in the script or the acting,etc the whole package is a superb piece of film making and reminds you of some of the Korean classics in the genre.
The director's previous attempts have been great but this one does it the best!
Unmissable!"
"If you are someone who ran out of good movies to watch and been disappointed of watching movies that looked good only on posters and felt un-satisfied by even some of the successful movies out there. This is it! this one would break your fast!As a growing movie lover I look for certain details in a movie like clarity in dialogue, unique narration style, less or no animations, pleasing locations, just necessary background score and brilliant climax. This one checks all the boxes for me.Sometime when a movie ends it leaves you with a silence, a feel good silence, a silence that feels like a satisfaction and the silence breaks after a while when someone interrupts you but I let that silence continue for a long-time for this one. That's me feeling my inner-piece after this movie."
"Over-acted, over the top dramatic music and full of far fetched plot twists."
"Do yourself a favour & see this film!! That's all I'm saying!! Don't forget to turn off your mobiles, you don't want any interruptions!! üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç"
"This movie blew me away. This maybe the best suspense movie I have ever seen. The actors, the screenplay, the twists/turns and the climax - Just wow. Without sounding too fake, I would suggest you to simple go ahead and watch this movie, you will love it."
"Magnificent movie, it keeps you tensed till the end! The spanish film industry can be proud of so many good and original movies!"
"Stylish, with a very twisty plot that treats the viewer with respect. Excellently paced with some great scenes of tension. Clever plotting that a lot of Hollywood productions should learn from. It treats its viewers as intelligent and can follow a plot without the typical Hollywood 'quick reminder' via an inserted flashback of something the viewer saw just 10 minutes or so ago and the preview audiences couldn't grasp. Sigh.Beautifully understated camera work that allows the story to be told without flashy excess whilst still looking superb.Highly recommended for viewers that like their thrillers well told and complexly structured."
So i just watched this masterpiece and i am still in hangover if you have 'fight club' and liked it so this is you lady grab it and without getting bored the camera work the environment the acting the direction everything is good and you can never guess on any occasion whats happening this is a must watch film anyone can enjoy it and i gave it 10/10 its that good
"After La Casa De Papel (Money Heist) this is my second venture into Spanish Cinema. And I must say I'm impressed. Amazing storyline, gripping characters and tons of surprises. Need to explore more."
"The thrills and suspense begin very good, but then the story goes completely downhill, with stupid, nonsense twists, ending with a completely disappointing finale. The twist in the ending is so stupid that I needed a little time to clear my head from all that bullshit. I really wanted to like this movie but it just wasted nearly 2 hours of my life. Stupid as fu*k!"
"Magnificent movie, it keeps you tensed till the end! The spanish cinema can be proud of it's many good and original movies."
"The plot builds so gradually and beautifully that by the time it has reached its crescendo you are basically breathless! Fantastically written to really put you on edge and tickle your curiosity. 
I am so fussy with thrillers because it is easy to over do everything but this is really a great film. I will definitely be investigating more Spanish Thrillers (and films in general) because of this."
"A masters , do not miss it u will fell in love with it"
"There were a lot of places where it was hard to watch as the story dragged on too muchShould you watch it? Yes, but keep in mind in that there are a lot of twists and turns - most of them unnecessary but in the end you will get some closure."
"I can't believe how low cost this movie is and they could still pull off some amazing twist and content, simply astonishing! Pay attention to every single detail or else you would miss something out! A MUST WATCH!"
"Good thriller with a lot of twists and turns, very sleek and stylish. Mario Casas is very bland, however his personality suits his role here.
The photography is not always as good as it could have been.
A lot of the twists feel unrealistic and the dialogue sometimes feels forced, however one should keep in mind that most of it is speculation or told as a story by the main character.
Although not perfect, very entertaining and fresh."
"An amazing movie, Spanish production! I was cautious at first but then it surprised me! It's keeping you in suspense till the end! The finale is so subversive! Congratulations!"
"Fantastic movie with a fantastic end.
Must watch this movie and the el cuerpo from same director.
If you like mystery and thriller must see this one. My rate is 9/10"
"First of all, the actors are very good. There is a little overacting by one character, imo, but overall a very talented cast. It is also shot very nicely. If you are new to the genre, you might not see the ""twist"", but if you watch a lot of mysteries or thrillers odds are it will become glaringly obvious very early. If you work it out early on, you might begin to feel the way I did (or maybe not) but it started to become a bit tedious. It is not a waste of time or terrible, but neither is it mind blowing or anything you haven't seen before if you watch this type of movie or program a lot. I would recommend it for a rainy day or if your in the mood for an atmospheric thriller, but just know the secret isn't that tough to work out so it might end up being more of a drama than a mystery."
"This film has similarities with the film ""The Body"" Both films are perfect. And must watch before you die ."
"My, oh, my! First 'El cuerpo/The body' and now this. Spanish cinematography does not fail to impress. This has been their most successful thriller by far, and I believe there will be more. Having Mario Casas in a movie by itself is a reason enough to see this movie, and did he deliver! The acting is astonishing, this world deserves more Spanish actors, but the directing was a pure masterpiece. Orioul Paulo is a man to be reckoned with. Throughout the movie, the plot will take you on numerous emotional and moral roller coasters, and every time you think you know it right, the plot will mercilessly prove you wrong. I enjoyed the movie from the first seconds till the last ones. If you are willing to dive into the depths of Spanish thrillers, this is the best movie to begin your journey with."
"I just can't believe i'v waited this long to watch this masterpiece, it is definitely without a doubt one of the best movies i'v watched in the year 2016/2017 and absolutely on the top 5 Spanish movies.The Plot is just so strong and the thrill is congested in each and every minute of it,, the timeline separation style (where the movie jumps back and forth between two timelines like the present event and the story in the past using flashbacks) is not a new style , but here the execution was so precise and flawless , there was no time to breath and the events kept on elevating with more tense with so many versions where you can't decide who's the killer and what really happened will at least not until the end where all is revealed.The script is amazing no disagreement in here, but what surpassed my expectation is the directing !!! i mean WOW, for a 42 young man from Barcelona Oriol Paulo excelled by doing both at once ... i watched his other movie ""El cuerpo"" and man you know this guy is something special.As for the cast, Mario Casas is one talented man, his face expressions just drags you so deep into the scene , same goes for Ana Wagener ... the flashbacks were pivotal in the movie but the one to one dialogue between these two was just suspenseful.Also not to forget the genius soundtracks and the music composing, each and every scene had this perfect tune that made it look even more thrilling.Lastly, you just stop reading reviews and go watch the ""damn"" thing because it is ""damn"" worth every minute of your time."
"I actually enjoyed this, until the very last part.
Is it a clever plot with a shocking twist? No.The final ""twist"", if you can call it that, was ridiculous because it had been so obvious by that time.
I even thought to myself, maybe that wouldn't be the twist because, I mean, hello?! They weren't even trying to hide it properly. It would be absolutely dumb if that were the twist.Turns out it was.I had really hoped that wasn't it, that there was more to this because I rather enjoyed the build-up.
I was cringing at the grand reveal because it seemed they were expecting me to be so shocked and mind blown about it.Uh... no sorry.They could've done this much much better, it's like they were confident people will not notice or figure it out.
But then again there are those who they will be able to fool.
It's just a shame I wasn't one of them."
Awesome movie for thriller genre. Enjoyed a lot hooked to svreen till last minute. A note of advise: Beware of spoilers before watching.
"I always loved movies which had something surprising and thrilling like seven, zodiac, prisoners, Dial m for murder etc ( the list goes on). and also foreign movies like The body, secret in their eyes, memories of murder...so i decided to give this movie a go, since it had positive reviews all around. Story wise: the movie had a good plot, some good twists along the way, but for me during the halfway stages it became a little bit predictable. ( cant go too much into the story ) At the end i was like ""oh okay"",its not comparable to the body, Secret in their eyes etc but still a good one. Acting wise : Everyone was good, but loved the acting of the father of the deceased. If u love a good engaging thriller, and there's time to pass i would say give it a go."
"A locked-room Spanish murder mystery originally released under the title Contratiempo from Mexico (or not. Lineage is not certain on this film), there is a point in this fascinating story where you go, ""Wait a minute. How can that happen?"" And you think you're some kind of Sherlock because, aha! You have discovered the flaw in the movie! But you haven't, because the thing that you thought happened DIDN'T happen, and you won't know that until the last few minutes. Very cool."
"According to what Adri√°n said to the police (not necessarily the true story), he was attacked by someone and hit the mirror, then this ""someone"" murdered Laura. And people in the hallway heard the sound that the ""someone"" hit Laura with the weapon. But at the end, what really happened is that Adri√°n hit Laura first, people in the hallway heard the noise and gathered around, then he hit the mirror to make it looked like someone framed him. But if that's the case, people should hear the noise of him hitting the mirror AFTER the noise of him hitting Laura. Then the police should know he was lying. But seems no one suspected about it."
"Very questionable actions by protagonist, a random guy who makes no attempt to arouse sympathy from the beginning of the film; in aggregate with less than realistic course of events puts this brummagem below par compared to a proper mystery titles.Expressionless."
"If you're nostalgic for the good old days of the brilliantly-written thrillers, you're in for a treat!
It is smart, surprising, suspenseful, the plot seems quite simple in the beginning but grows incrementally, up to the point where you realize you hadn't figured it out like you thought you did.
I don't wanna spoil the fun, so I'm not going to say more, but there's no way you will be disappointed by this gem."
"I am a great fan of crime thriller movies. The last thriller movie I was speechless was ""Gone Girl"" it's been 3 years I was keep on searching n watching some useless movies. Never watched a Spanish movie before but I must say I'm speechless again after 3 years.. what a plot, music, writing and editing. Everything is so engaging till the end.. a must watch for everyone even with the subtitles you will not be distracted... 10+"
"Quite simply a superb thriller you absolutely have to watch!
Also highly recommend to watch another movie by the same director ""El cuerpo"" another masterpiece!"
"Simply one of the best thrillers I had seen in many years.
Having watched 'The Body' before, and now this; Oriol Paulo is definitely a name to be reckoned with.
This movie is simply flawless; the plot, the acting, the twists, and the finale... I'm beyond impressed, a true Masterpiece.
Please leave whatever you are doing and watch it now.
Can't wait for Paulo's Upcoming movies."
Until the end you really don't know what is going on!!! Totally off the rocker!!!!
"One of the best films,........,................
Long thinking,..."
"Hollywood stop for 2hrs, watch this movie, take note and learn ...! this is one of the best movie I've ever seen, please do yourselves a big favor and watch this genuine masterpiece ..."
"It's amazing really you have to watch it, specially if you like mystery movies"
"Being so sick of the usual same story lined movies, I saw this one got a good rating, so I watched it. I'm over apocalypse, zombie, killer-in-the-woods, killer-in-the-house, possessions, Aliens; I just couldn't take it anymore. Decided to watch the subtitles. Boy, was I glad I did. It's a psychological film with depth as well as twists and turns. Thought so highly of it, I actually clapped at the end."
"As you would expect from spanish production of thriller movies this is quite unpredictable, deeply twisted and the ending is as you would assume unexpected. Mario Casas is brilliant.
Recommend for all the genre lovers"
"A superbly directed and acted tale of cross, double cross, lies and more lies. The beauty of this movie is the pace is never forced and allows the events to proceed at a natural canter neither being overly simplistic nor too convoluted to lose the viewer. I continually kept trying to second guess what I would do in such a situation. Without giving any spoilers, I would strongly recommend this film."
"The plot is full of twists and whenever you try to guess what happened , they shock you with an event ,a well-done thriller movie with an unexpected ending ."
