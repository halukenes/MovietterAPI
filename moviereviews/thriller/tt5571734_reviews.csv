"More than half of the seats empty in the theater at an afternoon show of ""Pink"" gives us the message whats exactly wrong with Bollywood. Replacing the movie with Dabangg or other such worthless crap, shows would be house-full. Pink is a masterpiece and lives up to it's expectations. Powerful and world-class performances given by Amitabh Bachchan sir (once again) and Piyush Mishra makes this movie a gem. This is one of the career best performance by Big B. He runs the whole show. Tapsee's acting could have been so much better; but still, it was a job well done. The movie deals with what we read daily in our newspapers. MOLESTATION. This movie depicts the corrupt system and shows it in a brutally honest way (personal experience). I'd say go for this movie, you'll surely love it. Fans of Amitabh will get =a bombastic surprise! ;)"
"When a girl says NO, (she could be anyone, your girl friend, your date, your wife or even a sex worker). it means a NO. This is exactly the point which PINK drives to the audience, all the while shaking up our conscience and questioning ourselves. Minal Arora (Taapsee Pannu) Falak Ali (Kriti Kulhari) and Andrea (Andrea Tariang) are three friends and room mates who choose to go to a rock concert and run into Rajveer Singh (Angad Bedi) and his friends. The girls are invited for dinner which they choose to accept and it is implied that Rajveer and his friends tried to act fresh with the girls and Minal in an act of self defense hits Rajveer with a bottle, making him almost lose an eye. Both the parties choose not to go to the law enforcement authorities and few days later, the girls are threatened by phone calls and their house owner is given threats to have the girls thrown out. Minal goes to the police and reports the incident which happened that night and an FIR is filed. But to her shock, she is arrested on the charges of prostitution and murder attempt.Steps in Deepak Sehgal (Amitabh Bachan) a once famous elderly lawyer who has quit practice mainly due to his bipolar disorder. Sehgal offers to defend the girls in a case which almost appears to be a lost cause as the girls are subjected to humiliation and are portrayed as criminals.Amitabh Bachan as Sehgal gives once again a magnificent performance, his gas mask, his blank stares in the courtroom all add up to his fantastic portrayal of the character. Taapsee Pannu gives the best performance of her career, her body language, her mumbling, frightened looks and especially the scene where Sehgal calls her to the stand, make it the most outstanding performance of the year. Kriti Kulhari need s a special mention, especially in the breakdown scene on the stand.Angad Bedi is good as well and actually makes us loath the character, especially in the final cross-examination scene which brings out the double standards the society is into.Screenplay by Ritesh Shah deserves applause and especially the dialogues when Sehgal lists out the safety standards for women/girls.Direction by Aniruddha Roy Chowdhary is classy and does not deviate from the plot with inane sub plots. Right from the word go, he ensures every scenes grips our conscience and tugs us into self- examination.I would not recommend it to anyone who wants to watch flashy item songs, or duets set in Switzerland or out of the world costumes. This movie is for patrons who are into serious cinema and can appreciate good performances."
"Yes, its finally here.The movie i was waiting for so long. first of all,i will like to finally say this thing that after a long leap of time i felt goosebumps watching a Bollywood film.Last time was for ""Titli"". And it was an Honour to see Mr.Bachchan in such a terrific role. every one was just phenomenal. Piyush Mishra did a good job as well. and those three girls Of course,what a great privilege for them to share screen with the Shehanshah himself.:) The movie will be having a good grip on you through out the Runtime The movie is not ""Damini"" of modern age. This is a tight slap on all those so called ""Sanskari uncles and aunties"" that judge girls by what they wear. Every person not just a male,but this is was for every gender. It asks just a single question to the society i.e ""WHY"" why don't you just let girls do whatever they want to do. At least let them smile or laugh for god sake. please don't just wait for someone to point out some faults in your daughter,sister or mother. If you can worship ""female gods"" then for god sake just respect the ones you have in your society."
"Pink is not a film and this is not a review..A dialogue from Rang De Basanti – ""Koi Bi desh perfect nevi ho ta hai..use perfect banana parta hai"" – and for that one needs to change the various aspects of societal mindset. #Pink is not just a film but a statement against this prejudiced, hypocritical feudal societal fabric that can't handle modern-thinking women.Two major point raised without being didactic:- 1.Stop being judgmental. A modern working woman who wears short (I would say more comfortable in this humid climate) clothes or one who parties & drinks or one who is friendly doesn't mean SHE IS AVAILABLE. SO STOP LABELING HER..2.Most vital point – NO MEANS NO..She can be your friend, GF, sex-worker, even your wife : NO means No. I am sure even most educated men won't get this point but I hope they does..Honestly Shoojit Sircar (who is synonymous with quality films Vicky Donor Madras Cafe Piku) & debutante Dir Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury should be applauded for The Film Pink as it has the power to change mindset. Hope Pink is watched at a large scale, start a debate and inspire young adults. Going by the reactions all over I guess the movement has just began, that is Power of Great Cinema.Kudos to Amitabh Bachchan to be part of such a topical film demanding respect.His acting and choice of films are getting better and better with old-age..This issue was necessary to be told and his name would increase the audience base. Tapsee Pannu and Kirti Kulhari are a revelation. Their pain reflects the voice of majority of Indian women who have to face ordeals even in the busiest of streets in our country. Angad Bedi is so authentic that you will hate him. Debutante Andrea Tariang is effortless. And can Piyush Mishra & Dhritiman Chatterjee go wrong in any role? Pink is indeed a taut social thriller which needs your attention.It is taut and gritty and it establishes its plot-points effectively keeping the tension intact. And while doing so it makes evident points against the society. The court-room sequences in the 2nd half is tremendously superb. As a cinema it is Talvar of 2016 albeit with a straight plot-line.Btw, Do watch the end credit.."
"Just seen PINK the movie and I would like admit that nothing has moved me so much as this movie did. Superb Acting by Tapsee Pannu She is probably the best we got in bollywood, Amitabh Bacchan did a very intense and powerful character and uplifted the role in his own charisma, His acting skills shows the reason why he is the biggest bollywood star ever. Director precisely enlights the deep rooted problems and harassments faced by women specially in metros and the immaturity of the society who blindly judge a woman's character by the way she dresses, talk or work. We badly needs these kind of movies to awake the generic thoughts of people who thinks that they can Objectify women and Misuse the power against them. I recommend all of you to watch this great movie. It's a Thought Provoking and a giant leap in movies what we usually watch in bollywood."
"It correctly deals with the present mentality of our generation.Three young working women, Minal (Tapasee Pannu), Falak (Kirti Kulhari) and Andrea (Andrea Tairang) are flatmates in Delhi and good friends. An untoward incident one night at a resort in Surajkund, involving some boys, among whom is Rajveer (Angad Bedi), who comes from a politically well-connected family, proves to be life changing for the trio.What follows is an intriguing courtroom drama where ace lawyer Deepak Sehgall represents them in a bid to get them justice.Replete with contemporary instances and issues, centering around women and their safety, the film, through its potent dialogues, takes a dig at society and its stereotypical norms and prejudices towards women, as in ""The Rule Book of the Girls' Safety Manual"", enumerated by lawyer Deepak Sehgall.Director Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury extracts natural performances from all his actors, and makes a meaningful film devoid of any unnecessary commercial trappings, never once deviating from the core theme.Amitabh Bachchan as Deepak Sehgall, the aged defense lawyer, shines as always, in a restrained, but powerful performance. His histrionics come primarily in the form of his well-modulated baritone, conveying his emotions and of course, from the well-written lines.RIGHTLY SAID BY AMIT JI..WE Should SAVE OUR BOYS NOT OUR GIRLS"
"When I read the reviews I thought this movie would be interesting like a typical whodunit- crosses-courtroom drama. When the credits rolled I walked away impressed.Pink is a tour de force. It's a simmering mixture of morality, drama, mystery and debate whose intensity never slips. I can't recall one Bollywood movie in recent memory which has such taut seriousness that never flags. Pink has no light moments. And it is utterly brilliant. Part of its brilliance lie in Pink's on-the-money portrayal of biases and confusion surrounding independent, headstrong women in modern Indian society. Shoojit Sarkar brings to light darker biases that most modern Indians - men and women - carry but won't admit to.The narrative is his secret sauce in ensuring that none of the morality or gravitas ever slip into preachy frivolosity. It's an impactful movie on a serious issue that deserves praise for not trivializing the issues it tackles.Amitabh Bacchhan is brilliant as always and so are the girls and all supporting actors in the way they bring believability and emotion to their non stereotypical roles.A great watch - you'd definitely not end disappointed."
"The site's movie description says, 'When three young women are implicated in a crime; a retired lawyer steps forward to help them clear their names'. WOW! that's it? That's enough to describe this masterpiece right? Well there's more to this movie than just this sentence. First of all, this movie if put on a filmy metric scale would show the real potential of the Bollywood's film making ability. This film is an answer to all those movie lovers who were eagerly waiting for an amazing content in Hindi cinema for a long time. This is hence an important film for the entire Indian cinema fraternity. 'PINK' in its title itself is unique and it says a lot. This film throws light on the most appearing news on Indian tabloids and unfortunately that's the most ignored news as well,which is 'violence against women'. And that's exactly why this film is so important. The writer dedicates the entire first half to set the plot and foundation with the help of some terrific performances by each and every cast. The second half is a seat gripping court room drama, where Deepak Sehgal (Amitabh Sir) lists a set of 'rules' during the proceeding of the case in court. These rules are nothing but the ways in which modern day women are being stereotyped in our country. Finally he concludes his arguments by explaining the meaning of the smallest yet powerful word 'NO'...and A NO MEANS NO. Let's hope that the cynical, misogynistic, chauvinistic men population of our nation will understand its meaning after watching this movie, at least now! A special applause for the three lead actresses Tapsee Pannu, Kirti Kulhari, and Andrea Tariang who pulled their roles off with ease. Needless to mention our shehenshah, when his mere voice can play such roles brilliantly, its a 'baayen haath ka khel' for him. After a spectacular performance in Te3n and now with this film, I think he's a strong contender for the 2016 national award for the best actor. I don't want to find any flaw, So its a must watch people,don't miss such exceptional movies and complaint later that Bollywood doesn't make sensible movies. More than everything, the concepts like 'ZERO FIR' are so informative and the points like 'women and minors can get bail on weekends and the bail proceedings can be heard at a judge's residence on Saturday and Sunday' needs to be educated to every girl child of our country. Thank you Shoojit Sircar, Ritesh Shah, Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury for gifting such an amazing film for every 'Hindi Cinema Believers'."
"The best thing about this movie is that it is too real. It doesn't matter if you are a conservative or a liberal or a feminist, if you are human, you will like this. The social issues raised by this movie is on point and at the same time it is an entertaining watch. Movies like this shows the strength of Indian cinema to produce amazing films despite the extreme commercialization.Aniruddha roy chaudhary as the director have done a stupendous job. The first half of the movie has barely any dialogues and still the story is conveyed in a astounding and suspenseful way. The second half mainly focus on courtroom and I have not seen such intense court battle in a long time.Amitabh's acting is fantastic. Piyush Mishra is marvelous as always. The acting by the three girls is real and believable.Writing and dialogues by talented Ritesh Shah is one of the best I have seen.""Pink"" is intense, entertaining and honest. The issues raised by it really needs to be thought upon. It is a must watch for everyone."
"Shoojit and Aniruddha has delivered powerful punch on feudal mindset with engaging court room drama.Frame by frame excellence will bound you with your seat. Even you will not realize when movie reached to interval.Big B has refined himself as USP of movie. Taapsee has delivered stunning performance with fearsome dialogue delivery. Piyush Mishra was another performer. Kirti Kulhari,Andrea Tariang and Angad Bedi were good in supporting role. Script and dialogue were terrific and value addition to movie. Music is only section which need improvement. Although Kaari Kaari was delight to listen. Please stay in theater till the end credits for complete story. Let's paint it PINK. She said 'No' and 'No' means 'No'... based on this simple one word, director Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury raised some very relevant questions to our so called society through his exclusive film #PINK#. A gripping story, tight screenplay, sharp direction, excellent background score, perfect cinematography & brilliantly executed Court room Trials enriched PINK and make it more vibrant. The performances are pitch-perfect with Mr. Bachchan leading the way. He is Outstanding once again. Tapasee & Kirti Kulhari delivered power- packed performances. Angan Bedi is another one to watch out for those cold & brutal eyes. Gutsy congratulations to Soojit Sircar for making a contemporary youth-centric film with a strong socially relevant message. A Film That Everyone Needs to Watch. Make time for it."
"Pink addresses a prevalent societal issue extremely effectively. It is a very well made courtroom drama that is hugely thought provoking.The movie keeps viewer hooked from the very beginning, with a brief gory scene. Thereafter, the thrill just continues to build up and an intense drama sets up for an exciting, enriching second half. The movie is centered around three girls, and their fight for justice, respect, dignity, freedom and most importantly, CHOICE. The last 20 minutes are the most blunt, important and weighty; almost sum up the purpose of entire film. When a girl says NO, it simply means NO and doesn't necessarily have to come with a reason or explanation, whether she's a stranger, a friend, a girlfriend, a wife or a prostitute. Pink keeps coming harder at the viewer, telling and retelling that its not the size of a girl's skirt, or her (over)friendliness or her smoking/drinking/partying that enables you to decide/presume anything about her character. The director succeeds in bringing fore to the curtain what he likely intends to- the patriarchal dirt in our society as well as system, and the evil presumptions about urban world girl in more ways than one. The crisp camera-work, story and well-written dialogues make it seem genuinely realistic. The three girls portray their characters excellently. AB continues to add on to his list of amazing ventures, with another ace performance. Two other notable mentions are, the S.H.O. Madam and the Judge, who brilliantly occupy their respective screen spaces.Pink, as many of the wiser critics have said, is truly a landmark in Indian Cinema, and has a resounding message to deliver. It is a movie that runs well beyond just its run-time."
"I have always believed that the purpose of cinema is not just to entertain but also educate and empower the audience. The courtroom drama based movies are always engaging as the prosecutor and defendant both fight to solve the case with solid evidences and innumerable witnesses. Films like ""Damini"", ""Jolly LLB"",""Talvar"" or the recent ""Rustom"" has been immensely successful in keeping the audience engaged with impeccable dialogues and fantastic screenplay but what makes ""Pink"" different is the beautiful message on morality and equality of an independent woman when she is says ""NO"" to getting involved into any sexual preferences.""Pink"" tells the story of three independent girls in the city of Delhi who get involved in a crime in order to save themselves. Hell break lose when one of them, Meenal(played by Tapsee Pannu) file a harassment case against the Rajvir Singh(Angad Bedi), a nephew of a powerful minister. Little they know when their attackers turn their life miserable. Enter the scene, an old aged lawyer (played by Amitabh Bachchan), who wears anti-pollution mask every time he is on road, takes up the case to fight for justice.""Pink"" is one such hair-raising film which is definitely difficult to digest as it gives you goosebumps and eye-popping experience. The scene where Falak(played by Kirti Kulhari) calls her friend to compromise with the situation and immediately retaliate is jaw- dropping. The scene where Amitabh Bachchan asks Andrea (played by Andrea Tariang) where is she is from is a beautiful scene showing acceptance of her place in India. Couple of scenes in second half - interrogation scene between the female cop and Angad Bedi with Amitabh Bachchan in the court, the scene between Tapsee Pannu and Piyush Mishra is well-executed. A big clap for the director Aniruddha Roy for a fantastic characters details defined in 136 minutes. Screenplay is the hero with nail-biting moments. Art direction is fine while Cinematography is just about okay. Amitabh Bachchan is a knight in shining armour. Watch out for him in the second half when he questions the witnesses in the courtroom. It is unforgettable performance which should be lauded for its sheer brilliance. Among the actors - Tapsee Pannu and Kirti Kulhari is mindblowing with their natural performances. Angad Bedi does well as menacing character. Piyush Mishra, as usual, is powerful.On the whole, ""Pink"" is an experience that needs to be lauded for its impeccable direction, electrifying performances and beautiful message. Excellent 4/5Ketan Gupta"
"Pink, a brilliant film by Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury is going to shake you to the core. It is not a film from a feminist perspective, but it does talk about the shackles in which girls of our country are tied even in this century. Pink does raise many pertinent questions, talks of double standards, gender discrimination etc. In spite of females excelling in almost every field, there are many unsaid rules in our society which decides whether a female is of good character or not. The beauty of the film is that this is not at all a loud film in spite of conveying a very loud message. It talks of the attitudes prevalent all around us which stamps a female of 'questionable character' on the basis of the length of the her skirt, the time when she returns home after work, how much she smiles at men, whether she drinks / parties or not, and her virginity status etc. There are enough moral policing for girls. It also talks about the corrupt system in our country, the cops who actually need to protect people, end up in framing people in false cases. Pink through its highly engaging plot and courtroom drama turns out to be so powerful that it is bound to make you think. Three single independent working women Minal Arora (Taapsee Pannu), Falak Ali (Kirti Kulhari) and Andrea (Andrea Tariang) are friends and they share an apartment in Delhi. Minal is from Delhi itself, but due to her odd working hours, she stays with friends. Falak is from Lucknow and Andrea from Meghalaya. Their lives take a turn when they go for a rock concert with a friend Vishwa (Tushar Pandey) and befriend Rajveer (Angad Bedi) and Dumpy (Raashul Tandon). They accept a dinner invitation from Rajveer and go for the same in a resort in Surajkund, Haryana. After some light talks, jokes, drinks, Minal is inappropriately touched by Rajveer. In an effort for self- defense, Minal picks up a bottle and smashes it on Rajveer. The girls manage to escape from the resort. Till the credits roll, the incident is not shown which led to the whole plot. But the screenplay is so strong that one gets to have vivid visualization of what could have gone wrong. Girls do not approach the police initially out of fear. They even get more scared when they come to know that Rajveer is the nephew of very influential politician. Later, when all three are harassed by the boys gang (actor Vijay Varma also joins the gang) by different means, they decide to approach police department and file a case. But Rajveer files a case in turn against Minal mainly and accusing other two too. Minal is accused for 'Attempt to murder', for extorting money etc. All three of them are labeled in the FIR as prostitutes. Minal is arrested, and the case is handled by none other than Deepak Sehgal (Amitabh Bachchan), who lives in the neighbourhood of Minal, Falak and Andrea. The initial shots itself show Deepak doing morning exercises in the park, where he often ends up looking at Minal jogging with blank expressions. Deepak Sehgal had called it quits to his profession as a lawyer due to his bipolar disorder, but comes to the rescue of the girls. The second half is highly engaging with courtroom sequence. Piyush Mishra as Prashant is the prosecution lawyer. There we get to see some fine and smart moves during the debate. Deepak had answers to every accusation which Prashant was bringing up. Who wins in the end – Girls or the boys? How efficiently does Deepak suffering from bipolar disorder fight the case ? What defense statements were made by Prashant to protect the boys ? What was the motive of girls behind accepting dinner invitations from acquaintances, was it to extort money from the rich (as accused)? How were the girls Minal, Falak and Andrea treated in the society, workplace and in court after this incident ? How did they handle their character assassination? There are certain moments in the films which certainly would bring tears to your eyes. There is a scene, where after the incident, Minal is commented upon as the girl involved in 'Surajkund Kand', she just puts the hood of her sweatshirt on her head instead of retaliating, Amitabh Bachchan removes the hood. There are many more such moments. There is no lecture in the film; rather it talks about what is happening in and around us. There are some parts of the plot which were not very much justified: Amitabh Bachchan's Bipolar disorder, his ailing wife confined to a hospital bed. The boys appeared very influential and egoistic in the beginning, wanted to punish girls at any cost, but once when the courtroom drama started unfolding, there was not a single moment of encounter / threatening from these boys to girls, which seemed unlikely. But these are very much unnoticeable in midst of powerful scenes. Pink, a very powerful and outstanding film, conveys a message very loudly that when a woman (be it friend, acquaintance, wife) says 'No', it actually means 'No'. It also prompts society to stop judging a girl on the basis of length of her skirt, time of her returning home, her single status, her attempts to enjoy life in parties etc. The poem by Tanvir Ghazi recited by Amitabh Bachchan when the credits roll, clearly conveys that it is high time to end the patriarchal rules which shackles the women in stereotypes. Pink through its highly engaging plot and courtroom drama turns out to be so powerful that it is bound to shake you to the core."
"PINK is what everyone needs to watch and understand today. Not just India, the world needs to stop stereotyping and objectifying women.The movie starts off with three girls, scared and terrified by the incident that was about to change their lives. What happens next are the instances that take place everyday in our country with working women, college going girls, models and almost every urban girl. In a country where political influence can buy anyone, a women is treated as an object. They are judged by what they wear, whom they hang out with and where they work.The movie is backed by some powerful performances. Taapsee shines as Minal, she is brilliant as a modern, independent and brave woman who isn't shy from admitting publicly that she isn't a virgin. She puts up a brave act. Her friends played by Kirti Kulhari and Andrea Taring support her well and together they all are great. One cannot not praise Mr.Bachchan. He plays every character with finesse and this isn't an exception. His character raises several questions that we as a society should think on. Although initially I kind of hated him in the movie but as the movie goes on you realize how aptly his character was written. Everyone else (Angad Bedi, Piyush Mishra etc) does justice to their role.Director Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury does full justice to the story. He puts up a great show and gives us a reality check of our hypocritical society where women are judged every now and then. The background score is decent. Although the songs aren't great, they suit the story and go with the flow. The dialogues are great and the screenplay is brilliant. What I liked most about this movie is that it is relatable, it is what many women face today. There's nothing new about this movie because this is reality and everyone of us knows it but this has to be presented to change people's mind. And it is undoubtedly presented very well. I hope people watch this movie and realize that its time to change our society."
"Pink is an excellent movie. I am glad that such fine directors and movie makers still exist. All the actors including the ones who had very minimal screen presence made good impact with acting that looks effortless. India needs such a social message - to our educated 'uncles'&'aunties' and men and women who look down upon a woman and abuse her if she shows a streak of independence. It is time we respect our fellow beings as humans, and treat them equally. It is time we stop raising entitled children, especially boys who grow up to be grown up brats. When a person says 'No' to sex, it means 'No'. There is no justification for non consensual sex. A woman's choice of clothes, attitude, social status or personal habits (drinking, smoking) does not mean she is 'available'. People who cannot respect another person's boundaries and choose to commit such ferocious crimes should be treated like a criminal. Even sex workers have the right to say no, and not get raped."
"I don't remember the last I was this overwhelmed after watching a movie. Pink has done something that no other movie has managed to do. It has made me addicted to the movie. So much so that I didn't want to watch any other movie or read any book as I know nothing would be better than this. Truth of the matter, I didn't want to come out of this experience. Pink is the best movie of 2016 at-least so far!It engages and educates you. It challenges your thinking. It exposes the double standards. There is nothing that the movie doesn't touch as far as the gender stereotyping goes. Every dialogue of Amitabh's in the second half deserves applause. Great work by Ritesh Shah. There is one scene in second half where I wanted to stand and clap but was too shy to do it :P Yeah it was that good. Is there anything that Mr.Bachan cannot do?His baritone is one thing which is a great advantage but he can say a lot without speaking a single word. Very few actors manage to do it and Mr.Bachan stands tall in that list. All three girls were apt for their roles but it was kirti who excelled according to me.There was a standing ovation when the movie ended. Rightly deserved. I hope more ""pinks"" are made and until that's done, I am going to watch this movie as many times as I can as its been a while since any movie has filled my heart with joy and pride."
"Hi, I am complete taking about movie not about social massage and mentality of men and women.I like concept about this movie not add any Bollywood masala. Movie star with point. All actors and actress done very good work and Amitabh Bachchan did very good work.But when court case start and main part of movie there is lots of mistake or say there is many things are missing in script like land lord testimony, police inspector shaukeen when minal want to report of Intimidate. kidnap Minal Arora, phone conversations etc.How Deepak Sehga doing his investigation and collect thing there is no one his assistant, Partner and investigator.This movie depend only one thing which is about girls or women and what is the thinking of boy, men & society. Which is showing in this movie is good but not best."
"Often times, those who are nominated to positions of power and influence, bear a false sense of privilege that is misused and goes unchecked. In a city that is known exactly for a large number of such men, women tend to become the victims of misogyny and indignity. 'Pink' is a reflection of this deeply flawed society that even in today's times, instinctively falls back on stereotyping that is baseless. Director Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury's social drama truly becomes a thriller of sorts in its second half when the trial exposes not just the victims and perpetrators but also the society which plays a huge role in determining who the guilty are. When a casual night out after a rock concert ends up with a bottle smashed into the face of a minister's nephew, the girls who were simply defending themselves from physical molesters have drawn curtains on a wild party life. Constantly in a state of nervous silence and anxious worry, their daily routines soon get affected by threats from the men who seek vengeance for the grave injury to their beloved friend. Minal Arora (Tapsee Pannu), in an impulsive act of rage and self-defense, smashed a bottle onto Rajveer Singh (Angad Bedi) who crossed the lines of decency when they were at a party. Unfortunately for Minal and her friends, Falak (Kirti Kulhari) and Andrea (Andrea Tariang), Rajveer happens to be the nephew of a powerful South Delhi politician. A series of harassment attempts affect their landlord, their workplace and even their casual coffee outings. Thus, even the FIR complaint against the harassment by Rajveer and his accomplices falls on deaf ears at the Police station and soon enough, a counter complaint gets Minal arrested for attempted murder. These proceedings are keenly observed by one of the neighbors where the girls live and seeing the injustice, offers to take their case even though he had retired as a renowned lawyer due to his mental illness. Deepak Sehgal (Amitabh Bachchan) maybe old and weak but he knows the law better than most and with his more measured approach, he combats Prashant Mehra (Piyush Mishra), the prosecutor whose loud and boisterous accusations reflect the society's flawed mentality and baseless stereotyping. Mehra represents the bigotry of the orthodox Indian society that downplays the role of women and their rightful positions while questioning every action with a perverse and sick assumption. His loud and overpowering arguments are the embarrassing reality of the way many men think of women even in these times in an evolving society. In stark contrast, Deepak Sehgal tries to evaluate how low the society has fallen to mistreat and misjudge 3 innocent women who were victims of the power-hungry perpetrators. Can he help deliver unbiased justice to the girls while challenging the irregularities of society's stigma and prejudices? Pink hits the value system hard and the director keeps the viewer engaged with twists and revelations that keep the verdict hanging till the very end. Tapsee Pannu and Kirti Kulhari deliver riveting performances as they struggle through their altered realities. Tapsee mumbles her responses as a witness in the box but she portrays her shaken self quite convincingly. Falak is targeted by Mehra's accusations of prostitution and eventually, deviates from the planned defensive lines. Kirti's performance here is gut wrenching and her plight is understandable. Prashant Mehra's aggressive prosecution allows Piyush Mishra to thrive on his excellent dialogue delivery. He matches up to Amitabh Bachchan's commanding presence with his performance, thus charging the scene up for audiences to enjoy. As an aging Deepak Sehgal, Bachchan's portrayal of an acclaimed lawyer is powerful not only with his sheer presence and calculated dialogue delivery, but also the conviction with which he fervently supports the girls. The closing statement by Amitabh Bachchan is among his finest performances in recent times that also highlights the film's underlying theme. It's effect is moving and necessary to shake up the hypocrisy in a flawed society. However, while Mr. Sehgal's decision to fight for the girls comes as celebratory news in the plot line, there's hardly any communication among them in preparation for each hearing. That's precisely where we would've had a better understanding of why they behaved as they did in court. It still provides for riveting courtroom drama but for the kind of overall realism depicted by Chowdhury, this seems like a fundamental interaction that's almost omitted. Director Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury keeps the accusations louder than the defense and with good reason. The hypocrisy and outdated mentality resonate through the general population and in some cases, out of guilt of being a part of it. Pink is a very important film for today's times and as an influence for the future generations. It depicts the darker reality that we live with but choose to ignore it as it may not affect us directly. It demands a change in the way we think of women, a basic change in mentality that is needed to raise society as a whole and treat each other with respect and draw strict lines when it comes to individuality. 8.955 on a scale of 1-10."
"I liked the way the story was portrayed with an important and strong message sent across by none other than the great Amitabh bachchan in the movie. The plot of this movie is very realistic with the possibility of the court case going either way until the verdict is given. Although, the highlight of the movie has been Amitabh's exceptional acting, Taapsee Pannu has also done a commendable job as the victim.I was saddened to see the theater almost empty as I thought this is a must watch movie for everyone in this era to understand the message that the movie makers are trying to convey.Kudos to the Pink team for coming up with phenomenal movie."
Amidst all the commercial box office Bollywood movies Pink is like a breath of fresh air which shows the trouble faced by three middle class working once they decide to fight against the patriarchal society of our country. The trouble they face when one incident throws there life in a downward spiral and how they overcome it is the basis of pink . With minimum spice and maximum focus on story this movie is successful in keeping the audience on there seats from the starting credits to the ending credits and top notch acting from all the cast members gives a great experience which makes you think something like this can even happen to any girl in today's society.Leave aside the critical mind and try to enjoy this movie and think what should we learn from it. In the end this is must for every guy so that we can learn how to make a better environment for the girls and never forget a NO ALWAYS MEANS A NO!!!
"This movie had ""Bachchan"" written all over it. The movie is very much watchable with a very good story, power-packed acting by Bachchan, Tapsee Pannu and Kirti Kulhari, brilliant background score and capitalizing on AB's voice. Some key flaws were overshadowed by the strengths, though.Story (8/10): Pink is about something which has been said time and again about when a girl says ""NO"", it means ""NO"" and nothing else (I hope I don't need to mention the context here!). Ironically, a contrary of this is what Bollywood movies reiterated in the 80s and 90s through cheap songs. Three girls from a modest background trying to fight not just a bunch of misguided and politically powerful boys who tried to violated their modesty but also the society that often discourages them from doing the right thing, let alone support them. The plot is not at all new but the story had pretty new elements that showed that a girl's background, habits, clothes or even ""occupation"" has nothing to do or justify any kind of crime that happens to her. The story was powerful, flow was good enough. However, one major flaw was the projection of antagonists which was very weak - something that takes the sheen away from protagonists as well. With the kind of reputation Ritesh Shah carries - with Airlift, CityLights, and Kahaani in his pocket - it didn't elevate.Acting (9/10): Besides the obvious - Bachchan - two actors to watch out for was Tapsee Pannu and Kirti Kulhari who gave brilliant performances. Their expressions and dialog delivery was really good. No major names in the rest of the cast. The movie was largely shouldered by Amitabh Bachchan. I am simply amazed at how this legend continues to do this year after years and there is no stopping - in fact, he elevates it every single time. However, there was a drought on the antagonists' side where there were no major names to call for. Villains aren't intimidating enough, except for the inexplicable rage attacks (if I may say so). I would have loved to see someone like KK Menon there. Great antagonists make great courtroom drama as well - be it in Kanoon, Waqt, Damini or OMG.Direction (9/10): In his Hindi directorial debut, Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury was impressive. The flow of the movie was just right and never felt it was losing audience attention. What I loved was the way he projected different perceptions prevailing in the current society regarding crimes against women in a very subtle manner. In that process, he also portrays certain ironies where women themselves are involved in suppressing any voice raised against such crimes. He also touched upon the issue of discrimination against the people of North East - in general, and especially girls. However, he capitalized heavily on Amitabh Bachchan's voice and relied largely on him to bring this movie to success.Overall (9/10): I loved it, even though I have seen better. For Amitabh fans, which practically the entire country, this movie is a treat. But remove him, hypothetically, and I doubt if this movie would have made such a huge impact."
"A brilliant film! Salute to the director's and writer's conviction and message. The typical mindset that is prevalent that if a woman goes to a party and drinks or jokes with a guy ...she will be willing for sex. The stigma that every male chauvinist has been harboring has to change. A woman has the freedom to laugh or drink, wear whatever she likes or attend parties. That doesn't give any man the right to presume that she is a slut or she is ready to sleep with anyone. And that change is only possible when every mother educates her son to respect women and learn to accept NO for an answer. I seriously wish more writers & directors come up with such brilliant messages that can be an eye opener to all communities who look down upon women for being bold. Amitabh Bachchan's stupendous performance and the opposing lawyer kept me to the edge of my seat. The 3 actresses were par excellent, However Kirti kulhari's acting impressed me!She is the next Shabana Azmi! Wonderful concept..gripping!Deserves accolades and definitely awards! A MUST SEE FOR EVERYONE!#pink2016 #AniruddhaRoyChowdhury #Riteshshah #AmitabhBachchan"
"Entire star caste did well.Film is must watch for standard audience,how gals r always targeted if they behaves like boys.Film shows mirror to narrow mindedness to Indian society who thinks that for rape, molestation gals r responsible n not boys. Amitabh's character points Gal's manual in numbers are a tight slap for such people. how police does moral policing n how the society thinks biased of bachelor gals living alone.This is the first film which appeals people to not to consider north-eastern gals as characterless.Film grips the audience till the end of the titles till last second and at the ending the poem of Tanveer Ghazi sung by Amitabh is very motivating and holds audience at their seats. All 3 gals did well in looks, acting. 3 gals shown of 3 different religions Christian, Hindu, Muslim but staying with a nice harmony n normal career oriented,aspiring gals.The cross checking of witnesses with some satirical jokes by Amitabh gets lot of claps. Amitabh proved that he is not only a great actor but a good singer. Shoojit sircar once again shown his talent.This movie meant for standard audience n not for typical movie goers n thriller can be feel in cinema halls only.Film is successful in giving full respect to woman's veto for taking her as an sex object."
"Yet another feminist movie which shows it is the men who are always wrong and quick to judge and women are always right. Although, it does raises some really good agendas like the catchphrase from the movie ""No means no, it doesn't matter who she is whether she is a sex worker, your girlfriend, close friend or even your wife. You are not suppose to force her and the most of all not to judge a women's character even if she drinks, do drugs, wear short clothes or comes late at home just like how you won't judge a man if he does the same things or at least that is what the movie is trying to say"", but correct me if I am wrong since when doing all of those horrendous things have become completely fine regardless of any gender? Sure, today teens treat this like some kind of fashion, if you are not doing it like the others you are definitely not the coolest kid in the neighborhood, but the movie never picks any of these themes instead finding every reason to blame it all on men. This movie is just so biased on one side only! -This ""Movie"" do teach us a great lesson that men should not judge women, this is not 19th-20th century anymore, but what about women when they judge men? and specially those who abuse Anti-Dowry and Anti- Rape laws to the extreme? In 2013, 1,00,000 cases were filed and out of them 20,000 cases were faked and ruined a lot of families and they are still in jail for a crime they have never even commit, but these issues will never be raised because we are living in a corrupted society where one word from a woman can judge the whole life of a man, but feminist will eat you alive if you ever made a petty judgment out of joke too. This movie would have been much better if only they had picked one male protagonist and one female protagonist both who are constantly struggling in a society regarding their own gender related issues because not a lot of people acknowledges this fact that sexism is a common enemy of both men and women. Hopefully, one day there will be a movie that realizes these problems and another big celebrity like Big B becomes the support of that guy in the movie to raise the cause."
"Went to see this movie after seeing Ravish Kumar of NDTV singing praises for it. He did it probably because NDTV loves to glorify anything and everything mediocre by Bengalis. This movie included.This movie successfully looks and sounds highly intellectual and intelligent and people have bought it, even when its none. Very high on rhetoric and this movie actually delivers nothing. If you go to the movie without reading a review, you will not be able to understand the first half.Overacting by all, including Sr Bachchan, is extremely annoying. However Angad Bedi looks a good actor in the character of Rajveer Singh.Highly disappointed by this movie. Its totally over the top and outlandish. Its always men who are at fault. Women/girls are always right. This movie tells this. Ha ha, which world are you guys living in? Conclusion: Not recommended by me. Even if I am alone on that. I have completely lost faith in 'presstitutes' finally."
"Pink (2016) ""No. No, your honor. 'No' is not a word. It is a complete sentence. It doesn't need any further explanation. 'No' simply means 'no'. My client said no', your honor and these boys must realize that 'no' means 'no' whether the girl is an acquaintance, a friend, girlfriend, or a sex worker. Or even your own wife! 'No' means no'! I want someone says so, you stop."" The Good: 
* Makes important statements regarding social issues includes consent, double standards for females and males, inherent biases, molestation, misogyny, rape, self defense, social strata, and violence against women. This is especially relevant in India, where rapes often go unreported for to fear of public shame and possibly (as portrayed in the film) having it backfire. It is still frowned upon by some for a girl to be independent, outspoken, willful, or to drink or go anywhere in private with a male. 
* Amitabh Bachchan, due to his seniority, was originally first listed in the credits. However, to show gender equality, he requested to have his name listed after the three leading ladies. It is great to know that the actor was as passionate about gender quality as his character was in the film. 
* A clever creative choice was showing the scene of what actually happened that night, in slow motion, during the credits. Be sure to wait for that. The Bad: 
* Great acting overall by the three leading ladies, but they were quite melodramatic. It alternated between an impressive performance and a performance completely overdone. 
* Bachchan may have had a powerful presence, but he was also creepy. Whatever the reasons, his breathing mask, combined with his mysterious demeanor and harsh voice, made for more of a creepy presence. Add to that the angles that made his eyes look white in many scenes, he was straight up scary. Supposedly he had bipolar, but I do not even know why that was a detail. The Ugly: 
* Unrealistic portrayal of a court debate. These lawyers would not be a allowed to intimidate and yell at the witnesses on the stand, practically coercing them into a false confession. Likewise, they would not be allowed to preach on topics irrelevant to the case. The case becomes a stage for feminism, narrated by Bachchan. 
* Makes important points, but crosses the line very early on into preaching. To the point that I might call this propaganda. 
* Unrealistic to the point that I could not take it seriously and became bored in the second hour of this unnecessarily long film. Conclusion: Many memorable lines, overall good performances,, made a valuable case for many important social issues; but excessive in length, portrayed court cases unrealistically, and it became preaching (practically) propaganda."
"This is not a film that espouses any moral values like good character, not fornicating before marriage, avoiding alcohol or being a woman/man of dignified conduct / honourable character.
The three young women in this film live as roommates,work,date,fornicate,imbibe alcohol,party without dignity & go out roaming with shady characters to remote locations , at suspicious hours.This film is solely about one thing - Consent.While it's a sorry state of affairs that Indians think that they are entitled to act in immoral ways ( in their personal lives ) in the name of being 'modern' or have a bar set so low, that merely being 'consensual adults' is pass marks for any activity - this still is a very important film for this country - esp. the Hindi belt in North India ( considering the patriarchal mindset that a woman's consent means nothing or that if she is of questionable character / wears cheap western clothes / partakes of alcohol / is overfriendly - "" she's asking for it "" or "" needs to be taught a lesson ."" )Amitabh Bachchan doesn't dissapoint.Considering how many women are victimized in India , this film should be part of the curriculum in boys schools / panchayats / police training academies & law colleges ( for the future lawyers who defend rapists , by attacking the victim's character. )"
"Dnt go by reviews. Movie is slower than a snail's pace. There's nothing new in the concept, we all know about it since we are born.Actual story is just 10 mins which is stretched too far into a 2 hour movie. The people who are rating it high is because of their egos attached with issues like size of clothes, fighting their mom dads to go to pubs etc, grow up people, these concepts were there in 70s 80s movie as well and v clearly depicted, is such a cliché concept ! Movie seems to make a point in favour of regular pub visiting women going around with boys day in and out. Its not a health execution of a good concept. It will clearly make lives of moms and dads more tough making their kids understand whats wrongs and whats right as there is a difference between legal and moral life. Boys should avoid girls as in India laws are 10 times more against them. Earlier, there was castisim and reservation in jobs for 60 years, now this sexism. Its just a means to exploit masses emotions and using for meeting own selfish needs of making money and rising in politics. It wnt be surprising to see Amitabh or movies director a part of Indian political drama after few years."
"No wonder this story is fictional and no wonder this story has no resemblance to any person living or dead. Just like modern feminism, the movie PINK seems to take actual facts, logic and throws them in a garbage. The movie then proceeds to shove down the throats of its viewers mindless facts about how girls are the real victims of this society. Somehow NO means NO but only when its applied to the female gender.The story revolves around 3 girls who go on a night out using their female privileges to enjoy free booze and the company of men, but at the same time withholding the view that they are pious women that need some respect. Throughout the whole night, the 3 girls had no issue whatsoever in enjoying all the privileges of being the girlfriend of 3 rich guys, namely free booze, free transport and free house to chill.Movie tries to shock the views by making Amithab question the character / virginity of a girl in court. The truth is, the fact that Indian cinema needs to show this scene to redpill the females of India shows how much illiterate they are in India. PINK also wastes 3 hours trying to prove if 3 girls are prostitutes or just victims when he real issue here is why was there a need to resort to violence? We live in a society where its when women are abusive / violent, its a mark of bravery However if the same traits are found in men, then they become rapists! PINK misleads viewers into thinking that women's tears actually hold more value than a plethora of evidence provided by the prosecution. After enjoying all those freebies solely based on their female privileges, somehow its now that these three teens find out that the guys were not actually gentlemen but it was just a one night stand. Its as if these 3 girls who all this time have been enjoying all the privileges of being a girlfriend in 2016 now has taken a time travel machine has has gone back to 1940 where one night stand does not exists. Suddenly after enjoying all these free booze and entertainment, those 3 women turned out to be 3 very pious women who just was at the wrong place at the wrong time.One question that must be asked to all those so called modern women of India and around the world reading this review. When you get invited by a guy at a restaurant, you automatically assume there will be food. When you get invited by a guy for Cinema, you automatically assume you will watch a movie together. Yet somehow, when girls are invited buy guys at their homes in the middle of the night, most girls seem to put on their innocent girl and rape victim cape on and act surprised that somehow a guy who just invited a girl to his house just want to have some sex."
"Let me start off by saying that the movie was entertaining with some good performances.But I felt the plot was unconvincing and at times outlandish and over the top especially the court scenes and the second half,which is like a moral science lecture on consent and woman's choice.The first half is decent with its moments and gets the mood right but its the second half that's a let down.Amitabh Bachchan is great as the defence lawyer but his counterpart played by Piyush Mishra is a huge let down.His character was clichéd to the point that anything he says in the movie is outlandish and moronic.So are the villains who are reduced to dummies with feudal/patriarchal issues.The plot was used to advance a single point : Consent! The court drama was high on rhetoric,low on intelligent arguments and a lack of engaging back and forth between the defence and the prosecution completely undermines the second half and with it the movie too.By reducing the opposition to a caricature the movie conveniently concludes with Amitabh doing the rescuing act with nauseating lecturing and with the whole consent thing.This movie is a example of creating a plot with an end product already in mind.The story is a poor excuse for the whole ""shoving consent down ur throat"" monologue that repeats throughout the second half.The dialogue was very in ur face,harsh and at times out right unbearable.The movie uses the brute realities of our patriarchy and shamelessly reproduces it without any filter and in the process makes u cringe and convulse to drive home its point.This I think is easy only if you are out to please the average viewer,but to engage an intelligent audience you need a convincing plot,intelligent characters and engaging drama!!I wanted to like this movie but it disappointed me on so many levels that i simply cant bring myself to appreciate a good intention but half-baked execution.Pink is an Assault on the Senses!!"
"The trailer of the movie got me interested. The way they jumbled up the events, really puzzled me and made me see this movie. Movie itself was rather straightforward.The plot involves an ordeal of 3 independent modern age, working girls getting accused in a case of assault with wealthy, influential and thus egoistic boys. Crowd gives it judgement based on their age-old mentality and girls are shamed. Finally Mr. AB(a retired lawyer) takes the job of saving his and the girls' honor in his hands. Amitabh Bacchan gives a solid performance in the role of a slowly degenerating lawyer. His dialogue delivery is strong with small bits of intelligence(though that is expected out of a lawyer). He single-handedly keeps the audience feel that something important is being shown and they should pay attention.The premise of the movie for me is lacking in strength. Also how the courtroom case unfolds rarely gives it a tense feeling of case being the balance and makes us think about the next move of lawyers. The arguments by both (girls' and boys') sides are very flat and very predictable. The sharp edge is clearly missing. The courtroom movies have always been very engaging and thought provoking, but not this one.I must admit the role of the protagonist girl was a very challenging one, and very important at the same time. It couldn't have been overlooked cause the whole movie stands on it. There clearly the movie lacks depth. Taapsee Paanu comes flat with rare moments of poignancy. This role could have easily given to someone more artistic for the lack of a better word.Other two girls show signs of talent but again appear like caricatures. I liked the work of Kirti Kulhari , she has given a lot of energy to it. But again disappointed by lack of depth and soul shown by her.Still I think this movie has a lot of positives, specially the message it wants to convey. There are lot of men out there who treat women badly and label them just by what they wear and what they do. The movie tries to break those stereotypes by stereo- typing men which is an easy way-out. I think given the current wave of feminism(and pseudo-feminism) this movie will open lot of discussions and also encourage the movie-makers to start making cinema for the here and the now. It's a brave attempt and many more movies like this are about to come ."
"Not a movie but a lesson to uneducated Haryana boys(Haryana is a state, a province, in India).This is not something for movie lovers or in general not something for art lovers.India is a country where policing is done through movies, today all the movies shows anti smoking and anti drinking statutory warning. It is an established fact in India that majority in this country are dumb and copy what they see in movies. For such crowd in context of how to treat a women, yes this movie is a good lesson.This is just a bore for any educated human being. Education as in Life education, not the degree certificate that north Indian boys buy in market!"
"these were one of the worst 2:16 Hours of my life, i wonder who rated this movie with such high score, probably girls who support the No means No slogan, but again there is much better ways to present that thought other than very naive and amateur script with boring cast, dull reactions and 0 intensity, like you know from the beginning what is going to happen, 0 attachment for the characters, 0 logic, 0 everything, i almost fell a sleep 3 times during watching this movie, i hope some people can read my review and save themselves a 2:16 Hours of their time, i wish someone did the same for me before watching this movie."
"This is a courtroom drama which can at best be described as a waste of your time. It touches on an aspect of life in India that we are very well aware of - that women in India should not hang out with guys they do not know in unknown places after dark. A good part of this movie is spent in silence, with Amitabh thinking because of his bipolar (?) disorder. There are some attempts at tear-jerk moments where stereotypes of women are portrayed.This is recommended for those with: 1. A strong love of Amitabh Bacchhan - He does a terrific job in portraying the persona of a retired lawyer, supposedly with bipolar disorder. 2. Those who love one-sided courtroom dramas - Think of something of a movie made just from the courtroom scenes of 'Damini' 3. Those with a strong feminist streak who feel that their emotions need to be let out in the form of a courtroom drama where you can empathize with the characters.Not recommended for: 1. Anyone else."
"Rarely come in Bollywood films that provoke you, reignite a topic of grave importance, unleash fury in you so much that it stays with him or her for a long time. One such film is ""Pink"", a highly engrossing courtroom crime drama by Bengali filmmaker Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury.Minal (Tapsee Pannu), Falak (Kirti Kulhari), and Andrea (Andrea Tariang) are three independent working women who live alone in a rented apartment in the capital city of India. Following a night of drunken brawl with some men they met at a rock concert, the trio come back home in a state of exponential disquietude. What really happened towards the end of the night at a hotel where the trio and the men met and further partied post the concert is not clear, save for one immediate consequence: one of the men had to be rushed to the hospital. What follows is a harrowing story about a study on assumptions that society as a whole makes on people, especially women. Hence, one guesses, the title, ""Pink"".The film does not describe what really happened that night, and one has to wait for the second half to get some deep insights into the matter as the scene shifts to a Sessions Court where Deepak (Amitabh Bachchan), a reputed lawyer, comes out of retirement to enable the female trio a chance at vindicating themselves after they were picked up by the police for crimes that they say they didn't do. One can connect the dots here, but that is where one will go wrong as the story gathers pace and proves you wrong. The plot will have you flummoxed for it does not take side as to who - the unruly group of four men or the trio of liberal and rebellious fashionista women - are at fault. What could have been averted with just an apology blows out of proportion when the male group use the hand of politics that is resting on their shoulders to settle scores with the female group who also are not fully of one mind about a possible compromise. It goes to show that today's youth - or let me be more general - today's people, practice vendetta more than pacifism, and the blame is on feudalism, which has mutated itself to an ultra-strong force that produces madness in today's world. One will be impressed and hooked with the narrative in 30 minutes, guaranteed. While police apathy is one theme it touches upon, Pink is largely about what today's society, with its feudal roots, assumes when a woman consumes alcohol, when she hangs out with her male friends, when she keeps a casual relationship with that widower, when she has casual sex with that librarian she met while discussing Franz Kafka's ""The Trial"", or when she wears that transparent-lace brassiere - the possibilities are endless. It focuses on the futile point that a woman's (or a man's) character is defined by their behavior, their demeanor, their air at a given point of time and at a given location. It strains to enlighten us with the fact that this assumption is rubbish and full of void. It narrates the assumptions in strong points, delivered, some as innuendos ad others as clearly as text written on iron, by the talented Piyush Mishra as solicitor defending the male group. It also has a lot to say about the discrimination of Indians against their own brothers and sisters who hail from the Northeast, a topic which was most recently reignited by a TV commercial. The courtroom sequences are well-edited, but are slightly cheesy if not fast-paced for an audience whose senses have been numbed by the likes of Great Grand Masti (2016) and Freaky Ali (2016). A much- needed jolt to their senses, this film embraces realism wherever required and furnishes a story that is divinely appropriate and fabulously timed, just to convey an important message: that when a woman says NO, it means NO.The three actresses are marvelous and well-directed. There's not a single frame where they go out of character, helping the story to reveal itself using their own portrayals as windows of loud expressions. Sometimes, the most difficult characters to play are the ones that are so close to real life. Amitabh Bachchan again comes up and impresses his audience, hat-tricking his bout of roles that are aligned in the same column of crime thrillers. Mishra and supporting cast are very good, and happy to see Dhritiman Chatterjee. The film works partially because of the cast and their performance, along with some crisp writing, easy screenplay, and a subtle, but loud score.The 150-minute drama does, of course, have its share of flaws, but not substantial enough to affect your viewing or enjoyment. The courtroom scenes don't always sample realism, but that can be forgiven as a cinematic liberty taken by Mr. Chowdhury and writer Ritesh Shah. The hand of political influence which the male group were banking on fails to advance inside the court as is not what usually happens, either in real or reel life. But, one doesn't have time to pinpoint these petty flaws in the film because he or she also wants to assume that the women are not guilty or that the men are not guilty; this way, even the plot tries to play with you, making you believe in smoke and mirrors.It partially reminds one of Quentin Tarantino's debut, Reservoir Dogs (1992), where the actual scene of the heist is never shown. Here, the actual scene is not clearly shown unless you are patient enough. So, don't miss the end credit roll.BOTTOM LINE: Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury's debut Bollywood feature ""Pink"" is gritty, relevant, and a well-executed film that demands immediate viewing for it will be quoted in numerous occasions as we leap forward with a backward mind. Book a theater ticket now!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES"
"I don't know why the movie is getting such good reviews. The reality is that the movie actually is a sadist. I am not allowed to write any spoiler here, but the best thing about the movie is there isn't any spoiler. This should not be even included in the thriller genre. A movie is a thriller when the unexpected happens. Or when the director plays with your imagination and you are wrong. Something else happens. Thats not the case here. The movie is pathetically slow. Too much repetitive. It has been prolonged way too much just to meet the Bollywood standards maybe. If someone is feeling happy and wants to feel how does depression feel, this is the movie to watch. The 3 girls, throughout the movie just cry cry and cry. Various possible alternatives have not even been considered, just to show the plight of girls. This isn't a spoiler, just a general observation. When police ill-treats one of your friends, then u always have the option of going to media and stop such ill-treatment. But no, director is too much melodramatic. please don't consider watching this movie. Yes, the movie has a strong moral and message at the end, but that moral could have been presented in a much better way rather than being so much over dramatic. No doubt, Amitabh Bacchan rocks like always"
"Pink = Great concept & motto (agree with -> must watch for Indian Youth theory but please judge a movie on the merits of a movie not on it being a social justice charity advert or something), not romcom (no karan johar material, that's why didn't last in cinemas long), serious cinema, good script except at few points in court room where rational deduction leading to a point/theory was missing, but acting, dialogues and creative justice was missing, tried to be too intellectual but fails miserably, dragged, many scenes of Amitabh and his emotion less, reaction less silence etc when a reaction to events/environment around was expected, were totally dragging and point less. Acting from new talent was impressive though. Villain looks and sounds the part. supporting actors also do well. Lady SHO was 100% genuine types. Movie heavily biased towards girls' theory/story just because 99.99% times girls are innocent victims, only difference is, in this story they were not that innocent, they led the guys to a situation/impression where outcome was obvious (having drinks with strangers, going to their farmhouse rooms in night, having more drinks there and sharing non- veg jokes - all will raise hopes of a one night stand even in western part of world - isn't that what Bridget Jones did and wanted in our favorite Bridget Jones' baby movie😳 ), no rape happened or anything, just an indecent proposal (only because girl wasn't in mood, same proposals lead to one night stand if girl is in same mood) leading to some physical push backs from girl involving a serious physical injury to the guy. That's it. Later on the guy was judged based more on his own feudal thinking, MLA connections and arrogance than on the merits of the court case & evidence which is irrational & doesn't usually happen in western courts/dramas. In Summary, movie lacks strong acting, creative justice, logic, cinematography and supports wrong type of girls for a just cause (which is sexual harassment of decent girls/women in India because of perceptions around some of them that they are easy catch just because they wear modern stuff or are friendly with guys). That's my verdict."
"Great message, Great acting, Great character casting and Great direction. But for the people who don't have feudal thoughts, there's ""NO""thing new or exciting in this script. First half specifically is very slow and the build up takes time. As earlier said, it serves a strong message in a right way and that's what the best part of the movie is. Tapsee Pannu strikes the role almost perfectly and is certainly the best takeaway from this movie.Storyline Rating: 3 Content: 3 Commercialization: 2 Entertainment: 3Acting Rating: 3 Tapsee Pannu: 4 Amitabh Bachchan: 3 Kirti Kulhari: 3 Piyush Mishra: 2Direction Rating: 3Music Rating: 2Cinematography: 3Editing: 3"
"This movie really explains, what is wrong with our society and where the actual problem is. Whole story is elaborated so nicely, I very much felt frustration against people like those, that I see all the time. Putting restrictions on girls and judging them by their dress has always been common in our country. I here quote a dialogue: ""Drinking is bad character for girls but only a health hazard for boys"".Everyone did a really great job. Story is kept simple and close to real. The facts presented by movie are very straight forward and make you think, what fact or logic some perverts don't understand. Really provoking and is a must watch movie!!"
"PINK is by far one of the most brilliant films I have watched. Not just it is excellently made but also makes an important point. ""No Means No.""This thriller drama starts with a very smart story telling move without actually showing the incident and what proceeds is dark thriller and a riveting court room drama.PINK deals with the prejudices, patriarchy and misogyny that is a part of our daily society, how we label the women who chose to live their life in the way they want. Coming back to the film the writing is top notch and full marks to the writer for the amazing screenplay which not for a single moment loses its grip. Director Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury & Shoojit Sircar has created a master piece and should be lauded for his work here. Talking about performances by three ladies Tapasee, Kirti Kulhari, & Andrea is realistic and believable, you can see and feel the pain and shock they have been through. Angad Bedi as Rajveer is amazing. Amitabh Bachchan as a bipolar lawyer is truly brilliant and one of my favorite performance by theactor. Apart from the lead Dhritiman Chatterjee & Piyush Mishra have also delivered a praiseworthy performance.The courtroom drama is surely to make to cringe and uncomfortable. The best part is the Climax. And full marks to the Director and writer for ending the film in way which leaves you speechless and questioning the very morality of this society.PINK is Indian Cinemas one of the most important film.Also want to say in the end ""No means NO."""
"PINK - How can i force a person to watch a movie , just with the help of my writing. Don't know weather my words are so strong or not. But i have to try , otherwise my whole review writing hobby will be a waste. As one of my friend(NKP in short) described , this movie puts you in a dilemma. On one side we care for girls in our family , so we put restrictions on them which in some way we think is right for their safety, but On the other hand we also should give them a free will to do whatever they want to do in their life , as a boy does in his life. The movie came as a good lesson as well as a message for being cautious.Its such a hard decision to take , and such a thin boundary to cross. This movie makes me feeling shameful that i live in a society where judgment on the character of a women and a men are given on such drastically distinct grounds. Why a girl who try to be friendly with boys , or drinks with them or even hold their hands casually or put their hand on any boys' shoulder is considered as a girl who is trying to go to bed with that particular boy. Its insane to think like that , but unfortunately it happens. We often encounter conversations when a girl is considered of bad character because she has too many male friends or she drinks or even she uses curse words, but same benchmarks doesn't apply to boys. I seriously don't know what to write about this film , because the content in the movie is even itself to big to write a review on , the perfect way in which the movie is being made is just the extra benefit. The movie has been made in a grounded way. In a way you could relate it to. Like it could happen to any girl , in any city of India. Same goes for the courtroom drama. It is represented in a way as realistic as it can be. Its also a difficult movie to watch , which also make it important to watch. There were too many scene when your heart will make you cry for the helplessness of the victims in the movie. Dialogues were strong , and the way they were imposed in the courtroom was even stronger. Each time the lawyer against the victim ask them some question on their character , we can she they mumble in replying , how weak they were feeling at that time. The way Amitabh's character counts the precautionary measures which a girl should take so that she might not by default show some bad indication to the boy was brilliant. Done with sarcasm but brilliant. Also close to end how Amitabh describe how strong the word ""NO"" is. When a women says it doesn't matter if she is a housewife or a sex worker , no one can force her for anything. All these statements couldn't have been better then came out of Amitabh's mouth. Did i have to say that he was brilliant. Its great to see how even in this age of his carrier he can enter into the character so brilliantly that we only see the character but not the actor. It was his dream to play a lawyer in a film , this movie pays him that chance. Tapsee Pannu shines brilliantly in this character as center of attraction. This movie shows she could used in better roles in Bollywood then she has been before. Same goes for Kirti Kulhari (whom i liked in SHAITAN but she didn't get much work after that). Andrea Tarian didn't have much to do , but she never faulted. All other actors did great job. SHANTANU MOITRA's background score was superbly engaging to excite you as well as make you feel emotional as per the situation . There were some issues with editing. Some court room scenes ended unfinished , but that's just too critical to point out and i am not complaining at all. Its one of the best movie ever made. Certainly the best this year surpassing UDTA PUNJAB , NEERJA and KAPOOR & SONS . Its as good as a movie can be. No flows to detect altogether. I am sensing National Award here. I am overwhelmed and hurt at the same time . Thats the effect movie made on me. Don't know what else to say. 10/10 If this rating of mine cant force you watch it , then i don't know what else can. by ANuP APu KuMaR."
"I had been waiting to see this film for two days and when we did book tickets at Metro - Big Cinema, I knew film would be bold going by the trailer, though I normally resist any introduction to a film before actually seeing the film. And yes, no reviews for me. I personally prefer to see the movie with an unbiased mind..I am not a cinema critic nor a film writer, not in the true sense ! Pink heralds a new hope.. it awakens a new think link in our mind.. we need to look up to the facts and figures without any pride and/or prejudice.. we need to really preach things we practice.. we need to assure the equality of behavior for our girls as much as for our boys..Pink has outscored over my expectations - it has erupted a new sense of thinking within our minds..A new think link.. one should not presume things about the behaviour of others and not before knowing fully well of consequences..A No is a No ..It is difficult to pick the brightest part of the film.. every character or part is done to perfection.. yet if I were to pick just few likes from so many ways the movie has proved to be good.. here I I go Tapasee Pannu in my opinion has delivered beyond imagination..Amitabh Bachchan in spite of so many other good enactments by him in past has once again reminded us there is still so much fire left within him to power a blockbuster all on his own..I do not know who has composed the poem towards end.. it is absolutely amazing and holds you in the theatre till the end..If it were possible to rate a movie beyond 10 out of 10 .. Pink falls in that category.."
"Pink: She is on the Warpath!Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury's 'Pink' is a must watch to know what actually a 'No' means because a 'No' is not just a word; it means a choice, right, and decision of a woman to execute her feeling she is going through then and there. And we men need to learn to respect their choice and right to say 'No' and that a single woman, a friendly girl, or a woman who shares a drink doesn't mean that she is available. Pink unrolls an incident of molestation and attempt to rape that embroils the life of three working women Meenal, Falak and Andrea in Delhi which results into a nightmare for them. A late night out at a rock concert followed by a dinner invite at a resort in Surajkund by three boys whom they met through a common friend triggers a chain of unpleasant incidents that rocks their peaceful life. Some incidents can break you or it can make you strong. Pink goes ballistic through its plot against the atrocities that is unleashed every day in the life of millions of women in our country and around the world. Amitabh Bachchan as Deepak Sehgal, a retired lawyer has been a silent witness of the whole ordeal the three girls have gone through who actually stays across his flat, decides to take up the case as their defense lawyer. The courtroom drama that hovers around the incident takes many satirical digs on male chauvinism, conservative mindset of our so-called progressive society, its misconception about perfect womanhood and their selective moral yardsticks for women. Amitabh Bachchan in his unique style and baritone voice spews anger as the defense counsel and list down points that can be made into a 'Women Safety Manual Rule Book' based on the arguments presented by his equally talented counterpart and prosecution lawyer Prashant played by Piyush Mishra in the film. Both Amitabh Bachchan and Piyush Mishra are outstanding and ups the court room drama by their performances, though, at times they go a bit over board and are found to be rhetoric. Dhritiman Chatterjee as the presiding judge makes the whole proceedings intriguing by his comments and timely interventions.Angad Bedi who plays the spoiled brat Rajveer stands apart and has done an impressive act. He is well supported by Raashul Tandon as Dumpy and Tushar Pandey as Vishwa who tries to broker peace between the girls and the boys. Vijay Varma one among the boys who actually was not there during the said incident plays a perfect misogynist pig who is hell bent to teach the girls a lesson. Mamta Malik as the Haryanvi SHO who manipulates with the FIR register leaves a mark through her performance.All the three girls are so realistic in their performance that you go through the ordeal along with them. The pain, embarrassment in the court, the anger, the outburst, the helplessness and all those emotional upheavals they go through becomes your own. Taapsee Pannu as Minal is brilliant, consistent and credible in her role. She is well supported by Kirti Kulhari as Falak Ali. Andrea Tariang as a girl from Meghalaya representing the 'North East' tag enacts very well her vulnerabilities and fear of being considered as the 'Other' in her own country. Pink despite its strong social message and stellar performances from all the actors has its share of flaws. A few to mention without revealing much: why the boys and their family remains low once the case goes to the court even after being in power and having all the muscle power is not mentioned or justified; after the Surajkund molestation bid there is another kidnap and molestation that happens with one of the girl in a moving car in the busy streets of Delhi which is not raised or even mentioned in the court by the defense lawyer Deepak Sehgal; the kind hearted and supporting house owner played by Vijay Nagpal is not even called or mentioned in the court as a party to collect evidence against the boys; the defense lawyer and his bipolar disorder is fleetingly mentioned and conveniently ignored; the ailing wife of the retired lawyer and they being a childless couple in the story doesn't further the story telling in any way. Nevertheless, Pink is a must watch because such movies need to be appreciated for its social relevance and for its content having the potential of being a change catalyst.Movie Rating: 9/10Cast: Amitabh Bachchan (Deepak Sehgal), Taapsee Pannu (Minal Arora), Kirti Kulhari (Falak Ali), Andrea Tariang (Andrea), Angad Bedi (Rajveer Singh), Raashul Tandon (Raunak Anand aka Dumpy), Tushar Pandey (Vishwa); Genre: Thriller,Drama; Director: Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury Producers: Rashmi Sharma,Shoojit Sircar Release Date: 16th September, 2016 Duration: 136 Minutes Language: Hindi"
"This movie is more of a 'slap in your face' drama that really entertains, fortunately. For a third world society like India (no offence in using the term 'third world'; we indeed are and its not derogatory), we still grapple big time with issues regarding perception and objectification of women. This movie takes each of that, head on and talks about all those supposedly uncomfortable things as if to say 'well if we are not going to talk about it, who is?"". Commendable effort from Aniruddha Chowdry (director), Shoojit Sircar (director of Piku; producer of this film) and the legendary Amitabh Bachchan. All actors were first rate, including the villains and the people who sat in that court as props. The movie fires the bullet right from the title card and never stops. This is a movie that will be celebrated for a long time, or so I hope!"
"The film starts with the incident happened between three girls Minal Arora as Taapsee Pannu ,Falak Ali as Kirti Kulhari, Andria as Andrea Tariang and Rajveer Singh as Angad Bedi and his two friends. The visuals of the incident are not shown in the movie.To take revenge, Angad and his friends try to disturb the routine life of the girls.The extent of the interfere has gone to the next level as they abduct the Minal. This feels so real and compelling. The director try to show the raw actions of human.To respond to this Minal files the FIR against the Rajveer who comes form rich political background.Here comes in picture Deepak Sehgall as Amitabh Bachchan. He is a lawyer suffering from bipolar disorder who experiences frequent mood swings. He is willing to fight for the Minal against Rajveer. The character seems to be quite slow and nonfunctional but when he made up mind to fight this case; the character becomes more bold and compelling.The next is judicial fight between Deepak and Piyush Mishra as lawyer of Rajveer is so realistic. This shows the judicial system of India and changing mindset of the people biased with gender.The film ends with verdict of court. This film is need of the hour."
"When introducing myself to Indian cinema, ""Pink"" was the first on the watchlist. The thriller/courtroom-drama intrigued me with its impressive 8.2/10: which means it's above average. However, watching it, I was boggled by how average it was.Sure, it can be gripping and intense: I like how the first-half of the film is a straight up thriller and the second follows a courtroom-drama template, it gives the film a unique structure, one that helps it stand out.But my real problem with the film is the theme. Not the theme itself, but rather the subtlety of it. The film has a clear agenda of the way women are treated in India. And while that's not a bad message in itself, ""Pink"" is very preachy about it, depicting it's story as very black and white, the villains of the film have no redeeming qualities and are just depicted as stereotypically misogynistic. It bangs you over the head with what comes across as propaganda, and it really halts the enjoyment of the experience.I wanted to call this film excellent; however, I can only pass it off as mediocre. The acting is great, the film looks astonishing and the story can be gripping. But being bogged down and ruined by a unsubtle narrative, I can only say ""Pink"" is passable."
It was one of the finest movie Of Bollywood ever ...
The movie was good. Everyone acted very well in the movie. Some scenes are boring. The movie was interesting and thrilling. BGM is good in the movie.
"Pink is a masterpiece and it's up to expectations. Simply perfect movie having social message. Classy performances given by Amitabh Bachchan. A movie having a very different message that when a girl says NO, she could be anyone, your girl friend, your date, your wife or even a sex worker, it means a NO. Everyone might have different views on it, but i'll recommend it to must watch - you'd not be disappointed."
"Hollywood has a tradition of exploiting the potential of its senior citizens to the fullest extent. Many of these actors have actually surpassed the achievements of their younger versions by wide margins. A case in point - Sean Connery. Notwithstanding the obsession of my father's generation with the Bond avatar of Connery, an elderly Connery in 'Name of the Rose' or 'Indiana Jones' provided a much better viewing. Thankfully, Bollywood broke out of its traditional mode of not recognising its senior citizens when Amitabh Bachchan joined the ranks of the veterans. As Mr. Bachchan continued to reinvent himself from 'Black' to 'Pink', the audience ended up being the real gainers. Anything and everything with him in it is worth the watch. 'Pink' has very successfully used Mr. Bachchan's status and tremendous screen presence to send its core message across. The number of reported and unreported cases of sexual harassment are huge in this country and they continue unchecked and unabated because society at large still insist on blaming the the victims instead of the perpetrators. Unfortunately, herein lies the inherent of this movie as well. The three young women, sharing a rented flat in an upper-middle class enclave, going about being everyday working women in the capital appear normal enough at the first glance. If you look closely though all of them happen to have somewhat unusual background. One of them comes from the North-East - considered to have 'loose morals' and a whole host of unsavoury character traits by a huge section of Indians from other parts of the country. Another is recovering from a broken relationship with an entangled financial situation. Yet another has boyfriend who happens to be the sidekick of a shady youngster from a politically powerful family. Sure, none of the protagonists are unusual but they are atypical. What about a middle-class girl from middle-India, without any shady boyfriend or a complicated past relation, sharing a rented accommodation in Delhi simply because her family live elsewhere? Are we to assume then that what happened to the trio would not happen to the standard, typical, 'good' girls? Are we, after all, passing judgement on the victims again? Perhaps A can't get away from the lure of blaming the victims - it's easy. Being rescued by Mr. Bachchan's incidental proximity and legal skills is also rather fairy-tale-ish. Very feel-good. Life, unfortunately, is never black & white or even pink - it actually is myriad depressing shades of grey!"
"There are movies that have great plot lines, there are movies that have great actors who make the movie great, there are movies which have great directors. But this is a movie with a great message and one that our Indian society needs to listen, believe and enact upon.Incidents happen and are forgotten, people speak and they go quiet, mass movements are organized and they fade. But our mindset has not really changed. We still judge a woman's character by the way she dresses, the way she starts to feel comfortable with someone, by the time she steps in and out of home, by her choice of consuming alcohol or not, and the list can grow pretty long.PINK tries to make that exact same point that any sane society believes in, that we cannot have different set of rules to judge someone's character. One gender cannot be judged by some specific set of rules that do not apply to the other gender. In fact, it isn't even about the gender, judging anyone's character is a crime we all commit when none of us can measure our own selves with the same set of rules in the same scale of balance and come out of it pure and serene.Now, going towards the movie's review, this movie shouldn't be judged by it's story line, direction, editing, cinematography, or the acting. All of which were commendable in their own way so as to put through the point that the movie was trying to present to the audience precisely. Rather, it should be judged by the fact that our society deeply suffers from this disease of judging a woman's character and act with her in a manner according to the outcome of our judgement as we see fit. The part where Rajveer's character says that everybody present in the courtroom would feel the same way bout girls like these sums up the thought process of a great part of our society.Amitabh Bachchan's character's expressions in the end personifies the sorry state our country would feel at times like these. When we have to issue a manual about the woman's safety in our society. The points mentioned by Deepak Sehgal that should be there in the manual are cruel but true.I can go on and on about the greatness and seriousness of the point that the director has tried to put across, but it'd all be for nothing if we'd feel that it was another good movie that made a good point.We need to change the way we grow up our boys and nurture them with the idea of respecting a woman's modesty and understand the firmness, completeness and absoluteness of the word NO. I wish dearly that I witness this change in our society in this lifetime where movies like PINK are no longer NECESSARY to make us realize that the way we treat women in our somewhat modern society, sometimes, is inhumane.Going away from the preachy tone of this review I'd like to mention that the acting of all the characters, Amitabh Bachchan, Tapsee Pannu, and the other girls, Kirti and Andrea in fact, especially was just what was required, nothing less nothing more. It was believable and you could feel their helplessness. The direction by Aniruddha Roy Chaudhary was really good.All in all, for me, this is more than your good , bad, average Bollywood movie. Seemed like a message to be thought and enacted upon, by Shoojit Sircar"
"If we consider song,movie, novel such literary stuff are the mirror of society than 'Pink' is a very important socially sensitive art-product. These kinds of movies play very important role to strike the orthodox thinking of all the classes of people. If we take a glance over the essence of the socio-sensitive movies of South Asian subcontinent, definitely Pink dazzled us showing the paradigm shift. We've seen plenty of feminist movies, where society has been battered with the questions of basic female rights, oppression against women and the ubiquitous male chauvinist ideas. If we analyze discerningly them, we'd see women were tended to picture as the incarnation of 'Seeta' who emblems the typical desired husband-devotee Indian girl by our male chauvinist thought. Of course at the end of the story she is proved as virgin and the worshiper of her husband.In the movie Pink, the girls who were sued for some attempt to murder offense, were not portrayed like previously pointed theme. One of them was not virgin, which was presented at the court, and why not if it's a true? It isn't a crime to have a sexual relationship with mutual understanding. One of the girl had an affair with an aged professor who was divorced and lived separately alone. The opponent prosecutor tried to harass her with this earnestly private issue, questing her repeatedly to trumpet the taboo. Two independent adult humans(not necessarily needed to be heterosexual) can have a love affair with their own will. These two events don't prove anything malice like the society think it's kind of 'Whorish'. It focuses on a less discussed fact too, a tribal girl is harassed more than an average Indian girl, I'm a Bangladeshi, it's also true in my society, I aver it from some of my friends' experience. Radical ideas are shattering, after all, society's flow often goes to the way of light, despite some black-holly occurrences. Certainly, it adds a new dimension to the thinking of cinema, to the thinking towards our girls. I can't resist the final dialogue rendered by the great Amitabha bacchan, ""No is not just a word, it's a complete sentence, when a girl says No, it's No, she might be your friend, wife, girlfriend or a sex worker."""
"PINK is a relevant cautionary tale, a wake-up call and a powerful social commentary that depicts the plight of women and their place in the Indian society. The first half of the film proceeds as a fast paced intense thriller while the second half as a riveting courtroom drama that left me chilled to my bones.The entire cast gives admirable performances but the film belongs to Amithabh Bacchan as a veteran lawyer who returns from retirement to defend three helpless women with one charged for attempted murder. He is simply at his wicked best here. But Piyush Mishra as a ruthless prosecutor almost gives Amithabh a good run for his money.The narrative is spellbinding thanks to a raw and a realistic screenplay. As for the direction, there isn't a false note in the direction of Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury. It's simply flawless.This is a film not to be missed.P.S. The title of the film is real food for thought."
Such a powerful movie. A must watch movie. The content and the presentation is too good that we actually wont feel like we are watching a movie we get feeling we are actually living it. Amitabh sir's acting makes it so powerful that people will be forced to rethink what they believe about modern girls today. Hope these kind of movies could influence at least some of the people to change their mind. We really need to promote such movies than the daily masala movies. All the artists in the movie has done their part so well. I would love to watch the movie again and again and listen to each and every dialogue in the court room. Mainly Amitabh Sir's dialogues which is still booming in my ears.
"Modern society has came along a lot. Feminism is not confined into household work. With the changing time, girls are doing jobs, staying away from the families, staying late night in the parties. But that doesn't mean she has given away her honor' and if she says no to any intimacy it means no. The statement comes very strongly in the film through a thought provoking story that captivates your interest to the very end. The film pictures a scenario of the modern society and alerts you of the perverts in the society.The film is told through three ladies sharing an apartment who encounter a situation in which their modesty is questioned in the court, and they are defended by a mentally disturbed advocate played by Amitabh Bachchan. All the three ladies have given mind blowing performances and represented today's generation for which their name credits roll before Amitabh Bachchan's, who himself gives a mind blowing performance. This year I have watched both his earliest film ""Saat Hindustani"" and latest one ""Pink"" and in the both, he has established himself a better performer than a superstar. Overall, it's commendable that movies like ""Pink"" depict the real picture of the present generation and even alerts you.Rating: 3 stars out of 4"
"I've just seen Pink. It's brilliant and gripping storytelling keeps us interested while addressing some of the unspoken problems faced by ""modern"" women.The prejudice and the judgment that they face from the society. I don't want to discuss anything regarding the plot of the film because I think it will spoil the experience for the audience. It is an excellent courtroom drama and if you are not into the movies that don't have any action. Then maybe you won't like it. I also liked the way the movie unfolds and it makes us care for the characters. The performances by all the lead actors are real, not filmy or bollywoodized. It's probably the best film I've ever seen. In my opinion, it is a must watch for everyone."
"The theatre was full and people where even ready to buy off any extra seats if available. the three protagonists :- taapsee pannu , kirti kulhari,and Andrea Tariang have done a magnificent job portraying characters of victims of eve teasing, molestation and gender inequalities. The most beautiful thing about the movie is it doesn't bore you with back stories and unwanted emotional dramas the court sessions are fast and cut to cut so u don't have to sit through the unwanted crying and sobbing instead you can directly focus on the topic. Amitabh bachchan played an amazing advocate in the film and have shown that he reigns bollywood. A must watch not only for girls but also for all those who are against the above said issues."
"The movie has been very much successfully address the paradigm of Indian society about general thinking of Indian males for female sexuality.... but... Alas, it will remain a favorite among educated movie goers of tier 1 cities and as the seat occupancy suggests it make disturbed the general movie goers in tier 2 and 3 city where girls are till now treated according to their clothes etc. The actors, especially Amitabh is at his best while the newcomers delivered brilliantly. Taapsi Pannu is undoubtedly brilliant. The convincing portrayal of the characters and the environment makes the film outstanding which is rare in Indian cinema, addicted to dancing and fighting characters.."
"Another movie that brings us to verge of understanding how society is ruled by men and specially men who have political power. Although movie don't depict any extreme crime but it do hind how today's women's life is under constant threat. A well said sentence in the move is we should protect our boys so girls will be automatically protected. We never mind what our boy's does and never punish or regulate them the reason they dare to outrage modesty of our women so frequently. It's not men don't suffer but maximum suffering is born by our women. Who fails to fight the power and archaic social laws supporting only men. We have think of training our women in hard skills such as martial art so they too grow strong and protect themselves and even if they does another ""pink"" is perhaps written by another MP or MLA's son or son in law or some relative. The growing criminalizing of politics can be seen everywhere unless you stay disconnected some or other way you may get affected. This is what we live, learn and teach our sister's and daughter's. Beta do this, do that but taking a lesson from them why don't we teach our son and other men members do that and do this? A question all need to ask and answer. Pink only describes that answer in a beautiful and subtle way bringing human touch to many situations. A must movie by every girl to know the rule book of life for them. And what they must not do."
"There have been many movies that portray the struggle of women. However, Pink is probably the only movie that shows that sexual harassment is not about the victim's honor in society. It is about someone invading you without your permission. The climax, however, is what one can only imagine.Hats off to Anniruddha Roy. Totally worth a watch. I have now started finding better movies through https://www.flickstree.com/discover-movies . it not only suggests great movies to watch, it also tells where you can watch the movie online. Highly recommended"
"I am just out of the cinema hall after watching ""Pink"" and it was one numbing experience. While I was watching the film, I did not dare to move my eyes off the screen for fear of missing any vital plot element. ""Pink"" is one of the most talked about films of recent times, so I do not need to really repeat its plot. I will just mention the parts that I found good and, in most cases, touching and quite relevant to the situation around us nowadays.1. I liked the way the defence lawyer, Deepak Sehgal (played by Amitabh Bachchan), conducts the proceeding in the courtroom as a ""Rule Book for Safety of Women"". This rule book includes points like whether a woman should go out with an unknown man or not, whether she should smile or be friendly or not, what kind of clothes she should wear, the difference between different kinds of women (women from good families, women with questionable characters, etc.), which women drink at parties, etc., and then he uses these same points against the prosecution.2. Kirti Kulhari (as Falak, the only breadwinner in her family) comes across as the more powerful performer. Of course, Tapasee Pannu (playing Minal, and Tapasee Pannu is terrific) is the person around which the story revolves, we see that Minal is already a strong character. Her modesty was outraged and she retaliates. Falak wasn't involved at all. However, Falak, not wishing to push matters further, calls for a ""compromise"" between the two parties. Till this point, she is a vulnerable and insecure character. However, when she realises that her apology doesn't mean anything to the men who had tried to molest her friend, she snaps and turns into a more powerful character. Even in the courtroom, Falak is restrained. But when she realises that the prosecution is hell-bent upon proving the three women are prostitutes, her breaking down scene is worth a mention.3. Andrea (played by Andrea Tariang) is from Meghalaya. Her mentioning that as a girl from the northeast India, the humiliation she faces is different and severe from the humiliation that women from the mainland India face, that is, perhaps, a reality that has been stated very clearly➖and, surprisingly, in a mainstream Bollywood film. The first time the issue of harassment of women from the northeast India was raised in a mainstream Hindi film was, perhaps, in Yash Raj Films' ""Chak De! India"", released nine years ago➖and, coincidentally, set in Delhi. But ""Chak De! India"", despite its serious cinema garb, was an out and all commercial film, and the girls in it were hockey players, a complete team. Those girls could fight and break the bones of those who harassed them. The three girls in ""Pink"" are ordinary women working in a big city; and though they are strong-willed, they are not rich or well-connected or even in a huge group of 12 or 15. So the situation of women in ""Pink"" is different - and more closer to reality - than in ""Chak De! India"".4. In the scene where Minal and her lawyer, Deepak Sehgal, are shown jogging together early in the morning, Minal, conscious that people are watching her - now that she is fighting a case that has become so public - pulls the hood of her sweatshirt over her head so that no one is able to see her face. Deepak Sehgal, her lawyer, pulls her hood off. This is a very significant scene that implies that the lawyer trusts his client, knows that she is innocent, and that she has nothing to be ashamed of or hide her face for.5. When the three girls, along with their lawyer, Deepak Sehgal, visit Sehgal's dying wife, Sara (played by Mamata Shankar), in the hospital, Sara gifts Minal a packet of biscuits and tells the three girls: ""Khao."" (""Eat."") This is a very short scene, but quite a touching scene.The entire film is full of lines like ""Tum log toh ladki ho"" (""You three are mere women"") and ""You should have been careful"". However, the two lines that stayed with me are:1. Falak, accompanied by Andrea (Minal is in police custody), telling - rather pleading before - lawyer Deepak Sehgal: ""Sir, we are just ordinary working women.""2. Deepak Sehgal's ""No means no➖whether it's your friend, lover, or even wife"" argument ending monologue at the end of the film. That sums up the entire theme of ""Pink"". A ""no"" means just one thing: ""no"".I couldn't really find any fault in ""Pink"". The film sticks to its theme and purpose so steadfastly without diverting anywhere that it works absolutely well. A flawless film. 10/10. And maybe I will watch it again. Also, I saw ""Pink"" in an ancient single-screen cinema hall which has Qube satellite projection and Dolby Digital sound, but where the ticket prices are still ₹15 and ₹25, and the colour of the ticket I purchased was - and it always is - interestingly, pink!"
"this movie says the dirt mentality of men towards a girl who want to live her life as a free women. this movie states the dirt mentality of specially Indian guy with understanding the that they have super power they can do what he want.......... specially if they have political power ,social power etc. the Indian society should be aware about it; which this movie very well try to give. very good movie is this just take a watch of it. (taapsee pannu)is that girl in this movie along with their two other friends and amitabh bachchan have done a very good and represent this issue very well and his char is a lawyer in this particular movie."
"I happened to read a few reviews of the movie. Everyone who is anyone was going gaga about the movie. Huffington Post was the only source that reviewed it as an average movie. Surely it was not possible that everyone got it wrong and only Huffpost got it right. I watch very few Hindi movies but curiosity got the better of me and so when Star Gold aired it at the weekend I decided to sit through it.Now I know why Huffpost is one of the most credible source of news in the world. People have their pet peeves and mine is bad acting. I can tolerate average movies but I cannot cannot stand bad acting. If you woke up one morning and decided to be an actor then you better learn how to act. The first hour of the movie is actually quite decent. The 3 girls who play the protagonists are not going to win an Oscar anytime soon but there is not much about their acting to complain about. There are a couple of very good performances in there as well, namely the old man who plays the landlord and even the main antagonists cousin who is out to exact revenge.Post the first hour the movie seriously takes a dip for the worse. A particular directorial skill that often goes unnoticed is merging scenes with one another. With Pink it feels like someone shot a few short movies and haphazardly stitched them together. It goes something like this, Court scene...girls sitting on sofa at home...court scene....Amitabh sitting on chair at home..court scene...Repeat. If Piyush Mishra was a Hollywood actor I am certain that at some stage in his career he would have been nominated for an Academy award for Best Supporting Actor.This is however one of his worst performances to date. Its like the Director told him, you have to go there and be really loud. Forget acting...just scream at every chance you get. Even the performances of the 3 protagonist girls takes a clear dip post the first hour. Amitabh Bachchan is Amitabh Bachchan. Even when he is not great he is alright. This is clearly not his best work. He just looks angry throughout the movie. Apparently he is suffering from some mental ailments but the director leaves that to our imagination. The directors directive to Amitabh was.........you have to be really really angry at every given chance.And then the best actor in the cast takes the stand. The bloke who plays the main villain. You really want to hit him on the head with something. Not because he is the villain and you want to hurt him but because he is that bad an actor. In the end the judge convicts 3 of the 4 accused on charges that were never proved or even discussed in the entire courtroom drama. Maybe the director just decided to skip that part totally. The subject of consent should have been discussed a long time ago in India and it really should not have taken a badly made movie to highlight the issue."
"Many men have certain ideas about what should be the characteristics of a good woman. She should dress in a particular way, she should behave in a certain way, she should talk in a certain way, etc etc. There is nothing wrong with this. In fact everyone has concepts like these. But to think that anyone who falls outside your concept of a decent individual is automatically a bad person is prejudice. To think that whatever habits which are considered normal for boys , are indications of moral deterioration in girls is misogyny. Pink drives these concepts into the head of the viewers constantly and effectively. It doesn't shy away from it's core message and takes out subtlety out of the equation. It uses country's greatest star to become one of the greatest champion of women rights to be put on screen. Amitabh Bachchan as Deepak Sehgal gives one of his most important and magnetic performances till date. There are memorable dialogues throughout the movie and it works as cure for deep rooted sexism in our society. This court room drama is engaging,thrilling, disturbing and heartfelt at the same time and films like these rarely get made."
"if you are an Amitabh Bachchan fan or suspense movie lover or if you are not this movie is definitely for you. After a long time, Bollywood got a good thriller movie. I think after ""Kahani"" this is the best thriller movie. I am not comparing this movie with ""Kahani"" or not telling this is as good as ""Kahani"" but this is a really watchable thriller movie. Well, I am not revealing the story but I think this will be good, the movie is a crime postmortem of three girls and there is a hidden story behind these girls problem. An aged lawyer takes the case and there are lots of turns and twists in this case. I think this is a fascinating story a very relatable storyline for today's reality. The director chose the right storyline and his direction was almost good. Amitabh plays the aged lawyer and his acting is simply fabulous. Again big B proved why he is a genius and different from others character role actors. Tapsee Pannu also has given a solid performance and I think her best Hindi movie performance is this. Rest of the cast are good and the director handled them very gently. background score should be better but that's not a big problem. The script is very rigid and the screenplay is equally good. Editing is another plus point for this movie.If you are a thriller movie lover and want to spend a good 2.5 hours, this movie is for you. Believe me, you will not regret."
"I do not want to take away from this film's importance in trying to advance a very important social and cultural issue in India (and in many other parts of the world). I also give the film makers kudos for the unique way in which the story unfolds; the details of the evening unravelling with the questioning of each witness. And the masterful scenes during the end credits.However, once again, we have an excellent premise which is failed in execution.The court case scenes failed to build realism and instead became farcical drama where the lawyers either spewed commentary or attempted to advance their case with witness ""gotcha moments"". It was cliché and reminiscent of court dramas of 1980.The defence's case appeared to rest more on sentiment than evidence. And the apparent *blow to the defence's story during one particular testimony was left completely unaddressed. I was frustrated beyond belief because it seemed completely far fetched that these women with gusto (shouting from their seats in court) were moments later, cowering excessively on the witness stand.Amitabh Bachchan's acting was sublime and played the quirkiness of the role brilliantly. However, he seemed to step out of character in his more final court appearances."
"You just have to go and see the movie for its crisp Script, a non melodramatic direction and edit.Building on a relate able story that we all read in newspapers and addressing many social ills that affect our everyday life and the prejudices that seem to have become our second skin without us even being aware of it, the movie is not a moment short or long and will leave all viewers affected by it.Its an excellent movie with very good to superlative performances by most actors in the movie. Big B dominates the second half but all actors get a chance to showcase their role that is drawn from everyday life and reflects our society threadbare.A must see for all."
"This movie is definitely one of the few sensible movie made by the Hindi Film Industry. A power packed script with some powerful acting skills displayed by Mr. Amitabh Bachchan, Tapsee Pannu and Mr. Piyush Mishra. The movie showcasing the real state of affairs in our society. Where a woman is blamed for anything that happens even if she is the victim. Great direction, great story. I am sure this movie will be able to draw the intelligent audiences of our country which is growing nowadays and is a great sign for the future of Indian cinema. Amitabh Bachchan lived up to his name this year and last year by putting up great performances in Piku,Wazir and Teen. I did not watch Teen but i heard from my friends that it is a good movie. Tapasee Pannu is the next big thing happening to Hindi Film Industry. She is definitely going to join the likes of Vidya Balan, Deepika Padukone and Radhika Apte in the coming years with her great acting skills in Baby and now in Pink."
Outstanding story and it was represented well in 2 hrs with incredible acting of the casts
"How many ever times you see the movie, it shakes you up from within and questions the filth ingrained in the psyche and the society we live in. If your soul doesn't feel it, then trust me, something inside you is definitely dead, and I hope it is not the conscience.PINK is a must watch for generations to come. It is a movie that every boy and man needs to see and understand. And after watching it, if a tear does not roll down your cheek, trust me, you are better off living alone in a forest than in a society.How I wish we get to see more of such hard hitting and realistic movies. Kudos to the entire team for such mind-blowing work. And special mention for the taut screenplay, editing and dialogues."
"Story revolves around a molestation case which leads to a court face-off. As the movie is already quite old at the time of writing this review, I'm skipping summarizing the story and would like to directly explain why I chose to give this movie a 7 and not a relatively higher score as others.
I found the court/judge to be biased towards the girls, many people might have ignored this because we as an audience had a idea of what happened but we have to keep in mind the court didn't know anything. I felt like the movie wanted to give a positive message which it successfully did but at the cost of some fallacies in the script. The defense never proved that the 'guilty' Rajveer actually molest Minal Arora and gave hima sentence. Also, Falak Ali admitted to having accepted money from the suspects which should mean that everything the girls reported in their statements could not be taken seriously as this was a very big lie on their part. But court somehow ignored that. Also, it seems like they deliberately chose a 'noth-eastern' girl to put forward the narrative that North-Eastern girls are more likely to be molested as she says in one of the scenes, this had nothing to do with the story and it felt 'extra' to me.
The film gives a good message but have it's short-comings, I'm sure the general audience will and have ignored it. The acting performances are A-grade and some of the messages are hard hitting. Go Watch it."
Sooooooo good I will be hearing it again throughout my life. Movie's message is also very strong.
This movie has to be watch by both the genders. As it's an awareness for women and a well thought lesson for men.
"PINK is a mirror for modern civilization that has yet to move past it's old beliefs and rituals,,,those beliefs that reflect women as inferior to men,and impose countless restrictions and prejudices on the better half of our society.A movie that can be used to garner some basic education in our young-uns so that they don't stray from the path called LIFE like this current generation has,or which our past generations failed to show us!!!!STORY and PLOT
Simple,a girl gets harassed,she replies and then suffers because of the might the INNOCENT victim,until a man fighting for a just cause intervenes.The flow is linear but is never boring,keeps to at your seat till the end.U realize what will happen next,but u still want to watch it.ACTING and CAST
Casting has been great,,Taapsee has blood grown as an actor,and is garnishing praises from all aroung,,Kirti has done so many decent movies,and is yet to be rated,supporting cast is really good especially Angad,,,but the show belongs to Amitabh sir,,fantastic,an actor for generations to watch and take inspiration from.
The actors were never out of phase,,writing too was pretty good,and everyone performs brilliantly.DIRECTION and SCREENPLAY
Some weaknesses,,few scenes were not necessary,,some angles were not implicated and touched(that's why a minus 1),but other than that,the work was fascinating.The whole team deserves an applause!Must watch for Indian audiences who need to shed that old mentality and also start respecting women,,,NO means NO!!!!!"
"No means No .
A good message to the society .
Show it to teenagers to understand that no means no"
