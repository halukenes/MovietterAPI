Reviews
"Truman Burbank is an ordinary guy in an ordinary little seaside town of Seahaven Island where nothing really happens. Everything is clean, everything is perfect, he knows people but never really connects to anyone. The one woman he ever really loved is not his wife and has long since left for the other side of the world where he longs to visit but feels he can never go. Paralysed by his fear of water since seeing his father die on a boating accident, Truman still feels he is missing something. A strange light falling from the sky, a man who reminds him of his dead father, a strange radio broadcast and the feeling that the world really stops when he shuts his eyes all combine to make him feel something is wrong  but what is it that he seeks but feels he cannot find?When I first saw this film it was with my girlfriend (who would then become my wife, then ex-wife!) and I remember how she and our friends felt a little bit cheated by the film that they had expected to be yet another wacky Jim Carrey comedy. In fairness to her and the others, it was easy to do this at the time  who would have thought that Jim Carrey would be able to act  certainly not the marketing department that sold this film on the basis of it being a hilarious film as opposed to the thoughtful and rewarding film it turned out to be. The plot can be viewed on so many levels that it is honestly easier to leave it to each viewer to take what they will from it. On the most obvious level it satirises the media, the emotional façade of television and (the increasingly relevant) look at reality shows. To others it will say as much about God, the empty drone of life and the things that we all desire. Of course to others it will just be a comedy with general comments to make  and there is nothing wrong with that whatsoever; in fact the multi-level approach works to make it appeal to many audiences.Starting as a comedy, I am always taken by how well the film moves to become more and more interesting but yet never loses sight of those audience members who have come for the basic story. Hence it delivers an enjoyable and engaging central narrative that, plainly put, makes for a comic and involving yarn  we grow to care for Truman and this makes the ending an emotional and satisfying one even if some viewers will bemoan the fact that (to them) it appears 'open ended'. That it is also a very thought-provoking affair is only a bonus, with the satire working on many levels. Of course by seeming to tackle so many subjects and issues in such a short running time, the film never really gets its teeth deep into any one of them but this is not a major problem because it leaves us to do that in our heads after the film finishes.The cast is roundly superb even if the majority of them are in minor roles. Of course it is easy now to look back at Carrey and accept that he can act straight but at the time it seemed so unlikely and few felt it was a good casting choice. Of course, seeing the end result it is clear that he can and he delivers such a great performance that he really makes the film work.He is comic but yet serious, sympathetic but not worthy of pity  it is a great delivery and one that basically meant that I now look at his Ace Ventura stuff as the 'other' category and see his acting as his real work (6 years ago that was vice versa). Carrey carries the film, being on screen for almost the entire film but he has good support from Linney, Emmerich, Krause and others who play it well despite being stuck in the necessary stiff and unreal roles. The controller etc roles are all well played and feature a collection of well known faces including a great support role from Harris through to roles for Giamatti, Shearer, Baker Hall and a few others. It may be Carrey's show but the support certainly helps.Overall this is a great film that can be appreciated as much for what it is on the surface (a great little comic story) as it can for the issues that it hints at all the time. There was a time when some viewers may have looked to a Carrey film to be a load of mugging an crude, basic laughs but this was the film that saw that change. Thought provoking, funny, entertaining, short, enjoyable and well acted throughout  well worth seeing and well worth coming back to several times."
"'The Truman Show' epitomizes strong and original storytelling on screen. This film is emotionally engaging, didactic, witty, dramatic and very unique. For those unfamiliar with the concept, Truman Burbank has never left his ideal home town of Sea Haven. What he doesn't know is that his entire environment is a materialized set and he is the ignorant star of a reality TV show of epic proportions.Taking this entirely original concept, writer Andrew Niccol and director Peter Wier take the viewer into territory uncharted by anything in film history. Thus, the plot is entirely unpredictable but still flows along expertly. The tightness of the screenplay and the immaculate pacing of Peter Wier contribute largely to this film's brilliance.The acting performances are amongst the best I've ever seen. Jim Carey is superb as Truman, effortlessly conveying his fears, desires and personality. Ed Harris is excellent as the reclusive creator of the production. In addition, the entire support cast appears synthetic enough to let the audience know they are ""acting"" for Truman but in some scenes let their ""genuine"" feelings shine through. The ensemble simply cannot be faulted. Carey was hardly done by not to get an Oscar nomination for his performance.The music and visuals are top notch. The cinematography has a reality TV feel that is clever but never intrusive. The shot selection is of the highest quality, particularly in the movie's final sequence. Muscially, this film is incredible. Phillip Glass is a dream on the piano, perfectly evoking the mood for each section of the narrative. The two combine excellently during the scene in which Truman breaks his routine for the first time. During the sequence, Truman makes subtle changes to the bland routine he follows compliantly every day. The emotion of the music when combined with the apparent simplicity of Truman's actions makes this scene one the most powerful I'v ever experienced.This film is an absolute gem. It effortlessly combines everything a classic film should have. It has comedy, drama, strong character development, atmosphere, originality, superb visuals, a superb score, tight writing, raises interesting moral questions as well as providing insight into the human condition. One cannot watch this spectacular film without wondering how a human would react when put in that kind of situation. It touches on our sense of adventure, desire for conformity and the courage we require to question the life we are presented with. 'The Truman Show' does all this in the most accessible and compelling fashion. One of the greatest films of our time."
"I asked a friend to describe The Truman Show.  He said, ""No, it's not a comedy, well...not exactly.""  I didn't quite understand until I watched it myself.  Truman takes on a tone quite different than any parody/comedies I've seen lately.  The point (the media and its destructive powers)  is subtlely relayed through dark humor, and you don't feel like the director is smashing you over the head with his morals.  Peter Weir demonstrated his artistic genius in Dead Poets Society and here as well. The soundtrack is great, Ed Harris is stellar (what were they THINKING at the Academy?) and for once I actually liked Jim Carrey. His performance wasn't ribald for once. The final scene--I will not reveal it--is a majestic, long-awaited finish to an intellectual movie. Some people will insist that it was boring or pointless.  Those are the same viewers who prefer slapstick, obvious humor to the subtle layers presented here.  This is a thinking person's movie.  If you can't see the underlying message here, of course you won't like it!"
"I've seen The Truman Show a multitude of times, and each time it gets better. First watching it at a young age (Roughly 10 years old), I never picked up on much of the deeper meaning behind the film. The idea of someone's whole life being a television program was simply entertaining. Now, as an older viewer and with more experience in analyzing books and movies, I can really pick up on the satirical meaning behind the plot. Truman plays the star of a 24/7 television program. His entire life is broadcasted for all the world to see. He is raised to believe that there is no real reason to try and leave his perfect ""island"". Throughout the film, we watch as Truman tries time and time again to discover the truth behind his life, and as he attempts to escape. The struggle he experiences while trying to break free from the artificial world can be seen as a satirical message. The world is trying to oppress you, and although difficult, you can escape. This is supported by a statement made by the creator of the Truman show. He said, ""We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented. It's as simple as that"". Several other hidden messages (Ideas) appear throughout the film. All the actors who play roles in Truman's life, are indeed fake. Despite directly lying to a person whose life is immediately affected by that lie, the actors/actresses show no emotion for Truman. This is comparable to the lack of care society has for the majority of its citizens. Overall, The Truman Show is filled with subliminal messages and hidden meanings, all of which can be directly tied back to daily life."
"When I first saw 'The Truman Show' I came out of the theatre amazed. This is your first clue that you are watching something different from your normal Jim Carrey movie. I love the dialogue, camera shot, performances, direction, music, and running time of this movie. There is nothing I would do to change it. I came away from 'The Truman Show' feeling inspired which is the goal of good filmmaking Jim Carrey was outstanding as Truman, underplaying him, not making him too comic or too dramatic, but giving true sincerity when asked. He deserved an Oscar nomination. Ed Harris has always been a good actor, but in this movie he's a great actor. He plays Christof with such arrogance and bullheadedness that you don't know whether he's helping or destroying Truman. He and the director, Peter Weir, deserved their Oscar nods.Weir, who directed the great 'Witness', uses different camera angles to make you feel like you're actually watching 'The Truman Show' and not a movie. He ends it before you get tired of the concept and helped Carrey and Harris give immaculate performances. Andrew Niccol script is a real star in the movie too because of it's inventiveness and ingenuity. Overall, 'The Truman Show' is what I like to call a true American classic."
"Life is starting to imitate satire. ""The Truman Show"" was only made seven years ago, but it predates the current mania for so-called ""reality"" television shows such as ""Big Brother"". The idea behind such shows is that they present the viewer with a slice of actual reality- real people in real situations with real emotions- rather than the simulated reality of drama or the edited reality of documentaries. The flaw in this idea is that nothing is more unreal than a reality show. The presence of the cameras has a distorting effect, inducing artificial behaviour patterns in those who appear in front of it, and the sort of people who star in such programmes are almost invariably eccentric exhibitionists. ""The Truman Show"" takes the central concept of reality TV shows one stage further in order to overcome this flaw: what would happen if we made a reality programme about a person who has absolutely no idea that he is appearing on television? Truman Burbank is an insurance executive, living in a small American seaside town called Seahaven, and happily married to a nurse named Meryl. Or at least he thinks he is. What Truman doesn't know is that he is the central character in a soap opera and that his whole life is a fiction. The company he works for does not exist. Seahaven, the island it stands on and the surrounding ocean are all part of a gigantic set, specially created for the programme and sealed off from the outside world in a gigantic geodesic dome. Everyone in Truman's life- Meryl, his mother, his colleagues at work, his best friend Marlon- are actors playing out their roles in his drama.For thirty years Truman has accepted his world unquestioningly, but at the beginning of the film a series of incidents- a light falling from the sky, the reappearance of his father, who was supposed to have drowned in a boating accident when Truman was a boy, strange messages picked up on his car radio- awaken his doubts. Although members of the cast make strenuous attempts to dissuade him, he decides to try and explore the world outside Seahaven; in particular he wants to travel to Fiji where he has been told that his former girlfriend Sylvia now lives. (Sylvia was written out of the show when the scriptwriters decided that he should marry Meryl instead).The film has certain similarities with another film from the late nineties, ""Pleasantville"", which dealt with an inverted version of the same idea; two teenagers from the real world are magically transported into the world of a fifties television show. In my view, however, ""The Truman Show"" is the better of the two. ""Pleasantville"" deals with its political themes in a heavy-handed way with some very obvious symbolism. ""The Truman Show"", although it deals with some weighty issues, is never ponderous or excessively serious; indeed, it is often very humorous. The main source of humour is the contrast between the naïve, trusting Truman and the behaviour of those around him, all living a lie and desperately trying to prevent Truman from finding out that it is a lie. I had previously thought of Jim Carrey as a rather annoying actor whose appeal was based upon the idea that manic overacting is in itself funny, but here as Truman he is very good indeed, both amusing and touching. I was also impressed by Ed Harris as Christof, the show's enigmatic producer.Another factor in the success of the film is its visual look. Seahaven (like the town in ""Pleasantville"") appears as an eerily perfect, not-quite-real version of the typical American small town, but was actually filmed in a real place, the purpose-built village of Seaside, Florida. There are similarities with the cult British sixties television series ""The Prisoner"", which was also filmed in an eerily perfect seaside village, Portmeirion in North Wales.The film is obviously a satire on the intrusiveness and obsession with celebrity of the modern media; added relevance was given by the fact that it came out shortly after the death of Princess Diana. There is, however, more to it than that. Much has been made of the film as religious allegory; it has been pointed out that Christof whose name is clearly, and quite deliberately, similar to ""Christ"", is a God-figure, whereas Truman (the ""True Man"") is a symbolic Everyman. It has even been claimed that the film is an anti-religious allegory, with Truman's final escape from Seahaven symbolic of man's need to break away from outdated religious dogmas. This is not an interpretation with which I would agree- if one is trying to put across a ""God is dead"" message, it seems odd to provide a God-figure who is very much real, not mythical or illusory. The imagery of the final scenes  the calm after the storm, the ascent up a flight of stairs into the sky and clouds- also struck me as religious rather than secular. Moreover, the film seems too complex to be reduced to any single allegorical meaning, although it certainly deals with the relationship between man and God. It also touches on man's need to explore- both to explore new places and also to explore new ideas and to break away from established ways of life and ways of thought- and on the nature of reality. Truman's world may seem unreal to us, but as Christof says, ""we accept the reality we are presented with"".This is a brilliant, multi-layered film, part comedy, part satire, part philosophical speculation, and in my view one of the two best movies of the late nineties. (The other was ""American Beauty""). I felt it should have taken the ""Best Picture"" Oscar for 1999- ""Shakespeare in Love"" is a good film, but ""The Truman Show"" is a great one. It confirms my view that Peter Weir is one of the best directors currently working. 10//10"
"It not so easy to be Jim Carrey, because nobody takes you seriously after many funny movies, even when he is ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT. He proved himself so many times in dramas, he is so great actor.This time, there is no grade for the script, 10 is too low, maybe 10++ would suffice. I must agree that in everything around us we can see only what we are capable to see, but this movie gives so many levels and many people would see it differently and ALL WILL BE THRILLED by this movie.People who are interested in the phenomenon of 'Big Brother',a kind of TV voyeurism (so present today) will see the ultimate human desire to observe somebody's life, from its beginning, and without consent of the person which is the object of that observing. There is nothing special in this man who is watched, but we like to have mirrors of our lives in other people (who knows why). Of course, the next layer is ethical: do we have the right to watch somebody's life, because we don't talk about a rat, but a human being who doesn't know that he is watched in a TV show. If we go further, we must ask ourselves, what is real in our life? There is is always some possibility that we are observed, directed, guided, monitored..., by somebody and our life is not so authentic as we used to think.Next layer: this movie talks about freedom and personal choice. How we want to be free, no matter what are the other alternatives are. Free to love who we want, free to go, free as much as it is possible. Of course, if we want to be free, if our mind and society stop us.FINALLY... The most interesting level is the spiritual one.This is a guidebook of the spiritual path. At first, this world is so secure and predictable place. We have our little lives and we can define everything what is important for us, to have some simplification of reality, to feel safe. This kind of ordinary life is a bit boring, but we are in a herd, we are not alone in our dungeon.But..., at some moment, this world is maybe not what we thought it is..., maybe we want more of our lives,and the world is not so simple and ordinary place. We feel that there is something BEHIND this so- called 'reality'. And we start to search, to test that reality, which gives us more and more 'magic' things as we go deeper. This is still a stage of curiosity, many people tasted this path and feeling, but at some superficial level.If we go further, we must fight the world. All possible obstacles will arise, people and circumstances. When Truman wants to see reality what it is, to be free, all his 'friends' and the complete crew don't let him to go our the ordinary tracks. So alike the spiritual quest. Then, the moment has come, men must be separated from boys, that is, the curious people from the real seekers. The latter are ready to give even their lives, to 'waste' their time, to face their worst fears, to be 'hunted' by the society (which wants they to be 'normal' again)..., but a true spiritual person won't give up. The same as Truman ('you'l have to kill me!!!!!!!'), the quest is the real one only if we are totally determined to follow our inner feeling and to search the truth. AT LAST..., we hit the 'border' of the world, the frontiers of the reality, we get know what this world really is. We are free to talk with our 'God' (though I think it is the final trick of our ego, to bring us back to be 'normal' again and it plays so many games to pull us back, by saying that there is nothing out there, everything is the same, and it is better in realm of ILLUSION). Only a real spiritual person will say 'thanks' for the offer, and go to freedom, no matter what it is, but it is OUR freedom, our insight, the world won't be the same anymore. It is such a pity that this is a kind of review, that I can't make a spoiler, to give more details, to relate the scenes from the movie and my points. But when you see it, you'll know what I am talking about.Again, you'll see what you are able to see, the movie will be deep in degree of your ability to open your mind. This scenario can't be beaten even by movies like Gandhi or Mozart, or any other. An excellent work of Andrew Niccol."
"""The Truman Show"" owes a lot to the direction of Peter Weir. Weir refuses to pump out the movies in a search for extra dollars. Instead he chooses wisely and directs brilliantly. Just by looking at a list of his movies will surprise and even amaze you. So as you would imagine ""The Truman Show"" is another success.Truman Burbank has the perfect life, or so he thought until finally his life long suspicions about his world begin to unravel. Even though the idea for Truman is not totally original, it is thought provoking enough and allows the audience to wonder, what if? If you think this couldn't happen, just look back over the years at the stupidity of the human race and think again.Jim Carrey once again nails his role, as do the entire cast. It is rare he fails to perform at a level that perfectly complements the movie and its genre. This is something he does not receive enough credit for. Acting for a comical role or a more dramatic role requires no less effort for the performance to be spot on."
"It's not often a Hollywood film arrives with such lofty ambitions as this. On one hand this is a high concept comedy in the vein of ""Groundhog Day"" about an unwitting man whose entire life has been a TV show.  This is also a Jim Carrey vehicle designed to display his charms.  On the other hand this a very satirical look at the way the media manipulates our reality.  The film also wants to take a philosophical look at free will vs. a higher power and reality vs. fantasy.  It doesn't always work as the satire often keeps you from thinking too deeply about the underlying themes and the philosophical stuff keeps the satire from biting as well as it could.  Credit engaging performances and solid and thoughtful direction from Weir for keeping things afloat and entertaining.  There are some great cinematic moments here.  I loved the ""stolen kiss on the beach at night"" and ""Cue the sun!""In the end this film is closer in spirit to psychological dramas and sci-fi movies where a person suddenly realizes they are the pawn in some grand experiment or a prisoner in an alien world than it is to anything in our current ""reality TV"" obsessed culture.  Eventually it touches on a very basic conflict all humans must face (most people do so in childhood, some I fear never do).  The universe does not revolve around us.  In the closing moments we are excited for Truman because he finally realizes there is a whole new world out there to explore, but also slightly saddened because we know all to well that he will never be able to return to that idyllic ""childhood"" existence.  How's it going to end?  Who knows...but things will never be the same."
"I loved this movie. Everything about it. It is one you just want to watch over and over again. Jim Carey, as usually, played an amazing role. He made you think you were him, as the whole movie did. Watch it... its a must.Imagine being captivated all your life in a show, without knowing. Your neighbors, your family, your loved ones... everyone you ever knew were just actors, pretending to be people they are not. Well Truman Burbank not only imagined it, but also lived it. This is a hilarious movie, that will catch you from the first minute you watch it. Just be aware... once you start watching it, it will be difficult to stop. I rate this movie 5/5, with no negative comments."
"When I was a young adult on the search for my true self, religion and God; I found myself reading all kinds of books such as: Demian, Sidarta, Brave New World, 1984, the works of Jean Paul Sartre and Simone de Bolvoir. The world of Truman Burbank certainly took me back to those days. I used to look at myself in the mirror and say out loud: ""I wonder if I am me? I wonder if everybody thinks the same shade of red when I say red? Why was I born? Why are my parents my parents? Why did God create the world? Will I get punished by God for thinking all these things?"" This is a deep movie, bound to become an art film.  Jim Carey did such a superb job that it earned him a Golden Globe Award. This is definitely an Oscar contender. It made me think! What a suprise! Movies do not make me think very often. They are predictable to me now. Could it be age?When the lady comes on the bike with the basket, then the dog and then the yellow Volkswagen it reminded me of how repetitive life seems at times, when we think that nothing is going to change and we want changes. The Director was like God,  the creator,  although at times he was a mean guy, I think that all of us have questioned God and have been angry at him. Truman's world seemed so ""perfect"", no messy hair, no trash. Just phony! Our world seems much like that, everything is a matter of perception.The audience that watched the Truman Show in the movie was a hedonistic audience of consumers who wanted to be entertained no matter what the cost to Truman, reminded me of the soaps, of the Paparazzi, of how we like to know about the celebrities, and ultimatly of how the product could be the death of someone such as Princess Diana, or Truman Burbank.Purchase the video and watch it many times and many other symbols will come to mind. Like Jim Carey stated while he received the Golden Globe that he would enjoy it down to the crunchy chewy part."
"Although it sometimes seems that Hollywood is catering to the lowest common denominator of everything, The Truman Show is proof that there are great ideas that are able to be turned into great movies.  Jim Carrey plays an excellent role as a man with whom you can emphasize as well as be entertained by.  The film's surrealistic nature is frightening when the viewer realizes the legal feasibility in today's society, and it offers a great message about who or what we assume God to be and how He (he?) would react to our personal drives for discovery to challenge a world we treat as an aquarium.  Some things to note and ponder: The way the real-life viewers ignore the real lives of their compatriots and customers while focusing on a false life on screen; whose life is more real and whose is worth living?  Also, note that Christof does not have his name listed among the ""real world"" in the credits, but in ""Christof's World.""  His high-profile media-driven life is no different from Truman's!"
"Having been bandied about the release schedules for the best part of a year, Carrey's first semi-dramatic film finally got a UK release last October. He plays Truman Burbank, a vaguely unhappy insurance salesman in the perfect little seaside town of Seahaven. Following some strange occurrences, Truman starts to think that he is being watched. Little does he know that his entire life is secretly filmed, his town is a gigantic sound-stage, everyone he has ever known was an actor and that his every waking and sleeping second is broadcast around the world as a top-rated docu-soap.Critics have been lavishing enormous praise on this movie since it opened in America last June, and probably rightly so because it is a superbly crafted piece of work. Weir's direction is outstanding, frequently viewing events from the point of view of hidden spy cameras, such as the one in Truman's car radio. One stunning shot has the town's main street full of motionless extras, waiting for Truman to turn the corner. Jim Carrey's performance has been singled out for particular praise, and though his acting is of a much higher standard that his usual comedy antics, it is not exactly Laurence Olivier. This said, an Oscar nomination would have been well deserved.
The setting of a chirpy small town from which escape is impossible echoes cult 60's series The Prisoner, but the balance of reality and poetry is much more restrained here than it was then. The opening credits are especially clever, using those of the actual `show' (e.g. Truman Burbank as Himself). There are, however, a few problems. The film is simply too short to adequately explore Truman's situation, and the character of Meryl, his `wife', disappears about half-an-hour from the end. This kind of slightly sloppy scripting was not something I expected from writer Andrew Niccol, whose previous film Gattaca, which he also directed, was such an immediate classic. Gripes aside, this is an extraordinary and highly original film that really is worth seeing several times to fully understand the director's message. It doesn't even matter if you never liked Jim Carrey before. You will now."
"""The Truman Show"" is a rarity in Hollywood - or movies in general - a film that actually makes the audience think, and is about ideas. How do we know what we see is real? Why do we accept what is around us without questioning it? What would happen if we found out that a fundamental we were making about the world turned out to be completely wrong? You'd think a movie that was about those things would be a chore to get through, but in fact ""The Truman Show"" is great fun. I certainly wouldn't call it a comedy (although there are a few light moments here and there), but it's not too heavy and goes down easy.It might sound like exaggeration, but the scene where Truman first starts to realize what's going on is one of the best scenes I've seen in any movie, because of Carrey's acting, the direction, and also because of the Philip Glass soundtrack (which was critical to making that scene work).If you haven't seen The Truman Show, do yourself a favor and check it out."
"As many fans know, Jim Carrey is the man when it comes to slapstick comedy. His comical physicality is outrageous and his ability to emulate anything from cartoons to other actors is top notch. But anytime before 1998 I think I can safely say that not many people saw Carrey try and jump out of his shell and try a role that wasn't truly in the comedy genre. I definitely didn't see it coming. And to be honest, I wasn't sure if I would really enjoy it. But in the end, I did, not only because of how well Carrey portrayed his character but with an excellent story to back if up.The plot is about Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) who is viewed live 24 hours a day, uncensored, as a soap opera to the real world through public broadcasting. The thing is, Truman Burbank is the only one who doesn't know this. Everything else around is all a set-up. And when I mean everything,...everything...is a set-up. Even the sun is fake! Nothing is real. All the people Burbank knows are all actors. People who go through the same routine every day.And that's partially what makes this film so great. Every piece of the ""set"" that Truman Burbank lives in is so believable. Along with this is Christof, acted by Ed Harris. Christof is the creator of Truman's world and he essentially plays God. Everything that Truman Burbank is as a person, was created under the supervision of Christof. The whole story itself, written by Andrew Niccol, brings up the controversial issue of nature vs nurture. Who should have control over whose life. Well I think that answer is obvious.Jim Carrey himself actually does have some comedic moments but it's not because he wants the movie to be a comedy. Carrey does what he does because it is the connection to how a human would react to such a situation that makes it funny. And along with those funny moments comes a real emotional performance. Sure Carrey can deliver laughs but also proves that he can portray human drama. That's a question a lot of people wanted to see if Carrey could pull off and he did it well.Adding to the emotion is composer Philip Glass' score. Yes, it did evoke the right emotions and I don't think it needed a theme either for this particular story. Usually I do, but it didn't seem necessary here. Unfortunately for me, I prefer to see Jim Carrey in his comedic skin. I didn't mind the different role that he took on here but it didn't feel like I was watching the movie I wanted to see. And I'll admit, I put too much thought into believing Jim Carrey would've made the film more comedy than drama, so basically I disappointed myself. So on that note, it could be disappointing to fans of Carrey for his comedic films as well.As the first drama film that comic gut buster Jim Carrey stars in, it is not that bad as some would expect it to be. Carrey can deliver a performance like real human but for the hardcore fans, it may upset."
"Have you ever thought you were being watched? Like you life was possibly a Television show? Well, Truman Burbank never did and this movie tells of how he found out his life was a TV show.Quite possibly one of the most imaginative plots ever, Peter Weir's The Truman Show shows how one man's vision (Ed Harris) of having someone's life be on TV (that being Truman played by Jim Carey)...without him knowing it. A totally real show that has no boundaries except the walls of the enormous set. With actors playing the roles of the townspeople in this perfect community, as it seems.Jim Carey is brilliant as the confused insurance salesman who just wants the truth about his life. The death of his ""father"" drowning at sea has given Truman a reason to stay in his town and not venture off. But the urge to see the woman of his dreams is all to much. She was moved to ""Fiji"" because of some problems. Laura Linney plays Truman's wife. She isn't only his wife but is a walking commercial. Whenever there is a product she brings home, it seems like she is telling the world how great it is. Noah Emmerich plays Truman's best friend Marlon. This always uplifting character brings comic relief for Truman when he needs it most. When Truman's world seems to be falling apart, he's there. When Truman just needs a friend, he's there. Marlon is the one part of his life that makes it seem so real when everything else seems so fake.What makes this movie so enjoyable other than the story is how the people act in this ""town"". The way they make sure Truman stays there and doesn't leave. How everybody has a routine and even the weather is controlled. In the opening scene Truman wakes up and heads off to work to have a stage light fall right in the street. Where it came from?...he doesn't know. But doesn't worry about it because life is going great...for now. Ed Harris's character Cristof a.k.a. the Creator is genius and maniacal. With his people working around the clock to make sure all is well, this world he has created is now a world wide phenomenon. He is on top of the world with millions of people watching his creation unfold.This sensational film about a man trying to find his way in the world is incredible. When everything seems like it doesn't add up, it just keeps getting more complicated and giving the viewer one hell of a good movie. The Truman Show is in a league of it's own."
"Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) is the most famous man in the world, and he doesn't even know it. Raised entirely 'within' a television show which comprises his entire world, Truman is an Everyman for the post-television age. Truman's world, ""Seahaven"", is an Eisenhower-era model of American bliss, recalling the prison-like Port Meirion and the moral certainty of Bedford Falls (Its a Wonderful Life). Surreptitiously filmed around the clock by 5000 hidden cameras, the show exists inside an enormous geodesic dome with simulated weather and even its own ocean. Through a series of production blunders Truman slowly realises that he is being controlled and that perhaps all in his world is not as it seems. His surrogate father by proxy, 'Christof' the producer/director, goes from being benevolent social scientist to evil genius as his attempts to frustrate Truman's wanderlust become more and more deadly. Will he escape?The film raises some interesting points about our fascination with life as seen through the magnifying lens of tv, and the morality of real lives viewed as so much entertainment. But like most soaps the scenes from ""The Truman Show"" that appear within the movie are variously dull, mawkish and sentimental. At points the film has a problem deciding on whether it is going to be a straight escape-chase movie or a philosophical piece about morality and technology. The t.v. show's inherent blandess also lends little to the pace or our sense that there are characters worth caring about.Carrey is good. This in itself is gratifying, and a tribute to a script that walks the tightrope of imitating bad t.v. in tandem with the metaphysical angst of Truman's unique situation. If it isn't quite the film it could have been, The Truman Show is still pretty much unique in the recent crop from our cultural overlords in Hollywood. No arthouse here, this is a watchable, big-budget think piece, with well-executed and stylish direction. Its too early to say but this film may have given some execs at NBC, ABC et al. one very bad idea..."
"A Solar eclipse occurs when a relatively small,  dark,  cold object comes between an observer and the brilliance of the sun.  A Best Picture eclipse occurs when ""Saved-By-The-Bell""-meets-""Amadeus"" and ""Saving Private Shmaltzy"" comes between the movie-going-public and the brilliance of ""The Truman Show.""Frankly,  I don't know how this script got past the powers-that-be in Hollywood.  It is a scathing indictment of the media.  My only guess is that they saw the word ""comedy"" and ""Jim Carrey"" and decided not to look at it too hard.  And judging from some of the comments here, it went over the heads of a pretty good slice of the viewing public as well.  This story is a modern-day fable -- for those with the eyes to see.If you are watching this to be entertained by Jim Carrey or to see a great sci-fi flick,  you will be disappointed.  If you are watching this to see the most elegant satire ever to grace the silver screen (maybe ever), then this movie is for you.I will have this one on DVD.  9/10 ---"
"The Truman Show may be approached on one level as social satire exposing the emptiness of an American Dream defined by consumerism and purveyed by the electronic media over the last half century. Life in ""Seahaven,"" the vast dome-enclosed set/community in which Truman (Jim Carrey) has been raised under the watchful eyes of a worldwide TV audience of millions, is a sharp and elaborate parody of the corporate sponsored images of middle-class American material bliss and innocence first introduced to mass television audiences through such '50s sitcoms as Ozzie and Harriet, Father Knows Best, and The Donna Reed Show. A closely related target of The Truman Show's satire is the pervasive voyeurism and passivity that has increasingly characterized American social behavior as witnessed in film (ED TV), entertainment television (tell-all talk shows, Reality TV, the talent search genre), and even broadcast news (disaster/victim footage).Yet, on another level, The Truman Show, like Gattaca, The Matrix, Dark City and other more obvious examples of science fiction, deals with broad philosophical themes such as free will versus determinism in human action, subjective versus objective perceptions of reality, the assertion of humanness through existential rebellion, and the quest for an authentic self/ identity. Most immediately, the names and plot functions of the film's two principal characters - ""Christof,"" the megalomaniacal producer/director of a 24/7 reality TV show, and ""Truman,"" the show's eponymous everyman figure - invite the viewer to approach the work allegorically.Legally adopted by a corporation (in a clever parallel to virgin birth), manipulated by the all-seeing all-powerful Christof (Ed Harris) into phony friendship and empty marriage with actor-minions, and psychologically conditioned (i.e. terrorized) into fearing adventure and change, Truman gradually begins to suspect that Seahaven is not the paradise it purports to be. To assert his humanity and escape his artificially prolonged state of childlike ignorance, Truman must ultimately undertake that most mythic of journeys, a Sea Voyage. At its end, he must turn his back on the secure, controlled environment of his ""heavenly"" father's house and step through a forbidding black passageway that leads to the true human condition: emotional and physical risk, scary freedom, and - perhaps - real love. In so doing, Truman ironically brings to his TV audience (whether they are still capable of appreciating it or not) the very affirmation that the false god of television claims they receive from the contrived ""hope and uplift"" pabulum the show has been ladling out for 30 years along with its subliminal primary diet of product placement advertisement. In its climactic scenes, The Truman Show reveals Christof to be neither a social visionary nor a benevolent deity. Rather, we learn he has much in common with Orwell's Big Brother and - allegorically - with the implacable, sadistic god that Melville's Ahab imagines is running things behind the sky's impenetrable veil. By literally rending the heaven of his imprisoning universe, Truman navigates his storm-tossed sailing ship toward a completion of the heroic quest that Ahab's mad distraction (and Melville's theological uncertainty) forestalls: he momentarily frees himself and us from the diabolical/divine puller of the chains of human fate. In its final act, The Truman Show recasts the tragic despair of Moby Dick as comic triumph."
"With its (all intentional of course) cheerfully colorful cinematography, cheesy music and one-dimensional supporting characters, it's easy to miss just how brilliant The Truman Show is; it's in fact one of the most important cinematic creations of the 1990's, at least as important as darker films like American History X and Fight Club, and one that works on several different levels. Because while it works quite clearly as a sarcastic satire and a commentary on the destructive and intrusive nature of the media in the post-modern age, in the light of the reality TV syndrome which was at the time just starting to grow, it's also a philosophical metaphor about the state of mankind.For Truman's story is man's story; and it's difficult not to see the importance in the names given to the lead characters. True Man's life, the film says, is an illusion, a lie. Or perhaps  all our lives are illusions, but the True Man is the one who figures it out and seeks a deeper truth. In its essence the point is very similar to the one The Matrix made; The Truman Show is a fascinating trip through Plato's Cave, and while it takes a rather simplistic look at Plato's philosophy  because any other way would be impossible in a film of less than two hours  it doesn't dumb it down. The Truman Show is a deep and intricate film that deserves repeated viewing and gets better with time, and can be discussed for hours.Writer Andrew Niccol  who made his breakthrough debut one year before with the critically acclaimed cult favorite Gattaca  lost the Oscar that year to the Academy's favorite Shakespeare In Love, and director Peter Weir got most of the credit for the film; but while it's certainly an important achievement for Weir and the best film of his long career, it's Niccol's sarcastic, intelligent, innovative script that made The Truman Show great; that, and the amazing performance by Jim Carrey, who showed his fantastic dramatic skills here for the first time. Carrey is enchanting in the lead role as the ultimate everyman Truman, and we're as fascinated with him as the show's fans in the film. Praise should also go to Ed Harris, who plays Christof, creator and director of The Truman Show (and again, special attention should be given to the character's name)  and also to Laura Linney, Noah Emmerich, Natasha McElhone, Harry Shearer, Peter Krause, Paul Giamatti and the rest of the wonderful supporting cast, both in Truman's world of Seahavan and in Christof's 'real' world. Finally, a word of praise for the excellent musical score, composed by Burkhard von Dallwitz and the great Philip Glass, which compliments the film's atmosphere to perfection.The Truman Show is not an easy movie to absorb; it's a disturbing tale and a disturbing message, which takes some time to seep in, and while it's entirely unconvincing as a reality and even as sci-fi, and feels more like a metaphor than a story of a specific man, it's also entirely involving and demands to be taken at face value. Truman's character is irresistibly charming, and just like the people watching The Truman Show, we believe in him and identify with him completely. The beauty of The Truman Show is that it's lots of fun; it proves that entertainment and art are not necessarily opposing ideals. By being entirely entertaining and gripping, it gets its messages across a whole lot better.The Truman Show is now eight years old: the way I see it, once a decade has passed, a film can begins to be considered a classic. The Truman Show will pass that test. In any possible aspect, The Truman Show is one of the absolute best films of the 90's, and one that will remain relevant long after reality TV has bitten the dust."
"With ""The Truman Show"", released in 1998, Peter Weir delivers a brilliant satire about the excesses of reality shows, with a prophetic relevance disguised under a misleading comedic mask. This underrated gem of the 90's, tells the original, to say the least, story of Truman Burbank, played by Jim Carrey in a breakthrough dramatic performance with this bit of tender wackiness we expect from him. Truman is an ordinary insurance salesman living in the small peaceful town of Seahaven. He's popular and lives in harmony with his wife, his mother, his best friend, his colleagues and neighbors. In appearance only  What Truman doesn't know, and here's the visionary originality on which relies his life, is that Seahaven, is in fact a huge studio with 5,000 cameras always keeping an eye on him and that everyone's an actor, including his wife, his mother, his best friend etc. and last but not least, all his life, was filmed since his birth to become the greatest and longest-running reality show in television history: 'The Truman Show'. Truman believed in a reality which is in fact, completely fictional, and all the protagonists of this pseudo reality, are puppets hanging on the string of the show's Creator who designs the perfect screenplay creating emotional cliffhangers for future episodes. The Creator is Kristoff, brilliantly portrayed by Ed Harris like a kind of almighty God, and the human incarnation of media's omnipotence. And Truman eventually realizes that his life is a huge hoax, and decides to leave the perfect utopia of Seahaven, and go discover the ""real"" world. Because that's the point: reality shows don't depict reality, but paint it with fiction, it's real fiction, but fiction nonetheless. The ambivalence is obvious in ""The Truman Show"". Truman's life is fictional, because all the protagonists play a role in order to create a story for the viewers. Viewers who follow the show like a soap opera with a 'realistic' dimension. Indeed, Truman's character is real, as stated by the creator of the show, he is the only ""real"" protagonist of this world, his reactions are spontaneous and sincere. The reality is pushed to (unscrupulous) limits, because unlike other shows, Truman doesn't know he's filmed, he's natural. His life is a fiction, but paradoxically a 'real' one. This is the semantic loophole, unscrupulous TV program managers use to justify the unrealistic aspect of their shows. The script's fascinating brilliance reminds of ""Network"" in the 70's, highlighting many unpleasant aspects of TV Reality, including the viewer's tacit complicity. Indeed, the viewer never minds the scripted aspect of reality as presented in TV programs as long as it improves his personal enjoyment, like for all these people who were assiduously following 'The Truman Show' in all over the world. The second aspect is the subjectivity of reality. Truman, for all his spontaneity and sincerity, was unknowingly following the storyline that producers traced. And all the situations were constructed to make him react according to a script. The process of mediation doesn't prevent from spontaneity, but it undermines its credibility by creating specific situations for premeditated reactions. Like in some programs where two people who don't appreciate each other or whose views totally differ, are both invited just to create a violent verbal confrontation -supposedly unexpected- to please the audience.Finally, the main lesson of the film lies on the climax where Truman, tries to leave the fictional world of Seahaven, materialized by the powerful symbol of a dome painted like a sky. Truman struggles to get outside before he faces the producer of the show. The latter warns him against the dangers of a hostile real world where truth is no worthier than elsewhere, and invites him to join the perfect utopia of Seahaven, where he's a hero. Truman's reaction is very symbolic. He left the cameras' world, like an artist who addresses his fans for the last time, with his famous catchphrase as a farewell, and finally gets out. This last pirouette, sublimated by the thrilling score of the film, earned him the applause of the audience, as if the excitement made them forget that the show was ending. Indeed, when the show was finally interrupted, two viewers quickly recovered from their emotions, and zapped to another program. The end. Truman is a genuine character, who understood the completely artificial status of his stardom. He therefore preferred to leave a charming utopia and face the real world. Television today launches ordinary people at the rank of stars for the simple reason that we, viewers, observed their everyday's moves, the details of their life's banality during weeks or months. But that kind of artificial popularity is inevitably ephemeral: it sinks into oblivion as soon as a new reality show emerges. And that's because camera's point view as depicted in the film, presents the reality in a dangerously subjective way. The 'staging', admitted by the public as it highlights positive values like friendship, fame, success, and empathy is a dangerous emotional depiction of reality. The risk is less for the viewer, who accepts the process, than for the protagonists of these emissions, whose purely artificial and prefabricated fame can lead to deep feelings of frustration later. The emotional excitement is binary, and plays on both positive and negative poles, it may present for the sake of transparency, real people who suffer and live under difficult conditions, whether in the context of stories, talk or reality shows. The danger here is moral, because with this constant clash between reality and fiction, how can we be sure that the depiction of suffering and frustration will inspire the audience positive psychological reactions like compassion and solidarity rather than a voyeuristic sadism mixed with a circumstantial empathy?""The Truman Show"", denounces the fictionalization of reality, through a remarkable fiction, that makes today's reality look like a less believable fiction "
"Have you ever felt like your not alone in you house. That maybe just maybe there's over half of the world watching you. The Truman Show is a film about a man called Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey). Who lives a normal life; with his normal job. But he is living in an abnormal world. Because Truman is living in his own world called sea heaven; sea heaven is actually a set and his home and job is all a lie. Truman has a world based around him and what ever he does the citizens of sea heaven have to go along with it. His Mum, Dad, Wife and even his best friend are all actors. The Truman show is filmed with the highest technology in cameras around. Small clip on cameras that can clip on to a jacket and not be seen. But when Truman sees that elevators have 4 men drinking tea in the back of them and that the radio has co-ordinates of his position on it he starts to get suspicious. The Truman Show has been nominated for three Oscars and has won three Baftas. Award winning director peter weir worked with paramount pictures to make this film a masterpiece. The Truman Show is a film that just about makes up for the horrible disasters of Godzilla and Armageddon, this film might be the film of the 90's.The Truman Show had a strict budget of $60 million and earned $125 million in film screenings alone. The Truman Show hasn't got any fancy graphics or any expensive cars or props its just pure film making and passion.Overall the Truman Show is a very good film, but my only criticism is that some of the background actors didn't look like they knew what they were doing. But overall there was no big mistakes in the plot. I would give this a five star rating."
"I sometimes wonder how my life will be if it were a TV show, I see this movie and i quit the wonder.The Truman Show was written by Andrew Niccol who got the inspiration from an episode of The Twilight Zone called ""Special Service"".After the script had gone through some re-writes, Jim Carrey was picked for the role, although the makers had to wait for him to have a clear schedule before he could start shooting.Made with a budget of over $ 60 million dollars, The Truman Show was a financial success and also was nominated for three categories in the Academy Awards, but did not win any awards.The movie tells the tale of an Insurance salesman Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) who lived his entire life, since before birth, in front of cameras for The Truman Show.Unaware of this fact, Truman's life is filmed through thousands of hidden cameras, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and broadcast live around the world, allowing executive producer Christof (Ed Harris) to capture Truman's real emotion and human behavior when put in certain situations that are concocted by the writers.The thrill about Truman's life is that everything is arranged for him, down to the woman he married to his best friend.The movie cinematography is such a way that you get to see mistakes from the show makers and how they arrange things in the back end to make Truman do some particular things.The script and the movie lines are fun, especially when the Actors had to advertise on the show. The could be a conversation going on then one of the actors will just drift to talk about an object in such a manner you wonder if they have lost it, only for you to figure out seconds later that it was an advert in the show, that was very creative.Before making this masterpiece, Jim Carrey had just finish Cable Guy (1996) and Liar Liar (1997).The movie is directed by Peter Weir (Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (2003)), who did a great job pulling the viewers along as they watch a movie of a show. Andrew Niccol went ahead to do more great movies from S1m0ne with Al pacino in 2002 to The Terminal with Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks in 2004."
"SPOILERS THROUGHOUT:Truman Show is without a doubt Carey's best work. I did not have the pleasure of seeing this until this year, where after seeing Bruce Almighty and becoming somewhat of a Jim Carey fan, I made an effort to watch more of his movies. Truman Show is an instant classic in all the right ways, it's a smart, well acted, somewhat eerie, and utterly unique masterpiece. It also gets better the more you watch it.I don't happen to like the genre of science fiction and nobody could deny Truman Show's got a bit of sci fi but I don't think it really falls under any one genre. What's really scary is the idea-this concept-is not so out there anymore, in today's times, that one could completely rule out that this could ever happen. It's creepy, very much so, in the way that The Original Stepford Wives is but more so in a way, and I wonder about what would be said about the movie had it been released currently, instead of the late 90's when reality TV was just starting to cause a ripple.I first started changing my thoughts on Carey after Bruce Almighty, a great movie (and one that is a lot more thought provoking then many give it credit for.) But as good as he was in that, he simply shines in Truman, everyone does, I loved Laura Linney as Truman's annoying, cold on screen wife Meryl. I've seen many of Linney's movies, this is one of her best.I'd advise people who haven't seen Truman Show to see it more then once-the first time I saw it, I thought it was about an 8 or 9, it grows on you and it's the kind of movie you want to see again as soon as it ends. There are a few frustrating things to be sure, I wish it had not ended so ambiguously, I'd have liked to see more of Truman's life after leaving the set, his relationship with Sylvia and what the other characters were feeling gone into a bit more. Also the audience. Was Truman an instant celebrity when he left or was he quickly forgotten in favor of the next flavor of the month by his devoted audience as is a bit inferred? Truman Show, unlike about 95 percent of movies made, does seem like a sequel could be made, although with how bad most sequels are I'd be a bit wary. Still, any flaws are not enough to prevent a 10 of 10 rating from me, you could be watching this movie for the 50th time and it still seems like it would inspire the same reaction."
"As inventive and creative as Weir's staging is, The Truman Show wouldn't work without credible Truman. And Carrey carries off the tricky role with a chipperness that belies a deep-seeded longing for more in life than surface perfection in all this movie is one of my all time favorites."
"The Truman Show is a tale that will tug at your heart strings. It's the movie that showed the world that Jim Carrey could play drama. His wild gesticulating or face distortion barely make an appearance compared to his previous incarnations.The film feels a little tacky, but it's dealing with a tacky subject: reality TV. It rode the wave of its inception as well as initial popularity and at the same time as it was making fun of it. Each character, but the main one, is a caricature of reality TV and its entourage, even its dissidents. It feels as fake as its subject, yet it brings important points. Is happy ignorance better than truth? Do you define yourself, or does your environment?The sweetness of it all will capture you. Truman's predicament will rivet you. The last scene will move you.See it, it's worth it."
"This is among Pete Weir's best ,just a notch or two under ""fearless"" or ""witness"" and much more worthwhile than weepies like ""dead poets society"".Jim Carrey is ,relatively speaking,sparing of gestures and ,hem!grimaces.However,in my humble opinion ,the best performance comes from Laura Linney,who's very funny,delivering lines as she would do commercials,and always with that suave smile on her face:she really acts as if she's in a play,and she 's anyway, as Paul Mac Cartney sang in ""Penny Lane"".Ed Harris is effective as a sort of God (TV has replaced God in many a home,like it or not),his spectacles and his bonnet make him almost unrecognizable.The humanism displayed by Weir is very close to that of Frank Capra,and Jim Carrey is some kind of James Stewart of the nineties,naïve,with a big heart.And like Colombus (his boat isn't it called ""Santa Maria""?),he has discovered a brand new world.Whether it's the best one remains to be seen."
"God.  I wanted to like this film.  I think Jim Carrey is a good actor.  An excellent physical comic, he's also capable of giving a heartfelt truthful performance.  He does it here.Confound it, I want to like everything Peter Weir does.  I frequently don't, but I'm always willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.  Anyone who can do a ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" can't be all bad.  He obviously has the capacity to make us see, feel, understand without overstating the obvious; while skirting the obvious, for heaven's sake!""The Truman Show,"" therefore, SHOULD have been one of my year's high points cinematically.  Maybe I was in a bad mood when I saw the advanced screening. I returned and actually paid to see it.  Maybe the first-view dyspepsia carried over, maybe I hadn't given it enough time.I rented it.Okay: I liked it less the second time I saw it.  I almost hated it on the third viewing.  (I know, I KNOW...A film -- play, painting, joke...whatever -- is meant to be grabbed on a first view, a single exposure.  Repeated looks are bound to let us explore the flaws...but, dammit, I was trying to give the thing a break.  Really.  It IS the kind of thing I should love...)What's wrong with Truman?  It's one of those things that SAYS it's going to do something.  It tells us what it intends to show, then proceeds to NOT show us, but to restate the thesis!  And the audience is expected to buy into the notion that the film has actually explored the issues... whatever they are.Truman, for me, is all statement and no delivery.  It gives us a wonderfully correct theme...a charming, easy to root-for hero...a potentially exciting and interestingly equivocal villain...then blows it all away because it hasn't got the courage of it's own set-up.What WOULD make Truman, despite a lifetime of conditioning, get on that boat?  NOTHING!!  He so easily accepts the unacceptable, he so easily overcomes every problem the film gives him, that there is no dramatic tension, no questions, no...no film!Of course, it presents us with a user-friendly, feel-good ending.  The sit-com man takes charge of his life.  Victory.  Vindication.  And we don't even have a clue what Truman's life -- or Life in general -- is about...nor, alas, does he.Sorry.  Too facile...like Jim Carrey's talking butt...an easy laugh, a go-for-the-guaranteed-result.  This film, for me, is a smug, simplistic, self-congratulatory exercise in Hollywood telling us what's wrong with Hollywood - and us.Go write your own screenplay on this theme.  Anyone could do it better."
"You may not like it, but you have to respect it.Brilliant, thoughtful director Peter Weir (The Last Wave AKA Black Rain, Picnic at Hanging Rock, Master and Commander, Gallipoli, Dead Poets Society, Fearless and many others) teams up with excellent screenwriter Andrew Niccol and a great cast to give us a science fiction film with a range of emotions exceedingly rare for big budget mainstream cinema. In addition to the really disturbing questions the film raises about the nature of reality, metaphysics, religion, entertainment, human cruelty, voyeurism, and the concept of freedom, the film also offers a glimpse of humanity simultaneously occupying its worst and best aspects.The cast is phenomenally good. Carrey gives Truman the life his rich and sympathetic character he deserves - providing some of the most disturbing comedy I have ever witnessed. Tasha McElhone, Ed Harris, Peter Krause and Laura Linney are all excellent - though you may end up hating most of them for various reasons as the film progresses.Truman's entire life, from his birth onward has been one long TV show. He is literally being broadcast 24/7/365 and he knows nothing of it. His mom, wife, best friend, and everybody around him are all cast members. And the show is shot in a giant set which simulates an island. Because of a traumatic experience with the sea during his childhood, Truman does not feel free to travel away from his island home.Yet Truman is oddly compelled to explore the world and has begun to suspect that something is very wrong. Meanwhile, in what we like to think of as the REAL WORLD, everybody is watching him. People stay home from work to participate vicariously in his life in hopes that they will somehow catch a clue to ""how it will end."" This film is pretty heavy. You might find it amusing the first time you watch it, but once you've allowed it to exhaust you a few times, all that is left is the superb craft and the intense and disturbing ideas it constantly bombards you with. The film has a dark side and a hopeful, light (but never airy) side which - amazingly - is exposed concurrently with the heavy stuff.The cinematography is as picture-perfect as most of the work Weir is associated with. The acting is remarkably good all around, with those mentioned above in the outstanding roles. Sound is usually a very important component of Weir's films, but it's a little underexploited in the Truman Show - perhaps to (sometimes with painful force) draw the audience's attention to the profoundly insane dialog.The Truman Show is plot heavy, heavy, a little funny, and profoundly smart. Do not see it under the influence of anything detrimental to your mind or emotional balance......FLEX YOUR HEAD."
"One of the great movies that kept me glued to my screen the entire time. Artistic, quirky, and dramatic, this is easily one of the most original ideas in the film industry."
"""The Truman Show"" is a unique film about the television obsession (or - as a true allegory - any kind of obsession) and the limits that people seem to leave behind when they're talking much about profit. Human dignity, law, any type of principals are pretty much dead during the first half of the film. Alongside Truman of course, the movie make you realise all the above and highlights the unfairness of the case.The Picture's end where the two guards just change channel after just a second of the end of a 30-years-program, seems to only give more emphasis to the moral of the whole film!""The Truman Show"" is a masterpiece and a MUST watch with friends or family!"
"This film hasn't aged a minute.It's an incredible exploration of the human psyche and spirit, to be sure, but it's also a love story. The love story is between Truman Burbank and his true self. In his trueness to himself, he cannot accept this reality as presented by Christof. When he starts trying to escape it, things and people start to look more transparent, and he begins to see illusions everywhere.It all starts with a stage light dropping out of the sky onto the street. Whoops! As he is given more and more clues, he starts trying new unpredictable things and observing the towns response. This escalates and it becomes truly fascinating.His obsession with Lauren, or Sylvia as it were, -is- just a little creepy, yes, but just how anyone would respond to being put in this situation is completely up for debate. Just what is the ""correct"" way to respond to this situation anyway? Remember he was born into it. This is his whole life.Christof's response to his escape attempt is indicative of his mindset: Truman is a Christof production--that is, Christof owns him. There was never any doubt that Truman's spirit would overcome everything that'd been programmed into him, because this is the story of a man who refuses to be a product. To be owned. To be a slave. ""You don't have cameras in my mind!""I saw this for the first time when it came out, and it has remained one of my favorite movies of all time. I found the ending to be stunning, watching this illusion fall like a house of cards is almost spiritual. There are no fancy special effects (other than the aerial view of the Truman's set; any other effects are quite transparent,) no out of control self-indulgent fanciness, no blockbusterism present at all. Merely solid craft work and an incredibly well done story.That's all it needs. If you haven't already, see it."
"I recently watched The Truman Show in my ELA class during our satire unit. I was pleasantly surprised when the movie actually turned out to be good. Before watching I read the description and I had my doubts but those were quickly cast aside while watching Jim Carrey play the main character Truman so well. Jim's funny personality really drove home the humor in the movie. Serious scenes were expertly acted by all members of the cast and I found myself enjoying every minute of the film.The Truman Show included many satirical elements inside some of the funnier scenes in the movie. The film uses satire as a means to show the audience that forcing your own ideals on someone is not always a good idea. In the movie, the director tries to play god and run the life of Truman. Truman eventually finds out that his entire life is a lie and tries to escape. After Truman finds the exit of his artificial world, the director tries to convince Truman to stay by telling him that the world he has been living in is better than the real world but Truman decides to leave anyways. The message behind this is a strong one and the movie did a good job of getting it's message across."
"""It's a good movie, I guess, but once you leave the theater, that's it, it's over."" But if you really do want more of that paranoic fun of watching reality unravel you can read this story:""Time Out of Joint"" by Philip K. Dick Synopsis: Ragle Gumm was living with his sister and her family in 1959 solving newspaper puzzles. But his normal life began to change one day, and he noticed things getting really strange. He thought he was losing his mind. But, instead, he was going sane, and the year was 1996."
"I stopped watching tv for two weeks after I saw The Truman Show, and now I try not to watch anything other than the news or movies.  Jim Carrey CAN act in a drama, and he was simply incredible in this movie."
"The Truman Show could have been so good.  There were good intentions behind it and clearly some people with huge ability working on it.  The problem was that though it pretended it was treating the audience as an intelligent entity it took the typical Hollywood attitude of presuming that after all that we would not think about this film.The subject matter demands that as we leave the cinema we must think about the questions that have been asked of us.  To what extent is the media dominating or commanding our lives, do we live to see other's manipulated, is what around us real or a projection of our imaginations (however sick and warped that may be).  All very well, in fact excellent.  Too few films ask us to question the world around us.  But this is where we run into problems. You see, once you start thinking about the film you realise quite how many holes there are in the plot.Forgive me but I would presume that if a man is brought up in a fake world he would never know it was fake because it wasn't fake to him.  For Truman Burbank there can be no real world because in reality to him everything outside the TV studio which is his reality is fake.  Forgive me if I'm not explaining myself clearly enough.  Let me put it like this.  If all your life the rain simply followed you about and did not touch others would you question it.  The answer is no because that is the way things are for you.For Truman to one day start thinking this is a bit weird is not only unlikely and out of character, it could never happen.  Similarly he would not only not find it odd that people around were constantly advertising products, he would adopt that speech pattern himself.  Ultimately this would lead to the failure of the show itself because Truman would no longer be a real man to the viewers, instead he would be more like a trained monkey performing tricks.  But this is straying from the point (though it does demonstrate how examination of the film proves how badly thought through it is).Now onto a second complaint, why is it that the people around Truman have no feelings for him?  They have grown up with him, gone through life with him. Yes, I accept he is their life line but I find it hard to believe that a man who has played his best friend for the best part of 30 years cannot care for him in the slightest.  Not even his 'parents' seem to have any real interest in his wellbeing, despite the fact that they have brought him up as if he were their own.  Are the makers of this film so cynical that they cannot give even the smallest amount of humanity to these characters?I have several other problems with the film, particularly the ending which was one of the most utterly contrived moments on film I have ever seen, as well as the lack of scope given to the show's creator, Christof (easily the best thing in it) and the unnecessary 'love interest.'  However, the major flaw of this film was the idea behind it.  It was so good that I don't think anyone really stopped to think out the complexities before making it.It is such a shame because what could have been so good turned out to be so bad."
There are two types of moviegoers.. people who like this movie and intelligent people. This is the most overrated movie I have ever seen. The story is so poorly done it's a crime. I am truly shocked so many people like this movie. The scene where Ed Harris talks to Jim Carrey like he's god is the true low point of this film and a perfect example of why this movie isn't good.
"I liked the premise of the film: A boy is raised from infancy in a controlled environment for the benefit of, NOT SCIENCE, but for the benefit of a rapt television audience. The possibilities were there for tremendous tension and confrontation. However, what we got was a feel-good, cop-out ending of such massive proportion that I literally felt like shaking the filmmakers and saying, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?SPOILERS AHEAD
The main reason for my wrath was the ending. If you have not seen the film, you are duly warned to stop reading here.We are supposed to cheer for Truman along with the television audience as he finds the doorway to freedom. I felt that to be a MAJOR cop-out. Truman needed to confront the people who turned his entire life into a lie. I wanted to see him confront his ""so-called"" best friend who lied to Truman POINT-BLANK. Where was the payback? Where was the justice? Where was the ethical outrage? We get humorous scenes of ""Free Truman"" factions attempting to alert Truman to his plight, but does Truman ever make anyone feel bad for what they did to him? Christof certainly felt justified in his approach, as did all of the paid actors AND the TV audience. But, if I was Truman, I'd use the opportunity to teach Christof, the actors, AND the TV audience a lesson about how to treat people. But it was an opportunity squandered.In my opinion, there were only 2 good characters in the film: Truman, and the woman he loved. Other than that, EVERY OTHER CHARACTER lies to Truman. EVERY OTHER CHARACTER deceives Truman. There needed to be some satisfactory confrontation, but there wasn't. It was the most empty feeling I've ever had watching a movie. I only rated it on film quality and not script content because the film is actually very artfully executed.But my point is this: Escape (in this case, Truman's) sometimes isn't enough. You sometimes must teach those who wronged you a lesson. You must show them the error in their ways, and those responsible should pay dearly for their moral and ethical transgressions. This movie THOROUGHLY disappointed me."
"My Rating : 9/10If you've ever wondered whether your life is just one big sitcom, The Truman Show illustrates what happens when one man, played by Jim Carrey, realizes that his entire life is scripted for television.A thoroughly enjoyable movie and one of my favourite Jim Carrey movies.Truly thought-provoking!"
"Cliched, simpleton nonsense. That Jim Carrey was able to tone his   Ace Ventura act down to moderately annoying, as opposed to the usual extremely annoying, is not enough to warrant nods for acting. Coupled with a script that borders on Made-For-Tv fare, the result is painful to watch."
"I have never liked Jim Carey's humor. I have found it to very broad and boorish. However, I was very happy that I saw ""The Truman Show"" and am surprised I did considering my feelings about his earlier 'comedies'. Thankfully, Carey showed he could act and NOT ham it up--a tribute to his native talents as well as the director and writer. With a weak director, Carey might have begun to seek laughs in 1001 crazy ways. Here, however, it's straight and quite endearing. I could talk about the plot, but there are already a bazillion reviews for this one. The bottom line is that don't assume because you don't like ""Dumb and Dumber"" or ""Ace Ventura"" you won't love this film. And, I really loved ""The Truman Show"" and think it's a lovely film with a lot of heart and an awful lot of imagination.By the way, I would say the same things about Will Farrell and Adam Sandler. Despite disliking some of there very broad films, there serious films (such as ""Reign Over Me"" or ""Stranger Than Fiction"") are exceptional. Additionally, I gotta admit that I did enjoy a few of their 'stupid' films such as ""Water Boy"" and ""Talladega Nights"". So don't assume that just because you may not like a few of their films means they all are not your cup of tea."
"The Truman Show is a satirical comedy-drama with a cast includes Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank, as well as Laura Linney, Noah Emmerich, Ed Harris and Natascha McElhone. The film chronicles the life of a man who is initially unaware that he is living in a constructed reality television show, broadcast around the clock to billions of people across the globe. Truman becomes suspicious of his perceived reality and embarks on a quest to discover the truth about his life.It was written by Andrew Niccol and directed by Peter Weir.Truman Burbank is unaware that his entire life is a hugely popular 24- hour-a-day TV series. Every moment of his existence is captured by concealed cameras and telecast to a giant global audience. His friends and family are actors who smile pleasantly at Truman's familiar catchphrase greeting, ""In case I don't see you later, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!"" Employed at an insurance company, he is married to merry Meryl, and they live in the cheerful community of Seahaven, an island where the weather is always mild and no unpleasantness intrudes. This is the basic situation of the series, which has grown over the years into a billion-dollar franchise for the TV network. As an unwanted pregnancy, Truman was adopted by the network and raised in the zoolike environment of a TV soundstage. Thus, the TV audience became hooked when Truman was very young. Now, at age 30, he still doesn't know he's a prisoner on an immense domed city-size soundstage, simulating Seahaven. Both the illusion and the ratings will collapse if Truman ever leaves Seahaven. In addition to elaborate events staged to make sure he stays put, Truman is given constant reminders of how wonderful Seahaven is compared to dangers in other parts of the world. However, his growing suspicions make him curious enough to try to leave, and the show's director and master manipulator Christof (Ed Harris) must constantly devise ways to thwart Truman's escape attempts. To enter the harbor, Truman must overcome his fear of water.This is a funny, tender, and thought-provoking film.It is noteworthy for its remarkably prescient vision of runaway celebrity culture and a nation with an insatiable thirst for the private details of ordinary lives.The issues it tackles are just as relevant now than they were when the film was first released theatrically.Also,it has great performances from the cast especially from Jim Carrey in what may be the performance of his career."
"""The Truman Show"" is an absolutely amazing film that transcends beyond the boundaries of conventional moviemaking and storytelling.  I remember coming out of the theater the night I saw it not knowing how to feel.  Should I laugh?  Should I cry?  Be happy or sad?  It was unbelievable!  The idea of a man's whole life being televised and scripted is certainly an original and creative one, and on the whole, an upsetting one.  It's hard for me to watch Truman Burbank, brilliantly played by Jim Carrey, suffer and be so blatantly deceived and lied to by those he crosses and even lives with.  He doesn't know that his whole life wasn't under his control, until things in the show don't quite go as planned.  A piece of equipment from the set falls from the sky, Truman bumps into his dead father who wandered into the set, and he learns his wife actually hates him.  What really upset me about the film was having to watch all those actors and actresses lie, betray, and deceive Truman.  Worse yet, the fans of the show are cold hearted and cruel enough to keep watching, even at the peak of Truman's suffering.  Of course, that's what people do with movies and TV, watch people go through their trials and tribulations, pains and sufferings.  The only difference here is that the star of the show isn't pretending.  Luckily, he takes action and initiates an escape, while the shows creator battles to keep him on the set.  Finally, in a devastating scene, Truman comes to terms with reality, that he never had a life.  Thankfully, it was redeemed when he proudly walked out of the set and ventured out into the world.  What you may not know is that ""The Truman Show"" is actually a film about God.  The creator's name is Christof, related to Christ, and he orchestrates every day of Truman's life.  ""Don't worry about tomorrow, because God has already taken care of it for you."" Also, I didn't think Christof was playing God.  I thought it a satirical way, he really was God.  He was the creator of a show that ""gave hope, joy, and inspiration to millions"", as did God with the world and his son Jesus. His wrath and anger was inflicted upon Truman when he tried to leave the set, or the Garden of Eden, and learn the truth about his life, thus receiving the fruit of knowledge.  Christof throws a violent, Biblical storm at Truman, and after Truman survives the storm, he screams out ""Is that the best you can do?"", on his sailboat the Santa Maria, or the Holy Mary.  The ultimate is the ending, where Truman appears to be walking on water towards the stairway to Heaven, not knowing if he is dead or alive or if it's reality or nightmare.  Christof speaks to Truman through the clouds in a deep, God-like voice, telling him that he has been watching him his whole life.  Another aspect of Christof's God-like qualities is that he isn't actually evil, and all he wants is to do what he thinks is best for Truman. ""In my world, you have nothing to fear.""  A couple of times in the film, Christof pets Truman on the TV screen, a sign of gentleness and love. Finally, Truman gracefully bows before God and walks out of the set, and into the unknown world, thus Adam and Eve leaving the Garden of Eden and venturing out into the real world.  The whole awesome power of the climax brought tears to my eyes on more than one occasion.  It's the first time in my life that a film could have such a strong, inspirational impact on me. It really shook me up!  I was deeply upset that this film got a disappointing 2 Academy Award nomination, neither of which won.  Jim Carrey wasn't nominated, although looking back on his career as the rubberfaced maniac who talked out of his ass in Ace Ventura, it's amazing that he was even involved in such an earth shattering film, let alone play the main character.  But he did it.  He gave Truman a likeable, intelligent, curious, and sad quality.  I remember seeing the trailer for the first time in theaters and thinking, ""Oh boy.  Another Jim Carrey comedy.""  How wrong I was!  This film was a serious, provocative, and inspirational one that put away all the laughter with the exception of the man in the bath tub.  I remember desperately trying not to cry at the climax, watching Truman bang on the wall of the set, learning in a painful instant, the reality of his life.  What would have been really sad is if he never escaped, although an ending like that would be pointless, because the message and the meaning would be lost.  Hopefully, the AFI(American Film Institute) will put this on their list as one of the best films ever made, which I strongly would stand up for and believe it to be true in every sense of the word!"
"What we have here is a film with great potential. Potential to become one of the great dystopian films. It raises such themes as a nation obsessed by television, the means used to provide people their purile ""entertainment"" without any consideration of ethics nor human dignity. Truman could be a great tragedy. We could see one man live a meaningless life, forever watched by millions of big brothers, completely unaware of his fishbowl existence. A warning, pointing to the disconnect and disassociation we all experience upon seeing someone on a television screen. And also to our slavish instinct to glorify these people without knowing why we adore them.And I can't help but think of this when I see all the thousands of mediocrities line up to make complete fools of themselves on national TV on so-called ""reality"" shows all in the name of a few brief and unmemorable moments of ""fame"". We've been brainwashed by the media into believing that fame it itself, is a desirable virtue.But this movie, instead of exploring these issues in depth, skirts around them, afraid of giving itself intellectual depth and weight. Instead were treated to Jim Carey's charming smile and empty acting. This film has the potential to be a memorable and in-depth dystopian vision of fame and the media. Instead, out of pure cowardice, its turned into another meaningless popcorn movie. A complete waste of celluloid. All the people involved in this should be ashamed of themselves."
"What I liked about The Truman Show was the setting and the cinematography.  The production values are good, which sometimes impresses me more than it should.  At least in this case the resulting sense of realism is very satisfying.But the story seemed muddled and pointless, Truman goes through a random process of discovery, and then breaks free.  So what? Can it be possible that the message of this movie is that we watch too much TV? That many of us have trouble distinguishing entertainment from reality?  That everything in life is an illusion?  If it isn't one of these hoary platitudes, what is it?  Even when someone suggested that the movie is an updated version of the escape from the Garden of Eden, and so probably has something to do with loss of innocence, I still end up asking ""So what?""  There's a dorm-room earnestness about The Truman Show that left me cold.  You might love it.  It's definitely worth a try.The Truman Show may be like Citizen Kane, a movie that everyone knows is great but that hardly anyone asks for at the video rental store except extreme cineastes."
"When the movie started I hoped I'd see a movie that utilized the potentiality of what this kind of plot has: Finding that your whole life was one big lie - and the emotional crisis that follows it. Alas, that was not to follow - I hoped the movie would go on from the point Truman successfully escaped the place, but instead the movie ended.I was dismayed that the director didn't realise what great potentiality the movie would had if we could see the emotions Truman would go thru when he finds the Real World(Tm). One would go insane from going from a safe haven to a more unfriendlier and tough world, which would be very interesting to see - and give the movie a much more emotional edge! Which is a shame, because at its current form it does not live up to the hype it had back then."
"No phrase can really explain this movie. The idea of having a man grow up in a 50's sitcom-style universe without him knowing it and then show it as a TV-show 24 hours a day is a somewhat perverted idea but everybody in this movie seems to eat it up. It is not that I am against movies with questionable morals but it seems the situation the main character, Truman is in gives everybody some kind of unexplainable Ecstasy. They are almost slobbering at the screen and all they are really seeing is a person who does pretty much what we all do every day.It might seem like an odd way to start this commentary but I can't for the life of me think of a better way. This is no ordinary movie and the premise is somewhat unusual but still I don't know why it is supposed to be so brilliant. A man is followed around by cameras all day and night and doesn't know it. All well and good. But why does the he have to live in a totally artificial universe where everybody he knows is a fake? And why does Christof believe that he is God because he controls the destiny of one man? When Truman begins to suspect that something is wrong, Christof will destroy everything he has created to keep Truman in the universe which no longer exists because Truman has become aware of it.To say that this is a entertaining film would be stretching the truth. If it is an educational film it doesn't teach me anything. Am I supposed to think TV is bad? Please. Why use a movie then to teach the lesson. Am I supposed to think people are drones who follow every direction which is shoved down their throats? Then why sohw it in a movie which is supposed to sell tickets bought by the same people. All these questions and many more will probably not be answered by the filmmakers or anyone else in the next episode."
"Excruciating.It has so little to say and takes so long to say it, this movie give you a good idea of what watching ""The (real) Truman Show"" must be like. Maybe because I had heard about it before seeing it, I expected some profound insights from this movie.Nope.My friends pretty much covered it all when they told me, ""It's about a guy whose life is a TV show, and everyone knows except him."" Intriguing idea. I kept waiting for more, but it never came. At least Jim Carrey is fun to watch."
"I think this is a fantastic film. It is one of my favorites. I think it is funny, touching and even sad. You can't help but feel badly for poor Truman when he starts discovering things aren't what they seem. I think my absolute favorite line in this movie is from Christof when he said ""Cue the sun"". Sure, maybe its impossibly expensive to build an entire town inside a sphere and create a TV show about a persons life without them knowing it. But when was the last time you saw the Star Ship Enterprise (or Voyager) flying over earth ? Its a great fantasy movie, thats all it is. The acting in this movie is superb, especially that of Jim Carry and Ed Harris. Ed Harris' character is so evil, the way he thinks he knows what's best for Truman. One line he says ""I am the creator...(pause)....of a television show that brings hope and joy to millions"" Its almost as if he has a God complex. Well, I think he does. I have to wonder, if such a show actually aired, where a persons life was on the air 24/7 from infancy to adult, would we actually watch it ?"
"Interesting premise of television programming focused on one man (Carrey) who is unaware of his prominence.  I enjoyed the movie more the first time than the second, I'm not sure it holds up very well to scrutiny.  Plot takes itself too seriously and hits you over the head with the concept;  also, Carrey's unawareness of his situation is a little too much to swallow. Worth a shot but don't expect too much."
"There's a point at which some works of fiction ask you to convert the ""willing suspension of disbelief"" which we must bring to any fictional work into ""throwing all critical faculties completely to the winds"", and that's what happens here. This film is mildly entertaining for a while..until you start actually thinking about some of what it asks you to take for granted. 1. Weather on demand. While we've all seen wave making pools, has anyone actually seen the technology to create violent localized storms? (While there are some who claim the ""secret"" government has such weather control technology, even they supposedly can only do it over a large area.) On a sound stage, this could only have been done with giant fans and large, obvious water-spewing machinery. Where were the fans and the other machinery? Or are we supposed to believe all that weather just came out of thin air? 2. Ventilation. With all the car exhaust and heat generated by the community and the artificial lighting, there obviously would have to be giant air conditioning systems (remember, the dome was supposed to be a closed, sealed location) to dissipate the heat and provide fresh air. Where were all the giant vents that would've been needed? The a/c equipment? The constant noise that large a/c equipment generates? 3. Wouldn't Truman have noticed that there were never any airplanes or helicopters seen flying anywhere? Wouldn't he have asked ""why don't we have any aircraft here?"" I can't think of any ""excuse"" for that which would have been even remotely plausible. 4. For this ""community"" to have gone on so long, it would've meant that all of Truman's ""schoolmates"" weer actors who grew up there along with him. Does anyone really think that so many children (actors, no less) could have kept such a big secret for so many years? Come on, now! You can bet that more than one kid over all that time would've felt the need to spill the beans. 5. Laura Linney's character was initially shown as a cheerleader. That means that the island's high school played competitive sports with other schools. So...does that mean they NEVER played an ""away"" game?? Wouldn't Truman have thought that to be a little strange? And would all of the opposing team's athletes have agreed to be bought off and keep silent? How much money would it have cost to buy the silence of those kids, in addition to all of those mentioned in 4. above? No t.v. show would have been able to marshal the huge budget necessary to pull all of this off on an ongoing basis -- not to mention the huge budget just to pay all of the hundreds of actors. 6. All t.v., radio, magazines, newspapers, movies and internet (yes, internet existed when this movie was made) coming to the island would have had to be censored of any references to The Truman Show. There's no way a t.v. network would be able to exercise such total control. Truman would have noticed that the only media were locally generated. Wouldn't he have asked why he was cut off from everything else? 7. Even if the supposed explanation that he was adopted by a corporation was valid, the moment he was restrained from free movement of any kind the corporation (and thus Christof) was committing the felony of kidnapping -- a federal crime which wouldn't have been excused. 8. There were even internal inconsistencies..e.g., ""Christof"" said in the Harry Shearer interview that all revenues for the show were generated by product placement. If that's so, then why did ""Meryl"" have to hold up various products to the camera and deliver spiels? 9. We're supposed to believe that ""Meryl"" was so upset by some of the manifestations of Truman's waking-up process that she breaks into tears and claims she ""can't work under these conditions, it's not professional"". But at the same time, we're supposed to believe that living for years in a sham marriage with a man she doesn't love (and presumably, routinely having sex with him) was perfectly okay with her, simply because it was a paid gig! That's pretty cold, even for Hollywood."
"The Truman Show is easily one of the most overrated movies of the 1990s. While the premise is excellent, and a number of the supporting performers (especially Laura Linney and Noah Emmerich) do well in their roles, in any star-oriented film, the final judge of the movie's quality must be the star. Jim Carrey ultimately fails to deliver.  In yet another example of his unique, non-acting acting style, he manages to miss (or overshoot?) moments many other actors of lesser stature would hit dead on.  What could have been a very powerful movie dealing with the pressures of life and the changes of aging is ultimately reduced to a hollow, meaningless study of its star. Since the material does not allow Jim Carrey to do that at which he truly excels--outrageous physical comedy--he looks and feels very stiff and very miscast.  Watch the movie, if you can, for its interesting plot, sets, and supporting performances, but try to ignore Jim Carrey's non-performance."
"Let's not delude ourselves that THE TRUMAN SHOW is all that iconoclastic , prophetic or mind blowing original . In the late 1960s Nigel Kneale wrote a BBC teleplay called THE YEAR OF THE SEX OLYMPICS where very similar ideas are explored so the central plot of a man having his whole life manipulated and broadcast to billions of watching people isn't all that clever if you're familiar with the works of Nigel Kneale I have to confess that while this movie was released in 1998 a couple of years before reality TV saturated the airwaves of western television i had never seen it until a couple of days ago which means my view of this movie especially its plot is prejudiced by a force fed television diet of ordinary people going about their lives so the idea that billions of people watching a man selling insurance comes across as totally ridiculous to me . We've seen BIG BROTHER become a parody of itself ( And has been parodied in the recent series of DOCTOR WHO ) while other similar shows have suffered from slipping ratings and critical backlash . So it seems ridiculous that billions of people across the globe are compelled to watch a mundane real life show for thirty years Not to be totally negative what the producers have done with THE TRUMAN SHOW is structure it correctly where it's revealed from the outset that Truman Burbank is unwittingly living inside a massive TV studio . If the story had been constructed as a M Night Shymalan type mystery where it's revealed to the audience at the end that it's all a television show this would have been a disaster , can you imagine the word of mouth giving away the ending ? Without hammering it home there is a logic to the motives of producing a show like this - Product placement , and Jim Carrey gives a restrained performance and makes Truman a sympathetic character . But if it's mind blowing prophesy and social commentary you desire then I'm afraid THE TRUMAN SHOW is inferior to THE YEAR OF THE SEX OPLYMPICS"
"I saw this with my friend as a two movie double. We walked out of Can't Hardly Wait feeling sore from laughing so hard at how hilarious and great it was, into The Truman Show.The pain quickly got worse, but not in a happy, laughing way. I expected this movie to be a great piece of cinematic history, but the truth is, I was almost asleep by the end.I would have to say that the thing that annoyed me most about this movie was that NOTHING HAPPENED. Honestly, I didn't find it exciting at all. I know that it wasn't supposed to be an Ace Ventura bum-talking movie; I was prepared for drama, but it was just one big let-down."
"This is a good movie, and it could've been great, though unfortunately it wasn't.For one, the idea for the story was thought-provoking, intriguing. Too bad they didn't make the most out of it ... that's the feeling I got somehow. I felt it could've been better. Maybe it was the way it was written. Who knows.The acting was, well, ... it was fine enough, though I can't honestly say that it was wonderful, because I've seen a lot more which was better. Ed Harris was good, and Jim Carrey was OK. I guess perhaps all those rave reviews came because people got a revelation with another side of Jim Carrey in this movie, but I think he still has a long way to go. Still, this is a good start!This is a good movie, though it could've been great. Too bad it wasn't ... Anyway, we can hope for better movies. Get another great idea. Then make it !!!!!!!! The Truman Show got the first one down, now we need movies which follows up both."
This movie is not a reflection about the invasiveness of television: this is a movie on a man who discovers (quite quickly in fact) that his own life is a TV show and decides to escape. The movie is just the history of how he tries and succeeds to escape. A really bad movie.
I thought this movie was over rated.  Once you realize what is going on the movie gets real dull.  The idea that someone grew to adulthood without ever leaving the town is ridiculous.  With all the hype I thought it would be much better.   A more entertaining movie with a TV theme is Ed TV.
"A wonderful concept, highly original, but unfortunately, poorly implemented. The sets are good and Jim Carrey's as good as he ever was, though.  You just feel when you leave the cinema that something was missing.  No real beginning and no real end."
This is one of those movies that stand the test of time. A great premise with great actors. The only slight disappointment for me was the ending.
"After watching The Truman Show I found that it is a great film for people of all ages. It is both a comedy and a drama, so everyone can get something out of it no matter what they like. Although there is some language, most of the movie is pretty family friendly. It also has a great message about reality TV. One thing you should look out for though is that the ending scene is very intense and may give children nightmares. There is some profanity including the sh-- word, hell, and godd---. Although these are very few points in the film and I'm sure no child would pick it up."
"I was one of a great many people who saw this movie and were blown away at how original it was.Then, a few nights ago, while flipping channels, I caught the last five minutes of an episode of Twilight Zone, The (1985). The episode (I've learned after digging a little) was titled ""Special Service"" and was episode 3.27, airing in 1988. It concerns a regular guy who discovers that his entire life has been orchestrated and broadcast as a cable TV show.I guess it just goes to show that all of us who thought, ""Man, what a Twilight-Zone concept that movie was!"" were more right than we could have known!Grade: 7 out of 10. Good. Worth seeing, but once will probably do."
"I remember hearing the briefest of synopsis of 'The Truman Show' in a film magazine that was promoting the next year's upcoming movies. It just read, 'Jim Carrey discovers he's a character in a TV show.' I have to say that that description hardly blew me away as I didn't know what to make of it. Saying it like that makes it sound much more simple and goofy than it really is. I didn't go and see it when it was theatrically released, but after the positive word of mouth it generated, I felt I had to see it for myself.I can't really sum it up any better. Jim Carrey slowly discovers that the world around him is one giant TV set and he's the (unwitting) star, as cameras have been following his life ever since his birth. It was actually a pretty novel concept back in 1998. 'Big Brother' and various other reality TV shows had not yet taken over our airwaves, making this film quite ahead of its time.Carrey plays, 'Truman Burbank,' a happy-go-lucky fella who slowly starts to realise that there's something very wrong with the world and its inhabitants who exist all around him. From there, he slowly begins to unravel the plot for himself. It's all great fun and you really want to root for Truman to succeed in escaping this 'prison/goldfish bowl' he exists in. Jim Carrey is known for his 'larger than life' characters, but I'm pleased to say that he's dialed it down here and is much less manic than his other outings such as 'The Mask' or 'Ace Ventura.'Not just is it a quirky little drama, but it throws in many a dose of healthy social commentary of society and their obsession with television and the characters they spend their lives watching. However, I doubt that the film-makers ever realised how true to life this would all be with the amount of reality TV shows which were to follow it.Personally, I loved it and - despite it being a bit out of date now - I think it holds up perfectly as a warning of our obsession with TV. For what it's worth, I'll mention my friend's thoughts on it. He didn't like it because he thought it was all too far fetched. He felt that if the cameras had been following Truman since birth (approximately thirty years by the time we join him), that would mean the TV show started around 1968 and, back then, studios didn't have the technology to pull this off. I simply disregarded that as a nit-pick. This film is too good to look that deeply into and risk putting yourself off enjoying the ride.I guess I'll leave it up to its 'tagline' to say it best. 'On Air. Unaware.' Well done to the Marketing man who came up with that one!"
"This movie is so underrated. It was really ahead of its time, as I feel its themes and messages are so impactful in todays world. I really love this film and has one of Jim Carrys best performances. Such a great film!"
"Regarded as one of the top rated movies, I was curious to see what made it so good. Knowing the premise, I was interested to see how they were going to justify the story.The film is actually incredibly well set-up, explaining in detail how it was possible for Truman to never explore the world. Jim Carrey is also perfectly cast as Truman, and he completely sold his character to me in a not-so-over-the-top comedic and also somewhat dramatic performance. The more I watched, the more addicted I became - like a soapie. This was the whole idea of the movie and it effectively came across as such.Ed Harris is also great in his role as the film's antagonist. 'The Truman Show' is an interesting concept, and they manage to pull it off perfectly. The film also has a beautiful score. Good ending."
"I was immediately interested when I found out there was a movie with Jim Carrey that wasn't a comedy. His performance is memorable, as we can sympathize with his lifelong struggle to figure out what is real. Basically, an illusory world is built around a man, simply to entertain viewers who watch the live footage of his life. This concept was so fascinating to me, and is even more ironic today, in that we have phones and are always connected with the outside world. Again, Jim Carrey's performance is amazing, the storyline is intriguing, and the direction of photography is top notch. I recommend this for anyone interested in an engaging drama, sci-fi flick."
"Just as a warning before I begin: this review does include spoilers! I personally believe that there are a lot of satirical messages in The Truman Show, but I think the most prominent is that the media is used to display people's lives in whatever way they please. The Truman Show targets the media, and displays the problem of media manipulation. This idea is exaggerated by Truman being the media's subject matter without consent for every moment of his life. We see this in real life with celebrities in paparazzi photos and reality TV shows, although, contrary to Truman, celebrities are aware that the world has their eyes on them. Throughout the movie, we see the producers of the show plant subject matter into Truman's life, such as his father coming back to life, or all the advertising for hot chocolate. This can show how the media manipulates people. In the movie, the inhumaneness of Truman's situation is deflated. The movie is ironic because Truman's audience knows that he's on television, but Truman does not. I really enjoyed this movie, especially after having realized the satirical messages hidden within it."
"The Truman Show is an incredible and incredibly surreal film that shows the manipulation of the media. It's both heartbreaking and heartwarming. Jim Carrey gives a perfect performance with great supporting performances from Ed Harris and Laura Linney. Peter Weir's direction is incredible and the music by Burkhard Dallwitz is also great. However, the ending felt slightly abrupt and could have kept going for a bit longer."
"Jim Carrey is an odd one isn't he. Much loved for his slapstick stylings, I've never really warmed to that side of him. The Truman Show is different. Yes there's Carrey's silly side, but here it makes perfect sense in his fictional world with every detail dialled up to eleventy-stupid. It's the sinister underbelly that's that lights the touch-paper though, it's ridiculously troubling, taking a baby, putting him on camera, cutting him off from the real world and fabricating a picket fence utopia without his consent or knowledge. It's the knowledge factor that's key for Truman, not his lack of, but his thirst for. This is Ed Harris' world, his character Cristof's idea of utopia and as Truman grows up, he outgrows the godlike creators vision. Sure there's love too, a longing for someone, but Truman is an explorer, it's in his soul and can't be contained or controlled. It's a film full of spirit, as well as chuckles and twilight zone drama, but it's the rooting for the underdog urge that makes me love this so much. Maybe we see ourself here somehow, don't we all sometimes imagine ourselves as the star in our own show and what is real in our consumer world anyway. ""We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented"", but we all know what's real and what's fake... well just about. This is a fun film, a simple premise, yet feeling utterly original and as over the top and grand as the world it displays. It's cinematic to the core, even boasting a Philip Glass score and is probably my favourite Carrey film (although Eternal Sunshine is great). A joyous ride to the end, with genuine heart in mouth moments. ""Was nothing real?""... well who knows!"
"The Truman Show is a film I never got around to watching until now, despite having heard references to it here and there over the past ... twenty years?! Now that I have seen it, I am somewhat glad that I waited, because from this vista, twenty years later, it really seems prophetic. Think about all of the children who were born after the ascendance of the internet. Many of their lives are not unlike Truman´s life: every moment captured for all the world for all of time.What is even more disconcerting is that many people willingly choose to focus on and cultivate their internet presence at the expense of everything else. We have become a selfie culture, and reality t.v. thrives because people not only like to watch other people but also to put themselves and their lives on display. Modern people have become narcissistic exhibitionists--and are proud of it!"
"It's not coincidental that the main hero was named Truman, as he is the only true and sincere man in a movie. Jim Carrey in the leading role of Truman Burbank gave a very convincing performance, as well as the supporting cast created the unforgettable images and outlined the contrast. This masterpiece is highly recommended to watch."
"Story of Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) a man who has lived his entire life on TV without ever knowing it, everyone he has ever known was an actor and everything in his life has been scripted. Broadcast 24 hours a day from hundreds of hidden cameras in the largest television studio in the world and using a cast and crew of thousands. This is the ultimate satire of life in a media fishbowl. While he has been provided with an almost perfect existence, Truman is not entirely happy and he has begun to suspect that something is going on around him and that things may not be what they seem.This is also the story of the audience and their dependence on this real life soap opera that has been broadcast everyday for over 10,000 straight days, and finally it is a story about the media as personified by Christof (Ed Harris) who has become the ultimate manipulator of life.At the heart of the picture we have a well told story from screenwriter Andrew Nichol who would be nominated for an Oscar and directed by Peter Weir also Oscar nominated and one of his 6 Oscar nominations (four of which were for Direction. Both plot and character are given considerable attention here so we follow incidents but also the affects these developments have upon the characters.The title role is well played by Carrey who gives his most restrained performance up to that time, Laura Linney gives another strong supporting performance and Ed Harris seems perfectly cast as the creator and master manipulator of this all encompassing media event, and for which he would be Oscar nominated."
"I asked a friend to describe The Truman Show. He said, ""No, it's not a comedy, well...not exactly."" I didn't quite understand until I watched it myself. Truman takes on a tone quite different than any parody/comedies I've seen lately. The point (the media and its destructive powers) is subtlely relayed through dark humor, and you don't feel like the director is smashing you over the head with his morals. Peter Weir demonstrated his artistic genius in Dead Poets Society and here as well. The soundtrack is great, Ed Harris is stellar (what were they THINKING at the Academy?) and for once I actually liked Jim Carrey. His performance wasn't ribald for once. The final scene--I will not reveal it--is a majestic, long-awaited finish to an intellectual movie. Some people will insist that it was boring or pointless. Those are the same viewers who prefer slapstick, obvious humor to the subtle layers presented here. This is a thinking person's movie. If you can't see the underlying message here, of course you won't like it!"
"As many fans know, Jim Carrey is the man when it comes to slapstick comedy. His comical physicality is outrageous and his ability to emulate anything from cartoons to other actors is top notch. But anytime before 1998 I think I can safely say that not many people saw Carrey try and jump out of his shell and try a role that wasn't truly in the comedy genre. I definitely didn't see it coming. And to be honest, I wasn't sure if I would really enjoy it. But in the end, I did, not only because of how well Carrey portrayed his character but with an excellent story to back if up."
"This movie talks about a person named Truman who is being fooled because he thought that what he's seeing and the world he's living in is his real world. Unfortunately, he doesn't know that he's the most famous person in the world and he's life is a television show being played live for 24 hours without interruptions like commercial and such. He's actually living a life full of lies. He doesn't even got the chance to live as the person he really is. This movie is amazing and breathtaking because of the scenes. This will make you realize that not everything you see is real. This also shows how technology and media affects a persons' life. On the audience perspective who's been watching Truman for decades, the Truman show seems realistic because of the scenery, the place, sky and the settings. The ending left us all hanging because we doesn't have an idea what happened when Truman already left the studio and got to see the real world and Lauren, the love of his life. This is a must watch movie. The efforts of the cast and staff is worth it because the result of the movie is successful."

It's like his whole life is a lie. Lol. This movie is amazing. This movie makes you realize that not everything you see is real. This also shows how technology and media can affect a person's life. Also, when you're the audience of that television show and you're going to review it, on the audience perspective, the television show seems realistic because the scenery, the place, the sky and everything that you see in that show looks real. This is a must watch movie. The efforts of the cast and staff is worth it because you can see that the movie is successful."
