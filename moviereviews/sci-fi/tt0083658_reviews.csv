"A feast for the eyes. Dark and uncompromising. With a haunting musical score by Vangelis that adds a hypnotic quality to those breathtaking megacity landscapes of future Los Angeles. Ridley Scott's adaptation of Philip K. Dick's post-apocalyptic bounty hunter story 'Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep' is a visionary work of art; it's a dystopian masterpiece and I'd personally call it as much a milestone of science fiction as Kubrick's '2001' (and be advised to watch the version known as the ""final cut"" if you want to catch 'Blade Runner' as it was intended by its director). It's hard to overstate how influential the film was; it invented the sci-fi subgenre now known as ""cyberpunk"", and it was also the first ""film noir"" in a sci-fi setting. And although it looks so distractingly gorgeous that even today there are people who still dismiss it as superficial and mere ""eye candy"", it is a philosphically deep film that ponders existential questions about the nature of being human. Its slow, brooding quality will perhaps leave some modern audiences who are used to a different pace and more action underwhelmed - but make no mistake: this is a groundbreaking masterwork of its genre and a timeles classic. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/"
"Dark, deep, uncertain, unsettling  imagine the most beautiful nightmare you've ever had  this is Blade Runner (1982).Ridley Scott's Blade Runner is a brilliantly crafted science fiction film that not only touches upon, but bravely plunges into deep philosophical questions, making it simply ten times more important than any film of its genre. I love it not only for the initial feeling it gives, but because of its perseverance  none of the visuals, themes or technology feel dated but as deep, gripping and current as ever. It is timeless beauty with huge doses of emotion.Set in 2019 Los Angeles, Blade Runner zooms in on the eerily-lit, urban streets of the city and follows Richard Deckard  superbly played by Harrison Ford who brings an exquisite moral ambiguity to his character  a special policeman who tracks down and terminates artificially-created humans called replicants, who have escaped from an Off-World colony and made their way to earth and need to be stopped. The things Deckard encounters on his detective journey raise many philosophical questions like: Who is really a replicant? Are replicants really bad? If replicants are bad, when why did we go to such lengths with our technology to create them? Are replicants really humans? Is Deckard a hero? This truly is a film that demands subsequent discussion and its ambiguous ending leave a haunting and eerie feeling.In spite of a rich glaze of science fiction and futurism coating this adventure, there are distinct film noir elements present  primarily in the bluish haze that the film is seen through and its gritty urban atmosphere. Whoever thought of this combination is a genius. Since it is all about technology, it fits then that Blade Runner features a ridiculous amount of product placement, especially from Atari. In any other film, this would have felt out-of-place but here it is simply perfect. The score by Vangelis is strangely gripping when combined with the striking cinematography of the film.Blade Runner deserves credit, celebration and remembrance for it is simply an excellent film. 10 out of 10 (and I don't just throw this grade out like SOME people)"
"This is truly one of the greatest science fiction films ever made, one that requires a thinking viewer in order to understand and appreciate it.  The director's cut is the recommended one to see as it omits a somewhat distracting narration and avoids an unnecessary Hollywood-style ending that is at odds with the rest of the film's tone.A true science fiction story or film is about ideas, not spaceship battles, futuristic gadgets, or weird creatures.  ""Blade Runner"" fully qualifies as this in its examination of the impact of technology on human society, existence, and the very nature of humanity itself.  These themes are set in a fairly basic detective story that moves slowly but gradually builds power as the viewer is immersed in a dystopian futuristic Los Angeles.Harrison Ford fans accustomed to the normally dynamic roles that he plays may be dissatisfied with the seemingly lifeless lead character that he portrays here as the replicant-hunting detective known as a ""blade runner"". They should be, for this dissatisfaction is part of the film experience, part of the dehumanized existence in the story's setting.  However, as the story unfolds, we see Ford's character, Rick Deckard, slowly come alive again and recover some humanity while pursing four escaped replicants.The replicants, genetically-engineered human cyborgs, that Deckard must hunt down and kill are in many ways more alive than Deckard himself initially. Their escape from an off-world colony has an explicit self-directed purpose, whereas Deckard's life appears to have none other than his job, one that he has tried to give up.  By some standards, Deckard and the replicants have thin character development.  However, this is a deeply thematic and philosophical film, and as such the characters are the tools of the story's themes.  Each character reflects some aspect of humanity or human existence, but they lack others, for each is broken in ways that reflect the broken society in which they live and were conceived/created.There are several dramatic moments involving life-and-death struggles, but most of these are more subdued than in a normal detective story plot.  The film's power is chiefly derived through its stunning visual imagery of a dark futuristic cityscape and its philosophical themes.Among the themes explored are the following: - The dehumanization of people through a society shaped by technological and capitalistic excess. - The roles of creator and creation, their mutual enslavement, and their role reversal, i.e., the creation's triumph over its creator. - The nature of humanity itself: emotions, memory, purpose, desire, cruelty, technological mastery of environment and universe, mortality, death, and more. - Personal identity and self-awareness. - The meaning of existence.If you are not someone who naturally enjoys contemplating such themes, the film's brilliance may be lost on you.  The climax involves a soliloquy that brings many of the themes together in a simple yet wonderfully poetic way. Anyone who ""gets"" the film should be moved by this; others will sadly miss the point and may prefer watching some mindless action flick instead.""Blade Runner"" is a masterpiece that deserves recognition and long remembrance in film history."
"Blade Runner belongs on a list of 2 or 3 movies that had me walking out of the theater in a stupor as though hit by a sledgehammer, the first time I saw it. It fulfills one of my requirements of great films in that I walked out of the theater a different person than when I entered. And it fulfilled another requirement in that it improved with repeated viewings.There is so much to take in visually, intellectually, and emotionally that my mind was overwhelmed at the first viewing trying to sort it all out. Unlike the so-called ""entertainment"" we get today at the movies, this film didn't spoonfeed its meaning to you. It left the ending ambiguous so your imagination has to supply it.The film demands discussion. There are so many topics to debate. Is Deckard a replicant? Do Deckard and Rachel live happily ever after? Why is there a unicorn in the director's cut? Is Deckard a hero? Or are the replicants really the good guys? Every time I watch it, my answers change.I may be one of the few that really likes the original. Probably because I've seen that version a couple dozen times since 1982 before the director's cut came out. This may contradict what I said earlier about being spoonfed, but I liked the narration because it explained what was going on in Deckard's mind. And I didn't mind the ""happy ending"" because it still implied that their troubles may not be over. ""I don't know how long we had together. Who does?"" But with that version memorized, I now appreciate the directors cut. It probably has the better ending. (At least I think so until I view it again!)It's also fun watching actors before they became more famous later like Sean Young, Daryl Hannah, M. Emmet Walsh, William Sanderson, and Edward James Olmos. I think they all did a great job. And Vangelis did a beautiful, moving score.After ""Blade Runner"", most of the big blockbuster science fiction movies boil down to good guys vs. bad guys with lots of loud explosions and in-your-face effects. Very simplistic messages, if any. That's why I still contend that an ""oldie"" like Blade Runner still outshines them all. It has incredible special effects, but never at the expense of the story. The cityscapes do more than dazzle you, they involve you.The more I think of it, the more I realize that ""Blade Runner"" is not only my favorite science fiction movie, but one of my favorite films in any genre. I wish Ridley Scott would return to science fiction, but then again today's Hollywood would never release a movie like ""Blade Runner."""
"Blade Runner, directed by Ridley Scott and based on Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, is a Sci-fi slash Noir film about a cop named Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) in a decrepit 2019 Los Angeles whose job it is to ""retire"" four genetically engineered syborgues, known as ""Replicants"".  The four fugitives, Pris (Daryl Hannah), Zhora (Joanna Cassidy), Leon (Brion James), and their leader, Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), have escaped from an off-world colony in order to find their creator and bully him into expanding their pre-determined four year life span.  This film originally flopped when it came out in 1982, but since has become a widely acclaimed cult classic with a director's cut to boot.  A large part of the success that this movie has received can be attributed to its ability to operate on many different levels.Ridley Scott's hauntingly possible depiction of what might become of Los Angeles down the line is absolutely brilliant.  It captures elements of Noir with its urban atmosphere of decadence, lighting, and characters neither clearly defined as good nor evil.  Corruption is everywhere.  The garbage-littered streets and permanence of dark and rain give us the sense that we've seriously screwed up the atmosphere, and the impression that all respectable human beings have fled to the off-world colonies, leaving only the scum of the earth behind.There is a hint of style from the 40's, especially with respect to cars, costumes, and music.  Rachael's entire outfit, including her hair, screams the 40's.The soundtrack, arranged by Vangelis (who won an Oscar for his Chariots of Fire score), consisted mainly of Jazz and Blues.  This functioned to represent a dark, moody world of uncertainty and pessimism.The special effects were exceptional.  Much of the set was pulled off using models.  In my opinion, sets made by hand require leagues more of skill and are much more impressive and realistic than those computer generated.  These guys really knew what they were doing.  I was especially fond of the pyramidesque Tyrell Corporation building, which hinted at the god-like presence of Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkell), the creator.The script (Hampton Fancher, David Peoples, and of course Phil Dick) worked for me, as well as the actors who gave voice to it.  Harrison Ford was well...Harrison Ford.  I thought he did a tremendous job down-playing the role.  His voice-over narration helped you along, and was yet another feature conducive to Film Noir (apparently this was taken out of the Director's Cut).  Rutger Hauer's performance was intense.  His lines at the end were intriguingly philosophical.  Daryl Hannah's chilling robotic expressions were quite impressive.  Joanna Cassidy was just plain hot.There is more to this film than just pulp.  It works on so many remarkable levels.  The movie itself is a detective noir quest for the meaning of life in a science fiction environment, but the story is a commentary on what it means to be human and the questions each one of us have about life, like: How long have I to live?  Why do I have to die?  What happens when I die? Doesn't my maker care?  Is this all merely an illusion?  At the end of the film we are left to wonder if these Replicants are human, and if Deckard himself is in fact a Replicant.  Scott raises more questions here than he answers, and as a result, critics are still debating the mysteries of this film today.  In a sense, the ambiguity of Blade Runner is the culprit of its success."
"What can be said about this film that hasn't already been covered in preceding decennia? Blade Runner (either version) stands the test of time as an epic story which transcends a disparity of genres, as well as the seminal ""dark"" sci-fi film which has been mimicked so frequently (to varying degrees of success) since its original release. The interplay of film noir, sci-fi, and what is one of the most philosophically symbolic and academically analyzed narratives of the modern era holds its ground on both visual and cerebral levels even in the face of today's CGI laden blockbusters. The new director's cut, contrary to many cinematic re-hashings, actually serves to clarify many of the more nebulous aspects of the plot and makes a great film even better, arguably allowing it to be modernized and polished for a new generation of viewers who are more picky and yet simultaneously less idealistic. All while sustaining the feeling and flavor of the original. Call it restorative work if you will. The tinny and meandering score by Vangelis is pure 1980s at its most brooding and fits the texture and mood of the film beautifully. Indeed, for many reasons, finding this film in someone's DVD collection makes a true statement about their discriminating and refined taste in movies, and equally their appreciation of film as an artistic medium. I would suggest picking up a reader by someone like Nietzsche, Foucualt, Descartes, Kierkegaard, or any of the great existentialist philosophers after viewing this film in order to appreciate the story & its concepts at a whole new level, regardless if you're watching it for either the 1st, or the 100th time. An enduring classic and an intrepid piece of film-making with rich & often haunting visuals designed to entertain and promote introspection amongst its viewers. 9/10."
"OK, I admit...the first time I watched this movie I detested it. But hey, I was 16 years old and had expected an action-packed sci-fi adventure. Blade Runner is not such a film. But I am grateful for this, for after maturing a bit and rewatching the movie a couple of times, I discovered its greatness. It is not a traditional sci-fi movie, it's a touching drama about the value of life and the importance of making the most of what you've got. One of the most important themes in the film is the question of what is more valuable - humans without emotions, or machines with? The film gives no answer - it just opens our eyes and makes us aware that we should be grateful for being alive.Some people prefer the Director's Cut, but I like the original version better - mostly because of the wonderful end line: ""I didn't know how long we had together. Who does?"" That pretty much sums it up."
"But it's almost like an art movie, the first science-fiction art film It's a futuristic film beautifully put together It's really impeccably made by one of the great visionary directors And you really saw a future that looked very different from the future you had seen before A future that looked very believable like the visual-effects shots of the flying car going over a futuristic city The fight sequence doesn't prepare you for the traumatic emotional side that there is in the film, it leaves you sort of broken There is a beautiful, delicate emotional great scene that I remember when I first saw the movie I'm in the theater and I'm so drawn in what Rutger Hauer's doing I'm so drawn in by what the theme of the movie has brought us to The magnificent moment where he is letting go of life And in those last moments of letting go of life he's really learned to appreciate life to the point where he spares Deckard's life, and where he's even holding a white dove because he just wants to have something that's alive in his hands It's an amazing sort of crescendo that's going and there's Rutger saying: ""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. All these moments will be lost in time like tears in rain."" Hauer puts all the things that are so amazing about people: sense of poetry, sense of humor, sense of sexuality, sense of the kid, sense of soul Scott brought out the best qualities in his performers He coaxed and very gently manipulated performances from his actors that in some instances I think they've rarely topped You feel the story, you feel the emotions of the characters and you will be lost in the middle of this wild world, you know, it's so rich and it's painful I mean it's a very bluesy, dark story and told very compassionately The overpopulation, the sort of crowd scenes is so rich and varied and there's such an extreme detail designing the magazine covers, designing the look of the punks, the Hare Krishnas, the biological salesman, everything is designed You have just Piccadilly Circus punks walking by You have a sense of layers in that society That is one of those things that you see again and again The city landscape with the big billboards à la Kyoto or Tokyo Scott was able to create the look based on what goes on in various cities all over the world Whether it is Tokyo, Kyoto or Beijing or Hong Kong or whatever, you're right in ""Blade Runner"" country ""Blade Runner,"" to me, embodies the elegance, the power, and the uniqueness of a film experience It's the most classical, beautiful, purest movie-making writing and then the film-making itself is The images and the sound and the music, it's pure cinema Ridley came out with an amazing, brilliantly executed future of an absolute dystopia The intensity of his perfectionism on ""Blade Runner"" made the movie This is a master at his best"
"This movie is obscenely over rated. It is clear that ALL the attention was given to the production design and overall look to the film, as the script (no matter the 'version') is awful. For a film so raved about by nearly every critic, the plot is cookie cutter and drab. The pacing is, well, there simply isn't any pacing. It is S L O W. The characters are completely uninteresting and the film isn't deep or genuinely philosophical enough to warrant the attention it asks us to pay. There are many parts that are simply goofy and unintentionally funny, like when Rutger Hauer pops his head through the wall towards the end and says something silly, or when Darryl Hannah could have killed Deckard but instead decides to back up and then do a bunch of goofy gymnastics flips in order to give him time to pick up his gun and blow her ""guts"" out. It is one of my best friend's favorite films and it took a lot out of me to hold my tongue while watching it with him."
"This is a film that is so deep, rich, and multi-layered, it may require more than one viewing to fully absorb the brilliance of what you've just seen. At first glance, it can be a bit slow. It's told in a classic film noir fashion, so this is to be expected. Director Ridley Scott seems to want to savor every shot, and an astute audience will be able to sense this.Now, I say the film is told in a classic Noir style, but this can be misleading. There is no Humphrey Bogart in Blade Runner, snapping off brilliant one-liners once a second. Only hopeless people, in many ways victims of the merciless world of which they are all a part. Deckard is a typically downbeat protagonist, a hard-boiled cynical leading man with a weakness for heavy drinking. The plot is a mystery in name only, as the audience is allowed to know what Roy Batty, Pris and Leon are all up to before Deckard ever finds out. This only lends to the dread and inevitability of the film, lending further to its pervasive gloom. There is no final scene at the end where the bold detective puts all the pieces together and says ""Ah-Ha!"". Instead, we find Rick Deckard questioning his own existence and drinking away his constant doubts, all the while embroiled in a romantic relationship with someone he's sworn to kill.Blade Runner requires audience participation, particularly in the Director's Cut, which is entirely devoid of some rather necessary exposition provided by the Original Cut's much-maligned voice-over. Certain facts will not be clear even at the end of the film, requiring personal interpretation in order to be appreciated fully. Other facts will be given away in much more subtle ways than in most modern cinema, such as through visual cues and tenuous dialogue.Finally, visually, this movie is quite simply a science fiction triumph. It looks better than modern computer effects in every way that counts. Superimposed special effect objects don't give off that unnatural, clearly computer-generated ""Lord of the Rings"" sheen common in today's effects-driven blockbusters. This, of course, is because Blade Runner - while a gorgeous movie - is not effects driven in the least. Rather, it is a visually driven story that doesn't rely on special effects. This is an important distinction to make in today's Hollywood.""Touch of Evil"" really wasn't the last of the Great Film Noirs!"
"This is simply Scott's finest hour. There are a sheer plethora of futuristic films with vision. Films which crudely grope into a possible time ahead,when perhaps a post apocalyptic era is scattered with cliché upon cliché and often miss the whole point. What Ridley Scott achieved with this film,is an entirely possible scenario. It really does feel like a science fiction novel brought to life,but not so much as its derivative penned by Phillip K Dick(do androids dream of electric sheep?). Its a grimy,violent world inhabited by the sick,lower class,villainous second citizens who haven't quite made the grade for the off world colonies. We have a true smelting pot of nationalities.The heavy eastern references within china town like inner cities is particularly poignant.This film also sees Ford in perfect casting.Theirs a rye charm that Ford has that no other actor could fake or fill quite as effortlessly. Its a mixed review depending on what version you have seen. For me,the directors cut is simply too cut. I preferred the audience friendly screening which had the wonderful narration. The finest moment with this narration has to be the moments described by Batty in his dying eyes and the summing up by Ford of this man/machines passion and love for life.. No other sci-fi futuristic film has ever made the grade before or since in my humble opinion. It captured the raw smells and light of a brutal future scarily depicted in films or even so well. From the chase scene with Zora to the flybys over the city capturing a stunning skyline,chimneys and skyscrapers in one shot. This is my favourite movie of all time for all the reasons above and many more i could effortlessly type all day and night."
"There were some buildings and then it rained and it's always dark and Edward James Olmos makes some origami and oh, someone shoots another guy, and then it rained and there was a chick dressed to look like Auntie Mame (look it up) complete with 40's style clothes and then it rained and Harrison Ford is in yet another dimly lit room (they don't have lights in the future?) and then there was a half naked lady (boobies!!) who had on some kinky high heeled boots that suddenly turned in to flats so she could run away in the rain...and it rained and oh wait! For some unknown reason we got some kind of hallucination of a running unicorn with no explanation and then There's Darryl Hannah with bad eye makeup and then it rained and some people said some stuff but none of it was really memorable and then it rained and some some nerd and his self made toy midgets did some stuff and then it rained and then Harrison Ford got into a fight with Rutger Hauer and then it rained and Darryl Hannah did some flips and screamed a lot and then it rained and then there was a white dove and some more rain and that about covers it."
"Blade Runner is perhaps the best sci-fi film and undoubtedly one of the best films of all time. Along with 2001: A Space Odyssey, it is one of the most philosophical and influential movies ever created, as it conveys a plethora of fundamental questions, which are woven in the very fabric of the human essence and existence. It seems near impossible to imagine a more suitable fusion of two of the most successful genres of all time, Science Fiction and Film Noir. By merging together the moral conflict and the emphatic character arc of the private detective, a trait that is exclusive to and definitive of the Film Noir genre, with a futuristic dystopian environment, Blade Runner creates the ultimate Neo-Noir setting, the only one capable of supporting such strong ideas and posing such significant questions to the viewer, without compromising on an interesting plot development and an appealing pace, things that are masterfully achieved via a tight script and persuasive performances.In a dark, future dystopian portrait of a 2019 Los Angeles, where humans have alienated themselves with their true nature and claimed the title of god/creator of life, effectively manufacturing artificial intelligence and bioengineering androids, called ""Replicants"", a retired ""Blade Runner"" named Rick Deckard is assigned with the undertaking of terminating four rogue such replicants that have illegally returned to Earth in a quest to force their maker, Tyrel, into postponing their grim destiny, basically prolonging their already predetermined four-year lifespan. Their greatest sin, however, is having the audacity of desiring one of the most sought-after values in the history of the human species, the freedom to live as they please. In this uneasy and twisted world, the lines between humanness and machinery are blurred and Deckard is faced with the consequences of the realization that not all is as it seems and there is more to ""being-alive"" than most believe. Blade Runner's unique depiction of the future has been imitated numerous times quite unsuccessfully, mostly due to the fact that no other film to this date has managed to create such an engaging atmosphere so beautifully connected to every part of it, effectively enhancing every scene and allowing for a strong conveyance of all the moral and existential questions that are posed during the whole duration. The audience is instantaneously absorbed by the vivid and compelling world depicted in the film, and that's where Ridley Scott succeeds the most, offering a glance into an original and somewhat disturbing reality that might very well be humanity's near future. The cinematography is impeccable, the art direction is gorgeous and along with some of the best visual effects that have ever been used in film-making, creates one of the most realistic and visually stunning environments that have ever graced a motion picture to this day. Vangelis has also composed one of the best and most awe-inspiring scores of all time, effectively managing to capture the very essence of each scene, thus making all sound a significant and inseparable part of the whole cinematic experience that Blade Runner has to offer. This thorough examination of what it means to be human isn't, thankfully, to no avail, as a careful observant, is forced to question their beliefs and attempt to choose a side on dilemmas that are still discussed by philosophers to this day, such as the traits that define humanity, the relativity that characterizes concepts like right or wrong, good or evil, as well as the meaning of life itself. The moral and existential complexity of this reality that Blade Runner has offered to the world reaches depths unparalleled by the majority of the films available, therefore greatly distinguishing it from all others and thus emphasizing its uniqueness through the most complete portrayal of science fiction to date."
"I have an interest in science fiction films and TV programmes. I like shows like (the original) Star Wars trilogy, (most of) the Star Trek films, as well as Star Trek TV series (Voyager for modern times,preferably, as it had the least number of useless episodes), etc. In my experience, most SF material turns out to be distilled garbage. Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' was a masterpiece. I am not hesitant to say that I blatantly dislike Spielberg's definition of SF- ET, Close Encounters, & (worst of all) War Of The Worlds. Neither do I appreciate any 'Alien' film apart from R Scott's 1979 original (although Alien2 was OK)-Alien vs Pred is a disgrace not only to all genres, but to the film industry itself. So when I heard of Blade Runner on the net, I wondered; what could be so good about this film? I have HBO,Cinemax, Star Movies- yet this film has never been shown. So, I got myself the Director's Cut at the local video store. I watched it once. Then I re-watched it two days later. My verdict: This film is fantastic.It is one of the greatest films ever made, on par with 2001: A Space Odyssey. Upon 1st viewing, new audiences may be bewildered. One anticipates a futuristic run-of-the-mill 80's shoot-em-up (in the like of Outland,say). What you get is a film so deep that it is difficult to grasp the 1st time. There is so much symbolism, introverts and questions that I was left stunned. The film is hauntingly beautiful, and I doubt that these screen landscapes could be reproduced today as well as they were here. The plot centres around the question of humanity- something we take for granted. It is not an auctioneer, which was probably what audiences expected when they walked into theatres in the 80s, causing the film to fail commercially. Blade Runner is not for the adrenaline junkie, nor for those who like flashy gadgets and bright explosions, with a healthy Hollywood-made dose of convincing storyline spoon-fed for their satisfaction.The film is set in the apocalyptic, suggestively post-war future Earth, where there seems to be a lag in technology. Perhaps there was a war which ravaged the world, forcing humans to migrate (the cramped cultural richness of LA), and rebuild, explaining the retro technology. 6 'Criminal' Nexus 6 replicates (genetically engineered humanoids), hijack a ship and come to Earth seeking their maker. These slaves(machines/automatons// regard them as anything which has been created by Man to lessen his burden) have developed emotions, and they fear death for they cherish their memories (Think robots weeping over photographs). Their cause: They want a longer life, they want to experience more, they want to be... human.Enter Rick Deckard, Blade Runner. His job: kill trespassing replicates; Kill living, breathing humanoids composed of flesh and blood who only have 4 years to live out their miserable lives, seeking haven on Earth rather than serving as slaves in mining outposts on Mars. Kill? Murder seems more appropriate. But that's his job. replicates which trespass are a hazard. These 6 replicates have killed 23 people and hijacked a ship. They have to be killed, right? If you're planning to take sides in this film, you will be pleasantly if not unnervingly surprised. There are no sides. There is no good and evil. Harrison Ford plays the reluctant, burned out Blade Runner very well. His character is drab and dull, as it was meant to be; look at him in the Spinner on the way to Tyrell corporation- pure boredom. He hates his job. If there were any narration, it Should sound dull and uninteresting, reflecting his character. Rutger Hauer gives the greatest performance of his career (so far) in this film, playing Roy Batty, Replicant 'project manager'. He dominates the later part of the film. He is cold, stiff and evil, but in the end speech, one of the Greatest endings I have ever seen, his performance alone makes this film a Classic. The ending is beautiful, and the score by Vangelis is perfect.All in all, the film is excellent. Well directed by Ridley Scott, innovative and stunning imagery underlined by Vangelis' superb score, and plenty to think about (on your own- no spoon feeding). Check out the trivia for this film; scientists voted it better than 2001:A Space Odyssey. Is the quest for humanity a crime? Find out for yourself. Blade Runner is a Must-Watch, and a Must-Have film.My rating: 8.9 / 10 Thank you for your time. Kris"
"I can imagine that back in the 80s this was mindblowingly good and the visuals hold up very well to this day, but story and character wise... For a movie that's relatively slow paced, there is hardly any character development, logical decisions or motivation (aside for revenge, survival and being forced back on duty) for most of the runtime. Characters make such rash decissions, it's almost laughable. All this sadly makes a decently build up universe, pretty boring.. The acting wasn't bad though. I'm giving this a 5 just for visuals and the fact that this probably has inspired quite a bit of (better) sci-fi today."
One of the only films of its kind. Blade Runner is one of my all-time favourite movies!
"Sometimes you just need to give a film a second chance, even if it is 20 years later! Only some rave reviews about the picture quality of this new 5-disc ""Complete Collector's Edition"" enticed me to watch this again. Wow, I am glad; this was a very entertaining and a tremendous visual and audio treat.I actually appreciated the audio best because, even in this new Blu-Ray era, one doesn't often find a film with very active surround speakers. However, this ""restored"" version did and the sound is, at the point, the best I've heard on a Blu-Ray disc....or any DVD, for that matter. The visuals? Well, fans of Blade Runner know all about them. They are fantastic. Scene-after-scene reminded me of a Stanley Kubrick film or another bizarre 1980s movie called ""Jacob's Ladder.""Because there are so many things to see and hear, and the story is different, one filled with strange characters, I can see where people would watch this film multiple times and enjoy it very much each time. The ""Collector's Edition"" has the best picture ever, according to director Ridley Scott, and ""is the version I'm most pleased with."" It has added scenes one didn't see in earlier versions. The rest of the DVD has those earlier versions. Apparently, there are several including those with Harrison Ford doing narration, like out of a late '40s film noir.Speaking of the latter, that's what this film looked like: a combination film noir (or neo-noir) and sci-fi movie. It has many dark images, fantastic night-time scenes, wonderful closeups and an always-interesting color palette. Sci-fi films usually get dated in a hurry, thanks to ever-increasing special-effects progress in the movie industry, but this still looks very good. Despite being made over 25 years ago, Blade Runner still looks very much state-of-the-art.Scott says this is the best version and the best his film has ever looked and sounded. Since it's his movie, who am I to argue. So, if you're like me and never gave this movie a chance (I lost interest halfway through with my VHS look at it), give this a second look on this Blu-Ray edition....and you will be blown away. This is, indeed, an amazing film."
"First time I saw this I wasn't impressed. Maybe because I expected more action from a Sci-Fi movie. Then I rented it on VHS, and upon re-watching I figured something out: This is one of the very few movies that gets better the more often you see it. It is a subtle movie. Slowly but surely this one has made it into the top 5 of my 'best movies of all time' list.I don't particularly care for the director's cut version, though. The inner monologue is missing - which gives you some of the most thought inspiring moments, and some of the added scenes downright make no sense at all. if I'd seen that one first I might never have given it a second chance.The cast is exceptional. Every one of them does a really fine job. Especially Rutger Hauer who otherwise has very few good movies to his name (maybe 'Day of the Falcon') delivers a stunning performance. Most of the cast who were unknown before this movie have moved on to fame (and some to fortune) - and rightfully so.From a technical point of view there is not much to criticize. More than 20 years later this movie still doesn't look dated (apart from 'Atari'-neon signs). The atmosphere is created with a lot of attention to detail, and the models of buildings are some of the most beautiful and believable ones I have ever seen.Now I recently read the book on which it is based ('Do androids dream of electric sheep' by Philip K. Dick). It's a quirky read and, frankly, not a very good book. It has too many plot holes, deus-ex-machina devices and logical inconsistencies, plus a total letdown of an ending. What it does add to the movie is the setup of why the atmosphere is like it is (polluted, dark, many 'freaks' around), and the nice question whether the Hero might be a replicant himself."
"I will confidently make the statement that Blade Runner is the best science-fiction picture ever made. I have seen every important sci-fi movie, and personally, Blade Runner reveals itself to be a superior film.
Space Odyssey and Alien come close, but they do not hold up as well as Blade Runner upon multiple viewings. Space Odyssey tends to lull in its more psychedelic moments, leaving one with a feeling of confused longing. No matter how many theories are expounded based on the content of the film, its ultimate meaning will remain ever-ambiguous, as Kubrick intended it to be. Alien is weakened by its inability to reach the viewer on a higher philosophical plane. The suspense in the film is nearly unparalleled, and Sigourney Weaver is fantastic, but it falls short of the excellence displayed in Blade Runner.
Let me explain why Blade Runner is my favorite:
The most striking aspect of the film is its cinematography. There is nothing but genius in the shooting of every scene. The use of shadows and low camera angles bears an uncanny resemblance to the cinematography of Citizen Kane. My favorite shot is when we get our first glimpse into Tyrell's office. The lighting effects in all of that set's scenes are fantastic.(especially when the windows become tinted). Please note that the lame-brains at the academy did not nominate Blade Runner for Best Cinematography. How stupid can you get?
Behind every film is the Director's vision, and in this film, Ridley Scott displays incredible vision. His conception of a futuristic LA, as characterized by the inevitable demographics of the future, is what allows the film to transcend its era and remain appreciated in the future. Many of the themes in the movie originate from the sci-fi novel (which carries an absurd title that does not obey the rules of logic:one does not dream of sheep; one thinks of sheep in an attempt to achieve a state of dream), yet the manner in which those themes are presented brings about the full genius of Ridley Scott. (How many Hardcore rock fans know where the phrase ""more human than human"" comes from?) Through the example of the replicants, Scott exposes the human sin of taking life for granted. Furthermore, he asks: what does it mean to be human? Do we have a false vision of our own morality as a race? Do we ignore our own evils? Can we play God as Tyrell attempts to do? The complexity of all these questions allows for many viewings of the film.And then, of course, there are the actors. None of them stand out in their roles, and yet the acting is perfect. Harrison Ford plays Deckard, the misanthropic ex-cop, who comes off as a veritable anti-hero. Sean Young plays Rachel, the incredibly human replicant that steals his heart. Rutger Hauer plays Roy, the umistakably Aryan leader of the replicants. All three of them deserved Oscar nominations. The other minor roles are superb as well.Finally, Blade Runner would not be itself without the Vangelis soundtrack. It has a wonderful mood-controlling effect throughout the film. I especially like the Blade Runner Blues, and Rachel's song.
I think that anybody who's read through my entire comment gets the point: I love this movie and I find it to be the best. If you haven't seen it, get over to the video store NOW!!! For first time viewers be sure to get the original version. When you have become familiar enough with the plot, go see it as it was meant to be, (without the voice-over), and rent the director's cut. If you live in a big city, you might be lucky enough to catch it on the big screen at an independent theatre."
"When I saw it, I wanted to be in high technology. When he spoke to the computer and instructing it to move, zoom in, left, right, print.... I ended up eventually doing the same things in my line of business. At first not as fancy, then we just made leaps over what was fantasy in that movie. We are still working on the genetics aspect. My job takes me to places that amazing young people work on applications that seem unrealistic to me. Person specific medication is one. No longer needing to take medicine with side effects or too much of one chemical and too little of the other. Laser sharp medication is more like it. Based on your DNA and anything that makes you what you are chemically, a mixture of medication with exact doses of each ingredient will be produced and it will target the problem that you have. Instead of a shotgun approach. I am told that it's not there yet for mental health issues but it works on addiction. Mental health issues are another category in themselves. Probably 30 years from now one of these people told me. Maybe never she said. If it is so darn complicated I wonder if there is hope for the poor souls living every day of their lives with one for or another of anxiety. Like the characters in this movie. The poor replicas did not even have a say in their existence. No different than us really. But their lives came with an expiration date. Ours is a highway that we take and choose when to get gas, pee or what sideroads to take. Much different."
"How this film has been underrated when it came out (mediocre, dull etc)!This is one of the very few films I like to re-watch from time to time. Ultimately this is not something I do for the story. Although I sometimes find new content here and there, things I missed the first time, the major reason to re-watch films like this is: -the astounding visuals (watch it in High Definition and be amazed, factor 10); -the music, I love Vangelis' unique soundtrack because he managed to make jazzy/bluesy synth music;-the atmosphere. Sure, it's all been done before, the film noir routine, but here it engages without being too formulaic. The philosophical themes are interesting too providing plenty of questions if you are interested. Mostly: what does it mean to be human? For instance, watch Rachel cry when she finds out she's not human after all. It evokes a form of pity, because, is she really that different from us? Isn't she worthy of a normal life? Aren't we all machines in a way, following the written routines in our own DNA code? Lack of empathy makes the replicants different from humans, but only for older models. And they get more human by the day. When they get too human they expire...the 4 year lifespan. But like any life form, they want survival. More even, to get the maximum out of the whole experience called life. Human after all?If you're not interested in such questions, this is still a beautiful film for the unequaled visuals, music, atmosphere and acting.I like the simple, original romantic ending, it's less ambiguous than the director's cut and I didn't mind the voice over at all. The director s cut has a completely different climax which is maybe less satisfying but stimulates much more thinking. Both versions endings are good and deserve recognition (particularly the original version has been bashed too much).The film is also better than the book though some would disagree. The book fails in truly capturing the atmosphere of a future where most living things are mechanical because it's one of Dick's less efficient books with a very forgettable ending. As much as I like his tales, his ideas usually outshine his writing. The film has much more atmosphere and tension."
"Blade Runner show the audience back in 1982 that Sci-fi doesn't always need to be in space, it can be apocalypse city Noir story and Also philosophy matter. And the directors cut in 1990 is the best version.Rick Deckard is reinstated as a Blade Runner detective after he quit because he had enough of being a killer. His job is to kill replicants just because they are illegal on earth. He interview an employee of tyrell corporation Rachel, who turns out to be a replicant with memory implants. The other four replicants he is chasing are the nexus 6 model, a strong new advance replicants used for military which makes Deckards chase more dangerous, but their crime is they want more life.The movie has a very strong philosophy in the story, what is real and what is not, is Deckard human or not, and do replicants have feelings or are they implants. This kind of philosophy movie was unusual at that time and revolutionized the way we make movies today. It's a strong 10/10 and forever and ever more."
"A sci-fi classic that set up the rules for cyberpunk genre in movies. Also in my top 10 of all time favorites. It has aged well, though some scenes do feel a bit dated (the slightly ""rape-y"" vibe during the love scene comes to mind). If you are in the US, be sure to watch the ""Director's Cut"" edition."
"What a waste of time. 2 hours however long of my life wasted. I watched the directors cut and boy is it boring. Easily the most boring film i've seen since avatar. I personally love sci-fi films whether it be star wars or alien. My favourite book of all time is enders game. The film moves so slowly that I could feel my hair grow faster. There are literally 5 things that happen in the movie. People read way to far in this movie about how it's supposed to be about how the robots were more humans than the people, personally I believe that's a load of poppycock. When the original was released nobody went to see it, the original was cut and given a commentary for a reason, the film was too long, boring and doesn't make much sense. The commentary helped this film so much, it gave it a story and stops the watcher from having to make up some random story to stop themselves dosing off."
"I'm writing this review after reading at least 30 reviews here on IMDb (10 of 1 star, 20 of 7+) and I just wanted to emphasize how shocked I am that someone actually gave this one above 5 (maybe for the effects which aren't that special, even then) and I must agree deeply with the 1 star givers - This is probably one of the worst, most viewer insulting, carp of a film I've seen and I'm a Sci-Fi / Fantasy standard geek who read lots of books and see 90% of all genre related movies. All the characters are near to completely shallow, the dialogues are pathetic and scares, the wanna-be-Protagonist (i.e. the replicants) are seem to be on cracks with super-power and no apparent real intellect (or moral, if that even matters). The concept of sending one man (may he be a replica or not) against the ""most dangerous escapee"" is ridiculous, all the genius ""gene creators"" have no security none so ever, live in dirty places (and always alone!) and have no survival instinct at all. I can't believe Philip K. Dick book is that shallow (which I haven't read as of yet). This was a boring movie, with no real philosophical point, no trigger to continue watching it and no deep thoughts at the end...Is this really the movie that was considered a milestone in Sci-Fi? I tend to think even BttF trilogy had more philosophical moments :( Don't waste your time on this movie!"
"For the life of me I can't think of a reason why this movie is held with such high regards in the sci-fi community, except for having the holy trinity of geekdom (it's set in the future, sexy robots and Harrison Ford). Every movie geek that wants to secure their geek cred will go out of their way saying this movie is awesome and the best thing to happen to sci-fi since the invention of movies. In reality, they are loath to admit that it's a boring, overrated piece of cinematographic crap that nobody outside the community actually likes. Even though I've had all my life to watch this movie, I've never made it the whole way through in one sitting. In fact, I've seen more of Flash Gordon and Conan in one sitting than I have of this movie (and the fact that I made it almost all the way through both Guru and Gigli is a testament to my unwillingness to turn away from a movie once I start to watch them). Overall, a boring movie that nobody should bother with. If you want Ford, robots or movies set in the future there are far better things out there than this one. Having all the things you like in one movie doesn't make it good."
"I saw ""Blade Runner"" in the theater again today (more on that later). First time I saw this film, it was the original version when it came out in Belgium (where I grew up) in 1982. Decades later, I saw it again, this time on DVD and in the ""Director's Cut"" or ""Final Cut"", I can't quite remember. The version I saw today was definitely the Final Cut.""Blade Runner"" (originally released in 1982; The FInal Cut released in 2007; 117 min.) brings the story of Deckard, as he tracks down 4 replicants who have escaped from an Off World and need to be ""retired"" with extreme prejudice. As the movie opens, we are reminded it is ""Los Angeles, November, 2019"". YES, this very year! In Ridley Scott's (bleak and dark) vision of the future, LA is in permanent darkness and rain, with lots of pollution, and lots of overcrowding. Our man Deckard (Harrison Ford) meets Rachel (Sean Young), who may or may not be a replicant, who can tell for sure? In the meantime Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) is the leader of the replicants and up to no good...While watching this in the theater today, I was struck by several things: first, the enormous vision from Ridley Scott this movie asked for (and received). Second, the set design and production is out of this world STILL, now almost 40 years later. Third, while there is very little ""action"", this movie flew by in no time (same as its Blade Runner 2049 sequel, incidentally). A movie like ""Blade Runner"" begs to be seen on the big screen. As luck would have, my art-house theater here in Cincinnati is doing a month-long sci-fi classics festival during July, and this was the first (and certainly not the last) that I was eager to see again in the theater. The July 4 matinee screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely, and I imagine the later screenings will be PACKED. If you have a chance to see ""Blade Runner"" in the theater, run, do not walk! It makes for an unforgettable movie theater experience."
"The film describes a future in which, through genetics, artificial humans are manufactured and called ""replicants""; employees in dangerous jobs and slaves in the outer colonies of the Earth. Made by Tyrell Corporation under the motto ""more humans than humans"" -especially the ""Nexus-6"" models- not only resembles humans, they are far superior physically.The replicants were declared illegal on planet Earth after a bloody mutiny occurred on the planet Mars, where they worked as slaves. A special police force, Blade Runners, is in charge of identifying, tracking and killing - or ""withdrawing"", in terms of the police itself - the fugitive replicants found on Earth. With a group of replicants loose in Los Angeles, Rick Deckard, the best agent that has existed in regard to the recovery and removal of the replicas, is removed from his semi-retirement to use some of ""the old magic blade runner"".Ridley Scott fantastic dark cyberpunk style and futuristic design is so well made that achieved to create a visual vocabulary: abandonment, decay, loneliness, obscurity, indifference, alienation and neon lights are the core of the aesthetics of the film, which will eventually become and serve as a pattern for successive cinematographic works.The script David Webb Peoples adapted from 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' takes the viewer into a dwelling and philosophical controversy, as it creates doubt and empathy to the so called replicants, primarily as seen in many shots of Rick Deckard hesitating about the true nature of his task.Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer haunts the attention into the essence of the story. Their characterization throughout infiltrates the different conceptions of life. A saddened soul searching for the meaning of his punished existence and the other, ruminating a task sinking him into a moral void brimming with guilt.At the end, the movie leaves you wondering about the implications the creation of highly intelligent beings (IA) must have and, if it's worth treating them as machines or they have become so human that the difference is non existent.""Time... to die"".10/10"
"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Perfect music by Vangelis, perfect acting by Harrison Ford and Sean Young, haunting performance by Rutger Hauer, Ridley Scott at his best, SFX almost up-to-date, what can I say?Well, I could say only one thing: this movie, a masterpiece of its own, is again a proof that Philip K. Dick's work is very hard to translate into a mainstream movie.SPOILER AHEAD!!!In the book, Rachel has sex with Deckard in order to prevent him from killing the other replicants. She does it as a job for Tyrell Corporation, in a sense. And Deckard ends up thinking that only child born humans are humans, man built androids are not. Dick answers one of his main question in this book: What is humanity? The movie gives the opposite answer. Rachel is human for Deckard, maybe more human than Bryant or Tyrell. This is Scott's sacrifice to the happy ending. Director's cut end is less happy (how ridiculous was this extended lifespan story?). My end to the movie would s ee Deckard kill Rachel while she's asleep. Some would say the actual end gives the movie more power by leading the audience to think Deckard is a replicant. How about a man who protects himself from mere sexual desire by killing a machine? Not a happy end, I know..."
"It is ironic how Sci-fi genre is the most dependent on the technical side of the filmmaking compared to other genres and yet with all the technological improvements we will probably never see a better sci-fi film than most of the older ones. And even more ironically, the technical side of the filmmaking was the very quality that created the unique styles of the old sci-fi films. So, what makes these old films, Blade Runner in particular, so good looking compared to modern films, despite the fact that they had little technology back then? Speaking of visual style alone, what makes it so memorable compared to new films that are made with all the technological possibilities at filmmakers' disposal? There are three main answers to these questions:1. singular artistic vision as opposed to an army of graphic designers,2. director's own decisions as opposed to a director who does whatever he's told to,3. and lastly care and love in craftsmanship for the film by those who involved in making of it.Did you know that one of the buildings in Blade Runner was actually a kitchen sink? With all its miniatures and matte paintings the city looks gorgeous. Because people took their time to create it and they cared. It looks more real too than those created with CGI. And I know that uncanny valley effect is a term used for humans but I think it applies to objects as well. You can tell, most of the time, whether an object is physically there or it is a computer effect. CGI looks cheap. Blade Runner is like a hand-made classic European sports car whereas most modern films are like a Toyota Corolla, supposed to be better than the old ones but they are not, made out of plastic in an assembly line, and they look cheap.Another thing, other than the visuals, that makes this film so good is the soundtrack. Vangelis is one my favorite composers of all time. His style is unique and his music is so emotional. The soundtrack for Blade Runner perfectly fits and even helps create the ambiance of its universe. There are some films, like Jaws (1975) for example, that owe most of their success to their composers. I am not saying Blade Runner is one those films. Because it's visually and story-wise so good, It would still be a great film with different soundtrack, but at the same time, the soundtrack of Blade Runner is probably the best soundtrack for a movie ever, even though it didn't depend solely on its soundtrack for the mood.The story and acting are also very good. Though I must note that when I say acting, I mean Rutger Hauer's performance specifically. What a great performance from him. In fact, I wouldn't even bring up the acting in this film if it wasn't for Rutger Hauer. He totally steals this film. Harrison Ford is so mediocre most of the time and at times his acting gets even weird and bad. But in my opinion, this contrast of acting performances somewhat serves the film in a serendipitous way. We see how much there is to Roy, how a great character he is compared to Deckard, who looks like a mere policeman following orders with no depth to his personality. This brings me to the story of the film which is very simple in itself but brings up so many questions to the mind. Roy, an artificial human -a replicant as named in the film- seeking more life. As an agnostic person who suffers from death anxiety, I couldn't relate more to any movie character in my life than I relate to Roy. Don't we all suffer from fear of death, like Roy? I don't even know if I was created or not, as an agnostic. So I don't get to go after my creator, if there is such a thing, and ask for more life. But Roy has this chance and this is the plot of the film. But it is only incidental. For me, the film is all about the tragedy of being mortal. And by giving replicants a life span of only 4 years, we are reminded how short our own lives are. It is hard for us to realize somethings in life before an artist magnifies or reduces something so we can see it better. 4 years, 40 years, 80 years... In eternity, all those numbers lose their significance, as Roy put it more poetically ''...all those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain...''And then there is this fact about Roy that he is an artificial human, but his passion for life makes you think about what makes us alive and sentient. I remember this line from another film ''I, Robot (2004)'' it goes like this ''...When does a perceptual schematic become consciousness?...'' this is a very good question indeed. In fact, even for (organic) organisms, you can question the extent of their consciousness or for more simple life forms you can even think whether they are conscious at all. Or you can ask what makes us special and unique. Is it because we have souls? Or perhaps soul is something we made up and it is all about the chemicals that effect our decisions and the complexity comes from merely endless combinations and permutations of these chemicals. That idea makes you question your very own existence. The very fact that we have medication for depression tells us something about human mind. But we can speculate about these facts. I choose to accept that Roy is nothing less than a human in that matter. I've heard people complaining how they cannot relate to a ''robot'' regarding this film, but in my opinion that just shows lack of imagination."
"I was 15 when the film was released in 1982. I remember Gary Franklin (A Movie Critic on Television) gave this film a ""10"" on a scale of 1 to 10 ""10"" being best. When a friend of mine saw this he hated it and so I never saw until 1992. That is when the ""Director's Cut"" was released theatrically. I was now 25 years. I wanted to see this because I saw a clip on television and someone saying this film was meant to be seen on the ""Big Screen"" and so off I went. This cut of the film is most well known for being the version that ""Took Away"" the Harrison Ford Voice Overs. It also included a shot of a unicorn that implied that ""Harrison Ford"" is a Replicant. I was not blown away by this film. I thought it was ""good"" not ""great""The story does take its time but the rewards are huge if you pay close attention. . Its haunting images are so memorable that it influenced future filmmakers. In more ways than one it became the ""Metropolis"" of a new era. From the future setting to having different versions released. ""Blade Runner"" and ""Metropolis"" are 2 films one should watch back to back. Now my problem with ""Blade Runner"" is that each version is SLOW! The action could of moved faster. The story is very thin. Ridley Scott film is like an old man trophy wife. Pretty to look at but has almost nothing to offer!"
"An exercise in graphic design. A movie that wanted to speak to the human condition, but choosing to do so by avoiding all things human. There's lighting, and costumes, and set design to burn, but all the actors have been forbidden to act. One cardinal rule has been adhered to, ""show no emotion"". In the future, it rains all the time and we've all become automatons, sheesh, would somebody mind writing a movie for this trailer?"
"Blade Runner is perhaps the worst film adaption of a novel ever made. To say that Blade Runner is an adaption of Phillip K Dick's inspiring novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" is not only a lie, but it is an insult to both Phillip K. Dick and any movie that has been adapted to film with even a marginal degree of success. It is most generous and honest to say that Blade Runner is inspired by ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"".Blade Runner presents, at best, a surface-level representation of a select few of the novel's characters; these representations are devoid of the depth that made them captivating. Likewise, there are many great (and well-developed) characters who were excluded from the film.The subplots, entire segments of the plot, the greater part of its ethos, and major aspects of the novel's theme are also expunged from this film. In short, the elements of the novel that have moral, narrative, effusive, or dramatic merit are conspicuously absent from this film.Instead of being a narrative that re-affirms greater truths about humanity, Blade Runner exists only as a testament to sloppy adaptation by screenwriters who have such little respect for literature that they would cinematically re-hash a novel's spark notes.I believe that, were the novel by which Blade Runner is inspired more widely read, society would recognize Blade Runner as the fecal insult to great literature that it is."
"I love Harrison Ford. I had very high expectations with this movie. The future, robots that look like humans, futuristic city, flying cars. And it has an 8.3 rating. I cannot explain how overrated this movie is. The movie does not explain anything about what is happening. The entire first quarter of the movie is Harrison Ford walking around extremely confused. There is very little action in this movie and the false opinion that the movie reveals something about ""human nature"" or ""the human mind"" is plain wrong. If you are a hardcore science fiction person, action person, or any human being that has ever lived, you will hate this movie. Half way through the movie, Harrison ford drops everything he's doing to practically rape one of the robots. I was only thirty minutes in when I wanted to turn it off but I'm glad I stayed until the ending because I have found the most over rated film in the history of science fiction"
I can't count the number of times I have watched this movie! This neo-noir sci-fi epic puts you in the mindset of a not too far fetched dark future. Amazing film score and one hell of a plot!!
"Blade Runner is considered one of the greatest science fiction films ever made and it is easy to see why. Deeply thematic, rich characters, a fantastic script and nuanced performances toppled with some of the greatest cinematography ever put on film this is a film version of the mona lisa- every frame can be hung on a wall. Ridley Scott, fresh off the success of Alien is in top form and Blade Runner will be the film he will always be remembered for. Harrison Ford is competent as Deckard and anyone expecting him to be the usual dashing hero will be disappointed. Rutger Hauer steals the show as head replicant Roy Batty. The noir look of the film has inspired so many movies and video games since there isn't really a point talking about it- you have to see it to believe it. One of the greatest films ever made. Period."
"Being in my 40's and a big Sci-Fi fan, it was really odd that I had never seen this movie till now - and I have to say, it wasn't worth the wait!I wont argue that the film was very artfully shot, but the story was slow and just bizarre. Of course bizarre is what film students and art critics love, so I'm not surprised that this is so highly thought of, and i'm sure they spend many an evening pouring over the plot, trying to find hidden meanings that aren't really there.Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar..... Sometimes a slow and dated plot, is just a slow and dated plot.....If you watch movies, not to make yourself look intelligent, but rather (heaven forbid), to be entertained, give this one a miss."
"I actually appreciated the audio best because, even in this new Blu-Ray era, one doesn't often find a film with very active surround speakers. However, this ""restored"" version did and the sound is, at the point, the best I've heard on a Blu-Ray disc....or any DVD, for that matter. The visuals? Well, fans of Blade Runner know all about them. They are fantastic. Scene-after-scene reminded me of a Stanley Kubrick film or another bizarre 1980s movie called ""Jacob's Ladder."" Because there are so many things to see and hear, and the story is different, one filled with strange characters, I can see where people would watch this film multiple times and enjoy it very much each time. The ""Collector's Edition"" has the best picture ever, according to director Ridley Scott, and ""is the version I'm most pleased with."" It has added scenes one didn't see in earlier versions. The rest of the DVD has those earlier versions. Apparently, there are several including those with Harrison Ford doing narration, like out of a late '40s film noir.Speaking of the latter, that's what this film looked like: a combination film noir (or neo-noir) and sci-fi movie. It has many dark images, fantastic night-time scenes, wonderful closeups and an always-interesting color palette. Sci-fi films usually get dated in a hurry, thanks to ever-increasing special-effects progress in the movie industry, but this still looks very good. Despite being made over 25 years ago, Blade Runner still looks very much state-of-the-art."
"Hey! Get this straight. If you don't like Blade Runner, you don't understand it. Why? Because you don't. You're not allowed to dislike it.Over the years Blade Runner has gathered around itself such a huge fan-base (that's so out of whack) that anyone who says they dislike it is instantly discredited and dismissed as an idiot. So, you better like Blade Runner, or you're an idiot, got it? Blade Runner is a completely brain-dead, wannabe, intellectual, Sci-Fi film that spends 2 hours delivering a careless and poorly managed love story and then ""Wham! Bam!"" at the end it's suddenly a statement about the meaning of life. (Sorry, but the last 10 minutes don't make up for the first 2 hours.)And the question was raised - ""Was Deckard really a replicant?"" Who cares! Harrison Ford's portrayal was about as realistic as that of a robot. And about half the time he walked around looking like he'd just been punched in the nuts.Is Blade Runner a finely sculpted masterpiece of cinematic excellence? No, it is not!! If this film is really Ridley Scott's idea of poignant commentary, then it sure makes me glad to know that he doesn't have an ego."
"One of the best science fiction movies ever made, Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" has survived the passage of time thanks to Scott's impressive attention to detail and the strengths of Philip K. Dick's source material. Harrison Ford makes for a striking leading man here, managing to walk a fine line between confidence and vulnerability, and he's surrounded by a top-notch supporting cast, but none as effective as Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah and Joanna Cassidy as the Replicants: Hauer's performance is a peculiar stand-out here, while Hannah and Cassidy makes the most out of limited running time. The score is majestic and the special effects are jaw-dropping, and while the pace is slow, it's an extraordinarily effective classic. (Final Cut("
"I was 18 years old boy when BR was made, in 1982.
The first projection was in 1984 (Belgrade, Yugoslavia). Everything, from music to films were coming down to YU after while, at list with a year of postponing.
I met with my matees in city center and by simple luck we decided to went to Odeon theatre to wotch this film.
I went in, took my seat, and went out, stoned, two hours later.
Everything after was history. Very recomended for youngest generations to put BR in watch list."
"Yeah... weirdest freaking movie. Awesome though. Acting, music, cinematography, it is all great. Yes it is a strange movie, but the best ones often are. 10/10 recommend! It's pretty sci-fi, a little suspenseful at some points, and definitely NOT a movie to watch with your children. Haha. Has some fantastic action scenes, yet also stunning visuals that blow the audience away. Effects are great considering the year Blade Runner was produced. If given the chance, definitely watch this movie."
"Very good adaptation of ""Do androids dream about electric sheep?"" by Philip K Dick.

"""Blade Runner"" is one of the best science-fiction movies ever made. This movie shows that science-fiction stories have brains. It was directed by famous writer and director Ridley Scott. Starring legendary Harrison Ford and famous only in his native Holland Rutger Hauer. The main female role went Sean Young for who it was a debut in the full-length movie.The film tells us the story of Rick Deckard(Harrison Ford) replicant(androids) hunter. Once he gets a task to stop a group of replicants who escaped from a colony. However, the group under the Roy Batty( Rutger Hauer) command is not going to give up. Pursuing a group, Deckard understands that he has strange feeling in relation to one replicant Rachael(Sean Young). This is the main question of the film whether people can feel something to the machines and if so, are they different from us.""Blade Runner"" has a lot of positive moments. Firstly, the movie looks very spectacular. Special effects look realistic and the style is one of the best in cyberpunk stories. Also the film is notable for its excellent acting and wonderful musical accompaniment.The film has only one minus. It is a little tight but it does not spoil the impression
.
I want to recommend this film to all people who want to see a movie that wiil make them think and it is better that they be over 14)."
"Blade Runner is a prime example of how visionary and brilliant Ridley Scott can be when he tries. The film mixes extraordinary (well, for 1982) visual effects, great acting and a genuinely original and deep plot about what it means to be human.The plot, on a base level, concerns the exploits of ""Blade Runner"" Deckard as he hunts down rogue Reploids; advanced human-like androids that have a four-year lifespan to compensate for their other advantages. The rogue group, lead by Roy Batty, is looking to extend their aforementioned lifespans. This is really only a simple interpretation. The film is really about what it means to be a human being, especially when the reploids seem to demonstrate more humanity than the humans.Visually, the film looked in incredible in 1982, and still looks pretty good today. It's not just the backgrounds, but the incredible sets and mise en scene that truly bring the film to life in a way that makes it feel real. And as we approach 2019 (this review was written in Oct. 2018), the world of Blade Runner looks more and more eerily similar to our own.The performances in the film are just incredible. Harrison Ford as a depressing, inhumane drunk may not exactly sell itself, especially considering the types of roles he was known for playing at that point in time (i.e. charming rogue). However, Ford proves beyond all reasonable doubt that he can play his part, giving a stellar performance that allowed him to break free of the Han Solo typecast. But the real star of the show is Rutger Hauer, who gives a Shakespearean performance as Roy Batty. The soundtrack also deserves special mention for being varied and bizarre, and yet always managing to fit the scene perfectly. A deep, melancholy magnum opus, Blade Runner will surely be remembered as one of the greatest films ever made."
"One of the best films of the 80's and one of the greatest classics ever. This film is one of those movies that has everything, has action, adventure, suspense, science fiction and persecution. In addition, the film has actors such as Harrisn Ford, had a good director (Ridley Scott), had a good soundtrack and had special effects. Highly recommend."
"Blade Runner has become a cult hit in the 19 years since its release.  It is understandable why.  The film has a disjointed, postmodern narrative surrounded by superb photography and set design.  The hero is not even a hero and the conclusion of the film, at least the director's cut, isn't all that happy.  Most of all, Blade Runner eerily shadows the near future for our own world, the future of cloning and unnaturally created humans. Science fiction has always been able to show us images of ourselves or our world in a future or alien world, things we would prefer not to see.Blade Runner's premise is simple.  Deckard (Harrison Ford) has to hunt down four Replicants': artificial humans who have great intelligence but superior physical attributes.  These replicants have run amock in space colonies and now human authorities on Earth are worried that the replicants will do the same here.All of this is really nothing more than a faint attempt at a story.  Blade Runner's success lies not with its story element, but with the amazing vision of fantasy and fear of its director, Ridley Scott.  Scott had previously made ""Alien"", another postmodern vision of man's possible future. In that film he questioned colonisation, globalization (but on a intergalactic scale), our fascination with destriction and the corruption of modern business.  In ""Blade Runner"", Scott explores corruption, man's destructive nature, but he also delves into emotion and the possibility of someone ELSE creating those emotions for us, as is the case for the replicants.The plot plays second fiddle to the set design and costumes.  The choice of Los Angeles being the setting for the film is brilliant: at present L.A. is a city blanketed in sunshine, with an image of blonde babes and surfers all too obvious.  In ""Blade Runner"" the city is nothing like it is today.  It has become a blend of Tokyo, New York and some Eastern European wasteland of pollution.The vehicle, weapons and costumes all have a distinctive 1980's - apocalyptic - retro feel to them, the flying cars are almost too cheesy to be taken seriously, but combined with Vangelis' synthesizer score and the noir-ish feel of the narrative they fit just perfectly.
""Blade Runner""'s narrative is just that: film noir.  Deckard is akin to Sam Spade, he's seen it all, been there and back, and is a tortured soul.  It's got the femme fatale, the more evil than evil villan and the corporation that is somehow responsible for all this mess.  At the same time the film is a thriller, a western and a science fiction yarn.Harrison Ford is suited as Deckard.  He is the anti-Han Solo or Indiana Jones.  Rutger Hauer is superbly evil too, it is a shame he hasn't been able to follow this up with anything as good.Many films since this have tried to show a world void of any semblances of what we take for granted today, but none have compared to ""Blade Runner"". The film that came closest to it would be the Japanese animation ""Akira"" which also deals with similar themes.Science fiction always succeeds when the viewer is planted in the story one step beyond what might have actually happened.  See Planet of the Apes, Alien, Star Wars, et al.  In ""Blade Runner"" we get a vision of the world as it may actually be one day.  Maybe not 2019, but somewhere down the track the science fiction of films such as these may become science fact.""Blade Runner"" is one of THE definitive sci-fi movies ever made."
"I spent a weekend with the new DVD set of Blade Runner. Watched all four versions pretty much back to back (minus the work print version) starting with the US theatrical and finishing with the Final Cut. And across those eight hours I spent with the film, I did not get tired of watching – just watching – that futuristic film-noir vibe: deep dark shadows and majestic use of light and color used to make a run-down polluted cityscape look so beautiful. In fact, when I got to the Final Cut, which had been cleaned up, restored, and remixed, the picture and sound quite literally took my breath away.Blade Runner is easily one of the best looking films ever made.In some ways, many ways, Blade Runner strikes me as silly. Particularly in its more climactic moments where the protagonist faces off against a replicant. Pris's acrobatic means of attacking Deckard? When Roy Batty chases Deckard in his shorts (when a few moments before he was fully clothed?) The film goes over-the-top to the point where I find myself asking, ""why in the world would the characters do that?!"" But here's what's interesting: as silly as Blade Runner may get it never betrays its own world. Everything that happens, in some queer way, feels natural to this strange futuristic world.I like the movie in its action scenes, but I simply adore it during the quieter moments – the parts where not a whole hell of a lot is happening, and you can simply watch and absorb Jordan Cronenweth's marvelous cinematography. My favorite scene comes when Rachel has saved Deckard's life. An emotional wreck of killing another replicant on top of the revelation that she, herself, is a replicant – she stands by a window where light floods in, so much light that the whole screen goes white, and then it recedes again and we see the characters again. Later in that same scene, she sits at the piano, plays for a bit, and then lets her hair down. Hearing Deckard stumbling in the other room, she looks out of the corner of her eye  and shot after shot after shot through this entire sequence demonstrates absolute mastery over the frame.Plus some of the other quiet moments resonate with a truer low-key science-fiction feel such as the scene in Tyrell corporation where Deckard applies the Voight-Kampff test to Rachel. More or less a mundane questionaire/interview with a typical sci-fi gadget sitting on the table, but Ridley Scott and Terry Rawlings compacts the lengthy endeavor into a few short moments using a stunningly simple montage.Later on, Deckard sits in front of a voice-activated screen analyzing a photograph. The task is presented as a dull monotonous job (made especially evident in Harrison Ford's delivery), yet the scene, itself, never bores. The voice-activation not only serves as a staple sci-fi device, but cleverly allows Deckard to take the audience's hand and guide them through this investigative process. And perhaps what I like most about the scene: the audience, and even Deckard himself, doesn't even really know what he's found. Things don't magically fall into place with a Scooby-Doo moment of revelation. He finds another clue that might lead somewhere (albeit, since it's a movie it's a good guess the clue does lead somewhere.) In my mind at least moments such as the Voight-Kampff scenes, Deckard's briefing, the photograph analysis, both of Rachel's scenes in Deckard's apartment gives the world of Blade Runner a solid grounding so later on it can get away with the absurd.Which brings me to the replicants. Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) in particular, whose strangely sympathetic in that his murderous tendencies spawn directly from his fear of dying. This is a man who possesses a strong conviction that he deserves life perhaps because he looks around on earth and sees people squandering their existence while he knows he only has a few short moments. Why should a shmuck like Deckard live for 50+ years when Roy in his 4 short years has seen attack ships burning off the shoulder of Orion and seen C-beams glitter in the dark  ""If only you could see what I've seen with your eyes,"" he proudly and warmly tells one of the scientists who helped create him.As for which cut of the film, I don't think any single one is perfect (and I'd honestly watch any of them in a heartbeat.) I prefer the ""Final Cut"" over the others and admire Ridley Scott's restraint in his definitive DVD release. Most of the modifications are fine-tuning tweaks the casual viewer won't even notice unless watching two version back to back, and most of said fine-tuning improve the film (although, admittingly, Roy's beckoning of Sebastian could've been left out.) But hell, all versions of Blade Runner are included, so people don't have much room to complain about the changes. And no matter what version you go with, it's still a beautiful film to just  watch."
"I had seen the Director's Cut (a misleading title) of Blade Runner and was slightly underwhelmed. I mean, sure it looked great, but the supposedly deep story just didn't grab me. Then I got the five disc briefcase for Christmas and immediately put in the Final Cut. Wow. It's all clear now.Blade Runner is one of a precious few pantheon of science fiction film that has become even more prescient as time passes (the other that comes to mind is 2001: A Space Odyssey). Look at the L.A. in this film, then look at present-day Los Angeles. Subtract the flying cars and robots and you've got the same city (horribly polluted and overpopulated with many ethnicities mixing language and cultures). We follow Deckard, a specialized cop known as a Blade Runner who hunts down androids known as replicants. These machines look like humans and, if given time to mature, emote like humans. They are used as labor and sex slaves, but die out after a 4 year period so their emotions do not develop (this too has ties to the modern world. Planned obsolescence is the reason your electronics never last more than a year or two). When a replicant starts to piece things together before it dies, Deckard must take it out before it harms humans.As the film progresses, we can see that Deckard doesn't particularly like his job despite the fact that he is the best Blade Runner in town. The replicant Rachael (played by Sean Young) seems to trigger a re-evaluation of his life, and he takes no pleasure in hunting the group of dangerous androids he's been hired to ""retire"".This film is Sir Ridley Scott's masterpiece, and the one that best shows his talents. Like his idol Kubrick, Scott knows how to light a scene just the right way, and his use of smoke and blinds and fans and anything else that distorts light is what gives the film its noir feel. He drops clues all along the way to that paramount of questions: Is Deckard a replicant? Every clue can be construed to fit either side of the debate, and it proves that there is no wrong answer to the question.The Final Cut essentially omits and touches up more than it adds. Most ""director's cuts"" are excuses to throw in material that was cut for a reason (and a good deal of them are done without the director's consent). Here, Scott digitally touches up a few technical flaws, but he doesn't go crazy like Lucas. Also, we get the complete unicorn scene, which is crucial to the film's big question, as well as sticking with the DC's omitted voice-over narration (which is such a blessing, by the way).In the end Blade Runner is a masterful look at that which makes us human. Roy Batty's final act gives us all the insight into replicants we need and his final speech is perhaps the single most moving moment in science fiction. It serves to underscore the whole film, and it sends chills down my spine every time I see it. Blade Runner is one of those precious sci-fi films that actually challenges you to think, and it almost single-handedly founded the film genre of cyberpunk, which had been present in literature but hadn't crossed over. Cyberpunk is unquestionably the most thought-provoking sub-genre of science fiction, and this film is its masterpiece. Many people award a film they like a perfect 10, but this is truly a cornerstone that has influenced directors, actors, and entire genres of film."
"Awful - this is the only correct word that comes into mind while trying to express an impression after watching this horrible, endless, long, slow, trite, banal, bland, vapid, tasteless, languid, sorrowful and pitiful movie. Risdley Scott made this maybe as a film noir, instead he made a deep insult to all of us. Mindless bog, slow dark laughable waste of time and money, terribly poorly sync'd, with all plot holes, silly dialogs and unbearably poor acting of Hannah, Hauer, Harrison and all the rest. Ut seems they were all dead bored with this curio, and endless steamy dark scenes only build up a bigger misery that this film evokes. There are no redeeming features in this bog, no light in this drabness, no sense in this ugly mire. I was repeatedly told how cool Blade Runner was, now I say that the blade is blunt, and the only running must be away from this horrible dross. Must not be seen by anyone and ever."
"Blade Runner is quite simply wonderful, and not only is it one of Ridley Scott's best films, but also one of the best of the genre. For one thing, the visuals are superb. Not just in the special effects which are just mind-blowing but also in the cinematography, colours and sets. Another strong asset is the score, in fact Blade Runner is easily one of Vangelis's best by how mysterious and haunting it all is.The story is just great. True, it is the sort of film you need to see more than once to understand/appreciate it, but that is not a flaw in any way, quite the contrary. The story is very compelling, and also very deep thematically. Blade Runner is further advantaged by memorable dialogue, superb direction by Scott and good pacing. I can understand why some are underwhelmed by the ending, I was at first, but the more I saw the film the more the ending made sense to me. Finally the performances. Harrison Ford is perfectly cast, and Sean Young supports him admirably, but the real star of the cast is Rutgar Hauer who is outstanding in his role.In conclusion, a brilliant film and something Scott should be proud of. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"In the beginning of the Twentieth-First Century, the Tyrell Corporation releases the evolution of robots in the Nexus phase with Replicants that are identical to humans, but with superior strength and agility and the intelligence of the genetic engineers who created them. They are used off-world as slave labor in the colonization of other planets. After a bloody mutiny in a colony, the Replicants are declared illegal on Earth and hunted down by the Blade Runner units, special police squads that shoot them to kill. The execution of a Replicant is called retirement.In November 2019, in Los Angeles, the retired Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is summoned by his former chief Bryant (M. Emmet Walsh) that assigns him to hunt down four Replicants that are hidden in Los Angeles. Deckard studies the profiles of Roy (Rutger Hauer), Pris (Daryl Hannah), Leon Kowalski (Brion James) and Zhora (Joanna Cassidy) and finds that they had been designed with four years lifespan maximum and they tried to infiltrate themselves in the Tyrell Corporation. Deckard visits their creator, Dr. Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkel), in his corporation. Sr. Tyrell asks Deckard to demonstrate his Voigt Kampff method to discover the Replicants in his assistant Rachael (Sean Young) and Deckard concludes that she is a sophisticated Replicant but she does not know. When Deckard ""retires"" Zhora and Leon, he feels affected by their deaths and by the question of Rachel whether he has tested himself to know whether he is a Replicant. But he needs to end his mission and find Roy and Pris. ""Blade Runner"" is a melancholic work of art that raises existential questions about fear, life, death, emotions, mortality, humanity, dehumanization and love among other philosophical questions in an environment totally destroyed by excessive pollution, technology, marketing and consumption. The wrecked Earth is left to police and little people only, the others inhabitants have moved to the colonies in the off-world. The conflict appears when the retired Blade Runner Deckard is forced to hunt down Replicants again but now with different feelings, after falling in love for the Replicant Rachel and in doubt whether he is also a Replicant. Sean Young certainly has the best role of her career. The bleak cinematography and special effects are awesome and the soundtrack of Vangelis is among the most beautiful of the cinema history. I can not precisely say how many times I have watched the different versions of this film that is among my five favorite movies in the movie-theater, on VHS, on DVD and now on Blu-Ray, but my guess is at least twelve times. The last times I had seen this film were on 06 May 2000 and 31 May 2003. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Blade Runner"""
"There are movies that stand the test of time with the exception of some outdated special effects. Some movies in this category are: the Star Wars trilogy, Poltergeist, and even The Terminator. Then there are movies like Blade Runner, where one leaves the theater, or turns off the DVD player, scratching his head. Movies like Poltergeist and The Terminator work because both stories revolve around ordinary people with ordinary lives to whom the viewers can relate. Star Wars, while not completely relatable, has such an interwoven, tightly knit story in a fantastic world, that viewers can imagine the existence of such world. Even further, viewers know how to adapt to this world to the point where they can play dress up, speak Wookie, and recreate this environment. I've never heard of a Blade Runner convention.This movie wants so bad to be taken seriously, or does it? The soundtrack alone contradicts itself. The title sequence begins silently with a few heavy pounding beats and shrilling chords, making the viewer believe she is about to experience something along the lines of a war film, or better yet, a thriller. The movie's prologue somewhat adds to that assumption, although it's a little wordy and complicated of a background for the viewer to completely understand. Replicants bad. Humans good. Why? Dunno.After the serious introduction, the film loses credibility with its choice of bizarre magical fairy notes as though the story was a Read Along and it was asking its viewer to turn the page. Yes, the movie was made in 1982, but so was Poltergeist. And even then I am sure people were associating that sound of chimes with whimsical fairy dust. The sound often implies that something supernatural or magical has or is about to occur. However, it was just odd.There are other contradictions in the film, mainly the Replicants themselves, which left me with many questions. Why were Replicants created? If they are dangerous and illegal aliens then why is the Tyrell Corporation still producing them? Why are Replicants made in the first place if they are not supposed to exist? What is their beef with humans? What is humanity's beef with Replicants? Roy and Leon can handle sub temperatures like pros but Pris freaks out about a little rain? Am I supposed to feel sorry for Rachael? Why did Roy save Rick? What did Pris's acrobatics have to do with anything? Why didn't Rick retrieve his gun after he dropped it? Was climbing out onto the windowsill and scaling the side of the building really his best option? What's with: the guy with the mustache; the boiling eggs; the singing Japanese/Chinese lady; smoky/misty rooms and the city being foggy; the unicorn and the photos? Finally, how come the Replicants can run through sheets of glass, ram their heads through walls, and drive nails into the palms of their hands, but they fall down dead after one gunshot? The building is called the Bradbury, but if I were Ray, I would not feel flattered. Perhaps I did not catch on to every detail and many of the questions were answered in the movie, but I do not plan to watch this film again to find out."
"How much has the world changed since 1982? The computer wars were beginning and arcade games were the craze, yet our lives were at a height of sociability. Things were simple for the sake of simplicity. Life seemed to make more sense. But our minds were unconsciously drifting away from reality, whilst reality slowly made its way towards the visions of this powerful film. 'Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?', written by famous American Science Fiction author Phillip K Dick, was adapted to the screen by Sir Ridley Scott into 'Blade Runner'. Ridley's masterful transformation of Dick's nocturnal vision to celluloid, confused audiences who misunderstood a world which would seem more like reality only ten years later in the technology boom of the 90s. The film gained 'turkey' status upon its release and was quickly abandoned as a mess, soon doomed to gain dust in relentless video libraries.Ten years later the world only further resembled Blade Runner's scary vision. Upon its 1992 re-release, tickets sold out before they even hit the box-office. Even critic Roger Ebert rephrased his 1982 statement claiming it a masterpiece. And here began the Legacy of the most acclaimed Cult Film. Film critics around the world named it the most important science-fiction of all time with Kubrick's 2001 - and the most visually mesmerizing.The film follows the enlightenment of a Blade Runner (a cop) Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) in Los Angeles 2019, a dystopia falling apart from permanent drizzling twilight, rare natural life and where technology dictates existence. Following early retirement from his police unit, Deckard is forced into a desperate assignment by his ex-boss 'Bryant'. Four Replicants (humanoids) have escaped from an 'off-world colony', taking a shuttle back to Earth for unknown reasons. His mission: To kill all Replicants declared illegal on Earth. Deckard's unconscious approach to his job in a world deteriorating from lack of nature,sociability and eternal darkness slowly deteriorates when his eyes open to the most important questions in life. Beginning his investigations in the Pyramids of the Tyrell Corporation, responsible for manufacturing the Replicants, he meets his turning point, Rachel, who due to Deckard's Void Kompff machine (an empathy tester) is found a Replicant. Following a cold, immoral revelation to her about her origins, he is inevitably drawn to her emotionally, soon leading to his first sign of awakening, LOVE.From a cold beginning, without any sign of 'empathy' towards those around him, what Deckard finds out about Rachel, Elden Tyrell, and the so called ""EVIL"" Replicants he intercepts, enable him for the first time to feel and understand Love, Hate and the preciousness of Life respectively. Roy Batty, the leader of the Replicant mutineers, played convincingly by Dutch actor Rutger Hauer, is the most important symbol in the film, and is the ultimate enlightenment in Deckard's quest for humanity in learning that no matter if you're human or not, love, compassion and empathy are the most important human characteristics, and some Replicants are ""more human than human"". Contrary to initial perception, Batty shows these characteristics and we sympathize with him, something we wouldn't usually do with an 'artificial' human, with theoretically no emotions. Tyrell becomes the focal point of human degradation, in that in his vision of technological advance, he brings humanity, morality and nature closer to extinction as he sits atop his corporation like a 'Pharoah'.Finally, there are many evidences to suggest 'Deckard' is a Replicant, and this has been immortal debate since release. Either way, the film's message remains as strong. It's filled with overwhelming symbolism and meaning, that one viewing of this art-work will be exhausting.The film's intentions are not only to question what makes us human, but it also makes strong focus on reflecting our current issues of world Conservation, technological advance and the degradation of humanity from the media, exploitation, capitalism, and the complacency and destructive nature of humanity. In Ridley Scott's vision, the Sun that gives life has been blocked out by pollution due to the dominance of technology, and dreams of Unicorns suggests we long for the past, for rarity in Nature. What one must notice is that 'Eyes' play a key symbol throughout the film in explaining this, for it appears that most are 'artificial' than not.'Blade Runner' is Ridley Scott's masterpiece and perhaps one of the most poignant films of all time. Countless copycats including 'The Fifth Element', and 'Akira' have tried to imitate his legendary vision of a dark world gone wrong, which only seems more possible as the years fly by. I am happy to see that Blade Runner is so respected and that people understand its vision. It has embedded itself into my movie collection and along with 'The Mosquito Coast', another similar film with Harrison Ford regarding humanity, is my favorite film of all time.The music composed by 'Vangelis' is God-sent, sounding so mythical and dream-like. Set designs and cinematography have rarely been equaled  marvelously detailed. The whole cast were superb in bringing their characters to life. Especially Joe Turkel (Tyrell) and Rutger Hauer who played opposites of one another beautifully. Harrison Ford was irreplaceable as the lead, showing his transformation from a cold being into an human being expertly - it just seems so natural with him. However I believe Rutger Hauer should have received the Oscar for his performance as the human like Replicant. He has a commanding presence. Sean Young, playing Rachel, was a great choice. She's stunning and projects innocence well in showing Deckard's shortcomings. This film will be in the hearts of more 'as time goes by' and will never again end up accumulating dust in forgotten sections of video libraries. It's more than a 'classic'. I recommend everybody who loves film or philosophy to watch and explore its masterful telling. I have never seen a film as movingly deep. It's a poem from beginning to end and ""more human than human""."
"Perhaps the best sci fi movie ever made, this cult classic was underappreciated at its time. This only shows how shortsighted critics and American public can be. This movie is perfect in many ways, is prophetic, well made, and if not the best movie ever made is close to that, certainly in the sci fi genre."
"This by no means was a great movie. Movies like this and Taxi Driver, I just don't understand how people can rate it in the top 100 of ALL TIME.
Yes, the visual effects were great even by today's standards. But visuals alone don't make a movie. Otherwise the new Planet of the Apes should be mentioned in the top 100 too. Furthermore, I thought Ford was a total miscast (though not as much as Hoffman woulda been). I kinda got the feeling this movie couldn't decide if it wanted to be a philosophical drama, but then an action movie at times. It ultimately failed on both fronts. If you wanna see a philisophical, non-action Sci-Fi, IMO Gattaca did much better. Like others have mentioned here, this woulda been much better as a short. Not a 2 hour picture. And as for all the different ""versions"", I don't even care anymore.Check this one out if you will, just don't anticipate anything spectacular about it."
"There are several extraordinary things about Blade Runner.1) It does not state who's good and who's bad. 2) It throws you into a scenario that you'll probably not enjoy. 3) It doesn't bother to explain why things are the way they are. 4) It shows us something that, although it doesn't exist anywhere, still has an existential meaning to us.Apart from that Blade Runner has the best score ever. Vangelis created a style that in its simplicity strikes you far more as being of the future than any more sophisticated electronic music could ever do.The thing I was referring to in 4. is a grown up without experiences of his own. That is a logical impossibility, a paradox. But paradoxically it's one of the most powerful stimuli of existential reflection that were ever shown in cinema. The point being that it lets you ask yourself what all your experiences were good for.Not quite so subtle, yet still of interest, is the idea that you could be born into life knowing full well what your purpose is and how long you'll live. What does that do to you? The film answers that though, it's unacceptable, you'll deny it, seek something else, something more. It just cannot be that everything will be lost like tears in rain.But human ambition is a much broader theme of this film. The world itself, in which Blade Runner takes place, is a statement about the human longing for progress and power, his forwardness and his backwardness. Some concepts seem ridiculous from nowadays perspective, but the overall atmosphere is right on the spot. And in this respect I have to say that the original cut has the better ending, because of the contrast, because of all the emotions that are awakened by that contrast, which does not appear cheesy, but rather estranged, a release into the completely unknown."
"Because this was the most boring movie I have seen in years, if not ever. A simple waste of time. Where does all the hype come from? Best sci-fi movie ever? Milestone? Seriously people what's wrong with you? Nothing happems, no development, just non stop boring. Oh wait: young Harrison Ford eating noodles, a snake and some 80's boobies are worth mentioning.I will watch the sequel tomorrow hopefully I won't regret it..."
"Certainly the most over-rated sci-fi film of our time. OK it looked quite distinct in 1982, and the image of a grim future with giant TV screens high above the city was memorable and somewhat accurate for what we see in todays Hong Kong.Plot? There's not much to say, the film contradicts itself many times and the weak and limp tale crawls along.Acting? Ford's OK, Young is pretty and dull, Olmos is cool, twenty years before being cool fighting Cylons, and Hannah is sexy but hopelessly out of her depth.Apologists for Scott's fiasco blame the evil ""suits"" for messing up their Lord's film but in truth the directors cut is worse than the original movie.The sound is badly mixed too."
"This is one of the worst movies ever made. I can't believe this movie has a ""cult"" following.I like just about any movie, I even get enjoyment from the straight to DVD American Pie movies and other B or C rated movies. However, this movie is just awful to watch. I stopped watching it 3 times and kept forcing myself to go back and try to finish thinking it will eventually get better. And while watching it I had my DVD player on 2x speed because its so boring and slow.Avoid this movie unless you want to fall asleep."
"First things first. Best SF movie ever. No doubt.What really amazes me is the top qualification of Harrison Ford in many reviews. And in also many reviews Hauer is not even mentioned.I saw this movie when it was released. The role of Hauer was deeply impressive. And Ford was dim, a bit of a non character.I still have this opinion, Harrison did much, much better in other films. But in this one there was only one leading player: Rutger Hauer."
"Blade Runner has been hailed as a true classic, though when it came out it was blasted at the box office. It was seen as too complex particularly the ending, which was why it was simplified. But over time it has been seen as the iconic sci-fi film of the 1980s.I saw this a few years ago, the director's cut version on DVD and I have to say this film was awful. I found it far too complex but even then I still wouldn't like it. I found it very depressing, overlong and tedious with just endless talking.Though I did like the story from what I could discern from it and Harrison Ford's acting is commendable, but even he couldn't save this. A film I won't see again and I hate but I'm probably in the minority in saying that."
"Spoilers herein.In the mid-seventies, I exchanged a few letters with Phil Dick, who had then dropped his obsession with parallel, valid visions and had developed a similar obsession with created realities. This concern maps well to the wave of film theory that was sweeping the film world, post-Kubrick. Its a sweet justice that this film from his book was sort of a milestone of that philosophy.It concerns a narrator whose recollection of the events may be colored. Some may have happened, some may have been manufactured memories. Within the remembered story are people who fold memories, from the fellow who manufactures replicants, to he who makes `toys,' to the fellow who literally folds. This first use of noir in scifi underscores the matter: noir denotes a coloring of the world, an implied narrator (usually but not necessarily paranoid).What makes this a watershed is that the studio bosses washed all that out of the theatrical release, making the narrator a trusted one by literally narrating. The film was a flop. With the director's reinstatement of the ambiguous truth, it has become a success. And who says the viewing public is too stupid to appreciate multilevel truths? Even people who think it is a simple story sense something deeper.Harrison Ford as a person is completely clueless about the forces that created, surround and buffet him, so he is a natural for this role, probably his best. Joanna Cassidy (Zhora) is a redhead. Great films seem to have more than their share.This camera is highly architectural. The state of the art with effects did not allow much camera movement, so all the perspectives are borrowed from Welles. So it doesn't innovate there, but the emulation is quite masterful. Where it does innovate is in the vision of an alternative (not future) world, but of course you knew that. However, it is worth noting how rare this is.The combination of knotted truths, architectural camera, effective reinstatement of alternative worlds, and the confused projection of self are completely in line with what Dick intended (if not quite what he wrote). And it is enough to place this in the top three of my best science fiction films, and on my list of must viewing for students of visual thinking.Ted's Evaluation: 4 of 4 -- Every visually literate person should experience this."
"Blade Runner is considered one of the greatest science fiction films ever made and it is easy to see why. Deeply thematic, rich characters, a fantastic script and nuanced performances toppled with some of the greatest cinematography ever put on film this is a film version of the mona lisa- every frame can be hung on a wall. Ridley Scott, fresh off the success of Alien is in top form and Blade Runner will be the film he will always be remembered for. Harrison Ford is competent as Deckard and anyone expecting him to be the usual dashing hero will be disappointed. Rutger Hauer steals the show as head replicant Roy Batty. The noir look of the film has inspired so many movies and video games since there isn't really a point talking about it- you have to see it to believe it. One of the greatest films ever made. Period."
"I consider myself somewhat of a movie buff, and several of my friends had highly recommended this movie to me. So a few other friends of mine (who'd also never seen it) and I watched it one night, and we very nearly turned it off. It was not the movie we were expecting, and we were certainly not pleasantly surprised. It was marketed to us as an action film, yet the actual action sequences were few, far between, and frankly rather boring, especially in contrast with Harrison Ford's usual daring escapades. I generally enjoy think pieces, but this one was an exception. I found the plot to be a bit hard to follow, and nothing about it made me want to put in the effort or the second viewing needed to fully comprehend what was happening. For example, the nudity was completely gratuitous, and Harrison Ford gave, in my opinion, the weakest performance of any movie I've seen him in. I don't want to give away the ending, as it seems that most people love this movie, but I felt it was not a good resolution to the story, and that in particular a speech given by one of the characters was trite and not nearly as life-changing as it thought it was. (I've been told I missed the point, and I guess that must be true because I couldn't even find a point...) I personally would not recommend this movie to anyone, although it seems I'm in the minority, so watch it if you want. But don't say I didn't warn you..."
"I rented this movie based on the high reviews here on IMDb. What a disaster! I never write reviews but had to give some warning. Harrison Ford is the greatest Blade Runner ever, yet the only detective work he does in the whole movie is analyze a photo, which led him to the first replicant. The second replicant attacked him, and he was given the location of the last two because they were at the apartment of the scientist they murdered. Wow, if that's all it takes to be a Blade Runner then sign me up. Even the action scenes were drawn out way too long, killing any kind of flow. I'm trying to figure out why this movie rates so high but am stumped. Horrible film. Bad! Bad! Bad!"
"Who knew a film named ""Blade Runner"", a movie with such high praise, could be so boring. TBH, I stopped paying attention halfway though, and surfed the web on my phone. Blade Runner's lone quality is it looks great. As with Alien, it does everything a sci-fi movie should do. Its dark, its detailed, and shows off the culture and technology.Other than that? As an action film, its abysmally paced, with no special scenes or charismatic characters. As a ""deep, philosophical"" film...I don't buy it. You can't support your themes without strong characters. And Blade Runner's entire cast is uninteresting. It may have been intentional for them to be lifeless and robotic, but this movie didn't make me care about machines. Why even bother answering the questions this movie supposedly asks? ""Is genetic engineering ethical? What makes us human?"" Who cares? I don't care anymore after this film than I did before.The noir romantic relationship had zero impact on me. Just as typical and shallow as any other relationship from the genre. But I suppose its okay, since Scott meant to do that. *eye rolls* Its another sci-fi classic that seems like it can get away with anything if its shot well and merely mentions its themes. I'm not going to give it a second chance."
"This movie is extremely slow! I could appreciate that if there was some great story telling going on. However it's not really clear what the hell is going on.Harrison Ford is just walking around looking confused. Shoots a lady that I think was a robot, then he practically raped another robot after she saved his life. You see the antagonist only twice in the first hour of the film. He goes to his creator asking for more life since the replicates only live for 4 years, then he kills him. Seems counter productive to me. Ford's character has another run in with the other lady bot and that was honestly laughable. What the hell was that? Then the showdown with the main antagonist, again laughable. I really was expecting so much more from this film. But I find it really hard to watch.I feel like everyone giving this movie high ratings is clinging to older styles of film making and trying to make this some philosophical masterpiece but I just don't see it. Then there are those saying this is so good because it doesn't use special effects and recent sci fi movies are full of bad cgi. There are plenty of sci-fi film's that have way better story lines and make you ponder life regardless of good or bad cgi. And how does a film not using cgi or special effects automatically make it a good film? This whole story is just blah. I'm really so confused why this has such a high rating. It's in my opinion very tough to watch. I feel like they could have done so much more with this film. Don't get me wrong it is visually appealing especially for being made in the early 80's but that's about the extent of the pros with this movie.I'm watching this movie because I wanted some background before I watch Blade Runner 2049, I just hope the story telling and pacing are better than this one."
"You can only be in awe of this seminal film.Retro showings of the director's cut in the cinema gave me the wonderful opportunity to watch this film in this final cut on the giant screen for the first time. For some reason it brings out so much more to see. I'd watched it on video and DVD on my old home teles, but now for the real experience as the director always wanted.Where should we begin. The inspirational look, the majestic synth music or the existential allegories. No short review can do this film justice. There's just so much to discuss and take from this film. There are no answers, but questions and thoughts.I really recommend this to all. As a tour de force of cinema and sci-fi, it truly is peerless. Can't wait to watch it again."
"Many have praised this one before me, so I will try to keep my comment brief. One of the few movies which still towers majestically over the majority of SF-movies produced before or since. I rate this, along with 2001 and Solaris, as masterpieces of cinema which take the medium to another level. Funny that there are three SF-movies on my top ten movies of all time. In this age of CGI, the environment created for this film has still never been equalled. It is not just the intense layering and detail, it is also the pace which we move through the environment that is just as important. Allowing us time to rest and contemplate the surroundings, along with the magnificent music, brings out so much more atmosphere and sense of place. The acting is interesting, mixing low-key realism with the highly theatrical style of Hauer and Turkel. Yet that mixing never feels out of place. Also, the important ingredient Ridley has in BR that has been lacking in some of his subsequent efforts, is a rich, multi-levelled story. The existential aspects, what is human, real versus artificial memories, the unanswered questions. Almost all movies I consider to be masterpieces have an unanswered question at the end and which brings me back for subsequent watchings. This is one of them. May it soon appear on a Special Ed. DVD with tons of extras."
"Director's cut rules! It's been 20 years since this movie was made, and by far, it is still one of the best films ever. Wisely, no cheesy special effects were used, which could have dated the film. The wardrobe and architecture are a combination of the 1930's, 40's, 50's and beyond, which give it the timeless look that enables us to see the future. There is not one weak performance, and the casting was impeccable. The direction, the vision, the script, the soundtrack, art direction, and casting - all exemplary. Other films have come after it, but this one set the bar so high it has yet to be surpassed.A great short story, (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Phillip K. Dick), and a great film."
"One of my all-time favorites. Despite a few horribly clunky scenes, this movie works on me every time.  Ford is outstanding. Young is better here than I've ever seen her elsewhere, and their chemistry sizzles. Rutger Hauer is amazing. Vangelis soundtrack is haunting and really makes this film's atmosphere. Gorgeous images.  A feast."
"Several years ago I may have read the original story, but don't remember it; and it doesn't matter. The same bleakly powerful message probably pervades both book and picture. The fact is, we are all replicants. The bitter truth is, we have no purpose, except to reproduce ourselves. Whether our life-span last 4, 40 or 140 years, it is as purposeless and pointless as if we were androids. Which we are. It doesn't matter what we have seen or experienced. We will pass and be forgotten, like the rest. It has been noticed that this film contains no families, or children. The need for that traditional, outdated method of self-replication has been eliminated, and people are simply duplicated, in different models, with variations. Memories are routinely fed into replicants, to convince them that they have reality, however spurious. If there ever was a creator, he was definitely killed, for his presumption. There is no doubt that, like everyone else, Deckard is a replicant. The film is frighteningly and permanently effective, for anyone who thinks about it, in every way. It's an image of our actual lives, here and now.Now that I've read the book, and watched ""Dangerous Days"", I learn that Tyrell, the supposed creator, was merely another replicant, which simply confirms what I already believed."
"Vangelis once said ""Music has to be in the moment, not overthought, never to be repeated"" He also said "" To try to make a hit is failure; To make something honest is a success"".Both of these quotes fit Blade Runner perfectly. The making of Blade Runner was chaotic.The nature of the film changed several times before it even got made. Film staff and some cast dropped out. It nearly became a film noir with Dustin Hoffman as the lead. The two stars hated each other, and it was a box office flop when it first came out.The problem with films these days is that they are made by a board room of number cruncher's. A films success is based on box office takings, rather than anything of substance and virtuous accountability.Blade Runner has since made a profit. If it hadn't does that mean its a failure. NO.I can't help but think that part of the reason it was an initial flop was due to the interference of executives in the original release. The Directors cut and Final cut were what the film should of been 35 years ago.Phillip K Dick was a visionary. His books are not the easiest to turn into a film. I enjoyed Adjustment Bureau, yet just like Blade Runner originally, I hated the happy Hollywood ending. Im hoping for a darker directors cut where David and Elise future isn't to assured.I may be slightly biased as Blade Runner is one of my favourite films, but for the Directors Cut and the Final Cut everything just works perfectly together, like a Jigsaw.The tension between Harrison Ford and Sean Young is real, they hated each other. Vangelis was in his prime. The cinematography is stunning. Ridley Scott is one of the most influential directors going. I like that for the Final Cut, it was treated subtly. They didn't over do the CGI, Gloss and mastering.The scene where Deckard 'Retires' Zhora leaves you battling your conscience. A woman was basically murdered in cold blood. Shot in the back as she was running away. All in slow motion with the beautiful ""Blade Runner Blues"" summing the scene up, shining a light on the cold nature of the killing.When I saw the Directors cut, I was pleased that Ridley Scott was finally allowed to say a big Fu!! you to Hollywood. The daring nature that Deckard and Rachels fate is sealed. Living on borrowed time. As well as the ongoing questions. Is Deckard a Replicant ? Did Gaff let Rachel Live ? How long will they survive in the outside world ? Hollywood loves a happy ending. Ridely wasn't having that. As a director he is unapologetic. He hates the politics of Hollywood. He could finally discard the crap footage borrowed from the Shinning, in which we were expected to buy into the notion Rachel was different and built to survive, and they can live happily ever after.The unicorn scene in the directors cut, flips the film over and is the nail in the coffin to lets all dance into the sunset.The final sequence, when the elevator doors close on a forlorn Deckard and Rachel, and the thunderous baseline kicks in then all makes sense. What doesn't make sense is getting up the moment the film finishes and not staying to listen to Vangelis at his best.On a picky critical note: Some might say Deckard is supposed to be detective, but hardly does any investigating. Blade Runner isn't a detective murder mystery film. This is a film about humanity, empathy, equality, compassion, ethics. All challenges we face today.Is one life worth more than another ?"
"I first saw this movie on a rented Betamax video when I was about 8 or 9. It came across as a really sinister and bleak sci-fi movie at the time.  I enjoyed it as a young kid, but guess I didn't really understand fully the themes behind the movie. I saw the vastly superior and definitive Directors Cut many years later and I instantly rated it as one of the best movies ever.  And this is why:To fully understand how good this movie is, you have to put it into the context of it's era.  When it was released it broke new ground and became what is still up to this day an unrivaled benchmark in sci-fi cinema.It was the first film to depict with such lavish splendor the nightmarish vision of future Earth.  Set in post apocalyptic Los Angeles, the film tells the tale of Deckard (Harrison Ford), a semi retired cop who is persuaded back into his role of a Blade Runner (special units trained to identify and kill outlawed androids, or ""replicants"", who illegally return to Earth). His task is to hunt and destroy a band of off-world androids, led by Rutger Hauer, who fight their way back to Earth to confront their maker, the ingenious Tyrell, head of the monstrous Tyrell Corporation.The film is dark and broody. The photography is exquisite throughout and Vangelis' musical score is a now a classic masterpiece in itself.  Director Ridley Scott's melancholy vision is so stylish and smooth that the film is able to emerse you into its chilling future world from the very first shot. Visually, this is one of the most gorgeous films I've seen.Deckard's character is similar to that of a film noir private detective. He comes across as a somewhat washed up and helpless soul lost in the polluted rat race.  This film provides Rutger Hauer with his defining moment on film, a role I think he has failed to live up to since.  With his fellow replicants, he seeks answers that only his creator can provide - all replicants all built with a lifespan of only four years and they are determined that their fate can be altered.The reason the film is so popular is that it asks so many probing questions which, in 20 years of movies since the film came out, have rarely been asked since.The themes look at humanity and the meaning and life.  Should we really create ""people"" and choose their fate and mortality?  If we choose to play god then we must be answerable to those who we create.  Is there any real difference between life created naturally and that in a laboratory?  And so do we really now what we are?  Or why we are?  Or who created us?The film is inspired by the Philip K Dick novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?""  Although this movie introduced me to reading countless Dick novels, I've deliberately resisted reading this one.  Consequently, I can't comment on how it compares although I know the book is substantially different in places.The movie is quite slow paced, although ""smooth"" is a better word.  Die hard action fanatics might not like this film although sci-fi lovers will embrace it instantly.  In the current age of computer generated effects this film is looking only very slightly dated, but that shouldn't put people off.  Even now, the ambience of Blade Runner is still unsurpassed."
