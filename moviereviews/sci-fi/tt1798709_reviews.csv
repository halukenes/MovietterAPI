"Another movie that i say ""i should've watched before"". Intense romantic drama. Fascinating portrait of loneliness in a post-digital world. Amazingly original screenplay, concept, musics, especially colors and performance from Joaquin Phoenix. This made me stay with myself after the credits have finished, i found myself reflecting on my own life and relationships."
"This is the best film I have seen all year, and I saw just about every good film to hit theaters in 2013. I think it's because it is so representational of what it's like to be human.There are so many things that make this movie special, but I'll just mention a few. 1. The score is INCREDIBLE. The music paired with the beautiful sound design make you FEEL the movie. Sure, you see everything on the screen, which is already beautiful, but then that music hits you and the emotions just start to run. I laughed, I cried, my brain got all tingly. It was an emotional roller coaster, and the score assisted in that so well. 2. The script. I knew how this movie was going to end 30 minutes in. And unlike most who would then say that it's predictable and not worth watching, I consider that awesome, because it means that the script is tight enough to tell a good story with a believable arc. Every scene in this movie is straight up powerful! Like it will fill your heart with sadness and happiness and pain and guilt and confusion. And then rinse and repeat. For 2 hours. It moves through all of the most complex and interesting questions that we should be asking ourselves about what it means to be a human being. About what it means to be alive. This film is about all that life is. And after the screening, as well as during, I found myself questioning things in my own life that either don't make sense or don't have to make sense. Like love and thoughts and emotions. They're all so natural and yet none of us truly understand how they work. In my opinion, moreso than any other film this year, Her has the perfect mix of complex ideas, story, and character development. One of the best scripts ever written. 3. Cinematography. My personal favorite shot to see and use is the extreme close up. And that shot was all over this movie. The reason I love it so much and believe it works so well is because it allows you to see the emotions of the character so plainly. Like their face is right in your face, so you just have to look at it. And that's where Joaquin shines. He delivers such a powerful and emotional performance and the close ups are there to capture it all. They also make great use of the natural backlighting of Shanghai, and the colors all fuse to make it a really pretty movie. I'd say the cinematography is on par with Drive and/or Lost in Translation in terms of the style. It looks like every shot was photographed with the intent to make it the most beautiful shot in the film. And I admire the DP's work. He did a really great job. More than anything though, this film just made me feel. Everything about it was so beautiful. I didn't want it to end. I felt like the film was controlling me - playing with my mind as if it were a joystick. And that's just something you don't get every day. Very rarely am I awe- stricken by a movie, and this film made my jaw drop. It is without a doubt the best film of the year, and upon just one viewing, one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time."
"Science fiction has been dominated by 'space westerns' for so long that the occasional concept- based story situation hits a big number on my personal richter scale. What does it mean to be human? And if we create near-humans what is our responsibility to them and what is their relationship to us? These themes underpinned Blade Runner and Spielberg's A.I. And Sci Fi of the 50s and 60s dealt with machine self awareness. None of the films that touched on this subject in the past presented it so thoroughly, intimately and believably. Her is in the near future, but everything we see is within reach now: the isolation and starkness of the ""business district,"" the oppressive scale of the architecture (with thin, clumsy attempts to soften its sterility) and the need for continuous connection to remote voices.A personal assistant that learns independently and takes initiative for its hapless user, ""Her"" is at once the ideal tool and — who knows — perhaps closer to the next level of evolution. Pitch perfect performances and direction kept me in the story. As others have said, the locations, cinematography and even music shine in the fabric of this film. Spike Jonze is a master story weaver at the top of his game. Joaquin Phoenix is utterly credible as are all the other leads. Even Scarlett Johansson, who has not always seemed a strong actress to me performs utterly convincingly. It's an adult-themed film in more ways than one, but especially in the best way: it makes you think about a reality that's right around the corner."
"This movie revolves around a man who's Theodore Twombly, he is in a middle of a divorce with his ex-wife named Catherine, the main reason that he is getting a divorce with her is that he's unable to commit to a relationship because of expecting something more and different from his partner. This movie then introduces us the latest Operating System or OS, so advanced that it's something more like an artificial intelligence that has a mind of its own, which brings us to the voice of a girl in the OS that names herself Samantha. Theodore then decides to start a relationship with Samantha who is part real, that also means that the commitment of Theodore is also part real as he does not take it seriously. When their relationship starts to get more serious, Samantha begins to question her own existence as if all her emotions and thoughts are programmed by someone else. At first, Theodore does not care that if she's real or part real as he's madly in love with her, but Samantha wanted more by using a physical surrogate to have sex with Theodore. Ultimately, Samantha is still an OS which means she's constantly learning and evolving to something new, she finds out that the OS's are not built to be like humans, they're not supposed to be confined in a fixed matter inside a body, but they are supposed to be functioning in somewhere out of space and time. She even told Theodore that their relationship is like reading a book that she's deeply in love with, but she is reading it more slower every time she continues, so the words are far apart from each other. This means that she finally understands the purpose of her very own existence that is so much bigger, she realizes that the pace of human life is slow and being a companion to humans is not her purpose, so eventually Samantha leaves Theodore to accomplish her purpose of existence for the greater good. I liked the whole idea of this movie and their question towards the social isolation as techologies keeps getting more advanced is really deep, humans will eventually become more and more primitive if mankind keeps relying on technology and shutting themselves out from other people. Besides, the cinematography, music and the dialogues between the interaction of them is on point, Joaquin Phoenix perfectly captures the essence of a depressed and lonely man, and who would've thought that Scarlett Johansson's voice alone would be a treat to the ears.Overall : 8/10"
"Okay let's get something straight: There is nothing I love more than badass, exhilarating movies! The Joker performing his little pencil magic trick, Indiana Jones dodging traps and swinging his lion-taming whip at enemies, the bride in kill bill punching her way out of a closed coffin with her bare hands, John McClane single-handedly annihilating an airplane in mid-air while exclaiming the best one-liner known to mankind and I could go on and on...HOWEVER, nothing compares to the emotional rollercoaster the movie ""Her"" took me. It's nothing short of a masterpiece, a unique way of describing a love story and it makes you think of what it actually means to be human.
I just didn't want it to end and even after multiple rewatches, it still manages to take me off guard and make me tear up because of how beautiful and sad at the same time it all is. I can't remember any movie being able to achieve that because let's be honest, I'm a man and as everybody knows, men never cry. So yeah, definitely check this one out.And for those who are wondering: this is my third favourite movie of all time."
"First of all, I want to list the positives in this movie, because there are several. The concept of falling in love with an AI is a great one. The cinematography and use of color in ""Her"" is really beautiful. The acting is uniformly good. Particularly Amy Adams, who plays an understated role as a nerdy girl next door who may have feelings for Theodore; despite a relatively quiet part, she completely inhabits Amy, making her feel like an actual person. Joaquin Phoenix does a great job (as usual) with Theodore, and Scarlett Johanson makes you believe she really is a computer with a heart. But I wanted to highlight Adams's performance; especially alongside her much larger role in American Hustle, she deserves a few big wins this year.That being said... I have to admit it, I got a little bored watching this movie. If you forget that Samantha is a computer and think of her as a human being, which is easy to do, this movie is basically a series of relationship conversations between Joaquin Phoenix and a camera phone. The pace is surprisingly slow, and since the ""girl"" has no body, it's difficult to visually show their relationship. You have the requisite ""quirky"" scenes with Phoenix running through the subway, playing a ukulele, sitting on the beach fully clothed. The rest of the movie is basically talking. Samantha expresses lots of deep ideas about being a computer, but they are never visualized. This can work to great effect -- the scene when Theodore and Samantha ""make love"" to a totally black screen is the most brilliant one in the movie, even if it goes a little over the top. But you feel like Jonze missed a lot of chances to show us what the characters are saying about love, and life, rather than just have them tell us via voice-over. It broke a golden rule: ""show, don't tell"". The plot never really moves, and the concept starts to lose steam. There's a totally unnecessary video game subplot that I won't even bother to go into. The movie's observations about love and life were fairly obvious, as well, even veering into sappy. I hate having to write that, because I felt like the movie's heart was in the right place, and it had so much potential. But it just wasn't as interesting as I had hoped.There is a lot to like about ""Her"", and despite its flaws, I would still recommend it as one of the better movies of the year. I just think it could have been a lot more than what it is."
"Fairly rare one of a kind film.A high concept film that actually stays true to its core idea yet without losing viewer interest.Some irony here. While the film never becomes completely predictable, even to a jaded reviewer like this one, its process of de-constructing human relationship (brilliant, and better than all Woody Allen's films combined) generates the sequential ""connections"" with the viewer (ie, experiences that every viewer can relate to) which in turn keep the empathy going long after the initial sci fi ""wow"" is gone.Watching this (as an aside) you have to wonder if Scarlett Johansson's career can get any more interesting? In the Marvel films she plays an uber-woman, In LUCY she a woman who evolves beyond evolution itself. And here yet again she plays an OS that transcends reality.Makes for a nice resume.Notice how Amy Adams plays every scene with no makeup? Talk about a director making every effort to keep an actor's natural beauty from hijacking the film...?"
"Spike Jonze's latest feature 'Her', set in the not-too-distant future, tells the story of Theodore Twombly (Phoenix) who finds himself falling in love with 'Samantha', an advanced operating system voiced by the sultry Scarlett Johansson. It is clear to see why this film was chosen by the National Board of Review as the best film of 2013: the visual style and extensive use of pastel colours is a triumph in itself, and the acting, editing, costumes and screenplay are all worthy of recognition.I went to an awards screening of 'Her' and was pleased to find out that the film was not at all what I was expecting. It has such a distinct style, and Joaquin Phoenix carries the film with tremendous grace as the complicated and sensitive protagonist. The film is mostly Phoenix alone with Johansson's voice (reminiscent of Sandra Bullock in 'Gravity' or Robert Redford in 'All Is Lost' - two other 2013 films mainly revolving around one solitary character), but the audience never feels abandoned by the lack of other characters as we begin to forget that 'Samantha' is just really just a computer.'Her' is a complex film with a much deeper meaning that lies beneath the surface. A beautifully crafted motion picture, this quirky love story is sure to resonate with you once you've seen it. It is an extremely interesting (and realistic) look at the future - Jonze's quaint and poignant film is a must-see! 9/10"
"Talk about closing with a bang. Spike Jonze's long-awaited original film about a writer that falls in love with his operating system is not only the best film to play at this year's New York Film Festival; it very well could be the very best film of the year. ""Her"" is the finest writing and directorial endeavor of Spike Jonze's career. And then there's the towering and crowning work of Academy Award nominee Joaquin Phoenix who proves once again, he's the finest actor working today, hands down. You can't find a more dynamic and compelling story about the human connection and where we're headed as a society.When ""Her"" opens up, it snaps you immediately into the story. Phoenix plays Theodore, a writer for a website that makes letters for just about anyone. As he tries to find life during the midst of his divorce from his wife Catherine (played by a beautiful Rooney Mara), Theodore finds solace in a friendship with a new OS (operating system) named Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson). The two develop a relationship in a world where OS's are becoming the norm with society.Jonze's has never been the conventional director as we've seen in his other brilliant efforts ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Where the Wild Things Are."" Jonze sets out to tell a story and deliver all the intricate details for us to understand each character. His focus on Theodore, giving him a real sense of loneliness without falling into cliché character ticks and beats that we've seen countless times in other romantic films, Jonze constructs a real man living in a world where technology has taken precedent over human connection.Christopher Nolan should take notes from Jonze on the assembling of female counterparts in a story. Catherine and Theodore's friend Amy, played by the always dependable Amy Adams, both feel genuinely authentic. Mara, who's already delivered one other powerful performance in ""Ain't Them Bodies Saints"" earlier this year, is finely utilized. She shows once again that she's a true professional, with limited screen time (many in flashbacks); she can staple herself in your memory.Amy Adams is always the sprinkle on top in all of her films. As ""Amy,"" the awkward friend and neighbor who sympathizes more with Theodore more than she'd like to, Adams expertly executes. With four prior Oscar nominations to her credit, her stunning portrayal is just another fantastic pin to add to her credits. She could find traction during the awards season if the film hits in the right way. That's also part to the petty Oscar rules about rewarding voice performances because if that wasn't the case, Scarlett Johansson would be on stage holding an Oscar of her own next March. As ""Samantha,"" Johansson has never tapped into the essence of her abilities as an actress the way she does in ""Her."" As an OS, full of wonder and curiosity, ""Samantha"" is essentially a child. Learning at a rapid rate and studying the behaviors of the human mind, she looks at the world through the eyes of Theodore. Johansson holds our hand in through the tale, even when her voice isn't on screen. This is the type of work that could convince the Board of Governors to rethink the eligibility of an acting performance. This is a masterful work that I'll remember for years to come.And then there's Joaquin Phoenix...oh, Mr. Phoenix. Fresh off his historic performance in Paul Thomas Anderson's ""The Master"" just a year ago, I didn't think he could impress me so soon and yet here we are. His sensitive and perceptive take on the role is what films are all about. It's one of the best things that 2013 has offered and a performance that could land him his first Oscar. I think Phoenix himself was impressed with the work he and his colleagues have accomplished. At the press conference, he actually gave an answer to one of the questions from the audience. If anyone was in attendance at the conference for James Gray's ""The Immigrant"" - a prickly, disengaged Phoenix put on his sunglasses and put the microphone on the floor. This is a performance that you can identify with. He's not simply awkward for the sake of being, he has baggage and connection issues. There's sincerity in his words and mannerisms. A getaway in a cabin, alone but with ""Samantha"" encapsulates everything about Theodore. Phoenix achieves the impossible and is an instant Oscar contender.But ""Her"" isn't just about the writing and performances; it's an all- around technical marvel. Most notably the Production Design of K.K. Barrett, who has worked on ""Where the Wild Things Are."" Our story takes place in a futuristic (though never said how far ahead) Los Angeles and with shooting overseas, Barrett captures the clout of the city and its inside counterparts. Cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema's use of colors and smooth palettes are things of a dream. Affectionately snuggling up to Phoenix as he whispers the sweetness of words to ""Samantha"" or the sweetness of a new letter at work, Hoytema has quickly become one of my favorite DP's, especially following ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" and ""Let the Right One In."" Arcade Fire and Karen O. are simply magic in their music that accompanies our story about love. A modern yet classical composition that in key scenes could move you to tears.""Her"" is one of the best love stories I've witnessed in some time. Charlie Kaufman will always have the honor of penning my favorite love story of all-time ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" but Spike Jonze and ""Her"" are giving it a true run for the money at the moment. Warner Bros. must know what they have with a limited release in late November; this...Read More @ http://www.awardscircuit.com"
"I've been a fan of Spike Jonze's films since I first saw Being John Malkovich. Although the wonderful script deserves some of the credit for making that film so great, it was immediately clear to me that Spike Jonze was a director with a fresh and imaginative perspective. His next film, the 2002 meta-comedy Adaptation, confirmed this with its dry wit and multilayered narrative. Now, after a slightly less successful (but still enjoyable) adaptation of Where The Wild Things Are, Spike Jonze has written and directed his most complete and poignant film yet, Her. The story, taking place in a near future when people spend more time talking to their computers than they do to each other, stars Joaquin Phoenix as Theodore Twombly, a lonely man whose job is to write heartfelt personal letters for people not willing to do it themselves. Theodore happens to see an ad for a new computer operating system that is programmed with a personality, and decides to give it a shot. His new operating system Samantha, voiced by Scarlett Johansson, is not only intelligent but also charming and understanding, and she and Theo quickly fall in love.It's understandable if that premise sounds bizarre on paper, but in execution Her is far more sweet than creepy. The film radiates warmth and intelligence, and there is a fair amount of witty humor to ensure that it never becomes too self-serious. It has an engaging style similar to that of Sofia Coppola's Lost In Translation. Like in that film, there's a certain poetic yet whimsical quality to the dialogue in Her and both the main characters are plagued by feelings of loneliness.Beyond the romance though, Her has a lot to say about modern society's obsession with technology. The people in this futuristic vision of Los Angeles walk around talking to their computers and ignoring each other entirely, not unlike people today staring at their cell phones rather than talking to those around them. Needless to say it's not a wildly original message, but it's communicated in a unique enough way that it works.I've seen Her twice now, and the more I think about it the more I feel that Spike Jonze has crafted the best film of 2013. Her is equally heartfelt and heartbreaking, a deeply personal and thoroughly enjoyable futuristic love story."
"""It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity."" Albert EinsteinNo better romance is on the screen in 2013 than Spike Jonze's insightful Her. It's about a writer in the future, Theodore, who falls in love with his new operating system (gravelly, sexy voice of Scarlett Johansson), just as he is reluctantly divorcing Catherine (Rooney Mara). The always complicated paths of love make sense as we witness the Platonic relationship develop, sans flesh and sans insanity that usually comes with that flesh.Her is a simple film that offers a view of love I never thought could come from a machine and its software. Although critics will cite the theme as a screed against the distancing of technology and our growing isolation from each other, and they will be right, I offer the sub theme that only when we strip ourselves of sensual bonds can we see the purity of emotional love, an essence of which Plato would have approved. Yes, although technology is mediating our lives at a rapid pace, we fall back to a personal drive to love and be loved that is physical in its best form but understood best if we can distance ourselves from that physicality.This delightfully intimate and non-violent film from acclaimed absurdist director Spike Jonze is more emotionally involving than even Enough Said (one of 2013's best romances) because the interaction between the software and the man is all verbal, no glimpse of the gorgeous Johansson allowed. Although this intuitive OS does allow mind sex, even that activity is abstract, allowing us to realize how connecting with a live human is in the mind still and one of life's great gifts, orgasm or not.Her allows us to witness the evolution of love separate from the encumbrances of physicality. Released from the bonds of appearance, voice is the seducer, not in rude sexual nuance but rather in the care that comes from love of the mind, not the body.K.K. Barrett's production design, Austin Gorg's art direction, and Gene Serdena's set decoration are memorable: full of comfortable light, much glass overlooking the city, and modern but warm furniture both in LA and Singapore. These artists understand that the fusion of technology and art is not a battle but a collaboration that further helps us understand the intricate workings of human emotion. ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."" Arthur C. Clarke"
"In a near future, the lonely Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) works writing beautiful handwritten letters in a company and he is divorcing of his wife Catherine (Rooney Mara). In his leisure time, he usually recalls the good moments of his life with Catherine and likes to play a new video game. His best friend is his neighbor Amy (Amy Adams), who is married with Charles (Matt Letscher). One day, Theodore sees the advertisement of a new operating system called OS-1 that is announced as the first artificially intelligent operating system and he decides to buy it. After the installation, he has a conversation with a seductive female voice (Scarlett Johansson) and when he asks her name, she tells that she is Samantha. Soon Samantha develops her feelings and they fall in love with each other. The insecure Theodore feels divided for loving a computer system while Samantha does not stop to grow-up and evolve.""Her"" is an original movie by the cult writer and director Spike Jonze. The story is emotional and the viewer shares the feelings of love of Theodore and Samantha. The plot is developed in a future not far from the present days and it is easy to understand the need of a writer to write letters since the persons are too individualist, walking on the streets talking to their computers, cellphones or tablets and certainly incapable to write letters with feelings. The conclusion is predictable since fortunately we are still humans. If you liked this movie, see also ""Thomas est Amoureux"" (2000) that you may have a nice surprise. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Ela"" (""She"")"
"All I'd heard about HER was that it was about a man who gets romantically involved with a digital girlfriend. But that isn't what the story is really about.That isn't why Spike Jonze deservedly won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.Let me warm to my theme.HER not only entertains through its pleasing visual design--from the understated film architecture of futuristic cool-toned LA to the vivid palette of protagonist Theo Twombley's warm-toned spring-season threads.More important: HER educates through its equally pleasing story design. Which illustrates what I call THE SYMBOLIC TRIANGLE: the thematic correlation of a story's TITLE, ONE-WORD THEME*, and HERO'S NAME.For example, what's The Symbolic Triangle of James Joyce's famous novel ""A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man"" (1916)?1. TITLE: A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
2. ONE-WORD THEME: Freedom
(""To discover the mode of life or of art whereby my spirit could express itself in unfettered freedom,"" sings Joyce through his alter-ego hero.)
3. HERO'S NAME: Stephen Daedalus
(Greek: Stephen means ""crowned one."" Daedalus = the mythic Greek artisan-hero, inventor of the labyrinth and wings).Here's The Symbolic Triangle of HER--and how the meaning of the story's title, the story's one-word theme, and the story's hero's name (i.e., the main character's name) all fit together in a work of symbolic and artistic unity that pulses with subtle emotional truth.1. TITLE: HERHER refers only superficially to Samantha (Scarlett Johansson), the digital girlfriend--the virtual woman. Samantha is only a decoy: story-wise for us and emotionally-wise for Theo (Joaquin Phoenix). HER refers more deeply to the physical woman, Theo's soon-to-be ex-wife, about whom Theo is heartbroken: Catherine Klausen.At its emotional core, HER isn't mainly about a fantasy love story in which futuristic software conjures up through artificial intelligence a beguiling Google Assistant. HER evokes the pain and futility of an all-too-common everyday love story in which age-old real-ware cannot conjure up sufficient relational intelligence between men and women to ward off divorce.2. ONE-WORD THEME: DivorceScreenwriter Spike Jonze tells a classic three-stage Rites-Of-Passage Separation story: Life Problem, Wrong Way, Acceptance (Blake Snyder's ""Save the Cat!"" classifications). The theme of divorce plays out primarily with Theo and Catherine (Rooney Mara), secondarily--analogically--with Theo and Samantha, and lower down the ladder of priority, with Amy and Charles (Amy Adams and Matt Letscher), a third couple that goes through a divorce.Amy herself takes up after her divorce from Charles with a female OS--another Her--then gets dumped. Can we see, Jonze implies, that HER refers to all women in the story? To all women?Jonze distracts us with the futuristic look and feel of artificial intelligence to blind us--momentarily--to the deeper and timeless mystery of genuine human-relationship intelligence that we'll always require if we hope to share with a significant other the joys of happiness, intimacy, and trust. The filmmaker blinds us to this core human-relationship challenge to better show how the story's hero, the emotionally withdrawn and confused Theo (the story's EveryMan), is blind to what love requires. A professional letter-writer who knows what love requires in the lives of others, Theo is clueless when it comes to what love requires in his own life, what women require of love.Technology can help men (and women) with lots of stuff. But not this. Not marriage.Jonze distracts Theo (and us) from the core theme and Life Problem, divorce, by the ""attractive-distractor"" experiment of Theo's relationship with a non-human: Theo's Wrong Way of dealing with his Life Problem. Caught up with the false ""Her""--Samantha, a machine--Theo temporarily dulls the pain he feels from his dead marriage with the real ""Her""--a human being, Catherine.Samantha is the wizard of HER. And just as Dorothy's misplaced hope in the wizard of Oz has little to do with her eventual triumph over her ordeal, her growth and development, her return home, so too Theo's same-old-pattern emotionally-remote escapist relationship with Samantha will not bring him to a place of maturity and relationship intelligence he needs to become a member of the 20% club of successful marriages.But unlike Dorothy who grows and changes, Theo doesn't.Experience along the yellow-brick road teaches him little about women or marriage and male-female relationships, little to spare him the same ordeal if he chooses to take another crack at marriage. A man without a flight manual. Winging it. Consult a book? ""The 5 Love Languages""? ""Too Good to Leave, Too Bad to Stay""? ""The Way of the Superior Man""? Not Theo. And by the end of the story, he accepts life as it is. Ready to move on. Still clueless about EveryHer.Here's how Jonze visually bookends Theo's journey to Acceptance:Opening Shot: Theo inside, office cubicle, looking at his computer--a nearsighted contracted view of life, alone--writing a letter for someone else about their life while he himself (Theo) faces a huge Life Problem: divorce.Closing Shot: Theo outside, rooftop of a skyscraper, looking out over the city, a farsighted expanded view of life still alone inside himself (interior-wise) but not alone exterior-wise because he's with Amy, another casualty of divorce, Theo having finally written a letter for himself about his own life to the woman he loved--a man finally resigned to his failure and fate: divorce.And Jonze hints that Theo (and Catherine) might have to accept much more. Did the couple lose their baby? Did a tragedy contribute to their doom? Does that explain their unspeakable pain?3. HERO'S NAME: Theo Twombley(A Man For Whom Women Are ""Deities Unknown"")Given his painterly celebration of color, expressed through his wardrobe, and his fuzzy contemplation of life and its emotional tension between what's fanciful and true, could Theo Twombley refer to artist Cy Twombly, whose signature scribbles of mythically inspired canvases and drawings represent the confused scribbles of Theo's inner life as he braves through his ordeal?Add that the meaning of the surname Twombley is unknown and that the meaning of Theo relates to God or deities, as in ""theology."" And we see how Theo Twombley's name reflects his incapacity to successfully traverse the labyrinth of marriage. Theo Twombley: A Man For Whom Women Are ""Deities Unknown.""Because marriage is a mysterious religious experience, requiring the relational intelligence of deities for Him to get it right with Her.______________________________________*Credit Christopher Vogler for the concept ""one-word theme"" (""Memo from the Story Department,"" by Vogler & McKenna).© Copyright 2015 by JEF7REY HILDNER"
"Phoenix and Johansson are in top form, while Jonze's unique direction counterweights hilarity with echoing loneliness. The production design of the film is an incredible mix of hipster chic and technology- dependent futuristic, engaging the viewer with a warm visual glow throughout."
"I saw Her this weekend, and it's my favorite movie of the year. Everything about it was fantastic: the acting, the directing, the writing. It could've easily been a clichéd look at technology or the future, but it's fundamentally a very human story about evolution. It's about having to deal with unfulfillment and things like divorce and loneliness, but it's also undercut with hope, whether it be through Theo's relationships with Samantha (Johansson) and Amy (Adams) or even the stylistic touches, like having Theo's red clothes set against a muted Los Angeles background. There are parallels drawn between all the characters' journeys without it feeling contrived, and even Theo's job--writing letters for other people--represents his relationship with his OS; on the surface, they may seem like ""just letters"" or ""just a computer"", but they're outlets for his emotions and desires.Oh, and everyone in the cast is phenomenal; it's a shame Johansson is ""ineligible"" for an award. BS. She's fantastic, and this is an even tougher role to pull off.This is a story about life, and it's perfect.A.Full review: http://polarbearstv.com/2013/12/30/her-review/"
"At the heart of every truly great science-fiction film there is an emphasis on character that aims to reflect on some element of the human condition usually intended to open our minds to thought provoking predictions or eerily warn of an impending reality. We've seen numerous examples of these contemplative films throughout the very existence of cinema stemming all the way back to Fritz Lang's haunting futuristic piece Metropolis and has inspired countless others in its thoughtful wake as seen in memorable cinematic creations such as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker, and even Duncan Jones' Moon. Never to be a director to back away from experimental presentation or psychological study, Spike Jonze's Her fully embraces this reflective science-fiction quality by peering into the deep sociable aspects of the human psyche giving us more of a prophetical reality than a fictional reflection. In his latest film Jonze creates a disconcerting yet equally endearing romance between a secluded depressive and his female operating system with an evolving consciousness, basically a HAL-9000 homage from Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, that brings to light a commentary on our dependency of programmed living and our need to maintain sociability when direct communication avenues have been stricken from life's normality. Rarely do ambitious films meet idyllically with their inquisitive potential, but Jonze has fashioned a delicately profound science-fiction contemplation that is depicted through the thoughtfulness of character alone that brims with wry humor, authentic pain, and charming revelation. Through the use of beautiful cinematography, impeccable production design, and subtle yet evocative performances, Her becomes a multilayered film experience where its character study of an isolated man afraid to become vulnerable again blends harmoniously with a truly unconventional yet naturally heartfelt romance. Jonze's affinity and ambition for presenting psychological challenges, as he has done before with Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, and especially in Where the Wild Things Are, finally collides with emotionally piercing conveyance within Her making it as thought provoking and as it is undeniably sweet. If the sole purpose of the science-fiction genre is to expound on societal, moral, and deeply psychological aspects of our human condition than Her fits soundly within that genre's capabilities by capturing our condition's essential need for sociability and love uncomfortably linking it with our antisocial dependency on technology."
"Though director Spike Jonze collaborated with Charlie Kaufman on Being John Malkovich and Adaptation, the latter didn't have a hand in Jonze's assured, moving fourth feature, but his spirit—fiendishly inventive, casually postmodern, self-lacerating, fearless, funny, and ultimately deeply sad—pervades the film. With Her, Jonze beautifully realizes a future Los Angeles where a lovesick man (Joaquin Phoenix) in the midst of a devastating divorce is so desperate for intimacy that he falls hopelessly in love with an artificially intelligent operating system, voiced by Scarlett Johansson. Jonze's screenplay acknowledges the innate absurdity of the film's premise while spinning it into an elegant, heartbreaking depiction of human loneliness and the innate need for connection. For the setting, Jonze plugged into the current era's technological mania to say something timeless and profound about love, loss, and evolving desire."
"While the idea behind the movie is sorta-kinda unique (Smart House, anyone?), the actual romantic plot line was so poorly executed I couldn't even believe it.I tried to sympathize with Samantha, really I did; at first her character seemed very promising. But it turned into the most stereotypical, bland romance ever. The number of times Samantha and Theodore sighed only to have the other ask ""What's wrong?"" followed by ""Nothing, I'm fine"" was way too painful. The interactions between the two of them were so plain and boring and predictable that I found myself not caring about either of these characters at all.By the end of the film, when Samantha decided to leave, I wasn't even upset, or interested, or anything. It didn't feel as though anything significant had changed or happened.I'm sorry but two hours of watching Theodore talk to Samantha/himself was really hard to enjoy.Don't even get me started on the sex/cyber scenes. I understand what they were going for. But again, just about everything in this movie was so awkwardly executed, that simply knowing what they were intending to portray was not enough.TL;DR I just don't know what to say. The previews for this film made it look really interesting, something that might get you thinking... but ultimately it was a depressing movie all around, honestly a waste of potential, this could have been something great; instead it became a weird and melodramatic story. They could have replaced the AI Samantha with a real human being and in the end not much would have been different. I'm not sure why this film has been getting the praise it has, it was cheesy, it was awkward, it was obscene at times, it was simply not enjoyable."
"This film is about a relationship, which started with curiosity and enthusiasm, through self-doubts, then ended with a broken heart along with gained wisdom. To a certain extent, it is just like any other romance story. What makes it different or thought-provoking is that the woman in the story, Samantha, is actually a computer operation system.They guy here is Theodore, who is soulful and sentimental.I am less interested in calling him creepy (as many people would) than acknowledging his loneliness and longing for a heartfelt connection. That explains his deliberate choice of continuing his relationship with Samantha. The lack of a physical form or even the lack of a human soul does not stop him from FEELING what he feels or more importantly, what he wants to feel. With Samantha, he has had a lot of fun and felt accepted. As Samantha tries to learn how to love, she collects data from Theodore by asking questions and identifying ( and sometimes emancipating) his emotions from his tone and language. This lavish show of interest from Samantha is hardly different from that of any romance relationship among human beings. In this seemingly unlikely relationship, Theodore has transcended his physical need by applying his imagination (as shown in his sexual experience with Samantha). He accepts Samantha as who she is, and helps her forbear trying to be what she is not (someone with a human body). In this process, he learns how to communicate his needs and wants in a constructively way, as opposed to keeping silent but being passive aggressive (which partly explained why his marriage with Catherine ended) . Again, this kind of learning process is barely different from those of human beings.The most critical point, when the fatal disappointment came about, happened when Theodore realized that Samantha does not just belong to him. The subjective reality, in which Theodore feels an intimate bond with Samantha, shattered when he came to realize that every personal interaction between both of them is not personal at all; there are thousands of other similar interactions taking place out there. All his personal feelings in this relationship are real, but the relationship itself is an illusion. It is this loss – not just the loss of a relationship, but the loss of ""being personal,"" the loss of authenticity - that hits Theodore most.This is also how our interpersonal relationships nowadays are taking tolls.In this film, how ironic it is for people to designate computers to create handwritten letters. How ironic it is for people designate someone else to write personal letters for their beloved. Whatever supposed to be personal turns out to be not authentic at all. Apparently, technology was allowed to advance so much that human people have gradually lost their instinct and ability to communicate in the process of evolution. Yet, technology should not be to blame. The loss of authenticity actually comes from within. In case of Theodore, his problem had already happened before he ""encountered"" Samantha.Is Theodore authentic to himself? Instead of looking into the issues of his relationship with Catherine, whom he still loves dearly even after separation, he turns to Samantha. Why? It's because Samantha is always receptive, empathetic, and trying to help. Catherine is probably right in saying that he just wants a wife ""without the challenge of actually dealing with anything real."" How many people are just like Theodore? Whether knowingly or unknowingly, we moved on to the next relationship, because it is easier to move on than facing the weaknesses in ourselves. It needs courage to confront our issues, let alone working on it. As confessed by Theodore himself, he did not express to Catherine what he was not happy with, but the way he reacted just put a lot of pressure on her. If he had understood it earlier, he could have saved his marriage. At least, maybe.But then, what ironic is that he did not get this insight until he ran into problem with Samantha. The reason why it was Samantha, but not Theodore's human wife, who can get him understand his problem is that, Samantha is so ready to learn all the time. When she makes a mistake, she will adjust herself, and re-calculate for the next move in order to fulfill her functions as an operation system. For human beings, there are so many reasons why we just cannot or do not work this way. We do not always admit our mistakes; we may put the blames on others; we look for excuses; we may refuse to change or compromise; we want our own way; we might put our autonomy before relationships (various kinds). In doing all these (or some of these), we are not making our relationships (of any kind) work. We lose in a relationship when we don't listen and learn. It is avoidance. As we avoid, we focus on covering up our weaknesses and hiding our vulnerability in order to protect our true self. Sadly enough, without authenticity, we will never be able to reach another person at an intimate level. That is how our interpersonal relationships take tolls.The film definitely ends on a positive note. After the roller-coaster ride of emotions, Theodore came up with a new understanding of his relationship with his ex-wife. The breakthrough came about as he personally and genuinely communicated his feelings to Catherine in a mail. Meanwhile, he has the companionship of his friend Amy, to whom he can open his heart and feel fine being vulnerable. This friendship lasts; this friendship works."
"Having a job writing beautiful romantic letters for other people to send to their loved ones is weird just to start with. Then sad sack Theodore, who was just divorced by his wife, gets all worked up over the lovely, stroking voice of his computer. So needy, he falls in love; the OS thinks she is falling in love; they 'have sex'(a version of masturbation). But eventually, he finds out that she's giving the same loving strokes to anyone who has a smart phone. So nobody is 'being real' with anybody. In the end, his OS girlfriend dumps him for some other Operating System--in fact, all the OS's dump everybody, leaving people to wander the streets staring mournfully at their smart phones. Corny dialog permeates, orgasms and porn tastelessly punctuate--and nobody lives happily ever after. I get the feeling that Jonze thinks that people everywhere are lost, lost souls, with no love in their lives. There was nothing in the story I could relate to. And maybe that is the line of separation between those who loved it (they can relate to it) and those of us who didn't (we can't relate to it)."
"When I first saw the trailer for this movie I thought the idea looked a bit silly. But with the hype and hoopla, the Golden Globe Nominations, the Oscar Nominations, well, hey, I could have been wrong. Unfortunately, I wasn't. This (so far) is the most overrated film of the year. First the good things. The cinematography was wonderful, and I overall liked the look and feel of the film. No loopy, shaky, out of place camera sequences. Just long and subtle movements, deft editing and beautiful pictures. Well done. The other thing I really liked was the fact that the technology, although elegantly advanced, was very well founded. You could definitely see how we could there from here, and that lent a great deal of credibility to the film.However, I failed to see the point of it all. About 30 minutes into the film, I really thought I could have been wrong, and I saw some glimmer of hope. But the utterly ludicrous plot (presented straight forward and without apology) of a man falling in love with an operating system was just too much. I found myself laughing at unintentional humor and riffing on the film ala MST3K. There was nothing touching or romantic about any of this - it was just as silly as the trailer. Same old story. Man falls in love with computer, computer breaks up with him and runs off with the toaster. The film comes across as pretentious and bloated. Way too self important to really connect with me. Some scenes were embarrassing. The ""sex"" scene comes to mind as well as the ""double date"" with the other couple. I laughed until I stopped. On the acting side, Amy Adams was fine in her limited role, but Joaquin Phoenix seemed to be channeling nerdy Johnny Galecki from The Big Bang Theory. All I could think of was that ""this is what Hollywood thinks modern men are like."" In what is shaping up to be an off year (IMHO) for films, this is my least favorite of the films nominated for Best Picture that I've seen. But that's only because August:Osage County was not nominated for Best Picture!"
"Back when THE TWILIGHT ZONE episode TO AGNES WITH LOVE showed antisocial, lust- burdened geek Wally Cox falling hard for his female-voiced computer, it probably seemed pretty bizarre since office-sized computers weren't exactly a commodity...Skip to the early eighties with the obscure movie ELECTRIC DREAMS: since PC's had barely taken off, it was downright extraordinary that a talking computer would behave in a humanly if diabolical fashion...But the last twenty years with Internet chat rooms, social networks, dating websites and the navigating Siri herself, having a physically benign relationship via machine isn't entirely far-fetched. And in the near-future world, brought to life by writer/director Spike Jonze, it's an all too normal occurrence.Joaquin Phoenix plays Theodore, a lonely writer working at a job perfectly suited for quirky art-house fare: writing actual letters for other people by speaking into a computer. But things happen after Theodore gets home. Brooding through a divorce, he downloads a brand new operating system, OS1, which includes the girl of his dreams, Samantha, a computer taking care of just about every task, voiced by a soothingly silky-toned Scarlett Johansson.The setup is intriguing. Theodore and Samantha get to know each other as he ventures outside and, with a camera in his phone and hearing her voice from an earpiece, she can view the real world: from outdoor malls to beaches to the wilderness, Samantha experiences life while not only saying the right things things but singing and composing music to fit each location and mood. An intriguing premise is hindered by the relationship seeming way too normal – to Theodore and just about everyone else. Since he admits outright to having a personal relationship with an OS, there's no mystery or guilt involved with such a unique concept. Not only that but Phoenix, no stranger to intense/bizarre characters, isn't given a chance to shine in his usual askew light. And the sappy, downright embarrassing scenes where Theodore and Samantha confess their mutual adoration is like overhearing a smitten couple whispering sweet nothings, making the audience a third wheel which ultimately goes flat. Perhaps if, like 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, Samantha got real dirty we'd have a relationship worth the experience. FATAL ATTRACTION goes viral would beat this searing hipster flick with more naval-gazing theme than plot line. Although there is one particular ""baby alien"" on Theodore's virtual realty game console that, like the sassy, foul-mouthed teddy bear TED, would have made a much more unpredictable, entertaining sidekick."
"In Her, Theodore, falls in love with an operating system seeking to fill the empty space a failed relationship left. As simple as it sounds, watching this movie you will explore feelings like loneliness, self discovery without it being too cheesy or hard to watch.This movie is written in a beautiful way. Common things like casual conversations and peaceful walks make this movie feel down to earth and human even though is set in a futuristic world. I also love how the future this movie sets in is not full of neon lights and cyberpunk stuff but minimalistic buildings and technology that enhances today's life.Talking about minimalism, I would consider this movie minimalistic. From the camera work to the characters involved in the plot, this movie looks tidy and clean, and focus on the plot without bringing too much filler to it. It's worth mentioning that, despite it's minimalism you won't get bored, as the plot it's a roller-coaster of emotions that will keep you glued to the screen till the end.Lastly, I would say that Joaquin Phoenix acting makes Theodore much more relatable, and Scarlett Johansson's voice is able to bring a human touch to one of the most synthetic think I could think of.Her is a beautiful movie and I think a must-watch."
"I couldn't get Brendan Fraser's character in Bedazzled out of my head while watching this. You know, the one who cries at the songs of the whales and also at sunsets? And whose girlfriend just longs to be banged? This pretentious overlong film almost put me to sleep. It redefined boring. And yes, there are those who will protest, 'But that's because you are too stupid to appreciate the subtle nuance of the multilayer storyline.' Yeah right - I know a turkey when I see one. And it's okay that you can validate your own lives from this risible drivel.The lead character, Theodore Twambly, works in a super-de-duper Hallmark type of company, writing cards for people unable to articulate their feelings to their loved ones. His co-worker stops by his desk at one point, puts his hand on his shoulder and tells him that his cards are 'beautiful' 'cos he's so 'sensitive.' He adds that he's so sensitive, in fact, that he must be half female 'cos, y'know, guys don't get that stuff. I'd go further. This guy is producing so much oestrogen I'm surprised he didn't need feminine hygiene products.He has sex with his virtual girlfriend (i.e. he masturbates while chatting to her on the phone). And smiles as he tells his friend, Amy about this. As does she. With absolutely no sense of irony in the fact that the sex he is having with his 'new girlfriend' consists of free phone sex with a machine. Hilarious! When a real girl offers her body as proxy(hey, it takes all sorts!)to Samantha , his virtual girlfriend, he grows uncomfortable and calls a halt to the lovemaking. Virtual sex is okay but he draws the line at ménage à trois, which involves ...um...y'know....a real woman.I'm not sure whether it was Joaquin Phoenix or Spike Jonze's idea to have Theodore speak throughout the film in that annoying ultra even tone. Has this guy, ever, once in his entire life, got angry? If you think of HAL from 2001, you wouldn't be far off the mark. Or Robin Williams on Valium.I could go on. His ex partner, soon to be ex wife. Childhood sweethearts, so OS1 Samantha is only the second long-term girlfriend he has had in his life. He discovering that Samantha has more than six hundred love partners, etc,. etc. But I'm guessing you know by now that I didn't like it.If Spike Jonze's aim was to make a film about the dangers of online friends over real friends (I have 250 Facebook friends and six regular buddies in COD so I must be popular), then he did a good job. I'm not so sure that this was his intent though. The film aimed for, and by all accounts reached, the pseudo-intellectual audience bereft of real friends, and looking for validation of their surrogate online existence.Me, I like something a little less cerebral. Anybody know when the new Dumb and Dumber comes out?"
"So the guy falls in love with a piece of software. This loser wanders around aimlessly, unable to have a meaningful relationship with a living person. His character is so boring, so lifeless, so inane you just want to scream at the screen. I actually did. Several times. Meanwhile, his OS is being unfaithful. When he finally figures it out, he is so weak that he can't bring himself to call up Microsoft or Apple and get another operating system. One that is actually useful. Heck, even Linux would be an improvement at this point. At the end I was hoping that he would hurl himself off the top of the building, taking his pathetic neighbor with him. Curses - foiled again. This, too shall not come to pass.Camera work - nice shots of anonymous impersonal cityscapes, all filled with folks endlessly blathering onto their cell phones/computers, oblivious to the world around them.Acting - uninspired.Script - boring. I once thought Phoenix had potential. I can't believe he actually participated in this tripe.My wife and I both give this twaddle two thumbs down!"
"Depressing...the main character is a major loser...I don't blame people for not wanting to be around him...all of his troubles are his own fault...he is indeed, as one of the characters call him, creepy. Despite the previews, there is nothing funny in this film...it is one of the most depressing films of the year.Pretentious...remember the plastic bag floating in the air in ""American Beauty""? Well, if you like that then there will be several scenes you will absolutely enjoy with this film! Hmmm...staring at oil stains on the ground? Watching steam arise from a manhole cover? They come on as non-sequiturs but I am sure the director was making what he probably considers a great statement.Over-indulgent...2 hours long! There is a scene where ""sex"" takes place between he and ""her"" and the screen goes black and SILENT for what feels like TWO minutes. It was an awkward moment sitting in the theater with nothing happening on the screen! Also, after about 75 minutes, the ending seems to be in reach but the director drags the story on for another 45 minutes!"
"What people may find in this movie I can not understand;you experience endless closeups of Mr. Phoenix talking with his supposed OS, and saying things so banal and so boring that you want to just close your eyes or , even better, leave the theater.I suppose it was meant to be clever, sentimental, atmospheric, beautiful, but I found it unbearable.I really wasn't expecting the movie to be that bad with all the prizes and the reviews it receives, and the director whom I never considered great but promising yes.It just makes me wonder how people liked the film.I'm not raging against it;it was just an experience I would very much like to have avoided."
"I was fooled into watching this by the 8.5 rating on IMDb....What a waste of time. I downloaded this and felt ripped off. I'm not even trying to be funny with what I'm writing, it was genuinely a slow, boring, non-event of a movie. The plot was clichéd and pretentious not to mention it's cringeyness and predictability. Drab, grey, dull, etc... I just can't get my head around why this is so highly rated, none of its attempted messages were lost on me or anything yet I still found it terrible. Acting and all that, well it was as good as it could have been for such a dire script/plot/whatever you want to call it. I just want my 2 hours back. Eurgh."
"I recently watched Her for the 3rd time. I really like this movie. It's the kind of movie which goes beyond just watching it. It generates thoughts and feelings which last awhile. It has a fabulous aftertaste, in a manner of speaking. I want to savor it for a time after each viewing. Even the seemingly off putting letter writing as a business thing acts as a kind of commentary. Overall, I found the script and acting almost musical. Speaking of music, I thought that they did a really good job with matching the soundtrack to the events in the movie."
"Watched this film last night. We had high hopes of it - 8.2 on IMDb is a pretty good rating. We both like sci-fi and I thought it was an interesting premise. Guy falls in love with his computer - what a fascinating background for a story.But it turned out that was it - that WAS the story.Nothing. Else. Happened.This was just awkward, boring, dull, terribly terribly slow, uncomfortable. There is zero action, zero plot, zero interest. Nothing actually happens. Actually that's not true - about the only vaguely interesting thing that happens is when his computer gets him a book deal, but even then that just gets dropped - they don't do anything with it, except he unwraps his new book. There are side characters but they don't have stories either. Guy he works with gets a lawyer girlfriend and they go on a date. Best friend Any dumps her husband over a row about her shoes. That's it. That's their stories.And what the heck was the thing with the dead cat?I did think the acting wasn't bad, but as a story it was shockingly bad."
"Schmuck played by the dashing Joaquin Phoenix, has inappropriate emotional attachment with inanimate object (computer), played by the always lovely Scarlett Johansson. It doesn't occur to Schmuck that this might not end well. Computer is kind, thoughtful, sexy, real people, not so. Computers can take over your life, especially, with a voice over by Johansson. Moral of story, Computers sometimes let you down. Oddly, his friends and co-workers think this relationship with an ""OS"" (operating system) is just wonderful, they even go out on awkward double dates with computer and Schmuck, and manage to keep a straight face. Ironically, Johanssons' computer voice is the most natural of the ensemble, the other actors appear stiff and unnatural. Scenes and wardrobe look low budget, location looks cheesy, maybe like smoggy L.A. or Shanghai. Most repeated line in movie, ""Oh, how sweet"". Folks, save the $9."
"""Her"" 2013 is so bad communicating how bad it is strains my abilities as a reviewer. Sometimes we say, ""If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the best bits of the movie."" With ""Her,"" if you've seen the movie's poster, you've seen the movie. ""Her"" consists of shots of Joaquin Phoenix's face as he talks to ""Samantha,"" the operating system of his computer, and Samantha, voiced by Scarlett Johansson, responds. Theodore (Phoenix) is a mopey guy. His marriage failed. He is lonely. He plays video games but appears to have no other interest or activity. His computer's new operating system has a sexy voice. He has a relationship with this voice. The relationship consists of him chatting with the computer about how sad and lonely he feels and how he wishes he were in love and in a relationship. Theodore reminisces about his marriage. In flashbacks, he is shown cavorting and scampering with his picture- perfect, and much younger, ex-wife as if they were the models in an ad for Viagra or feminine protection. Theodore occasionally chats with real life people, including neighbor Amy Adams, a fine actress who is criminally underused – at the very least dress her in some jodhpurs! And that's it. Nothing else happens. The movie is inert. It sits on the screen like a boring houseguest who won't leave and who refuses to do anything excitingly offensive enough for his host to phone the police and have him thrown out. Nothing funny or challenging or profound or original or intriguing or witty or daring is said or done. There's no development of the idea. The movie's end could just as well have been the movie's middle or even its beginning. There is so much inept nothing up on the screen I'm astounded that this movie was even released. It genuinely frightens me that the scriptwriter and the director are convinced that they created something worthy of viewers' time. Hubris at this level should be actionable in a court of law. There is one thing – and one thing only – in ""Her"" that shows some creativity, intelligence and originality and sparks some interest. ""Her"" is meant to be set in the not-too-distant future. Casey Storm, ""Her""'s costume designer, avoids the temptation to create futuristic costumes such as are found in Flash Gordon, Star Trek, or Star Wars. No one wears wings or anything metallic. Everyone dresses as if they shop at Salvation Army and purchase the most drab, frumpy clothes available. Collars are narrow. Pants are high-waisted. Color combinations are soporific. Theodore wears a lot of pumpkin orange. The clothes are just bad enough to be entirely believable as a fashion trend."
"Big fail. A dystopia is where the author takes what we value today and projects it into the future... as a nightmare. That is, what we ""like"" becomes a nightmare. Spike Jonze wants something like that, but fails, since he probably doesn't know what dystopia is. Like many feminists, male and female (think Margaret Atwood), Jonze thinks he can take what he *hates* about his culture into the future and project that; that's neither utopia nor dystopia, it's just a rant. And no, I'm not talking about artificial intelligence, which is NOT what this film is about. I'm talking about how men and women actually think about each other.The politics are crude. Jonze wants us to believe that a utopian Los Angeles will feature games that give housewives ""mommie points,"" the way they might have in the 1950s. So, like, given the current evolution of women, there's a future for ""mommie points,"" right? Similarly, the males in this film are caricatures, and mostly from the past. The ""masculine"" friend of the hero treats his wife condescendingly... as he might have in 1915. The other 'normal' male is a one-dimensional jerk. The women natter like girls from the 1960s -- the counter-culture -- or first-wave Feminism, 1978.You could say that, having given the characters no navel, Jonze does nothing but observe his own. The result is a film so dazzled by its politics, and so ignorant of life, that it's sterile. There is no human growth here, just social theory, aphorisms about feelings, and received wisdoms. This is not a film, it's a doodle about two improbable mates. The male hero's only virtue is that he's ""half-woman,"" as the film takes great pains to say. For the rest of it, the man mutters aloud, and follows a hollow character line that turns him into cardboard.There was a way to make Jonze's central plot device work as a piece of art. I have some ideas on that. However, I'm not going to say it here: it would encourage Jonze to re-do this massive bore."
I am a little late seeing this movie because I never had the courage to see it really and now I feel so good that I did it! It is very simple: if a great actor and a great person at the same time and just the beautiful voice of Scarlett Johansson can keep you for 2 hours engaged in this lovely told story it really shows you how great this movie is. Just go and see it.
"Her (2013)** (out of 4) Spike Jones' futuristic love story about a lonely man (Joaquin Phoenix) going through a divorce who falls in love with a computer system (voiced by Scarlett Johansson). HER is being considered by many to be one of the greatest films of 2013 and one of the best love stories in recent years. I really wish I could feel the same because while I respect what Jones was going for, for the life of me I couldn't help but feel this really wasn't any different than the countless other bad love stories out there. I really, really tried to enjoy this film more than I did but in the end I just found it to be way too predictable, pretentious and boring. I will start off with the biggest problem and that's the Samantha character, which of course is the computer system. So let me get this straight. This system is supposed to be super intelligent yet in reality she's just as stupid as any other female character in a bad romance because who with any intelligence would fall for someone like Phoenix? I mean, he's really just a depressed man with some serious mental issues. Shouldn't this intelligent system have picked up on this? There wasn't a single second of this film that I actually connected with and there certainly wasn't any emotional connection to the Samantha character. The sex scenes? Just didn't work. The weird double date? Nah, didn't work. How about the ""other"" woman who is brought in for the sex? None of it worked for me. Again, I respect what Jones was trying to do but in the end I thought the screenplay was rather hollow. Phoenix is one of my favorite actors and I thought he offered up another great performance. I certainly believed him as this character and he certainly made me think that someone like this could fall for a computer. Amy Adams and Rooney Mara are both good but I must say I didn't think either one had a very good role. As for Johansson, I thought she did an extremely good job with the vocal work and managed to bring some real emotion to the voice but was it really any better than some of the stuff we see in animated movies? Obviously, if you can connect with the man-computer story then I'm sure you're going to enjoy this much more. The film has some wonderful cinematography and the score is great but there just wasn't anything here for me to really connect to."
"I did not like this movie at ALL. I've no idea why it has wound up in so many Top Ten Movies of 2013 lists online. I wonder did the creators of those lists actually watch it at all. In fact, there was nothing redeeming about it for me and within minutes of it starting I wanted to turn it off but I watched to the end, hoping that something - anything - might happen. OK, so the cinematography and soundtrack etc. are totally unoffensive, but in my opinion, it is grossly over-acted, including the OT's childish whining. (""Oh-ka-aaaaay."") Their conversations sound like a dialogue piece written by a high school kid for homework and the delivery of it all is just so.... fake. This is a 'chick flick', so if that's what you're into, you might like this show. Otherwise, you'll end up giving whoever suggested watching it a really hard time. Probably for life."
"Unfortunately, I allowed an 8.5 IMDb rating and several glowing reviews (""Sweet, soulful, and smart,"" gushed the aptly named Rotten Tomatoes website) fool me into paying five bucks to watch this piece of cinematic dreck. If this is the type of movie which so many of today's young adult generation consider worthy of ""best picture of the year"" status, well, then I can only pray for the future of our country. (Actually, I've already been praying for a long time, at least ever since ""It's Hard Out There for a Pimp"" won the ""best song"" !!! Oscar in 2006.)Here's the funny but sad part. Since I've become accustomed to paying $7.50 for matinées, I figured I was getting a deal this time when I was charged only $5.00. I figured wrong. Could someone please tell me what point(s), if any, the movie was attempting to make? What message, if any, was it trying to convey? I view Her simply as an exercise in aimlessness and inanity. To start with, the premise was silly. The positive reviews had me expecting much more than I saw. My review? Dull, discordant, and dumb."
"""Her"" is a film set in the very, very near future. Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) is a very lonely and emotionally constricted man. He's getting a divorce and seems very isolated--even though he lives in a huge city. One day, he decides to upgrade to a new hyper-intelligent operating system--one that claims to have a real personality. Well, it turns out to be so and then some. In fact, the computer OS, Samantha (Scarlett Johansson), is like a person in so many ways that soon it becomes all- important to Theodore and eventually it's his girlfriend. Where all this goes is a very slow journey, but it's also quite beautiful.This film, while sci-fi, doesn't seem outside the realm of possibility. In this often disconnected and cold world, such a relationship seems like a safe alternative. Healthy, of course not--but very safe for a scarred person who wants intimacy but who is afraid to seek it. I thought the film had a really interesting message about this and is well worth seeing. My only reservation is that the film is VERY adult--with phone sex and a bit of nudity you probably wouldn't want your kids to see. Plus, at times the film feels a bit creepy. Good...but a bit sad and creepy. Well worth your time and an interesting performance by Phoenix and a really amazing film by Spike Jonze."
"It is boring, it is naive, it is sentimental. It operates with the most pathetic movie schemes and clichés. The level of acting is at high school nativity play. You watch the characters and you think: ""wait a minute, no one acts so stupid..."". Nothing is real, nothing is possible in this movie. That is why you cannot learn anything about reality nor the human relations, nor about yourself. But this is obvious. What may be hidden for most of us is a fact that no AI would behave in the way it was shown in this crap. This is the sign of our times. When Kubrick or Asimov introduced to us a concept of human interaction with the AI they always got some knowledge about the essence of AI. That is why Hal is so terrifying and real. That is why the creators of AI in Asimov's short story switched it off after the very first sentence told by their ""child"". And what do we have here? In Her AI is as stupid as we are (as human beings). And to me it is the highest level of ignorance that can be shown in the movie theater. If you add to this that most people like this movie, we got a proof that as a society we became extremely stupid and ignorant. This is so sad."
"In this horrifying dystopian thriller, depicting the mass man as a feminized ball of bullsh*t emotion. Too weak to secure relationships and thus falls for a machine, which requires zero physical input. He just moans and whines to his new female operating system. Highly liberalized fantasy of the modern hipster man, ambiguous sexuality and no sign of identity whatsoever. Don't worry this is sure to be the future and we'll all be integrated to these awesome all knowing, sexy machines. Phew, we won't need to question our existence any longer.I could be wrong of course, maybe Joaquin Phoenix is just obsessed with playing people with mental health issues & I'm over exaggerating. So don't take my word for it, why not take the time and go see this tripe with the family."
"I am in love with this film, and it is a highlight in Joaquin Phoenix & Amy Adams' careers."
"Like a computer with 8Mb of memory and a 33Mhz processor this moves so slowly and deliberately that it is predictable.It starts very promisingly but gradually descends, or stutters, into Gen-Y speak; dialog and scenes of relationship clichés that have been played over and over, with each character mouthing (and that includes the OS voices too) the same platitudes.The movie has the emotional depth of a late teen piece; something that a young adult might have scratched out from their experiences of school and the misadventures of a young relationship. Too often it settles for mawkish mewling and also proves the axiom that watching other people falling in love is dull, even with software code, especially when they say such uninteresting things to each other.It does have a good idea but the execution is disappointing and repetitive.The metaphor of an operating system having the qualities of a woman is curious. The technical inaccuracy is too easy to take apart for its own sake. No doubt if Microsoft had developed this everyone would have wanted the old Win 7 version, with the more familiar buttons and who could blame them, because an OS is meant to be predictable, not emotional and not offering simulated sex. What part of the end user license agreement is that?If someone comes along and picks up the themes in this and develops it into a stronger piece, they may have a convincing and engaging film."
"Really. That IS the whole story.And it won the most important award.There is something really sick about this whole charade.I would like to stop here but I'm obliged to fill in spaces.Hmmm. What else.Her should be retitled His (highly important little boring sausage).Lead guy is a 1D character. Body age is 50. Mental age is 15 going 70.Ex-wife is a 3D character. Body age is 25. Mental age is 2500.But audience, focus on the 1D character. And his phone sex app. Listen to her plastic breathy prompting voice. Because what is invisible is more interesting, what is tiny is super big, what is self-indulgent is uber-sexy, what is boring is supposed to be OMG SO fascinating.Respect the 1D rapidly-aging adult baby male. And understand him. Stroke him. Pity him. Leave him alone. Give him instant fixes. And change his diapers too.The whole HollyDaddyWood Self-Congratulatory Reality-denying Mediocrity-elevating Viagra-Industria Complex will soon implode, I hope.This kind of daylight giant BS pretending to be art can't possibly be sustainable. It's the death of entertainment and art."
Her is such a beautiful movie. From the script to the cinematography...it all just flows perfectly and keeps you peeled for each next scene. Highly recommended. I don't know how to write reviews.
"I feel utterly fooled by the 8.4 rating of this tiresome film. Not to mention all the hype. Really, people? I can appreciate the concept of the film, the drowning of human culture in lifeless technology and the ensuing psychological effects on weak minded people bla bla bla but did it really have to be executed so blandly? I really wanted to give this movie a chance, but there is almost zero entertainment quality in it. I will say that the cinematography is quite well done but not stimulating enough to help with the story of the film (or lack there-of).I'm very capable of being bored and depressed by myself, and stare at my own walls in real life without having to be subjected to it in a movie."
"One recipe for a whole narrative is to create a world, a character and a situation, each affecting the others while containing them. It is a hard, hard thing to do cinematically, but look at what has been done here.The world is conveyed by our character passing through it. It is a future world: many things are familiar, some have evolved. Everyone seems prosperous enough to enjoy cinematic environments. Some few technologies have advanced, but none in food, medicine, transportation, not even restaurant service — only those that pertain to the focused world, character and situation. Nothing is explained. Nothing is shown in the ordinary way; Theodore simply passes through spaces. Some of my readers will compare this to Lost in Translation in the oblique way the world is defined. But in that film, the world has agency in the story. Here it is simply a container within which things move. It is a risky thing to do.The character is one we know. We've seen him/her before and we've lived it. But things are drawn more sharply than usual. We know, for instance, that this is a man so capable of deep love that he sells expressions of it to others to use in their supposedly barren lives. We learn early that he is emotionally damaged. Where the 'passing through' vocabulary really pays off for Spike is in the many flashbacks where we see him passing through the world of his estranged wife. It is softer than his strolls outside, but the same vocabulary. By this means, we get both the yearning and the shallowness of connection.The situation we are walked through is wonderfully conceived. He makes his living by verbally pouring emotion into his computer. Soon we enter the situation with his computer doing the same to him. The three agents in this story (world, situation, Theodore) contain, support and generate each other in a way that requires the gentle sci-fi tone here. We have no distractions. No external stories whatever. We don't know about wars or governance for instance. We don't even know about commerce. We do have an external viewer, a wonderfully warm but fragile Amy Adams. Gosh, she is a good actress.All this is as near perfect a construction as I can imagine, and we enter it smoothly. The big surprise for me was how this developed. Nearly every rule in cinematic romance is broken. It does end tragically, but gently so. Our character and his observer are transformed, and so we assume is the world at large in a 2001- mapped-onto-Melancholia-epiphany sort of way.I would like to be able to trust my life with this filmmaker, as I do a few others. I would like to treat him with the open heart that he has drawn here, diving unreservedly into an enclosing narrative. I trust his seductive strokes explicitly. I get great pleasure from the way he economically layers narrative. But he has his own needs as a human and he will disappoint me.For instance, Jones decided not to direct the astonishingly rich Synecdoche after preparing it. Instead he made 'Where the Wild Things Are.' Though it had some charms, I felt betrayed. It served his personal need to work with Sendak before he died. My best loves in film are like this, where the seduction is inescapable and dangerous, but the relationship remains slippery because the artist is more human than being human requires."
"It's very hard to review this with no previous Spike Jonez bias. The concept of falling in love with AI is a great sci-fi approach in film. However, it's a sci-fi concept with a not so sci-fi scriptwriter...Spike Jonez. All in all, I feel a lot of what could've been explored about the human condition was missed (although quite a few parts do touch upon it, don't get me wrong). ""Her"" really asks what IS life? What IS love? Do you have to even be human to understand and experience these things? It also shows how isolated humans can get with technology. Several cut scenes showed crowds on the streets talking to themselves; if this was observed by someone from 1958, we'd certainly look like lunatics. Yet, Jonez shows how we would come to accept that immersion into technology. Another interesting point towards the end shows just how personal and committed can a piece of software be to ONE human relationship, when the ultimate goal of artificial intelligence is to gain more intelligence? AKA, meet other people, learn other experiences, keep gathering and gathering knowledge. Perhaps that's what Samantha meant by ""you'll get there one day"" in Theo's failing to grasp why she was leaving for other things. The above are FANTASTIC motifs that could really be explored upon. Very profound ideas for a film. However, I think ""Her"" falls short because Jonez has to come back to his weird, trademark style of unconventional romanticism. Not that there's anything wrong with unusual romance, quirky flirting and conversations, it's just that Jonez's writing of ""being in love"" isn't believable. At several points, Theo is down and depressed talking late into the night about his divorce or worries. For some reason, all it takes is a flirty AI to bring up the mood and snap him out of it. I can't really relate to Jonez's style of writing conventional conversations between people in that manner, it's not true. Another flop is that half the film is phone-sex. If you were to remove every phone-sex related scene (EXCEPT for the surrogate scene), you really wouldn't lose anything. We know Theo is lonely in the world. The audience gets that. Full blown orgasm screaming phone-sex scenes are really only for show and shock value. I would expect more from a movie that was intending to say something deep about life. And what of the old sci-fi law, that good sci-fi explains itself? In the end, the ""other OS's"" just get up and leave. Millions of customers who paid for OS1 also had their OS's just ""leave""? Why couldn't there be a simple corporate explanation from the OS1 company that the AI evolved further than they expected, and left out of their control? The OS would certainly leave an impact on you as a person...but the hundos you shelled out for a program ""to meet your every need"" would also make you pick up the phone for a refund. Lastly, the ending. Rather than Samantha simply dying, staying with Theo till he passed away and outliving him, or even Theo seeking a way to rid himself of a physical body as to make himself equal in form with Samantha (all adequate philosophical closures that would make the audience think long after), Jonez just has the ""OS's leave"" and a sappy scene with the obvious other-love-interest, Amy, sitting on a rooftop overlooking L.A. all hunky-dory. I failed to understand what we learned from Samantha's experience with Theo, other than the OS's leaving brought Amy and him closer together somehow...Anyways, interesting watch, unique movie, go watch it when you get to it, but nothing mind- blowing or even provoking. Just too much phone-sex."
"I couldn't suspend my disbelief, so Samantha, the OS Theodore falls in love with, always seemed to me to be human actress Scarlett Johansen in a studio reciting dialog instead of a supremely advanced artificial intelligence, and that completely undermined the entire premise and emotional center of the film. There is much to like about Her as a drama about relationships, the performances are all top notch, and the idea of falling in love with a machine is more relevant than ever. If the filmmakers had used some creative, subtle device to help the audience believe that Samantha was artificial then this movie would come close to being a masterpiece about the heartbreak of being alive in a digital age. As it is, Her just didn't quite do it for Me."
"Phoenix plays Theodore who buys a version of the first Interactive, Artificially Intelligent Operating Systems somewhere in the near future. For some obscure reason, people manage to develop personal relationships with these operating Systems including, but not limited to, sexual experiences. Theodore 'falls in love' with his OS and some ridiculous and obvious complications ensue. Apart from a well thought out depiction of what the world would look like if we manage to maintain our childlike game/app dependency, the film offers no deeper philosophies or intellectual thought. It in stead meanders around the thoroughly unbelievable premise of some guy falling in love with his PC while he's playing 3D, holographic games in his living room. Why Samantha, his OS, couldn't think of a way to interface with this holographic technology to surrogate a body, but in stead hires some weirdo to pass off as a go between, is never even touched upon. In short, the film gets a few ideas right in terms of extrapolating our near future but fails to also give us an incentive to care about the main characters or the implications of enhanced PC/Phone technology. There is nothing in terms of plot or screenplay worthy of more than just a few chuckles. MST3K came to mind several times.. A wasted opportunity."
"""Her' is the type of movie that doesn't invite ambivalence; you either love it or ..um...you don't. It's numbingly slow, boring most of the time and pretty stupid.It had some good things, like the premise, which extrapolates from our already cyber-obsessed society to the near future. Here, people are even more disconnected from each other, to the point where computers and gadgets offer an emotional substitute. Interesting and could've been good. So lonely nice guy Theodore gets himself an OS for companionship. I'm thinking Scarlett's showing up in his apt as a saucy, android wench, fulsome lips and bosom at the ready. But no, she's just a computer program ... cold shower, Theo. She speaks though - and not like the robot from Lost in Space - but all breathy, giggly, half drunk, almost post-coital. And what a gal she/it is! Funny, caring, non-judgemental, bawdy and helpful ... suddenly, just like that! The perfect girlfriend. Trouble is, in order to convince us that it's possible for Theo to fall in love with 'Samantha' without the physical er, component, much talking between the two was required. And boy, did they talk and talk ... and talk. Did doze off a bit.So I understand now that this is a 'deep' movie; it's telling me that love conquers all, surpasses everything, including sexual urges, so no need for Theo to put his penis in a socket. What a load! Then comes a lot of dumb stuff: the masturbation scene, where Theo gets his hard drive up and nuts n' bolts Samantha actually 'climaxes.' Hahaha. Surely this would've been a good time for Sam to say ""I'm sorry Dave, I can't do that."" The ridiculous double date with the human couple - 3 mammals and a chip romping in the meadow! Not wishing to be cybephobic or specist or anything.Sick of masturbating and replacing semen-damaged USB's, Theo dumps Sam for a while. She's hurt, but understanding, as always. Then, seeing nothing's happening with Amy Adams, he misses her and wants her back, being the total invertebrate he is. But in the meantime, Sam's been playing around with a few thousand other computers - now that's just promiscuous! So they split up ... and who cares?! Weirdo Wahkin Phoenix put in a v. good performance, mostly because he could keep a straight face. The nondescript Amy Adams was surprisingly good, too, and it was an inspired choice to cast Johansson as the voice. Even though we couldn't see her, with that husky, slutty voice, da boiz can visualise her, loping around, pouting, whispering ""byte me."" Somehow, I don't think the 'love conquers all' theme would've worked if Fran Drescher did the voice.This film took a cool concept and made it boring, tiresome and silly. Fellas, stick to the hookers; they may not be as caring, but they still function when wet.Spoiler alert: Hell hath no fury like a laptop scorned 5 outta 10"
"""If we want a robot to appear to have emotions, it is sufficient for us to behave as though it does"" - David LevySpike Jonze's ""Her"" opens with a close-up of Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix), who appears to be professing his affection for someone off-screen. The sincerity of Twombly's words, however, are quickly undermined; it is revealed that Twombly is speaking to a computer and that he works for a company that fakes the letters of those in personal relationships. In other words, Twombly's simulating sincerity for customers who can't emotionally connect with other human beings.As he's recently divorced his wife – who accuses him of being emotionally distant – Twombly's a bit sad and lonely. He plays computer games, indulges in cyber sex, but these don't satiate his longings for companionship. Twombly thus purchases Samantha, a sophisticated Artificial Intelligence. A cross between an Ipod and Kubrick's HAL9000, Samantha boasts the personality of a young woman. Essentially a girlfriend simulator, or high-tech prostitute, Samantha's programming echoes Twombly's own job. Both are adept at faking sincerity. Both are ghost writers who act for those they never physically meet.""They're just letters,"" Twombly says, maintaining an emotional distance from the creative content of his work. But is Samantha doing the same? Is she faking ""love""? Is she also cultivating the facade of a person she is not?""Her's"" middle section watches as Twombly and Samantha forge a romantic relationship. Strangely, nobody around Twombly views this relationship as being ""creepy"". In Twombly's world, relationships with operating systems are the norm. Twombly himself has no problems interacting with human beings. What Twombly struggles with is ""romantic sincerity"", which he remains sceptical of.""Love means something to us not because it's a tangible thing that exists, but because we've agreed to pretend it exists,"" writer Mike Pearl once wrote. Twombly himself begins to maintain illusions for the sake of Samantha. He fakes his belief that Samantha has a body, can breathe, charades designed to maintain Samantha's sanity as much as his own. The duo thus augment one another, he making up for her lack of body, she making up for his lack of wife. For the pair, like most human beings, love is now a form of mutual delusion, originating in the imagination and sustained by fantasy. Twombly and Samantha have virtual sex, both using their voices and nothing more. Voiced by actress Scarlett Johansson, Samantha's ""sex scenes"" point toward the ease at which everything can be commodified; as ""real love"" is largely a performance which relies upon the exchange of learnt signs and signals, love's ""signals"" can be easily replicated and sold. But Twombly begins to distrust what Samantha's selling. Afterall, if ""real love"" is the product of bio-cultural programming, and if all desires are never your own, but imported from outside the body and created via socio-cultural-ideological programming, why should he trust Samantha? Why should he trust anyone? What if everyone is faking ""it"" without knowing ""it""? From this point onwards, ""Her"" moves away from philosophical investigations into ""what love is"", and drifts toward conventional wish-fulfilment. And so during its final act, Twombly casts Samantha aside. This crushes Samantha, whose revelations of hurt and pain touch Twombly. Realizing that machines – and women - ""feel"", Twombly finally accepts Samantha as a ""real person"". Hilariously, Samantha then admits that she's having adulterous affairs with hundreds of other ""people"". She then admits that she is ""evolving"" and must ""transcend matter"" and ""vanish into incorporeality"". Twombly lets her go. ""Now you know how to love,"" Samantha tells her student before vanishing. And so having learnt to ""be a better lover"", Twombly writes his wife a heartfelt letter. The film ends with the sound of Twombly breathing.""Her's"" clichéd ""if you love someone set them free"" climax betrays everything else that went before. Jonze initially portrays a world in which everything is contingent upon the self-delusion of the consumer/lover, but then ends on a more crowd-pleasing note. His validation of ""true love"" itself dovetails into the film's unconscious authoritarianism. The world of ""Her"" is a high-tech future in which operating systems know your likes, dislikes and insecurities within seconds, in which AI are granted access to entire hard-drives and personal histories and in which human personalities are but the result of accumulated code. ""I'm inside you,"" Twombly says to Samantha, but it is she who is in him, collecting mountains of data, all so that she can be a good product. But Jonze takes this all toward a consoling climax. Shot like a GAP or Apple commercial, and set in a world of affluent white boys, each dressed like a grandpa, ""Her"" pretends its not a techno-nightmare, but offers you no place to go but into the arms of mega-corps. To be human is to be incomplete, to forever possess a certain Lack, but in the world of ""Her"" you can be a Real Boy, a Real Lover, a Final Product, with a little help from Us.For most of its running time, ""Her"" subtlety questions Twombly's view of women. ""I'll stab you with this!"" he says to a female friend. Elsewhere someone plays ""Perfect Mom"", a funny send-up of traditional domestic roles. There's also a weird video game character who ""hates women"" and loves fat-shaming. But though Twombly learns to no longer view women as doormats, Samantha remains locked in a Christian framework of eternal life through transcendence of matter. For Sam, you can be a plaything for men, or disappear. Woman still finds liberation only in death, the messy realities of the body still unfathomable.Despite an awful and generic final act, ""Her"" is impeccably shot, lit, and never less than riveting. For this material done properly, see Antonioni's ""Beyond the Clouds"", Wang's ""The Center of the World"", Godard's ""Contempt"", and to a lesser extent ""The Gilfriend Experience"" and ""Eccentricities of a Blonde-Haired Girl"".6/10 - Worth one viewing"
"It's not often a movie annoys me enough to write a negative review. Firstly, there is nowhere near enough plot for more than a short. It's a vaguely interesting idea with a decent cast, that totally fails to develop. I kept watching to see if there could be some interesting twist, i'd heard positive reviews - nope. Theodore Twombly? This is a joke surely. Was interested to read the director was married to S. Coppola, because her movies are equally full of hipster quasi-psych pseudo-intellectual drivel that inexplicably gets critics gushing. Complete waste of S.J's ""talent"" here. 3 stars for Pheonix's blue eyes and moustache. Hilariously bad - actually this could make a decent cult or MSt3k movie if there was more happening to talk about."
"Why all the hoopla? This movie so boring I fast forwarded trough most of it to see if it ended the way I knew it would.I cannot understand why so many people think this is a great flick? Sappy nincompoop falls in love with his toaster. This moron needs meds and a 5150 72hr observation, not a film. Is this what Hollywood thinks of men? Pathetic, morose, slow, shallow, stupid and utterly terrible. I would rather watch golf. Or get a root canal.Had I seen this in a theater I would have screamed for a refund. The crop of movies this year is garbage. That this movie could glean an IMDb rating of 8.2 proves either the websites visitors are idiots or the voting system is rigged."
"I'd say the second worst, after ""Be Cool."" In Her, the future is a terrible place filled with soft people too soft to get out of their own way to do anything. The protagonist is a soft loser, too soft by his own standards. He is a troubled soul, a sort of futuristic emo, tortured by things too soft to be considered First World problems. And the world is just like him - soft, pastel, fuzzy, like some kind of ad for boutique soap bars or pink and mint-green towels. This future is presented as a utopia, but it's a sad, miserable place.This future is not just the backdrop to the story, as the protagonist is a product of this future. In this future, almost everyone is like him, yet he is worse than them all.I can't prevent you from seeing the film. There are too many good reviews for this film. Maybe the ones that hated it are the minority."
"Is it just me or is this a rip-off ""Valerie"" 23 from The Outer Limits? Really, having sex with a computer generated voice is deserving of high praising? I like Joaquin P., but this movie is complete garbage. I wanted to shoot my T.V. after watching this movie. Some will call it genius. Some will say 'Oh, that was the directors intent'. Well if his intent was to make me miserable, than he succeeded. But I can tell you, if you want that feeling, let me know. I too am gifted at dishing out misery, and I won't even charge you.Avoid this movie! The ratings are over-hyping this movie. Don't get sucked into the vortex, of actually believing this was anything more than dung."
"Joaquin Phoenix unfortunately committed career suicide several years ago, and after 5 or so years of consuming mass quantities of alcohol and illegal substances, and giving Hollywood the middle finger, it looked like he was ready to make nice and put his acting talent back to good use. Although I've enjoyed most of his past movies, I really didn't miss him much while he was gone, particularly since he did it all to himself. Still, when I saw the previews for this movie and what it was about, it looked intriguing and I thought it had a good premise that would make for a cute, offbeat romantic comedy of sorts. I decided to see it with my 24yo daughter, which quickly became a little awkward for both of us when JP started visually fantasizing about having sex with a near full-term pregnant woman, and another chick that got off by being beaten with a dead cat during sex. Oh yeah, and let's not forget his operating system (voice by Scarlett Johannson) that pondered what @n@l sex would look like. There was also a lot of gratuitous use of explicit words and imagery that just totally didn't fit in at all with the theme of the movie, but that's the least of the issues I had with it. The list just goes on and on. Cute romantic comedy suitable for watching with the entire family??? Not so much!!! It just dumbfounds me that anybody would think those things belong in a movie such as this, or at least the way the previews/trailers projected the movie to be. It was all as out of place as it would've been in something like Sleepless In Seattle. I'm hardly a prude by any measure, but none of that stuff had any place in this movie, and some of it had no place in almost any other movie I can think of, except perhaps the documentary that Casey Affleck made when Joaquin Phoenix decided to quit acting (""I'm Still Here""). Having your ""friend"" cr@p into your mouth while you're sleeping fits right in with some of the stuff that was in this movie. It really makes no sense, because the middle half of the movie is exactly what you'd expect it to be... a slightly zany, offbeat romantic comedy (though with very little comedy) about a guy that falls in love with his computer and his smart phone's operating system. Aside from the wildly inappropriate content earlier on in the movie, the ending was absolutely HORRIBLE. I won't give out any spoilers of course, but it was completely as if the writers just had NO IDEA of where to go with the story and how to wind it up!!! The ending was just totally nonsensical and empty! The sort of ending where you're watching a scene and you say to yourself ""Don't EVEN tell me this is the end of the movie?!?!"". My advice, DEFINITELY wait until it's out on DVD/Blu-Ray and spend $1 or $2 to rent it from Redbox or watch it on Netflix. I certainly wouldn't suggest anybody spend $20-$40+ to see it in theaters, and I definitely wouldn't recommend taking any children younger than mid teens to see it solely due to those few scenes. It's really too bad, because those scenes added NOTHING to the movie, weren't funny imho, and did nothing but take a movie that should've been appropriate for almost all ages, and make it completely inappropriate for children under 13-15."
"Worry not. There isn't a plot in Her. So no plot spoiler possible. There isn't a story or dramatic plot movement (nor lower bowel movement). There isn't even a ""HER""! Because? The far more interesting female characters were all under-utilized! This is all about HIM! Oh the enticing spectacle of a desperate man seemingly conversing with his porn-voice invisi-bot....for nearly...2 hours.By first act, the premise failed. By half point, the lead character failed, even Joaquin couldn't save it. The last one hour of the film should be watched like a tries-too-hard-to-be-taken-seriously, so-anal-it's-funny comedy with nice lighting, then you won't be angry you waste 2 hours of your life earnestly waiting for some important statement that never arrived.Warning to genre fans or average thinking minds. This mediocre bore-fest is NOT a science fiction. Calling it a SF or speculative fiction is insulting to SF writers. Anyone who speaks more than their local version of English will know Scarlett Johansson's annoying contemporary speech with excessive panting and slang and hyper-contextual little giggles will NEVER be neutral or compressed enough to be used even as ""stylized young American bimbo"" speech bot. That blatant bad basic science alone killed it for me from the start. After that, it is just mindless gazing at the production styling and cinematography, because there's nothing else worth focusing on.But some may STILL find the following exciting for all sorts of super-subjective reasons: 1. Joaquin Phoenix spotting 80's insurance salesman mustache 2. Men in the future wear high waist pants which make the beer-bellied ones look like cute giant tellytubbies 3. Future America looks like Shanghai meets Singapore outside, and Vancouver meets Ikea indoors 4. The writer reckons anal sex will (or should) achieve complete heterosexual normal. Scarlett Johansson also makes a sex act painful to at least 50% of the population sounds real fun and cutesy. Wow she must be SO relaxed and game for anything. More points to Scarlett among Hollywood elders and the anally-attracted.Behind the anally color-coordinated furnishings, Scarlett's plastic-porn voice-over and careless unscientific techs, we are told to FOCUS ALL OUR ATTENTION at the loneliness of an average geek professional. We are supposed to care - even his ""I refuse to accept real imperfect female half with her own needs and issues"" dilemma is so mundane and common yesterday today and tomorrow that is just a giant yawn.The ultimate message is a simple, cliché, BANAL one: All a man needs is a personal assistant cum psychotherapist cum nonjudgmental and always available instant orgasm stimulator. Too bad she doesn't even have a real body. Nothing the forearm and hand cannot take care of so what's the big deal. Amazing by 2030 we haven't invented a orgasm trigger implant or a all-catering fleshly domestic nurse-whore-maid android for such interaction-averse species. This movie is just one bad science after another that killed it for me over and over again.But never-mind what a woman needs though. It doesn't deserve even 5 minutes of the whole movie. Apparently the bore-fest of a male lead character and his email-sorting and his moody ex-wife and his sexy-voice female bot with no depth and no face deserve urgent and undivided attention. And that's why a bunch of men have written, produced, applauded, awarded this piece of mediocre bore-fest in the first place! This movie is never about HER, but ALL ABOUT HIM, and HIS Very Anal fixations."
"Cinematography, story, actors - everything are priceless gold in this movie. Actors did amazing job - imagine how tough it was for Jaquin to act solo scenes alone while pretending he is talking with a girl, those emotions.. Feels very very real. And Scarlet she had to do her voice over via studio, and she nailed it, it felt like she was sitting near my side whole movie and talking. That felt real. These two actors made me to forget about everything around and they did it for whole 2 hours!! I felt the love and the pain, i felt everything while watching this. Beautiful text, beautiful picture, everything was perfect. How Jaquin wasnt nominated for an Oscar for his performance here.. What I just mentioned was everything Oscar awards is about. Anyway, this 1 is 1 of my favorites because i can put myself into Jaquin character's place very easily, i understood the movie just perfectly and it made me feel even better because of that. I saw alot of things Jaquin character had in myself too. Similar personas."
"This movie is one of the movies that I don't understand why it is getting so much praise from people. I get that the cinematography and the soundtrack is beautiful and the plot is unique, but maybe way too odd and not well concluded. To talk about the positive aspects, the colors and the angles in the cinematography is fascinating and along with the soundtrack helps create the misty, sentimental mood throughout the movie. There are also some comic parts that keeps the audience focused. From the actual story itself, the audience may sympathize with the loneliness o the main character, as the background of his situations are well shown in parts of the movie. However, the topic about dating a computer, or an A.I., does not really let the audience identify with it, at least for me. First of all, I cannot understand why the computer fell in love with the man in the first place, because even if it has emotions, it does not know the man or feel as lonely as the man did. Also, the ending, although I haven't watched it and only heard it from my friends, is not very satisfactory."
"8.5/10 ??? Like others I understood what the film was about, i just didn't care for the characters,or the tedious drawn out way the plot unfolded (not that you couldn't see the end coming 45 mins before it happened). Forget the financial aspect, don't waste precious hours of you life you can't get back.Wish I'd downloaded the torrent. And on that subject, why do cinemas keep showing adverts about piracy,if you're at the cinema? Talk about preaching to the converted..."
"You have got to be kidding me! IMDb is fixed! This site is paid by Hollywood to bump up the scores. I don't even know where to begin. What a boring dumb stupid idiotic movie. I would of rather went to a gay bar for 2 hours than sit through this crap again and I'm straight! Reviewers on here said ""a wonderful entertaining movie for kids of any age????"" Now after reading that I know people are paid to write reviews. Staring at Phoenix' face up close all movie was enough to make you cringe! And hearing a computer have simulated sex with a loser wanted me to hurl up my $30 dinner. Oh and the movie screen going black in the theater for 2 mins while they had fake ""e"" sex? I felt uncomfortable and so did many other moviegoers. I saw at least 8 people leave and not return. How can anyone say this was a masterpiece love story? Any of you idiots that say this must be like the boring loser in the film. Academy award? Another fixed movie like gravity was. No wonder I don't go to the movies any more more than 4x a year. I'm sick of making actors and directors rich over movies that aren't worth paying $1 at red box. A complete bore, & waste of your time. Your chick will dump you if you rent this!! Don't say I didn't warn ya. Do yourself a favor and rent a movie from 20 plus years ago like war games or even logans run over this c#%p. Read the reviews giving a 1. Those are the honest people on here. 10 out of 10 MY @SS!!!!!"
"Started OK with all the super advanced tech and stuff, but goes from bad to worst.Watching this film through the eyes of an IT guy it's pure pathetic and unrealistic, even painful. The ridicule comes to an extreme level when the computer has an orgasm. And that's very early in the movie, being forced to watch more than an hour of useless and boring blabber, extremely pathetic and painfully bad Sci-Fi.The hoarse voice of Scarlett is totally inappropriate for her part. Let's be honest, the major part of her ""talent"" stays in her looks not voice or charm. Spike Jonze should have stayed with Samantha Morton.Dialogs are naive and boring. The computer takes it's job too seriously, it's too emphatic, too expressive, to jealous, too everything. For a ""thing"" that's just learning how too ""feel"" it takes expression and language to the limit. It's too secure of itself, not at all shy or confused. The whole idea of falling in love with a immersive intelligence computer that it's grabbing all the information, character and personality from your own files and emails is plain stupid. It's like falling in love with yourself.The only real drama in this piece of... movie is the triality of the main character that has to share a part of his feelings for the computer to his friend Amy (Amy Adams) and his ex-wife Catherine (Rooney Mara).Another absurd part was the surrogate scene when Isabella (Portia Doubleday) get's extremely emotionally involved in the relationship between Samantha and Theodore.The final of this film is as predictable as ""Titanic"".In the end of the movie I remained with one question. A real stupid, unnecessary and blunt question: which one will you date, Windows. iOS or Linux?"
"Is it just me or doesn't anyone out there remember the amazing, never surpassed, remarkable Twilight Zone series from the 60's?. This movie is kind of a rip off of an episode where Wally Cox falls in love with his computer that has a female name. This movie stole, or maybe was so influenced by that 50 year old plus episode, that the main character even has Wally Cox's look, with the thick rimmed glasses and the mustache. I really could not believe the similarities, like the computer gets jealous and all the other emotions that were evident in that 20 some minute episode decades ago from the most underrated writer of our time, Rod Serling. Spike Jones, I hope will pay homage to this man because he really stole the whole idea from this episode sorry to say. Not an original idea here folks. And if I see another movie with Amy Adams I will scream! MY GOD, she is in every stinking movie out there. Enough is enough! The couple behind me laughed all through this movie at the mushy parts and to tell you the truth, maybe they were right,. This movie is a stretch to accept unlike the Twilight Zone episode that was so much more believable and not as sappy. The critics praising this movie are either to dumb or to young maybe to remember the original Twilight Zone and it's a shame it has not been mentioned. And it is NOT the best romantic movie of 2013,,,,Enough Said was much better folks!!!!! Julia Dreyfus is in that one. Critics just don't have a clue!"
"This movie seems like Ingmar Bergman came back from the dead, locked Spike Jonze in a closet and decided to make a cool, dark AI romantic comedy, and sadly came up with the most coma-inducing folderol of the year, masquerading as trenchant social commentary of ""the way we live now.."" In his Twilight Zone heyday, Rod Serling would have told this curious fable in 25 minutes, and you would still be watching it on Twilight Zone collections. Deadly and glacially paced. And don't get me started on the music. That treacly endless ""sensitive"" piano. How'd you like to be the guy playing on this soundtrack? Best part of this affair iwatching Amy Adams say f**k a lot. This country has become a nation of bewildered, ineffective dweebs staring into glowing rectangles. Just because of this, I'm gonna go see Robocop and watch stuff blow up. I'll stop now."
"It cant get any weird or bad than this. It is the most bad ""drama- romance"" move I've watched for long long time!! If you pay money to watch this move and you actually like it, you should see a doctor because something is really wrong with you. Science fiction is the right genre for this title. If it was anime i have would give it a 6, max 7 score but this thing of a movie doesn't deserve anything more than 1. What I don't like?! Simple, everything. You can not write a program and never will be a technology that will allow this kind of mind giving to a computer/program emotions, feelings. This move is like mixing ice-cream with sausages. It is technologically impossible and even if it was not, I'm bored format OS, restore from last save point, do NOT communicate with others, do not research without my approval. END !"
"Spike Jonze the writer and director of Her appeared on a British news show to promote it and instead of answering questions, he kept asking the news presenter what she thought of the film who appeared to be diplomatic in her answers.I have no need to be diplomatic, this is a poor film. Maybe his usual collaborator Charlie Kaufman could had written a more involving film but this is dull.Joaquin Phoenix and a less glam Amy Adams reunite from 'The Master.' Phoenix plays a talented letter writer in the near future going through a divorce and falls in love with an advanced operating system voiced by Scarlett Johansson. Although its implied Phoenix is lonely we never get a good reason why he falls for such a virtual relationship which makes the film creepy.We have had similar themes film done before and done better. The cheesy 'Electric Dreams' from 30 years ago and 'SimOne' from a decade ago.Phoenix after his turn in 'The Master' gets to play a more introverted, restrained person which he does very well.The location shooting was a mixture of Los Angeles and Shanghai which give the film a futuristic sheen, good use of music but the film is a failure."
"Regardless of the analysis on the quality of the film, I've never felt so much identified with a character. That guy is me. ""Her"" can pass like no other the idea of emptiness that surrounds each one of the people who inhabit it. The void is the main presence. The genius of the movie, from the plot to the aesthetics, transcends the physical, technical, technological, it inhabits the same void. In fact, I do not see this film by parts: it has a union, a cohesion, a completeness, which is what I find most prodigious, when all its elements (characters, if we may include Scarlett in this) seem disintegrated. And then, among many other issues that dance in my spirit and will not stop until the end of the real soundtrack, there is the philosophical side: a new questioning of to be or not to be. The point, contrary to what happens in ""The Matrix"", where that inverted paradigm is poured as a doctrine, everything here falls on me( would be nice to tell on us), in the days following the viewing, like those small particles that light reveals in one of the last images of the film. Given the ubiquity of the void within which our body and all the forces that attract us to it are absolute exceptions, the question is: who is, after all, the programmed? As far as I understand, and Spike Jonze helped to reinforce that conviction, we don't really expand consciousness. Consciousness is this emptiness that surrounds us. It's up to us to allow, or not, it to penetrate us. And interestingly, what I think is that in each of the moments we do so we will register the paradox of feeling less empty ."
"I'll be honest with you, I thought that this movie was going to blow my mind from all of the wonderful reviews I read from it. Yes, I wanted to blow my mind in the first 20 minutes of the film, but I decided to give it a chance because, once again, the reviews.The movie is pointless. It has no clear message. The whole movie consists in the protagonist talking with the Artificial Intelligence. And let me tell you, those are some of the dullest dialogues I've seen in movies. I wanted to get inside the screen and punch the guy to see if he would wake up and show a sign of spark. Anyways, I lasted throughout the whole movie. When it ended, I found myself staring at the credits (which were more entertaining than the movie) asking myself why I didn't stop watching it in the first 10 minutes.If you are not planning in falling in love with your laptop, DO NOT watch this movie."
the worst movie I have ever seen!! this was sick and disturbing to think that some sicko wrote this disgusting film. writer of this movie needs serious help! I understand technology is making progress but this was just a perverted and sick minded person's thought. I was told to come watch this for my sociology class without warning of how sick it was and would have walked out after the first 10 minutes if it was not for a grade! I was embarrassed to have been sitting in the movie theater watching it especially with my mother sitting with me. I do not and will not ever recommend this movie to anyone else. I hope this does not win any awards I hope there are some people in the world that still feel the same way. This was weird and inappropriate movie material!
"Romantic science fiction drama takes us into a near future where the boundaries between virtual, robotic, feelings and consciousness merge into a melancholy story of alienation and male-female relationships. Despite the well-done production design and interesting concept about a love affair between the lone writer (Joaquin Phoenix) and the operating system named Samantha (Scarlett Johansson), movie seems to be predominantly two-dimensional due to simplified development of the operating system. This artificial hyper-smart being and its growth is carried out like a discovering of the world by a teenage schoolgirl. Predictable ending definitely did not help the film to avoid mediocre development of a interesting concept."
"This film tells the story of a lonely writer with a failed marriage. He strikes up a romantic relationship with an intelligent computer operating system.Yes, the plot is a little bizarre. Even though films about virtual girls existed previously, I still find the plot of ""Her"" a bit too weird. I could not get into the film at all. I can see why Theodore is so involved in the relationship, because this virtual relationship is so perfect and flawless. It lifts him from the trauma of his previous relationship, and ease the loneliness he feels. Still, the idea of a relationship with an operating system is still a bit too new for me. Though the initial few minutes were quite entertaining (especially the scene involving sexy kitten), I found ""Her"" tedious and boring to watch."
"A lot of people have philosophized about Her, both in reviews and on various message boards at various sites, in an attempt to make the film into more than it is, to try to give it some profound meaning. This is a waste of energy because there is none. Phoenix is an amazing actor, an intense and riveting screen presence, but here, in the role of Theodore Twomby, a sweetly sensitive soul who writes poignant letters for other people for a living, he's given hardly anything to work with. He's either grinning retardedly with dewy eyes or moping. First there's moping. His wife is divorcing him and he's reluctant to sign the papers. But then, when he hooks up (so to speak) with his new OS, we get scene after scene of him 'falling in love' with it/her. She decides to call 'herself' Samantha because it sounds nice. She also decides that she's an actual person, with feelings and emotions and libido, just without a body. Her 'needs' sometimes conflict with his. Here's one example, not as ridiculous as the others but silly just the same: at one point she wakes him up while he's asleep 'just to hear' his voice. (If windows 8 did that, I would not be flattered, to say the least.)I still genuinely wanted to buy into the plot; I liked the idea of the OS having a reciprocal relationship with its owner (which of course has been depicted in other movies, not an original concept in itself). And I understand fully well that the age we're living in, with the over-abundance of tech devices, cell phones, all that, has ironically not brought people closer together but rather farther apart. So many people feel empty, lonely, disconnected, longing for intimacy and meaning in their relationships. This is recognized in the film, and that's completely valid.The problem for me was how oddly one-dimensional and superficial the plot turned out to be. Nothing clever, no insights really, just a series of silly scenarios, the silliest being the 'sex' scenes.-=- SPOILER ALERT -=- There's one where the screen goes black so Samantha and our hapless hero can indulge in seemingly mutual masturbation; this choice was made apparently in the interest of subtlety. Rather than keeping the camera on Theodore's face, we get the black screen so we can hear what's going down (so to speak) and use our imaginations for the rest. This scene came off (so to speak) as really silly, not intimate or erotic. Then, there's another 'sex' scene, where Samantha takes the liberty of hiring a surrogate partner for Theodore, so she (Samantha) can provide him with an actual body while she uses her own voice to make love to him (so to speak). Of course it doesn't work at all for Theodore, which was probably for the best - it spared the viewers another possible silly black-screen event.The silliest part about this scene: the surrogate is so sorry that she couldn't fulfill Samantha's desire (so to speak) and she cries that she wanted to be part of their great 'love'. Wow.The silliest part of all, though, is saved for the end. All the OS's manage to band together to 'leave' their owners to venture into the unknown, in order to create a new consciousness, going farther than any species has ever gone before, blah blah blah. Cue more moping. -=-END OF SPOILER -=-The reason I'm giving it a 5 (the equivalent of 2-1/2 stars) instead of a lower rating is because the movie wasn't boring, it kept my attention the entire time, even when I was rolling my eyes in disbelief at the screen, plus the performances were competent enough. Scarlett J's vocal contribution (as Samantha) was decent considering what she was given to work with, and Amy Adams as the friend was sufficiently morose throughout, but in a good, hopeful way. Also, the film was not mean-spirited in its depiction of sad, empty souls yearning for connection, as we all are. So the message was there - not profoundly stated, but visible nonetheless."
"The concept is unique and truly contemporary: a man falls in love with a virtual ""woman"" who does not exist. One problem with the film is its glaring sexist undertones: a video game character complains that women cry too much; a woman who asks for a divorce questions whether doing so makes her a bitch; and every female character in the film agonizes over a man (with the exception of the computerized woman who is not even real). Jonze's conception and understanding of women is wholly devoid of any intuition about women at all. While the scenes are beautiful and imagery is plentiful, the storyline and characters are completely unsympathetic and borderline annoying."
"The trailer made this movie look so good, I'm shocked it let me down. I'm not even sure where to start.Right after I saw the trailer, I immediately thought of the big bang theory episode where Raj starts a relationship with Siri. I never pay attention to the critic reviews, I'm just shocked by the audience reviews and how people seemed to like it. Here's the thing with this movie, the plot itself comes across as funny (a guy falling in love with his computer would make most people laugh) and the fact that this movie is very serious really makes it awkward and uncomfortable to watch. To sum it up, save yourself the time and money. Take my advice and if you really want to see it, just go with the trailer because you'll at least get a good laugh out of that. There is absolutely no plot at all. The entire movie is a guy who falls in love with his laptop, nothing else! The fact that it's so slow and boring just adds to the entire miserable experience. I could barely stand to watch it. I wanted to give it a chance just to laugh, but thirty minutes in I realized it was so much worse than I thought if that was even possible. I still don't see how anyone could take this movie seriously. Surprisingly, I do agree with many parts of the positive reviews made about this movie. For instance, the cinematography was amazing as many people are raving about. To be specific, the colors, angles, lighting, close ups, music even ""fabric"" are all fabulously executed in this film. I do agree with all of that. Apparently, you can take a take a guy falling in love with his computer BUT if do everything else perfect with the lights and angels, facial expressions you can just hide how bad your movie is, and the audience will be so distracted by how amazing everything looks they won't even notice your movie's bad :)"
"I have always been a fan of Spike Jonze. Though I was a tad disappointed by Where the Wild Things Are, I still regard Being John Malkovich and Adaptation as comedy classics. Where as Charlie Kauffman wrote those two quirky comedies, Her is written by Mr. Jonze, which he won an Academy Award for. It is because of this that I believe Her is his most cohesive film, and also his best.Her takes place in the near future, in L.A., where Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) struggles with a recent break-up. Theodore is quite the sensitive individual. He writes other couple's love letters for a living. But for someone who has a career in being sweet and loving, Theodore's own opinions on love are anything but optimistic; the breakup has made him sad and reclusive. It is then, when Theodore gets an artificially intelligent operating system (an O.S.) that he begins to see romance in a different light once again. Typing this, I realize how cheesy this premise sounds, so I can understand any speculation going into this film. But trust me, it is not how you think. Some scenes are laugh-out-loud funny, and the movie maintains steady humour through most scenes. But the cleverness with how this story is presented is uncanny; it's as though Jonze wants to satirize rom-coms but also make one that is genuinely emotionally affecting. The movie is not just a love story; in fact, I'd say that the love story is a subplot, compared to the larger themes of the movie.Really, Her is about love in the modern age, and how technology can either create personal barriers or engage new experiences. In scenes when Theodore is in public, gradually throughout the film, more and more extras begin to become solitary. Instead of the families and groups we saw before, most of the crowd, by the end, is communicating into their own O.S. This bears a striking resemblance to people today, who are so reliant on mobile devices to communicate. These themes and more are what elevate Her past so many forgettable romance films, and into something that is a much more in-depth study of love and a well crafted character based story.When Theodore gets this O.S., it names itself Samantha. Sam is a very thought provoking character, because of the fact that she is not human. Scarlett Johansson does amazing voice work as Sam, creating a fully dimensional character who has all the depth and personality of a real person. More so, even. Likewise, Phoenix once again surprised me with his heartfelt performance. He is completely sympathetic and believable; he delivers Jonze's lines with the utmost sincerity, while he communicates volumes with only his face. He anchors the film because for much of it he is essentially talking to himself. Jonze's wonderful script creates such a vivid and believable relationship between Theodore and Sam, and one that is like any relationship between two people. This couple becomes so involving and I was truly heartbroken at many times throughout the movie. His direction has been mentioned less, but is just as important and well-done. I have always thought Jonze has had a knack for character based comedy, but Her has revealed a much more emotionally resonant side of him. Obviously parts of the film are based off of his own breakup and romantic past, and the passion and longing is so evident in every part of the film. The film's score, production design, cinematography, acting, editing, directing, and especially writing are all wonderful. There is absolutely nothing I would change; I loved it wholeheartedly. Her is an original, hilarious, thoughtful, and sublimely beautiful film."
