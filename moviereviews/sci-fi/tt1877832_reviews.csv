"I must admit, the trailers didn't have me convinced - and after the sour taste 'Jack the Giant Slayer' left in my mouth, I was sceptic. I really dug Matthew Vaughn's approach with 'First Class' (who had a tough task rebooting the franchise after the lacklustre 'Last Stand' and the generic, dull 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine') and I wouldn't have minded him returning at all. But as it turns out, Bryan Singer (yes, I dare speak his name) still has a few tricks up his sleeve. For its sheer scale and epic storytelling alone, 'Days of Future Past' is fantastic.It's a shame there's so much controversy surrounding this film, but I guess whoever chooses to deprive himself willingly of such a pleasure must be fully aware that he does so at his own expense. Because this is the kind of film that made me fall in love with movies in the first place.Yet (despite my 10-star review), it's not perfect. And it's not 'The Usual Suspects' with mutants - how could it be; this is simply not that kind of film. But I have to say that pretty much my only gripe with this movie is that it has too many characters and that some of them don't get enough screen time (or actually, there's not too many characters: there's just too many great actors playing those characters – but then again, that's half of the fun). Of all the X-men films, this has the most complex plot – and also the most interesting. Different time-lines are tricky to do and can be rather hard to follow, but thanks to a (very!) clever script with a great part for Logan, we never get lost. And that's the best news: sorely missed in the last instalment (except for a hilarious cameo), the franchise has Hugh Jackman back. And of him at least we do get to see a lot, since he really leads us through this film (giving his best Wolverine performance yet along the way). If Logan can be called the heart of the X-men, then Charles Xavier must be the mind while Magneto and Mystique provide the - slightly twisted - soul, and seeing them all together again brought a broad, stupid grin to my face (which only got broader whenever Quicksilver appeared on screen - for reasons you will have to find out for yourselves). What really sets the X-men films apart from the ever more derivative comic-book adaptations – at least as far as I'm concerned – is that I always genuinely cared for the characters, and 'Days of Future Past' is no exception. I love loud, spectacular action movies as much as the next guy, but if I don't get to care for the protagonists – what's the point? The reason I gave this 10 stars, and what is so exceptional these days, is that what we get here is a complex, smart Fantasy/Sci-Fi thrill-ride that respects its origins as much as it embraces the future, while never - ever - forgetting that its first job is to entertain the audience. For finding that perfect, rare balance between character-driven human drama and no-holds-barred popcorn action spectacle, 'Days of Future Past' deserves my 10-star rating (which is a first for me: I've never given 10-stars to a comic-book movie).So my verdict: If you like to get your minds blown by something with true heart and soul, this massive 'mutant' of a film is upon you, and all you have to do is give in to the X-citement. Enjoy the ride.Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/"
"With its mind-boggling premise and jaw-dropping cast, X-Men: Days Of Future Past blasts into cinemas bearing the weight of great expectations. Surely this mash-up of X-Men past and future has the potential to be the best superhero blockbuster our world will ever see? Well, yes and no.To be strictly objective, Days Of Future Past can occasionally come off as a little too earnest, its enormous cast of characters getting somewhat lost in the grinding of its narrative gears. But, when it works (which is most of the time), Days Of Future Past comes pretty darn close to nerdvana – this is a smart, rich film that effectively mines its source material (both the movies and Chris Claremont's classic 1981 storyline in the comic books) and its incredible cast for emotion, power and depth.Flash forward to the bleakest of futures. X-Men we have known – led by perennial frenemies Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Erik Lensherr/Magneto (Ian McKellen) – are being hunted mercilessly by a horde of intelligent, death-mongering robots known as Sentinels. With little hope for survival, the desperate X-Men decide to send Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back in time to the 1970s. There, he must find the younger Charles (James McAvoy) and Erik (Michael Fassbender) – several years estranged after the traumatic events of X-Men: First Class – and get them to change the future before it can happen.Sounds simple enough? Not really. Days Of Future Past frequently threatens to fall foul of its complicated puzzle-box of a narrative, one that involves time travel, quantum physics and a swirling mess of characters, action and motivations. There's Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), creator of the Sentinel programme, whose assassination in the past by Charles' pseudo-sister Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) brings about the dystopia of the future. There are prison breaks, astral projections, and several grisly mutant deaths. Truthfully, this incredibly ambitious mix of character, plot and spectacle could very easily go horribly wrong.What's so impressive about director Bryan Singer's return to the franchise is how well he weaves all the disparate threads of his narrative together. This is emphatically not the Singer who gave us mediocre misfires like Superman Returns and Jack The Giant Slayer. Rather, this is the work of the Singer who made his mark with films like X1, X2 and The Usual Suspects, all of which featured a masterful blend of wit and wisdom, character and story.In Days Of Future Past, Singer skilfully plays on the schism that opened up between Erik and Charles at the end of First Class to add welcome depths of emotion to the high stakes already in play. The deep, difficult relationship between the two men has always been the fulcrum of the series, and Singer allows it to breathe and grow. With the help of McAvoy and Fassbender (not to mention Stewart and McKellen), some of the best actors in the business, the director makes it possible to believe that resentment can give way to forgiveness, and vice versa, often in the blink of an eye. McAvoy, in particular, gives a shudderingly good performance as a man called upon to help others when he's lost his own way.With such an enormous revolving cast of characters, Singer even manages to give many – though not all – of them their hearts and souls. (Alas, Storm/Ororo, we will never know ye!) Thrust into the unlikely role of mentor to the broken, heartsore Charles, Wolverine must find a different sort of strength and ingenuity within himself. Jackman plays the role beautifully, anchoring the two timelines with charm and gravitas. Though still something of an awkward fit for her part, Lawrence, too, plays Raven's dilemma very well, as she wavers between Charles' offer of hope and Erik's often bloody single-mindedness.But Days Of Future Past doesn't just mire itself in the toss and tumble of its characters' emotional journeys. Singer throws in a few crackerjack action sequences, opening the film with a heart-stopping massacre that very effectively underscores the dire threat posed by the Sentinels of the future. Crucially, Singer also finds the time and space within the darkest shadows of his story to have a little fun, judiciously tossing quips and sight gags into the mix – particularly in a tour de force prison break sequence, in which the preternaturally speedy Pietro Maximoff (Evan Peters), better known to comic aficionados as Quicksilver, literally runs away with the entire show.Make no mistake about it, this is a behemoth of a film that won't go down well with everybody. Newbies will almost certainly find themselves lost, bewildered, and perhaps even bored. Singer's tale sprawls in so many directions that, if you're not at least marginally invested in the characters, it could prove to be a trying experience.But, for everyone else, ranging from casual fans to enthusiasts and obsessives, Singer and screenwriter Simon Kinberg have crafted something truly remarkable. Steeped in history and lore, both of the cinematic and comic-book variety, Days Of Future Past feels like a dark love letter to the spirit of that original band of mutants and the message of hope, tolerance and humanity that has always accompanied their attempts to find their place on Earth.Most remarkably of all, Days Of Future Past practically radiates a bravery and freshness that you'd never expect from the seventh film in a blockbuster franchise. Instead of playing it safe and sound, Days Of Future Past mashes up past, present and future, sweeping up a lot of what has been taken for granted in the X-Men cinematic universe and, well, chucking it out of the proverbial window. The ending of this film truly opens up an intriguing plethora of narrative possibilities that stretch in any and all directions. On the strength of this outing, that's something to be anticipated, rather than feared."
"2014 has proved to be a successful year so far for Marvel with 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' and the most recent 'X-Men: Days of Future Past'. Bryan Singer returns for the most recent X-Men after being absent for the past four films, and what a return he has made. 'Days of Future Past' is truly an impressive and spectacular instalment in both the 'X- Men' franchise and the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe, combining the casts from both the original trilogy and the prequel allowing the audience to view the 'X-Men' in the past, present and future. The action scenes are intense and spectacularly choreographed with some fantastic heroes and foes fighting both against and alongside each other. As a personal opinion, 'Days of Future Past' is the best film to have graced the Marvel film franchise and one of the greatest superhero films of all-time. A visually stunning and exhilarating flick that combines the best elements of the series to create a fantastic and entertaining film."
"I was so intrigued about this movie. I had a terrible feeling of disappointment because First Class was absolutely fine and riveting. That one was even better than X-Men 2 (the last one directed by Brian Singer before this). So I tried to went to see this with low expectation. And what a wonderful entertainment and surprising thoughtful story I found here. Days Of Future Past is the best X-men movie so far for two main reasons:Fans of the original trilogy and First Class will definitely enjoy this one thanking its nostalgia and its perfect and well balanced mix between the original characters and the new ones (with just a few ones who maybe deserved more credit, but is not at all a problem for the movie). & This movie delivers a surprising top notch entertaining with a potent story and some good twists that help to live up expectations mixed with terrific special effects and cinematography. 3-D is very cool here.The actors are fantastic. Fassbender and McAvoy still delivering amazing performances meanwhile Stewart and Mckellen give their reflections in the same excellent way that in the trilogy. Hugh Jackman finally finds his character as a true important one in comparison with the last movies. Wolverine/Logan finally has a proper treatment in this movie that will help anyone who could be annoyed with his solo adventures to love him again. They are the five main stars of the story with the inclusion of a spectacular and skillful Mystique (impressive Jennifer Lawrence who steals almost every scene of hers) who is undoubtedly the sixth one. The other actors made good performances and make possible the transitions of the story until the amazing finale.It has been so many comparisons with The Avengers. Let me tell you something with all my respect. I found this one truly better. X-Men: Days of Future Past will please the fans and moviegoers and will inject fresh blood and joy to the franchise. This is a terrific time at the movies. Don't miss the opportunity to see it."
"X-Men: Days Of Future Past' serves as a sequel to both 'X-Men: First Class' (which is excellent) and 'X-Men: The Last Stand' (which is pretty bad). Now, I used to be a pretty big X-Men fan a few years ago, but after the disappointments of 'X-Men: The Last Stand' and 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine', I kind of just stopped caring about the franchise, even though the subsequent two movies were actually very good (the aforementioned 'X-Men: First Class' and then 'The Wolverine'). That being said, I was still looking forward to 'Days Of Future Past', what with it being the return of the old 'X-Men' crew, and I was also moderately familiar with the 'Days Of Future Past' comic. I was just expecting it to be good though, but it turns out not only is 'Days Of Future Past' the best X-Men movie yet, it's also one of the best comic-book movies ever made.In 'Days Of Future Past', the X-Men of the future are facing extinction due to the sentinels which threaten to wipe them all out. They send Wolverine back in time to 1973 where he must recruit Professor X, Magneto and Mystique in order to change the course of history so that the X-Men may survive.First things first, this is a time travel movie, and time travel movies normally either go very well or very badly. 'Days Of Future Past' marks an occasion where it goes very well, as the time travel logic in this movie is very well thought out and makes perfect sense, I can't pick any holes in it. This movie even manages to validate 'X-Men: The Last Stand' and 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine', which is something that I thought could never be done. It even feels weird just saying that, because righting the wrongs that those movies made is a huge, monumental task, yet this movie pulls it off perfectly.For a movie that's crowded with so many characters, it's surprising that all of the characters included feel meaningful and aren't shoehorned in. We have Hugh Jackman returning as Wolverine, and there's not much to say about him that hasn't already been said. He is Wolverine, the role is made for him and he absolutely owns it. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are incredible as Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr respectively, their characters have an amazing relationship and the two of them are just phenomenal at pulling it off. We also have the future X-Men cast with the like of Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan and Ellen Page, and while they have a lot less screen time they're still great. I was surprised at how prominent a role Jennifer Lawrence had as Mystique, over the past few months I've had a growing dislike towards Jennifer Lawrence but I can't deny that she is great in this role. Then we have all of the new characters, like Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), Bishop (Omar Sy) and Blink (Bingbing Fan), all of whom are great. But there is one new character who is greater than all, and that character is Quicksilver.Quicksilver in this movie is perfect. In fact, it's worth seeing this movie just for him. He doesn't have a huge amount of screen time and it comes fairly early on in the movie, but he is the best part of this film by far. There is one particular sequence with him in a kitchen, and it is jaw-droppingly beautiful. The visuals in the scene are gorgeous, the music is perfect, and it's both hilarious and stunning. The way that Quicksilver's super speed effect has been done is amazing. Some people thought the costume looked goofy, but I think it works perfectly well considering the time period and the personality of the character. I've been a big fan of Evan Peters for a while, and he is great in the role, he is very entertaining and has a great screen presence. I never thought I'd be saying this, but I doubt Marvel will be able to produce a better Quicksilver in 'Avengers: Age Of Ultron' than the one that's on display here.But you know what I think all this great quality comes down to? Bryan Singer. I'm pretty sure Bryan Singer is just the perfect X-Men director. Even though up until now I thought 'X-Men: First Class' was the best of the X-Men franchise, it didn't really feel like the X-Men in the way that 'X-Men' and 'X2′ did. 'Days Of Future Past' nails that X-Men dynamic while still being an exceptionally good movie. Part of that X-Men dynamic comes from John Ottman's amazing score, as it's so good to finally hear his X-Men theme again.The action scenes are incredible, especially the opening one which uses some of the new mutant powers phenomenally, especially Blink's. The movie is very well paced, I never grew bored and I didn't want it to end.'Days Of Future Past' also surprisingly has a lot of very funny humour in it, but it's not humour that's just forced in for the sake of it, it all feel natural and within the confines of these characters. This film nails the comic book movie aspect; it has a plot which is clearly very serious yet it is still silly enough to remain a comic book film, unlike movies like 'Man Of Steel' and 'The Dark Knight' which go so dark that they just completely ditch the comic book aspect. There are also a few nice references that fans of the comics will get, which is just a small example of the great fan service this movie does for readers of the 'X-Men' comics.'Days Of Future Past' made me remember why I was such a big X-Men fan. It rekindled my love for the characters and story lines, and like I said above, it's one of the best comic book movies ever made."
"Days of Future Past continues the work of X2 as genre-defining. I have to classify it as a work of art/comic book pulp fiction. The characters, effects, and story are outstanding. Everything in this movie is exceedingly better in the sequel then even the first two films and First Class. Like X2, the acting is superb and the dialogue is rich. Every character feels believable. No cartoonish villains, every side of the issue is presented by people who believe they are the ones who are in the right and the underlying message of tolerance and bigotry only add to the depth of this film. What's better then its predecessor X3 in every way. It restores the sense of epic adventure and grand-scale storytelling that's been absent from far too many of most alleged blockbusters.This film is far more sophisticated and has a better story than any X-Men movie to date. Here, the characters previously introduced but under used are utilized in a comprehensive and cohesive manner, and the newly introduced characters are blended in seamlessly with the story. The music is very good as is the special effects. The budget clearly hit the screen fully and there are truly some amazing sequences to behold. The cast-selection is still perfect.Overall, this is one of the best genre films of all-time."
"As a well known director one says, to make a great movie, you have to (as a director) believe your movie is the best ever made. In today's blockbuster standards, we do not see that at all. What I see when I watch a Marvel/Disney movie (just for the example), I feel as a spectator that directors want to make an entertainment movie, with an absolutely needs of huge action and explosion scenes, with a crescendo structure ending with a KABOOM (what an illustration^^). That's great, that make good blockbusters – but not great. I had high expectations with this movie, and yet I am not an X-Men fan and Bryan singer disappointed me a lot of times - but the trailer gave me chills and as French, I really wanted to see Omar Sy in a super-production (stupid but true). Anyway, after seeing it, with 2500 X-Men fan in Paris, I was divided. In fact, I expected something else entirely. There is some plot holes, monotonous parts However, after thought a lot about it, I have to say that is a masterpiece in super heroes' movies. Why? Because it is very different from what we see today, we are not waiting for a finale with explosions, characters just keep moving so the finale do not overdo it but is still very impressive visually. Plus, this movie is very human paradoxically: it speaks about usual mutants themes, but the very point of the movie is can we change, whether it be the past or our vision of the present. The intelligence of the movie is not to focus on changing the past but on writing the present. But the most important thing that makes this movie great is that Bryan Singer loves this franchise and more than making a great blockbuster, he wanted to make a great movie relying on the characters. He was convinced of making the best movie ever and even if it is not the case, I felt it, so despite all is defaults, X-MEN DAYS OF THE FUTURE PAST is a great movie, maybe, one of the best super-hero movies ever made. I advise you to stay till the end of the credits, the scene is just awesome."
"simply said it was well directed and well acted with good pacing,great cgi effects and epic soundtrack. what more can you expect from a superhero movie? X-Men might be my favorite superhero movie (except wolverine spin off), and DOFP might be the best of them. It's an all star movie with a good director (everything not related to professionalism is irrelevant), in paper it's guaranteed to be at least a decent movie,and boy, they didn't disappoint me at all, really surpassed my expectation.I am absorbed, nothing else matter except the scenes in front of me.It already had my attention since the overview of the future narrated by professor X. The story has a good pacing,not to slow but not to fast. I didn't notice any plot holes, and there's nothing in the script that annoyed me. Bryan Singer could handle the dramatic and epic scenes very well. the dramatic scenes makes me teared up a little,the epic scenes put me on the edge of my seat. And he sew the humor seamlessly, it was appropriate and subtle,just what I like.They said that DOFP lack of any definitive villains, but any movie doesn't need definitive villains to be good. X-Men movies is always about fighting the enemy inside every humans and mutants, it's always about self struggle, defeating the darkness inside of you.4/5 (cause nothing's perfect)"
"OMG!!! This movie cannot be simply described in words. If you loved X men first class then this movie is a treat for you. This is a movie even non-x men fans will enjoy. Go see this movie guys. Your mind will be blown. I've already seen this movie and looking forward to see it again. Hugh Jackman does the best wolverine ever. He became the wolverine i wanted to see on screen for ages. The interesting chemistry between James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender is more enjoyable than ever. But jennifer lawrence and Evan Peters at Quicksilver steal the movie. Quicksilver may not look so cool but he is the coolest guy in the whole movie. Believe me, this movie is worth your bucks. Moreover there are a bunch of new x men characters introduced in the movie which make it more enjoyable.Bryan Singer has done complete justice to this movie. And there is one scene just halfway through the movie which is worth watching fifty times. I am thoroughly excited to see the next entry entry in series which is being called Apocalypse.The only shortcoming in the movie is the runtime which feels a little less being only 130 mins. Rest of the movie is a jigsaw which fits together in a wondrous puzzle.So you must go to see this movie. Every element is in a balanced form. Even the soundtrack is fitting. Happy watching !!!!"
"The Parisian premiere was yesterday and therefore, I actually did see the movie and let me tell you this: all the waiting and fuss around this movie is well worth it and well deserved. It is a great movie, easily relatable in many ways.I won't say a word about the acting. When you have established actors such as McAvoy — who repeatedly stole the screen with his heart-clenching performance — and Fassbender, along with their older 'counterparts' — McKellen and Stewart — you are in for a treat when it comes to the acting performance itself. No surprise there.This movie is a great movie in the sense that it finds its source in the very core of humanity's struggles, and shows that Xmen's themes — much like Marvel's latest movies — are still very relevant in the world today. You will see that yourself.The movie is action packed. There is no irrelevant scenes — I tend to judge movies by the ratio of irrelevant scenes per minute in it — and there is no break between action scenes and more emotional, storyline scenes. You won't be bored. But along with the action, and the acting, there is also the usual dose of humor found in most Marvel movies, without being out of place and without cutting the pace of the movie in itself. There, Hugh Jackman will provide you with a few laughs, or at least, will bring a smile to your face.The cinematography in itself was excellent. Excellent use of the 3D. Great camera work — at some point, you will be rather amazed by the use of slow mo and 3D.So, why not 10 out of 10 then? Because of the score. If the soundtrack was good, it didn't match what I got used to with the recent Marvel movies. Good score but not as good as I expected it to be. Maybe it was because we were all more focused on the fast-paced action scenes and the storyline in itself rather than whatever was playing behind. I might need to go back and watch it again once it's out for general public to really appreciate the little details that I might have missed in a cinema filled with excited fans.But over all, it was an excellent, entertaining and relevant Xmen movie. A good movie. A great Xmen movie. Full of Easter eggs for more hardcore fans as well. The waiting was worth it."
"Right now, I'm still trying really hard to find out one bad thing from the X-Men movie I've just seen: The characters maybe ? No: every single character is perfectly represented,interpreted (in particularly with a stunning James McAvoy and an impressive Michael Fassbender) and useful to the story. Maybe the plot then ? No: you'll get easily into it, because it is very well written for the screen, meaning you will be transported as Bryan Singer seems to know perfectly how to put in place a very cinematic puzzle. Emotions ? You will get some, as long as you loved the original X-Men characters. The soundtrack ? It is spotless and superbly fitting. Visual Effects ? Always there when we want them to be, and not when it is unnecessary. Action scenes ? You'll be amazed, thrilled and captivated when you will realize that every single scene has a purpose, whether it has some action or simple emotions and character's development.All these qualities put together are forming a very classical but excellent & accomplished movie, completed by a skilled sense of cinematic continuity that we didn't have since Singer left the franchise (at least until X-Men First Class). In other words, you should not be afraid to see this movie, because if you don't want to be disappointed, I can tell : you won't be. But is the future of this X-Men movie truly set ? This is something you'll have to figure out by yourselves, and this until the very end of the credits..."
"After the disappointing and directionless X3: The Last Stand and the  abysmal X-Men Origins: Wolverine, prospects for the continuation of the  franchise had gone from great to grim in just a few short years.  Desperate to breathe life back into the series, 20th Century Fox turned  to director Bryan Singer to help right the ship, and although Singer  didn't return to the director's chair, he oversaw production of X-Men:  First Class, an origin story centered on the friendship between Charles  Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender) in their  early years.  A critical and commercial success, First Class set the stage for an  expanded X-Men universe featuring younger versions of the mutant  superheroes, but many fans still clamored for more adventures featuring  the original cast. With Singer back at the helm, X-Men: Days of Future  Past aims to balance precariously between the two, giving the original  on screen mutants one last chance to shine, while simultaneously  pushing the younger generation forward, and fixing a few glaring  continuity errors along the way.  The film opens with a tremendous action sequence in the near future,  where an army of mutant-hunting robots called Sentinels have driven the  X-Men underground. This sequence of events was set into motion some 50  years earlier, when Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) assassinated Bolivar  Trask, a military scientist and anti-mutant activist whose experimental  Sentinel program would only be accelerated by his untimely demise.  With only a handful of their kind remaining, and their numbers  dwindling seemingly by the second, the elder Xavier (Patrick Stewart)  and Magneto (Ian McKellan) discover that Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) has  the ability to transport a person's consciousness into their younger  self. It's a painful experience, one that Xavier is far too fragile to  withstand, but thanks to his innate healing ability, Wolverine (Hugh  Jackman) is the perfect candidate to be sent back to alter the events  that led to the destruction of the mutant race.  Waking up in his 1973 body, Wolverine is tasked with tracking down and  reuniting Xavier and Lensherr to stop the assassination of Trask. Easy  enough, right? Unfortunately, Xavier has become a bitter, reclusive  alcoholic, wasting away in his mansion with his only remaining friend,  Hank McCoy (Nicholas Hoult), while Lensherr is incarcerated in the most  secure building in the United States after being implicated in the  death of President Kennedy. After all, as Xavier puts it, ""who else  could curve a bullet?""  Getting Lensherr out of trouble is a seemingly impossible task, but  Wolverine knows a guy. That guy is the young Pietro Maximoff, better  known as Quicksilver (Evan Peters), and his handful of scenes are some  of the most entertaining moments in the film, particularly an escape  sequence that conveys his super-speed abilities by shooting at 3000  frames per second. There have been glimpses of this moment during the  film's trailers, but the scene as a whole is staggeringly beautiful,  and the character's bizarre sense of humor provides a sense of joy and  playfulness that are noticeably absent from the rest of the film.  That's not to say X-Men: Days of Future Past is not enjoyable - on the  contrary, it's a thrilling experience from start to finish, with plenty  of emotional resonance to go along with all the action and special  effects. Jackman's performance is less growling menace and more wise  mediator, adding yet another dimension to an already complex character.  McAvoy and Fassbender still have remarkable chemistry, but the film  truly belongs to Lawrence, whose ability to emote through layers of  body paint and prosthetics makes Mystique more relatable than ever  before.  While it's a shame that most of the original X-Men cast are relegated  to cameos, those minor appearances tend to come during jaw-dropping  action scenes. The futuristic battles between the Sentinels and the  last remaining mutants are a joy to behold, with Iceman (Shawn Ashmore)  finally using his abilities in ways that fans have always wanted to  see, and newcomers like Blink (Fan Bingbing) and Bishop (Omar Sy)  getting an opportunity to kick ass alongside the veterans.  There are also plenty of references to the previous X-Men films, as  Days of Future Past attempts to bridge the gap between the original  trilogy and the reboot. William Stryker (Josh Helman) is a looming  presence throughout the film, with his work evoking images of the  Weapon X program, and the final moments are full of fan service cameos  that effectively close the book on the original characters. For the  most part, it succeeds, and while there are still a few questions  remaining, there's so much to love here that the minor details no  longer feel relevant.  X-Men: Days of Future Past is a return to form for Singer, whose  directorial efforts since the first two films have been rather poorly  received. His emotional connection to the material and his love for the  characters has never been more evident, and the X-Men have never been  more compelling or entertaining. This latest installment proves there's  still plenty of life left in the franchise, and we can't wait to see  what comes next when the mutants return in 2016.  -- Brent Hankins"
"My love for the X-Men was not born due to the comics, or even the cartoons, it was the video games. So, off the bat, let me say while I may know characters faces, and a bit about their background, largely I am quite oblivious to the various universes and stories. So walking in I didn't know much besides fairly recent news stories dealing with Rogue's part being cut, to Kitty seemingly being the one who was supposed to go to the past. Outside of that though, I was a clean slate. Making the movie quite the experience, even if sometimes confusing and surely with details lacking.Characters & StorySometime in the future, the sentinels have almost completed a genocide of not only living mutants, but those who would be the mothers/ fathers, or even grandparents of them. Not only that, mutant allies are killed. But, there remains hope. Said hope is entrusted in Logan/ Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) who, through Kitty Pride (Ellen Page), is sent 50 years back in time to try to make the reconciliation of Charles Xavier (James McAvoy/ Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender/ Ian McKellen) happen far before both are senior citizens.Along this journey though, there is a need to address Mystique's (Jennifer Lawrence) position in all that happens, as she seems integral in either the destruction, or salvation, of mutant kind. All because of her interactions with one man: Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage). The precursor to William Stryker (Josh Helman), who may not hate mutants, but surely is aware that with their rise comes mankind becoming obsolete, or downsized in the grand scheme of things. So, live or die, that is Mystque's decision, and with Logan having a limited time to change the past, catching and changing the mind of a highly illusive woman, with Xavier's help of course, is quite the task.PraiseWith this being a Marvel movie, especially X-Men, the biggest bit of praise first has to go to the special effects team. Between the fights against the sentinels, the transformations of Beast (Nicholas Hoult) and Mystque, as well as watching all mutants involved exhibiting their powers to varying degrees, it left me in awe enough to forget to take down notes at times. Also, as most Marvel movies have, there is a good use of humor, though it unfortunately isn't seen throughout but only in certain sections. Quicksilver (Evan Peters), for example, probably left the biggest impression on me because his interactions with Logan, Magneto and Xavier were hilarious, and definitely a highlight of the film. Peters way of delivering lines almost seemed Deadpool like.But, if you were to focus just on the story, and set aside the special effects and jokes, I'm slightly sad to say that the veterans do a far better job at bringing some sense of emotion to the story than the newcomers. Naturally, the genuine friendship between Sir Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart makes the Magneto/ Professor X saga more than some re-imagined Malcolm X vs. Martin Luther King Jr. Their complicated history is masterfully crafted by McKellan and Stewart to the point they eclipse the other actors for their performances have various degrees of emotion, while everyone else seemingly only exhibit fear or self- loathing.CriticismAnd with that said, being someone who increasingly has watched Marvel films, I have to say I found it odd that the film with the largest amount of misfits, and those that have suffered, didn't lead to stronger performances. Which isn't to say they weren't good, though more so adequate, but perhaps with McKellen and Stewart there, using their veteran experience on how you could get a point, or feeling, across without overdoing it, in comparison it just makes the other actors look just good enough. Take for example the two major relationships in the movie: Young Xavier and Magneto, and Young Xavier and Mystique. Considering all that happens in the past is what is supposed to build toward the future, be it lost chemistry, or perhaps too many special effects to take into consideration, I found it hard to get lost in characters interacting and sensing a serious connection between them. Making it where the film leaped from past to present, it was like dealing with a bright enough light bulb to one which was luminous.Which to me was weird since in First Class there was good chemistry. But in this film there lacks consistency. Like a flickering light bulb you know you just put in, you know what should happen, and that it worked in the past, but don't understand why things aren't working now. And while I must note time constraints make it so long heart to hearts aren't possible in the film, I do feel like this was perhaps one of the few Marvel films, for me, which probably focused more the action and effects than it did characters and the story.Overall: Worth SeeingThough I must admit I felt a bit disappointed that the movie lacked a sense of heart, the drama of impending doom, watching Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart interact, as well as seeing all my favorite mutants, push this toward being a ""Worth Seeing."". For really, what comic book movie is really trying to aim for Oscar nominations? They are purely aimed at entertaining and keeping the franchise's name out there. And while I feel this film may not inspire someone to develop further knowledge of the X-Men universe to spoil the sequel, it is certainly good enough to keep you loyal."
"*Spoilers*I tried not to get myself hyped up too much with this film because when Matthew Vaughn left I was pretty bummed out. I loved First Class and the new feel that X-Men had, I was really looking forward to him carrying that on. Unfortunately, Bryan Singer took over. Even with this lowered expectation, I found myself sitting in the cinema multiple times thinking 'Ok we get it, we understand what is at risk here, please lets get on with it!'. To start with the good points.The opening - visually amazing and the film was off to a great start. Blink was my favourite of this sequence, her powers of portals were used in really creative ways and kept the action flowing well.I didn't think I would like Quicksilver at all but I found all the scenes he was in to be extremely entertaining and gave the film the comic book feeling again. You know, that feeling of just enough realism to make it believable yet enough humour to add the fun comic book side of things? He was that in spades and I found my self disappointed when he didn't join up with the X-Men for the rest of the film.The actors. It was great to such an ensemble on screen and I'd even go as far as saying the young Charles (James McAvoy) stole the show, with the young Magneto (Michael Fassbender) a close second.There were some nice little nods to most of the other X-Men films and it was good to see all the tie-ins. Also the very few humorous parts, one which comes to mind is when Wolverine walks through the metal detector and it doesn't beep. He looks back in confusion, expecting it to go off. These were great but were far to few.Now for the not so good points.Repetition. How many times do we need to hear 'We need to stop Mystique or it's the end of all mutants!?' in some form or another. You see this visually in the past with the older X-Men getting killed off. You don't need to keep telling the audience this as it's what we're seeing! Also, 'Mystique's DNA is the key', 'They can't get Mystique's DNA or else (you guessed it), it's the end of all mutants!'. This got old really quickly and unfortunately I came out of the theatre more frustrated than anything, forgetting the good parts that I liked.Hollywood seems to think scripts don't matter nearly as much anymore, thinking it can be covered up by fabulous special effects. This is not the case at all and I hope writers are allowed to be more creative instead of getting creativity and risk taking shut down by the suits sitting in their offices.Lack of action. We're watching this film for over two hours and the best action sequences you get is at the beginning! The ending sequences would have appealed to me a lot more if I hadn't been so frustrated with the script for over half the film.All and all, this is a must watch film - but I'll only be seeing it the once. Singer, please pass the torch on to someone else and get the fresh feeling back that was First Class."
"Talk about a rise and fall and rebirth of a franchise. If you're around my age than the big superhero franchises that we soaked in were the Raimi's Spider-Man films, Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, and of course the X-Men movies. Overall, I can honestly say that I really love this series. Origins: Wolverine, is certainly a low point and while The Last Stand was no where near the awesomeness and greatness that was Bryan Singer's first 2 films, it's still a fairly entertaining action movie. First Class was (before yesterday) my favorite X-Men movie, and even THE Wolverine was an awesome and gritty and much needed different take on an X-Men story. I literally grew up with this movie franchise, so I guess you can say I was extremely hyped when I sat down in the theater for DOFP.You start off with a Terminator like intro, the first 10 minutes of this movie had some of the strongest and haunting scenes I've ever seen in a comic book movie. Humans AND mutants are on a losing side of a tragic war against the genocidal, Sentinels. A group of X-Men, led by Patrick Stewart's, Prof. X and Ian McKellen's, Magneto. They have a last hope idea of sending someone back to the point in time, where these Sentinel's were created. With his ability to heal and agelessness, Wolverine offers his services to travel back to 1972, to try to reunite the torn friendship between young Magneto and Prof. X, and band together to prevent this horrible war from happening.My god, what a rush this movie was. I don't think I had this sense of wonder watching a comic book movie since The Dark Knight Rises premiered. The eerie opening got me by surprise, but it worked. It perfectly showed us the audience, just how serious and catastrophic this battle with The Sentinels is. So from the start I'm hooked, then we get into this crazy plan hatched up that sends Wolverine to the 70's and get a bit more lighter, but then we see James McAvoy in a terrific performance as young and troubled Charles Xavier, Jennifer Lawrence being as hot and more bad ass than ever as Mystique, and of course Michael Fassbender as the multi-layered Magneto. Everyone's performance in this movie was utilized so good. Oscar winner Halle Berry has minimal dialog, but her presence was felt, Ellen Page, Peter Dinklage, and Evan Peters all aren't front and center a lot, but they give it their all every minute they're on screen, which makes the dramatic tension so powerful especially when you see certain characters die or get injured. Hugh Jackman was great as Wolverine as usual, but in a different way, as opposed to past films. Here, Wolverine is a much more centered guy, who really wants to help everyone. He even agrees to think happy thoughts to keep his mind from bursting by traveling through space-time. You would think a movie THIS packed with story, characters, and action, that'd the movie would get lost and tumble over it's own weight and I can't tell you happy I am that it doesn't. You're never once lost as to what's going on, what needs to be done, and how everything got to where it is. The story is played out rather well. Each character and actor has the perfect amount of screen time for what it is their character's are needed for. Quicksilver is a perfect example, he stole every scene he was in, and while he's here and gone pretty swiftly, it gives other more important characters their time to shine. You gotta give it up to the writers and the absolutely terrific direction of Mr. Bryan Singer. Just hearing the X-Men theme song playing during the begging made my eyes tear, this movie really brought the X-Men back to greatness. The special effects were spot on, my favorite scene even outshining the big stadium scene was, Quicksilver's kitchen run. The combination of music, humor, effects, and practical effects worked to summer blockbuster perfection. The design on the Sentinel's were OK, I wasn't blown away by them as they reminded me a lot of the giant robot guard from the first Thor movie. The setting of 1970's Washington makes for some pretty nice looking sets and sequences and the future scenes were awesome. The action is filmed so well and the powers of the mutants make the action just the kind of jaw dropping eye candy I've been wanting. This is one of the best movie I've seen all year, it may have even beaten out Captain America: The Winter Soldier as my favorite comic book movie of the year. The action, acting, and story are exceeded my expectations. I really believe the hype and I see why people are rushing back for another viewing, this is a fantastic movie and I give it my highest recommendation. This movie was a Cineadventure."
"I think that pretty much sums up the execs attitude when making this film. Great cast, excellent performances, spot on effects. Too bad the script was dog food. Lets start with the end of Xmen Last stand. Professor Xavier is killed right? Well the post credit scene suggests his consciousness survived. Although, we hear his voice, we don't actually see him (Patrick Stewart) cause it would be a whole new body, yes? Next comes Xmen Origins: Wolverine and First Class, nothing that ties this together. While X3 does close the book, it seems, on Scott and Jean, the fate of Charles Xavier is an unresolved issue. Third film comes in, the Wolverine, and again nothing...except, wait. The return of Magneto and Professor X. Wolverine is as stunned by this as we're supposed to be. But it eludes to the upcoming DoFP. So we open in a dystopian future where, ta da, there's Charles. No explanation or anything. 8 years and 4 films, and they fail to resolve this issue. By the way, that Wolverine end scene was as if that never happened, because DoFP takes place 8-10 years later.I also found it a contrived plot device that time moves in sync, essentially time passes minute by minute in the past for wolverine as it does in the future. Ergo, Logan ages six hours in 1972, he ages six hours in the future (guesstimated at 2022). I would conservatively put Logan's sojourn into the past to be roughly a week. So for one week solid kitty pride is kneeling over him doing the time-phase thing the ENTIRE TIME. I guess she doesn't need to eat, sleep, or poop. Lets also not forget there are a dozen mutants just hanging out all this time. In a world of super sentinels, you'd think they would want to stay mobile, keep moving. I'd like to know, wtf happened to the world to have a future like that, cause I must of blinked and missed it. X3 and the wolverine left the world in a good place for humans and mutants. Then ker-pow, now we use robots from the 70s? Funny, sentinels were never mentioned in the original films, save for a make believe scenario in the danger room in X3. Yet here they are. In fact, in the year 2000, it seemed the world was just waking up to the idea of mutants. Ohhh that's right, apparently as of now NONE OF THOSE FILMS EVER HAPPENED. I guess wolverine never gets his adamantium then. Ohhh wait, how did he have adamantium claws in the future when he lost them in the Wolverine?Xavier suddenly being alive is never explained. The serum he uses to walk again is horribly contrived. It's supposed to explain why we see him walking around in the flashback sequence in X3, as well as the cameo in Origins, but fails. He can walk at the expense of losing his powers. Well, he used them in X3 and Origins. And even so, if the serum later got ""perfected"", why wouldn't he use it all the time then? Furthermore, if the serum repaired his back, it did nothing for what happened to him at the end of this film where the steel beam crushes his legs. While seeing certain characters fully realized (iceman using his ice- slide), the film lost its soul. What made the original films so great where how the characters connected with the audience, the social/moral implications of being ""different"", and the whole judgement, acceptance, and belonging that was such a heavy element to these films has been watered down into movie action schlock. If this film had any real emotional weight, it would of been all those characters in First Class being killed off by the government and the horrible experiments they performed on them. But since this happened off camera and just given a mere mention in this film, the audience is significantly less impacted. ""awww, why they have to go and kill off Banshee?"" vs, ""OMG, you mother ******s, how could you? Avenge him!!!""Although the original films were always set in ""the near future"" there were never any elements that made it seem too futuristic. Like the 3d map in the first film, nothing like that existed but it was easy to see us progressing there. In other words, the world felt very real, grounded, believable. Now, it's 8-10 years after X3, and we got giant lasers, space ships, a re-imagined NYC skyline, etc. Like aliens in an Indiana Jones film, these things felt out of place. Then, we use Sentimels, which is far beyond our current technology and have them first invented in 1972? So before we even have the same technology that brought us Atari and cassette players, we have advance cybernetic hunter/killer robots? I get how putting metal in them while they were being shipped allowed Magneto to use his mutant power on them, but doesn't explain how he was able to reprogram them. He talks and they obey him, makes no sense....ahhhhh shut up and eat your popcorn. Ohhh, one last thing: Dear studio execs, please consider your largest demographic when choosing which characters bare butt to show off."
"I won't disparage anyone for what they find enjoyable. Everyone is entitled to their opinions. That being said, here is mine...The hallmark of an intellectually insulting film is when, early in the movie, each of the main characters stands around in a single room reciting one-liners that give away the entire plot. That happens about five minutes into Days of Future Past and serves as a staggering reminder that this ultimately is a movie for kids.Along the same vein, it would take the film watching experience of a child to not recognize that DOFP is basically an unoriginal mash-up of better films that came before it (the most obvious ripoffs being Back to the Future, Terminator 2, and The Matrix).In fact, DOFP is nothing more than a mutant version of Back to the Future, with fewer memorable lines, mediocre acting (save for the always excellent Michael Fassbender), without the classic soundtrack, and with no real villain.**Spoiler Alert** Plot Synopsis: The Matrix, I mean, DOFP, starts with the all-powerful Sentinels having basically destroyed civilization and terrorizing the mutants who remain in Zion, I mean whatever city they live in. Withing five minutes, we find out that a mutant has the ability to allow others to time travel, but that the farther back in time someone travels, the more difficult it is for Ellen Page to hold it all together. Of course, Wolverine is the only one who is strong enough to make the trip. Why are they time traveling? The Terminator, I mean, Wolverine, has to see to it that Sarah Connor, I mean, Raven/Mystique, doesn't kill The Brother From Another Planet, I mean Joe Morton, I mean the guy who creates Sentinels. What else happens in the movie? Nothing of consequence. A lot of running around, chasing, breaking into stuff, and a melodramatic half love-story involving an apparently alcoholic, depressed, and pathetic Professor X and Mystique.Surely someone out there understands my POV. Again, I respect everyone's opinion, but when I googled DOFP after seeing it and saw a 8.7 rating on IMDb (plus a 91% of RT), my eyes almost fell out of my head.Background/Disclaimer: I did not grow up reading comics. I occasionally watched, and enjoyed, the X-Men cartoon of the '90s. I have seen X-Men (really good), X2 (amazing), The Last Stand (disappointingly awful), and portions of First Class (no opinion)."
"I went into this movie with high expectations so that may be the reason why I wasn't at all impressed with this film. The action was bland, short and just seemed like everything we've already seen before. The truly only great part of this movie was the scene with quicksilver and that was a really short piece of the movie. Once that scene was over the rest of the movie became this huge bore. I go to a movie like this with the usual expectation of seeing something ""new"".. well I was let down.The majority of the movie was completely boring. There were only a few scenes of very mediocre action and it just seemed like they did not put a lot of effort into this movie."
"I always thought the X-Men were the real deal. When everyone was praising the brilliance of The Avengers I was more preoccupied in the compelling dynamic between the 2 leads, Xavier and Magneto in X-men First Class. Despite loving ""Earths Mightiest Heroes"" the story hasn't got a lot of grit to it and is rather zany. X-Men on the other hand I find to be a lot more compelling especially through it's sub-text of societies prejudice on minorities these are highlighted specifically well in First Class and X2. By taking the principal characters from both these films and bringing them together into a desperate attempt to warn the past of the atrocities of the future in Days of Future Past is a work of genius. Days of Future Past is loaded full of exceptional performances James McAvoy is superb as a young Professor who has lost his way and has withdrawn from offering guidance. Michael Fassbender's performance is magnetic quite literally...but figuratively it is a fascinating portrayal of a man determined to get his way yet still showing respect for his old friend Charles Xavier. This dynamic that has carried on from First Class really fascinates me. Yes the action scenes with the mutant side characters like Blink and Storm are very impressive but the conflicting principals of these 2 characters is the big draw to me.Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian's interpretation of these characters is a much welcome return adding an element of class to the rowdiness of there youthful selves. However I wanted to see more of the desperate survival within the post apocalyptic future. A whole movie could've been done on establishing the bleak future of a world ruled by Sentinels. The big poster characters of these movies Wolverine and Mystique are also great. Wolverine is a bit of a bore in his solo outings. Having him function within a team is infinitely more compelling. Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique has many poignant scenes with the story hinging on her actions entirely which really raise the stakes. With such an expansive cast all having a chance to shine it is a massive shame that Bryan Singer didn't direct the major let down that was X-Men 3 and Origins. It's nice that the characters act like the events never happened but it's a shame that I can't. As a standalone entry to the series X-Men Days of Future Past has a thoughtful script that doesn't rely on mindless action sequences to keep your attention. Along with it's stellar cast, this is a truly amazing installment to a messy franchise that now has a chance to develop."
Easily the best X Men film yet with a storyline that requires you to think whilst marvelling at the amazing special effects and action scenes taking place before your eyes. James McAvoy puts in a superb performance as an embittered Professor X and there are great performances from Hugh Jackman and Michael Fassbender in their respective roles as Wolverine and Magneto but the person everyone is going to be talking about is a new mutant to the series called Quicksilver played superbly with the right amount of arrogance and likability by Evan Peters. His huge action scene where he is required to rescue an imprisoned Magneto from a heavily guarded Pentagon is an absolute delight and already a contender of most amazing action scene of the year and I cant see anything beating it. Trust me - you will want to watch this scene again and again as there is so much to marvel at. Pity that Quicksilver is absent after this as the film does sorely miss the character. Hoping to see more of him in the future. The film does have a great climax though featuring a highly inventive use of a football stadium and a post credits scene with a hint of what to expect in the next movie. All in all a great movie that is going to delight and entertain young and old alike.
"This is what the comic book film genre was supposed to be. Fast-paced, intense, character-driven - all of that, but with HEART. What a work of art, Marvel. Please don't take us for granted like you did in the early 2000's. Keep it true. Keep it fun. That's all you have to do. And you did it here. THANK YOU. And how can you not love the easter eggs everywhere in these films. Wonderful hat-tips to the comics.But that cast....this series set the bar wonderfully high for subsequent Marvel movies. Michael Fassbender & James McAvoy might be the greatest actors in a Marvel film. Good GOD. Perfect ambassadors for the X-Men series for years to come. And uh......can we see Deadpool done right? :) Beggars & choosers, I know! PEACE!"
"I don't want to give much away, but of all of the X-Men ever made, this is one of my favorites!The additional cast was concerning, but overall actually added to this film.Of course the rest of the usual cast were on point as usual, but what made this movie different than the others, was not the battle of good vs evil, but the timeline differences and the new cast's involvement.A great addition to the X-Men franchise, and a 9/10 from me!"
"Ahhh the X-men Franchise.There's the good: X-men, X2 and x-men first class and the bad: X3, god dammit Brett Ratner.But with a familiar face returning to the franchise Its easy to say the franchise is being brought to life and exceeding new levels with Days of future past.So as always I will rank this art film as 1.Acting, 2.Plot, 3.Sfx and 4.Flaws, 5:Direction.1:The acting:The acting was superb.Hugh Jackman is as good as always playing the 6 foot 3 Canadian with anger issues.Micheal Fassbender and especially James McAvoy gave praising performances as the younger counterparts of Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellen.Micheal Fassbender shows how cold and calculating Magneto is making him the bad-ass super villain.James McAvoy gave a shuddering performance as a broken down Charles Xavier who's lost his way.Evan Peters was great as the speedy quicksilver(I doubt avengers 2 quicksilver will beat this one)who stole the show for the part he was given.Jennifer Lawrence was also good as the troubled Mystique.10/10 2.The Plot:In 2023, the mutants face the biggest threat yet:the sentinels, which are mutant killing robots made by Bolivar Trask, 50 years ago.The sentinels are so advanced that they adapt to any mutant power.So what do they have to do to stop the massacre?They have to send the Wolverine back to the past to change the future.Sounds good right?10/10 3.SFX:The GCI was simply stunning.The sentinels (both future and past)looked amazing.The mutant powers were awe strucking(especially quicksilver's superhuman speed).10/10 4.Flaws:Although the X-men franchise is pretty flawed some things were explained.Like how Charles could walk.How Hank Mcoy was still human in X2.But some questions remain unanswered.Like did Logan ever undergo the weapon X procedure?How is professor X still alive?Well we still have X-men:Apocalypse coming up so they might be awnsered.9/10 5.The direction:After 3 blockbuster movies, it really shows how Bryan Singer knows how this team of outcasts functions(Not you, Brett Ratner).He really knows how this team works and there's heart in this film (unlike the Avengers).There's a right amount of action, dialog and emotion to this film.Worth buying.Overall:10/10.This flick is a perfect blend of everything.Even if your-re not a fan of superhero movies this one is still going to surpass your expectations.Its worth it.Cant wait for Apocalypse, Bryan Singer."
"In the near future, mutants and ordinary humans alike are under attack and losing the battle. So our heroes from former installments try to prevent this war by sending Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back to the past so he can fix the mess a certain blue lady (Jennifer Lawrence) is creating. In the year 1973, Wolverine meets young and depressed Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender) again. Will he succeed in uniting the two mutant geniuses and change everything?That said, ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" is a thrilling experience. The chemistry between James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender is amazing, as are their performances. Again. Nicholas Hoult does a fantastic job as Hank. Hugh Jackman is Wolverine, meaning he IS THE Wolverine. ""Game of Thrones"" star Peter Dinklage does a great job as Dr. Trask. And yes, I love Jennifer Lawrence as Raven. Plus, we see Ellen Page and Omar Sy, and Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are great as ever. I like the performances and the acting in general. There are quite some emotional scenes. Needless to say that James McAvoy pulls them off so well it almost hurts.""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" promises fun as well. Action sequences are spiced with nice effects and flavored with some humor. Evan Peters who plays Quicksilver is amazing in his role and gives you something to watch in amazing 3D.Last but not least, the cinematography is fantastic. Yes, I have seen even better results, but scenes, cuts, and effects fit the movie. 3D looks and feels great.Overall, I rate it as one of the best X-Men movies so far. Although I am aware of some logical gaps (considering the original X-Men movie time line), I accept ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" as a more or less alternate canon time line. By doing so, it is easy to enjoy these two hours full of mutants, their powers, and their fears."
"For those who would have watched all previous x-men movies, this movie will make it all go waste(except x-men first class). Actually the whole movie is based on humans capturing mystique in 1973, some years after the time in x-men first class, and using her DNA to make powerful sentinels to eliminate mutant race. Now here maybe some questions that you might think after watching the movie: 1. If Mystique was captured in 1973, how did she make an appearance in x-men 1,2,3? 2. How can Magneto control the sentinels(robots) and really large objects (A Football stadium) in 1973? 3. If the future is changed, then wolverine would never get his adamantium claws as Mystique takes her in the end of movie. So was there any sense watching x-men origins wolverine? 4. Finally, if no-one dies, than is there any sense of watching x-men 1,2,3 where many characters(Silver Fox, Scott, Jean, Stryker, etc) gets killed? Answer to all these questions is: The directors think the public is stupid and they will earn no matter what crappy story based x-men story they make."
"I went with medium expectations, and this film blew me away!!! the action scenes were thrilling and exciting, the spectacle epic and exhilarating and the acting top notch!!! The complex plot of the film worked, because X-Men fans will geek out. This film is an absolute blast, a popcorn blockbuster for the ages. It is explosive, emotional , awesome. Although it can get a little slow at times, and the film isn't as dark as it's said to be. The stakes are very high and the film is quite suspenseful and shocking at times. But in the end this film is an epic 3D special effects extravaganza with brains and emotion seriously this film is mind blowing."
Days of future Past in my opinion reigns as one of the greatest movies of all time.I said this immediately after seeing the film I say this now years later 8.0 and climbing.This is an epic adventure you will be on the edge of your seat it's storytelling at its best a complete sinematic master piece.Just go see it.
"By brilliantly combining the original cast and our new first class crew, all while telling a classic comic book storyline and giving it JUSTICE. ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" gives us everything we love about this franchise and more, with great performances all around and giving us a magnificent hybrid conclusion/beginning that sets the stage for what's yet to come."
"The X-Men send wolverine to the past in a desperate effort to change history and prevent an event that results in doom for both humans and mutants. To me it's a very welcome return to Bryan Singer as X-Men I and II were very good! He really captured the essence of the X-Men comic books which was as it's heart the mutant and humans struggle, politics and emotions of that. Bryan Singer returned this time, taking what Matthew Vaughn brought us with X-Men: First Class and linked the two world together in a perfectly satisfying and epic new film. This exciting summer blockbuster will satisfy fans of the series. Singer is clearly comfortable in this world once again bringing humour to it as well as incredible action. It's in fact great to see the X-Men fight together in a unique and interesting way. Plus, he exceeded people expectations (unfortunately for him though, particularly in this world where expectations are always higher), pleased, surprised and shocked them as well with X-Men I at a time when there were no genre. X-Men II, I think, for many people is a favourite of the entire series. He managed to elevate that again with Days of Future Past. This film is not only an X-Men movie but it's also a time travel movie. Which can go both way. It gives the writers and director the chance to do something that we're not expecting as they could literally pull anything out of the bag. This film might be the best X-Men movie we've ever had as Singer fixed all the mistakes made since his departure with X-Men III and Origins. It's great! However, people tend to smash those big blockbusters because of all the special effects and kids related things but this movie has on display incredible acting talent, the cast is absolutely incredible, such as Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen. Plus, the big stands out are Michael Fassbender and especially James McAvoy who is amazing as Professor X in far more difficult times. They have such a fantastic chemistry, we can feel the endless amount of back stories in place within those characters. Yes, there are many characters in this film which is pretty easy to mess up with. We've seen that recently, for instance in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 which handled his characters terribly. But here, every single one of these characters having really awesome bad ass fight scenes and cool comic book moments, have emotional arcs as well. Undeniably the emotional core of the movie is intact from the beginning. One of the best sequences involved Evan Peters as Quicksilver, trust me as I say that he steels every moments he's on the screen. Every scenes he's in it, not a whole bunch, but still every scene is PERFECT. When he's demonstrating his powers, is actually one of the best scene I have ever seen in a comic book film in my (short) entire life. Finally, only a couple of minor issue including on the one hand little to much silly humour, but I have to admit that it's part of the series. Sometimes humour was extremely clever throughout the movie, characters did jokes and it works. On the other hand there were to little time spent on worthy character such as Dr. Bolivar Trask. Indeed, Peter Dinklage is an amazing actor but he didn't really strike the fear and intensity that I was hoping from him, as we didn't really know what are his motivations to exterminate mutants by creating the Sentinel. The character of Bishop also disappointed me as he doesn't look like the comics in any way. X-Men: Days of Future Past represents a great conclusion as well as a fresh beginning for the next films to come. Overall, even if you're not an X-Men fan despite just the fantasy and spectacle, the story is so deeply human and moving that I feel like everyone has to relate to this franchise. As you could tell by now I'm a huge fan of Marvel universe. I loved X-Men DOFP and of course I'm really looking forward to Apocalypse, more than ever before!"
"The timeline of the X-Men movie franchise has been troubling ever since the supposedly conclusion of the series, X-Men: The Last Stand. The studio continues to make more of these by telling each of the mutants' origin stories, but it wasn't quite a success due to leading to a grope of making two awful Wolverine movies and a main prequel that doesn't know where to go afterwards. A solution to fix this is simply time-travel. With all the space time continuum and stuff, it finally has the chance to amend the universe and unhappen the unwanted events of the last movies. In that way, X-Men: Days of Future Past triumphs. The movie itself does need to be a little economical in its exposition, but as a blockbuster it is quite a solid entertainment.The plot isn't actually a big of an adventure as it sounds. This fact may blind the audience by the vast amount of references from the past films, astounding action scenes, and extended character work. Take all of that away, you'll just get a breezy little mission that just walks in to historic periods and places. Not saying this is a bad thing; the action scenes are in fact a huge benefit of providing real momentum, and the pathos of the main characters are also worth exploring. It's a real joy just seeing these mutants get back together again. But the weakness here is it's too drawn to nostalgia. Don't get me wrong, it is fun remembering the best parts of the old X-Men, and as a time travel movie, this is absolutely essential, but only few become helpful to the plot. The rest of them is just a fan service which doesn't always elevate the overall story.Then again, the real pleasures are the basic appeal of the series. Most X-Men movies are usually more focused on Wolverine than anyone else, and this sequel might do the same. Surprisingly, it was able to juxtapose each of the major character's arc. The young Professor X and Mystique remain the most intriguing among, the script doesn't always give enough detail to it, but their actors bring the gravity they deserve. The action, once again, is pretty well done. Besides of the future scenes, it provides more than just explosions. There is a real direction going on to these sequences and the camera perfectly shows its every action which makes it totally entertaining.X-Men: Days of Future Past stands as perfect as a fan service. What exactly matters in this installment is to erase what was messed up by the last few movies by taking the concept of time-travel, butterfly effect, etc. The whole film is still too burdened by the past which sometimes hinders the plot, it would have been a much compelling movie if it goes deeper within its intriguing subtext. In the end, the film still succeeds in their goal, and it is a simple one which comic book fans will definitely appreciate. Therefore congratulations, this sequel just saved this franchise's future."
"Ordinary people do not matter. In many ways this film apes the way that people who belong to minorities have more rights than everyone else and think they can do whatever the hell they like.In this film the mutants have nearly been wiped out by robot Sentinels built by humans and programmed only to kill people with the mutant X gene. Yet is makes it clear in the dystopian future the movie starts in that these Sentinels also kill ordinary people, which makes no sense whatsoever.Like a lot a time-travel movies, it has daft plot holes and doesn't care about consistency. Towards the film's climax, serial murderer Magneto manages to get the anti-mutant robots to obey him by using his powers to put steel inside them. Okay, that would allow his powers to work on these things, but he wouldn't be able to give them orders, that's just dumb, but he does when it suits the meandering plot.Over long, overly serious and ultimately disappointing. The effects are good, but they're the usual high end computer Paint Box fare that are blatantly not actually there.If you're easily impressed and don't care about logic or any characterization or depth, you may still enjoy this."
"Let me first say I'm not a comic book fan, so I can't approach my review from that direction. But I did like the X Men movies (except for First Class), mostly because I loved the Wolverine. My favorite was The Wolverine, which I considered to be an excellent character study that made mutants feel believable in the real world- something which the X Men films lacked with their funny suits and spaceships. This movie, however, disappointed me greatly. I left the theater in a state of uncertainty and confusion, and with time to think about it, I realized why I didn't like it.First, Wolverine was a plot device and as a result seemed very out of character here. He barely did anything Wolvy would really do in most situations. There was no fight scene, no memorable lines- and assaulting men with a cast iron skillet? Really? His emotions were short changed at the end upon seeing Jean gray alive- but then all the characters emotional reactions seemed to resolve themselves at a rapid rate, so much so that their internal struggles felt unreal and unsympathetic.The beginning of the movie was a traditional X Men opening, which excited me at first. But I couldn't feel anything for some of the mutants fighting for their lives like Blink and Sunspot and Bishop, when I didn't even know who they were personally- character development is not simply a display of power. The movie went south once Trask was introduced as experimenting on mutants. Wasn't that done before? And Stryker's reasons for experimentation were much more compelling. There was material reused from previous X Men films. I couldn't believe the scene with Mystique in Trask's office looking through files with a secretary coming up the stairs. This was along the same lines as the scene in X2 when she finds the files on cerebro- then quickly shape shifts before being discovered. However, the scene in X2 was much more suspenseful. And Magneto lifts a sports stadium and drops in around the White House. Not sure what that was for but a big CGI display. And folks railed against the Golden Gate Bridge destruction in the Last Stand, but at least that was to get to the island on the other side. And the sentinels- they looked liked big Iron Men...There is so much more I could address- like the use of Mystique's blood- that did not make sense. The acting was terrible among the younger cast, but J Lawrence took the cake. Every time she said a line it was painful- I thought the original Mystique was so much better. James McAvoy was OK, but every time Xavier had a conflict, he just as quickly recovered so the story could continue on. The drama oftentimes felt rushed.The director couldn't seem to settle on where to put the camera on the action scenes, which made the stories execution and terrible script seem worse. The best part of the movie was Wolvy,s fight with Beast, and a couple of ideas that could have been so awesome- like the older Magneto reaching out to Charles in the future setting near the end. Once again, the emotions were rushed and improperly shot. It felt as if the entire film was over shot and then sloppily edited. The script was awful and there were no memorable lines.The screenwriter did say the script was intended as a goodbye to the original cast. But what an awful way to say goodbye to all of them- especially Wolvy, who looked like a sissy in this film. The teen film seems to reign in theaters today. The younger you are, the better. It used to be that middle aged stars could carry films for years- think Harrison Ford and Clint Eastwood. But now being in one's forties is just to old, so you have to be recast and written out. The only reason I went to see this movie was Wolvy and the original cast. It's sad to see X Men so mistreated and wiped aside for a younger cast that just can't deliver the emotions or the setting half as good."
"This movie is amazing, finally X men has returned with new exciting stunts, and breath-taking scenes, I am not usually the kind of guy who likes every movie out there, so i could be quite critical of every detail about the movie, this one is a major hit, especially with the iron controller's younger version. i don't like the old one, and the young actor is more convincing and fun to watch , and the focusing on the mutant who transfers herself to anybody else is a nice and necessary touch, i deeply enjoyed this movie and i hope you do too.i have watched every xmen movie and i really like their superpowers, and this movie is intense and holds a true and moving story into it, which is important as well."
I saw the movie and it took me a mouth to figure out what to say about this movie I wanted to see it the moment I saw the promo which came out back in December any way the story is about sentals destroying the future of mankind and wolverine goes back in time to stop an assignation on the creator of the sentals and ending with one of the mutants trying to take over the world and they have to undo the damage done by last stand and all the damage from both is undone and the movie only happened to wolverine and every thing is the same as before for everyone else and magneto never happened and is still in the same prison I like it because it shows the old cast with the new cast from first class
"I want to start off by saying that my brother, Nick predicted this movie after the 2nd X-Men film. He is a true comic book geek and saw this coming. I am sure that he is not the only one. I was more of a bi-polar comic geek. I read Archie and Richie Rich on good days and Tales from the Crypt and Tales from the Darkside on bad days. I read super hero comics sporadically. My brother informed me that Quicksilver (Evan Peter) is Magneto's son. I had no clue. Speaking of Quicksilver, he was my favorite character in this film. When assigned a task, I never had a concern that he would not complete it. Apparently he will make another appearance in the next film. Once again I neglected to stay through the credits and missed some important information. Nick informs me that it has something to do with the apocalypse. I really need to start staying through the credits of not only Marvel films, but also DC Comic films. Anyway, I was really glad to see the original X-men join forces with their younger selves. They even found a way to include Major Bill Stryker (Josh Helman). I was glad to see Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) as the person with the power to make going back to the past possible, but for some reason I was getting flashbacks to the film Inception. Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) has his mind set on creating Cyborgs that would identify mutants and destroy them and it is the X-Men's goal to travel to the past and to keep the present future from happening. I would be remised if I did not mention Mark Camacho (President Nixon). Not only did he do a great interpretation of the president, but the whole recreation of the 70s was done extremely well. There were glimpses of every X-Men film to date incorporated in this film and the writers did an excellent job tying them all together. This is one of those films that you really do not have to advertise. Most people are so engaged with the X-Men, that it would be almost criminal not to see the franchise through. I thoroughly enjoyed the film because (1) it was not too long and (2) there weren't any dull spots. This is definitely a film worth seeing, especially if you want to be ready for the next one."
"""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" is the latest film in 20th Century Fox's enduring franchise based on the Marvel Comics team of superheroes. The plot hinges on the team's main tough guy Wolverine (Hugh Jackman, fresh off last year's solo outing as the character) being sent back in time to stop robots from taking over the world. An assortment of X-Men movie alumni make calculated appearances throughout the era-spanning film.The film begins in a dystopian future, where security robots called Sentinels have gone rogue and laid waste to much of human society and the mutant population alike. As a voice-over from the film's trailer proclaims, ""They started out targeting mutants then they started targeting everybody."" The status of most world governments is unclear but apparently the Sentinels have a global mandate, as what remains of the X-Men have become nomadic renegades. Even longtime mutant-rights rival Magneto (Ian McKellen) is now a de facto member. The ragtag outfit (including Halle Berry as weather-mistress Storm) travels the world, searching for a way to stop the Sentinels while trying to avoid capture or execution. The latest incarnation of the killing machines have the ability to create perfect counter-measures for most attacks, so even the mutants' considerable powers are frequently stymied in combat. Article Photo Wolverine (Hugh Jackman, center) must bridge the chasm between Xavier (James McAvoy, left) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender, right) in order to save the future in ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" A strangely resurrected Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart, whose character was killed in X-Men: The Last Stand) returns as the moral leader of the team. He's strategized a Hail-Mary stunt to hopefully end the genocide and stop the Sentinels once and for all. His idea? Just have Wolverine time-travel 40 years into the past and stop the assassination of a key political figure. The powers of Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) help send Wolverine's mind back into his 1973 body. (Wolverine looks the same as before, thanks to his longevity powers—but his claws aren't yet fused with a steel alloy, so he's only slightly less dangerous to tick off.) But even when abetted by mutant powers, things are never as easy as planned. In the past, younger Xavier (James McAvoy) has abandoned running his boarding school for mutant children. Having retreated into alcohol, he spends most days un-sober and embittered about the creeping social animosity toward mutants. Meanwhile, the younger Magneto (Michael Fassbender) is imprisoned hundreds of feet beneath the Pentagon.The would-be assassin that Wolverine is tasked to stop is Raven, a.k.a. Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), whose shape-shifting allows her to imitate anyone. She's gradually working her way to getting rid of scientist Bolivar Trask (Game of Thrones' Peter Dinklage). Convinced that mutants are an invasive species, Trask's military-hardware company builds the Sentinels as the answer to containing ""the mutant problem."" The grand unveiling of the Sentinels is planned to take place in the midst of Vietnam War peace talks. As such, even President Richard Nixon (Mark Camacho) is brought into the plot.Only Nixon could go to China, and thus only the brawler Wolverine could be sent to play peacemaker between the estranged Xavier and Magneto as the dawn of the Sentinels nears. The plot is punctuated by yet another threat in Major William Stryker (Josh Helman), an army scientist using mutants as guinea pigs.Taking into account the vast ensemble cast, Jackman, McAvoy, Fassbender and Lawrence get the most screen time and director Bryan Singer manages to get substantive mileage out of their respective performances. Audiences will believe in the alternating mutual bitterness and empathy between Charles, Magneto and Raven's highly dysfunctional— and volatile — surrogate family, with Jackman's Logan and Nicholas Hoult's Hank as harried (and hairy) caretakers. The future X-Men have a smaller role to play here compared to their 70s counterparts, but the fight sequences with the Sentinels are top notch. New characters Quicksilver (Evan Peters in a very memorable turn) and Blink (Bingbing Fan), in particular, have some nifty visual tricks.Perhaps inadvertently, the filmmakers (including director Singer and co-writer Simon Kinberg) manage to tap into contemporary concerns about drone-driven surveillance and warfare. Also of note is that the future X-Men team essentially takes on the role of terrorists—from the robots' point of view, anyway. The comics' pop-allegory about social tolerance (or the lack thereof) is somewhat obscured by dizzying fight scenes and laser bursts, but Days of Future Past is still a highly competent action fantasy."
"Putting aside my being a die-hard Marvel fan and summoning my critical perception to the film, I say this with most sincerity, X-Men: Days of Future Past is the best film of X-Men franchise yet, and for that matter one of cinematic history's best of the superhero genre, easily lining itself to other superhero films' gems like The Dark Knight and the Avengers. I would like to begin by saying that Bryan Singer is a miracle worker (making the ""impossible"" filmable), making X-Men DOFP one of his finest. Singer carefully crafted every single scene with such awe and sincerity that the word perfection isn't enough to describe it. May it be a series of CGI effects, unique action extravaganzas, and powerful, moving emotional scenes, Singer never failed to blend the elements of a superhero film with human drama. His powerful direction certainly brought the best in each of the cast and unlocked their hidden potentials. For the storyline, I would like to commend the writers for their excellent writing that never failed to amuse and captivate the audience with powerful storytelling while maintaining logic and perceiving bigger messages to society and human faults. (BTW I'm not a huge comic book reader so I don't have any idea what X-Men DOFP would be about) Anyways, the writers did an excellent job in connecting the dots from the past X- Men films (though it's not necessary to watch them all to fully understand the film). Now for the stellar cast: I think the whole cast (both new and recurring) did their best to fully portray the characters they're embodying. First, kudos both to Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan, who both are the embodiment of X-Men themselves; even though their pretty much in the same place the whole film, their performance proved to be timeless without severing emotional vulnerability and the bond of a strong true friendship. Hugh Jackman's performance in the film could be argued as his best portrayal of Wolverine yet. What can we say? He's Hugh Jackman. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender's characters have evolved so much from the first film, and the two of them displayed performance that made X-Men DOFP superior to other X-Men films. Their portrayals held such pain and confusion from their damaged relationship that made them human despite their superhuman distinctions. Of course there's the ever-astonishing Jennifer Lawrence whose acting prowess is unmatched. Lawrence's Mystique is one of the best portrayal of a troubled character in a superhero film, exploiting mixed feelings with pure acting that made Mystique and Jennifer Lawrence a very crucial piece to the film's success. And for the newcomer Peter Dinklage of Game of Thrones, portrayed a villain with no actual superpowers but made the future as it was in the beginning of the film. His role as Bolivar Trask is an interesting character fighting for survival with judgment clouded by society's erroneous perception. The actors in the supporting roles also did very well. Ellen Page got the spotlight she deserved with her vulnerable yet enduring portrayal of Kitty Pride, who's the bread-and-butter character of the film. Shawn Ashmore has grown so much since his first X-Men film, and that maturity is very much shown in his strong portrayal of Iceman. Halle Berry, while she has a much smaller role in the film, steals the spotlight every second she appeared on screen. The appearance of Bill Stryker (Josh Helman) is of course appreciated as it gives us a brief window to Wolverine's character and proves the quantum theory about time which is an important aspect to the storyline. Smaller roles which are included for filling the shoes of other characters showed so much potential that it's too disappointing they didn't got a chance to develop throughout the film: Colossus (who's supposed to be Kitty Pride's couple, though I don't think that's necessary for now), Sunspot, Bishop, Warpath, Blink (instantly my new favorite character) and Havok from the past. By the way, special mention to Evan Peters and his portrayal of Quicksilver for being too awesome. I think it's very obvious that he would appear not only in future X-Men films but also in other Marvel films (such as Avengers 2) because he's such an iconic character. As expected, the cameo appearances by James Marsden and Famke Janssen as Cyclops and Phoenix set us for the next X-Men film, which I think is great. So that's pretty much my though for X-Men: Days of Future Past (not including the visual effects, sound, costume design etc.). This is a must-see film and it is sure to entrance die-hard Marvel fans and non-fan viewers alike."
"X-Men: Days Of Future PastJust got home from watching the most awaited X- Men movie this year, Days of Future Past. And my reaction? Meh, are you kidding me...It's like the best X-Men movie after X2.Bryan Singer really did well on directing this movie. He is really an X-Men geek! He always know what to give to these starving X-Men fans.The movie is so intense, very emotional, and really puts you to the edge of your seat. Some fans might not like it, cause there's not much of 'explosions' or 'jump-packed-actionsm-scenes', this movie shows more of what these mutant can do with their powers. And don't get me wrong, I actually like how Singer did to this movie. Perhaps he was just avoiding the audience to get confused of the scenes from 'Past', then 'Future' then some 'Flashbacks'.I also liked how they highlighted the abilities of #Quicksilver and #Blink. I am actually looking forward more on Quicksilver's performance on the upcoming ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" since he really did good during this movie.And man, #JamesMcAvoy, the young Charles, stole the movie in terms of acting and drama. His emotions shown in this movie were so intense. #Mystique you are love as ever, Mutant and Proud!!! #Wolverine is still him here, not much for a change (though he has seen the young Stryker) but I wonder what will happen now since #JeanGrey and #Cyclops are back? And may I ask why #AnnaPaquin's #Rogue was so little? And please give more action+screen time to a classic X-Man - Storm next time. #Storm is really an underrated X- Men character.I can't detail all of what had happened in the movie, but yes, obviously, I like the movie a lot! And that's just me, others might hate it. But I am one of those people who actually liked the movie so much. And by the way, if your watching the movie STAY UNTIL THE VERY END. This is a Marvel movie, so expect a post-credit scene or should I call it a stinger. You will see, if I am right the horsemen & perhaps some hints of ""Apocalypse"". Oh well, you should totally watch it. 9/10.#XMenDoFP #XMenApocalypseSooooon #XMenSpoilers"
"Awful in pretty much every sense.Do not waste your money on this pathetic excuse of an X-men film.The very clever and interesting X-men franchise has now sold out and turned into the mindless summer blockbuster in the Transformers style.Over the top everything, far too much exposition for the retards in the audience, boring story, paper-thin villains, I could go on...I found myself checking my watch a few times during this over-long stinking turd.My partner who is an avid X-men film fan ever since X1, turned to me as we were walking out and said ""well, that was crap""...I had to agree."
"As if the third film in the original X-Men trilogy weren't execrable enough, this one takes the only decent X-film -- First Class -- and casually murders the popular cast of characters, which is referred to obliquely in the film's first hour. This is done to motivate Magneto, since of course he's never experienced the death of anyone dear to him before. It's not like he lived through the Holocaust or anything.Never once is anything explained, most notably how a dwarf with absolutely no powers but wooden acting managed to capture and murder them in the first place. And of course, that character must not die, at all costs. Because we really want to save this hideous abomination of a timeline?The story is ludicrous, even for a superhero film, and it's acted and delivered about as poorly as one might expect. It's impossible to invest oneself in, and even the attempt at historical trappings are pathetic. Either they're shoehorned 'hey-it's-the-se-ven-ties!' references (which tend to be anachronistic anyway) or they're half-arsed, and that's being generous.If you liked any of the X-Men films, and especially if you liked First Class, steer far away from this. It doesn't make any sense (Xavier can walk but can't use his powers becaaaause of the same serum that turns Hank McCoy into a blue Beast?) and doesn't respect its audience (Pietro is reimagined as 'Peter' and is about as annoying as you could imagine), but more than that, it doesn't respect the source material in the comics or the previous films.This film does 3D well. That is its only positive. It has the distinction of being the first and only film I have not been able to finish in the theatre, for which I walked out and demanded a refund.If you are a fan of the X-Men, do not see this movie. If you are a fan of the comics, do not see this movie. If you liked the previous films, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU EVER SEE THIS MOVIE.This may sound like hyperbole, but it's not. I have sat through patently terrible films, but they also were films without huge budgets and actors who should know better, not to mention directors who really need to hang it up. If this was the best they could do...it's time to just stop."
"Being a X-Men comic fan, I could not wait for this movie to come out. Days of future past is one of the story arcs which define the X-Men comics and seeing that Bryan Singer came back to direct, I thought that this effort would surely bring back the X-Men franchise in the eyes of the fans....or does it. Seeing that Rogue was cut out of the theatrical release was not a good start. But when I saw that there were plenty of other mutant characters I kept my hopes up for a classic offering.As there was not a single cinema in town that offered the film in 2D in original language, I was forced watched the 3D version. Totally unnecessary and the viewing experience is made worse because the polarised glasses make the ""future"" scenes even harder to see since they are mostly filmed in darkness.My first complaint is that the movie dives straight into action. A fight between the last of the mutants and the sentinels. There is no explanation on why these were the last mutants standing, and who they were. The movie also ignores the otherworldly Marvel characters who would be more than a match for the sentinels. The sentinel powers are also given a twist, plus their design differs from what we know from the comics. Now a great start for me.Most of the film is based in 1973 and, during these parts, we see a total of 6 mutants with 4 or 5 other cameo appearances. There was no logical reason for why Wolverine chose Quicksilver for breaking into the Pentagon. Whereas the first Bryan Singer X-Men movie gave us 4 mutant villains, this movie only contained misguided characters. When compared to the other X-Men movies there are relatively fewer action scenes which really show off the mutant powers. It just felt cheap to me and to be brutally honest I was more impressed by the trailers than the film itself. I genuinely felt conned by Days of future past.The mid-credits scene was also placed after ALL the credits have rolled. That means you have to sit through 5-10 minutes of uninteresting info. I won't give away what it entails (although you can easily do a google) but I would say that it brought me very little excitement as it does not tie in with any of the other Marvel movies.The first X-Men movie in 2000 was a no-nonsense classic. The Wolverine showed promise in bringing back the same gritty action. Unfortunately, Days of future past was a disappointment for me."
"(Spoiler Warning) I'm really scratching my head on this one guys, this movie's been hailed as ""The best x-men movie ever!"" I'm sorry, but I REALLY have to disagree on this one. Before I state all the reasons why I hated this movie, let me start off with two positive comments: Hugh Jackman is still good as Wolverine, and the character of Quicksilver, was pretty cool. Now for the numerous reasons as to why I hated this film. So we start off looking at a destroyed, post apocalyptic, landscape that looks like it was ripped off from the first two Terminator movies. We then get some narration from Charles Xavier. He explains that most of the mutant population has been enslaved or killed by these killer machines known as sentinels. Then we see a small group of mutants who are both hiding, and trying to fight the sentinels. Xavier tells them that the only chance for the mutant race to survive, is to go back in time to try to prevent the assassination of a government scientist, which in turn prevents the deployment of the sentinels. So Wolverine is sent back through time, and must prevent fellow mutant Mystique, from doing the deed. You would think that a plot involving time travel would be intriguing and interesting right? Well not in this movie! There's almost no action, The actors are bland, and you couldn't care less for any of the characters! That's only the tip of the iceberg folks! What really kills it is the fact the the plot has more holes in it than a slice of Swiss cheese! Before I talk about that though, let me back up a bit. When ""X-men first class"" came out, I thought to myself: Okay cool, they're rebooting the x-men franchise and making a whole new series."" Turns out they weren't, the only reason why ""X-Men first class was made, was so that they could create a whole new continuity that they could smash together with the old continuity. The result of this, is a clusterf*cked mess! This film won't leave you feeling good or entertained, it will only leave you with a head full of questions. Such as these: Why is Xavier alive in the future, when we clearly saw him being killed by the phoenix in part 3? Why does Wolverine have bone claws in the past, but metal claws in the future? Why does Xavier claim to have known Mystique since she was a child, when there was no indication of that in the original films? Why does Wolverine claim that in the future he and Hank McCoy (Beast) are friends when there was no previous indication of that? In the climax of the film, the sentinels have already been built. Even though they succeed in their mission, what's there to stop someone else from using them? How does Wolverine survive for so long underwater? Did Mystique perform the adamantium experiments on Wolverine? Why and how are Cyclops and Jean Grey alive again at the end? This movie doesn't even so much as attempt to answer any of the questions that it leaves the viewer with! Frankly, it would be easier to solve a Rubik's cube on LSD than it would be be to figure this movie out! So far, I've never been impressed with ANY of the X-men films. 1 and 2 were lame, 3 was garbage, and this one was even worse! I'm done with this franchise! I don't care what they do with the next film, I've put up with all the incompetence I can take! From now on, it's just the x-men comics and cartoons for me. Sorry 20th century fox, but you guys blew it!"
"I've waited a long time for this one. X-Men: First Class was truly first class in my opinion, from the perspective of a comic-book-turned-movie. I thought there is no way for Days of Future Past to disappoint me, but sadly, I was wrong.Don't get me wrong or think I am to negative - the movie is visually great (especially the ""villains"") and the actors do their job more than well. The story is also very interesting and gripping. However, when I watch a Marvel movie, I expect action, thrills and adventure. I do like drama - but not here and definitely not that much. A bit of drama would be OK, but the levels of melodrama we get from certain characters (I don't want to spoil anything so I'll skip the name, but you'll know it when you see it) are simply not fitting for this kind of movie.After some great starting sequences, my wife and I started wondering why is the movie losing pace and when will the ""real X-Men movie"" start. We rolled our eyes more than once during some scenes, although we are both huge franchise fans.I give it a six because I like X-Men and it's visually great and the story is okay. But that is as high as it gets for me. Despite that, I would recommend watching it because I see some very good reviews here so I hope not all of you find it as disappointing as I did."
"Like the last Wolverine movie, DOFP goes off the rails somewhere in the second act. It's imperceptible at first, but then slowly and inexorably, the movie craters.Why did this movie need to be made? To bring back the original cast, which was uniformly terrible aside from Jackman, Stewart and McKellan? They were doing great with ""First Class""; I would have been happy to forget the terrible original trilogy. If you look up the word ""shoehorn"" in the dictionary, you'll see an X-Men: DOFP poster next to the definition. Thanks for screwing up X-Men twice, Bryan Singer!"
"X-Men: Days Of Future Past is a movie about the slippery paradoxes and mutable mechanics of time travel. Although the storyline was conceived back in the early '80s for a two-issue run of the Uncanny X-Men comic book, it feels like it was dreamed up especially to solve the problem Fox faced after 2011's X-Men: First Class: what to do with a franchise that's been split into two time-lines, with two sprawling casts? The answer, clearly, is to put all of it in a big pot and stir. Coming back to direct is Bryan Singer, who seems to have himself jumped back in time. Whether he's been recharged by his decade away from the series, or by the prospect of eradicating some of the dodgier plot-turns made by Brett Ratner's The Last Stand, this is easily the most on-form and playful he's been since X2.The action scenes in this movie are fantastic. The opening scene alone made me feel like a kid again: pitting young mutants against a teeming mass of unstoppable Sentinel robots. And that's just the beginning. Magneto's prison escape from the Pentagon is well executed and Mystique has some great scenes just on her own.Jumping between the future and the past, the plot teeters on the edge of becoming exhaustingly knotty. Fortunately, the story distracts from any temporal muddles by zeroing in on three of the most charismatic characters in the X-universe: Wolverine, plus the younger iterations of Xavier and Magneto. My issues with the movie are minuscule, at least for me; however, they are obvious. First off, Wolverine doesn't have his metal claws. I don't like his bone claws. And even though I do like the ending a lot (it's one of the best endings ever in comic book movie history), it means they have erased EVERYTHING about the X-Men franchise even the good things. So that means the first two X-Men movies didn't happen, as well as the bad ones. It's now just X-Men First Class and this movie. The best X-Men EVER, this sequel/prequel/reboot trashes the '70s with élan.), What's here is all good (with some minor exceptions). The characters are all good, and the stakes are really high, and the execution is well done. This is the X-Men movie I wanted, and now, I hope that they will make more X-Men movies like this one: strong emphasis on characters, action, stakes, and a good solid story."
"Showcasing the biggest assembly of Marvel's mutants ever, 'Days of Future Past' claws its way on top of the X-Men franchise.Sensing the brink of extinction, Magneto (Ian McKellen) and Professor X (Patrick Stewart) unite together in an attempt to save their species from the Sentinels. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) travels back in time to stop Raven (Jennifer Lawrence), now called Mystique, from killing anti-mutant scientist Dr. Trask (Peter Dinklage). Logan has to convince both the younger Magneto and Charles to stop Mystique before she gets captured and studied, which in turn would give way to the creation of Sentinels.While, there is so much incoherence in how the time travel aspect of the plot is presented, this must still be Bryan Singer's best X-Men film. The greatest strength of this movie lays on how it pays so much more attention to its story and script than the visual spectacle it can surely serve. Surprisingly, the movie vaunts some funny and light moments particularly those with Quicksilver (Evan Peter). Quicksilver has enjoyed highlight in this film as his section is streaked with laugh-rendering wit and humor. Jennifer's role is arguably one of the central if not the most vital in the movie. Hugh Jackman's take remains the same, but somehow feels fresh. Michael Fassbender's Magneto and James McAvoy's Professor X are satisfying than their old counterparts, which, by the way, is not surprising, as the rest of the cast are actually just story pawns.'Days of Future Past' is a bold take to raise the X-Men franchise into another level. It toying with history is ambitious, suspenseful and confusing, but it nonetheless manages to escalate itself to a higher ground. A surging epic and a gripping tale that seems not to loosen its hold on the audiences, 'Days of A Future Past' must be X-Men's biggest installment to date."
"X-Men: Days of Future Past saw Bryan Singer return to the director's chair for the film series that he helped spark, having something of a mixed legacy since he chose not to direct The Last Stand. Following on from the effortlessly entertaining and swaggering First Class was never going to be an easy feat, especially with director Matthew Vaughn deciding not to return. However, a smart decision was made with Days of Future Past to craft a time-leaping plot with the political and social uncertainty of 1970's United States. Singer's familiarity with the character shines through which leads to an inventive and exciting entry to the series.Story: In an apocalyptic future both humans and mutants are hunted by Sentinels, originally created in the 1970's to hunt mutants. Wolverine is forced to go back in time and prevent the assassination of the creator of the Sentinels, Bolivar Trask, in order to stop this future from happening. This story works perfectly in both creating a thrilling journey and in merging the old cast with the new. Sending Wolverine into the past to meet the younger Xavier and Magneto creates its own amusing outcomes, but it also allows for loose ends to be tied up. We find out how many of these characters came to be and how they're links to the X-Men were formed. The film also manages to expertly capture the feeling of unrest after the end of the Vietnam War and of the political paranoia found in many 70's thrillers.Heroes: Hugh Jackman is a great lead once again as Wolverine takes centre stage. By this point he has all of the characters intricacies down perfectly and provides plenty of energy as well as humour. James McAvoy is excellent as a much more vulnerable Xavier who struggles to embrace his power and his arc throughout the film is carried off well, while Patrick Stewart makes a welcomed return as the older Xavier.Villains: Michael Fassbender impresses again as Magneto. Showing that the characters conflict began early is a clever move and Fassbender makes his struggle feel so believable. Ian McKellen is also good fun in his return to the role. Peter Dinklage is superb in an understated performance as Trask. Making the character a dwarf is a nice subtle contrast to the mutants, but outside of that Dinklage gives the dialogue weight and provides a reserved intensity that works fantastically.Support: Jennifer Lawrence's Mystique plays a much larger role in the plot here. She being the one who attempts the assassination and the character's DNA being used to craft the Sentinels. Lawrence is simply okay in the role. Nicholas Hoult does standout as Beast, giving the role are geekiness without overdoing it.Action: The action scenes are as slick and stylish as ever before, with the emphasis on the scope of the sequences rather than the physicality. Arguably the highlight scene is breaking Magneto out of the Pentagon. Featuring super speedster Quicksilver, the editing is fantastic and the sheer inventiveness of the scene is a joy to behold. The climax involving the White House is also very creative.Music: John Ottman's score is very Hans Zimmer like. There's a lot of throbbing synths and bombastic brass that can get distracting. That said, his more restrained pieces are very effective and work well as a backdrop to the drama.Production: The visuals in the film are great and Singer shows that he can still make things look classy. As stated, what impressed me the most was that ability to capture the 1970's so effectively, with the film strongly invoking thrillers such as 'Marathon Man' and 'All the President's Men' for its era of paranoia. Switching these social and political issues over to the mutants was handled with grace. The effects were flawless for the most part, with the Sentinels looking unique as well as intimidating and images like Magneto lifting a football stadium looking spectacular. The story and character writings are a strength, with the film doing a really impressive job in explaining all of the motivations behind the characters decisions. I think Mystique lacks mystery, but her struggle between good and evil is played out well. I think the films main flaws lie in comparison to the earlier films in that I think at times it lacks the fluidity of X2 and the enthusiasm of First Class despite its intelligent story-telling.Conclusion: Days of Future Past is another strong entry in the X-Men series, simultaneously developing its universes past whilst building onto its characters futures. There's a great deal fleshed out here and the story never loses focus, which is all the more impressive when you realise just how much is going on. We're at a point now where we really understand these characters and their personalities, so going into the past is actual a good logical choice. There is almost nothing to fault from a technical, action and acting standpoint, while Singer directs as if he's never been away. The film works on both levels, providing an entertaining action trip and for offering some interesting social commentary from that period."
"An entertaining movie, though it got fairly silly and plot-hole- ridden towards the end.Started very well, with a time travel piece that explained some of the past history of the characters. Also had a fair amount of intrigue, especially due to the changing of history angle.The movie managed to maintain focus and keep the plot tight, until about halfway through. Then, slowly but surely, the cracks began to appear. People behave in random ways, things happen that make no sense, and it all seems that these are just plot devices to prolong the movie.The final confrontation makes very little sense at all, and neither do the effects of it.However, great CGI, obviously, and solid performances all round."
"The X-Men series has been with us now for well over a decade and in that time we have been witness to some truly great examples of the comic book genre (X-Men 2, First Class) and some truly forgettable examples of the genre (X-Men 3, X-Men Origins) and in an instance where things seem to have come full circle with the reappearance of the series original helmer Bryan Singer, this latest X-Men falls somewhere in between the others, despite it being arguably at certain times the most entertaining entry into the series to date.With a convoluted story line that even the slightest thought into will display its many flaws, Days of Future Past for the first 90 or so minutes displays an incredible ability to be fun, frenetic, original and engaging with one of the year's best singular scenes taking place in the Pentagon and a whole lot of creative banter taking place between everyone's favourite mutton chop sporting superhero and the younger more sombre Professor X and his loyal sidekick Beast. Time fly's by as the action takes place in the 70's, full of camcorder action, 70's ditties and enough old school fashion to outrival American Hustle, the jaunt back in time really takes X-Men to places we have not yet been and with a fantastic cast, all feels steadily on song to become the quintessential adventure in the series so far but then low and behold like so many before it, this superhero adventure gets lost in its third act.Days of Future Past seemingly went all out to create a 3rd act not content with one time frame but multiple ones, and it becomes a mess of a million different ideas flying about the screen all at once. There's mutants v humans, sentinels vs mutants (in the future!), President Nixon and Tyrion Lannister verse our hero's and a raft of other subplots and ideas to boot. It's a real shame, but the finale to the film feels like a major step down from what had been building before it and it feels less spectacle and more preaching, which in this genre never seems to completely work. While the ending is a huge anticlimax the acting by the large is fantastic with Fassbender and McAvoy in particular continuing on their fine turns and the direction of Singer is often highly inventive, therefore the film feels frequently fresh.This newest entry into the X-Men cannon has been highly regarded by critics and audiences alike and with a large haul at the Box Office the world over it looks likely that many will be waiting Apocalypse's arrival with baited breathe. There is a lot to like in this journey and there are some inspired ideas that sadly culminate in an unsatisfactory and overblown finale. It's hard to agree with all the praise and love given to this film that in the end is nothing more than an enjoyable romp in the universe that is Marvel, but I guess we should all be thankful, it's like those horrible Wolverine movies never happened.3 and a half floating stadiums out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check into - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"
"My general summary is that this is a 'good' film with lots of action, 'some' great acting and is overall well worth watching.Unfortunately, I can't give this more than a 7 (much as I would like to as I love X-Men) because for me, this was as good/disappointing as the Breaking Bad finale.The good:Obviously the 'real' leads: James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender. Gripping acting from them as per usual. I liked the Sentinels. And Peter Dinklage.That's about it.The bad:I'm not sure there's any point in listing the plot holes and inconsistencies because I'm not very observant so I'm sure people will spot way more than I did and the internet has lots of hilarious pages dedicated to finding the faults. Also, I don't usually care about plot holes but inconsistencies really wind me up because it's so lazy. Decide if you're following the comics or not. If not, make damn sure you follow the events of the previous films. You have to reckon that even if the writers had never heard of X-Men before, 'someone' at some point would have seen the script and gone ""noooo, that can't happen because..."" but no. All the way through this film I was rolling my eyes and groaning and shouting and asking ""HOW??"", ""WHY??"" and the millions of inconsistencies kept taking me out of the film and ruined the experience for me (hence the 7).Jennifer Lawrence. I was never on the bandwagon and I don't hate her either so (that proves?!) this criticism is genuinely an honest opinion: really bad casting. The original Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) moved like a serpent (I mean that in a good way) and had a low sultry voice but Jennifer just looks and sounds like a sulky teenager in most of her scenes. James and Michael are so convincing in part because they nail the accents. Jennifer doesn't even attempt to change her accent or voice. The first time she played Mystique I could overlook it because she was just playing 'the kid version' and wasn't the real Mystique in my eyes but now that she's played her twice, I feel like they want us to think of her as much as being the real Mystique as we do of James and Michael being the real Professor and Eric...but that won't happen until Jennifer drastically improves her acting. She needs to work on her voice and body language.The choreography and costumes: sorry to pick on Jennifer, this is probably wardrobe's fault but maybe the actress requested it? She is blatantly wearing a leotard! Like, 'blatantly'!!! If you're going to play such a proud and distinguished character, you should do it properly and just have the body paint. Isn't she supposed to be naked? i.e. refusing to disguise herself in any way? I've never read the comics but Jennifer's Mystique looks so fake and again, it's distracting. Instead of going for a big name, why not go for an actress who's willing to play the part right?Regarding the choreography throughout the film: There were loads of fight scenes that felt rushed or unfinished or poorly edited...not sure which. Like the sound effects weren't properly added. They weren't always convincing.Why can Kitty Pryde (ridiculous name) send people back in time?? How did the Professor get his body back?? Why is it suddenly acceptable to provide important plot points in DVD commentary? NO, NO, NO! Plot points essential to the development of a story MUST be provided in the film otherwise your film is SH*T!!Tangent: Someone online explained the theory i.e. 'not spoiler' that the Professor got his body back by using the paraplegic's who happened to be his identical twin brother (I don't remember them being identical from the news story in the other film but whatever) and that his twin was in a coma because the Professor's psychic abilities overwhelmed his brother's mind in the womb. Two things wrong with that explanation: 1- The Professor states in this film that he only developed his powers at around 9(ish). A foetus would almost certainly not have reached puberty and would therefore not have been exhibiting any mutant abilities. 2- Even if there was some weird 'developing-foetus glitch' and the Professor did in fact manage to exhibit mutant abilities so powerful it knocked his twin into a coma: 2b- Why has his twin been kept on life support for the last 60 years or so since birth?? 2c- Would that even happen in real life?? 2d- Given that his twin also has to have the exact same abilities otherwise the Professor would now be in a non-mutant body without powers, why would his twin be affected if he has the same genetics and same psychic abilities? I suppose it's possible he just wasn't having a developing-foetus glitch that day like his brother. Unfortunate for him.The point is that if you take over a project and disagree with the death of someone, bring them back in a way that makes sense and also: ACTUALLY EXPLAIN IT !!The ending was great on the one hand because of a reason I can't say but disappointing because it reminded me of the happily ever after of Breaking Bad. Also: that's how you could have brought the Professor back. But whatever.If it wasn't for James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, I would have given this a 6. Just FYI.7/10(I have to ask: why couldn't Bobby/Iceman fly them all away on his ice skateboard whilst Logan was off fixing the past? Or at least just Kitty and Logan?)"
"I can understand fans wanting it to stay loyal to the comic book but there u got the luxury of spreading it out over more episodes and the plots will work better with the cliffhangers used in comic books so that you buy the next one.Also these where written years ago and mostly for kids who now watch movies they can relate to like 'Hunger games' and 'Divergent' which I did not like because they make everything either black or white with no real nuances.A lot of characters where week in this film and the constant struggle between Xavier and Magneto became to much of a drag in this movie.The way they explained the time travel principal was close to ridiculous and it all seemed like a sort of doubling up the first x-men movie.Also the fact that it dismisses a lot of the other movies marvel made makes you really wonder if anyone at marvel is actually paying attention to all these franchises.And hey...if they do not care than why should I?I stopped before with other franchises like""twilight"" and""The Hobbit""because they where way to predictable and after watching part 2 of both of these I could have written the final installment myself and x-men D.O.F.P. is not much better.I am hoping for more of the avengers type movies and the second captain America cause I think there more character driven than this sad imitation of other marvel movies who are all better than this.At the end of the third installment of the original X-men movie I feared that at some point it would create an overkill and Ironman 3 confirmed that and now so does this one.So....marvel make less and make it better so it stays interesting for everybody and worthwhile to care for and keep watching everything you marvel us with.Stay Marvelous!"
"X-Men: Days ... is a dazzlingly convoluted popcorn movie extravaganza that brings back memories of the surprising summertime joy of discovering Jaws. Bryan Singer's return to the series results in his best film since The Usual Suspects and one of the best comic book-inspired films this side of The Dark Knight. Using intricate CGI and arresting visuals, time-honored sci-fi plot twists swirling around time travel, and a sense of humor, Singer has crafted a perfect cinematic treat. The acting of the entire cast is perfect. However, Evan Peters in his all too short appearance as Quicksilver, steals the movie. Let's hope he resurfaces in days of future future. Lot's of fun!"
"In the future Sentinels are hunting and killing mutants, in an attempt to save mutantkind Wolverine is sent back to the past to change the future.Movies that take on time travel take a huge risk, it generally makes for a flawed film. After seeing several good reviews about X-men: Days of Future Past I hoped it would be good. Nope.First off the explanation for time traveling is just a cheap mutant ability to keep fans from questioning it. They also use the same excuse to exclude the butterfly effect from occurring.Secondly the current timeline that is supposed fix all connection problems from the original trilogy to X-men: First Class is so horribly flawed I truly don't understand how fans can stick up for this nonsense.The action scenes were mediocre, nothing amazing. The acting, uninteresting. They have great talent like Peter Dinklage and Evan Peters and make them look like they're B-list forgettable actors. Its really sad.This movie is so horribly overrated by fanboys that it currently resides on the IMDb's top 250 list. Its rated higher then classic films like the original Planet of the Apes and Arsenic and Old Lace.This is dumb filmmaking for audiences who want to watch loads of special effects and lame but good looking actors. Wanna watch a new action film with good characters and emotions? Try Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. A film with logic."
"They should stop calling these movies X-men. It should just be called Wolverine. I hate what they have done to x-men. Bishop is in the movie for maybe 5 min and the story is about going back in time. If your the type of person that has no knowledge of the X-men universe and just want to have a good time watching a movie you may have enjoyed it, but you were robbed. You were robbed of what the X-men really are and that is complex characters with richer struggles and woe. They have failed to illustrate all the love triangles and created ones that simply don't exist. I just don't know what to say anymore. I see this movie has a good rating. I don't think i can trust the rating system here any longer."
"So far as I have seen this movie has only received positive reviews and it's not without reason. The movie is worth every penny you spend on it and more. However it is not without flaws due to which I cannot name it the best X-men movie. The plot as you should already know, involves wolverine going into the past to create a better future. The plot is well written and is very entertaining. The transition between past and present is smooth enough and will not in anyway leave you confused. However, there are a few plot holes. DNA sequencing was not discovered until the 80s. Quicksilver's age raises some questions (First Class was only 12 years before so Magneto was probably sleeping around while seeking revenge before the events of First Class).Next up.. the characters. We get to see several new characters in the future with some amazing powers and abilities. However, they feel quite hollow as you know nothing about them and you don't see much of them except in fight scenes. On the other hand, the past encompasses only 4 characters xavier, magneto, beast and mystique. Quicksilver plays a very small role and I wish I could see more of him as his character is pretty awesome. And since they introduced Quicksilver, they could also have introduced his twin sister the Scarlet Witch (would have been so very awesome). However, you get to see very few characters in the past and that's disappointing because the past is where we are most of the time. Finally the fight scenes and this is truly where the movie shines. Especially the fights with the sentinels. Each move is so well thought of, you truly feel that the mutants have mastered their powers and use it without having to think. The combination attacks are just perfect and I loved the fight scenes. Though I am gonna state some negatives here too (and you must truly think by now. Gosh will he ever shut up). I was hoping to see wolverine in action (as obviously he's my favorite character) and now that I think about it, he wasn't involved in a single god damn fight. Nothing. At all (unless you consider him beating up hapless goons a fight). I believe the move could have surpassed awesomeness though if it were based on bit more in the future. I mean not the future future the past future.. (am I making sense??) If wolverine had to go back to like 1990 or something. We could see a lot more familiar mutants maybe see a glimpse of their past as well (like storm, jean, scott etc. etc.) And the technology of sentinels would be more believable.My Final Verdict? Well of course its an X-men movie and there is no reason in hell that you should miss it. Granted its not the best X- men movie but it will definitely keep you rooted to your seat and lets face it... everyone loves watching a super hero movie. (The Fight scenes are truly Brilliant)"
"reading a few reviews from newspapers and the internet i never understood how a superhero movie with a time travel theme can be better than fiction movies like 'star trek'(2009) or 'back to the future'(1985). i went in for a 3d movie and was surprised to watch half the movie without the 3d glasses. 3d technology at its worst can be witnessed in this movie(but the specs say this movie was shot on real 3d cameras (highly debatable). SPOILERS AHEAD: 1. the future is dark (meaning there is no sunlight in the future... that is dumb by all standards) 2. wolverine has gray hair though others tell him he does not age at all. 3. freezing superheated metal makes the metal shatter (dumb iceman) 4. sentinels are the biggest joke I've seen in superhero movie since superman lifting kryptonite island in superman returns. 5. Hugh Jackman starred in the movie to portray a shirtless man who tells Charles to use his mind to speak to future Charles(doesn't do a thing in the whole movie). 6. blink dies the same way twice... as if she matters. 7. magneto was broken from prison to be sent back to prison. 8. Jennifer Lawrence was CGIfied for every scene except the talking ones(completely unnecessary) 9. kitty pryde bled for two days in the future and didn't die (why does Bryan singer make movies any more) 10. old sentinels were hacked by metal bars and obey magneto (again. why does Bryan singer make movies anymore) 11. hank's mutation suppression serum could have been mass produced in the dark times to avoid sentinel attacks.MATHEW VAUGHN needs great respect to have revived the xmen franchise but days of future past was a publicity stunt to just breach the box office barriers garnering all fans of Hugh Jackman, Jennifer Lawrence, Patrick Stewart, Ian mckellen, Michael fassbender, Ellen page, James mcavoy and halle berry.the one star in this review is given to the only star in this movie who matters (EVAN PETERS).... his engaging 7 minute screen time is the only thing that matters in the movie."
"I give this film one star because the best part was by FAR the quicksilver character and his shining scene(s), which was well worth the ticket price to see. And the acting in this film as well as CGI is great.But this is an already over-hyped, over ambitious, bunch of nothingness on the screen for 2 hours that is disappointing when you think about it for more than 5 minutes.What is with the need to have Wolverine's Bare A** in a pg-13 movie basically for kids who like comic books? ? And a funny line from the much better predecessor, First Class, dropped the F-Bomb in a very useful and powerful way, but in this film they use their PG13 F word to reference an already old joke...WE GET IT. It's not funny, if you're going to be edgy, make it an R Rated film. Not sure why in a light-hearted super hero film we need this garbage along with a side plot of our main character basically being hooked to smack and shooting needles into his arm like it's a Pulp Fiction junkie.And does every super hero movie since Dark Knight have to be full of gloomy whining ironically detached emo hipster super heroes?And the remainder of this review is all WHYS for Hollywood writers/executives who thought this script made sense:Why the cliché 70's schtick? Just because the 70's has iconic events and fashion/music, doesn't mean that every waking moment was filled with greatest hits of the 70's references, and not every person was dressed like a bad SNL sketch about the 70's, and not every 70's film has to drive into our heads that JFK, NIXON, and the Vietnman War were all things....and furthermore, the bad technocolor ""70's"" film footage of mutants fighting was laughable and brought NOTHING to the film, and never paid off whatsoever. Not to mention most of the technology made no sense in other spots of the film. Why try to keep true to real historical characters in our history like Nixon or JFK when in movies like X2 there is just some generic president of the USA??? Just referencing history's greatest hits that mouthbreathers MAY HAVE HEARD OF, does not automatically make your film epic or legit.Why the rushed distopian future set up and why if the killer terminator robots were made and operational in the 1970's did we not hear anything about them in the previous X Men films? It's as shoehorned as the ""prophecy"" from the Star Wars prequels. The future world did not feel lived in...it was just set piece and set piece and set piece, filled with some characters who seem more interesting than the boring idiots we were following.Why cram so many characters into the film when you can't fit ALL of them anyways? Cyclops for 2 seconds may as well be no cyclops. Where was Magic Mike as Gambit? May as well.What is the need to have teen wolf in this movie? I mean, beast. But seriously, the makeup makes him look like Teen Wolf and his powers in this over optimistic scenario did not really stack up well. Should have brought back night crawler or...anyone else.WHY Stryker AGAIN? Why Magneto AGAIN? Are these the only villains we can get in EVERY F**king X men film from now on? Every X Men movie now has had the same major villain and Wolverine Origins had stupid young Stryker already, it is getting old. And on a side note, Magneto as a character has conflicting personality traits/motivations that make NO sense. The writers need to decide on what type of mind he has, or reveal he has multiple personalities, which he apparently does.And why does Magneto need an entire baseball stadium to trap a few whitehouse employees? Does he not know that baseball stadiums usually have EXITS? Did he not realize the whitehouse could have had an underground tunnel exit? Did he not realize the president could have been in something NOT made entirely of metal? Did magneto not think the many robots would not suffice? Oh CGI has to look stunning so big set piece shoehorned. And come to think of it, they didn't need magneto at all, they freed this obviously evil idiot just to have him become the villain...AGAIN. WHY the hell have so few scenes with Quicksilver? He was by far the most charismatic and interesting. Would have paid off if he saved the day instead of Professor King Of Ireland Speech. Which at this point is as surprising as an Optimus Prime pep talk. And seriously so many people in this film had NOTHING to do. What was the point of making none of the previous films count? Oh NONE OF THAT HAPPENED! Really? Well, if it were X3 or Origins that is good for the studios and our money that is down the toilet.Time travel is fun but this film's logic is lame.So sick of getting less for more and being told it is substance, it is the SAME NONSENSE but even more watered down.I did like those robots too..so hooray for the mutant killers who I wish were the stars of this idiotic mindless film."
"X-men Days of Future Past redefines the genre of smart superhero movie. The movie delves into the psychological depth of the characters that we have admired for decades. It is not just about a war between humans and mutants in this movie. It is more about correcting one's path and believing that by changing your decisions, one can have a better life to live.All the characters face a dilemma of what they must do and what they should do. While Wolverine has a choice whether he should go in past to fix things, young Charles Xavier has a choice to make between pain or power. Mystique faces a choice between exacting revenge on those who hurt or forgive while Magneto faces a choice between following his path or following Charles's wishes. Bolivar Trask clearly thinks of his own dwarfism as a bad form of mutancy and he wishes the world to be rid of the phenomenon. Smart choice to pick Peter Dinkalge for the role who clearly nails it. His own sentinel program is determined by his desire for ""true peace"" but it sounds hollow in the face of the destruction that the sentinel causes 50 years later.This is definitely a smart movie and not just a popcorn flick. Evan Peters is too good as Magneto's illegitimate son Pietro Maximoff. The direction by Bryan Singer is top notch. Clever shifting of scenes in the final segment between past and the future. The momentum and the pace of both the stories is well maintained.I go for a 10 rating for this Marvel venture. Keep it coming.P.S.- Don't miss out on the Post Credit scene."
"Where do I begin with this movie. I watched this movie twice in two days back in May when it was first released. I had heard some good things about the movie but it far exceeded my expectations.First of all, I'm a huge X-Men fan. I've read the comics for years and most previous X-Men movies have taken a fair stab at trying to bring these Comic-Book superheroes to life on the big screen. Despite what others have said, X-Men 3: The Last Stand wasn't that bad of a movie in my opinion but I was really annoyed that they killed off Cyclops and Jean Grey. 'First Class' (The previous movie to this one) was a breath of fresh air.. A chance to have a new beginning if you will. It was a fantastic movie and I didn't think DoFP would be better. I was wrong. By miles.As you may have heard, Days of Future Past is a time travel movie. I was wondering when they'd bring the future into this series (Being such a big part of the comics) and I'm happy that they finally decided to do so. However, the 'time travel' aspect of the movie is done so damn well that everyone I was watching the movie with (Who don't understand this kind of stuff) understood it all for once. It's a simple story and everything is easy to follow.The movie is set in the near future and mutants are being hunted to near-extinction by powerful machines called ""Sentinels"". The few survivors realised that they can send the mind of a person back in time to influence events so as to change the future. This was initially done short-term to avoid Sentinels, but it was suggested that if someone's mind could be sent back far enough, they could stop the idea of Sentinels from ever having been conceived (The roots of the idea stem from a Scientist in the 70's). However, sending a mind back that far in time tears it apart, but there's one mutant who we know of who seems impervious to anything that you can throw at him - Wolverine. And thus, Wolverine's quest begins to change the past so that everyone can be saved in the future and we can all live in a better world.I have to admit, the movie was tense in a lot of places. There was humour, lots of action, brilliant CGI, amazing character development and a story that kept you hooked from beginning to end. You just weren't sure what would happen and the last third of the movie was amazing to watch. There were some parts that stood out and literally made my jaw drop such as watching Blink do her thing during the first few and last few minutes of the movie (The one that can shoot out these purple portals). I really wish they had put more of her in this movie; Quicksilver busting out Magneto from the Pentagon; Old Professor X talking with the younger one; Magneto lifting the stadium; Actually, I'll stop there..You can understand the story and you can relate to the characters. They all have their own reasons for doing what they do, from Professor Xavier taking the side of Humanity to Magneto thinking that a war is inevitable and that Mutants have to strike first. Then, there's Raven/Mystique who wants to avenge her fallen friends but is she willing to do so at the expense of the future?I can't wait for the Blu-Ray for this movie to be released so I can watch it again in High-Definition. When watching this movie, remember to watch the after-credits scene that sets up the next movie which will be released in 2016. All I'll say is - About damn time that that character made an appearance!10/10"
"The X-Men franchise has set itself apart, among the gluttonous crop of superhero movies in recent years. After seven films, the characters are very familiar to us, and the latest installment is arguably the best yet, with its predecessor as the only other contender for that title. This is vastly better than the two stand-alone Wolverine films.This movie wastes no time, putting us right in the action from the opening credits. The storyline is complex and frankly doesn't make an enormous amount of sense, but with a modest disbelief suspension makes for an entertaining couple of hours. It's also a decent science-fiction film in its own right.The all-star cast does a satisfactory job. (I'm not really convinced by Jennifer Lawrence, sorry.) It's satisfying to have so many characters, which was a hallmark of the comic book series. We could easily be experiencing this story in the pages of a Marvel mag.The film stumbles a bit when it begins to fall into the blockbuster trap of trying to pack in too many spectacular scenes. On the other hand, the musical score is far less obnoxious than we've been hearing in other recent Hollywood movies.I was surprised to learn this was directed by the same person who helmed ""Superman Returns"". I thought that film was a disaster. So he seems to have evolved in his artistic skill.These new X-Men movies demonstrate how to convincingly make prequels, in contrast to some other blockbuster franchises. One wonders why they gave the coveted Star Wars sequel to JJ Abrams when there are clearly better directors in the business."
"From all the X-Men story lines that comic fans could see; they finally pick the one that most fans wanted to see. Directed by X-Men movie founder, Bryan Singer; the movie is based on the 1981 Uncanny X-Men storyline ""Days of Future Past"" by Chris Claremont and John Byrne. Most fans might remember the 1990's animated cartoon series, that feature this Sentinels storyline, but the movie really did improve of the concept. The only problem is that the movie is trying so hard to tie in all the X-Men film series with this storyline idea that left a lot of plot-holes, missing exposition, and huge changes to certain character's look and history. A lot of hardcore fans will probably rant about that from the unexplained Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) coming back from the death from the events of 2006's X-Men: Last Stand or how the Days of Future Past's 1973's doesn't match up with the 1973's settling of 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine. I like to think that movie is trying to erase both the badly made movies events from history. With any time travel movie, there will be a lot of complex paradoxes. So let's just say this film is one of the many multiverse to save time. Since, it's also a comic book movie, you have to suspense your disbelief really hard to enjoy this movie. So, I wouldn't nitpick the movie so much, but I do have to say, the minor differs between the comic version and the movie version are not that big of a deal. I don't mind the artist license, they took, as much as some die-hard fan of the comics, because I really did find it, entertaining. As the film serve as sequel to both 2006's X-Men: The Last Stand and 2011's X-Men: First Class. Much of the continuous story comes from those two movies, but you can see hints of all seven movies in this. This movie marks Hugh Jackman's seventh portrayal of Logan/Wolverine. He will be the only actor to appear in the entire X-Men film series. That's insane, how big Wolverine has become. That's what the fans wanted. No wonder, why he took over Kitty Pryce (Ellen Page) place in the story. Without spoiling too much of it, if you haven't readt the comic. In the dystopian future of 2023, sentient robots known as Sentinels are exterminating both mutants and humans. The only way to stop them is for Kitty Pryce to send Wolverine back into time to 1973 to stop Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from killing their founder, Bolivar Trask, (Peter Dinklage) that lead to the upgrade the Sentinels needed to take down, the mutants. While, the movie makes Wolverine, the all-time hero, the movie gives as least, some more character arch to others such as young Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), young Magneto (Michael Fassbender) and Mystique, giving them the room to grow. Great acting from all three. The cast for this film is really large, and I think for the most part, they gave enough screen-time for most of the minor characters. Still, I would had love to see Rogue (Anna Paquin) in a bigger role. Also, don't be surprise to find out, that some of the 2011's First Class characters introduce in that film, are now dead and few dead characters from the other movies returns. I think the addition of Evan Peters as Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver was fun to watch. I really love his scenes. It's weird that he slated to appear in Disney's 2015: Avengers: Age of Ultron. The legal complexities over the license of the character just odd. Disney Marvel and Fox Studios had resolution to the previous legal issues, which had Quicksilver appear in this film as well as an Avengers sequel, though under certain parameters: no reference to Quicksilver's membership in the Avengers or X-Men can be mention in both films. It gets weirder when the theatrical release of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 in April 2014 had a scene from this movie, making it look like Sony and Fox would team up, do a Spider-Man/ X-Men crossover. Once again, legal issues prevent that of ever happening. Peter Dinklage seem odd choice for Boliver Trask, due to his dwarfism, but I think its gives a way more self-loathing characteristic to Trask that wasn't there, before. Still, a lot of his scenes do feel weird. At less, pulling him in the film the assassination plot, makes more sense than Senator Kelly. Also makes sure, to check out after the credits for a certain cameo from another X-Men villain. I found the movie makes new Deus ex machine as it goes kinda annoying. One thing, I really did find offending is the outrageous story of the JFK assassination controversy. Not only, wasn't it explore in great detail, it felt like a throw away plot, just to have more action scenes of Magneto escaping the jail cell. Don't get me wrong, I love all the action scenes and found the Sentinels to be a great threat. I just wish the Sentinels were little bigger. I do have to say, the CGI for the most part was great, but the CGI for the 1973's Sentinels were pretty bad. Watch the train scene to understand, what I'm talking about. The soundtrack was epic. The movie was pretty dark for a PG-13 film. It was pretty gruesome at times. Lots of dead bodies, and limps being rip apart. This movie might not be for all children. There is a few surprising nude scenes that the ladies would like. Don't worry, men. Mystique is still look pretty naked in this film. Better than her look in First Class. The language is bit harsh. The humor was funny as hell. Lots of inside jokes, and winks to the comic book fans. Lots of symbolism metaphor messages ranging from civil rights to gay rights that people can debate on. Overall: In my opinion, the best X-Men in the film series so far."
"X-men, days of future past takes us into the future, when humans have created robots that they can adapt to mutant powers and destroy them. There for Professor X and Magnito send Wolverine back in time, to worn their young selves and help them prevent the creation of the robots. To be honest, I was a little bit scared by the very bad Wolverine sequel, that I didn't expect the the new x-men would be any good. However, the movie is great. The back and forth in time doesn't confuse the audience, fortunately, and the story doesn't get boring or gets you tired because of the too many action scenes. There are of course some questions that the film leaves unsolved in the end, but I guess we will have to wait for x-men Apocalypse to find out. An other thing that I didn't like, was the scenes that where shoot by a ""vintige"" camera as to show the time of the action, but they where too many, so less of them would have been better. Good performances, well most of them at least and nice costumes, very 70's. So, 7 out of 10, because it is enjoyable and interesting."
I was somewhat unsure of what to expect when I went to watch this newest installment of the X-Men franchise. While the X-Men franchise has produced some remarkable films (like the original X-men) many have left me leaving the theater with a rather large dose of disappointment. After researching X-Men: Days of Future Past I couldn't help but feel a certain amount of optimism.This movie absolutely delivered! Right from the very beginning the viewer is launched into a world of dread and hopelessness. All of mutant kind has been driven to the point of extinction. With their options dwindling the X-Men decide to send on of their members to 1973 in order to try and undo the present.Everything in the film is well done. The visuals are fantastic. The graphics are state of the art. The storyline is brilliant. There was never a point during the movie where I felt I knew what was going to happen next. I was very happy to see Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen reprise their roles as Charles Xavier and Magneto. They have truly brought their characters to life in a very real way.If you are looking for film that has it all then this is a must see. From start to finish you will quite literally be left on the edge of your seat. In my opinion this film sets a very high standard of what a comic book movie should be.
"""The ultimate X-Men ensemble fights a war for the survival of the species across two time periods.""That right there was enough to give me a wet dream! Hyped as the X-Men movie that most fans have been waiting for (especially since X2: X-Men United back in 2003 was such a massive leap forward), as a big fan of the original comic series, it lived up to that hype in a BIG way!What so many other super-hero movies fail to do, is to embrace both intimate melodrama and tongue-in-cheekiness to make a spectacular mix of intensity and fun, balanced with just the right amount of interesting characters. Another challenge that this movie masters well, is finding a character that the viewer will cheer for... it most definitely doesn't fall short. (Except for Sentinals. Sentinals are dicks.) Heck, even Tyrion Lannister, and Katniss Everdeen are in this movie! Generally, the faster I finish my popcorn the more exciting the film is, and I did stuff my face very quickly.'Days Of Future Past' also continues the X-Men tradition of being politically and sociologically conscious and relevant, bearing a number of allegorical references that fit squarely with many issues faced in modern society.(Cue philosophical discussions here). The special effects are mighty, the humor is sharp and in abundance and the dialogue is alive & breathing. Even though the film is sometimes erratic, the paradoxes of time-travel are exhilarating and extremely fun to watch, despite the complexities. All-in-all it's a mind blowing blockbuster that knocks you out!"
"This is the best movie in the series and of the year! Let me start off by saying I'm a huge fan of the x-men. I read the comics, I watched the 90's cartoon, their my favorite comic book title from Marvel and 2nd only to batman. The x-men film series is my personal favorite film series of all-time! I think 20th century fox has done a great job handling the series and I'm happy with every installment. But even though I couldn't wait to see this movie I was a little worried about the time line & continuity in this film, there were already continuity issue starting with ""first class"" but Singer said he wanted to fix those problems. And since this film has wolverine going back to 1973, I was worried about how that fits with ""origins"" and I was also worried about the fact that the sentinels were created in the 70's but no where to be found in the original x-men trilogy. But I'm very happy to say that the story works perfectly and dosen't really contradict the other films! Before I talk about the great actors and special effects I must talk about how great the story is and Singer did ""fix"" the continuity. First off they explained how professor X was able to walk after getting paralyzed in ""first class(FC) because that was one of the major continuity problems in that we saw Xaviar get paralyzed in ""FC"" but in flashbacks of ""origins"" & ""last stand"" which took place in the 80's he was walking but here they explain he can walk thanks to a serum by Hank so that gives a good explanation for that. They did a good job explaining how the sentinels fit into the previous story line, so in 1973 professor X was depressed & magneto was locked in prison so mystique was left on her own and she killed Trask but was briefly captured where scientist took her blood & 50 years later they used her blood to create sentinels that can shape shift to adapt to whoever their fighting. So that perfectly explains why there were no sentinels in the previous x-men films. Mystique killed Trask in '73 so no sentinels were created. And they didn't know that mystique's blood would be used to create unstoppable killer robots 50 years later. So in the background of X1, X2, X3 and the wolverine Trask industry was working on bringing back the sentinels until they had the technology to use mystique's blood for the sentinels. But this movie does make me wonder what happened in the original time line, I mean how did professor X get out of his funk & started the school again and how did magneto and mystique get out of custody but the good thing there's still like a 30 year gap between the events of '73 and the 1st x-men movie so a lot could of happened. So seeing a middle age professor X & Magneto in a flashback in ""last stand"" where they meet a child Jean Grey dosen't seem to be out of place in the continuity. And wolverine traveling back to 1973 dosen't contradict too much with ""origins"". Wolverine has the bone-claws like in origins and I like how they made him wake-up in the 70's, he had another life going on. I like when the women called him Jimmy which was revealed to be his real name in ""origins"" so I liked that connection. The only problem is that William Stryker in this film is a young man in his 20's or maybe early 30's but in ""origins"" he meets wolverine & Victor in Vietnam & he was in his 40's. But other then that it fits pretty well. Stryker probably met Wolverine & Victor in Vietnam and soon after joining him, wolverine left to be alone for 6 years. But since there was no specific year showed in ""origins"" you can be flexible there. My only criticism is that we don't see more of the horrible future but maybe it's for the best 'cause it was pretty dark & sad. But I think they could of explained a little more like how professor X came back alive after ""last stand"". I would've liked to see more of storm, iceman, colossus and Bishop. But at least we got to see them do some cool stuff with their powers. All the actors did a great job & despite playing wolverine for 6 movies Jackman is still awesome, his gruff personality is so appealing and I like that even in the horrible future he's still smoking his cigars. McAvoy & Fassbender are perfect as the younger Xaviar & Magneto. Peter Dinkalege is great as Bolivia Trask. I like how William Stryker works into story. I love the look of the sentinels, the ""future ones"" look really scary and the ""past ones"" looks perfect to the iconic comic book version. The plot is unpredictable and leaves you with doubt about if they can save the future. It's a really well written story with great emotional depth & strong performances from everyone. I love Jennifer Lawerence as mystique. I love the actor playing quicksilver, his look & personality was just like in the comics, he was funny and stoled every scene. I love how they hinted at magneto being his father like in the comics. I love the cameos at the end by Kelsey Grahmer as beast, James Mardeson as cyclops, the hot Anna Paquin as rogue and the sexy Famake Janeson as Jean Grey, as well as a cameo by Bryan Singer himself. Although it's kinda sad to know that the first 3 x-men movies didn't happen but at least wolverine remembers it. I like how the movie ended with many possibilities, no specific direction for the sequel. I love the post credit scene showing the next villain, ""apocalypse"" in ancient Egypt being worshiped as a god. A great film in a classic film series!"
"I liked everything about the movie from the beginning till the end. Although there were some plot holes, but considering how awesome the movie was it could be compromised.Being a fan of X-men I went for the movie on the same day it was released, I had it in my mind that the movie would be lame as The Wolverine. But to my surprise it wasn't and in fact it was just the opposite.Bit of humor here and there made the movie even more awesome. I might go watch it again.So guys, If you really enjoyed watching this movie and if you think your time and money was worth it, then give it 10 stars, lets not have this movie go underrated."
"X Men was one of the first movies about comics during last decade.The cartoon show on TV was amazing, but we need see it at movies. The mix between stories about X Men was marvelous. The contrast color between future and present is other character in this movie.All actors are BIG. Filled with action, but a very good story, and mixing mutant activities with human history. The photography is very good, the music too. The participation of Peter Dinklage is the spice in this movie. You need to see it. And the final scene pots credits is....When the movie comes to end, you want to see more, and more, and more"
"Brian Singer, Director of the first 2 Critical and Fan Praised X-Men Films, return to the Director's chair for ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" brought High Expectations. My Verdict – Singer and Company Delivered!!!The movie does start out a bit slow in the first few minutes, but quickly picks up steam as Hugh Jackman's ""Wolverine"" is sent back to 1973, to try avoid the creations of the Evil Robot ""Sentinels"" which basically appear set to wipe out Mutants and Humans alike in the present day. The X-Men First Class Cast Members – James McVoy (Xavier), Michael Fassbender (Magneto), Jennifer Lawrence (Mystique), and Nicholas Hoult (Beast), reprise their roles for the 1973 setting, 11 years after the story of ""First Class"". The acting from the entire cast is pretty much wonderful, including newcomer Evan Peter's Quicksilver, a subject of on-line worry leading up to the film, is great!!! And special mention should also be given to Mark Camacho, who scenes as President Richard Nixon are well done! The 70's jokes and references are a treat, and the Special Effects are Great!Simply Put – A Lot of Fun – X-Men fans should be very pleased – 3 ½ Stars out of 4!"
"That's what it all really comes down to in the end. Will she shoot him or not? Come on, it's Tyrion! No one could shoot him, not even the stone-cold assassin Raven's turned into. The reason why she WANTS to has something to do with Boliver Trask (Peter Dinklage) building machines called Sentinels from Mystique's DNA that allows them to adapt to any attack and therefore be unbeatable in the future. So Wolverine gets sent back to the 70's to prevent Trask from being assassinated so the future won't turn out so bleak for mutants and mutant supporters alike. In the immortal words of David Tennant's Doctor: it's a big ball of wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey...stuff. Original director of the first two X-movies, Bryan Singer, knows what this franchise is all about. It's not only nice to welcome back the original X-movie theme/DNA strand opening credits/Cerebro door closing bit, but also he who kick-started all this. Oh, what could have been if he had done the third movie. Speaking of, this film (to the gratefulness of many) remedies a good chunk of what transpired in The Last Stand and made so many unhappy. But don't fret, Singer has said he's not erasing the past movies and he believes in ""multiverses"". After a beginning, where a handful of new X-Men characters who we don't give a fig about die, we learn it's a total ""psyche!"" moment and they're all good. This happens again near the end of the movie. It really doesn't have much effect, as all the new mutants are forgettable and the only ones we care about are from the previous films. Stewart and McKellen are what really grounds these future scenes. More of Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde, complete with potty mouth, is welcome after she was underutilized in Last Stand, but she's more just a means to an end here. It's Logan who gets to do all the time travel. His visit to the 70's allows for some nice/funny moments acknowledging the era he's in (lava lamps, water beds, the music!). Things are much more interesting in the past, with McAvoy as young Charles, Fassbender as young Erik and JLaw as young Mystique (sadly, she only really shares one moment with Hank/Beast). These actors are what made First Class so enjoyable/successful, so it's a good thing we spend the bulk of the movie with them. McAvoy brings so many depths to Charles (who has found a serum that allows him to walk, but doing so takes away his abilities). He and Jackman play well off each other, and Charles gets to repay Logan for his telling him to eff off in the last movie. Fassy, meanwhile, plays a much more angrier Magneto here. So much so that he's willing to kill Mystique, the one whom he brought over to his side last movie. What scenes the two of them share are really good, it's just a shame they were opposing each other. No disrespect to Rebecca Romijn, who was a welcome cameo in First Class and did a decent in the previous movies, but Jennifer Lawrence imbues her character with so much more nuance. One can understand her motivations/conflict, and the big moment between her and Trask has suitable weight to it, given what's at stake. Not to mention she's picked up a slew of kick-arse moves that she uses to take down large numbers of enemies all at once. Her fight scenes are some of the stand-outs in the film - they're so imaginative/creative and never boring. Describing her as quite flexible/bendy is an understatement.Jackman, as always, is easily likable in his most recognised role. He's gotten playing Logan down to an art by now. Despite the lack of 'snikt!' (as his past self's bone claws are adamantium-less), he still kicks a fair amount of arse. He shares some good scenes with Xavier, Lehnsherr and Hank. The past cast certainly elevates the movie. New character Peter/Quicksilver is mostly played for some funny visuals, though he does come in handy with his super speed. However, the scene in X2 when Nightcrawler attacks the White House remains the better of the two. Judging by my audience's reaction, this Quicksilver may indeed prove a hit with film goers, though I personally am more looking forward to seeing what Whedon and Aaron Taylor-Johnson do with the character in Avengers 2. I imagine/am hoping he'll have more character depth. Dinklage, who we all love, naturally makes the most of his role and does not feel like some cartoonish villain or anything. The most note-worthy thing, cast-wise, is all the cameos we get of characters long-thought lost. It's an emotional/highly effective moment when we see Famke Janssen's Jean again (no longer the Phoenix), James Marsden's Scott (who's still got that great dynamic with Logan) and Anna Paquin's Rogue. While the first two prove that the events which made so many mad in The Last Stand have been corrected, the last one is a bit of a shame only because of how minuscule her screen time is. Sadly, Paquin's Rogue has always been criminally underused and (especially in Last Stand) done a disservice by the writing, but at least she and Bobby/Iceman (who finally does some ice-ramp forming/surfing in this film) get a happy ending. Actually, it seems almost everyone gets one, more or less (except for the poor X-Jet, which gets destroyed every movie), while the very end promises interesting things to come. While it's a shame Matthew Vaughn, who directed First Class (which I thought rejuvenated the series after it had gone stale), declined directing this one, Singer does a good job of bringing back the positive memories of the first two films. While I do prefer First Class and feel this film had some unnecessary characters/got a bit muddled, the good mostly outweighs the bad. This is an X-Men sequel right up there with X2 on the successful scale and should make most X-fans happy."
"It's not too out there to say that the x-men series is in a rut. First off the 3rd part of the original trilogy was lacking something, but was still okay Then came X-men first class, that was good on in a lot of ways, but was also filled with mistakes. Despite the fact that Fox was looking to make a romantic-comedy-action for teenagers the end result wasn't that bad. But to me it did succeed in – despite the great actors – making me like the new foundation x-men was set on. Then came the worst installment of the x-men saga Wolverine. I think the whole brand reached its lowest point with that film, despite the fact that it's a watchable film, but it was by far the worst of them all. Of course the films make money but Avengers proved that there is a whole lot more money to be made still with comic book films. Of course Fox wanted a piece of the pie too, but I'm sure they knew that you need quality to make lots of money, so they invested a lot and secured Bryan Singer for the director's chair. He was already around to produce and write First Class but this time around he got control of the whole film. Fox then okayed the x-men series most complex story for the film. Thought the script was written by Simon Kinberg, who already fell short with the 3 part back in the day but for some reason Singer trusted him with it. First off the film is good, maybe even the best yet. Of course the biggest question everyone has been asking is will it give the Avengers a run for its money and that's a harder question to answer. Compared to other comic book adaptations and other Marvel films the two are very different, so it's hard to compare them, but I have to point out the quality wise it's up there with Ironman. I don't think that it will be there money wise. They did rewrite the original story from the comic book, but that didn't cause problems. I was mostly worried about how they would sew the 5 x-men films together but that was done perfectly. So the story is okay. As is the script. There are humorous parts, but they aren't over the top. Just enough. The actors are genius, none of them forgot how to act since the previous installments. This was a give though cause the casting was always super. Evan Peters as Quicksilver is so good, that it almost becomes his one man show. I maybe just expected a little more from Peter Dinklage. Let's look at the other characters, as opposed to the other films Wolverine isn't completely in the main focus, and the funny thing is that this isn't a problem. Magneto, Xavier and Mystic step up to the plate, but just to sooth the fans he doesn't fade into the background. But this still brings us to one of the problems, there is not enough time for all the characters; It's one team but two time zones, some characters got larger roles like Mystic, and a few were left to fade away, but Singer manage to fix this problem, way better than with x-men 2 by having huge action scenes in the film. They are done well and are brutal. So we don't really have time to get into which characters are lost in the background. You're just whiplashed by the action, action that is not the least bit pointless. There is always a believable story behind each one. All in all it's a step forward from First Class, and it was a quality step too. It's not just a 5th part. Which is huge. So I give it a 9/10 Max - https://www.youtube.com/user/silverscreenreviews1"
"Up front, I should say I'm not a fan of the Marvel (etc.) genre. I wanted to see a movie with my daughter (15) and we both thought we could truck with this, having both enjoyed X-Men: First Class.An otherwise talented cast ham their way through a wooden script, delivering a few moments of charm but nothing approximating genuine human pathos, and a whole lot of eye-rolling awfulness.Despite the movie's premise having been lifted from elsewhere, the movie plays out exactly as you would expect. This film treats its audience like children, and could have been written by a committee of younger fans. Perhaps I should have expected that.For me, special effects are not enough: I've seen those before. They must serve a dramatic purpose, but here, the money shots only served to cheapen my overall experience. Mutants are not enough. I know enough about the characters already. It's like ""okay, I get it - finish the story!"" It lacks anything for grown-ups, having a dramatic arc comparable to Saturday afternoon TV offerings like Dukes of Hazzard or The A Team (showing my age there). Sorry to be blunt, but if this is the best the genre can offer, I will steer clear in future."
"First of all, this movie violates all that makes science fiction great. It seeks to explain every last detail of the science fiction (how sentinels work, how time travel works, why its necessary etc). The beauty in Asimov and the original TV & written versions of this specific story is that the details were not revealed because it was not necessary to do so!The poorly written and even worse acting of the story aside.... Bryan Singer should be ashamed of himself for so fundamentally altering the story. Trask was not the original target but Dr. X himself. X was not alive in the future. Mystique is also growing up in Germany as the darkest most vile villain not a childhood playmate of X. The story smacks of disgusting from start to finish. Minus one or two cool fight scenes in the future, this movie should be forgotten and destroyed."
"Being an X-Men fan, I was expecting superb action in the movie. Whereas the storyline is decent, the movie seriously lacks noteworthy action. This is an ongoing trend that movie goers in US are giving more weightage to story than action. And that's what probably drives the directors to focus more on script.However, last thing we expect from an X-Men movie is inferior action. Even a single comics of X-Men, a single episode of X-men animation, has more action than this movie. Lack of action means all the fun has been dragged away this time. The only fight I really enjoyed was the slo-mo action sequence with QuickSilver. Now that was IMPRESSIVE!Coming to plot. Q1. Wasn't Quicksilver the son of Magneto? Then what's with the new story? Q2. Why can't Kitty send Wolverine back in time to kill Trask before he creates Sentinel program? Or stop him from even being born?Q3. What's with Magneto's mood. First he tries to kill Mystique. Failing which he tries to kill Nixon! Wouldn't killing Nixon only ascertain the inevitable?Q4. The ending was most questionable. If the past is changed, wouldn't the future be changed in a PARALLEL universe instead of the one from which Wolverine's sent? OR, if there is NO PARALLEL universe, the future should have changed the moment Wolverine's consciousness was sent back. Instead, the future remains unchanged for the same time for which the past is unchanged. So, basically you are applying the concept (timeline) of Parallel Universe WITHOUT ANY PARALLEL universe. Wow!I know that Mindless action is appreciated by none. But please don't forget that it's a superhero movie for god's sake. See Avengers for example. Decent story, lots of comic moments and great action. Yet even with Sentinels in this movie, action is far from explosive.If story is what you want from an X-Men movie, by all means do enjoy this one. But if you want decent action, you are better off watching X2 for the nth time than Days of Future Past."
"With all the excitement of MIB 3, we get a time travel X-men because they killed off too many people and wanted to get Jennifer Lawrence in a blue body suit by expanding Raven's roll, pun intended. It seems the humans have gained the upper hand and the mutants are on the ""brink of extinction"" which would also kill the franchise, something they attempted with this film. They must stop the humans from getting Raven's DNA which allows them to build better mutant killing machines.Only Logan/Wolverine Man (Hugh Jackman) can go back in time, or at least his mind. Appropriately, he wakes up in 1973 a bit groggy with a lava lamp by his side and Roberta Flack eerily singing ""First Time Ever I saw Your Face"" a song more popular in 1972. Logan must get the team back together and convince them of the mission. Much of the film consisted of springing Magneto, which wittily included another era song by Jim Croce. Unfortunately they ran out of royalty checks and couldn't continue with that fun.The action/comedy/drama was a let down from previous films. While the film maintained the special effects, I felt Jennifer Lawrence's acting talents were wasted, although I predict she will take over as the slow motion/ stop action mode blue skinned princess from that Avatar blue thing.The film had potential, but the script fell short. Still worth watching as a fun popcorn film.Parental Guide: 1 necessary F-bomb. No sex. Jackman shows his butt again."
It's a truly stunning story. i almost got tears at the end of the movie.
