Reviews
"Jurassic Park is a 1993 American science fiction adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg. It is the first installment of the Jurassic Park film series. It is based on the 1990 novel of the same name by Michael Crichton, with a screenplay written by Crichton and David Koepp. The film centers on the fictional Isla Nublar, an islet located off Central America's Pacific Coast, near Costa Rica, where a billionaire philanthropist and a small team of genetic scientists have created a wildlife park of cloned dinosaurs.Jurassic Park is the second Steven's Spielberg Classic cult Film. A great science fiction/action/adventure film. This film is great edge of your seat action sequences. It has a wonderful cast with wonderful performance of their characters. John Williams music score is excellent the same like is in Indiana Jones films. Beside Raiders of the Lost Ark is the second Best classic movie in the franchise. Jurassic Park (1993) was nominated for 3 Academy Awards for Best Sound, Best Effects, Sound Effects Editing and Visual Effects.I love this film to death! It is been 22.years since we got this awesome adventure dinosaurs flick. I know a couple of friends of mine that love this film including me. It is a cult classic film and It has a heart. We have Tyrannosaurus Rex chasing the group, Velociraptors chasing Tim and Lex after they are reaching the visitor center and they are in inside the main kitchen. Dilophosaurus killing Nerdy. We also have Triceratops in it and Brachiosaurus. They are other dinosaurs used in the film: Gallimimus, Parasaurolophus and Alamosaurus they both had a cameo scene in it. The special effects creating the dinosaurs by Stan Winston are FANTASTIC! The dinosaurs were created with groundbreaking computer-generated imagery by Industrial Light & Magic and with life-sized animatronic dinosaurs built by Stan Winston's team. To showcase the film's sound design, which included a mixture of various animal noises for the dinosaur roars, Spielberg invested in the creation of DTS, a company specializing in digital surround sound formats. Stan Winston and his team did a great job animating live Dinosaurs on a screen. Steven Spielberg did a wonderful job directing this film, it is definitely my second best childhood film from Steven Spielberg. The first best film would be Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) which I love this film to death. The screen play written by Michael Crichton and David Koepp did a great job and the plot of the film was just awesome. The plot: During a preview tour, a theme park suffers a major power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur exhibits to run amok.The crew cast all did a wonderful job of acting. The acting of this film was terrific and believable. Sam Neill as Dr. Alan Grant, a leading paleontologist did a wonderful job portraying his character. He act the character like he was written on his skin. Laura Dern as Dr. Ellie Sattler, a paleobotanist. did a wonderful job like how she cared about an ill Triceratops. I was really surprised how the character cares about an ill dinosaurs that she barely know and she wanted to help him was out stating! Laura Dern for me in this film was a heart and a key watching this film of how a good hearted person she is. Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm, a mathematician and chaos theorist was really good in his acting and his character. Richard Attenborough as John Hammond, InGen's billionaire CEO and the park's creator was awesome playing his character. It is really a shame Richard Attenborough died last year and he isn't with us anymore. Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello as Lex and Tim did a wonderful job portraying John Hammonds grand children. I didn't know Samuel L. Jackson was in this film I really didn't know that. The whole cast was awesome in here.Music by score by John Williams is fabulous and fantastic I always love this song to death. There is everything in this film I love. How Dr. Grant, Lex and Tim are fighting to survive when they are trapped alone in the park. How tough and strong they are they don't panic and screaming they are fighting to come back save home. Lex and Tim are cornered by a pair of raptors inside the main kitchen. In one of the most terrifying scenes in the entire film, the raptors stalk through the dark kitchen, searching for the kids. Eventually, Lex and Tim manage to lure one of the raptors into the freezer and lock it in, but the other raptor chases them out of the kitchen. The scene was the most memorable to me and terrifying. Another terrifying scene is when Ellie discovers Ray's severed arm in the maintenance shed and she sees the raptor that eat Ray try's to eat her, that also scared me a lot. After the power was cut off on the electric fences and the kids with Alan are climbing over the fences and the power is turn back on by Ellie and Ray the fence electrifies Tim and he fly's down off the fence. The scene was awesome but also terrifying and real. I'm not sure what else you would want in a movie like this?! It is a perfect 10. I love this film to death! I love this film to death!! The action sequences are also awesome, the plot, the cast everything is great about this film."
"Simply one of the greatest films of all time. How on Earth it is only rated as 7.9/10 I'll never know.It has a great plot, structured of course around Michael Crichton's equally brilliant novel, and the graphics are absolutely superb. Jurassic Park, along with the sequel 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park', had Dinosaurs that were actually convincing. Of course, there was some artistic license involved - certain behaviours of the animals were exaggerated or entirely fabricated - but that in no way detracts from the film. They are certainly better than those in the comparably average third instalment in the franchise, 'Jurassic Park III'. Living in the 21st century (or 20th, as it were) this film gave us a recreation of these creatures that was genuinely believable.For all their fancy graphics and obscene budgets, films such as 'Avatar' will never compare to the likes of Jurassic Park."
"In the year 1993, Hollywood saw something unlike anything else, the film Jurassic Park. Never before 1993 had dinosaurs been so breathtaking and realistic on the silver screen.The plot is very original. A group of scientists cloned dinosaurs, and are about to open an amusement park where people can see the dinosaurs. The creator John Hammond(Richard Attenborough) invites a group of people, along with his grandchildren, to see the dinos and enjoy a relaxing time at the park. Could anything go wrong, at the time it doesn't seem like it, but something else is going on. Employee Dennis Nedry is planning to steal dinosaur embryos. In order to do this, he causes a security breakdown so he can get the embryos and escape. He isn't the only one that can escape, as hungry dinos also escape. After this, everyone on the island is in danger, and loose dinosaurs are everywhere. That is where the fun in Jurassic Park comes in.This is an underrated movie according to the IMDb ratings. It isn't even in the top 250. Today, people don't appreciate it as much, mainly due to the fact that other movies like it have been made. Growing up in the 90's, this was one of my favorite movies. As a kid, I only watched it to see the dinosaurs, as I didn't understand a whole lot of it. Today, I realize how great the plotting and suspense are.This spawned two sequels. The second one wasn't bad, but the third wasn't very good. I would recommend seeing the second after this, but the third is passable.The story is great, how at first we see how the magic was created, and then later we see the magic turn into a disaster, in which everyone's life is at stake.The special effects are still good today, but they were revolutionary for back in 1993. The acting is good, and the ensemble cast is great. All of the action sequences are perfectly executed, creating plenty of suspense and tension.Younger kids may get scared by this, as I remember a lot of young kids being scared by it in 1993. If kids aren't scared by dinosaurs, they will probably enjoy the movie.I highly recommend Jurassic Park. It is quite underrated in my opinion, it deserves more credit than it gets.Watch this at all costs if you have somehow missed it and see what everyone was amazed about back in 1993.Enjoy"
"''Life, uh... finds a way.''One of the best & most iconic movie quotes of all times.I don't know what can I say about this movie that hasn't been said. Really...Considering this movie was made in 1993, visual effects are of incredible quality, as you see it better on blu-ray. When it comes to story, it's completely original, nearly flawless. I can't say too much about the acting. I believe acting is not the movie's strongest point. But still, it was enough for that movie. You don't need to be like Marlon Brando in a sci-fi movie about dinosaurs and has great visual & sound effects. The movie is very fun to watch.I also sensed a small message like, ''don't mess with nature''.Best thing about the movie (for me) was the score. Especially the ''Welcome to Jurassic Park'' scene. Of course we're talking about John Williams, the guy who wrote the theme for Star Wars, so that's not a surprise.Highly recommend it.9/10"
"Even though it was adapted from a book, this unique story was destined to become an incredible film. Great casting, decent acting, great special effects, beautiful and perfect score by John Williams, incredible directing. I believe this movie has to be one of the greatest science fiction films ever made. Although not entirely true to the book, (though someone should never say a movie is not good because it is not exactly like the book because that really doesn't matter) Steven Spielberg made this story a landmark in special effects and a standard for thriller films to be compared to. It also contains some scenes that are instant classics, such as the first time they see the dinosaurs, the kitchen scene with the raptors, the end scene with the raptors and the T-Rex, the scene with the T-Rex and the kids in the jeep, and of course the scene where the T-Rex chases the jeep. I will keep this movie in my list of favorites and classics till the day i die."
"I don't know why I loved this movie so much.  Maybe it was the utter amazement when I first saw the Brachiosaurus eat from a tree.  Or maybe it was my adrenaline rushing when two 12 year old were attacked by velociraptors.  It might possibly be the chills that went down my spine when the T-Rex first made his terrifying roar.  Whatever it was, it made me write this review.Allan Grant (Sam Neil) and Ellie (Laura Dern) are two successful paleontologists who are asked by a rich man John Hammond to come at his park for a major tour.  They agree and are taken to an island where ""Jurassic Park"" logos are everywhere.  The two paleontologists have no idea what they are getting themselves into.  The first dinosaur to make an apearance is the Brachiosaurus, which both of them are extrememly amazed by its giant apearance, and so is the audience.  What the two of them don't know is that there are much more terrifying and carnivorous dinosaurs who are about to escape and run loose....Directed by the mighty Steven Speilberg, Jurassic Park relied on more character development than any other creature-feature.  Usually you get second-rate actors who can't act, getting terrified by monsters that don't really exist.  Jurassic Park was the opposite.  It changed the way we looked at the world, and it will forever.  Based on the novel by Micheal Crichton, Jurassic Park was an amazing movie.From beginning to end, Jurassic Park bedazzled us with dinosaurs.  Dinosaurs that are EXTINCT.  There are a lot of cool cameos and the stars give great performances.  The whole family should watch this movie.  Not for the glossy title, but because of the dinosaurs.  I remember being a kid when I first watched it, and I remember loving this movie so bad.  The climax was excellent, and I am not saying what happens, unlike the sequel to this film (Jurassic Park 3).  A climax-less bad film, that was.  But this....this was magic.  And yes, it was a masterpiece.The magic of this film is what brought me into dinosaurs, too.  I had a ""Jurassic Park"" marathon today and I watched this movie, and I can still feel the magic.  You will feel the magic too once you see it.  I just have absolutely nothing to say except that Steven Speilberg will put a spell on you.  Even if you don't like creature-features, this movie will entertain you.  Steven Speilberg will take you to places that no one else ever will. And the ""life will find a way"" speech is here, ready to make someone feel that creating dinosaurs that have been extinct for millions of years is a good thing.Absolutely needless to say, Jurassic Park was a golden diamond.10/10 (One of the greatest films ever made)"
"My first epic movie to see on the big screen was Jurassic Park. I was only 8 years old and I had no idea what I was in for when I watched this movie. I was terrified but so enchanted by this world. Steven Spielberg brought back the dinosaur genre, a genre that was only used with caveman movies. Not to mention did it with incredible special effects. I remember seeing this movie for the first time and asked my mom if the dinosaurs were real or if they made giant robots. Those dinosaurs not only looked real but were absolutely terrifying. But what an adventure we took with Jurassic Park, the land where anything could happen with a crazy billionaire and upset employees who pretty much destroy the world for a nickel. One of the most memorable movies of all time that still holds up to this day, Jurassic Park is a film not to be missed.Billionaire John Hammond, has recently created Jurassic Park: a theme park populated with dinosaurs cloned from the DNA extracted from insects preserved in prehistoric amber. After a park worker is attacked by a dinosaur, Hammond's investors, demand that experts visit the park and verify that it is safe. Gennaro invites Dr. Ian Malcolm, a mathematician, while Hammond invites paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant and paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler. They are joined on the island by Hammond's two grandchildren Tim and Lex. Hammond asks Malcolm, Grant, and Sattler what their thoughts are about having recreated dinosaur species. The group sets off to explore the park. The head computer programmer, Dennis Nedry, is secretly in the employ of one of InGen's corporate rivals, and has been paid to steal fertilized dinosaur embryos. During his theft, Nedry deactivates the park's security system, allowing him access to the embryo storage. The group is now parked in front of the T-Rex's cage and now they are fighting for their lives in Jurassic Park.I think one of the most memorable scenes is definitely the raptors chasing the children in the kitchen. What a tense scene that made you hold your breath the whole way through. You have to love Jeff Goldblum in this movie, when he tries to ""save"" the children from the T-Rex and instead pretty much gets his butt kicked, he gets saved later and as they are chased in the car by the T-Rex the only thing he can say as this giant monster is catching up faster and faster with each footstep, he says ""must go faster"" so calmly, how funny! But there is a moment that scares me more than the dinosaurs that I'm surprised no one noticed in the editing room, the granddaughter is scared to death screaming at Sam Neill that the lawyer left them and he replies with a dark look ""that's not what I'm going to do"". I responded that with ""I have much darker plans for you"", I mean his look was just so creepy! I digress, Jurassic Park is still a very fun movie that is the ultimate adventure. It's timeless and I can't wait to show my kids one day, what a great movie with wonderful effects and a wonderful cast and crew.9/10"
"This was obviously the most sophisticated portrayal of dinosaurs at the time, and it doesn't age a bit.  Sam Neill plays Dr Alan Grant, a paleontologist who is persuaded to check out Richard Attenborough's new theme park, only to find that he has managed to clone dinosaurs.  There is plenty of action, and the dinos look so real as to be positively scary!  Sam Neill puts in his usual incredibly brilliant performance, and you can really believe he is acting with the creatures!  Jeff Goldblum as usual seems to play himself, as Professor Ian Malcolm, an expert in chaos theory who is convinced the park is a bad idea.  The cast are amazing, the effects are amazing, this whole movie is amazing.  It doesn't get any better than this!"
"What can I say? Jurassic Park is one of the most underrated movies ever. Yes, I did say underrated. True, it is the fourth highest grossing movie ever (for the time being) and was a motion picture bible for eight-year-olds across the country, but it has never been regarded as artistically superior. When, in reality, it is one of the most artistically inventive movies ever. It contains all of Spielberg's magical strokes of genius from fantastic art direction and wonderful camera techniques to astounding technical quality ( which comes from his well known control over technology). The minor flaws of a theme park are masterfully embedded into the art direction, script etc. and the acting is superb. This is one of the only movies I've seen with great acting by children. Spielberg's camera usage ranges from foreshadowing the appearance of dinosaurs with extreme up-angles to exquisitely composed scenes of the dinosaurs' ""interaction"" with the characters. Aside from technical quality, Jurassic Park bears powerful social messages of human intrusion and destruction of natural environment and the self-revering nature of man. Also, it had an undeniable effect on cinema being one of the first movies to use CGI at such a large scale. However, the most ingenious aspect of the film is the portrayal of the dinosaurs as animals rather than ruthless monsters. At many times throughout the movie, the humans are portrayed as antagonists and the respect and appreciation of the dinosaurs is wonderfully developed. And, best of all, like star wars you can analyze the movie all you want or just sit back and enjoy the ride."
"Steven Spielberg is known for making great movies like, ""E.T."" and ""Schindler's List"". But on June 11 1993. He released my favorite movie, ""Jurassic Park"".What make's this movie great is the special effects. They really brought the Dinosaurs to life. It also had some nice suspenseful scene's. Also, the acting was good. Sam Neil does a nice job as Alan Grant and Richard Attenborough does a great job as John Hammond. Plus, the theme song was incredible. Sometimes when you listen to it, it feel's like you're going to cry.In the end, ""Jurassic Park"", is a great film and it is definitely worth watching."
"JURASSIC PARK was the film that ignited my interest in filmmaking and drove me to get a degree in it, so I will always have a soft spot for it. I was eleven when I read the book, but all the technical stuff lost me and I never finished it. A couple years later when I heard the movie was coming out, I decided I would just see it instead. With advance tickets selling out fast, my mom was lucky enough to get some a few days before it's premiere. We stood in line for roughly thirty minutes before we finally got in. Even as the lights were dimming, I still had no idea what to expect. Within moments I was glued to my seat. The opening sequences remains one of my favorite scenes in any film and continues to give me goosebumps to this day. For the next two hours, I sat in my seat just staring at the screen as these marvelous, life-like creatures that were unlike anything I had ever seen before. The film was full of awe and scares. I walked out of the theater virtually trying to catch my breath. What a thrill ride the film had been, and I eventually went back and saw it a few more times. The film was a turning point in my life, as I said, because I walked out saying to myself, ""That's what I want to do."" Sure the characters aren't deep and the dialogue isn't great, but who cares when the film is this entertaining? The actors are good in their parts, especially the always great Sam Neill, and the dinosaurs are incredibly life-like. The action is great, and the pacing (after a slow start) is relentless. The film has a few continuity flaws, but none of them matter. This film is great entertainment."
"Look up the word ""awe"" in the dictionary... ya know what you'll find? Jurassic Park. And now in 3D! Usually, I don't really like post- converted 3D in movies, but this one won me over. Ever since I was a little kid, I've always loved Jurassic Park (I think we all did) and I'd always heard that it was one of the best movie theater experiences ever. Unfortunately, I wasn't born when this originally came out so I never got the chance to experience that... until now! And damn, were they right when they said it was an awesome movie theater experience because it sure as hell is. It's so fun, engrossing, and thrilling to watch it on the big screen, with all the sound surrounding you (the sound in Jurassic Park has got to be some of the best sound in a movie ever). Jurassic Park is also one of the most monumental movies of all time. It defined CGI. The CGI and special effects in this movie still holdup today and are even better than most movies today.The story of Jurassic Park is that a really rich guy has cloned dinosaurs to make an amusement park full of living dinosaurs (you would do that if you could too). Because they are these live dinosaurs in the park, his investors say that he needs approval from experts, so he recruits Dr. Alan Grant (a paleontologist who is more or less the protagonist of the movie), Dr. Elli Sattler (a paleobotanist), and Dr. Ian Malcom (a mathematician who's character is pretty much the show stealer). Through a number of circumstances, the dinosaurs get loose and all hell breaks loose. Now, we have our movie being one of the most awe- inspiring movies ever; as well as being one of the most suspenseful movies ever. When the characters first enter Jurassic Park, you see the many dinosaurs in the distance and the theme (one of the greatest movie themes of all time) is playing in the background. Your jaw just drops. And the dinosaurs look awesome. Sometimes they're CGI, sometimes they're animatronic. Sometimes they're amazing... oh wait, that's all the time. One of my favourite scenes is when the T-Rex is attacking the car and a flashlight shines in its eye and the eye dilates. That just shows how detailed and alive these dinos are.But the dinosaurs don't wreak havoc until about halfway, or even 3/4, through the film. Even yet, the movie does a brilliant job of immersing you into it, bringing you onto this island, and getting you to care for the characters. The dialogue and acting are so good that you feel as though you're there with the characters (it drags sometimes but it's easy to get past that). And when they're in peril, you feel as though you're in danger too. I just can't stress how substantial the suspense in Jurassic Park is. The 3D does add to that, too. The 3D in this movie is probably the best post-converted 3D I've ever seen and it works really well.Jurassic Park is really a movie that everyone should experience (notice how I didn't say ""watch""). If you get the chance, see it in theaters and have your mind absolutely blown. The movie is full of awe and imagination; it sometimes makes me feel like a little kid again. The characters are likable; their dialogue is believable and sometimes humorous. The dinosaurs are awesome. The suspense is intense as hell. The soundtrack is perfect. It's a classic..."
"What can be said about this movie that hasn't already been said? Who knows. We all know that this has some of the greatest special effects, even today. Also, if there's anything that can match the awesome T-Rex, it's the movie's musical score. I swear, listen to it more than once, and you're bound to see the movie yet again, if for that sole reason. It's that powerful. Oh sure, acting isn't this movie's strong suit, but who looks for acting in a Dinosaur thriller? Who?!Anyway, I think I've made my point. Jurassic Park: One of America's greatest classics. Steven Spielberg created magic with this movie. If you haven't seen it once, you haven't seen it at all."
"I first saw this back when I was little. If I remember correctly, it was also a big thing when it came out. I even had a backpack with a Velociraptor head sticking out of it for school. It was such an amazing achievement as a movie itself and the film is so wonderfully done that there's no doubt of why it has held up as long as it has and will remain the best dinosaur film ever created.The dinosaurs in this film look more realistic than any other prehistoric film, or even most movies today that try to pass off crappy CGI has reality. The acting was spectacular, and aside from how wonderful the creatures look and how vicious and exciting they were like no other dinosaur film had had them before, the plot and characters were solid and incredibly entertaining where you didn't think they would be so amusing. I will have to say again that one really huge reason why most people loved this movie was because of the special effects, but here again, isn't that an accomplishment in itself? Having your audience enjoy the film because of how realistic and fresh you are able to make it feel and look? I have never seen another movie with better effects than this one, ever. I am sure none of these horrible effects dinosaur movies that have been coming out lately could ever live up to the greatness of Jurassic Park.I am always going to love Jurassic Park for it's witty, unbelievable maneuvers and incredible screenplay though, as well. It was so properly thought out and executed, where most might have been expecting it to be nothing but high levels of adrenaline rushes with brainless action, which there was pulsating action, it just certainly wasn't as mindless. Many who dislike Jurassic Park really just have all the same reasons the average movie-goer would have for disliking a film, yet I haven't heard anyone fully describe and explain, well, what they truly thought were faults with this film, which gives me reason to believe that Jurassic Park is a masterpiece, for I, myself, have no faults with this film, except that I have seen other films that I enjoyed more. . . just a little more."
"Wow! That's about all one can say about this movie. The first time that I saw it I was mesmerized. The movie looked so cool and hey, it actually had a good plot. If you haven't seen this movie yet, get out from your cave and see it right away. I have seen this movie umpteen times and it still shocks and suprises me. If you have a DVD player I suggest that you buy the Jurassic Park 2 pack as soon as possible. The movie sounds and looks great, and the extras are cool too. So to summarize go see this. Spielberg is a true genius. Almost all of his movies were great. 10/10!"
"It's hard to believe that it's 6 years since this film appeared at the cinemas. At the time it was a truly ground-breaking film, managing for the first time to portray dinosaurs in an extremely realistic manner, unlike those plasticine monsters that we were forced to watch in previous monster movies. Jurassic Park will also be remembered as the movie that finally made George Lucas sit up and realise that it was possible for him to make his prequels.In hindsight, while it is still an extremely well directed and tension filled movie, the script did seemed dumbed down in order to appeal to as many people as possible - but that's really irrelevant since this film is all about dinosaurs. One of Spielberg's brilliantly directed films, it even managed to make me forget Spielberg's previous disaster of a movie - do you recall HOOK?8/10."
"This movie was released during my childhood while I was already a dinosaur enthusiast. I saw it 2 times at the cinema and as far as I can remember these were the only 2 times I ever saw an audience applaud at the end. It made an big impression. Computer generated images were new at that time and we didn't know what to expect. But I think I can speak for everyone if I say we were blown away. The dinosaurs looked so real. And even in the years after that computer generated images in other movies were just not as good and realistic as in Jurassic Park.Another thing that made this movie is the soundtrack. John Williams (the composer) absolutely nailed it! The music at the arrival to the island combined with the the adventure ahead was just breathtaking.So you have a good story, good actors (I loved Jeff Goldblum for his humor), state of the art special effects and an thrilling adventure. This makes it still my number one of all time and I don't expect that to change anytime soon (or ever)."
"Jurassic Park. An island full of dinosaurs who terrorise people; a simple premise but extremely well done. From beginning to end this film is just an enjoyable watch. Back in 1993 when it was released these never-before-seen effects had to have wowed audiences, and even now it still holds up with the anamatronics, CGI combo, it is really good; I've seen worst stuff in other movies and TV series. The characters I thought were pretty well done and acted, you really didn't want certain things happen to certain people and I really like Sam Neil as Alan Grant. Now, I was really exited to watch my favourite film on the big screen and especially in 3D, I watched it in IMAX as well, something I had never done before, and boy did it deliver. The 3D in this movie was one of the best I've seen in ages, better than Man of Steel and Iron Man 3 by far. Jurassic Park in the third dimension brought a whole new life too it, just some of the scenes with the trees, and leaves and then an awesome scene in the kitchen was good in 3D. So yes, I think Jurassic Park will continue being my favoured film for a long time to come."
"This movie is definitely one to remember. Despite being filmed in the 90s, Jurassic Park continues to be a classic to this day. 
Watching the movie now highlights the contrast between the effects then and the special effects available now. This, along with some acting that is a tad overdone, are the only real critiques I would give this film. 
The child actors were especially hilarious to me-the young boy, Timmy, has moments that really capture a reaction that a child in real life would have (""I threw up."" ""Well that's ok! That happens sometimes""-Allen-is one of my favorite quotes). 
Another extremely influential aspect of this film is the music that plays over certain intense scenes and the iconic theme music in the opening/closing. The music combined with the diegetic sound of the dinosaur stomping/approaching builds the suspense and creates an intense tension in the audience. 
As a classic worldwide, it's no wonder that this movie provided the basis for generations of movies to follow."
"After a worker is killed in an accident at the dinosaur theme park 'Jurassic Park' owner John Hammond calls in experts Dr Alan Grant and Dr Ellie Sattler as well as mathematician Ian Malcolm to visit it the park and clear it to open to the public. 'Jurassic Park' is no ordinary theme park; it is on a remote island off the coast of Costa Rica and it contains real dinosaurs! It is explained how these have been created by extracting dinosaur DNA from blood in mosquitoes preserved in amber. The first ones the visitors see are harmless herbivores but they are told that the park also contains some of the most famous carnivores such as Tyrannosaurus and Velociraptor; something that both excites and concerns the scientists. After an introduction the visitors, along with Hammond's grandchildren, Lex and Tim, and the company lawyer take part in a tour of the park. As they travel things go wrong for two reasons; a tropical storm is heading for the island and, more importantly, a corrupt company employee as set up a computer program that will turn off various security systems including the electric fences that protect the guests so he can attempt to steal dinosaur DNA sell it to a competitor. Once things do go wrong those on the tour find themselves fleeing for their lives following a T Rex attack on their vehicles while those at the park headquarters try to find a way to get the systems working again. Inevitably not everybody will get out alive.Like most people who watched this in the cinema when it was new I was amazed by the special effects that brought long extinct creatures back to life; watching it again over twenty years later and they still look fantastic. If one didn't know that dinosaurs died out millions of years ago you could be excused for thinking you were watching real animals. While these were the films big selling point it would have been for nothing if we didn't also have a good story acted by a fine cast luckily we have both. The action isn't rushed; a significant amount of time is spent introducing all the main characters and explaining the characteristics of the various dinosaurs. This means that by the time everything goes wrong we care about the protagonists and know which characters to look forward to seeing die! There aren't a huge number of deaths and those there are aren't overly gruesome; the goriest moment is the brief sight of a severed arm. Despite its UK-PG rating it is surprisingly intense at times and has plenty of genuinely scary moments. The cast do an impressive job; Sam Neill and Laura Dern impress as the two leads and there are also fine performances from Richard Attenborough, Samuel L. Jackson, Jeff Goldblum and Bob Peck. Child characters are often annoying but Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards are pretty good as Tim and Lex; especially the latter who is a great screamer! Overall I'd defiantly recommend this to anybody wanting a genuinely exciting film that is suitable for most ages."
"This movie is simply a legend. A date in history of cinema.With Terminator 2, Jurassic Park is one of the first movie that shows wonderful CGI. And now, it is forever one of the best, until his 21 years. Everything is just awesome. Spielberg at the summum of his art, John Williams create another time a legendary ost, and all the actors are just more than best, and especially two of the them. Richard Attenborough(RIP) play John Hammond, owner of Ingen and creator of Jurassic park. He is a very great actor (and director). He don't play John Hammond, for everybody who love cinema, he is John Hammond. And Sam Neil, what can i say about him ? Simply he is one genius. He is at the best with playing Alan Grant. For some people, he became just one role. Watching him in another program, i am sur that somebody would automatically said : it's the guy from Jurassic Park, Doctor Grant ! And that is the best for an actor, he leave his mark in the collective inconscious. Sam Neil is more an actor, he is a great man."
"One of the Best Movies ever made. One great scene after the next great scene. Masterpiece and the best Jurassic Park Movie, also today!"
"John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) creates this park called ""Jurassic Park"" where he recreates the dinosaurs using DNA found in fossils (but also having to use frog DNA to complete it - don't ask me why, I don't quite remember all the technical stuff).
But before Hammond can open it to the public, he has to get it approved. So, he hires some fossil finders (played by Sam Neill and Laura Dern) to go to the park and look through it without telling them what occupies the park. Anyway, they go there and Hammond gets them to take his grandchildren along after the fossil finders express concern about the park's safety with the dinosaurs. A hippie scientist-type guy Dr. Ian Malcolm (played by the great Jeff Goldblum) also accompanies them as well as a lawyer.
That's where things start to go wrong. The dinosaurs escape. I won't say anymore, though.
I loved it! I think it is one of the greatest films of all time and is certainly a classic. I don't understand why everyone thinks this film is scary. It's not - apart from a couple scenes like the start and something later on. A lot of film writers should watch this and take notes on how to do tension as this film has brilliant tension.
It has quite a good sense of humour, and ""Jurassic Park"" is generally suitable for children, though you might want to fast forward the very start and maybe one or two other scenes, but generally, I think that children can watch it, though it depends on the individual child and what they can or can't handle.
Another brilliant subplot in the film is with Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and his dislike for children. During most of the danger, he is stuck with Hammond's grandchildren. There is great chemistry between him and the children.
Jurassic Park is a brilliant movie.
Hats off to you, Mr Spielberg!"
i really enjoyed this movie. it was worth my time. i also loved the casting and the director. i would see it again. in fact i actually bought it. i recommend it to someone who has not seen it because it is entertaining. even thought there are a few flaws in it it still is worth it. my sister also loves this movie and my whole family enjoys it as well. i love the sequels too. they actually match up with the first movie and there not one of those movies that you have to watch for a half hour to figure out what is going on.thanks a bunch-Elee
"It still baffles me why this brilliant movie isn't in the top 250 movies for IMDB! it's amazing! I think this is the kind of film that people take too seriously and don't see the obvious reasons what make this such a great movie.  For one such as ""Jurassic Park"" it represents everything a summer blockbuster should be, (and why Spielberg is the king of 'blockbuster summer' movies).In all fairness, a film like this is only worth watching for the special effects (which still remain top-notch).  It is a dinosaur movie- it does exactly what it says on the tin- it thrills and amazes and never lets up, it is perfect popcorn fare and not since ""Jaws"" (the first proper summer blockbuster!) has a film so brilliantly had such an affect on movies which were to follow. Essentially it is ""Jaws"" on-land and it does so perfectly, with great pace great set-pieces.  I wish this film was in the top 250, if any movie deserves it , ""Jurassic Park"" does, not just for being such a great film but also for revolutionising films from there on out!!Brilliant!!!"
"Perhaps more so than any other director in film history, Steven Spielberg has locked into that most desirable niche of movie-making: pleasing everyone at the same time. When his spectacular action-adventure Jurassic Park was first released in 1993, he left critics, film buffs, casual viewers, parents and children equally spellbound. Twenty years later, the film has been re-released in both 3D and IMAX, allowing a new generation to experience the magic, and old fans the chance to relive it again.Eccentric millionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) has created the ultimate theme park on a secluded island, and he wants to offer a sneak preview to a select group of individuals (Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum and Laura Dern). Of course, the prehistoric attractions don't much appreciate being detained for the amusement of others, and begin to cause havoc as soon as they take the opportunity to escape from their enclosures. An extremely imaginative plot adapted from Michael Crichton's novel of the same name, it sets the foundation for a rip-roaring battle for survival.For many viewers that first saw Jurassic Park as pre-teens, the greatest thrill will come from appreciating, to a greater degree, the way the film deftly builds suspense. Cleverly building up to the revelation of the 'meatasauruses' by stunning us with the visual treat of cuddly herbivores, when we do finally meet the imposing Tyrannosaurus, it is one of cinema's most exhilarating set pieces, only to be topped some time later by the thrilling cat-and-mouse game in the kitchen.It is a testament to the incredible skill of the animatronics and visual effects team that the film's most dated quality is the occasionally cheesy dialogue that burdens Lex and little brother Tim. The dinosaurs are clearly the main event, but the undercard of Jurassic Park spares no expense, with touches of class including Dr. Grant's personal evolution from a child apathist to a fully-fledged family man and a miasma of Shelley-esque criticisms of man's innate desire to play god while drunk on the illusion of total control.To call this the movie event of the year would be to make the grossest of understatements. Experiencing this glorious monument to total escapism on the world's biggest cinema screen is simply mandatory for anyone was has ever felt goosebumps in a theater. Bring your kids- they'll never forget it.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review. If you're looking for a writer for your movie website or other publication, I'd also love to hear from you.*"
"If you were born in the 90s or before, you had a connection with people...you absolutely loved this movie, and it made a mark on you. I think most people remember when they saw this movie first, because it was that awe inspiring of an experience. I remember that it was the first pg-13 movie I was allowed to watch, and what a way to start my grown up movie experience!!!
Everything in this movie screams adventure, from the opening scene where the jungle leaves rustle, the shot of mysterious sparkling amber, to the landing of the helicopter on a remote rainforest island, the movie sets the tone for the greatest adventure movie ever made. As you hear John Williams glorious theme start to swell, and you see Alan remove his glasses and start to tremble, you know you're about to witness one of the most magical moments ever put on cinema. I can't go into detail on all the incredible scenes, from the T-Rex reveal, to the kitchen scene, but each one of them revolutionized what we thought movie magic could take us. Thank you Spielberg for making this enchanting piece of art for us, an entire generation is indebted to you."
"I remember watching this movie when I was just a elementary school student and wasn't all that entertained with this movie. Except the dinosaur parts since it just didn't meet my prospect of things when it comes to a entertaining movie when I was a kid. But watching it now, I can really appreciate this movie and what it does. In fact it's one of the best dinosaur or some creatures that attack people type of movies I have ever seen. I recently saw this movie in theaters in 3D and it still meets even today's standards when it comes to great movies. Steven Spielberg is a visionary director and he really put everything he had into this movie. The CGI still holds up but what amazes me is how they used animatronic dinosaurs for the dinosaur scenes. This movie came out in 1993 and even the cinematography still hold up. The characters are well grafted into the story and stands out despite the two annoying kids. Even if it does have slightly cliché moments with one of the character predicting all the outcome but most of the people just won't listen to the guy scenarios. But then again this movie came out in 1993. The build up is just fantastic in this movie and although a bit far-fetched the way it's shown makes it believable, like everything in this movie is possible. The plot is about a rich old guy that decides use his money to clone dinosaurs and make a dino theme park but things just doesn't go according to plan. And it really does seem like a real theme park, mainly because of all the small details and effort that is put in the settings and backgrounds. Even the freaking theme song is so darn catchy and memorable. Go watch this movie in theaters now! It's what movie going experience is all about.9/10"
"This film is easily one of my favorite movies. I saw this movie when it came out in theaters back in 1993; I was only 9-years-old and, though some scenes scared the crap out of me, it blew me away. I was amazed at how, for the first time in a movie, I felt like I was watching REAL dinosaurs. For those who haven't seen this movie (there are people like that?), it centers on a billionaire's attempt to create a new amusement park on an isolated island creating bio-engineered dinosaurs; when a group of specialists are brought in to examine the park, things go terribly wrong.I absolutely loved the story of this film; I loved it so much I had my parents buy me Michael Crichton's novel and I read it 3 times through the course of my fifth grade year. It was then that I fell in love with the work of Crichton and found myself reading the rest of his work. While, yes, the movie did divert pretty heavily from the book, I still felt it was a great adaptation. It's Spielberg's version of Crichton's story, so I don't mind the mass differences. The movie is much more family-friendly than Crichton's novel and I would love to see a another version eventually, a darker version that sticks closer to Crichton's novel. Unlike most instances when I can say ""The book was better"" or ""The movie was better"", I don't feel the need in this case because they were both fantastic.The cast did a terrific job. Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Richard Attenborough...all were great in their roles. Though my favorite performance came from Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm, the arrogant chaos theoretician. I've been a fan of Goldblum for a while and I thought he was the perfect choice for the role in this movie. Of course, I have to rave a bit about the film's special effects. As I mentioned before, this film contains probably the most realistic dinosaurs seen in cinema. A seamless combination of practical animatronics and CGI were used to bring the dinosaurs to life. By now, the effects seem a little dated but they continue to stand strong even now, 15 years later.This movie is one of those films that every must see. It grossed $350 million in the US alone. The film marked yet another milestone in special effects in cinema. And most importantly, it's just entertaining."
"I recently had a conversation with a friend about the filmography of the great Steven Spielberg. My friend, who is considerably younger than me, tried to argue Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) was not the horrifying, stupefying train wreck that it was. While I could probably go into the technical reasons that movie is an abomination, my arguments were limited to a concentrated level of hatred indirectly flung at my friend with reckless abandon. I stopped myself before things got out of hand but I realized one thing; generational bias does matter when it comes to movies and our discussion hit a little too close to home.It matters for many when I say I prefer Jurassic Park (1993) over Jaws (1975). I'm not saying one is a better movie over the other, all I'm saying is I prefer the movie that first capitalized on my obsession with dinosaurs when I was six, over one I saw in high school because I wanted to be a Spielberg completest. I much rather watch the movie I saw peering through holes in my own clammy palms than the movie I tried figuring out ""what that guy was in."" To put it bluntly, in the imagination of the child I was and the child I still am inside, Jurassic Park is first in my heart.Jurassic Park is still the premier movie I recommend to Spielberg novices. It encompasses everything that artificially created the childhood of those raised in the nineties; a childlike sense of wonder, visionary special effects and a score by John Williams who composed the anthems of at least two generations. Additionally the film showcases the acting abilities of thespian veterans Richard Attenborough and Jeff Goldblum, familiar faces like Laura Dern, Samuel L. Jackson and Wayne Night and strong novice performances by Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello.Under the surface of Jurassic Park lies its cautionary tale written by David Koepp and Michael Crichton. A modern retelling of Frankenstein only instead of one misunderstood ogre the characters are faced with a menagerie of primal monsters. That and the movie doesn't mind cranking the scare-meter up to eleven. Those who have seen the movie no doubt will instantly recall the scene with the children versus the velociraptors. It's a scene that would have made anyone in the audience scream lengthily along with Joseph Mazzello's character.Those who know me know I'm not a fan of the theme of science and technology overreaching and causing something horrific. If we were scared of every boogie man that could happen, we would have never left that cave. That's not to say we shouldn't acknowledge the dangers of bringing dinosaurs back from the dead. We should acknowledge that it's a double edged sword for sure. But there's no doubt that finding our limits is what makes humanity great and we shouldn't limit ourselves because Mary Shelley, Michael Crichton or Jerry Falwell tells us to.But if you're looking for deeper meanings in a Spielberg film (other than the phallic appearance of E.T.) you're trailing up the wrong Devil's Monument. Spielberg's main goal is to entertain. Does that make him a less talented or less important director? Does that make him a huckster of the Barnum Bailey variety? I would argue that film can be used as an art form, as a form of entertainment and/or a form of storytelling with many, many overlapping traditions in-between. If a director's intent is to tell a good story which is what Spielberg does, then who am I or anyone else to judge? Movies are the things of dreams and Spielberg doesn't cheat in giving you the goods.A great yarn, a pulse pounding theme park ride, a childhood memory; Jurassic Park is all that and more. It was a movie that intelligently combined the cheap thrills that made Jaws so daring and revolutionary, while smuggling in ethical quandaries about the darker side of scientific discovery. On a related note, those in the know, no doubt have heard about the mammoth they're planning on cloning. Regardless of the hardships experienced by the characters of Jurassic Park, who isn't excited to see something like that?http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com"
"This is a film that has truly stood the test of time and has remained a modern classic of the Hollywood blockbuster system. Deservedly becoming the biggest film of all time in 1993 and launching the most entertaining film series ever made, Spielberg's film contains all the cliches a blockbuster should have and ensures that it remains good fun. We have the courageous scientist in the shape of Sam Niell, his fiesty girlfriend courtesy of Laura Dern, a doom and gloom expert in the causes of the problem at hand thanks to a brilliant performance from Bob Peck and the quirky scientist type who prophesises doom from the get go in the shape of Jeff Goldblum. This is fun and has remained so for the last ten years.Where the film has remained so good over the past decade is in its use of CGI and at the time state of the art special effects. They still haven't dated and look fluidly real as if the technology had only been made yesterday. Undoubtedly the dinosaurs are the star here (none of the actors have headlined each film with a change of performer for each one, Goldblum in the second installment, Niell returning for number three), but it doesn't matter because the dinosaurs here are truly movie stars in their own right and like characters in an ensemble film they all get their moments. The T-Rex gets to cause spectacular destruction, the Raptors get to be the vicious and conniving villains of the story, the Brachiosaurus ensures it grabs our awe while the Tricerotops gains our sympathy.However, Spielberg ensures that it isn't just the dinosaurs who are the stars here. He creates tension in the way that only he can with prolonged set pieces such as the T-Rex attack and the moment Alan and Tim have to race down a tree with the threat of a car falling on top of them. Sure it ain't art, it's great entertainment and it is great fun and it here where Spielberg ensures the film classic status. He uses the two hour frame to set up events and the story in the first hour and then let the chaos rip in the second with suspenseful action sequence after suspenseful action sequence and it works. While you may not look to performances in a film like this, it does have some fantastic actors. Niell seems surprisingly well suited to being a Spielbergian hero who starts of disliking children only to have his heart melted at the end. He appears to be having great fun playing the guy who saves the day. Jeff Goldblum almost runs away with the entire film as Malcolm, the quirky off beat nature of the character ensuring many a great one liner while Richard Attenborough is heart breaking as the Walt Disney like John Hammond whose dream becomes a violent nightmare.The film is great fun from beginning to end and deserves to be up there with Jaws and King Kong as one of the all time great monster movies."
"Well, I have to hand it to Steven Spielberg, even though he often annoys me. He made us pay attention to archeology and the Ark Of The Covenant; he educated us on Great White Sharks;, a made us love an ugly little space alien and he even made Whoopi Goldberg look good. Wow, say what you will, the man has done some amazing things in the world of film. Here, he brings dinosaurs back to life and gives us another classic adventure story, unlike anything seen up to this time. I rank this one right up with the best of all-time among great adventure stories. Few people can forget how stunned they were when they viewed these life-like dinosaurs for the first time on screen. And who can forget the T-Rex in the first frightening scene and the Raptors in the last intense scene? This is truly memorable stuff. To this day, those scenes can still get your attention.The movie has always been fun to watch, and not just because of the thrills or special effects, of which there are too many to recite here. There is humor in here and characters are interesting, led by Richard Attenborough as the scientist who creates Jurassic Park. The kids in here - Joseph Mazello and Ariana Richards - do a fine job of acting, as good as the adults.This isn't perfect by any means. There are some negatives such as the usual Spielberg plugs for liberal/secular causes, but I'd rather keep this review on the positive side, since it was so entertaining and ground-breaking, in a way, with the special effects, plus anyone who is slightest bit interested has already seen this movie at least once and probably more."
"Still one of my favorite movies of all time. It really says something when the practical effect AND the CGI are still compared to movies today.
Truly a timeless classic."
"Jurassic Park (1993) is one of the best classic science fiction action adventure movie one of my personal number 1 favorite adventure Dinosaurs films of all time. It is Steven Spielberg's ultimate thrill ride. It has great visual effects, breathtaking story, it has heart and soul it defines my childhood. I grew up with the film I used to had a t-shirt with Jurassic Park. I love the film to death it is the best one in the franchise it is my number 1 favorite film In the franchise we can say it is the best animal family movie for everyone including kids.It has wonderful score from John Williams, great cast it has Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Samuel L. Jackson, Wayne Knight, Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards.The film is based on a novel from Michael Crichton the book come out 1990 the movie come out 1993 and Michael Crichton helped writing a script for the film. It was brilliant direction from Steven Spielberg about scientists tampering with nature, the film is also mixed with horror in which velociraptor try's to eat Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) who finds a Ray Arnold's arm (Samuel L. Jackson). The effects are top notch, the CGI for 1993 is still good I love the design for T-Rex and the velociraptor fighting on the end. I love Brachiosaurus in this movie I love those dinosaurs so much.The story is original a group of scientist cloned dinosaurs they about to open a amusement park for people lead by John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) who invites on a island of Isla Nublar, four people paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) and a lawyer Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero) to gave him their opinions. All three disagree with John Hammond that tempered with nature is wrong and only a lawyer agrees with John because he thinks the park will make a fortune. One of the employees Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) is planning to steal dinosaur eggs and during a preview tour, he causes a security power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur exhibits to run amok. Dr. Grant stays with the kids Tim (Joseph Mazzello) and Lex (Ariana Richards) alone in the park and he has to return to resort complex, meanwhile John Hammond, Dr. Ellie Sattler, Ian Malcolm, Ray Arnold and Robert Muldon (Bob Peck) trying to get the power back.I love Dr. Alan Grant I love the character he was a great hero, great adventurer great paleontologist and great researcher. I love Sam Neill his character was writen on his skin. I love the kids Tim and Lex Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards they were great kids who were Hammond's grandchildren I love them. The most heart in the film was Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) because she cared about the animals she was a great human been she wanted to help a sick triceratops which I love the character so much. John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) I really miss the actor I love his character I love what he try to do I love him to dead it is a shame he is no longer with us. I like Dr. Ian Malcolm in this movie he wasn't annoying in this movie Jeff Goldblum was likable and decent.My favorite scenes in the movie are: The T-Rex chases the jeep down the road with Dr. Sattler, Ian Malcolm and Robert Muldon in an exciting car chase of an action sequence. I love in which Dr. Grant and kids are climbing over the fences and the fences are electricity high voltage the fence electrifies Tim and he fly's down off the fence great breathtaking scene ever. I love that scene. I love the action sequence in which Lex and Tim are cornered by a pair of velociraptors inside the main kitchen and fight for their survival. Another favorite scene of mine is when Ellie discovers Ray's severed arm in the maintenance shed and she sees the raptor that eat Ray try's to eat her. I really miss this movies and I miss my childhood. My best friend from my childhood was a huge fan of this film he collected comic books, action figures and he borrowed me his VHS tape of this film because I never seen the film before and I loved it.I love this film to death it has everything atmosphere, good wonderful effects, good scares, awesome thrills, breathtaking suspense on your sit, wonderful directing, great acting from everyone everything that makes the best movie in the adventure animal franchise. This is the best one in the franchise and my number 1 favorite dinosaurs film."
"100% 💯
One of the best movies of all time.
The cast, acting, action and mostly visuals are spectacular!!! Most of the sequels are also amazing!!!"
"I will start off by saying the novel Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton is my favourite novel of all time. I first read it when I was 12, and about a year before the movie came out.Needless to say, I was pumped for the film. I loved dinosaurs since I was six years old and couldn't wait for the movie.Even at that age I was a movie buff and knew that movie adaptions of books are never 100% accurate. And Jurassic Park was no different.Obviously marketed towards young children, the movie toned down a lot of the violence which happened in the novel. Understandably. But the movie was still full of jump scares and still retained the adventurous side of the novel down to a T.Steven Spielberg always amazes and this film possessed the cutting edge of technology at the time. The CGI and practical effects were amazing. This is how a movie with CGI should look like today. Have real environments with CGI elements. Unlike most movies today where 99% of the screen is CGI.Steven takes us on an amazing adventure through Jurassic Park along with fine actors such as Sam Neil, Jeff Goldblum, Linda Dream and Sir Richard Attenborough. The science behind the movie made it seem like it could really bring dinosaurs to life.I always wondered what a dinosaur would look like. And Jurassic Park showed me. A beautifully shot film with an equally beautiful score by John Williams.Check out the novel if you haven't read it as well"
As a child I saw this movie in theaters and many times on VHS. I was mesmerized by the adventurous and thrilling nature of the film. JP made a big influence on 90's kids. Today I can watch this movie and still be thrilled by the product. Being older now I see the appeal to both children and adults. The characters are relate able and you feel immersed in the Jurassic experience. The music is amazing and adds to the adventurous feel of Jurassic Park. As a kid I saw many adult characters as role models and now I watch and laugh at all their clever quotes. The story and effects still are great; I believe this is one of the best productions of the 1990's; I believe this film is a great example of movie magic.
"""God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates man. Man destroys God. Man creates dinosaurs.""Since we're only a couple of days away from the premiere of Jurassic World I wanted to share some thoughts on one of my all time favorite movie going experiences (perhaps my favorite). I was only 12 years old when Steven Spielberg released Jurassic Park in 1993 and from the second the movie started I was at the edge of my seat. From the breathtaking and groundbreaking visuals, to the outstanding cast, and the magnificent score everything about Jurassic Park made me fall in love with it. The dinosaurs had come to life before my very eyes, and Spielberg masterfully wrote a thrilling script that had me sweating for two full hours. I can never forget the thrills I felt during the T-rex scene and that final climax with the velociraptors in the museum's kitchen. I remember thinking there was no one cooler than Sam Neill's Alan Grant and I wanted to be Tim Murphy (played brilliantly by Joseph Mazzello). The rest of the cast was also amazing: Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Ariana Richards, Bob Peck, and Samuel L. Jackson. Many will consider Jaws as Steven Spielberg's most terrifying film, but for me it was Jurassic Park because I got to experience it on the big screen and it was my first memorable experience at a theater. I had seen many other films that had made an impact on me prior to this (Star Wars, The Goonies, Raiders of the Lost Arc, and E.T.) but none in a theater, so Jurassic Park holds that nostalgic value and it will forever remain one of my favorite films. It also became the first film I went to see again at a theater because I couldn't get enough of this world. There are so many quotable lines from this movie and many memorable scenes, and I realize it is going to be impossible for Jurassic World to live up to that standard but I am still highly anticipating it while I relive some of my childhood memories with Jurassic Park. It's a masterpiece."
"The focus of Steven Spielberg's ground-breaking thrill-ride Jurassic Park, is a wondrous island theme park off the coast of Costa Rica populated by genetically engineered dinosaurs, masterminded by billionaire visionary John Hammond (a superlative Richard Attenborough), ready for business as soon as a handful of experts can declare it legally and naturally safe for paying customers. Soon we see a group of scientists head to Isla Nublar including paleontologist Alan Grant (Sam Neill), his paleobotanist colleague Ellie Satler (Laura Dern), and mathematician Ian Malcolm (a fast- talking, vintage Jeff Goldblum), a chaos theorist who recognizes that knowledge without discipline equals disaster. Of course he's right, and the park's maiden tour turns into a nightmare for the visitors, who include Hammond's two precocious grandchildren. Compounding this mayhem is the park's systems-control expert, who plots to sell dinosaur DNA to a rival corporation, and must sabotage park security to carry out his scheme. When a tropical storm threatens the island, our unscrupulous employee seizes the opportunity, leaving the billion-dollar attractions to roam free, as all hell breaks loose. What ensues is special-effects nirvana!Jurassic Park is an astonishing success in one sense and one sense only: It is the monster of all monster movies, guaranteed to challenge weak bladders and flutter heartbeats with its astounding full-size live-action mechanics and computer-generated imagery. But more than anything, it is Spielberg's pop culture wizardry that sells Jurassic Park. He retains a child-like glee in making us jump while giving flesh and blood characters the fright of their lives, with every mind-boggling moment of wonder and terror - from the gentle gracefulness of a gigantic Brachiosaurus walking across a green pasture to the horrifying attack of a T-Rex during a rainstorm to the first appearance of the dreaded Velociraptors. Spielberg orchestrates the action with effortless verve and, only the most Scrooge-like viewer will fail to be transfixed by the thrilling action and the sheer scale of the director's vision. T-Rex and his chums are indisputably the stars here but Jurassic Park is still a very character-driven movie, and part of what makes the film so successful is Spielberg's insistence that the dinosaurs may overrun the park, but never the film. Every character has something to do, and they are the focus of every scene with all actors pitching in commendable performances.Jurassic Park exists now as one of the pinnacles of popcorn cinema - a terrific thrill ride that is more than just the sum of its special effects. It may be easy to look at Jurassic Park as of a bygone era, but no rose-colored glasses or nostalgic impulses are needed to remain in astonishment at what Spielberg was able to create. It remains as potent an entertainment as ever - a watershed moment in cinematic history!"
"Steven Spielberg has always been at his best with blockbusters. Although he is a master storyteller and a peerless technician, his serious movies, while always worth watching, can undermine their pathos with an excess of sentimentalism (""James, earn this!"", ""Give us free!"", ""I could have saved more!"") and an array of weak endings (Minority Report, AI, War of the Worlds...).However, Spielberg's childlike glee and exuberance serve him well in more lighthearted fare (although the horrendous Kingdom of the Crystal Skull really gave me pause). NOBODY could craft an exciting action set-piece as well as pre-2000s Spielberg: his best efforts (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark...) remain unparalleled in escapist cinema.Jurassic Park, smartly adapted from Michael Crichton's novel (is there a better premise in modern science fiction?), is one of Spielberg's triumphs. Performances are tone-perfect; Jeff Goldblum's witty Malcolm is a crowd-pleaser, but my favorite character remains Sam Neill's Alan Grant, whose evolution from sour child-hater to caring protector gives the movie some much needed humanity lacking in the sequels - see Jurassic World and Chris Pratt's tediously infallible action figure.John Williams' soundtrack is phenomenal, conveying both awe and terror, excitement and sweetness - one of the composer's best works.The attention to the smallest detail is palpable. See how chaos expert Malcolm and benevolent ""creator"" Hammond (Attenborough) are clad respectively in black and white, symbolizing disorder and order, yin and yang. It's a small touch, but few other blockbusters bother with this kind of things.And those special effects... with a few irrelevant exceptions, it's mind-boggling how well they have aged. With their blend of practical effects and computer graphics, they still look amazing after twenty years (they have a WEIGHT, a physical presence), while today most special effects-heavy films are instantly dated, a garish slideshow of vaporous CGI.Still, the main star here is Spielberg. Scenes like the T-Rex breakout, the jeep chase or the hide and seek with the Raptors have earned their place in the collective memory of action cinema. Followed by four mostly worthless sequels.10/10"
"From the creative and futurist mind of Michael Crichton comes this incredible and terrifying movie called "" Jurassic Park. "" Yet it took two exceptional directors, Steven Spielberg and George Lucus, to bring this imaginative story to life. The movie concerns an eccentric Billionaire named John Hammond, ( Richard Attenborough) who decides to buy an island off the coast of Costa Rico and build a huge enclosure for recreated Dinosaurs. When it's finished he invites the foremost authorities to endorse his park which include Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), a Palo-botanist, Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) a Chaos Theorist. The Zoo which Hammond creates for his attractions is a gigantic and impressive enclosure surrounded by electrified fences, automatic controls and computer protected alarms. So safe is the public that Hammond also invites his grand children. (Tim Murphy and Ariana Richards) However, no sooner does the grand opening tour begins, when things begin to malfunction. This sabotage is programed by one of the employees who is set to make a fortune by betraying his employer. The animals getting free is bad enough, but the terrifying ordeal has just begun, when the worst of the dinosaurs, the T-Rex is also set free. Horror gives way to terror when the children are preyed upon in the jungle tour, but they also have to race about in the open park, with all sorts of hungry creatures awaiting them. The movie is filled with frightening and terrifying scenes and only the screams of the audience is left within the walls of the theater. Samuel L. Jackson, BD Wong and Wayne Knight add credibility of this film which because of the Special Effects and enhanced modern CGI make's it a Classic for everyone. Easily recommend to all audiences. ****"
"Steven Spielberg's phenomenally successful sci-fi adventure thriller is graced by state-of-the-art special effects from the team of Stan Winston, Phil Tippett and Michael Lantieri from George Lucas's Industrial Light & Magic in this movie,Jurassic Park.It is based on the novel of the same title by Michael Crichton and it stars Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Ariana Richards, Joseph Mazzello, Martin Ferrero and Bob Peck. The story centers on the fictional Isla Nublar near Costa Rica in the Central American Pacific Coast, where a billionaire philanthropist and a small team of genetic scientists have created an amusement park of cloned dinosaurs.The screenplay follows Dr. Alan Grant and Dr. Ellie Sattler,two dinosaur experts as they are invited by eccentric millionaire John Hammond to preview his new amusement park on an island off Costa Rica. By cloning DNA harvested from pre-historic insects, Hammond has been able to create living dinosaurs for his new Jurassic Park, an immense animal preserve housing real brachiosaurs, dilophosaurs, triceratops, velociraptors, and a Tyrannosaur Rex. Accompanied by cynical scientist Ian Malcolm, who is obsessed with chaos theory, and Hammond's two grandchildren, they are sent on a tour through Hammond's new resort in computer controlled touring cars. But as a tropical storm hits the island, knocking out the power supply, and an unscrupulous employee sabotages the system so that he can smuggle dinosaur embryos out of the park, the dinosaurs start to rage out of control. Grant then has to bring Hammond's grandchildren back to safety as the group is pursued by the gigantic man-eating beasts.Jurassic Park remains an incredible viewing experience and it never ceases to be entertaining. It's not an entirely faithful adaptation of Michael Crichton's popular novel, but the creative liberties it takes prove enormously ingenious.There is a lot of good things to say about it like the performances are top notch, the score is brilliant, and the special effects still hold up at present times in what is easily one of Steven Spielberg's best sequences of sustained awe and sheer terror since Jaws."
"Plot:Just a quick note, the book and film are almost nothing alike. But it doesn't matter! This movie is a masterpiece! Dinosaurs are brought back by using DNA found fossilized THAT is used to create Dinosaurs. Much like with the modern film Avatar, it's not so much about the plot, it's about the experience of being in this world.Characters:Jeff Goldblum is the star. He's the only one in the movie who has a brain or common sense. In fact, some, if not all, famous lines from this movie come from this character. Ian Malcom is a scientist (Rockstar according to John Hammond) and is the ONLY one who finds this whole phenomenon to be a mistake and a giant spit in the face of god and nature.Visuals:The dinosaurs and visuals are groundbreaking. It's the first time CGI was used extensively to create full objects that interact with the natural objects or characters. Animatronics are still used, courtesy of Stan Winston studios, and are incredi-amazing. Ah-Ah-Amazing...Sound:The musical score from John Williams steals the show. Even without seeing the visuals, just hearing the music sends me back to this world.Enjoyment:They really should remake Jurassic Park instead of making of fourth movie. Why make ANOTHER?!"
"By now there are nearly a thousand (not really a bazillion) reviews for this Steven Spielberg film. So, in the case of mega-hits where there is a strong consensus that the movie is exceptional (and I don't disagree), what more is there to say?! Apart from a few characters who seemed a bit one-dimensional (which is a minor problem in an action film) and the unwritten Spielberg rule that kids cannot die (taking away much of the suspense), the film is amazing. While the CGI isn't quite as beautiful as what we can do today, it STILL looks awesome. With only a few exceptions, the dinosaurs LOOK real! And, the music from John Williams is, as expected, very good. Overall, a highly entertaining film which will no doubt please everyone except for the impossible to please."
"Steven Spielberg is one of the greatest directors of all time and is the king of Hollywood blockbusters and this is one of his greatest movies. What I love about Spielberg is how he's always thinking outside the box and doing things nobody else has and in result he had made one ground breaking movie after another making other similarly themed films look absolute in comparison. I mean only Spielberg would have the for-site to license the Jurrassic Park book by Micheal Crichton even before he finished writing it and long before it was released because he saw the movie potential. Before I get to the Dinosaurs let me talk about everything else. First I must praise Micheal Crichton for his brilliant concept. The story gives a plausible(granted not realistic) explanation to how people could resurrect Dinosaurs. The movie starts off strong as in a classic horror movie fashion we get a glimpse of a dinosaur, a Velociraptor attacks a human but we never see the Raptor it self. With a movie like this you expect the first fifteen minutes or so to be exposition and set-up and you expect that we have to wait awhile until we some Dinosaours. Well, all that's true but it's not a problem because Spielberg keeps the pace moving so nicely, it's never boring or slow. Spielberg just gives enough exposition that he needs to give, a old billionaire named John Hammond has a park with real life Dinosaurs and to please a lawyer who represents his sponsors he persuades two archaeologist and a scientist to come along to check it out and give their approval and our story begins. As great as the special effects are you need a great story and great human characters. The story is simple but well done, it makes a ludicrous premise of Dinosaurs being brought back from the dead into 1993 believable and that's because the movie takes it self seriously it's never comes off campy or ironic. The story is similar to Frankenstein as they show what happens when ""man"" play God. I like all the characters here. Richard Attenburrough is perfect as John, the old man who created the amusement park. I like that they never make him a bad guy or even crazy just misguided and you even feel bad for him when his amusement park dosen't go the way he hoped. The more or less hero of the story is Alan Grant played by Sam Neil, an up-tight archaeologist who dosen't like kids but later does after protecting John's grandkids from Dinosaurs, nothing really deep but a good fit for this story. In fact none of the characters are really deep but still strong characters capable of holding this movie. I like Laura Dern as Ellie, Alan's partner who's tough and fearless. Wayne Knight gives a memorable performance as the double crossing Dennis, who is the only true villain. Samuel L. Jackson is also good as one of the guys who operate the park. My favorite character might be Dr. Ian Malcolm played by Jeff Goldblum. I like how John described him as a ""rock star"" with his shades and leather jacket. It's hard to explain but Jeff is just so appealing and he brings some humor to the movie. I also really like Bob Peck as the expert hunter Rob Muldon, he's like the Van Henlson to Dinosaurs. I like his rivalry with Raptors and I feel bad when he's killed by one of them, I wish he would of came back for a sequel. But the best thing are the dinosaurs themselves. The special effects are amazing, especially for 1993. The Dinosaurs look real and I don't mean real looking for a movie I mean they look like their really alive. Nothing mechanical or cgi looking about them. The special effects are groundbreaking and some of the best in movie history. First we see the Brachiosaurs, which looks great as well as seeing a Triceatops which looked all too real. but the real moment comes when we see the most iconic Dinosaur of them all the Trannosaurus Rex, who emerges after the power goes out and Ian, Alan and the kids are stuck in a car in front of the T-Rex cage and it attacks the kids in the car. The special effects on the T-Rex looks frighteningly real and I love it's roar. Later the T-Rex chases Ellie, Rob, and Ian in a car which was also great. I also love the Dilophosaurs who attacks Dennis, I love how it's like a rattle snake but unfortunately the real Dinosaur dosen't have the neck fan or shot venom, that was created by Crichton but this is way better. The best Dinosaurs are the Velociraptors, no one even heard of them until this movie. That's one of the great things about this movie is that they introduced us to some lesser known Dinos. I understand for theatrics Spielberg had to make the Raptors more menacing then they really were but he did a great job at making the Dinosaurs be animals acting by instant not monsters. I love how intelligent they made the Raptors. The Raptors are my favorite Dinosaurs in this movie and they steal the show. Although the ending was a little contrived when the T-Rex came out of no where to save ""our heroes"" from three Raptors, two of which some how escaped a locked room but it made for a good climax any way. I also love the score by the great John Williams. The is def-intently the greatest Dinosaur movie of all time."
"I don't really like paying for movie tickets just to watch old movies converted into 3D. I can watch the 2D version at home, with no cost. Still, Jurassic Park is one of those movies. No matter, if you watch it in 3D or 2D, your jaw will dropped seeing the realistic lifelike dinosaurs on screen. I had watch this movie over and over again over the years, and it always is a blast to watch. In my opinion, it's one of the best movies of the 1990's. Jurassic Park is the story of a theme park on a tropical island near Costa Rica, populated with cloned dinosaurs that turn amok, and those left on the island, must find a way to escape. Jurassic Park shows the potential danger of technology. Owner John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) spared no expense making this park, but in an attempt to increase efficiency and save money, wants Jurassic Park to be able to operate with a minimal number of staff run by weasel Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) and Ray Arnold (Samuel L. Jackson). Therefore, he has the park designed to be operated almost entirely by a huge computer system that automates virtually all of the park's systems and functions. What he doesn't know is that Dennis Nedry, has been paid off by one of InGen's corporate rivals to steal dinosaur embryos. During the theft, Nedry deactivates the park's security system to allow him access to the embryo storage room. Jurassic Park was written by Michael Crichton in 1990, the beginning of the information age, where everything was getting computerizing, but few knew the dangers of it. People are still suffering from computer theft even today. Another danger of technology is how men shouldn't play God by cloning extinct animals. The movie mirrors the lesson teach in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Still the science in the film might be far-fetch. The idea of bringing dinosaurs to life after 65 million years is unlikely even with future technology. Soft tissues that contain DNA are nearly impossible to preserve and the chances of extracting enough DNA of a single dinosaur to produce one are slim. Still, it's interesting. If it does happen, you know that chaos will come close in hand. This serves as an example, where technology fails to keep us save, and prove disastrous. Still the movie fails to explain why Hammond didn't use all the staff that he has. They were paid to be there, so when the hurricane comes to the island. Surprising the film footage of the storm was Hurricane Iniki that hit Hawaii where they were filming. So that was really a hurricane that being shown there. Anyways it would make sense to have the staff there to make sure the island is secure, but he send them off the island for something that was a merely a small storm, keeping only two computer guys and a game hunter? What? The movie would be a little bit more interesting if only we, the audience got to see the whole staff in danger as well, like Michael Crichton earlier novel, 'Westworld' that has a similar plot. Instead we only see a small group of dinosaur experts try to escape the island rather than a whole island in chaos. This small group is leaded by paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern). Harrison Ford was first ask, but he turned down the role of Dr. Alan Grant as people might mistake the character for Indiana Jones. In my opinion, Sam Neill was perfect for the role. They are joined by Hammond's grandchildren, Lex (Ariana Richards) and Tim Murphy (Joseph Mazzello). The kids are bit annoying as they do idiotic stuff or have stupid dialogue. Most of the movie, I really wanted them to get eaten by a dinosaur. It make sense for all those characters to be in the island, except Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), a mathematician that the lawyer brought in. While Jeff Goldblum is given some of the best lines in the film; the reason why his character is there is still a question to me. He doesn't know anything about dinosaurs. Still, I do like his flirting with Chaos Theory. The movie differs from the book in a bit. I'm glad Steven Spielberg took out the Hupia theme from the story. It wasn't needed. Different characters end up dying, while other characters that supposedly died in the book, live in the film version. Surprising the whole character of Tina was written out of the film. The film has amazing visual and special effects by the use of animatronics. The film is noted as one of the first movies to use CGI. Director Steven Spielberg was worried that computer graphics might look like 8 bit type cartoon quality but upon seeing ILM's demo animation of dinosaurs. He decided to shoot nearly all the dinosaur scenes using this method. In my opinion, the stop motion they did film wasn't too bad as well. The early CGI, this film use is surprising is better than a lot of modern day CGI that low budget companies use. Jurassic Park's soundtrack compost by John Williams is truly anthem of our childhood. The music is spectacular. Not a lot of people know this, but while Steven Spielberg work on Schindler's List, he placed post-production in the hands of George Lucas. In many ways, you can see Luca's influence in the film. It was while supervising post-production on this film that George Lucas decided that technology was good enough to begin work on the Star Wars prequels. The movie is a must- see movie, not only if you love dinosaurs, but also if you love Sci-Fiction. Give it a try if you haven't saw it already. An adventure 65 million years in the making is waiting for you."
"I am a 20-year old girl living in Romania, a country God completely forgot about. Growing up, I enjoyed adventure and fantasy movies or stories more than anything, they gave me a sense of hope, great comfort and made me wonder about the world.""Jurassic Park"" gave children of my age the biggest joy of our lives, years after the movie came out we would still be talking about dinosaurs! I remember a little girl who drew dinosaurs on the street, wishing they were real and she could see one. Her kind of hope still brings tears to my eyes.""Jurassic Park"" is more than just a movie, it's a magic adventure my generation will never forget. Thank you Steven Spielberg! When I grow up I want to be just like you!"
"Jurassic Park is the main reason I became a dinosaur fan. When I first saw this movie when I was about 3 or 4 I watched it mainly for the dinosaurs, which I still do but after watching it when I'm a lot older I started to not just love the dinosaurs but the IDEA of a theme park zoo filled with dinosaurs! I also think the story is amazing. I don't see how anyone could hate this film or give it a 1 out of 10. Also as you may know, Dr. Grants character is based on the famous paleontologist Jack Horner. Who as we speak is working on reverse engineering a chicken to give is teeth, tail, and change its wings to claws. This is just one of the many reasons I am interested so much in JP. It has inspired people and has been inspired by people. 10/10"
"I like many saw this as a kid and was so super enthralled. the movie was fun, scary and at times LAUGH OUT LOUD funny. people who only watch this for the special effects must pay attention to the dialog and story. its actually very deep and raises certain questions rely questioned in movies today. this movie for some reason people skip over the acting, but cm on! its got some of the best actors here doing probably there best work. who can forget Jeff goldblum as Ian Malcolm?? this guy was hilarious, almost every bit of dialog he said was brilliantly funny and just his whole unique idiosyncratic personality added so much to the film. no wonder he was cast again in ""the lost world"", although he was sadly less funny in that one. then you got Sam Niel as Alan grant, again, brilliant actor who fit his role perfectly and you really believed he was this smart scientist dinosaur guy. he was very down to earth and a very caring rugged type of guy, and also very likable in the main role. laura dern is perhaps the weak spot, at times she kinda annoyed me but yet at the same time, she was very real and her and Sam Neil had great chemistry. however i don't like what they did to them in JP3, it contradicts the ending of JP1, but ah well, i tend to just ignore JP3 ever happened. the kid actors are actually very good, the boy was so cute and funny always following grant around and being the comedy relief, and the girl wasn't bad either. its surprising actually, 2 kid actors that didn't annoy me! how refreshing! and even the small roles like with the fat guy dennis and the small role of samuel l jackson as the computer guy and of course the badass muldoon ""SHOOT HEEER!"" were actually really great acting and often times very funny! anyway, almost 20 years later i still remain impressed and this is a film that is not to be missed, and if i ever have kids i look forward to sharing this film with them, thats how much i love this movie!"
"Jurassic Park is one of Spielberg's best movies. i was so awed by this movie when I first saw it. Everything is just about amazing regarding this film. The story is about a dinosaur park off the coast of Costa Rica. There were rumors that the park was in serious trouble, so the owner John Hammond decides to get a dinosaur expert, paleobotanist, a scientist, a lawyer, and his grandchildren to endorse the park. Unfortunately, the dinosaurs are free from their domains after the power went out. Now everybody must have their survival instincts in hand. The acting is very good. I Liked Sam Neill as Alan Grant. The special effects were amazing. The dinosaurs are pretty darn perfect. The sound effects are excellent as well. I really loved the music in this film. John Williams did such a fantastic job with this score and themes. Overall, this is must-see movie. I rate this movie 10/10."
"First chapter from trilogy that gives exciting , sweeping fun and entertainment provided by giant animals made by means of incredible combination of computer generator -ILM, Industrial Light Magic- and Animatronics models . This original ideal is based on Michael Crichton's novel and writing credits by David Koepp . The picture starts on Isla Nublar, a small island 120 miles off the coast of Costa Rica , a group of construction workers and animal handlers offload a large container, the creature within unseen. During the process, the animal tries to escape, an act which leads to a mass panic , and the death of one of the workers . The island in property the billionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) ; as Jurassic Park's owner brings to various paleontologists (Sam Neill , Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum) to the island of Costa Rica hoping to convince them for an incredible adventure and where Dinos were allowed mix freely and to breed . There are living dinosaurs and various prehistoric creatures genetically engineered by means of DNA cloned extracted from Jurassic animals found in mosquitoes preserved into amber from cretaceous period . During a preview tour , Nedry (Wayne Knight) disables the security system so that he can make his escape with some stolen embryos , this enables all the dinosaurs to escape their enclosures . Then , the theme park suffers a major power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur exhibits to run amok against the paleontologists and the curator's grandsons (Joseph Mazzelo , Ariana Richards) .This is an enjoyable first entry , plenty of spine-tingler thrills , chills , emotion and lots of fun . The Dinosaurs are the real protagonists , they're terrifyingly awesome and almost completely convincing. Simple dialog and plain tale , but the story is very exciting and inventive . In the film appears numerous predator animals and colossal carnivores as Tyrannosaurus Rex , Velociraptors, Behemoths , Spinosaurious , Stegosauruses although most of creatures are large herbivores harmless and feed on vegetables as large dinosaurs , triceratops and Brachiosaurius accompanied by a herd of Parasaurolophus . Humans try desperately to escape of dinosaurs and they are chased through leafy jungle by fanged giant animals , specially by the Tyrannosaurus and of course by attack of the Velociraptors . In fact the prehistoric animals are truly the film stars , they are terrifyingly awful and create abundant and quite potent screams and scares . There're some stirring and exciting scenes dealing a van dangling over a cliff and Tyrannosaurius pushing while the starring are seized in a cord where the actors give vigorous physical performances . The biggest interpretations are by Sam Neill as a nice , resourceful paleontologist , Jeff Goldblum as a likable mathematician and Wayne Knight as greedy man with mean purports . Magnificent especial effects totally convincing are for combination of models in charge of Stan Winston Studio and computer animation from Phil Tippet , Dennis Muren along with Industrial , Light and Magic of George Lucas . As always spectacular music by John Williams and excellent cinematography by Dean Cundey , both of whom are Spielberg's habituals . The motion picture was stunningly directed by Steven Spielberg , plus including his typical touches . Rating : Above average , well worth watching . It's followed by ¨Lost world¨ directed again by Spielberg and Jurassik Park III by Joe Johnston . The film will appeal to teenagers and and growns-up , but no for small kids by violent, realistic and gory attacks by monsters animals."
"I watched this movie when I was kid. I went to take the form for entrance exam for my 9th grade, and while I was returning home I saw that Jurassic Park is being shown in a Cinema Hall. And I had seen some of the promos on star TV of that time, and discussed with some friends and relatives that this could be a good movie. So I went to see the movie at the age of 13. I saw the film and enjoyed the scariness a lot. Then after that several times whole school with teachers went to see the film and whole family went to see the film. And remained in my memory as an unforgettable event. Now whenever I see this film on my DVD with a lot of clarity and surround sound it still gives me the same enjoyment and thrill as it gave me when for the first time I saw it. This movie Jurassic Park is marvelous and I love it and I love it a lot. I do not want to say anything more, just I love it."
"One of the very first things we learn during the credits after ""Jurassic Park"" is that it is based on a novel by Michael Crichton, and that the screenplay was written by Michael Crichton with the help of David Koepp. It's for the best that he decided to pen his first screenplay since 1978's ""Coma"" when ""Jurassic Park"" went into development because it's hard to imagine a screenplay based on his dark sci-fi horror novel being successful in the same way this screenplay was. Crichton, writing a screenplay based on his own work, opted to change the tone and much of the plot for this Hollywood production. Rather than the dark sci-fi the novel is, ""Jurassic Park"" the movie is a fun, relatively light-hearted action adventure, and the decision to change the tone might go down in history as one of the smartest screen writing decisions in history.This is simply an exceptional film. Technically, it is an astounding achievement. As of 2007, fourteen years after ""Jurassic Park"" was released, its special affects are still excellent compared to many mainstream films. Steven Spielberg did no wrong with this film; you can't really criticize anything about it. The public likes Michael Bay because he blows up a lot of expensive stuff and films the explosions, but if one was to list the flaws in one Michael Bay film they could fill dozens of pages. But really, what's wrong with ""Jurassic Park""? The answer is: nothing. You can't fault the gorgeous cinematography, as there are more greatshots in this film than all the summer blockbusters of recent years put together and you certainly can't fault John Williams' classic score. So where does the criticism come from? Some think ""Jurassic Park"" could've been darker and dealt more with its central theme- don't mess with nature. Some think ""Jurassic Park"" doesn't build suspense for long enough, and shows the dinosaurs too often. This claims are without basis because ""Jurassic Park"" never claimed to be a deep film with heavy subtext (there is subtext, but it is dealt with only superficially), nor did it want to be ""Jaws"" (more like ""Indiana Jones"" with dinosaurs). One thing that has to be understood is that this is an action adventure. It eliminates the majority of the science and techno-babble from Crichton's novel, condensing it to a few minutes near the start of the film. The cast is memorable, in particular Sam Neill as Alan Grant, who really reminds me of Indiana Jones in a sense. The character is adventurous, smart, and funny and I really can't imagine anyone else playing him quite as well as Sam Neill did. Laura Dern, an exceptional actress who should've won awards for certain performances in certain David Lynch films, is good here as are Jeff Goldblum and Richard Attenborough. The child actors could've been more annoying, which when speaking of child actors in general is a compliment.There are few films in existence as exciting as ""Jurassic Park"", and there are very, very few, if any at all, summer blockbusters as perfectly-made and memorable as this. If you're looking for intriguing science fiction dealing with intricate themes, this is not the place for it. There is depth to ""Jurassic Park"", but for meditative science fiction there are certainly better options. Watch this if you want to be entertained, or just to see an example of utterly phenomenal film-making.****/4"
"Everyone knows what happens in ""Jurassic Park"", so I'll just talk about a few aspects. I think that it's fitting that the movie was released in 1993. With baby boomer Bill Clinton now in the White House, it was clearly a new era, and this movie looked like it was representing a new era - think of it as being 1961, with young John Kennedy as the new president (which it would have been for my parents)*. The fact that Steven Spielberg also released ""Schindler's List"" that year and won two Oscars for it backs up this aspect.Unfortunately, ""The Lost World"" was beyond pathetic. It was just a repeat of the first one and was totally predictable. So avoid that one and stick with this one. I never saw ""Jurassic Park III"". While in Maui during spring break, 2003, I went on a helicopter ride and we flew over the area where parts of ""Jurassic Park"" were filmed.*As it was, Rob and Laura Petrie on ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" were loosely based on the Kennedys. I don't know of any characters based on the Clintons."
"This has got to be the single most BRILLIANT movie of all time.  I am a long time dinofreak/Pro-Life person, so this is right up my alley.  I ADORE everything about it, and, even though a lot of people say this, I think even the scenes without dinosaurs are great.  They just add to the plot and the suspense.  I don't care what anyone has to say about this movie, because it is my favorite movie of all time, even better than my second favorite, ""The Matrix.""  Enjoy, fellow dino-lovers."
"Jurassic Park is one of the most underrated movies of the 90's. The Special effects were amazing. The CGI surpasses just about anything made today (besides King Kong, Cloverfield etc.). Jurassic Park turned me into a dinosaur fanatic.I liked characters and found them memorable (especially Malcom). The Velociraptors are one of the most sinister villains in any movie I've seen. I would fit them in between the Joker from The Dark Knight and the Emperor from Star wars. This movie is one of the many reasons I love Spielbergs work. The next two films were good but could never quite compare to the original, classic Jurassic Park. In my opinion it beats everything else I've seen."
"This week I've been watching the ""Jurassic Park"" trilogy in preparation for ""Jurassic World"" which hits theaters next weekend. I am ashamed to say that I've gone twenty-two years since this movie came out without ever having seen it. I think that likely had to do with the fact that I've just never been that big into dinosaurs, and so the general theme of the film just didn't appeal to me. Having watched it, I can say that I enjoyed it quite a bit.I'm giving the film an 8/10 stars, albeit with thoughts of giving it just a seven. I decided to go with the eight because I think that if I try to be as objective as possible, the film probably deserves that. It's an extremely well made film about the dangers of science run amok. The dinosaurs at times look a bit awkward, but, hey--it was 1993...animation and CGI effects have come a long way since then. Still, the film has aged relatively well. The story is good overall, and the acting is not half bad, though I would say that it has more of a feel of an 80's popcorn movie than a 90's blockbuster hit. Throughout the film I could see shades of ""The Goonies"" and ""E.T."" in Spielberg's filmmaking style.That said, my relative disinterest in the whole dinosaur vibe still was a bit of a wall toward getting into the film, which is why I say I toyed with the idea of only seven stars. But this movie is definitely fun and engaging, and I would recommend it to just about anyone. If you've never seen it before, you're sure to find yourself catching a scene or two that immediately screams ""classic movie moment"", and it's a great movie to just enjoy with the family for an evening of escapism from the real world."
"Jurassic Park is one of my all time favorite films, it is a masterpiece and a landmark in film history. For anyone unfamiliar with the story, the Steven Spielberg adaptation of the Michael Crichton novel is about a rich entrepreneur named John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) who has designed and built the world's first amusement park with live dinosaurs. Hammond needs specialists to sign off on the park before the insurance company will allow him to open for business so he enlists Dr. Grant (Sam Neill), Dr. Sattler (Laura Dern), and Dr. Malcom (Jeff Goldblum) to take the ride through Jurassic Park, along with us. Of course after the ride begins things start to go wrong, due to sabotage, and chaos ensues as the dinosaurs take over the park.The movie is a fast paced, suspenseful, and well done, in the tradition of ""Jaws"", not an exact reference of the source material but the version that was meant to be. The effects are still astounding and the movie still works 20 years later. The film's 20th anniversary 3-D convert is excellent. It has a lot of depth and the movie lends itself well to the added dimension. The movie was ""sweetened"" for the 3-D release, adding just some environmental elements for 3-D and the soundtrack was also tweaked to engulf the audience more.The only new extra is a short featurette on the conversion of the film, that is also in 3-D, nice touch. The original blu-ray from the box set and a DVD is also included in the 3-D combo-pack. The extras on the blu-ray are a very good combination of older extras and a new documentary, which has counter parts on the sequels in the box set (or separate releases that are now available).The only changes are environmental objects for stereo- viewing, and the soundtrack has also been enhanced to engulf the audience. No there has been no real ""changes"" made, so no need to get upset that it is really more than what it is, a 3-D version of the classic film.Well worth the upgrade, though I now have more copies of ""Jurassic Park"" than I can countyou want one???"
"Growing up, Ray Harryhausen was my movie hero - he specialised in putting on screen things which didn't exist. For the last 35 years his place has been taken by Stephen Spielberg, simply because he makes such very, very good films. And he has been known to put something impossible on screen every now and then, too.To synopsise, a theme park is set up on an island, populated by dinosaurs reconstructed from prehistoric DNA extracted from mosquitoes preserved in amber. During the ""test drive"" of the park, attended by palaeontologists, things go horribly wrong...Michael Crichton's book, though very enjoyable, is filled to overflowing with technobabble, particularly with regard to the park's computer system. And, if one is brutally honest, it recycles the basic idea of Crichton's own Westworld some 20 years earlier, albeit different theme park, different victims.Spielberg strips away, simplifies, gives us a range of very human humans as potential (and actual!) victims, and a moderate amount of exposition so that we always believe what happens, and then sets off on the first of a number of spectacular set pieces. The story is minimal and almost incidental.The cast are all good. Jeff Goldblum is not always to my taste, but Sam Neill's sincerity and dignity compensates. But this movie is never about the cast, nor the story.The dinosaurs (and their integration into the movie) are nearly flawless - there are one or two points where the gallimimuses don't convince 100% that they belong against that particular background plate. They vary between mechanical/animatronic effects and CGI - and this is quite near that dawn of CGI for photo-realistic characters wholly integrated into movies - and it was impossible to distinguish which shots are physical and which are photographic. If you don't believe how truly remarkable Jurassic Park's dinosaurs were, particularly for their day, try comparing them with any CGI monster from the SciFi channel's specially commissioned movies nearly 20 years later, and see how unconvincing CGI critters can be, and how woefully they can be integrated into backgrounds (or, indeed, NOT integrated!). They stand up as well now as they did when the movie was first released and, given how far CGI has come since then, that is a testament to their quality.If I had a criticism, it would be that the film is rather too leisurely in dealing with the set up - with the benefit of hindsight, the disastrous events of the second half of the film could have started a little earlier. However, this is more than made up for by John Williams' wonderful score.Addition: April 2013 The recent 3D conversion is quite superb: you would never know that the movie was filmed flat."
"I personally really like Steven Spielberg, and I like his films, especially Schindlers List, Jaws and ET:The Extra Terrestrial. While a tad too long and has one or two loose ends in the plot, Jurassic Park nevertheless has thrilling action and has sheer evidence of the director's vision and effortless verve at work. John Williams's score is absolutely terrific, definitely one of the more memorable scores in a Steven Spielberg movie, the score for Jaws like Psycho is one of the main reason why I am so scared to go into the sea now. The acting is really not bad at all, Sam Neill and Laura Dern have given better performances but they were good. Jeff Goldblum is terrific, and as Dennis Nedry Wayne Knight is suitably more subdued. Richard Attenborough, a talented actor and a even more talented director also is good as John Hammond, while child star Joseph Mazello, who surprised me in Shadowlands is appealing as Tim. However, the real stars are the dinosaurs, especially the T-Rex, the mix of computer animation and models is inspiring. The cinematography is astounding, the script is good and the direction is lively. I haven't read Michael Crichton's book, but regardless this is a hugely enjoyable film. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"Jurassic Park is one of the greatest movies of all times! When the movie was made, I was 7 years old, and until the present days (2005) I think it is a fascinating film,who deserved more then the 3 Oscars won. I love the special effects, who makes all the dinosaurs looks so real and close to us, humans. Sam Neill is so impeccable as professor Alan and Jeff Goldblum is great too. I can say that I started to be more interested about the dinosaurs after this film,reading about some of them in some books and websites. Other thing very important about this movie, is to think about cloning and the consequences behind of it; I mean,one of the news I read those days, was about some scientists that found the corpse of a mammoth in a good state and already think about cloning it. Looks that we need to pay more attention in Jurassic Park's warnings."
"I've seen Jurassic Park probably five or six times, and each time I hope I'll like it better than the last, and I never do. A perfectly wonderful book by Michael Crichton is given the 'Spielberg' treatment and aside from the wonderful special effects, betrayed badly.Where to begin? First and foremost, one of Spielberg's worst tendencies is to find annoying personal characteristics endearing. The two children aren't precocious and charming, they're little brats, no matter how hard the director tries to paint them otherwise. The character of John Hammond, in the book, was as I recall a rather devious, unscrupulous man; here, he is portrayed as a cheerful, slightly ditsy, misguided Santa Claus. And Laura Dern manages to almost single-handedly sink this movie. Her perpetual ""I don't know whether to laugh or cry"" expression is probably the single most irritating element in a film full of them. And everyone smiles WAY too much.Spielberg, for all his supposed genius, also delivers some of the most excruciating action and danger scenes on record. Whenever one of the human characters is in a spot, it is inevitably his or her own stupid fault. They can't lock the door, they won't turn the flashlight off, they're too scared to jump off the fence, they can't run fast enough... every damn scene is like this, to where you want to reach into the screen and slap the hell out of them.Sam Neill comes off best, in what is really a thankless role as the straight man for all this nonsense. But he's dragged down by the same sappy script.Well, what about those special effects, you might ask? Yes, the dinosaurs are spectacular and very believable (much more so than the humans really) and they are the only reason I'm giving this four stars out of ten. In 1993, we were still being blown away by filmmakers constantly upping the ante when it came to mind-blowing effects and sure enough, Jurassic Park was state-of-the-art when it came out. Since then, I daresay people have become more blase about such things as they have become more routine.To be fair, there are some wonderful sequences in Jurassic Park and it's certainly worth seeing at least once. I suppose ultimately that is the most maddening thing about it; it could have been so much better, not just another summer blockbuster, but a truly great motion picture. It's a real shame that it's not."
"Every once in a great while a movie series comes out that's just spectacular...""The Pink Panther;"" the ""Navarone"" movies; ""Harry Potter;"" ""Pirates of the Caribbean;"" ""Lord of the Rings;"" ""Narnia;"" ""Star Wars;"" the ""Bourne"" movies; etc...and, this is one of them! Now, another movie from this 1993 series is coming out in 2015; and, the commercials are great! I cannot wait! There are just no limits to what a kid can evolve into when you give him a camera, as Steven Spielberg's parents did with him.These are awesome movies created by an awesome writer (Michael Crichton) and directed by an awesome director (Steven Spielberg).I love it all! :)"
"I was raised on a diet of dinosaur and monster films, and so when Steven Spielberg gave us Jurassic Park in 1993 promising unbelievably lifelike prehistoric reptiles, I was at the head of the queue (metaphorically speaking of course, since I pre-booked my tickets!!). Needless to say, Steve's amazing big screen version of the Michael Crichton bestseller not only delivered on the promises, making the film a deservedly huge box-office success, but it also redefined special effects for years to come.Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum play three scientists who are invited to a multi-million dollar theme park featuring cloned dinosaurs, which the owner (good old Dickie Attenborough) hopes the trio of boffins will endorse. However, when one disloyal employee sabotages the park's computer system in order to try and steal valuable embryos for a competitor, the guests get to see the exhibits extremely close-up, and must fight for survival against the mighty T-Rex and a pack of intelligent and voracious Velociraptors.The film's plot is a somewhat stripped-down version of the book, and the narrative suffers occasionally for the lack of detail, but with Spielberg at the helm, the result is still a juggernaut of an action film that provides enough thrills, spills and adventure to make it unmissable for fans of creature features. The director manages to pull off some spectacular shots that are amongst the most memorable of his career (such as the simple yet iconic 'water-ripples' as the T-Rex approaches), and with the industry's top FX wizards at his disposal (including ace animatronics expert Stan Winston), he has made a film that still looks amazing a decade and a half later.The best of the trilogy (although part IV is currently in the pipeline, so we shall have to wait and see what happens with that one), Jurassic Park is an excellent piece of cinematic escapism, and way better than anything Spielberg has given us in recent years (I'm still reeling from the latest Indy film and the debacle that was War of the Worlds)."
"The biggest attraction of this film back in 1993, of course, was the realistic computer graphic animation of the dinosaurs by SGI coupled with the realistic sound effects and the good use of suspense built around them both.After I first saw this movie in the theatre 24 years ago, I laid in bed awake for hours, not from fright, but from the lingering excitement of the entire experience. Up to that time, nothing like it had ever been done on that scale. This is hard to remember when, since then, the Discovery Channel came up with the whole ""Walking with ..."" series of documentaries on dinosaurs, early man, and creatures before the dinosaur that use the same techniques that this film did, and thus people have become accustomed to this level of realism in animation both on the small and large screen.Thus with the ""shock value"" of the animation removed, this movie doesn't seem quite as ""5-star"" as it did during its first run. The dialogue, in particular, seems a bit thin now. One aspect of the movie that still impresses me that doesn't get much mention is the outstanding use of sound and sound effects. For example, when the T-Rex first appears in the movie, it is not just the sight of the thing that terrifies, but its tremendous roar. It is still great action adventure viewing for the entire family."
"Science has advanced so far, to the point that scientists are able to clone dinosaurs to populate an island. Turning it into a maximum security theme park seemed to be a good idea, but when human mischief and a breakdown of said security occurs, the result is terrifying.One of the unwritten facts in cinema history is that some folk, no matter what he does, will deride Steven Spielberg's achievements in movie making. Be it popcorn bonanza's such as this dinosaur riot, or the serious, emotionally wrought likes of Schindler's List which was released this same year, Spielberg is not a popular name amongst the arty farty set. Thankfully, those people are in the minority because Spielberg and his movies cater for the mass majority of the honest cash paying movie fan, he is by definition a fan himself, to hear him interviewed and chatter away about cinematic greats such as David Lean is as enlightening as it is as entertaining as his best work.Jurassic Park finds Spielberg directing like a child locked in a sweet shop, all the tools available to him are used with gleeful abandon, the result being one of the most enjoyable sci-fi/fantasy/monster/disaster movies of the 90s. Going on to make a lifetime gross, at the time of writing, of $914,691,118 after being made for just $63 million, I think it's safe to say that Jurassic Park is loved by a lots and lots of people. The charges of the actors being secondary are of course warranted, at times stilted and plain, Laura Dern, Sam Neil, and even Richard Attenborough, possibly do their respective career phone ins; but that's OK in a film of this type, besides, elsewhere Jeff Goldblum rises to the challenge as Ian Malcolm, all quirky and sly, Goldblum gets to look cool and gives the picture it's comedic relief.However, we are ultimately here for the terror, the rampaging dinosaurs expertly assembled at ILM are a pure feast for the eyes, with Spielberg brilliantly creating edge of the seat set piece after set piece. Craftily he lulls us into a false sense of security {aided by screenwriter and novel writer Michael Crichton of course}, it's all lovely, vegetable eating dinosaurs and kiddie friendly fodder. But then, oh then, it's hello T-Rex, Raptors and thrills on the edge of your seats, from that point in it's time to strap yourself in for a magical roller-coaster ride. Thank you Steven Spielberg, Hollywood would be a poorer place without your efforts. 9/10"
"I've always admired Steven Spielberg for his attempts to make different movies. Even though not all of them are exceptional, I've always liked watching them and 'Schindler's List', 'Jurassic Park', 'Saving Private Ryan', 'The Terminal'...just to name a few, rank among my favourites. 'Jurassic Park' is an exciting action adventure. I don't even remember how many times I've seen it but I do recall that I've enjoyed it every single time.The special effects are stunning. The dinosaurs look eerily real. Next to being detailed and well tones, the movement looks very realistic (as in most films one can see the go-motion which Spielberg had cleverly avoided). I wonder why filmmakers today don't use this kind of special effects instead of going entirely CGI. Thanks to the cinematography, the whole park is spectacular to watch and it has just as much an important role as the creatures. The background score and brilliant sound effects manage to create that chilling mood.Another thing that makes 'Jurassic Park' so exciting to watch is the suspense element which is very well built. The viewers wonder who will die next, which dinosaurs will show up, what's the fate of the main characters etc. The opening sequence already gives us the feel that it will be quite a bloodfeast. But, the events that follow thereafter are more 'laidback'. Spielberg starts the story by introducing the park and once the viewer knows all there is to know about the park, the action begins. Though some seem to find the plausibility of the theory about dinosaurs being revived and set to roam the world, problematic, I'd say enjoy it for what it is. It's not supposed to be a philosophical movie with deep meaning (but if someone sees it that way and appreciates it who am I to complain).The cast do a great job. Sam Neill and Laura Derns do a cool job of taking over roles that were offered to the likes of Harrison Ford, William Hurt, Robin Wright Penn, Juliette Binoche and Sridevi. Richard Attenborough always has a pleasant presence even though his character is initially somewhat of a jerk. Jeff Goldblum's charismatic Ian provides some comic relief. Poor Samuel L. Jackson and Bob Peck get devoured but at least they do put up one hell of a battle. Joseph Mazzello is a little annoying but cute and sometimes funny. Ariana Richards screams a lot but otherwise she's adequate.Perhaps it was because of my fascination with dinosaurs that I loved this movie as a child but for me 'Jurassic Park' has stood the test of time. I had just revisited it last night for the nth time and it felt awesome to watch. 1993 was perhaps the best year in Spielbergs career because that's the year he gave 'Schindler's List' and 'Jurassic Park'."
"When I first saw this movie, it was like no other movie I had ever seen. It completely changed my perspective on movies, is one of my favorite films of all time, and most importantly was the gateway to other films (Mainly Spielberg)I think this is one of the greatest movies of all time for many reasons. The plot is spectacular, adding tons of suspense and action to the story. But what I most highly praise about this film is the visual aspects of it. Not just the special effects, but every single frame of it. I just love looking at the props (the tour cars, computers/programs running, the fences & signs, etc), the location, and main sets (The visitor lodge, the lab, the dinosaur paddocks). In my opinion, the most iconic scene in movie history, is when the cars enter the gate and you see the gate close as they enter the park ... It truly makes me say wow. The island setting is breathtaking, the art direction and sets are amazing, but overall, the most amazing aspect are the dinosaurs ... who look incredibly real! The CGI in JP opened up a whole new door for films, yet the effects in JP are even more appealing to the eye than 60% of the CGI in films today. And that's huge for a movie made in '93! And another thing, why I love this movie, is that unlike the other 2 JP movies, this one is set in an island theme park. Everything is new, the dinosaurs are in their paddocks like at the zoo. It's cool, like they're going to a theme park!But what I most enjoy about the movie, are the action sequences. I've seen hundreds of movies, yet my favorite scene of all time is the scene where the Tyrannosaur escapes and attack the cars. It's just so amazing. The rain just adds a certain tone that draws you in, adding tons of tension; And when I see the Rex exit the fence and roar ... I'm blown away! That scene truly is the most thrilling and intense action sequence in movie history. The next scene is when the tour car falls down the tree. Man, that scene is intense, and also one of the best. Another (Well, not quite a scene) scene that's really tense, is when Ian is sitting in the jeep and he sees the footprint's water shake. The music, along with the tremors is really exciting. Lastly, The Raptors in the kitchen is another great scene which can be really suspenseful.Next, the acting ... Which I like. Goldblum is absolutely brilliant as Malcolm, and his acting gives this movie a twist. Neill, the 2 kids, and Attenborough really give this movie a heartwarming feel. And I love Samuel L. Jackson's performance. Also the director is a real strong backbone to this film. Kudos to Spielberg.Another part I truly love about this movie ... aside from the action ... is the look. And what I mean by it, is the setting and the props. I'll explain it. OK, this movie is just so brilliantly shot, with beautiful settings, props, and stages. I'll give some examples. One good example is when you see the visitor lodge for the first time. One of the best looking scenes is when you see the tour cars coming our of the tunnel, and the mountains have mist overhanging them, and then you see the fence in the background ... Brilliantly shot! Another great scene, is when they're waiting in the cars, and Tim takes out the binoculars and looks out the back window. I love that scene! It's just so ""cool looking"". I mean, it pans out and you see the rain running down the window, and the green glow of the binoculars in the dark night. Wow!After you have seen this, you'll want to experience this over and over. I have seen this so many times, I even saw it last night, yet I want to watch it again right now.I know I've gone on and on, and I hope I didn't bore you. It's just I love this film so much.This is truly an amazing film. 10 out of 10 for everything I have listed."
"What a movie! What a fabulous movie! Steven Spielberg does it once again with ""Jurassic Park."" He proves that he can do anything and that dinosaurs weren't monsters, they were animals. It may not be accurate to the book, but it's still a masterpiece.In case you don't know what it's about, it's about the idea of genetically enhanced dinosaurs who are engineered to be harmless, and how a group of scientists are invited to see them and judge them on how safe and how real they are. But, something goes wrong...and that's where the action comes in.One thing that I liked was Jeff Goldblum. He was always my favorite actor. I find him to be a natural actor and the way he delivers his lines is great. It's like he's not even sticking to the script, he's just making it up as he goes along. Also, a beautiful score by John Williams. You can't get better than that."
"Jurrasic Park is one of the best movies I've ever seen. The characters are excellent and show real emotion. The special and visual effects in the movie are amazing. The story stays to it's topic and the way they find the DNA of the Dinosaurs is just brilliant. Steven Speilburg makes this movie, I mean without him I don't think that the movie would of survived without them.The ending of the movie was great too. Which is very important in a movie like this. Not to mention the small things that only a quick eye can catch, like the ""Dinosaurs rule the Earth"" banner in the gift shop.Well, that's my summery of Jurrasic Park and hopefully you'll go out and buy or rent the trilogy. Because, you don't know what your'e missing. -Angsw8"
"Face it: no other film has brought together dinosaurs and man as successfully as 'Jurassic Park' did. That beautiful scene where Grant and Ellie marvel at the magnificent Brachiosaurus while the haunting John Williams score plays is truly breathtaking. And then, of course, is all the other classic scenes with the T-rex attacking the vehicles, the infamous Raptors in the kitchen, and the grand finale.So what if it's not perfect? That's what makes it an even better movie. It can be enjoyable despite its flaws (if any!)."
"Jurassic Park really is 65 million years in the making. I mean, wow. I have never seen a movie that combines action/adventure, intellectuality, in-depth characters, excellent storyline, great graphics, and perhaps one of the best soundtracks ever made (John Williams, of course) in one movie.  How the makers of this movie fit all this really baffles me. What else really amazes me is how close the movie was to the book (especially compared to other books made into movies by Crichton).  Don't let that statement fool you; Jurassic Park the movie is nowhere near the book, but the essential parts have not been ripped out of the book (like all of Crichton's books). Michael Crichton, John Williams, and Steven Spielberg--what an excellent combination!  Crichton wrote the awesome book (and the screenplay for the movie, too, I think), Williams composed and conducted some of the best contemporary/thriller music ever made, and Spielberg made the frightening dinosaurs so much more freaky. The only thing wrong with it was that it wasn't as close to the book as I'd hoped, although, like I said earlier, it maintained the essential parts, which is unusual in Crichton's book-to-movie transformations.  The book explained things a lot better and I could really connect with the book a little better.  I can connect with the movie, too, it's just that I needed to watch it several times before I understood exactly how everything happened the way it did. Watch this movie.  It has hardly any disappointment in it, if any."
"Okay, after writing reviews on The Lost World and JP3, and ranting and raving about just how awfully bad these movies are, especially compared to the prequel, finally I'll tell you just WHAT's so great about this movie. It's got everything. Yes, it has the, at the time spectacular and totally new dinosaur effects- but it also has great dialogue (bits of Malcolm's chaos theory strewn in without getting too scientific for a mainstream cinema audience- if you want the hardcore stuff, read Crichton's book-, Malcolm's sarcastic remarks), an INTERESTING STORY (it's the general idea of man trying control nature which goes wrong, but there are those subplots of Grant and children, Grant and technology, some rivalry between Malcolm and Grant, Hammond's not the greedy, nasty guy from the book [which is why he gets eaten in the book] but just an idealist trying to make his dream come true, and so on...), great music- it's just perfect. I've watched this film over and over and I love it every time. Someone reviewing TLW cleverly remarked that Jurassic Park has its fair share of plot holes too, only nobody seems to criticize them. Jurassic Park does have a fair share of ""flubs"" (there's a whole website dedicated to listing them), starting with the cliff that appears where the Rex paddock should have been, but also equipment seen in the background, crew seen in the background, robotic arms just disappearing, towels that suddenly change color, the emergency bunker directly next to the raptor paddock and so on and so on and so on. But these are not ""plot holes"", they're continuity issues, and sometimes smaller flaws of logic. ""The Lost World"", while I don't know how many of these smaller mistakes it has, already shows how acting, character development, dialogue and especially story move into the background and emphasis is on more dinosaur effects, more intense action scenes and mroe spectacular shots of people getting eaten, accompanied by a hearty ""CRUNCH"" of course. The first time I watched it, just after having seen JP3 I actually liked it, the second time I was more sceptical. There's a lot copied from JP (or Godzilla, or Hatari), and just about everything else is pretty stupid. (Hammond wants to show people dinosaurs for money, so for safety reasons he does this on a remote island with all sorts of security measures. Still, the project fails and the creatures break out and eat people. Now they have the brilliant idea of TAKING DINOSAURS ON THE AMERICAN MAINLAND to show them for money!!) And JP3 is merely a waste of time and money. It's got dinosaur effects and it's got action scenes but it's, if I may quote a newspaper critic, ""nothing but a slasher move, albeit with nonhuman villains"". Some STILL like this, say things like ""Gimme more dinos!"" or ""TLW didn't have enough blood and guts"" but this is what was so great about the first movie. It's got the effects PLUS characters you can identify with (in the sequels you don't give a damn who gets eaten. They could have eaten Goldblum's daughter for all I would have cared) PLUS an exciting storyline PLUS good dialogues PLUS the best soundtrack I've ever heard! But with a franchise like this they just can't help but squeeze money out of it until it's dead..."
"You want great dinosaurs action, well you've got it! Jurassic Park is perhaps the best book to film ever made and one of the best creature features ever made, actually it is the best. Jurassic Park was a one of a kind film in ti's day it had amazing CGI and truly mind blowing automated prosthetic dinosaurs.Jurassic Park stars Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Wayne Knight and Samuel L. Jackson. as a group of people who are invited and who work on an island called Isla Nublar, no one knows what it is and for five years a man named John Hammond has been setting up a sort of biological preserve off the coast of Costa Rica, but this preserve is much different than any other it doesn't house animals it houses dinosaurs, a species of creatures not seen for over 5,000 years. now a group of scientist have the great opportunity to see these amazing creatures before anyone else, but in the blink of an eye this amazing experience turns into a swift rampaging nightmare that unleashes an awesome fury the likes the world has never seen before. Now theses scientist have to out run some of the most deadly predators the world has ever know. Jurassic Park is a high tech pulse racing, mind blowing and eyeball freezing adventure that won't let up till the very end. I very,very highly recommended this amazing film. I hope my thoughts helps~C.R. Lopez 2/4/2009"
"Every once in a while you browse through your movie library and stumble upon a film that takes you back to your childhood and the awe and wonder you experienced for the first time. Jurassic Park is that movie. Never in history has a film portrayed such magnificent creatures from ages past so convincingly and realistically that made you believe they still existed and it is something to witness on a truly epic grand scale. I was very grateful to have the opportunity to see this film with my eyes wide open; absorbing every breathtaking scene, every sense of excitement and adventure, every sense of fright, and every sense of genuine heartfelt movie-magic warmth. With so many memorable moments, this film, even to this day and age, has still stood the test of time and left a permanent stamp on my memory for many years to come and I will forever cherish it and will always hold a special place in my heart."
