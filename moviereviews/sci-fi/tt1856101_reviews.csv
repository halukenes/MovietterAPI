"Blade Runner 2049 is a continuation of 1982's Blade Runner a seemingly impossible task. Against all odds and logic, the movie pulls it off.The Good: The greatest thing about the sequel is simply the story. Without delving into spoiler territory Blade Runner 2049 concludes with an ending that works with an internal logical sense and yet still surprises. There are so many good decisions throughout this production one could hardly list them all. The idea of keeping the cold war and old Iconic brands from the first movie works brilliantly and the overall look and feel of this movie are timeless. Blade Runner 2049 does not try to pigeonhole its narrative into the concerns of today. It does not wink at the fears of today's audience. It is its own self-contained universe telling a story that will work fifty years from now and would have worked just as strongly fifty years ago.The acting is strong across the board with Harrison Ford appearing as if he actually wants to be in the film (and looking fit to boot). Also, Ana de Armas needs to be in every movie moving forward. A truly star-making turn.
The Bad: A combination of a long running time, a leisurely pace and a soundtrack from a health spa can put one in a catatonic state if one is not careful. I confess a strong ending brought me back into the film It was losing me for a while there.In Conclusion: This movie sticks to the ribs after viewing. It seemed even better in retrospect than during the actual viewing (see leisurely pace above). Blade Runner 2049 pulls off effortlessly decisions that could seem disastrous in other films (Jared Leto). In many ways, it is better than the first film and better than it had any right to be. A triumph."
"There are so many tech gadgets, there are so many petty women and hot legs, there is a house wife who arranges a threesome for her man, one can own pets, there is free alcohol and so on and so forth... .... yet this movie is so boring and uninteresting.
wow how can it be? It must be the nature of sequels."
"I have noticed a trend that is choking Hollywood and mainstream film making and I would like to address it. Hollywood is making money now, but slowly and surely the movie watching public is awakening to what is happening and this is going to spell trouble for Hollywood. So, after coming back from Blade Runner this evening I want to make the following points: 1- Not every film needs a sequel 9or prequel or remake or whatever). The first Blade Runner was indeed impressive (if we ignore the happy ending and unicorn of the theatrical release). It was supported by a novel and great acting by the likes of Rutger Hauer and Edward James Olmos. Vangelis' score was peerless and so was the vision of the future. yet, did it beg for a sequel? No, absolutely no. BR 2049 has fantastic, truly superb, CGI, that is large and impressive, but that is all it has going for it.2- Length. Directors have been making films longer and longer. This may be warranted here and there, but let me be honest. I dozed off once for 10-15 minutes. Please stop making these films longer and longer. You are not Kurosawa and this is not Seven Samurai.This is not the worst film of the decade (that award probably goes to The Force Awakens by cover version promoter JJ Abrams just for sheer plagiarism and the studio's lie that it is a sequel while it was a reboot), but other than moments of genius, a good CGI and an underlying important message BR 2049 suffers from too many flaws.Thanks for reading."
"For film fanatics like myself, Blade Runner 2049 is a great film for people to see, regardless if they've witnessed the original or not. On the other hand, if you've never seen the original Blade Runner and are just a casual moviegoer that have thought of the promotion for this film as being an action-packed thrill ride, then I'd have to warn to stay far away from this near three hour motion picture. It's very hard to review this film without getting into specific plot details, but that's exactly what makes this film worth the price of admission alone. For nearly every reason a film fan should be excited about a movie, here is why Blade Runner 2049 is a must see as soon as possible. Before dropping you into this world with Ryan Gosling's character, there is text at the beginning that will fill you in on the history of the events in the past, but even though that information is given to you, your experience just won't be the same without having viewed the first film multiple times and remembering the emotional core of it. Set out on a mission to find something of meaning to the overall story, Ryan Gosling's character (who will remain nameless for the sake of this review) uncovers mysteries and secrets from the past, inevitably involving Rick Deckard. Quite honestly, that's the plot in a nutshell and the specifics of the film will lead to ruining your experience, so let's get technical. If not for anything else, Blade Runner 2049 benefits from some of the best cinematography I've laid my eyes on in years. From the addition of the seamlessly blended visual effects, to the mind- blowing scenery constructed by the entire art department, I have nothing but praise for this film. Whether or not you find yourself enjoying your experience, the visuals alone should have you applauding, due to their incredibly detailed nature. I personally found the overall film to be magnificent, but when certain scenes were dialogue-free and asking you to gasp at the imagery, that's exactly what I was doing, as I feel many audiences members will. Again, without giving anything away, once Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) enters the picture, the way both films sort of interconnect was brilliant in my opinion. It does justice to any loose ends that fans may have wanted in the past, as well as create a new story to gawk at in the process. With a terrifically restrained performance by Ryan Gosling, you'll find yourself sucked into this world as a fly on the wall, as he uncovers these mysteries. With the addition of Harrison Ford giving one of his most sincere and memorable performances, as well as Ana de Armas in a role that really took me by surprise, this film was casted to the nines from beginning to end. Some may complain about Jared Leto and Dave Bautista not being included as much, but I felt as though the served the story quite nicely. In the end, this movie aims to impress Sci-Fi fans across the world, but I feel as though the people who will be looking back on this as a possible classic or at least one of the best sequels ever made, are those who've had the pleasure of indulging in the greatness that is 1982's Blade Runner. I don't say this about films very often, especially when talking about sequels, but I haven't been this immersed in a theatrical experience in quite some time. This is definitely a superior film than the original, it's one of the best films of 2017, and I'll be revisiting it very soon. Blade Runner 2049 is getting a lot of praise and awards consideration from critics and filmgoers across the world, and every bit of it is deserved. Aside from being very long, this is pretty much a perfect film if you don't try to nitpick how it connects and certain questions that aren't blatantly answered. If you know what type of film you're in for, or you've at least seen the original and enjoyed it, I can't recommend this movie enough."
"Executive producer Ridley Scott is British and director Denis Villeneuve and main actor Ryan Gosling are Canadians. It makes zero difference. This is a movie made by hacks with terrible writing.You figure (you hope) that foreigners go to Hollywood and make it better and bring something new to the table. Nope, isn't happening. It proves that these guys are just hacks and the head of the studio is the puppet master. Now I am sure none of these guys are as big a hacks and plagiarists and unoriginal schmucks as Jar jar Abrams, but the arrogance to remake Blade Runner (it needed a sequel like I need my wife to nag some more), the long long long dragging plot and the meaningless and superficial lines had me daydreaming and alternately dozing off.At least there was a beautiful woman in this film and she had legs I could admire. Since there is 100% chance that there will be a sequel to this (Hollywood is an addict) let's make it about her. What? She was deleted. Oh come on, this is Hollywood. She can come back (as a ghost,as a backup copy, her twin sister is in town, etc.)"
"The title says it. Here goes: Prior to release the critiques are overwhelmingly positive and make out the sequel to be the second coming! It turns out there is either payola going on or the studio has photos of some people.The day before and on the day of release IMDb fills up with perfect 'viewer' reviews of said film propelling the sequel to IMDb 250 list. All these, er, reviewers believe this film is perfection with not even a speck of imperfection. 10/10 i.e. nothing at all could be in any way better! The sequel was in actuality unrequested and unwanted.The sequel sets itself up for even more sequels with unresolved or cliff hanger plots.I do have to confess that I found the actresses in 2049 sexy and worth fantasizing about. Those were the real tens here and so I cannot give BR2049 a mere 1, which is something TFA deserves. Obviously Ridley and Villeneuve are better crew than JJ Abrams and whoever Disney hires, but it has to be said that BR2049 was a disappointment and I wish it were not made. The bar was set so high to begin with."
Mainly because I fell asleep. Why is this film so boring? I mean aside from a menage a trois scene where the girlfriends are actually worth looking at everything else not only transpired so slowly it made little sense as well.Why anything on screen is happening boggles the mind. Ask yourself why any of the narrative is of consequence and there is a blank page as an answer. That is saying much in a film that tries to be profound.
"Just slo-mo 'acting' and movements with insider jokes to pretend they are clever.
Could someone point out why this Blade Runner and this blade runner exist? No? Didn't think so.
PS: compare the music with this accounting ledger balance sheet line item with Vangelis' original.
2 stars for the poor and cute dog.Over and out."
"Not only it went against the prequel's story, but also it left the door open for another film. Nothing happens in this after all. All they did is take our money, put us to sleep very likely and tell us to come back and give them more money for the inevitable sequel/franchise/universe/vomit.Here are things hinted at but not resolved: dystopia, army, child birth, successor, corporate corruption and of course lovers' relationship.Don't give it your money. Three stars for the girlfriend's eyes, hair, thighs and home cooking."
"Could the unneeded and dreaded sequel to 1982's Blade Runner be the sequel that finally breaks the camel's back and stops people from feeding the Hollywood sequel machine? It well could be.With the disappointing box office tally despite all the hype and 11/10 payola reviews deployed by obedient critic skin jobs this may finally be the crescendo in the rebellion by audiences that started with rubbish like Ghostbusters 2016, Independence Day Resurgence and other rubbish like Kong 10 (or was that 11?).What is insane, however, is that this inconclusive, no-ending, clichéd film is currently rated higher than its masterpiece prequel. Are people for real or is there payola on IMDb too? BR2049 had no acting, super silly script, stupid lines like ""is your dog real? Why don't you ask it?"" (compare to the context in which this was asked about the owl in the original and the sharp answer from Rachel) and people are cluing in that we should stop helping Hollywood be unoriginal.I know Hollywood has ten silly Star Wars and 6 retarded Marvel films coming out in the next two years, but maybe just maybe BR2049 finally woke up people to support originality instead of stupidity. Sure, I agree that the hologram chick was sexy, but is that enough to go watch a movie that has scavengers throwing an anchor at a flying vehicle and pulling it down while a detective sits inside?I know the rating for this sequel will cool down and end up somewhere in the 7 range, but people need to stop being douches and not attend boring slugs like Star Wars 8,9,10,11, ... 25 and studios need to stop manipulating reviews and ratings and take a hint from the market which really says it all in the context of BR 2049."
"Has this world gone insane? Are you all mad? Is it madness or are your deeds making me feel it is a crazy world? People are blowing each other up, presidents are blatantly lying in people's faces and getting their vote, ministries are making war and being called Ministry Of Defense, companies are polluting the planet and getting richer and on and on and on.Here comes a sequel for a classic of cinema that is currently rated higher than its original. The professional critics dutifully according it superlative reviews is not a surprise. The weekly release of a new Marvel movie gets the usual high reviews from this bunch, which tells me they are on the take. How does one explain the 10/10 perfect reviews on IMDb? Do these reviewers actually believe this is the absolute immaculate and perfect film with nothing in it that could be improved in any way?? I would accept this world as a more sane place if you tell me this is a case of fake shill reviews paid for by the studio (as happened with Star Wars The Force Awakens and others). That I would believe and (sadly) understand. Otherwise, is there someone who really thinks this sequel is better than the original and is perfect?? This film deserves 2/10 for its images and graphics and not much else. The women are eye candies for sure so add another point, but otherwise the inferior music that goes off for no reason, the non-ending that is surely an attempt to set up more sequels and inane dialogue are a shame to the name Blade Runner.Were the makers able to get away with using the name because Philip K Dick has died and cannot stop them?"
"Let me describe the sequence of Blade Runner 2049 for youHere goes:Enter the cinema with an overpriced orange juice that is mandatory because in the last couple of years Hollywood has decided it is artsy and de rigueur to make films longer than 2 hours. The lights dim and commercials kick in for 10 minutes. A game for pre-teens wasting daddy's money on mobile phones and plans kicks in. 2 minutes of endorsements for GM trucks (with some guy whose tone is so macho I roll my eyes) follows. Then there is a reminder to get the right debit card to be hip and in. Then the film follows for a whopping 3 hours almost. You would think that there was a lot happening and we were kept excited. Alas, the only thing that kept me awake was the very periodical appearance of a beautiful eye candy whether real, hologram or laser show version that would keep things exciting.If it were not for the sexy and lovable women Blade Runner 2049 was inane. Yes, inane. Apparently, not every film needs a sequel, a lesson Hollywood didn't learn from Hangover.The script was so corny and the words so elementary one would be excused for thinking this is a practical joke. Head of police, yes head of police is told a big lie by a contractor, head of police believes it and all is good. No double checking, no verifying, no details asked no proof required. it is a matter of life and death for the order of the world and, of OK, let's keep rolling guys. The ending was also a joke. A vehicle is drowning and the hero is being drowned but in the last second kills the bad gal and swims back to the vehicle to mount a rescue (for the sequels that will follow). Replicants can have and make babies, but how? Oh well, watch the prequel Blade Runner Rogue Uno, which is coming out in 2020.At that point all I wanted in life was to buy my own Joi and Luv and go back home."
"My goodness how can you expect an audience to sit through three hours of mind numbing slow-mo contradictory conversations that make no sense and expect people to pay for the privilege.I guess, we should have known better since it is a sequel.All that rescued this film was several hard body, super thin, flaunting babes. Yup, those ashamed of the human body, nature and heterosexuality should stay away too. Otherwise, without the chicks the film would be a complete bust."
"Just a movie to make money for the studio and whoever gets mechanical royalties and Elvis Presley.Otherwise:
Cute and friendly dog. Really sad what happens.Sexxxy chicks galore. Love to get the hooker for a session with my wife.
Harrison Ford is past his prime. How much money is enough, man? Just go lie next to the pool somewhere.
Gosling is cool as usual, but he has nothing to do here. He is just walking around and mumbling.
Someone invent the holographic technology already. The chick was a hard body.Get the DVD and watch the short films. They make more sense than this sequel."
The Force Awakens (2015) + Mr Sandman (the Lullaby 1954) = Blade Runner 2049.To all the reviewers: yeah the babes were cute but that is why it is a 2/10 instead of a 1/10. I still was bored.
"I know better now.These guys have destroyed Blade Runner just to release yet another sequel that should not have been made. Ridley has recently been actively destroying the Alien legacy and releasing subpar non-stories. Villenueve is going from this to yet another unneeded remake, namely Dune.In short, these guys are now in the same league as JJ Abrams, Paul Feig and Michael Bay. That is sad. Blade Runner deserved a better (and lasting) legacy.BR2049 is so long, so boring and so pointless that one really wonders. It boggles the mind that they released an expensive movie that has no point to make and no care to destroy the classicness of Blade Runner.There was a cool headquarters, cool hologram technology and advertising and sexy women. Those deserve points, but what is with the very corny and jaded dialogue? the script was bad and the lines were worse. Compare to the original Blade Runner!People, think twice before attending silly Marvel films, boring Star Wars films and the next 5 Ghostbusters. They are boring and insult your intelligence and their legacy. I am done with these thieving sequels."
"What was the point of this film? It was not entertaining, it was slow and it was sleep-inducing so there must be a plot or morality instead, right? Wrong.
They are retiring peaceful and oppressed replicants while at the same time making even more.
Confused yet?YupLet me give you the reason why they needed this film. Hollywood needs sequels like Donald Trump needs porn stars with STD. Period. It is a disease and addiction for the weak.
PS: I asked my wife if she is into a menage a trois for us and said said no, but I know she was watching with interest so at least this film gave us an opening."
"At least this wasn't anti-woman and anti-female and the women were hot and thin.
They could have easily done a modern film where all the women are in baggy jump suits and obese and expect us to love it but at least they didn't hate on slender and attractive women. That's something these days.Of course it was a sequel and it was stupid and made little sense. I also have to say it is time for Ford to retire."
"The set design is fantastic, the girls are sexxxy and I love dogs. The poor dog!Is it trendy in Hollywood to not employ editors and have the film go on and on and on and on? What's more it is a sequel. More about making money than creating a story."
"I am referring to the thin eye candies. The girlfriend and hooker were positively femininely beautiful and worth the price, but this is not a good movie. Outside the slender and flaunting body of the eye candies it quickly descends to boredom. I just kept rewinding to check out the actresses. Otherwise, zzzz"
"Don't believe the lying shills rating this a ten out of ten. The original Blade Runner is a masterpiece. This film is not. It only deserves a six, but I loved the original so I gave it a seven. My review will compare both films and it contains **spoilers**.First up its pacing. This film is actually much slower than the original, adding up to two hours and forty three minutes of mind numbing boredom. I love slow paced films provided there's enough drama and tension. The first Blade Runner film has long pauses, but its justified. The silence swells toward sudden violence or it occurs because a character is gnawing over a great line of dialog they've just heard or are about to express. So what makes a slow paced film entertaining? The solution is information provided at the right time.The first film immediately tells us that replicants are murderous outlaws. We see one commit murder. Some are hiding here on Earth in Los Angeles and Dekkard is forced to detect and kill them. All that information is given to the audience within the first few minutes. So when Dekkard is wandering through crowded streets of futuristic LA, we the audience are afraid for him, because any one of them could be a murderous replicant. Dear Ridley Scott repeat after me: Information creates tension.This newer film instead begins with long drawn out scenes of dull aimless searching and investigating. Since no villain shows up until the last hour, there's no reason for the hero to actually hurry or feel afraid. When the boring pace finally speeds up toward the end, you're so bored out of your skull, you forgot why anyone is doing anything and you no longer care or even notice what the film thinks is a stunning twist.Those shill reviewers are glowing about its photography. Compared to its budget, the photography is below standard. There are rare nice moments. Seeing the fusion powered spinners (those flying cars) again was nice nostalgia, but far too many albeit pretty shots of -- nothing happening -- rendered the plot all the more irrelevant.Now for the production design. The indoor set designs were poor, telling us very little about the world this film is set in. The ""production value"" looks cheap. I don't mean that in a cheap sleazy film noir way (no that would have been cool), I mean that I don't know where they spent the 185million budget, because only a fraction of that was spent on the sets. Two things did work. The voice comp device has been updated reminiscent of 1984 (the Orwell film starring John Hurt) and there is a Total Recall (the original not the remake) style artificial Female hologram character that is programmed to love K (Ryan Gosling). Interesting, but hardly ground breaking, while the original film was ground breaking in too many ways to mention here. The close up long lens shots in the original made the grimy futuristic streets of Los Angeles really look and feel like a crowded claustrophobic sleazy poverty stricken hellhole. Such a lens also gives size to any character in the foreground making Ford look all the more epic.This film used wider lenses and so the pent up tension of the original street scenes is non existent. In fact very rarely does it venture outside into the streets, so that we cannot breathe in the human polity as easily as we did in the original. The original film had real light emanating from miniature buildings, vehicles and advertising. I'm sorry but computer generated light just doesn't behave like real light does. Real light goes where it wants. The human eye cannot be fooled. Syd Mead is a genius. But looking at this film makes me think he wasn't given the power he needed to bring out this film's potential. It actually looks like some hack is trying to copy him. This makes me feel sad to write that. His work on Elysium (2013) was far superior.And now the acting. Gosling plays it straight (and glum) as he did in the pretty to look at but boring Bangkok crime flick Only God Forgives. There is a plot reason for this, but his dull acting compounds this movie's languid pace. There's not enough of Harrison Ford, who only shows up in the last hour (maybe less?). Jared Leto's monologues are just awful. Its not his fault. He's miscast and badly written.Like Mead, Philip K Dick is a genius too, both films are inspired by his literary masterwork ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"". This film didn't delve deep enough, barely scratching the intellectual surface. Since many of his concepts are incredibly visually rich that just compounds the cinematic failure here. Should you go and see this? If you're a fan of the original, I think you should. The story ends in a way that sets things up for another Blade Runner movie which I hope will actually be entertaining. This film is meant to be a science fiction noir film, but it has little of the intelligence we expect from science fiction and none of the crime solving tension that is required of film noir. It lacked the brutal immediacy of the original nexus 6 villains the first one had in spades. It lacked the tense cat and mouse hunting game that made the original so intense, a race where the lead changed more than once. It just isn't as clever as its, at times pretty visuals and constantly obnoxious soundtrack, pretends it to be.Instead we get a self important bloated fatware art-house snoozefest that is bleak, boring and about as intellectually deep as counterfeit artificial snake skin."
"Blade Runner 2049 is not a good film, but it is not a complete disaster. A story that did not need telling and logically failed, an overlong and slow moving narrative and a massacre that makes no sense any longer were countered by original visuals and beautiful women. I will go with a rating of 4/10.The problems with this film is that it has sequeltitis. They came up with it because they needed to make money from a sequel and have no original ideas.
The massacred are peaceful and are farming. Why do it then? The story moves so slowly that the 3 hours seem like 6. The acting is not good, but moderna ctors cannot touch older ones so that is par for the course. When in the original the performance by the chief of police, his goon, the industrialist and the eye maker would rivet and excite or the strong personality of the replicants would make the blood boil here it is a paint by the number series of appearances.With that said the futuristic society is fun to watch. Even more fun is Ana de Armas, the sexy and delicious hooker and even the legs of the Chief (who is old so has short hair unfortunately). These babes add to the vista and architecture that is most pleasing to the eye in this sequel."
".. and still be this boring?Holy Sweet Jesus! this was boring. 2 Stars for the babes and how thin they were.
That is it.I should remember my plan to not watch sequels."
"Do you know why this is the worst sequel ever (aside from the crappy sequels from Disney)?
Not only it is too over-long and boring it also makes it beautiful prequel become less attractive to the viewers. That is criminal. Sure, the keywords on IMDB point out the chicks are pretty but that is not enough justification for more sequels or remakes.Hollywood, not every film needs a sequel. STOP."
"Blade Runner (1982) was a happy (yet gloomy) accident, involving: a) a young and ambitious director who fought ferociously with studio executives in order for them to let him fulfill his vision; b) a rising blockbuster star who wanted to prove he can also act in a serious movie; c) a crazy Dutch actor who decided to change the script and improvise one of the most memorable monologues in film history; d) a bunch of talented artists who wanted to make a movie that would look and sound different from anything else we had seen before. And most of all, e) a post-Vietnam turbulent era when Hollywood rebels like Coppola, Scorsese and Cimino were audaciously attempting to reinvent the language of cinema, telling stories that mattered and not caring at all about target audiences and marketing trends. As a result, Blade Runner was a box office failure that slowly became a legend, breaking stereotypes like ""good guy kills bad guy at the end"" and dealing with existential agony on an almost metaphysical level; always within the context of a gritty corporate dystopia in the near future.Blade Runner 2049 is none of these things. On the contrary, it's the flawed triumph of a next generation of studio executives, who control the creative process by paying millions to the industry's best of the best, providing they will make something that will take advantage of a successful brand name in order to bring profits to shareholders. If there is one word to describe this movie, it's ""replicant"". Not the kind of replicant who realizes that ""all those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain"" as he dies, but a sleek, expensive and obedient skin-job that will try to entertain you and if it succeeds will return as a sequel that will eventually become yet another franchise. I spent 160 minutes of my life watching a pleasant and perfectly constructed piece of nothing, and I didn't care for a moment about any of the characters or a storyline that was designed without the intention to question and redefine a single thing. All its moments have already been lost in my memory, while the original Blade Runner remains vivid in my mind, as if I only saw it yesterday."
The future is bright! But other than her the film bored me and was sleep inducing. I don't understand the high ranking.
"Being a hardcore Blade Runner and science fiction fanatic, I felt deeply compelled to write this review. I love Ridley Scott's original 1982 Sci-Fi classic. It is my all-time favorite movie. It had mystique and infused my imagination. It was a unique experience; hypnotic & surreal. The sequel, not so much! My initial reaction of BR 2049 was that it's a gorgeous film. I was mesmerized by the striking cinematography and couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I will go as far saying that it's one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. The rich visuals are so glaring it's hard to take it all in and grasp what you are seeing. From the opening shot you know you're in Blade Runner world. The overall look is instantly relatable to the first film and it's an amazing continuation in that regard. Also, the acting was excellent. The entire cast did a great job. However, once I settled into the film I realized that it is mainly a self-indulgent visual feast containing a weak story that lacks clarity & wisdom. There are obvious cliché moments and in certain aspects the story is comical and naive. The movie delves into complex philosophical themes and asks important questions but seldom explores them. It's all over the place. You get the sense that the film is not sure what it wants to be? It's clearly style over substance. Lots of homage is paid to the original through awesome images but the plot is paper-thin with a few subplots & twists added to make it seem intelligent. But is it? Well, not really! I think the movie tries too hard to be smart but fails to engage due to its long running time & fuzzy story/script, which may end up confusing and distancing the viewer.BR 2049 has been most widely criticized for its length, and rightly so. It's overly long with some unnecessary scenes & dialogue whereas the first film was more subtle. BR1 was also slow-paced but in a different way. It had suspense and gradual progression to climax whereas BR2 is forced and even distracting at times. I love slow-paced films don't get me wrong! I can watch a film all day as long as it leads to a point and has tension. Certain films are deliberately made slow to establish a specific mood (e.g. Kubrick & Tarkovsky films). They draw you inside the film and make you feel like you're part of it. BR1 does this perfectly while the sequel is stretched out for the wrong reasons. It comes across as an excuse to showcase impressive visuals which is great if it moves the story along but not for the fun of it. BR1 had long takes and brief dialogue but it drove the story along smoothly and its characters behaved realistically. There was a seamless flow to it. It's humorous how BR2 tried to mimic this technique from BR1 yet failed because its characters talk & move super slowly unlike real life.Although it's a visually stunning film, I found it to be almost void of emotions and musicality. The characters were uninteresting and lacked emotional depth. In other words, I didn't care about them. I was not sure about any of the characters' motivations. In the first film, all the characters shined with charismatic personalities. They were unique in their own way and I truly cared about them. They embodied everything that makes us human. This was a vital element that made the original so special. BR2 on the other hand has sad and forgettable characters. It is a very sad film whereas the original had moments of happiness to mix up feelings and lighten the mood, which made it more realistic.The music in BR 2049 was the biggest let down for me. It just didn't make sense because there was no music. A strange mix of very loud noises with faint echoes of original Vangelis tones interlaced (I listened to the entire score to be sure!). The musical score by Vangelis in the first film was one of the key elements that made the original my favorite film of all-time. I love atmospheric films that are visually & musically driven to tell the story. The music creates different feelings that make you fantasize. It makes you feel the movie and think about it long after it's over. The music in BR1 was incredible. It set the tone of the film perfectly. There was a haunting eerie atmosphere that along with the images created a hypnotic feel. Vangelis mostly used an electronic sound but he also incorporated piano & saxophone for melancholic effect. Not so in BR2. They messed up enormously this time. I know it's not possible to recreate Vangelis but they could have at least tried to create similarly-styled music by using the original score as a foundation. Even better, they could have perhaps made a completely original soundtrack all together. Blade Runner is an atmospheric film that is about feel and therefore must have a perfect music to visual ratio. Sure, they brought back one Vangelis theme for nostalgia but it wasn't enough.To conclude, I enjoyed the film but unfortunately cannot say I loved it. I simply cannot fathom the enormous praise given by critics & moviegoers. I don't think they understood what made the first film brilliant. BR 2049 does contain the main elements required for a true Sci-Fi film but fell flat at further exploring its themes. The original film on the other hand is a masterpiece. It felt spiritual & spellbinding whilst the sequel did not. Should you go see it? Yes. I would still recommend fans and anyone curious to go see this film in theaters despite its evident flaws. But as a huge fan it left me disappointed. Maybe I had high expectations! I gave it a generous 7/10"
"The worst thing is its length and slow pace. How long do they think we can tolerate a dystopian future where you have a job, an apartment, cool gear and a super slender girlfriend that cooks for you and sets you up for a threesome???
Yup stupid film. It's a sequel."
".... is only second to American remakes of foreign movies. When Hollywood remakes international movies my house begins to stink.With that said, sequels are a close second and this so-called Blade Runner shows why. In other words, Blade Runner 2049 is contradictory (pretty holographic wife cooking meals and showing skin... yeah earth sucks now, take that off worlders... yeah what a hell hole) and just a cash cow. Ridley Scott has finally ran out of different video versions of the original to release and people are sick of the alien prequels and sequels he kept pushing out (they all sucked) and so he's back here.Get some integrity."
"I am leaving you. We are done. Your endless sequels and franchise movies are boring and uninspired. Frankly, forgive my crudeness, they all suck.
You think bringing a couple of sexy babes into our lives will save our marriage. They do not. I watch the chicks, but I still know that you are boring and the fire and passion are gone.
Take care."
"Could someone explain? This is a post apocalyptic world. It is a hellhole. It is a dystopia. Then one can eat food in abundance on the street and a beautiful blonde hooker approaches you (actually several pretty girls), there is miniskirted fantasy awaiting at home and cooking for you and obviously there is more than enough space for everybody. What the heck??"
"Blade Runner 2049 of course came with its own expectations and a bar that was set quite high. I was drawn in by the promise of that universe, the graphics and the giant holographic woman and was not disappointed. The CGI and the building, as well as the beautiful women were what I expected. I wish I had a 'wife' that pretty.Unfortunately, again the bar was set high, but this film did not deliver. There are too many loose ends and the film does not give the audience a conclusion. The major surprise regarding replicants and what they can do is also a bridge too far. I do agree that the film is slow, which coupled with the lack of a conclusion brings my rating down.6/10"
"The rest: 0 starsBoringWell it is a sequel after all, what did I expect?Anyway, this makes no sense, the girl is hot but I do not understand the point of the film when the replicants are not replicants anymore."
"I've only seen the original Blade Runner once and it was a long time ago. I liked it but I just haven't got around to revisiting it. I mention this because even though I'm not a die-hard fan of Blade Runner, I still found the plot of 2049 engrossing. It's a well put together mystery, I found that they constantly took the plot in unexpected directions and other than the trailer spoiling the return of Deckard, I was always excited about what was going to happen next. The movie pulls an excellent bait and switch at the end that really surprised me. They made the right decision to not repeat the formula of the first one and take the story to a new place. They also create some compelling subplots which is something that few movies get right.The biggest star of this movie is the cinematography and the excellent work of Roger Deakins. The original was noteworthy with the special environment that Ridley Scott and his creative team brought to the screen. That was continued here if not improved upon. The look of L.A. in 2049 they decided to go with isn't completely distinct but it was a little more understated (I'd compare it to the 2017 Ghost in the Shell but less fantastical). My favourite scene might have been a shootout in a defunct club where the lighting and the background show are turning on and off. I don't hesitate to praise when a movie looks good but this is an exemplary example of using visuals and atmosphere to help build on a strong story.Blade Runner 2049 returns very few of the characters from the original film but they manage to breathe life into this movie through the new ones they created. Officer K isn't the most lively protagonist but he gets an eye-opening character arc that kept me involved. Deckard doesn't appear till later in the movie but he remains interesting and what they decide to do with him makes his appearance worthwhile. I also really liked some of the smaller supporting characters. Sapper really helps kick off the movie, what Joi represents is extremely emotional and Mariette is so mysterious that her involvement brings up more and more questions. Add in that Niander Wallace and Luv make for pretty menacing villains and you have a pretty well-rounded and fascinating script.I don't think that the actors/actresses will be the focal point of the awards attention that this movie will get but that doesn't mean there aren't exemplary performances. Gosling is good as K, he's deliberately robotic and he accomplishes a lot through his subtlety. Harrison Ford isn't in the movie as much as I wanted him to be (he's still one of my all-time favourite actors) but he holds up his end. He works with Gosling well and they have a solid rapport. Surprisingly, I really liked Sylvia Hoeks. She stole a lot of her scenes and I thought she was great even acting against a stacked cast. Dave Bautista showed he has a lot more range than people give him credit for. Jared Leto is in a very Jared Leto role (deliberately weird and hard to understand) but he does it well and although he might be a little creepy, the guy is still a great actor. I also want to credit Ana de Armas, she was distinctly warm and she showed a lot more emotion than I had seen from her previously.There were points in this movie I could have rated this a 9/10 but some small things that I had to dock the movie for. Even with a compelling story, the movie has such a long run time that it couldn't help but drag. There are certain scenes where the movie wants you to really drink in the environment but they could have edited it a little tighter. They also couldn't help but lose me at points through how much artistic flair the utilize. Villenueve is an authority in this area and while I appreciate an artistic approach to this science fiction tale, for me they overdid it a little.I was surprised how much I ended up liking Blade Runner 2049. I think if you're a big fan of the original, you'll love this to bits. This is successful in bringing in the uninitiated but I think fans will enjoy this even more. I haven't been on board for all of Villenueve's films but this is a good combination of his artistic style with enough of a commercial element for the masses. I'd give this somewhere between an 8-9 but with the extremely long run time, I'll give this an 8/10."
"Involving a couple of flaunting babies, but otherwise this film is stupid. Do you remember the criticism of the prequel where Rachel and Deckard ride into the sunset on a glorious road amidst beautiful nature? Right. Here too you can live in opulance in a casino and drink free whiskey and even have your own cute dog, etc.
Snore. What can I tell you? Sequels."
"Denis Villeneuve, you magnificent world wonder, you did it again!I have seen this film three times in the cinema, in 3D, 2D and 4DX.And one of the things i have noticed with this film, is that it's not the time in the cinema that takes up my time, It's the hours upon hours in between spent thinking about the film, that is the real time consumer. This film left such a deep and profound impact, which i cannot escape. And I've gone back to the cinema twice to be ""tortured"", but it's worth it.It's a dark, mysterious, grim, hopeless, sad and lonely film, set in a possible near future where the human race is hanging by their fingertips on the edge of doom. So it's quite depressing. But it's so brilliantly put together, the closest master of cinema i think of that has done something similar, is Stanley Kubrick.Many Stanley Kubrick films were also ""hated"" by many when they first released. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" for example, which had gorgeous visuals, but felt flat and hollow for many, even professional reviewers back then. But what Kubrick did best with his films, was to create afterthought. People left the cinema feeling confused and even depressed, but the movies planted a seed which then grew for years. The original Blade Runner also accomplished this. BR2049 is no exception, this movie will without doubt live on to be interpreted, analyzed and discussed for decades to come. The story continues from the original, but stands completely on it's own, it tells a new story that directly interlink with the original, but without trying to be a copy, it's a natural continuation in the same universe. You don't have to see the original Blade Runner first, though i do recommend it, see the final cut.BR2049 has some of the most gorgeous visuals i have ever seen, and the cinematography is out of this world, there is literally no excuse not to give Roger Deakins the Oscar this time. After 13 nominations he has now knocked the ball out of the park and is this year in his own league entirely. It's confusing to look at something so gorgeous, whilst painting a picture of such a sad and lost world. It sort of collides with your senses, your eyes say it's beautiful, your mind say it's depressing. Which senses are you going to believe? What does it mean? At least don't confuse feeling depressed as a sign that this movie is bad, it's nothing wrong feeling depressed, take it in, embrace it. Then you will know how it feels to be a replicant that's trapped in a caged mind.BR2049's story happens 30 years after the original, and there is three short films on Youtube i recommend you watch. These short films describes some of what happened in between 2019 and 2049. Watching them makes it slightly easier to understand some of the things going on. But the underlying theme is the same as it was in the original. What does it mean to be human? What does it mean to have memories? What is a soul? And so on.The world has gone darker in 2049, climate is spinning out of control, almost all animals and plants have died. People are desperate and lost, law enforcement can barely keep anything together, and only a small spark can set of total disaster, which is looming just around every corner. Niander Wallace has taken over Tyrell Corp and has by the time 2049 takes place designed millions of obedient replicants that does exactly what he tells them to do. But there is one thing Wallace has not been able to perfect, and that's what the main story is all about, and Wallace will do anything in his power to get his hands on the ""technology"", which will result in him becoming many hundred times richer and more powerful, the sole ruler of the entire universe. He is so far gone in his mind by 2049 he actually believes he is god himself, and he calls his replicants angels.And of course he also uses replicants to do his ""dirty work"". In 2049 we meet his right hand ""girl"" Luv (Brilliantly played by Sylvia Hoeks, if there is one actor in this movie that steal the show, it's her). Luv is a ""handygirl"" so to speak, that perform whatever task she is set to do, with no remorse. Or is that entirely true? I can't spoil anything, but look closely at Luv's character arc. All the other actors also do an outstanding job in this film, no bad performances, but i can't talk about all of them due to the word limit in these reviews.Be prepared going to see this film, it's depressing and heavy on your mind, and it demands your full attention. It's one of those rare films who dares to challenge the audience, and by doing so, taking a huge risk, and a 155 million dollar risk at that. The film isn't perfect, but it's close, and it shows the tremendous skills of Denis Villeneuve. And those few mistakes this movie have, are probably just happy little accidents as Rob Ross would have put it. This film is very much like a painting, every stroke of the brush matters, and every little detail is carefully crafted, it takes monumental skills to pull it of.I loved this film, it's the best film I've seen all year, It is a must see, a monumental triumph of a film that's just as good (possibly even better) as the original and one of the best sequels of all time!9.7/10 - MasterpieceAnd BTW Villeneuve's next movie might be Dune, imagine if he brings Deakins and the rest of this team to make that movie. Yeah, I'm going to leave you with that thought. This is basically porn."
Hollywood needs to stop making these meaningless sequels. They are for losers and only made for cash hoarding because if Hollywood was lacking cash it would not pay all these no-talents in the millions.
".. to come to think this is a good movie.The pretty women and fantasy are welcome and certainly a pleasant rarity in these anti-human body times, but this sequel (yup the problem right there) is boring and should not exist.It is forced, too long and the contrast to its prequel damning."
"""Blade Runner 2049"" comes off incredibly long and boring. Not because of the slow pacing – ""Blade Runner"" had slow pacing too, but had the viewer hypnotized – but because there's no interesting thoughts present and nothing new really. Thematically the movie is exploring the same questions (about being human etc.) as the first movie did 35 years ago. And the few 'new' additions to the Blade Runner universe are totally devoid of originality. Take for instance K's hologram-wife. Not only are those scenes totally unnecessary (that three-way scene, jeez!), but we've seen the concept so many times before (for instance in Spike Jonze's ""Her""). Apart from that, the movie is riddled with plot holes and stuff that just don't make very much sense. Tyrell get's killed off by a replicant and his Nexus-7 prototype runs off, shortly after Tyrell Corp rushes a line of replicants with OPEN ENDED lifespans and no other safety device than implanted memories (that didn't work with Rachael). No. Just no. Furthermore we are told the nexus 9 are programmed to obey. However K lies to his superiors, constantly acts on his own, acts emotionally from early on in the movie. He does not obey at all. And the revelation of a replicant child being born has people talking about revolution. Robin Wrights Joshi says it will 'break the world'. But how? Rachael was the only replicant able to give birth and Tyrell took that secret with him. Neither the few remaining Nexus 8's or the 9's can give birth – so no, it doesn't break the world. It doesn't break anything. But the movie really wants us to take this very seriously (Hans Zimmer is doing his loudest to make us sit in awe). And it gets even worse. Later we learn that Jared Leto's ridiculous bad guy Wallace (those monologues!) strives to learn the secret of making replicant babies. But why? That undermines the entire idea of replicants. Tailormade slaves with superhuman ability; strength, intelligence etc. that are controlled by implanted memories. Having replicants make babies the old way would offer zero control of the outcome and the child replicants would have to grow up, go to school, make their own memories. What's the point then? And what's the difference, from just having some people make babies? A lot of people has called ""Blade Runner 2049"" 'intellectual sci-fi' and so forth, but I found it to be quite the contrary. The movie forcefully demands you to accept it as highly intelligent art, but if you scratch the surface, you'll find something very different."
"Every part of this movie is useless, absolutely boring. story is hilarious, and the characters are all useless and unneeded.Sure they put in a chick in a short skirt and a dog and we feel something, but the script is meaningless."
Bad: destroys its prequel What gives? The terrorist capitalist was not funny The backstabber was so true I was sickGood: Pretty girls Nice sights Finally a girl who is really interested in her man instead of searching on the net for him and doing other research
Aside from some strange behaviour there was not much point so I fell asleep. Also the music was LOUD and even buried the dialogue
"SPOILERS ALERT: The biggest difference between 1982 masterpiece and this one is that in the first film everything is happening at a normal speed. In original movie people talk like they talk in real life, their move at perfectly normal, every day, common speed, it doesn't take them forever to finish the sentence, or to shape out a thought, and yet... somehow it all works perfectly together.There's no way to know how will people (let alone robots) act or talk in thirty plus years, but if it is to be anything like in BR2049, I suspect it will be a pretty bleak and exhausting world.From the moment one, everybody talks, walks, plays, runs in some super-strange slow-mo: I'd say at 50% of the normal speed. It takes 10 seconds for poor Ryan Gosling only to take out something from his pocket. Not to say how long it takes him to walk through the scene - so much that half way through, let's say, the orphanage part, I have already forgotten what is he doing there in the first place.20 minutes into the movie, all I'm doing is wondering when this shot is going to end, when this scene is going to end, when the sequence will, and, ultimately, when the movie is going to end. This is not the way to pay a homage, to anybody or anything.There is a reason why the shots in ""2001 Odyssey..."" are that long, somebody should've warned the director about that. And there's also a reason why all shots in the original BR are that tight. And that's just one of the reasons to why both 2001 and BR are masterpieces. And for that same reason, BR2049 could that never be.You don't drag out every single aspect of the movie just to make it seem serious or pretend to be an artist, no. If you do, you get very expensive, anemic boredom. I have no idea why the director did it - he hasn't done it in that fairly fair movie with Hugh Jackman. What possessed him to do it here? Was it the importance of the first movie? Was it his fear to look like a schoolboy in front of the Master? Don't know, don't care.What a waste of great actors, class all - forcing them to engage in some sort of quasi elevated, quasi profound, but genuinely bizarre ballet that has nothing, nothing, nothing to do with the real life. The movie is three hours plus long only for the given reason - it would have been an hour shorter if had played out at normal pace.Oh - and to end here - the biggest dread of all: a hint of a possible franchise. Please, please, please people, for the love of all that's holly. Don't."
"I could tell 15 minutes in that this film did not need to be made. It was boring. It was trying to justify its own existence. It was trying to figure out how to sell itself. It was trying to fit in elements from the original Blade Runner into its visuals to claim it has a relationship to the prequel.
I suggest people stop spending money on these films because Hollywood won't stop remaking and rebooting on its own."
"What a disappointment, so much hype and, therefore, expectation but this is no more than a competent sci-fi film, certainly not a worthy successor to the original. I could support a 163 minute run time if there was plenty of content but at times it felt like the actors were moving and speaking slowly not for effect, but to fill in the gaps. As for the plot, everything revolved around the ability or otherwise of replicants to breed. If you have the technology to grow a human body from scratch and implant whatever memories you want I'd have thought introducing the mechanics of reproduction wouldn't be difficult. I could go on but really, this film isn't worth the bother."
"Both the film and the music looks excellent at first glance, but it pales terribly when you dive a little deeper and compare it to the original. So please don't downvote this review, if you're not really familiar with the original film and soundtrack, because my review is written for those who are.The three stars are for the excellent visual qualities and the fact that you will definetely enjoy it, if you haven't seen the original Blade Runner film or simply forgot its main point.The story betrays most important character (Roy Batty)'s message in the original film, because it ultimately reduces the concept of 'being human' to the ability to reproduce. The replicants have been reduced to sobbing, lonely existences walking aimlessly around looking for a 'purpose' - one that is only found when it turns out they can reproduce. How pathetic. Roy Batty and now - sadly - the man who played him - Rutger Hauer - must be dying a little extra in their graves.And finally the music: Hans Zimmer Corp.'s soundtrack is a lazy, unimaginative 'spheric' soundtrack spiced up with some remixed ripoffs of the original Vangelis masterpiece soundtrack plus some oldtimer ballads. Listen to Vangelis' completely original soundtrack and then compare it to the total lack of original material in Zimmer's score."
"Please be aware that my review contains spoilers so please do not read further if you do want to have key plot points revealed.First things first, I'm a big fan of the original and have enjoyed immensely with each viewing, first from when I was a 10 year old until 2 weeks ago so I was interested to see what Villeneuve would do with the sequel.Watched it Saturday and must say the experience left me somewhat underwhelmed and frustrated at seeing such an opportunity to do something original go to waste, that I have decided to post my thoughts here on IMDb for the first time.In no particular here are some of my questions and general points about the film.Jared Leto's performance. How the hell is he such a high paid star? I cannot think of anything he is particularly memorable and this is no exception.His eyes. Are they distracting on purpose?If his character saved the world from starvation, how come there aren't millions of people worshiping him? Humans are suckers for finding idols and why should his character be any different. Crikey, we have dictators in our world who had days and months of the year named after family members. Why doesn't Wallace have a massive army organised to hunt down Deckard instead of entrusting this to one replicant and a few goons?Monologues giving exposition is lazy storytelling and old Wallace loves a monologue.What is his plan? He wants to produce more replicants but kills one at the start for some spurious reason. Hint hint, to show the audience he is a very naughty boy. He also has the Rachel replicant killed. No wonder he cannot make enough replicants if he keeps killing them.Ryan Gosling plays Ryan Gosling again and although I don't dislike his performances, I find it hard to root for his character here, as I've seen it before in a much better film (Drive).The music wasn't particularly memorable and only made me think of the much better soundtrack from Bladerunner. Apparently this was intentional on Villeneuve's part as he removed the original composer who wanted to do something original. So instead, the director opted for Zimmer to make it more Bladerunnery and therefore less memorable for this film. The film did not merit or need the run-time it had. I appreciate the original BR took its time but it had a new world to show usThe ending was goofy and ridiculous. Why would K bring Deckard to his daughter who is the most wanted person in the history of wanted people? This will definitely endanger her given that Leto's character has a relationship with her and probably has her under some sort of surveillance. Hero comes back from the dead to save the day cliché at end was extremely predictable and had me rolling my eyes, which I shouldn't be doing when watching a film for the first time.The blackout sounds like a much more interesting story than this. Caused by replicants? A solar flare? Was there a Trump two term presidency in this universe?Robots reproducing and creating their own has already been covered in Battlestar Galactica, who did it in a more compelling fashion with characters and stakes I cared aboutPlus, how come Leto's character hasn't figured out on to get replicants to reproduce? Why can't he produce them faster? How many has he killed before delivering a monologueSome of the visuals are stunning though lack depth or colour. The future looks fairly boring in comparison to Bladerunner 1982, which offered some very unusual street shots and characters. One scene included a guy with a eagle on his head. Nothing to really catch the eye in BR2049. Why not have Rachel as leader of the rebellion instead of some random person the audience has no connection with. When the capture Deckard, why on earth wouldn't they kill K? How did K know how to find the car with Dekkard at the end? We don't see him doing any investigative work to discover this information, despite the long run time.They made a replicant clone of Rachel but get the eye colour wrong? Seriously?How heavy handed was the prejudice? No subtlety whatsoever. Jeepers, you spend all that money on effects but then go minimum wage on screen writers. That sex scene reminded me of Ghost with all the syncing going on. Watching Whoopi do her thing was just as sexy as watching this scene, despite it having two incredibly attractive women present, along with Ryan Gosling who is no slouch himself in the looks department.The replicant rebellion feels shoehorned in rather than something which has grown and developed organically. Need to take lessons from Star Wars on how to introduce a rebel alliance story.The golden rule of cinema is broken here when they show/play clips from a much better film.Critics are only offering gushing praise for a film with considerable flaws because they don't wish to get caught out like the critics of 82. Back then, the critics hated it because they couldn't see the hidden depth. This time they see depth that simply isn't there. Even one of the characters says something along these lines to another."
"...the return of the giant Atari sign from the original Blade Runner.OK, quick story synopsis. Bones found of a Replicant who's given birth. How was it possible and where is the child (now adult)?I'm sorry, but having waited 35 years for this movie it just didn't press any buttons for me. It's an hour too long, the story-line is weak to non-existent and doesn't get answered, the theory of Deckard's origin is again teased at but not answered (even though there really is very little in the original to point to him being a repilicant).This is another SFX over substance movie. Looks good, although very dark in the 3D version, but there just doesn't seem to be the energy and edginess of the original. It all seems too NICE. Having seen the original movie over 30 times, I'm not sure I'll bother returning to this new story. I have to agree with Rutger Hauer about trying to add to a perfect movie."
"Blade Runner is one of my favorite films of all time for a number of reasons: 1) Amazing groundbreaking trailblazing visuals that spawned an entire genre (aka ""cyberpunk""). 2) Superb music by Vangelis that is integral to the film. 3) Great characters and amazing acting. 4) Underlying philosophical themes of corporate oppression (Blade Runner is just a small cog in a huge machine just carrying on with his life doing the job because otherwise he's reduced to nothing), existentialism (what it means to be human) coupled with Biblical references presented in a subtle way. 5) Amazing practical special effects that make the world around the characters feel lived-in. 6) Meticulous attention to detail, lighting in particular. While ""2049"" is nothing more than a mere attempt at recreating something in the style of the original by a studio committee ticking off the items in the checklist. The result is abysmal because it does not introduce something new in terms of visual design, interesting characters, music or story. On the contrary it tries so hard to tie itself to the original it's sickening. Call it fan-service or pandering, either way it leads to the movie being a highly derivative product that exists solely because of the original.1) Plot lines that go against the premise of the original (Nexus 6 being able to reproduce, new Nexus 8 being easily distinguishable from humans) are stupid. 2) Acting is horrendous. Ana ""Pouty lips"" De Armas couldn't hold a candle to Sean Young not to mention the pretentious for pretentiousness sake Jared Leto. Ford is here for a paycheck and Gosling is deliberately one-note. 3) The music is a lame attempt at copying Vangelis' beautiful score.4) Too varying visuals leave you with this feeling of an inconsistent world that doesn't follow the idea of polluted lifeless post-industrial world where the sun doesn't shine, it's constantly raining and the only light outside the building is that of the advertising that seems more real than anything else. 5) Running time. The original was purposefully slow while the overblown running time of the sequel comes off as director loving certain sets and trying to savor them far longer than he should've. 6) A myriad of logical mistakes and plot holes (kids with a 100% matching DNA are of different gender).7) The opening shot with the closeup of an eye is almost beat for beat with the original. 8) The zooming sequence is hammered home by the sheer repetition. 9) The characters are bland, unoriginal and politically correct female copies of the originals, namely Madam and Luv. 10) The opening sequence is the unused part of the Fancher's script (watch Dangerous Days documentary). Overall it seems that producers/writers have an erroneous idea of made the original film great. As if stuffing Biblical references into Neon- lit set pieces, inhabited by some pale copies of original characters and extending the awkward silences would amount to a great movie. To sum up ""Blade Runner 2049"" does not reinvent the wheel, does not offer anything one-of-a-kind or even slightly memorable. There is no reason (other than cash flow for the studio execs) for it to exist. Save the cash and rewatch the original that actually challenges your intelligence and leaves you with a lot to think about."
"The first movie (which should have stayed the only movie) is a masterpiece of sci fi. I was hooked from the start great story and for the time great FX also cannot beat the soundtrack by Vangelis.Not sure what is going on with Ridley Scott first with is Alien Convenant he destroyed the series there and now with the new addition of blade runner.I feel that all the positive reviews for this movie are fake, because the movie is a sad excuse to make money and makes no sense at all, no surprised it failed this weekend at the box office.The acting is good so are the special effects, but the story is weak and none existent, Tyrell corporation is gone and there is a new company that makes the replicans, and tyrell had found a way for them to reproduce and have babies.This is where the story gets weird, Deckard is brought back into the mix because he had a child with Rachel.The movie also lack action and in the end does not explain anything. I felt like a huge waste of 2h and a half.35y in the making for this wow just wow."
"BR2049 has more plot holes than emmental cheese and one big ""plot twist"" that I won't mention, not because it would spoil much, but because if you decide to watch this movie, you deserve to be disappointed by its stupidity.The big ""twist"" is mentioned as the ""miracle"", but it is absolutely idiotic and illogical from the point of view of a manufacturer of replicants. How did ""that"" might have ever be considered a good idea? One would assume that after the disaster of the Nexus 6 series, Tyrell Co. and his successors would have invented some more reliable security system - such as a lower level of self-consciousness, way safer than the questionable ""obedience"" of the Nexus 8. Or even something like all the androids looking the same, so that they can be easily detected and you would not need blade runners to locate and eliminate them.Anything that would provide humanity with useful, free labor without ethical problems But no, in this movie ethical problems just got exponentially bigger. And so much for a science so advanced as to reproduce perfect bodies and minds...Besides, since it is established that humankind sucks, I failed to understand how replicants are in any way better, since they just want to be more ""like humans"". On the visual side, BR2049 sucks, too. Looks like they used random leftovers scenery from other Sci-Fi/disaster movies, from the overused industrial background of Terminator to the desertic blurred landscape of MadMax and the inevitable nightmarish city-scape, which looks like Blade Runner, but on cheap side. Costumes looks like the contemporary drab clothing promoted by Nordic high street chains: lots of dark, cheap-looking leggings and stretchy tops, a far cry from the decadent, elaborate futuristic/retro suits of BR.In one scene, Deckard meets Tyrell's successor in a closed room filled with water, except a square island in the middle. A room that has no other reason to exist except bringing back memories of the ""original"" Tyrell building.The dialog is unbelievable bad and scenes drag on forever. When the Goslin character finds Deckart, the two spend over ten minutes fighting and chasing each other, when a couple of lines of dialogue would have avoided that. The ending is both manipulative and plagiarist: it wants to move the audience, recreating the amazing poetic moment of Roy Batty's death, but using snow instead of rain. If nothing else, the ending would have been enough to put me off this piece of commercial garbage."
"In 1982 I was deeply excited about the prospect of seeing ""Blade Runner,"" and can remember applying for a chance to see an advance showing in Sacramento. From the start it seemed obvious that it was a special film--clouded in controversy and mystery. Later I acquired my much-viewed VHS copy, with all the eye-gouging, nail-puncturing violence. Later still the Internet provided background information as, eventually, did articles plus a comprehensive book by Paul M. Sammon. In short, I am a fan, and was eagerly anticipating the sequel.So, it was with disappointment that I left an October 6, 2017 showing ""Blade Runner 2049."" Overly long, boring, poorly paced, and confusing were my initial impressions, though admittedly it was beautifully filmed (potential Oscar nomination in cinematography?).I appreciated the many (too many?) subtle and not-so-subtle nods to the original film, the effort to build on the ""Blade Runner"" universe, and efforts by writers, directors, and actors to bring the story to life. But there were just too many scenes that should have been reduced in length from 25-50% of their run time. Such excess in a film is, to me, almost always a fatal flaw. And some scenes (e.g., where characters ""Joi"" and ""Mariette"" merge to make love to ""K"") could have been cut altogether, I feel, without harming the story.The acting was satisfactory or better, for the most part, as one would expect from the level of supporting talent.* However, I have knowingly seen two pictures starring Ryan Gosling—2016's ""La La Land"" and now this—and in both he is bland and wooden. Despite the fact that ""2049's"" ""K"" is SUPPOSED to be a self-controlled, artificial humanoid, I wonder if it is just Gosling's natural on- (and off-) screen persona. And frankly, Harrison Ford's ""Deckard"" just did not work for me. Sacrilegious, I know; but true. I blame this on two factors.First, Ford appears (too) late in the movie, by which time I was already exhausted by tedium. Second, for a character without appearance-changing makeup, a dramatic accent, say, or pronounced behavioral distinctions, it is hard not to just see Harrison Ford. (Kind of like Robert Redford miscast in 1985's ""Out of Africa."") Oh, it's (old) Harrison Ford again. Sorry HF fans everywhere.And another thing; due to poor direction, they included ""Admiral William Adama"" (Edward James Olmos) from TV's ""Battlestar Galactica,"" and not ""Gaff"" (also Olmos), in a too brief cameo. (Listen to ""Gaff"" in the 1982 original. Totally different voicing.)Like most films, it suffered from its share of ""Oh, come on!"" moments. Why would 6-foot ""K"" allow 6-foot-6 Dave Bautista's imposing ""Sapper Morton"" to make the first move (and thus begin the accumulation of a ridiculous amount of damage, most of it unnecessary, sustained by ""K"" throughout the story)? Because that's what movie detectives do. I must say, ""K"" apparently likes to pass violently through solid walls (a nod to Rutger Hauer's ""Roy Batty"" head in the original, I take it).Almost all action-adventure films are silly in hindsight and full of movie plot clichés—""Blade Runner 20149"" is no exception. But the test of a good movie is whether the story flows at a pace that makes audiences subconsciously accept and even relish these otherwise nonsensical encumbrances (see 1999's ""The Matrix""). For my part I was less inclined to give ""2049"" a pass on the silliness due to its plodding nature.Ridley Scott is prominently associated with both the recent ""Alien"" and Blade Runner"" franchises, and has promised multiple sequels. Do we want this? Is state-of-the-art movie-making worth either ridiculously poor stories (the ""Alien"" franchise) or bad plotting and editing (""Blade Runner 2049"")? It's admittedly hard to make a good movie, but Scott and his people are paid a LOT of money to do so. Check Scott's IMDb filmography. Can any mortal be involved first-hand in that many projects? As with Stephen King, maybe it's time to pare down the quantity and re-focus on the quality? Just sayingIn conclusion, my disappointment focused primarily on the script and editing.**Some recommendations to potential viewers: First, if you plan to see ""Blade Runner 2049"" it will help to see one of 37 versions (e.g., voice-over or no voice-over?; graphic violence shots or not?) of the original 1982 film beforehand. Second, maybe wait to watch the movie digitally, so that you can re-play key scenes and increase volume on important dialogue. In the theater I kept mentally reaching for a non-existent remote control. Third, (after Recommendation One) if like me you hold the original picture in deep admiration as a flawed but intriguing analog masterpiece of SF movie-making, consider skipping this sequel altogether. But I imagine that warning will fall on deaf ears._____* Because of the look and feel of two female characters in the film, I wonder if actresses Felicity Jones (""Rogue One"") and Tatiana Maslany (""Orphan Black"") were originally considered for the parts eventually played by Ana de Armas (companion hologram ""Joi"") and Sylvia Hoeks (deadly replicant ""Luv""). While watching the trailer footage, I originally mistook those two characters for actresses Jones and Maslany. Their doppelgangers did just fine, though. Hoeks' ""Luv"" is particularly chilling.** Oh, and the music! Not so good. Too often I was aware of background music--that by itself is not a good thing--and its shortcomings. So much so that by the end of ""2049,"" where original ""Blade Runner"" music (""Tears in the Rain,"" I think) is (finally) used, it left me with mixed feelings. First, thank god! Second, where was that musical excellence during the rest of the film? Music can make or break a film, and is incredibly important. Few excellent films have poor musical soundtracks. Unfortunately, ""Blade Runner 2049"" is not an exception to that guideline."
"I didn't realise 2049 also was the actual length of the film! It sure felt like it! 3 hours of boring dialogue, hollow characters and an embarrassingly weak story. Hard to believe Ridley Scott really made this!The first Blade Runner worked the pace of the film brilliantly up to the powerful ending. The story was a rather simple sci-fi noir detective story with a twist. It made some huge comments on humanity and what kind of future we want. It worked on so many levels. It could be viewed as a simple sci-fi detective story or as a great spiritual journey that asked all the big questions. ""And what can your maker do for you?"".The first Blade Runner had so many great lines but with 2049 I cannot remember a single quotable line. 2049 completely lacks all which made the original the best sci-fi movie ever. I take the same view as Rutger Hauer recently did. Why even try to do a second one? It would be as painting a second Mona Lisa. Or building another Eiffel tower.A huge disappointment of a sequel that should never have been made."
"The original Blade Runner is one of my favourite films so I was really looking forward to this one. What a disappointment. If I wasn't in the company of others I would of walked out early. I left the cinema feeling annoyed that I had to sit through this overlong monotonous film. The storyline is dragged out with the main character just going from place to place to investigate something like in a video game. At the beginning he is in a fight scene and you find out he is basically indestructible. The replicants are now terminators. This leaves out any suspense that he is in danger. The first film was kind of believable, the city was overcrowded and the building were decaying - it had atmosphere. This one looked like a more modern city with a lot of emptiness. The technology has advanced so much that he now has a solid light fully realistic AI holographic companion that operates from a small device he can keep in his pocket. If you think about it why are they so desperate to increase replicant slave labour production when they are capable of building AI robots that can be enveloped with holographic light to look human. They still have the blurry 1950 TV quality monitors to echo the first film but the supposed technology jump does not make sense. The music by Vangelis was one of the most important parts of the original. He conveyed through the use of synthesisers and traditional instruments a sense of awe and wonder, beauty and the sadness of a dystopian world. Johann Johannsson was originally commissioned to score the film and I think he would of done a great job but they decided for some reason it was not Hollywood sounding enough so they bought in Hans Zimmer. What a disaster. It might as well be the music from Batman VS Alien. Just lots of loud noise. The original was a box office failure that became a cult classic. This is just a failure."
"There would be something... as it stands there is nothing in this film other than sinful ungodly sex. I wasted my time. I am definitely not interested in watching the original.Evil. ZzzzzzzzzzzzzzHollywood, you have no original ideas = go home."
"I never was one of those people asking for a Blade Runner sequel. Now that Blade Runner 2049 is out, my position still stands. This film is simply a massive letdown and nothing more.The year is 2049 and the world has grown in technology, but not humanity. Ryan Gosling plays K, a Blade Runner (a futuristic cop) tasked with tracking down the last of the Replicants-androids that look like humans. Knowing that he himself is a replicant, he goes on a journey of his own when he finds a box containing the bones of a Replicant who gave birth to a child and is tasked with finding the child. Little does he know that the new head of the Tyrell Corporation that makes the Replicants, Mr. Wallace (Jared Leto), plans to use the missing child for his own purposes and kill K if he has to.My main problem with the film is that it was unforgivably boring. The film is two hours and forty-five minutes long, which is already enough to test one's patience (and bladder), but it feels so deliberately paced; the characters almost always move so slow, that it feels like the filmmakers thought that it was the best way to pad out the running time, despite having not enough material to justify it.The performances range from great to laughable. Harrison Ford is hardly in the movie, and his inclusion is clearly a marketing ploy, but he gives the best performance in his brief running time and he feels like a continuation of his character from the original, Deckard, in a world where things have just gotten worse. Gosling isn't bad as K, and his stone-face actually is pretty effective in a couple of scenes, but Rutger Hauer in the original gave his Replicant character more of a personality. Leto is trying and failing to bring a degree of menace as the villain, and his female Replicant sidekick competes with him in the field of phoning it in.What else shocked me was how unsubtle the film was. The original was not only a futuristic crime noir that had Harrison Ford's Deckard chasing down androids, but also a personal journey involving himself and Rutger Hauer as the villain that involved trying to find a degree of humanity in such a futuristic world, and that maybe, Deckard is a replicant himself. Here, the story is mainly of Gosling trying to come to terms with the fact that he is a Replicant and what it means in terms of his humanity. Whereas in the original, there were subtle signs, images, and bits of dialogue that hinted at Deckard's purpose in the original, everything is spelled out for the audience to the point that old bits of dialogue are repeated thrice at important moments. It doesn't respect the audience's intelligence at all. The first and final thirds of the film are mainly filled with dialogue that is basically speeches that preach ideas about conflict and the ethics of machines, but hardly any of it is explored in an interesting fashion. What's worse, the film feels so empty and devoid that for a time, I forgot what K's objective was.What I will say is that the cinematography is beautiful. There are a lot of colorful images with ancient ruins and futuristic tech in the background and foreground that could easily pass as being part of an art gallery. The only downside is that there is too much gray in some shots and it feels too clean compared to the original.Why Warner Brothers and Sony wasted their time making this film, I have no clue. Maybe it was Ridley Scott's fault. After being unimpressed with his Alien: Covenant earlier this year (and was also quite the snooze-fest), watching this only proved to me further that Scott just doesn't care about good filmmaking anymore. Denis Villeneuve is clearly an ambitious director, but his style didn't feel completely right for this film. Clearly, in a film that tries so desperately to say much more humanity than its predecessor, it comes out feeling empty and feels less human than the original did.P.S. A lot of people have accused me of being too shallow and wanting this film to be more action packed. I do not have that mindset. I enjoy films that take their time as much as the next film enthusiast, but this one just didn't do enough to justify what it was aiming for. I'm not ashamed in expressing my opinion. Just let me be clear on something: going at a slow, deliberate pace and speaking lines of preachy dialogue does not, I repeat, does not equal intelligence. The positive reviews baffle me, especially on Rotten Tomatoes. Sony owns the company, which leads me to think that maybe it bribed more than a few critics in the hopes that more people would see it. Clearly, that is backfiring and I'm happy that people are rejecting it."
"Put them in front of the TV to watch this! They will fall asleep in no time flat. Voila! problem solved. What is more? They will watch a few hundred kids work as slaves and learn a lesson in being brats and demanding this and wanting that. Of course, we all know they have fallen asleep by then so you may want to show that part the fifth or sixth time you need a 'babysitter.'As for grown men, well as the reviews say the threesome was cool and the girlfriend had nice feminine hair, but you can just Youtube that."
"i cannot believe these ten star comments, first the visuals were mostly flat, there was no explanation why in this time there were virtually no people around, one scene only with about thirty extras, no lights seems to be on either in the shots were he is flying over the city. more importantly you had a very thin plot that could have been told in less than an hour. nothing happens for most of the film. it is as if all concerned were on valium. the music was just noise. talk about an anti-climatic ending, the film just whimpers out. none of the very little plot made any sense. so here we have yet again critics raving about nothing. an insult to the original in every way. do not waste your time or money going to see this. i was going to list the many non-sensical things in the film but on reflection i don't think the film deserves anymore of my time"
"I always gave the original Blade Runner 10/10. Seen it a over a 1000 times including at the movie theater. Good pace, visuals, music, likable characters, bad guys. Yup, pretty much everything. One of my top 10 movies of all time. This review for 2049 is not because it should be the same thing or make it over the top.OK now this Blade Runner 2049. Bad boring. Where nothing really means much. Unlikable characters, music is ""meh"" nothing unique(A poor version of the original_. Bad people in this, who cares? Bring us back with someone who is actually a threat(like Roy). We have some stupid terminator woman who really just flat out sucks. Poor casting. Jared Leto sucks. Yeah, he really does. Then you have the black guy with a cane from walking dead, who talks to everyone sideways. Who talks to people sideways? Why did you cast him? I've never see someone in any other movie, show or real life talk to people when they are not looking at them. Fail!!! I thought it was stupid in walking dead and now its really stupid. Plot is blah. Oh, it's also like a journey for Ryan Gosling to go from one Cameo to another with another boring scene. Not much vocab, emotion. Even Roy in the original had TONS of emotion and even had poetry at the end when he decided to turn a corner and save life instead of destroying everything in his path.Harrison Ford is just an old man in this(sorry to say). Think it's time to retire. Did nothing in this film except hold a gun in Ryan's face and get captured with handcuffs.Do not believe the hype, not a good movie."
"Spoilers ahead.Updated Nov 2019:I just finished reading Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner by Paul M. Sammon, a decent enough book although most of the book seems pretty well covered by the superb documentary ""Dangerous Days"" by Charles de Lauzirika. The book (Future Noir) was written in 2017 so everyone is all agog about the upcoming Blade Runner ""sequel"" and it's so disappointing to look back on the movie in this light. I can't even remember virtually anything ABOUT BR 2049. Apart from the awful, pointless ""fight"" between Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling. I saw the original in 1982 and it stayed with me for years, until I saw it again on TV or VHS. Great movies are like that, they linger and haunt you forever. I can't imagine anyone thinking again or wanting to watch BR 2049 again as it plays on HBO or elsewhere.Who writes reviews titled: ""One of the best sequels of all time!"" and ""A masterpiece of science fiction and possibly one of the greatest sequels ever made"" and ""A New-Age Sci-Fi Classic""?? Yep, studio shills, hacks, and trolls. These are the kind of reviews which used to get knocked off Yelp because they were so ridiculously and archly over-effusive. Real, regular folk (like you and me dontcha know) don't go in for ratings viewing boosting titles. Read: box office boosters. ""Yeah, I know you loved in mom but it ain't THAT good. Aww."" They're like testimonials on a CV\resume you've written yourself and then re-read months later and realize you've overdone it. Akk. ""Mark really is the best thing since sliced bread. He's the most amazing film reviewer in a generation....""Yep, I own the 7 DVD European version boxed set. Yes, I saw it at the Electric Theatre in Brixton when it came out. I love the original. I wanted so much to love the sequel. Most of my peeves are listed above and below, mirrored by other reviewers with whom I have forged an unhappy bond of disappointment and disbelief. And I concur. Harrison Ford was too passive. Ryan Gosling was too dull, too toned down. Sean Young's CGI was awful. Why not have her at an age like she is now? HF is nearly 80, so how about a 55-year-old Rachel. CGI of real people is tough - it never looks real and it didn't here. The set lighting was sub-par, the CGI buildings didn't look real. This is all ""by the by"" - if there had been a real script, a real story then all would be forgiven. The movie started, for me, when Joe gets to Vegas. That's how the trailer editor saw it and that's how you should see it. Get a drink join the movie about 90 minutes in and it's really not that bad after that. Some of the stuff is great. But most of it, including the eardrum-bursting ""Music"" (which was interesting in Arrival) but here, merely serves to pretend to elicit emotion. As another viewer mentioned: when the film finished, the lights suddenly went on (this was Studio Movie Grill so they needed to clean the food trays etc.) as if the theater was embarrassed at the movie's length and wanted to shuffle us out in a hurry. There was no applause, heck even mediocre films in LA get applause since half the audience works in the industry as grips, extras, teamsters etc., even in the outskirts of town. We all just shuffled out, stunned, not quite understanding how $185 million dollars in Budapest (where they made it) could have born so little fruit. Heck, you could BUY Budapest for $185m right? ;) This seems to be a very polarizing film. Lots of critics seem to like it. My wife liked it. I hated it. I hated myself for looking forward to it. I woke up depressed. I wanted to slap the screen and say: ""That's for making me care about you!"" Wack!"
"Let me start by saying that I am a huge Denis Villeneuve fan and absolutely love every movie he made, from his breakthrough drama 'Incendies' to the action thriller 'Sicario'. But when I learned that he was going to make a sequel to Ridley Scott's iconic Blade Runner I had mixed feelings. Would he be able to live up to the expectations and make a sequel that could measure itself with the original? For this reason, I went into the cinema thinking ''This will be a great movie, I am a Villeneuve fan so I have to like it'' but that was a mistake, for once I stopped expecting and just started experiencing the film, I was enchanted by all of its visual beauty. I was wrong to doubt Villeneuve; his 'Blade Runner 2049' even succeeds in transcending in some ways the original masterpiece, especially as a visual experience. The bleak dystopian future Scott so perfectly created is even more beautiful in Villeneuve's 2049, for which a lot of credit has to be given to the brilliant director of photography Roger Deakins, who has made one of his best works (which says a lot). Every shot is brilliant, I loved every single frame and I cannot imagine that he wouldn't get nominated and win an Oscar for this phenomenal work. But also a big thumbs up has to be given to the entire effects team, for Deakins didn't do it all on his own. Deakins isn't the only mastermind at work, for the score is also beautifully done. When I learned that composer Jóhann Jóhannsson (someone who has collaborated multiple times with Villeneuve and did most of the scores for his movies) got fired I was surprised; Jóhannsson has always delivered great work, but according to Villeneuve, his score ''wasn't the right one'' for this movie for it didn't ''resemble Vangelis soundtrack for Blade Runner'' quite enough. So he got replaced by probably the best man in the business nowadays; Hans Zimmer. And as we are used to with the German composer, this was once again sublime and a great homage to the original. Zimmer's 2049 score can be compared to his Dunkirk score, in a way that it unsettles us from the first chord and just as the Second World War movie, it keeps us on the edges of ours seats, especially during the last hour.As for the people who are actually situated in front of the camera, they all play their parts very well. I was especially happy that Ryan Gosling's agent K was indeed the leading man and he did a very good job. I was slightly concerned that it would mostly be about Harrison Ford's Deckard, but luckily that wasn't the case. Nevertheless, Ford gives one of his best performances in years and after all the iconic roles he played once again in recent years (Han Solo, Indiana Jones) this is by far the best. The smaller but important roles are also noteworthy; Robin Wright's Lieutenant Joshi makes a fierce and convincing police chief, while the villain duo Jared Leto's Neander Wallace as the evil head of a corporation at the top of the new world order and his frightening hit-woman Luv (Sylvia Hoeks) are also very impressive. Last but not least, Ana de Armas is also very good as Joi, K's girlfriend (even if she does remind me a lot of Scarlet Johansson in 'Her' and slightly of Alicia Vikander in 'Ex Machina', but maybe that's something Villeneuve did that on purpose and wanted to pay homage to these recent but also very good science-fiction movies).That said, Villeneuve will receive most of the credit, as he should. For unlike most of Hollywood's blockbusters nowadays, he doesn't simply deliver us a spectacle with some nice effects or a reboot of the original, but he picks up the threads where Scott left, which was a monumental task, for the original 'Blade Runner' is one of the most impressive and iconic movies ever made. 2049 continues on the same topics raised by the original, making the sequel worth the 35-year long wait; it goes further with what was proposed in the first installment, enriching one another. It is possible that one day a third installment could be made, but that is only if any director will ever find the courage to make another 'Blade Runner', for the bar is raised incredibly high. I believe that in time, 'Blade Runner 2049' will just as the original one, grow into a cult movie, and rightfully so, for it is its own movie, but, just as the original, a visually remarkable, achingly human sci-fi masterpiece. I am not going to say more about it, because the studio has been unusually insistent in its pleas to critics and the first movie viewers not to reveal any plot points, but I am glad they did. Even if I could go on and on about the movie and the difference between replicants and humans (or is there really much of a difference, after all?) the less you know the better, because 2049 feels at its best when it surprises (which is one of Villeneuve's greatest strengths). This is a movie best experienced on the biggest screen in your cinema; trust me, it will be worth your while. As for me, I will most likely try and make some free time in my schedule for the coming days, 'cause I want to go the cinema again, guess what I'm gonna watch..."
"Admittedly, I did not enjoy the prospects of a Blade Runner sequel, since I considered the first installment to be a one-off story, for which a sequel would ultimately harm.Unfortunately, this movie did just that. I did not like the plot at all, which I considered both ridiculous and tacky, despite being drenched in massive amounts of self-importance. The visuals were nice, and lots of care seemed to be made to maintain the original's style. The problem is, again, the story, narrative, etc. I'd say it's worth a watch, but I don't believe many will return for a second viewing"
"1- Tons of plotholes.
2- Blade runner's (the character) mystique ruined
3- Ridley's work and characters from the original dumped.
4- No character development.
5- Nothing explained
6- So clearly leaving door open for yet.another.sequel.
7- hell is heaven. in the planet left behind there is good food, cool tech, jobs, pretty women, threesomes, nice legs, prostitutes et cetra et cetra"
"Plenty of raving reviews, but I do not agree with the masterpiece verdict by many reviewers. The original was complex, but yet simple to understand, and as the plot unfolds, the story engages you through the film. This sequel looks fantastic , and the performances are great, yet something is missing. A straight forward plot, with a flowing script would have a made a huge difference. Sitting through 150 minutes of drama, yet struggling to make sense of it, seems to me that the maker failed in the business of screen story telling. I was disappointed and found the first film so much better than this big budget fare. Dalton trumbo please help us as today's science fiction big budget films are in the main failing to be anything like as entertaining as they should be. Better script writers & screen story tellers are so important,yet it seems that simplicity is being substituted by muddled messy big budget effects, all for the sake of being so much cleverer than the dumb audience. Alfred Hitchcock knew how to make a film, a pity a few of these over hyped directors, don't have a rethink on what it takes to entertain an audience . I am more than ever mistrusting so called master reviewers !!!!"
Would it kill you to not make a sequel for once?Some will notice that the movie does not need to exist. And surely that is obvious. But still they could have used better pacing and more logic.I did find a starlet as the woman was superbly pretty.
"In the ongoing tradition of Harrison Ford's Action heroes of the 1980's turning out to be really terrible dads, we have Blade Runner 2049, the sequel to 1982's Blade Runner. We meet a replicant cop named K who is of a new variety that doesn't rebel unlike those bad ones in the movies. So he tracks down a Runaway Nexus 8, even though in the original movie, we were assured that Nexus 8's only had 4 year lifespans. During the course of this, they discover the bones of Sean Young's character from the original movie, along with the realization she had given birth. Our hero also has a relationship with a Hologram Girl for some reason. I guess so he is sad when she gets deleted later in the movie. If you are watching this movie to see Harrison Ford reprise his role as Deckard, you don't get to see him walking around like someone's confused grandpa until 2 hours into an interminably long movie. (Seriously, I feel bad for Ford. Why does he do this to himself?)So they want to find the child of Deckard and Rachel because this is a replicant that can reproduce, which is supposedly more efficient than just growing them, for some reason. They say they need more replicants to colonize the outer colonies, but of course, there are plenty of people living in squalor, including a child labor sweatshop. I can't emphasize enough how long, boring, uninteresting this movie was. It's like they watched the original and still had no idea what made it a good movie."
"Blade Runner 2049 is the sequel to the 1982 sci-fi classic Blade Runner. Directed by Denis Villeneuve (Arrival, Sicario) and once again based on Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, it successfully recaptures just about everything excellent about the original and is a superb sequel to one of the greatest and most important science fiction films of all time.Thirty years after the events of the first film, LAPD Officer K (Ryan Gosling) works as a Blade Runner, retiring old rogue replicants (artificial humans) hiding out around the Los Angeles area. One day while on a job, K discovers a long buried secret in the yard of a replicant which leads him on a journey to track down former Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), who has been missing for decades.Featuring amazing visuals and some of the most philosophical and thought-provoking themes since the original, Blade Runner 2049 is a masterpiece of science fiction and is possibly one of the greatest sequels ever made. I was transfixed the entire time, to the point where I felt that even blinking would cause me to miss something I wanted to see. The cast was brilliant as well, especially Ryan Gosling, who does a fantastic job carrying the film as its lead actor. However, perhaps best of all, is that seeing the original is not a requirement to fully understand everything that is going on, although it would probably still help to have done so beforehand. I'm almost certain that author Philip K. Dick would be proud of this film. I know I am.I rate it a very high 9.5/10"
"There's a lot to like about this movie. Ryan Gosling gives a fantastic performance, both nuanced and surprisingly emotional. The action, when there is action, is well filmed and brutal and fun to watch. The CGI is pretty much flawless, and I'm not joking when I say that while watching this movie, you'll think you're watching a real world. The film is interesting, it's well shot, well directed, it's visually stunning, it's pretty, and the score is very thrilling. But as a whole, this movie is just so god da*n boring. Look, I like slow paced movies, but this film is beyond slow paced. It's brain dead. It's literally like watching a person with no arms and legs try to crawl across a football field. I won't lie, at first I liked this slow pace because it built up a lot of tension, a lot of mystery, a lot of suspense, and I assumed that eventually the film would kick into high gear; it never did. The pace remains constant throughout the entire run time of this movie. It's excruciatingly slow. The movie is almost 3 hours long, and it feels like 6. I couldn't wait for this movie to end, I mean by the end of the movie I expected to look in the mirror and see that I aged 65 years. And also, the film is also overly convoluted. I'm not saying that this is a confusing film, because it's not; in fact, it's pretty straightforward and easy to follow. It just simply felt like this movie was convoluted for the sake of it being convoluted. At the time of watching everything felt important. I had to pee so badly the entire movie but I didn't want to get up because I felt like everything I was watching was super important. However, only after viewing do I realize that there were so many scenes that were totally unnecessary, that were there only to make the movie longer, more bloated, and more self-important.Unfortunately, there's just not much else to say. This is a simple movie, and it gets a simple review. Look, I wanted to give this a high score, but I just couldn't, and I don't understand why other people are because this movie is simply not enjoyable or entertaining. Yes, it's well made, a feast for the eyes and ears, but that doesn't make it a good film; it makes it a well directed and produced film, but not a good one."
"This film is just another average modern production. It shares the same faults and advantages as all the other films being release nowadays.It is too long. Directors start believing in themselves and banish their editors to the corner The CGI is great and improves day by day. The palette is impressive here, but the originality of the prequel is gone.Reviewers are overwhelmingly obedient when they have to be and are overly positive. Moreover, the reviews are give away the plot. going on I knew what half the story was.It is a sequel. Dick wrote one book on the topic. Why are there two films now? Hollywood is addicted to its sequels. This drug is bad for the taker, but Hollywood cannot break the habit.Not enough good looking flaunting women. These are PC times we live in, which is sad for the eyes.Movie is slow. Should they bring back intermissions? They could, but in today's busy society it will not work.This sequel was not a necessity, but it is not bad either. It just is too stereotypical for current films."
"I broke a taboo and went to see the Film Which Shouldn't Have Been Made, aka Blade Runner 2049. And regretted it.Not quite sure which bit was the worst, so I'll start from the good ones. CGI was the biggest player and reaching levels never seen before. Rachael gave me, indeed, the goose bumps. Photography was gorgeous but in many ways not comparable to the original. The 2049 version of Pris was as good as the original, and not because of CGI, which is nice. The BR1-way of nice, which had no CGI.Lots of juicy bits to take us for a wonderful trip down memory lane, but all these great bits seem to have been scripted to make a replica(-nt) of the original film. They are not hidden somewhere to let the audience spot them and delight with their discovery. Beside the cameos played by the original actors, the numerous references to the first film are a substantial part of the footage. They are not nuanced, they are slapped in the face of the public in inescapable order: car zooming over LA (check), Pris (check), origami (check), exotic animal dealer in seedy district (double check), PanAm (check), Coca-Cola billboards (check), Atari ads (check). And the list goes on.With that out of the way, let's face it, if it hadn't be for the CGI, the cameos and the plagiarism, the film had very little to offer. The soundtrack was horrid; bombastic, droning and uninspired much like Hans Zimmer's previous stuff. The repeating nods to the original soundtrack were coarse and, at the same time, they made his almost bearable. No stupid voice over of the very first BR theatrical version, but a big fat explanation right in the middle of the film, by a one-eyed replicant, in a scene that made me expect Tina Turner appear in leather clothes. Beside the gratuitous explanation, the plot is not as linear as one might expect, but it seems that all the ideas and influences have been, sort of, stitched in a hurry, cramming as much stuff as possible in a film that was already too long.The influence of ""Her"" (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709) is evident, but while Her had all the time to develop the psychological drama, in BR2049 the same ideas are badly developed, and CGI gets massively in the way, distracting from the drama.The first BR blurred the boundaries of good and evil, as much as human and artificial. In BR2049 we have the reappearance of the super villain, much like in a Marvel flick. All the good old stereotypes of Hollywood film making are back, and one is to wonder why the cavalry didn't make it for the gran finale.There are also good reasons to dislike the closing scene, which lets the audience leave the theatre with nothing to remember beside the special effects. The film should have ended right on that staircase and let us sink deep in K's existential agony. Which is amplified by its similarities to ours. But no, the scene, which is a bad copy of Roy's death (check), underlined by the same music (check), but not nearly the same pathos, is whisked aside in a hurry, and the happy ending cuts in. OK, Gosling is no Rutger Hauer, but his character had the same potential. Why did his death need to look so unimportant? BR1 led us to question what should be considered human and what is not; it shook our certainties. BR2049 seems to put that boundary firmly back in place: if you are not born, your feelings are just a delusional dream; you are a machine. Period.Given the profusion of prequels, trailers and whatnot, we had to endure, it is only to be expected a string of director's cuts. While the first Blade Runner had a history that unfolded throughout its several editions, due to its initial misunderstanding and its later rise to cult status, the repackaging of this one has probably been planned upfront, as a way to stand firmly in the shadow of the original film.While Blade Runner inspired generations, I won't be surprised if its sequel will soon be forgotten. As already written by someone else, Blade Runner 2049 looks like a flawed replicant and the only feeling you will be left with is a sense of regret for having wasted three hours of your life."
"After seeing the the sequel to the amazing and amazing first Blade Runner, i am not disappointed. But i am not impressed either. In summary, 2049 plays it's cards too close to the chest, but without the element of surprise or good main characters to back it up. So lets break this movie down shall we? Sound: 3/10 The sound is perfectly mixed.... and that's that. Otherwise it's like the new Doom soundtrack, just a bunch of bass rumbling around on top of old Vangelis lines(but probably without the vintage hardware). A few of the tracks are Psybient/Solar Fields like, which really fit into the scenes. But overall, its pretty uninspiring. Visuals: 7/10 The sets are amazing, but there is definitely something off. The first movie had some sets that were really realistic, which is what i think made the movie believable. There was dirt, glass, patches of color, mats, live candles. It is the same as the visual difference between Alien/Aliens and Prometheus, if that makes any sense. It is obvious that they tried to replicate the set pieces of the original, but it comes off as way, way to grandiose and large-scale. Pacing: 2/10 Horrible. Every scene is dragged out so long that you could walk out, cook some food and come back without missing a single important thing in the story. Sure, the first Blade Runner was slow, but it wasn't moving like a drugged sloth. To sum it up, they could have easily pushed the story into an hour long movie instead of three. Story: 4/10 This is really where they dropped the ball. The characters are so boring they might as well be extras, especially Deckers girlfriend. I didn't care about her at the start, and i didn't care about her when she died. Also, the main villain. I mean, really? What were they thinking? She is so one-dimensional, she might as well be played by Brian Thompson. And no, making her cry while she kills things does not make her more complex and believable. The villain in the first Blade Runner, played by Rutger Hauer, at least had a glowing personality. Also, some scenes and ideas are just there for shock value. You will know which ones they are. In summary: There is not one line or scene in the whole movie which is even close to the quality of the monologue at the end of the first movie."
"So, I didn't expect much from this sequel when it was announced, but since the original 'Blade Runner' is, in my opinion, one of the greatest movies ever made (if not the greatest), I had to see it anyways. As I often do, I didn't read any reviews or watch any trailers before going.So, where do we start... While not perfect, and inferior to the original, this is still a great movie. Visually it's simply stunning and the actors are all excellent. Just as importantly, or maybe even more so, like the original it combines a slow pace and fantastic ambiance to create an introspective mood and invite reflection on some important themes and issues of our time. (although, maybe, lacking a dialogue with the same power as the Roy Batty monologue at the end of the first movie).As some negative reviewers said, it is slow..... but that works well with the story and its intent to create a very clear, pervasive mood rather than to dazzle with dumb car chases, gunfights, or explosions,not to mention pushing the viewer to form his own opinions. The boringpart is subjective: for viewers who like to be challenged intellectually I'd say many action movies are a lot more boring. Nothing wrong with escapist movies, which I also enjoy when I'm in the right mood, but it doesn't change the fact that they're inherently much more predictable, superficial and formulaic. In other words, entertaining but intellectually boring. Regarding Blade Runner 2049, one disappointment, though, to be honest, was the soundtrack: aside from being too loud, it really consists mostly of weird sounds/noises etc. While they do heighten the mood at times, or fit the atmosphere, they are not really not up to the lofty standards of the photography, the action, or the direction.Also, the plot could have been a little tighter, and while the slow pace is what this movie needed, I'm not convinced it really had to be this long (or to touch on so many themes, as it does). Still, it's a fantastic, and unique, viewing experience, and even with its imperfections it does create a believable (if gloomy and depressing) dystopian vision of the future, and touches on themes that could spark endless debate and reflection. And herein lies its beauty: shallow popcorn movies will have faded from everybody's memory in weeks. A movie like Blade Runner 2049 will inspire us and challenge us,whether we agree with some of its vision or not, maybe even whether we love it or hate it, for years to come."
"I have not seen such a badly made movie in a really long time. The only thing good about this movie is the actors. who did a good job in doing what they were told to. But the story is a pathetic layering of a typical family drama projected onto flying cars that is supposed to be our future. The jest of story, we industrialize ruthlessly to shred nature and then struggle to find a human emotion within ourselves and wage a war to hold on to it. Pathetic, heard many times, over and over. I am not sure if the theme was disguised as to give a facade of art or was so poorly directed that it was not even strongly projected. Either way, it gave me headaches. And the music was so grossly out of sync with the picture, it made no sense remotely. The unnecessary loud noises had not 1% context with what was happening on screen. Ridiculously long, out of context, poor direction, senseless sound effects, sorry picture of the story. sheer torture to sit through it."
"This movie was so bad I can't put into words. I loved Blade Runner but this sequel is so bad I can no longer watch the original. Music over the top Acting nonexistent Length, felt like 6 hours,and not in a good wayAs people left the theater I saw shaking heads.Don't understand people raving about it. They must be connected to the film somehow. Save your money, watch the original and don't let this ruin it for you like it did for me"
The wife just rocks. The hooker she procures is not bad at all either. I shipped them and don't mind telling you fantasized about them when with my wife.
