"A stand-alone monument in cinema history, Stanley Kubrick's magnum opus 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is an undeniable masterpiece. 2001 not only shattered science fiction genre conventions, but gave cinema a whole new meaning. From the grandiosity of its futuristic idea to its ambitious execution, 2001 isn't concerned with entertaining us- but rather to inspire us with awe. I've never seen a person say, ""2001: A Space Odyssey? I don't think I've seen it... oh wait, the one with like, the spaceships and stuff?"", while most movies today are forgotten once the credits roll. What viewers must understand is that 2001 not the type of movie where you ""get it"" or not, nor is it designed to thrill us with flashy special effects- but as Kubrick said, is ""...intended to be an intensely subjective experience that reaches the viewer at an inner level of consciousness."" In it of itself, exploring the philosophical and scientific arenas of mankind while serving as a groundbreaking achievement both on a conceptual and technical level is a hell of an accomplishment, but to transcend the audience to a whole new dimension all in one- that's sheer genius at its highest form.At its premiere, 2001 polarized critics and audiences alike. Walkouts numbered well over 200, including Rock Hudson who asked, ""Will someone tell me what the hell this is all about?"" The New York Times remarked, ""Somewhere between hypnotic and immensely boring."" ""Superb photography major asset to confusing, long-unfolding plot,"" Newsday commented. Renowned critic Pauline Kael even went as far as calling 2001 ""trash masquerading as art"". It's understandable, though. In a time in which excitement revolving around interstellar exploration and extra-terrestrial life was everyday talk, audiences came into 2001 expecting answers. When will we reach the moon? What does the future hold? Are we alone? To their great surprise, 2001 did the paradoxical; leaving more questions to answer than answered questions.Even though the late 60s marked the height of technological optimism, Kubrick saw ahead, highlighting the potential negatives of technological advancement. Notice the contrast between how apes and humans approach the monolith. The apes approach it with dignity, respect, and mindfulness. The humans approach it with arrogance, grouping astronauts in front of the monolith to take a picture. Since the monolith represents the incomprehensible (man, with his limited senses, cannot comprehend the absence (perfect black) of color or light), Kubrick may be suggesting the manner in which we handle new information is careless and hasty, emphasized in the Clavius base briefing. Scientists discuss how to distribute this exciting news to the public, for ""if the facts were prematurely and suddenly stated without adequate preparation and conditioning"", as stated by Dr. Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester), it may cause ""cultural shock and social disorientation"". It's a significant message to the anxious people of 1968 to perceive fresh information precisely and draw conclusions logically.Yet apes are not much better. They're not willing to share food and water with their fellow apes, and with the discovery of bones as weapons, kill their own race for a puddle of water- possibly foreshadowing our own demise if we continue to advance artificial intelligence. Because like our ancestors, at heart, mankind has been and will always be selfish.Far before The Terminator (1984) or The Matrix (1999) accentuated the dangers of artificial intelligence, there was 2001. H.A.L 9000, voice played by Douglas Rain, was ingeniously crafted into one of the most terrifying villains in film history. There's something about his calm voice, unpredictability, and especially, his omniscient single red eye that's so frightening. Kubrick utilizes one of his favorite filmmaking devices to compare artificial intelligence with humans: irony. Neither Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) or Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) display much emotion throughout the film, while H.A.L, albeit a machine, exhibits some while pleading for life singing ""Daisy"" (which, by the way, is a heart-wrenching scene) and murdering his crew members. There are clear connotations of humanity's fate when H.A.L attempts to kill Frank, Dave, and the hibernating crew members. Yet H.A.L, contrast to what he may think, is not perfect. If he was incapable of miscalculating even the slightest bit, he wouldn't have gotten himself killed. Kubrick implies that artificial intelligence has not yet reached the level of annihilating the human race, but if we are not careful, they soon will.This idea coincides with the perplexing final sequence, resembling man reaching the next stage of evolution. After the famous ""Star Gate"" sequence, Dave is enlightened in a room. The setting hints at the Enlightenment Era, exquisitely decorated in 18th century style and embellished with lavish paintings and furniture. Notice how the room is solely lit through the transparent ground, establishing a heavenly environment. The eerie silence is ominous, magnifying the mystical aura that is ever so present in the timelessness of the final scene. As Dave exits his EVA pod, he watches himself age rapidly through one-point perspective. He knocks over a wine glass while eating, suggesting that man, no matter how advanced, will keep making mistakes. As he lays on his deathbed later, he reaches out to the monolith, alluding to Adam reaching out to God in Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam. After man is enlightened, he inevitably dies.A pessimistic ending? No. Man is then transported back to Earth as a ""Space Baby"", an infinitely more advanced race, marking a new age of evolution. A masterful stroke of genius, Kubrick ends hopeful, giving us another chance to improve on our mistakes. Or is it hopeful? Is he implying that civilization is evolving badly? Or is he suggesting that civilization will NEVER evolve? There are multiple interpretations of the ending, and it's a question for you to answer.There is such a great deal of symmetry in 2001's composition throughout the film, possibly suggesting the equilibrium present in the universe. The painstakingly slow pace also compliments the exactness of its harmony, practically forcing you to admire its artistry. While Andrei Tarkovsky's work would breathe with such organic and poetic beauty, Kubrick's artificial visual fluidity mesmerizes the eye with meticulous precision and thoroughness. Each shot, averaging 13.6 seconds, possesses a sense of purity and perfection that can only be achieved through the medium of cinema.But of course, it's impossible not to talk about 2001 without mentioning one aspect. The visual effects are so unanimously praised that it's hopeless to even try to describe how groundbreaking and influential they were. Hopeless. I can talk for days about the impeccable zero-gravity effects, clever rotating sets, fastidiously constructed spaceships, the brilliant use of slit-scan photography for the psychedelic Star Gate sequence, or how it pioneered the use of front projection with retroreflective matting, but what's the point? You don't need me to appreciate 2001's immaculate visuals.Finally, the choice of music is outstanding. Originally, Alex North was appointed to score the film, but Kubrick turned it down in post-production. Critic Roger Ebert explains it perfectly, ""North's (rejected) score, which is available on a recording, is a good job of film composition, but would have been wrong for 2001 because, like all scores, it attempts to underline the action-to give us emotional cues. The classical music chosen by Kubrick exists outside the action. It uplifts. It wants to be sublime; it brings a seriousness and transcendence to the visuals.""""But why all the slow parts?"" asks the one who fell asleep. Primarily, to establish tone. Unlike the low-budget commercial science fiction movies preceding it, 2001 was meant to be taken seriously. It symbolizes a quest for whether God exists or not, challenges humanity's fate, and questions evolution as a whole. If each shot's average length was two seconds and there was some sappy romantic love subplot mixed in between, the whole film would've been a mess. Space isn't fast-paced like we see in most movies. Space is slow-really, really, slow. The addition of three minutes and seventeen seconds of a black screen in the beginning was also pure genius, a signal for casual moviegoers to get out of the theater now and save your time.Thankfully, its ingenuity was gradually recognized, and it's now widely regarded as one of the greatest and influential films of all time. It stands at an impressive #6 on the BFI ""Sight and Sound"" Critics' poll in 2012, ties for 2nd in the Director's poll, places 15th on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies, and tops the Online Film Critics Society list of ""greatest science-fiction films of all time"".2001: A Space Odyssey breaks almost every rule there is in filmmaking. The first half drags, the dialogue is unnatural, the static camera creates no visual interest, there are barely any emotional punches, characters are monotonous, and none of the protagonists, if there even are, have dimensionality, arcs or epiphanies. Nonetheless, it's transcendental and sublime, awe-inspiring and thought-provoking, visually revolutionary, technically impeccable, monumentally imaginative, substantially rich, and way ahead of its time, thriving with unparalleled originality and ambition.Only a few films will live forever. 2001 is one of them. Happy 50th birthday."
"Sometimes reading the user comments on IMDB fills me with despair for the species.  For anybody to dismiss 2001: A Space Odyssey as ""boring"" they must have no interest in science, technology, philosophy, history or the art of film-making.  Finally I understand why most Hollywood productions are so shallow and vacuous - they understand their audience.Thankfully, those that cannot appreciate Kubrick's accomplishment are still a minority.  Most viewers are able to see the intelligence and sheer virtuosity that went into the making of this epic.  This is the film that put the science in ""science fiction"", and its depiction of space travel and mankind's future remains unsurpassed to this day.  It was so far ahead of its time that humanity still hasn't caught up.2001 is primarily a technical film.  The reason it is slow, and filled with minutae is because the aim was to realistically envision the future of technology (and the past, in the awe inspiring opening scenes).  The film's greatest strength is in the details.  Remember that when this film was made, man still hadn't made it out to the moon... but there it is in 2001, and that's just the start of the journey.  To create such an incredibly detailed vision of the future that 35 years later it is still the best we have is beyond belief - I still can't work out how some of the shots were done.  The film's only notable mistake was the optimism with which it predicted mankind's technological (and social) development.  It is our shame that the year 2001 did not look like the film 2001, not Kubrick's.Besides the incredible special effects, camera work and set design, Kubrick also presents the viewer with a lot of food for thought about what it means to be human, and where the human race is going.  Yes, the ending is weird and hard to comprehend - but that's the nature of the future.  Kubrick and Clarke have started the task of envisioning it, now it's up to the audience to continue.  There's no neat resolution, no definitive full stop, because then the audience could stop thinking after the final reel.  I know that's what most audiences seem to want these days, but Kubrick isn't going to let us off so lightly.I'm glad to see that this film is in the IMDB top 100 films, and only wish that it were even higher.  Stanley Kubrick is one of the very finest film-makers the world has known, and 2001 his finest accomplishment. 10/10."
"For all those bewildered by the length and pace of this film (""like, why does he show spaceships docking for, like, 15 minutes?""), here's a word you might want to think about:Beauty. Beauty is an under-rated concept. Sure, you'll often see nice photography and so on in films. But when did you last see a film that contains beauty purely for the sake of it? There is a weird belief among cinemagoers that anything which is not plot or character related must be removed. This is depressing hogwash. There is nothing wrong with creating a beautiful sequence that has nothing to do with the film's plot. A director can show 15 minutes of spaceships for no reason than that they are beautiful, and it is neither illegal nor evil to do so.   '2001' requires you to watch in a different way than you normally watch films. It requires you to relax. It requires you to experience strange and beautiful images without feeling guilty that there is no complex plot or detailed characterization. Don't get me wrong, plots and characters are good, but they're not the be-all and end-all of everything. There are different KINDS of film, and to enjoy '2001' you must tune your brain to a different wavelength and succumb to the pleasure of beauty, PURE beauty, unfettered by the banal conventions of everyday films.  ""All art is quite useless"" -  Oscar Wilde."
"A review I have put off for far too long....Bluntly, 2001 is one of the best science-fiction films made to date, if not the very best. Stanley Kubrick was a genius of a film maker and this is one of his very best works. And although it is misunderstood by many, and respectively underrated, it is considered one of the best films of all time and I'll have to agree. Back in 1968, no one had done anything like this before, and no one has since. It was a marvel of a special effects breakthrough back then, and seeing how the effects hold up today, it is no wonder as to why. The film still looks marvelous after almost forty years! Take note CGI people. Through the use of large miniatures and realistic lighting, Kubrick created some of the best special effects ever put on celluloid. This aspect alone almost single-handedly created the chilling void of the space atmosphere which is also attributed to the music and realistic sound effects. I can't think of another film where you can't here anything in space, like it is in reality. Not only is the absence of sound effects in space realistic, it is used cleverly as a tool to establish mood, and it works flawlessly.Aside from the magnificent display of ingenious special effects, there are other factors that play a part in establishing the feel of the film. The music played, all classical, compliment what the eyes are seeing and make you feel the significance of man's journey through his evolution from ape to space traveler.The story, while seemingly simple, is profound. Sequentially, several mysterious black monoliths are discovered and basically trigger certain events integral to the film. What are they? Where did they come from? What do they do? These are all questions one asks oneself while watching the story develop and is asked to find his own way. While most come away with a general idea of what took place in the story, each individual will have to decide what it means to them. Any way one decides to answer these question results in profound solutions. It's not left entirely up to interpretation, but in some aspects it is. Experience it for more clarification. The end result is quite chilling, no matter your personal solution.While it is a long film, and sometimes slows down, it has to be in order to accurately portray the journey of man. It's not a subject that would have faired well in a shorter film, faster paced feature. Those with short attention spans need not apply.Last but not least, is the epitome of a remorseless antagonist, HAL 9000, the computer. Never has a machine held such a chilling screen presence. Which reminds me, for a film with such profound ambition and execution, there is surprisingly little dialogue. Another sign of Kubrick's genius.All in all, one of the best films made to date and one of the very best science fiction films made. A personal favorite. Everyone must see this film at least once.Very highly recommended."
"Instead of writing a paragraph, I'll give four good reasons why 2001 is  the greatest cinema experience of all time:  1) It is a visual Odyssey that could only be told on the big screen.  The special effects that won Kubrick his only Oscar are the most  stunning effects before that age of Jurassic Park and T2. They allow  Kubrick to give an accurate (or at least are the most accurate)  depiction of space travel to date. The silence that fills the space  scenes not only serves its purpose as accurate science, but also adds  to the mood of the film (to be discussed in a later point with HAL).  The fact that Kubrick shot the moon scenes before the Apollo landing is  a gutsy yet fulfilling move. Many have said that upon its original  release, it was a favorite ""trip"" movie. I can think of no other movie  that has such amazing visuals for its time and even of all time (sorry  Phantom Menace fans!)  2) Kubrick's directing style is terrific. As in all his films, Kubrick  likes to use his camera as means to delve into the psychology of his  characters and plots. His camera is not as mobile as other greats, such  as Scorsese, but instead sits and watches the narrative unfold. Faces  are the key element of a Kubrick film. Like classic movies, such as M  and Touch of Evil, Kubrick focuses on the characters' faces to give the  audience a psychological view-point. Even he uses extreme close-ups of  HAL's glowing red ""eye"" to show the coldness and determination of the  computerizd villain. I could go on, but in summation Kubrick is at the  hieght of his style.  3) HAL 9000 is one of the most villainous characters in film history. I  whole-heartedly agree with the late Gene Siskle's opinion of HAL 9000.  Most of this film takes place in space. Through the use of silence and  the darkness of space itself, a mood of isolation is created. Dave and  his crewmen are isolated between earth and jupiter, with nowhere to  escape. Combine this mood with the cold, calculated actions of HAL 9000  and you have the most fearful villain imaginable. I still, although  having see this film several times, feel my chest tighten in a  particular scene.  4) The controversial  ending of 2001 always turns people away from this film. Instead of  trying to give my opinion of the what it means and what my idea of  2001's meaning in general is, I'd like to discuss the fact that the  ending serves to leave the movie open-ended. Kubrick has stated that he  inteded to make 2001 open for discussion. He left its meaning in the  hands of the viewer. By respecting the audience's intelligence, Kubrick  allowed his movie to be the beginning, not the end, of a meaningful  discussion on man's past, present, and future. The beauty of 2001 is  that the ending need not mean anything deep, it can just be a purely  plot driven explanation and the entire movie can be viewed as an  entertaining journey through space. No other movie, save the great  Citizen Kane, leaves itself open to discussion like 2001. It is truly  meant to be a surreal journey that involves not only the eye but the  mind. Instead of waiting in long lines for the Phantom Menace, rent a  widescreen edition of 2001 and enjoy the greatest cinematic experience."
"Stanley Kubrick's '2001 A Space Odyssey is the kind of film that viewers really have to prepare for. Well, thats what I tell people before they devote their precious time to watch sci fi's most admired entry. 2001 opens to desolate plains in prehistoric times. This 15 minute sequence demonstrates how ape-like creatures can use the bones of an animal to kill a tribal rival. During all this, a bizzare alien monolith appears and causes bewilderment amongst the primates. Just as the bone is hurled into the air to signify celebration, the film jumps thousands of years into the future as a space station orbits the solar system. We are introduced to Dr. Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester) who is travelling to the moon with the task of exploring a black monolith that has been found beneath the lunar surface. The monolith starts to beam a heavy transmission toward Jupiter and 18 months later astronauts Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) are en route to find answers. Like many of Kubrick's films, we see a lack of emotion and personality from his characters. But in 2001, it exhibits the fact that we may not be superior to the apes, but having access to better equiptment certainly gives the illusion that we are. The most impressive character is a computer named HAL. He is inquisitive, shows empathy and expresses concern toward the activities of the two pilots aboard the space ship Discovery. The actions of HAL that follow are etched into film history, im sure you have heard many impressions of the rouge computer. Dave confronts the monolith, transporting him into an unknown dimension, ageing him beyond belief, before morphing into a shining fetus appearing in space. Its questionable which segment of 2001 is the most memorable, Kubrick merges together an impeccable ensemble of music and stirring visuals to create a movie that doesnt play by the rules that other films adhere to. 2001 is a puzzle that begs to be solved, the ambiguity only adding to the overall brilliance, each and every frame worthy of a discussion, if not a debate."
"I felt the need to review this movie after reading some reviews from other users, simply because I agreed with all. Those who love it, those who hate it, those who enjoyed it, all of them. And the reason is simple: everything they say makes sense to me. I watched the movie for the first time about 10 years ago, and watched it again last night. It still doesn't make perfect sense to me. I mean, the story is absent, the characters don't really get through you, and the ending...who gets that ending?? #SPOILERS# BELOWThe end makes no sense to me... The psychedelic travel, the space child... Maybe I'm just plain stupid, but spending two and a half hours looking at space, slooowww space, and in the end just watch a man in bed, then a baby in a bubble, no explanations, no nothing... Truly, if someone got it and has the hability to explain it to me without calling it ""art"" or whatever, simply explain it to me, I would be very thankful, not kidding. Maybe that way I would be able to enjoy it next time I watch it, maybe ten years from now.That been said, why would I rate it a 7...? I believe when I watch a movie for the first time, I should put myself at the time, the era, the social paradigm, the movie was released. And this movie is cleary ahead of its time. Note, that I am talking about the visual effects, and the general idea of the movie. This movie clearly marked an era, a filmmaker, visual effects and the idea of what space was like. For that it deserves a high rating, maybe the highest. Not to mention the hype the movie STILL causes. We still can't reach an understanding...is it a masterpiece, is it overrated. The only way to really be able to discuss it and form your own opinion is to watch it, so the movie reaches its goal: to be watched and debated. A blockbuster rarely does this, we just watch them to get some good action scenes, visual effects, whatever, but when a filmmaker creates a movie that creates hype, controversy and most importantly, a vision of the future, he is creating a cult movie...a classic. To sum up, as I said in the beginning, when i read people calling it a classic, a masterpiece, I have to agree, but I also agree with those who say its overrated and boring...For me both sentences are true."
"I write this review just after hearing of Stanley Kubrick's death. It's a great loss, and I write about 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, because I feel it is the consummate Kubrick film, the one he will be most remembered for. It is a picture like no other, not only revolutionizing science fiction, but changing the way films are conceptualized. It was probably America's first 'art' film and has inspired the likes of George Lucas and countless other writers and directors.Aside from its visual greatness, the reason the film spawns so much discussion and analysis is because so many people have so many different interpretations of it. Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, his co-writer, had a vision, but we have never really found out what was going through their minds. Of course, the skinny on its 'message' is how technology of the future will take over humanity and decide the course of our lives unless we are careful. 2001's ending is one of hope, a version of our rebirth through the star-child's flight back to earth. It is meaningless to many, but discerning filmgoers will understand.Although 2001 does not have the wicked, dark humor of DR. STRANGELOVE or CLOCKWORK ORANGE, or contain strong, eccentric characters that filled his earlier works like PATHS OF GLORY or SPARTACUS, I still feel he would've liked to be remembered most for this. If anything, HAL will be his most memorable character, dangerous, murderous, and artificial. It was a half-decade in the making at a time when Hollywood was still churning out dull musicals and just waking up to the New Wave of French and Italian cinema. Kubrick was a maverick director who made great films on his own terms, his own time, and for everyone else to marvel at. He will be missed."
"I did and I lost two and a half hours of my life that I can never regain again.I honestly have no idea what the critics and fans see in this movie. And that's not because I can't appreciate ""art"". I love a good film with profound messages, brilliant cinematography, and great directing.This film just isn't one of them.My main complaint about this film is that it's so horribly slow-paced, to the point of boring its audience to death. On the other hand, sequences of dialog go by too quickly and there's not enough exposition to let people who haven't read the book know what's going on (My mother had mercy on me and explained everything before I watched it). Would it have killed them to hire a narrator? At least for the beginning and the end? Let me break it down for you: (Spoilers throughout) For the first two minutes you are treated to a black screen with no music, waiting for the actual movie to begin.For the following minute and a half, you see several pictures of sunrises and savanna landscapes. Like the audience couldn't figure out how to set the scene unless they saw the establishing shot three or four times.The next eleven minutes are occupied with the grunting monkeys. They fight, see the monolith, fight some more, pommel things with a bone. Supposedly they are prehistoric men whose evolution is being influenced by the monolith's singing. Not that you could tell if you hadn't read the book.*Finally* we get into space. Only to be subjected to twelve minutes of ships slowly spinning to the Blue Danube Waltz (A pretty quick-tempo-ed waltz as I understand, yet here it feels absolutely agonizing). At last we get some innocuous dialog and rather cryptic exposition about the government not letting people land on the moon. We are left to wonder about this for fourteen more minutes of Blue Danube and spinning ships and neat camera tricks with anti-gravity.Next comes four minutes of watching a ship travel over the surface of the moon and dock at a space station. We get a little more exposition in a board room scene that follows. Then we're back outside traveling at a snail's pace over the moon. A second monolith is revealed, again filling our ears with that horrible ringing (I had no idea that was an actual piece of music!). The monolith does its little light show and then the plot jumps forward.*Seven* minutes of watching the ship to Jupiter travel. By this point in time my brains had turned into mush. Could it be moving any slower? Maybe it's ""realistic"" to portray it as such, but we still don't need to see five or six different shots of the same thing to grasp the concept of its ""realism"". Let me tell you about this ""realism"" thing; I cheered when the secondary astronaut character died. Not because I'm a sadist and like watching people die, but because after five minutes I was just so annoyed at the sound of his darn breathing! I'm supposed to care about this character, feel when he dies! Instead I found myself waiting for blissful silence whatever way it came.Anyway, now we get to the most interesting part of the film-the part with HAL. Forget Dave the stick-of-wood protagonist. The real star of the show is that coldly impersonal, chillingly villainous, ruthlessly merciless bad guy of a computer. He's great. And the ""Open the pod bay doors"" sequence is wonderful. But it's too short. And it's not long before the director once again lapses into too-long goings on.Four minutes for HAL to die. And die he does. Slowly, painfully, losing intelligence with every minute, voice getting lower and slower, singing ""Daisy, Daisy"", all with a low and constant hissing that becomes just as annoying as the heavy breathing.Seven minutes of flying colors as Dave enters the monolith. Seven. I could FEEL my brains melting and dripping out of my ears! Seven full minutes of absolutely nothing but some guy's whacked out psychedelic version of space travel, again with that thrice-cursed chorus! We got the idea at the beginning of the sequence! Why drag it out so long? Unless he wanted to make LSD users go psychotic and have flashbacks.I'm not even going to try to explain the ending, mostly because I don't quite get it myself. Supposedly he's in an alien research laboratory and they're teaching him deep and profound things while he watches himself getting older and older and then they send him back to earth as some kind of cosmic celestial space baby. None of this comes across in the film. For all you know, it's just a sequence of images with no purpose or plot whatsoever. A lot of the movie felt that way.The first time I tried watching this movie I gave up halfway through. The second time I suffered through this sore excuse for a film, it was to help my sister time the sequences to see how long they lasted. It's that boring.Call this crummy film ""art"" if you wish. I wouldn't. I've seen more interesting ""art"" in the local museum. And I am never subjecting myself to this kind of suffering ever again."
"Mankind's Self awakening is the theme of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", a process that unfolds along a space-time continuum. We ""see"" our primordial past, and we ""infer"" a cosmic future. The powers of intuition thus become the doors of perception, in our ongoing collective journey.From this transcendental perspective, a conventional, egocentric plot seems superfluous. Our frenzied conflicts and self-important dialogue are consumed in evolutionary change, and are irrelevant in a cosmos that is vast beyond comprehension. It's a tough lesson for a vain and aggressive species. Not surprising then that some of us huff and puff about the film's slowness and minimal story. For perceptive viewers, the remuneration is an inspirational sense of wonder and awe.In this film, which is mostly visual, geometric symbols guide our intuition. Circles and arcs represent nature. Right angles represent conscious intelligence. Some people think the sleek, black monolith is a Von Neumann probe. Maybe. Without doubt, the monolith is a visual metaphor for an extraterrestrial intelligence whose physical form is never shown. Mystery is more profound than explanation.""2001 ... "" is unique among films in content and scope. The cinematography is out-of-this-world, the special and visual effects are breathtaking, and the classical music is sublime. I rarely use the word ""masterpiece"" to describe a movie. But Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is art in the highest sense, like Leonardo da Vinci's ""Mona Lisa"", or Vincent Van Gogh's ""The Starry Night""."
"There are two schools of thought about 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.  One, is that it is the greatest science-fiction epic ever made. This is supported by those who claim to understand the complexities involved and leading up the Star Child ending. The others, like myself, find it as absorbing as watching paint dry on woodwork.The musical background is glorious, the colors are dazzling, and there's an interesting use of HAL as a villainous computer. Beyond that, there is nothing the least bit interesting about the human characters (trite dialogue and no personality or warmth to any of the individuals), the pace is unbelievably slow (so the intellectually gifted can philosophize on the mysteries of space), and the payoff at the end leaves you either breathless with enlightenment or convinced that you have watched three hours of nothingness.I had the same letdown feeling when I watched THE CLOCKWORK ORANGE, so your like or dislike of this movie is purely dependent on personal taste. Intellectuals will take the position that you are a mentally challenged clod if you dare disagree with their elevated opinion of the movie--so be aware that this is not conventional story-telling in any sense whatsoever and only for those who admire Stanley Kubrick's way with unlikely cinematic material."
"I spent many a sleepless night after watching 2001. Not only because of the psychological horror (of which 2001 is a masterpiece) but also because of the way it brought me (a restless soul) some clarity to the way I observe the universe. It changed my way of thinking in a very profound way. And after reading the novel (by Arthur C. Clarke) I found myself once again inspired (a writer as I am) by the level of imagination.The Space Odyssey is not something one can just ""go and see"". One has to be ready for it, or it cannot be understood. In fact I don't think it can be understood at all, at least not all of it at once. It is a philosophical journey to the infinite and beyond, a masterpiece of it's genre and still after 32 years technically quite impressive all the way to the powerful musical soundtrack featuring 'Also spracht Zarathustra' by Richard Strauss and 'Blue Danube' by Johann Strauss.Take all the time you want, but eventually you are going to have to see this film. If it can bring some order and understanding to the universe of a struggling artist like me, it can certainly do it for you as well.Or maybe I'm just plain crazy..."
"This movie is certainly one of the greatest films ever made. It is a story told in a steady pace, told mostly not by words but by cinematic means of expression. Perfect blend of spectacular special effects and classical music bring to life creations of human imagination in both realistic and poetical way. The story itself is quite simple at a first glance. As the title implies, there is an archetypal journey, a motive repeated for thousands of years. This motive was always used not only to depict a trip in space and time, and beyond, but also had rich philosophic meaning. The film is a poetical contemplation of most exciting eternal questions. It is not just an odyssey of a person; it is an odyssey of our species. The film is great by itself, yet, in my case, the impression from it will always be mingled with that from the book. I've read it at the age of 10, really not thinking about problems like 'what is the relationship between evolution of humankind and development of human morality'. But the impression was great enough to make me fall for entire genre of science fiction.The day I learned '2001' got only special effects Oscar and was not even nominated for the Best Picture was the day when 'Academy Award' completely became two words meaning nothing to me."
"""200l: A Space Odyssey"" is a supremely intriguing space-travel journey with a profound look at mankind's future... It is one of the very few great films of our times... It gives us something to think, talk and argue... It wonders about our importance in the universe and ignites our imagination and curiosity... It inspires us to dig for insights...As a science fiction fantasy, it is one of the most original films ever made... Kubrick's camera dances to the ""Blue Danube"" with planets floating exuberantly through the light years... It's an experience in the poetry of motion, a rich statement to the power of cinema...But ""2001"" reveals that it's not really a science fiction film after all... It's, instead, a philosophical enigma, a magnificent meditation on man's place in the grand scheme of things, and a quest to understand ourselves by knowing all else...""2001"" is a unique film about man's evolution told in almost subliminal terms... The people in this classic science-fiction epic hardly matter... Kubrick relates a chronology in images of thingsthe mountains, the desert, the technology, the space capsule, the computer named HAL (who is more interesting than the humans), and the time warp... The final landing scene is the very hallmark of cinematic genius...As a terror story, too, it is a towering achievement (not on the same scream-inducing level as Hitchcock's ""Psycho""), but in an innocent and far more haunting way...The film uses invisible but powerful forces to manipulate the plot but perhaps the most overwhelming one is the picture's vision of man... In Kubrick's fantasy, the Golden Age of man was a neglected instant between a man-ape's exaltation at discovering the first weapon and a nuclear-powered spaceship floating in a graceful orbit around the Earth... Man has indeed evolved!As a spectacle ""2001"" assaults the mind, eye and ear, with stimulating images and suggestions... We are surrounded by a totally believable futuristic environment... The film is filled with brilliant sequences and extraordinary moments: The first interesting minutes in which the story of the apes is told visually, without a single line of dialog; the zero-gravity toilet with its great list of instructions; the stewardess defying gravity by walking the walls calmly upside down; the frightening moment when we realize that HAL is reading the astronauts lips; the magical alignments of Sun, Moon, and Earth; the ""Starchild"" returning home to charm the orb...""2001"" is filled with poetic imagery: the view of the Sun rising over the Earth; the tossing of the bone into the air in slow motion; the slow images of the giant spaceship revolving in a cosmic ballet...""2001"" is also a work of great visual acuity... It allows us to view more than the mystery of existence and destiny implicit in every man... Its end troubles many viewers as they demand clarity where there can only be mystery... They insist upon an answer where there can only be a question... Every viewer had a different explanation of the mysterious end of Kubrick's film But for those who can accept mysticism, the climax is deeply moving..."
"2001 is one of those movies where, if you don't like it, you are told that you don't 'get it' and need to look at the deeper meaning and symbolism. You're told that you clearly have a slow attention span, and just want to see sex, explosions, and have the plot handed to you on a platter.Let's break down the movie shall we? Three minutes of blackness, with something that sounds like a dying hippo in the background. Then we get the opening credits. A minute of fascinating shots of the Savannah. Then a bunch of monkeys find a black rock and start killing things with bones. Cut to the first of many 20-minute shots of ships doing things while the 'Blue Danube' plays in the background. A bunch of pointless dialogue, and a group of moon scientists find another monolith.Cut to a spaceship that's too long for the crew complement--three sleeping people, two people named Dave and Frank, who have only slightly more personality than the stiffs in hibernation. And then there's HAL, the 'perfect' supercomputer who runs the ship. Predictably, he snaps and starts breaking the First Law of Robotics. Now this is something that has potential. An evil, coldly ruthless super-mind who controls the surrounding environment and can predict your every move. And what does he do? He lets one guy float into space and turns off the hibernation machines so the three sleeping guys die, leaving Dave floating in a pod. He simply uses the airlock, puts on a spacesuit, and turns HAL off--agonizingly slowly. Then, apparently, there's some psychedelic 'evolution' at Jupiter.Here's the movie with the pauses taken out: Apes see monolith, kill things. Scientists find moon monolith. HAL kills people. HAL dies; Dave gets a prerecorded message, and evolves at Jupiter.This is not me 'not getting it.' This is me being bored to tears by long stretches of absolutely nothing. Sure, it's realistic, but I find I have no reason to care. No matter the message, no movie can be good without being entertaining. Frankly, every character could be replaced with Keanu Reeves, and nothing would change."
"Like a Circle around the human condition, 2001 starts at the beginning, skips the middle, and proceeds to the ending, right back where we started. Noting the weakness of words compared to image(s), Kubrick wisely dispenses with dialogue, preferring the power and essence of the scenery, and allowing the intelligence of the audience to do the deciphering.  Or not, depending on the audience.A monolith in cinematic history, 2001 is a high water mark of direction, execution, and achievement.  If one considers the ambition of the film (a film about everything), and the measure of success the film achieved to that end, a very sound argument for this being the greatest of all films can be made."
"I'm always surprised, given that the famous title track of 2001 is called ""Also sprach Zarathustra"", that nobody (nobody I've read, anyway) has noted the parallels between the movie and Nietzsche's famous work, ""Also sprach Zarathustra"". The idea of man's rebirth into a star child; an infant form of an indescribably more advanced being, is an explicit part of N.'s ""Zarathustra""; there is a prominent passage called ""On how a camel becomes a lion, and a lion becomes a child"", in which N. describes the first incarnation of the overman as a child, transcending both the ascetic, altruistic side of man (the camel; always asking to bear more weight) and the rapacious, brutish, will-to-power side of man (the lion). The fact that the song plays during the star child sequence can hardly be coincidence. And also, Zarathustra said that ""man is a rope tied between beasts and the overman."" The structure of the movie fits that description: a brief history of man as beast, until we become truly man by mastering weapons and acquiring reason, then a long sequence about man (the rope, as it were), and then a brief glimpse of the overman. The inscrutability of how these transformations occurred, and the suggestion that an external force caused them, is also Nietzschean; in ""Zarathustra"", he makes it pretty clear that he doesn't have a clue how people are going to be able to enact these changes themselves and suggests that we will have to depend on an outsider (Zarathustra) to show us how to ""go under"". Bowman's psychedelic sequence at the near-end could be seen as Kubrick's best 1960's-style attempt at depicting the mystical ""going under"".I know these parallels are pretty broad, and almost certainly have been noted elsewhere despite the fact that I have not personally seen it. But I just wanted to mention them, if for no other reason than to try to dispel the myth that Nietzsche was ultimately a gloomy philosopher. Few people find the ending of 2001 to be gloomy, and it is in my opinion, explicitly and unmistakeably Nietzschean. The case could certainly be made that 2001 is above all a dramatization of ""Zarathustra"" updated for the modern age. Feel free to disregard the outright snobbishness of my tying everything to Nietzsche."
"A whimsical, often spectacular view of a future in which advances in technology dominate the world. It is well shot and although slow-moving it is intense and enjoyable throughout. The featuring of classical music to establish atmosphere works brilliantly; it provides a feeling of awe, mystery and intrigue  the same aura that Walt Disney worked in creating 'Fantasia'. The special effects, both sound and visual, are still spellbinding by the standards of today's technology. Aside from the technical pluses of the film, it stands strong as it is one of not many films out there that has something important to say about humankind, and where the human race is heading in terms of our increasing reliance on machines and our unquenchable thirst to discover. Despite an ending that is hard to understand, it is even harder to overlook this film a true cinema classic."
"I normally keep my movie thoughts to myself but this movie affected me to the point of voicing myself out.Movies are typically evaluated via (i) more/less objective attributes (plot, ideas, action, cinematography, etc.) and (ii) emotional impressions they leave. While the latter is extremely personal and diverse, some convergence can be achieved in the former. Unfortunately, this piece greatly fails in it: no plot, no original ideas, no action, horrible cinematography, and a very repetitive soundtrack. As far as the emotional impression goes: well, in my case, it gave me a highly unpleasant aftertaste: a very pretentious schizophrenic nightmare...Why is it so overrated then? I'd hypothesize that it is for the same reason as in the case of Malevich's ""Black Square"". When one sees something a piece of ""art"" of that type, there seem to be two typical reactions: (i) ""There is nothing there, it is junk."" and (ii) ""There is nothing there but it must be great because everyone else thinks it's great. Then it must be an art."" So what created this mob fame effect for this movie? I don't know for sure but it might have been the big names of S.Kubrick and A.Clark. Once such a ""snowball"" starts rolling down the hill and picks up the momentum, it is more difficult to stop it than to roll with it.Please trust your own independent feelings. Things don't become better because a million of other people say they are brilliant. Cheers."
"I read some of the last critics and was astonished, that ratings for this movie are either very high or very low, which shows that these people weren't critic at all. I had a great deal of expectations when I watched this movie. Many friends said it is superb and I like all the other Kubrick movies I watched so far. But yeah. First of all the complete movie is filmed with a very keen eye on details. The ape costumes for example are great and the space vessels seem very realistic. The effects are much ahead of its time and are still remarkable today. But there is much missing. After the initial ape scene, which has some great shots the really boring part begins. Wee see spaceships with Strauss' Danube waltz in the background. It is pretty, for about 5 minutes, but after it is just boring. The music keeps repeating and all is very very slow. Some of the former critics say that you have to appreciate the beauty in it. Well spacecrafts aren't exactly beautiful and the statement, you have to enjoy this movie as a picture is stupid, because it is a movie after all. Maybe Kubrick chose the wrong medium for his 'art'. Later on even the music itself stops and it gets worse and worse. Some critics said the ships must be slow for being realistic. That is stupid, because in space velocity is relative and it wouldn't be less realistic if the ship was faster or slower. Over all there isn't much of a plot, which doesn't need to be a bad thing if the rest is entertaining. But it isn't entertaining, therefore plot is missing. I have to admit, that the end became interesting again. After a psychedelic sequence, where one doesn't know what it means come a few very good scenes. My friend insisted, that one can't really grasp the whole thing without reading the book along. But that is not the characteristic of a great movie. The psychedelic experience could also have been caused by a lack of oxygen leading to a dream sequence. One couldn't know the difference. I believe, if you'd take only the first ape sequence and the last aging and rebirth sequence you would really get a fascinating movie. What I most hate about the movie are the people watching it and telling me it is one of the best movies of all time. These are the same kind of people that visit an art gallery for the sake of telling other people that they are interested in art. Even my friend, who praised the movie, suddenly admitted that the movie is in fact boring for the most part. Art is not good because it bores you. It is the same mentality as saying, that culture has to be boring and that boring things are culture. And yes, I am not the kind of person who loves action movies. If it would be an intelligent movie, it wouldn't be boring, because really intelligent movies aren't boring. People brag about the philosophical meanings of this movie. What is the meaning of a flying spacecraft? Why has to be a philosophical meaning in a fictional short story containing aliens teaching mankind? There simply isn't one. Most people say that this movie is awesome because their friends do and this makes me angry. To sum it up: Boring as a whole but has some interesting genius scenes. It is not a bad movie, but also definitely not great and it is certainly not mediocre."
"Originally, I was writing a huge analysis of this film to post on IMDb, going through the film, thinking about it in detail and peeling back all the different layers to it. About half way through I realised that it was getting too long, and I should perhaps be more concise with my review. This however, showcases the huge amount of substance and detail to be found in this film. In my opinion, the best films aren't the ones that tell you things. The best films are the ones that ask you questions, so that you can think about it for yourself.The biggest theme in this film, in my opinion, is tools. Near the beginning of the film we are watching two tribes of apes just after the creation of the world. They are rival tribes, but then there is a pivotal moment which changes everything. One tribe discovers tools, in the form of using dead animal bones as weapons, and they are automatically superior. When one apes is playing, smashing a bone against another bone, he throws it up in the air and we witness one of my favourite cuts of all time. Suddenly it cuts to a spaceship with a similar shape, millions of years later, and we come to witness the tools that were discovered by the apes now defining who the humans are. The place they are staying in, a spaceship, is a tool. Breathing, which should be a wholly natural thing, can only be done through a tool. A man's only means of contacting his family is through a tool. For a large part of the film the characters wear spacesuits which, to me, although it is all up to interpretation, is symbolic, as, without their spacesuits (a tool) they would be naked. Later in the film, we spend a long time following an expedition to Jupiter which has on board an artificial intelligence computer, HAL, an astronaut Dave, and about three other Astronauts in hibernation. The thing that is striking about this section of the film is that Dave and the other Astronaut who awakens, both give extremely unrealistic and unemotional performances. That probably sounds like a bad thing to you, but that's exactly what the director wanted to convey. The fascinating thing about it is that in a ship full of a number of humans and a computer, the computer seems to have the most humanity.In this section, the two Astronauts decide HAL the computer, has gone out of control and they must unplug him. HAL finds out, and a fascinating situation arises. HAL feels fear. Here, it is easy to view HAL as a one dimensional villain who just wants to destroy things, but really, I think he fears being unplugged in the same way a person would fear being killed. I also think he reacts in quite a human way, killing the the Astronauts in order to save himself. However, Dave reaches HAL's control room and so begins a scene that I think is more disturbing than most things you find in a 12 (I'm British, but I think that translates to a PG-13 in the USA). In this scene Dave unplugs HAL and the most interesting question in the film arises. Is this murder? Whichever way, this is a very sad scene as HAL shows genuine human sadness and fear. At the end of the film, after an odd sequence consisting of Dave going through a light, colour tunnel and then seeing various landscapes in weird inverted colours, he lands in an eighteenth century room. This is a highly debated scene and is completely open to interpretation, but I will give my views on it:In this scene, I think that Dave, has travelled so far out, that time and space are insignificant. What I mean is that he has travelled to a place where it doesn't matter where, or when you are, time moves randomly. You could be in the eighteenth century, you could be on earth, you could keep getting older or you could keep getting older, (which all happen to him): it doesn't matter. And then what I think is the most ambiguous ending in film history unfolds. A much much older version of him appears dying on a bed, then you see a baby on the bed replacing where he was which grows and in the final shot you see it next to the earth, a similar size. So what does the ending mean? What does the film mean? What is it saying about tools? Was the unplugging of HAL really murder? Is HAL really human? What makes us human? Is it trying to imply we are too reliant on tools? Perhaps it is trying to imply that we ourselves are becoming the tools, as the beings with the least humanity. This brings me to my first point. 2001 never makes any statements it, only asks questions. And the great thing about that is that, they are interesting questions I can think about for as long as I want and never come to a conclusion, as I don't think there ever was one."
"2001 is the perfect movie for a certain group of people. You know who they are. Over the internet, in your college maybe--a student or possibly a philosophy/art/film professor. A person with a passion for avante-garde films with wacky imagery and little else. They're the type of people who find a college thesis' worth of material from the dialogue in the Matrix sequels, they're the ones that boldly declare a film 'art' and anybody else who disagrees with them 'just didn't get it.' 2001 is art alright. The kind of art that I can only liken as being assaulted and nearly beaten to death by an Andy Warhol painting. Yes this movie is art, and you will hate it for that.This is a shame since normally I like Stanley Kubrick movies, but 2001 is an experiment in film-making and nothing more. The plot is incredibly vague, revolving around monkeys battling a black monolith, a mission to space, and a computer program called Hal going insane since that's what most self-conscious computer programs do. The film is then peppered with other psychedelic imagery that are supposed to convey grand ideas. They'll only convey those types of things if you're pretentious and into that kind of thing, otherwise you'll view it as utterly pointless.2001 revolves around these whacked-out, LSD-induced images to string together some kind of story that interests you. It does not. A parade of shots that have little to do with one another and randomly show things happen does not a movie make.There are no doubt going to be people out there who will try to explain 2001's plot and why you should accept it as being a wonderful film. The thing is this: much like if you have to explain a joke then it isn't funny, it's the same thing with movies. If you have to explain to someone the plot and its various interpretations, then it isn't a good movie.Ultimately I can't change the opinion of the viewers and critics that loved 2001, but if 2001 proves anything it's this: keep your art to yourself."
"This is certainly one of the most boring and meaningless films I have ever seen in my life. I love science and science fiction both. They are in fact 2 of my main interests in life. This movie still bored me beyond description! The accolades being heaped upon this hunk of garbage is hilarious. The most amusing tendency among the fans of this movie is ridiculing those who think it is boring and meaningless as stupid, ignorant or both. I am a professional in the computer design and engineering business. I am not stupid. And guess what? This movie is still boring and meaningless. It does have some of the best special effects of its era. In fact, most of the effects in this film would stand next to todays advanced digital special effects without being embarrassed. This is the one and only redeeming quality of this film. It's a collection of very long, very boring scenes that never seem to end. People have mentioned some of the most boring parts. The problem in listing them all is that it would be much easier to list the parts which are NOT boring babble. This movie is a complete waste of.....what seemed like 20 hours of my life. I highly recommend that you never waste time on such trash. For those who will attempt to dismiss my comment along with the other people they have dismissed let me be perfectly clear. I understood everything in the film. It is simply a terrible film. This pseudo-intellectual drivel is a director who thinks he's quite brilliant in his high school level presentation and vision of the journey of man. Of course he is very wrong indeed! If you enjoy this then I suggest you browse youtube for videos made by either inarticulate adults, or videos posted by immature children expressing their simplistic ideas of the world and mankind. The director is incompetent. What takes him 15 minutes of very boring film, a segment he labels ""the dawn of mankind"", near the beginning of the film is a segment that a skilled filmmaker would be able to accomplish in about 2 minutes at most. In fact that sums up what this movie really is. Very simplistic ideas drawn out, and I do mean DRAWN OUT SEEMINGLY FOREVER, in an effort to convince the audience that the filmmakers were very smart people. Hold a copy of the movie in your hand and you will see the condescension dripping from it. It's disjointed. It lacks cohesiveness. It adds elements of science fiction, horror, fantasy, and pre-teen created entertainment. It also fails to deliver in any of these categories. Stop attacking those who do not like this film. They aren't nearly as stupid as is implied here. This movie really does suck this bad. It's almost entirely comprised of shots and contrived scenes which are intended to showcase the effects. Nice effects. Utterly worthless film. Obtain and enjoy some of the many great documentary films about the space program if you want to see great scenery of space. To complete this huge hunk of celluloid garbage, the filmmakers end it with scenes that are not only long but can only be compared to patients in an insane asylum babbling incoherently. No we're not stupid. This movie just sucks. Beauty? Hardly. Deep? If you have a 5th grade education perhaps. Worth watching? Absolutely not! There is nothing brilliant about meaningless film that must be ""interpreted"" by the few viewers who claim they have the answer. Thats just incompetent lazy film making."
"I'm sorry for the lopsided rating but this movie needs to be dropped down a peg from it's absurd status on the IMDb 250. How this ever got lumped in the other great Kubrick movies I will never know. In Dr. Strangelove you had an awesome dialog about war and with A Clockwork you had a look at violence and rehabilitation as well as many other things.In 2001 you have a look at monkeys for 12 or so minutes. Everyone gets it. It's not hard to get, it's pretty, it has some smart writing but the lack of editing is like watching someones life from beginning to end. 2001: An Eternity would be more fitting. I know some people will say you know what it's perfect, every minute had to be there. That's fine I wouldn't want to rob you of your monkey action or your ship docking sequences but I swear you could do this movie in a short and not lose the message.Maybe that was the point, To do a movie with space imagery and a ton of sunrise images that you can play you're enigma CD with the lights dimmed low as you try and woe some woman with your impressive movie watching resume. Whatever the case this movie shouldn't be uttered in the same breath as his other movies, they actually have content.Knowing his work and picking this one over the rest would be like picking Bad Boys 2 over The Third Man, Eye candy over substance."
"This movie is long. Really LONG. And not just because it lasts 2,5h but rather because there not much in it. The few moments where anything happens may in fact be very artistic and full of deep meanings but there are so few of them and they're so far away from one another that it becomes difficult to even remember what they were half through the movie. This could be reduced to 30-40 minutes and would have lost nothing in the logicBut the most irritating thing are the prolonged scenes showing irrelevant thing happening. Like why do I need to watch the entire landing sequence for 5 agonising minutes?? I mean I got it - the ship is landing. No need to try and bore me to death. Then the lunar travel - again - they are travelling over moon. I get it. I got after like 15 seconds. Whot are the other 4 minutes for? Same with the Jupiter travel, same even with the jogging scene - I got, the man was jogging, do I need to watch his full cardio program for 5 minutes?? Jesus..If you are someone who wanted to watch this because it's on the ""All Time Greats"" list and someone told you it's good - don't bother. It's more interesting to watch the grass grow"
"I'm sorry, good music and cool special effects do not make a good movie! What the heck? I mean, I saw this movie when I was a kid, and I didn't like it. Now, I have a growing appreciation for movies, and I wanted to write a comment from a more grown up point of view. I had 2 hours to spare and I watched this movie, I swear I nearly went insane. I normally put on the subtitles, in case I miss something or misunderstand the dialoug, 89% of the movie is silent! Apes?! I could just go to the zoo and say I saw this movie! I could watch ""Star Wars"" and say I saw this movie! It's the same friggin' thing. I'm not trying to be so harsh on this film, but how can anyone find this entertaining?! How?! Unless you are 150 years old, that is the only way I could understand. Geez, people. This movie is so out dated and needs to be thrown away, especially from the top 250! Why are so many bad movies on top 250?! I'm getting sick of these over hyped movies! 1/10"
"If the Earth was about to blow up and I could choose only 1 film to survive us, it would definitely be this. What's funny is ""2001"" isn't even my favourite movie. But I believe it tells the story of humankind better than anything else I've ever seen on the big screen. Essentially it asks the age old question ""what is the meaning of life?"", and for my money, it provides a very satisfying answer.What makes it such a phenomenal work of art is that it is able to address some of the most divisive, incompatible human attitudes (in particular, religion) and present us with a model that we ALL can accept. Judeo-Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Scientologists, Fundamentalists, Existentialists, Atheists and even Satanists can find truth in this film because it applies no labels. Like the mysterious yet commanding ""black box"" that appears in the film, it remains exactly that: a sealed black box which can be anything we choose to see.The black box may represent God. Or it may represent science. Or it may represent history. Or it may represent individuality. Make up your own mind, and you will learn a little something of yourself. Really, this movie is like a puzzle with infinite solutions, designed to teach us about ourselves by what we see in it. It's truly interactive. No other film has ever made me feel this way.The plot is almost irrelevant, so I won't bother summarizing. What you should pay attention to are the themes and questions the movie addresses.1) Are we alone in the universe? 2) Is there a point to life? 3) Are we heading in the right direction?By the time the movie ends, you should have an answer to all three, and yet all our answers will be different.SO WHAT THE HECK IS THE MOVIE ABOUT? OK, since you've read this far, I'll give you an idea. The movie is about evolution. Not just your Darwinian natural selection stuff, but a compelling proposal that evolution was (or continues to be?) guided by some extraordinary force. If you like, this is the marriage of God & science that we've all been waiting for. Or if you like, it's a testament to pure science. Or pure God. Like I said, Kubrick allows for every possibility. And I have to hand it to him for remaining so tight-lipped that nobody ever knew what his personal feelings were on the matter.The film starts in prehistoric times with a tribe of moribund ape-like creatures on the edge of either extinction or excellence. Then we jump ahead a million years or so to find humans in a similar state of stagnation yet on the edge of another fantastic evolutionary step forward. Finally we jump forward to catch a glimpse of what evolution may have in store for us in the not-too-distant future. If it sounds like a documentary, I suppose it almost is, except without Marlon Perkins talking over it. We are expected to fill in the details ourselves, and that is the beauty of what this film does. It takes a purely objective approach and manages to lead us to our own satisfying conclusions.A word of caution. I don't think you're supposed to ""get"" this film on one viewing. I certainly didn't, and I've never met anyone who did. Even Roger Ebert (who ranks this as the greatest film of all time) was initially lukewarm about it when it premiered in '68. So if you feel like you just got cheated, or if you have no idea what everyone's raving about, please be patient and give it some time to sink in. I saw this movie when I was 16 and loved the middle part but hated the ending. Decades later I saw it again and suddenly understood it better. But I confess there's still a lot I haven't realized. I suppose as I get older and hopefully wiser I'll continue to interpret new ideas. And that's why this is the greatest movie of all time. It is about evolution, and moreso it EVOLVES WITH US."
"When I first saw this movie as a teen, I really liked it. When I watched it today, I found it bored me almost to tears. While it initially was a tour de force in movie making and introduced a couple of advanced sci fi concepts of the late 1960's, it doesn't stand up well in today's culture.The plot is extremely thin, and could be told in very few words. The plot moves at a snail's pace. It was impossible for me, as a technically educated adult, to avoid spending the idle time spotting bad physics, improbable technology, and unrealistic events.The cinematography is highly touted, and it undoubtedly represents a significant step in the advancement of film art. Nonetheless, there are aspects of the film that I found woefully unconvincing by today's standards. Scenes that created high drama in 1968 are now sadly obvious fantasy that prevented me from enjoying the film.The ending is so obscure that, if you plan to watch the movie, I'd recommend reading the book first.This movie joins a list of others that I never wish to see again, and in fact, I regret having spent time on it this time around. If you are less technically demanding than I have become, you might like it, but you might still find it slow moving and dull."
"For the first time we see a mysterious monolith still for long before appearance of the first human. Stanley Kubrick in the company of the screenwriter Arthur Clark shows to the viewer of monkeys. These are the beings, rather primitive from the point of view of social lines, who don't have accurate public organization. But here on the horizon the mysterious Black Obelisk appears. Creators only begin to provide the thinnest surgical hints to the viewer as a food for thought. Opinions of most of both film critics, and mere mortals dispersed about it from the moment of the movie premiere.The further travel to Jupiter looks awesome, with fascinating sounds and the color images rushing before the astronaut's eyes. The long episode of an unreal travel sharply breaks with a scene in usual, quite realistic situation in the living room where the traveler endures the accelerated aging and regeneration, having come to be an image of the star child. The star child who comes up from a monolith in space is result of this coition. This creation which received absolute knowledge, having experienced physical death and having revived, smoothly moves towards Earth. There, having found a physical body, the star child will differ from other people as well as modern people from the space station differ from the monkeys.  
The musical motifs (Richard Strauss' Also Sprach Zarathustra, Johann Strauss' Blue Danube Waltz) will forever bring the film to mind, and snippets of its minimalist dialogue (""Open the pod bay doors, Hal"", ""Good morning, Dave"") pop up in homages and cultural references.In the end just wanna tell, that this is one of the best movies ever. With fantastic atmosphere, deep philosophical implication and a nonlinear plot. All of this forces your gray substance moves and to look for a way to a necessary enlightenment. And here, when you would seem it is already close to it, ""the space Odyssey"" quickly slips out your ""hands"", leaving you alone with own thoughts."
"In late 1968, I got my dad to drive me to Hollywood (I was ten) to see ""2001"" during its roadshow engagement. Earlier that year, during a family trip to San Francisco, we had stopped to eat at a Howard Johnson's diner, and with our meal I had received a comic book promoting the film. (If you'll remember, one of Kubrick's less astute predictions was that Howard Johnson's would be the food franchise on the Space Station.) After the mind-blowing revelation of that comic book, I suffered through four or five months waiting for my chance to see it. It took two tries. The first try was the weekend that the Apollo 7 mission became the first to circle the moon. My dad took not only me but also my mom and six-year-old brother. We drove the thirty miles to Hollywood......only to find that ""2001"" was sold out. Quickly we checked the paper for a suitable alternative. There was an ad for another interesting looking sci-fi film playing just a few blocks up Hollywood Boulevard... ""Barbarella."" This was literally just a week or two before the ratings system went into affect, so the only way we had to judge the suitability of the subject matter was by the ad, which was illustrated with goofy, fun-looking cartoons. ""I wanna see Bar-bella!"" my brother cried excitedly. It looked good to me too. So off we went. Try to imagine sitting next to your fairly prudish mother in 1968, watching -- without any warning -- Jane Fonda's zero-gravity striptease. And then every stripe of fetishism and polymorphous perversity, under only the thinnest satirical sci-fi camouflage. I remember afterward, out in the lobby, my dad kneeling by my sniffling brother, gently explaining ""Those dolls couldn't really have been biting her  they COULDN'T really bite her because their teeth were angled in if they were really going to bite her their teeth would have had to angle OUT. So you see"" But I digress. On our second try, dad took just me. This time we got in. The theater was huge, with dark red curtains. The screen was huge, but thankfully not deeply curved like a Cinerama screen. (Over the decades since then, I have seen ""2001"" several times at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood, where the screen IS deeply curved. Every time the spaceship Discovery is shown from the side, it curves up at the ends like a smile. By the nature of its visual geometry ""2001"" was meant to be seen on a FLAT screen.) The overture began  weird otherworldly sounds like I'd never heard before  as the auditorium lights slowly dimmed. And then, that amazing stylized MGM logo, created specifically for ""2001"" and never used at the head of any other film (although MGM did later adopt it for a time as their corporate logo). And then the thrilling swell of ""Also Sprach Zarathustra,"" and that awesome lineup of the moon, the Earth and the Sun! An image like nothing ever seen before on a movie screen. Or in real life either -- ""2001"" was showing us vistas of our solar system that NASA photography had yet to capture even approximately. Half the time I had no idea what was going on. But I didn't care. To me it seemed like a film FROM the year 2001. I was enthralled, and goaded to TRY to understand. More than any other film I can think of, ""2001"" really lived up to that oft-misused cliché phrase: it made me think. Driving home that night, I remember doing the math: in 2001 I'll be forty-three. I'll SEE all that! My dad died in 2001."
When two years ago for first time I saw a space Odyssey I get nothing from it. It seems to me nonsense. But when I saw it again a few days ago I'm completely mesmerized by this piece of art. I'm not going to talk about the beginning of the movie that shows us the process of progress. The cube is the thing that I'm going to talk about. I think it's a symbol of ignorance. It doesn't matter how much we make progress in science because there's always unknowns for human even more than before. How much did monkeys and professors know about the cube? Which group has more questions? For sure it's professors who have more questions and more unknowns. The spaceship's style is like a sperm and we can see it better in the last minutes when the spaceship's body could be seen as a sperm like moving light. I think it means that our space Odyssey is like a sperm's journey to the womb. And our knowledge of the world around is as same as a child's knowledge of surroundings in the womb. That's why we can see the cube in the room at the end of the Odyssey in front of an old sperm and a young and new infant.
"""2001: A Space odyssey"" is one of the great cinematic visual experiences ever put on film. And flying across the United States from coast to coast while staring out the window is also a great visual experience. Yep, you're certainly glad that you weren't asleep the whole trip, but there's no way to stay awake the whole time either. Such is 2001. Looks Fantastic, but at some point you're just staring out that window wondering ""For God's sake! When will we FINALLY touch back down and get on with it? Some fans see Stanley Kubrick as God. I see their point. God created this incredible planet and there's so much surrounding heavenly beauty to behold, just like Kubrick stuffs into 2001. That said, you just reach a breaking point at which you're like ""OK, nice planets! Nice starry heavens!! Nice lens flare!!! Assuming though that I'll live at least one more day, I'll try and see the rest of it tomorrow 'cause I'm like really freaking' bored silly right now! Yep, tomorrow. I'll admire it . . . tomorrow . . . or the day after that, but for now it's just putting me to sleep. And guess what? My own dreams never leave me bored! I just don't commit them to film and then charge admission. THAT would be cruel."
"This move came out in the year when I was born, and I think it is still one of the best SF-movies ever made. The special effects are still outstanding, especially when realizing they were made without any computer, in a time - one year before the first moon landing - in which mankind had not yet seen Earth from space. The imagery is fantastic, and the story is mind-blowing. This is not a standard SF-movie with a predictable speedy storyline and a clear answer in the end; if you expect such a movie then do not watch it. It is a movie that shows space travel how it really is, made in a time when people were still fascinated by it and full of hope, with an intense experience that is truly alien and beyond our imagination. If you watch it for the first time, then watch it on a screen that is as large as possible and open yourself for a great cinematic experience."
A Great Movie With Such A Unique Concept Of Evolution... Just Loved It...
"Kubrick's version of Science Fiction is nothing short of amusing. The effects, lack of music and smart commentary steal the show, making this a greatly made and profound film. Kubrick's depiction of space feels like an endless void of silence, which is the most realistic and scientifically accurate depiction of space. The acting is flawless, the sequence at the end (spoiler) of Dave seeing psychedelic visuals for almost 10 minutes os a great way to show the might of the monolith, and how you shouldn't be searching for answers, as they might be incomprehensible. 2001 a Space Odyssey is definitely the best movie I've ever seen. A definite 11/10."
"When it comes to my experience with Stanly Kubrick's seminal sci-fi game changer, 2001: A Space Odyssey, it's sadly quite limited as I never watched the movie growing up and even if I had, I would have been bored to tears given the movie's glacial pace and it's complex themes about technology so for the longest time, 2001: A Space Odyssey was always a film that passed under my viewing radar until my dad showed it to me and while the visuals impressed me, I was less than impressed by the story. However, late last year, I rewatched it again with my dad and this time, I came to see it for what it is. From its thought-provoking themes and lavish visuals to it's acting and captivating musical score, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a triumph of not only filmmaking but also of visual storytelling. Without it, the world of science-fiction cinema would look very different and we wouldn't have films like Star Wars, Alien, Blade Runner, or Interstellar.The film opens millions of years ago in Africa as a tribe of human-like apes are chased from their water hole by an enemy tribal. They wake up to see a high black monolith has appeared before them. With the item influencing their actions, the group learns how to use bones as weapons and drive the other tribe away. We then cut to millions of years later where a man named Heywood Floyd is flying to a massive space station above Earth on his way to a US outpost on the Moon. While there, he blocks questions from his friends about claims of a strange item found in a nearby crater. Floyd then travels in a Moonbus to the item. From there, the story keeps jumping ahead in time, showing us various sequences of mankind as he becomes more and more dependent on technology.As an unsurpassed milestone in cinematic history with the likes of Citizen Kane and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, 2001: A Space Odyssey has not only broken the genre traditions of many other sci-fi films, but has also given the world of film a whole new meaning by bypassing spoken delaying, but in no way does that mean that the film breaks all interpretation and debate. From its splendid ideas about the future to its aspiring execution, 2001: A Space Odyssey isn't a film that is focused on entertaining us with epic space battles and witty banter like Star Wars but rather to leave the viewer in wonder and to make them think. It's a movie that stays with you long after the end credits finish rolling, unlike some more recent films. What the viewer must grasp while watching 2001: A Space Odyssey is that it's not the kind of film where one understands what's going on nor does the film require flashy visual effects to keep the viewer's attention but as Kubrick put it, the film is supposed to an extremely individualistic viewing experience that reaches out to the viewer and project an inward feeling of awareness. To put that into terms, the film is more about discovering the more logical and precise areas of humankind while also being a game changer on both a visionary and technological level of filmmaking which makes for one hell of an felt, but to also excel in transporting the viewer to another world entirely through the magic of 2001: A Space Odyssey, that is pure artistic genius in its highest form.Then 2001: A Space Odyssey was first released in 1968, it split moviegoers right down the line much in the same way films like Blade Runner and Star Wars: The Last Jedi would later do. People walking out of the film were common as many were simply baffled by the film's ultimate meaning and it's story and while it's completely clear why many at first hated or were left confused by what 2001: A Space Odyssey was presenting to them, Kubrick always did what he did best by establishing a second thought in the viewer's head as many left the theaters feeling baffled and even a bit downbeat, but the film sowed the seeds in people's minds that eventually grew over the years. In the late 60s when space exploration and alien life were the hot topics of the day, moviegoers whet into 2001: A Space Odyssey wanting answers. Will mankind ever reach the Moon? What does the future hold for us as a species? Are we alone in the universe? To their shock, 2001: A Space Odyssey did the exact opposite by leaving the viewer with even more questions to be answered rather than the other way around.One thing that makes 2001: A Space Odyssey stand out from various other science-fiction films is its surprising lack of dialog. Earlier versions of the film included much more but Kubrick cut a lot of it out of the final cut. What's left over is what Stanly intended to use in telling his story. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a film that goes out of the way to show us things happening on-screen in a visual way. The film lets the viewer figure out the message of the film on their own rather than beating the moral into our heads as well as conveying its topical and rational ideas wholly through the filmmaking elements of picture and sound rather than clunky dialog. I only wish this kind of visual storytelling would be applied to movies like Terminator Genisys. When there is spoken dialog in 2001: A Space Odyssey, it's repetitive, uninteresting and all but insignificant to the film's story. During the scene of the shuttle flying to the Clavius base, the dialog is boring small-talk while Heywood Floyd's conversation while flying to the Moon is just as dull and pointless so much so that the musical score completely drowns out the conversation. Without hesitation, the dialog in 2001: A Space Odyssey is the least important thing in the overall story that we are being shown onscreen. This is most clearly seen at the beginning and the end of the film, each of which are spend out over a 20 minute period without any spoken dialog in sight. The movie is flanked by a single-minded disregard for dialog as if Stanly Kubrick is telling us to just watch and not be overloaded with dialog. Both scenes show the most vital story beat in the movie: the strange monolith by some means propels mankind's evolution forward drastically, first from ape to human, then from man to star child. This kind of evolution is visually stripped of spoken words, as Kubrick encourages us in different ways.Unlike some other sci-fi film scores, the music for 2001: A Space Odyssey is all classical, picked especially for the movie and repeated frequently. Kubrick delves into each piece of music to find vivid significance and even learns on these tracks to draw from their cinematic power. The main classical themes for the film are Also Sprach Zarathustra by Richard Strauss, The Blue Danube by Johann Strauss and a few harmonious tracks from Gyorgy Ligeti. The track Also Sprach Zarathustra has become as synonymous with motivational and phenomenal moments as John Williams' music has become with opening film scores. The section of the score used by Kubrick is the beginning fanfare of the score titled Sunrise. Particularly, Strauss's musical piece hints to Fredrick Nietzsche's abstract essay of the same name that deals with ideas such as mankind's rise to something greater than themselves as well as monumental philosophical questions as well. Both questions are right at home in 2001: A Space Odyssey, where both Hal 9000 and the star child can be seen as a superman as well as the theme of the world riddle type question of life's meaning, the leadership of mankind, and the essence of the universe. Kubrick using this piece of music is the perfect way to convey the messages of 2001: A Space Odyssey without the need to explain it to the viewer. Likewise, Stanly also uses The Blue Danube waltz by Johann Strauss to relay a completely unattached idea but it's much more simple as in space, there's nowhere else to go but in circles. Indeed, space is all about rotating around massive celestial bodies, and 2001: A Space Odyssey shows the viewer this continuously throughout the film. The Blue Danube can be heard in its complete form during the course of the film. the first two-thirds play from the entrance of the weapons satellite to Dr. Floyd arriving at the space station and the last third plays as he approaches the Moon. Using such a lofty piece of music to show outer space travel as being stylish, fantastic and like being in a never-ending dance is a brilliant move by Kubrick as it not only shows us how far technology has come in the past 40 years but also how the regulars onboard the space fight view it with a feeling of indifference much like how we view air travel today. Lastly, there are several musical pieces from Gyorgy Ligeti that also help shape the film and its story. All these musical segments share familiar merits, and appear in 2001: A Space Odyssey as a musical topic to guide the Monolith and Stargate sequences. Displaying thick layers of sound qualities rather than using more classic melodies, these musical moments stand up to traditional meaning and show us the mysterious nature of the Monolith, its power, its beginnings, and the beings who created it. Kubrick uses these musical setpieces in the film because each track commutates an unattached look at the film's various themes without the need for dialog. Zarathustra presents the philosophical questions of the film while The Blue Danube transforms space travel into a graceful dance while Ligeti encourages us to find the actuality of a mysterious force without leaving so much as a hint. Kubrick's usage of music in 2001: A Space Odyssey is nothing short of fantastic as it not only helps tell the story but also provided a foundation for film composers like John Williams and Vangelis to build upon in later years. Simply put, without the music of 2001: A Space Odyssey, sci-fi movie scores would look and sound completely different.Another well-defined aspect of 2001: A Space Odyssey lies in the austerity of its soundtrack. Throughout the film, Stanly Kubrick abandons intricate mixes and discord in favor of the most basic of ideas. When the film starts, it's"
"2001: A Space Odyssey is objectively a visual masterpiece; but for those who appreciate a subtler, slower story line, it is a narrative success as well. Does the movie revel in showing off its mind boggling special effects? Does it, at times, seem more like an impressive art gallery than a film? Yes and yes, but even 50 years later, the special effects are amazing enough to warrant the rather pretentious display. It is clear that Kubrick's vision influenced nearly all sci-fi movies set in space up through the 21st century, and the only things that clue into its date of creation are the costumes and lack of outrageous CGI monsters. The calm, long shots of space and the spaceship set to classical music allow the audience to take in every bit of the mystical, beautiful, and slightly intimidating aspects to space and technology that Kubrick wished to convey.
One of the main complaints about 2001: A Space Odyssey is its length and slow plot. There is no denying that the movie moves at a slow pace or that it is long (about two and a half hours), but whether this works in the service of the movie or not is as matter of preference. Admittedly, the style of storytelling is slightly difficult to adjust to when an one is used to the current space movie genre, which often entails exciting action and an ensemble of characters whose personal relationships form a core of the movie. In 2001, the suspense is much quieter, but the drawn out length keeps it simmering constantly under the surface. Instead of an ensemble cast with charismatic characters, the core of the movie contains one human and one supercomputer, HAL. Additionally, the cerebral nature of the third act is radically different from those of Star Wars, Star Trek, and other epic space movies. However, the story line is still thought-provoking, exciting, and fairly simple to follow once its unique form is accepted and celebrated."
"This movie, I have seen it at the theaters when it came out, and many times after. I strongly feel that critics, are falling into a ""The Emporor's New Clothes"" syndrome. Some great critic said it was good, and many others followed. To have the courage to tell the truth, and say it was slow, and boring would make them seem non intellectual. The fact is it is very slow, and boring. The fact that some have called it the BEST movie ever made, is not realistic. Anyone, who has, or can sit through this in it's full length (I have many times) is trying to see what the critics find so wonderful about it. it is not. Criminals should be able to redeem a year of their sentence for each viewing of this film. ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" makes ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"", look like ""Gone With the Wind""."
"This movie is not just good, its amazing. Besides providing us with good performances, original plot, fantastic special effects, thoughtful messages and a lot more, it was an, until then, completely unseen world to the public. This is the first sci-fi movie that takes us out into the unknown space of our galaxy with such splendid effects and mind bursting reality that the audience is left without words. I am only 16 years old, and therefore I was raised into a world of modern effects and 3D animations in the movies. But nonetheless I was really, and I mean completely, blown away by the quality of these effects, even after almost 40 years. The visual effects was just one of the merits of this movie, the camera was in true Kubrick style amazing and enchanting. It feels like you are consumed by the screen and sucked into this surreal world (especially in the round control room or whatever you call it). The effects, the camera and the sheer size of this movie caught me of my guards even though I had seen the rating before I bought it. But this movie has more to it than this. The meaning of this movie can also be interpreted as you wish yourself, even though I think there are some clear points concerning humanity (also true Kubrick style). How humanity on top of its evolution is just maintenance on board, and therefore not needed by the computer, one of humanities tools. How we in space appear like babies, learning to walk once more, losing control of our tools in zero-gravity, breathing through equipment as fish out of water. On the peak of evolution, we set out into the never-ending adventure as simple primates. Many might think that the length and slow pace of this movie is, boring? ridicules? or just a waste of time. But before you can jump to those conclusions, think about why Kubrick spends time with calm music and a spaceship in the middle of space for several minutes. This is to illustrate the beauty of it. Beauty, beauty is in many cases not granted the rightful respect by viewers. Kubrick wants to show us beauty, and if we do not succumb to it and relax, we can not enjoy this film as it was intended. This is not an ordinary movie, we can not just sit and watch as we can with some other movies, this requires time, thoughts and above all commitment and feelings to watch. All of this together, makes this one of the greatest achievements in the world of moving pictures. 10/10 Let me know if you agree with me."
"(r#54)Only Stanley Kubrick could create a film like 2001. It is unlike anything made before or after it and whether you like it or not, it is an unforgettable experience. I urge anyone who disliked this film to give it at least one more chance - I can honestly say that the film was way too far off the wall for me to appreciate it the first time I watched it.2001 is overflowing with iconic images, from the opening scene accompanied by Richard Strauss' ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra"", to the bone being tossed into the air by the ape. It has become such a huge phenomenon that even today TV series, movies, parodies and comics continue to spoof it. It is impossible to hear The Blue Danube without associating it to Kubrick's masterpiece. And that is what it is, in every sense of the word: a masterpiece. Nothing is half-baked or average about 2001 - it is a work of enormous attention to detail and love for the art of movie-making itself. Although Kubrick continued to direct amazing movies like The Shining, A Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket (which were all far more accessible movies) after 2001, he couldn't top this: his crowning achievement.It's easy to see how viewers may be put off by 2001 - it doesn't follow the usual movie formula where the plot comes to a conclusion at the end. In fact, neither before nor after 2001 has a movie been made the same way. Plot line and characters are more or less redundant in this film: It's all in the images and music, and what it all means. I won't go into the point of 2001 since I haven't read the book and I think it is up to each viewer to decide for himself what it all means.The movie jumps from the very dawn of man's use of weapons to a time when space is heavily trafficked, and continues to show us the fate of some unlucky astronauts at the hands of a super-intelligent computer called HAL-9000. I won't spoil what happens in the end but I will say that if you could see it coming, you must be some kind of super genius; as far as I'm concerned it is the single least predictable ending for a movie, ever.Kubrick is the only director that I know of who has portrayed space in the most realistic way possible: vast, endless, dark, empty, and soundless. It's admirable that a director goes out of his way to make sure no sounds are heard in space, but rather than let this make the movie dreary and dull, Kubrick uses this to his advantage: the chilling silence of some scenes actually help build up the atmosphere in a way that no movie has done before. Some scenes are outright scary, working at an almost subconscious level. Kubrick has always been a master of creating moods and emotions with the viewer, and 2001 is the prime example of this: The climactic scene in the bathroom is unbelievably frightening, and Kubrick creates a sense of dread purely without monsters, murderers or loud music. It's amazing.The movie is highly meditative and definitely not the one to watch if you want a loud, action-packed Star Wars-type adventure. The long periods of near-complete silence, the low-key dialogue, HAL's monotonous voice (a stroke of genius) and the scattered pieces of classical music set you in a state of complete relaxation and makes you think. I realize this is highly personal and will not work for all viewers. The special effects are pitch-perfect, still as good today as they were almost 40 years ago. While the digital effects of the Star Wars prequels will be outdated in 10 years, 2001 will continue to stun people with its shockingly realistic and believable effects. Although I would have preferred Kubrick to win the Best Director Oscar for this (as well as many of his other films), the Best Effects award is completely deserved. 2001 still beats many of today's movies in terms of best effects.If you've grown tired of mediocre movies, give 2001 another chance. At first viewing, I thought it was tiresome and drawn out. At second viewing, it was the most perfect movie ever made. If you're open minded, this is for you, if Pirates of the Caribbean is your favourite movie of all time, it's not - and I don't say this to insult fans of Pirates, I'm just saying that this film might not be up your alley.I hope I don't sound too pretentious because I know how horrible many of 2001's rabid fans can be. I know for sure that it is not certain you'll enjoy 2001 - but I urge you to give it a chance. It is the ultimate acquired taste, and in my opinion, a masterpiece of epic proportions."
"Pure and simple, this is one of the greatest films ever made. If one were to ever question the genius of Stanley Kubrick, they only need to indulge in this masterpiece to be persuaded to think otherwise. There are so many positives that can be taken from this picture that it is almost impossible to find a starting point.The film (which was also co-written by Kubrick) begins in ancient times, where we are introduced to the Neanderthals. Primitive and lacking intellect, they encounter a strange monolith buried in the ground. Shortly after this encounter, one of the primitives discovers a weapon that they use to not only hunt and fend for themselves, but also to evolve. As a matter of fact, evolution plays a crucial role in the development of this film, as the movie itself seemingly ""evolves"" from one era to another. Later, we are whisked away into the 21st century, where a group of scientists embark on a mission to study a new monolith that has been discovered in the far reaches of the galaxy. Their ship is controlled by HAL 9000; a computer that is flawlessly flawed as we find out later in the movie.Released way back in 1968, the movie has special effects that are absolutely breathtaking. As a matter of fact, upon viewing this film I had a difficult time believing that it wasn't filmed only a few years ago. The scenes might take a long time to unfold, but that is the beauty of the film. The classical music and the effects are used here to illustrate the glory of mankind's evolution thanks to the monoliths that we have encountered. Music plays a critical role in all of Kubrick's films, but here I feel it has the most impact overall. This film is one that every connoisseur of fine cinema should see at least once. I am giving this a very enthusiastic 10/10."
"I bet that Stanley Kubrick spent the last thirty years of his life laughing his tuckus off that of all of his works, this one most profoundly affected the cultural consciousness which he consistently satirizes.Evidence of this abounds: witness the instantly recognizable creations of the computer HAL, and its synthetic voice; the character ""Dave"" and the line ""What are you doing, Dave?""; and the stylized score based on Strauss' ""Also Sprach Zarathustra.""There is no doubt that this is a beautiful, confounding picture that says something about the dehumanizing effects of technology. What *else* it says is totally unclear - the screenplay is often quite witty, but feels like it was never thought completely through. Of course, works that are incomprehensible are often deemed to be profound, and Kubrick seems to have understood that; in fact, the emergence of drug culture and middle-class spiritual yearnings during the late 60s allowed him to create something really huge and really vague, and pass it off as something really deep.The film opens with ""The Dawn of Man,"" where it is implied that man's evolution was directed by either a) an alien life-force, or b) a God-like creature, represented by a huge black monolith.The former interpretation would be the less mundane, more sci-fi expression, but the relationship between man and alien is never developed. Instead, outer space is a setting - an excuse for an excursion by scientists (who discover a huge monolith on the moon), who end up battling against a computer (HAL - increment the letters by one and you get IBM) that turns on its creators.What the monolith means, or what is is doing in outer space, is bafflingly unclear, and Kubrick never bothers to explain its presence. In spite of this (or maybe because of it), many viewers have hailed the film as a religious experience; many more time their drug hits in order to be stoned during the psychedelic final scenes.2001 does have something going for it - its special effects are masterfully done and may be forever unsurpassed in terms of the visual spectacle they produce. (Kubrick garnered his one and only Oscar for this film, for Best Visual Effects.)Also, this is a lesson in how to tell a story through images and sounds. Though it runs 141 minutes, there are less than 40 minutes of dialogue.But as a commentary on the nature of humankind and the universe in which we live, it leaves a great deal to be desired."
"I wish I could appreciate this movie as much as most film buffs seem to.  I do admire some of its imagery--the cut between the bone and the space vehicle, the star child, etc.  The use of music is very effective.  And I suppose some of the special effects were impressive at the time.  But from the standpoint of storytelling, 2001 really leaves me cold.(1) The pace, at times. . .actually the whole time. . .is excruciatingly slow.  This includes several endless minutes of ugly and gratuitous special effects that start immediately after going into the monolith near Jupiter. When people talk about the the movie's technical superiority, they never seem to mention this part.  I guess I don't mind a movie taking its time to get to a good payoff, but this crawling progression is ridiculous. Additionally, no payoff ever really comes, which leads to my next complaint.. .(2) I don't care for the way the film fails to explain itself.  I truly defy anybody to understand what the monoliths are, or what happens in the end, without having read the novel.  I read the book several years after first seeing the movie, and was filled with much more wonder by it.  If Clarke did not mind revealing what his story meant, why did Kubrick have to be so stubborn in making it all so mysterious?  It's one thing to be ambiguous or suggestive.  It's another to make no sense at all.(3) There are no characters that can be identified with.  While others say this is part of the film's genius, I heartily disagree.  The expressionless humans are actually more creepy than HAL.I met an aspiring director once who told me he thought 2001 was the best movie ever made.  When I asked him to explain why, one thing he mentioned was that it was great to watch in the 70s with a room full of people who were stoned.  Maybe I was born too late."
"I find the divergent comments about this film quite interesting. It's either a masterpiece and suprmely involving or it's a worthless boring fake. I think if you were in a Cinerama theatre and had the experience that Kubrick intended, there would be no doubt that you had just seen one of the great films of all time. The pacing of this film is absolutely dependent upon the overwhelming size of the image and the detail of the soundtrack. There is no way to describe in words the power of the first time I heard the Zarathustra theme in a Cinerama theatre. It went way beyond what you would experience even in a concert hall since the music surrounded you and the volume and fidelity were simply overwhelming. This is a film that had people shaking and giddy following the title card! And so it goes for the rest of the film. What may seem slow and uneventful on a video screen was just what was required for an audience to absorb all the visual and aural information. Those stills for example, at the start of the film were accompanied by desert sounds that were so real you expected a cricket to hop out from under your seat. And the long sequences outside the Jupiter ship involving the AE35 unit are entirely engrossing and set one up for the silent horror that ensues. I just watched the film again for the I don't know how manyth time, and every time I see it I am surprised by threads I never noticed. This time I was amazed that the film is so much about murder. Murder as the basis for evolution, murder of humans by machines, murder of machines by humans. And has there ever been a greater metaphor for our technology dominated society that the sequence of the man jogging in his giant squirrel cage while the saddest music you have ever heard plays on the soundtrack?"
"This is easily one of the most overrated films of all time. Of the 141 minute run-time, maybe 30 minutes of that is story development; the rest is just time fillers such as watching a ship fly through space for ten minutes. I found it necessary to engage in other activities throughout the movie while these time fillers went on. This meant I was doing something else for about 90% of the time the movie was on.The music is loud, irritating, and incongruent with what is occurring. Half of it feels like happy show tunes when the visuals are either somber or nothing (i.e. a space ship flying through space for ten minutes).The ending had the feel that Kubrick was trying to do something artsy and creative...but failed miserably and created only something that was a boring culmination to a boring movie.Avoid this one at all costs...unless you want to take a 2 1/2 hour nap."
"Well, While I'm open to slow pace movies - you know, some of the deep and meaningful European movies for instance - I have to confess I have never seen a more boring movie in my life.This has to win the grand Oscar of the most boring movie ever made. And trust me, I watch a LOT of movies - 4 to 6 per day, as my job requires.As to ""BEAUTY"", as mentioned by another amateur critique here, well, I guess ""beauty"" is in the eyes of the beholder as the proverb goes. Personally, I found it, err... not so much ugly (apart from the growling apes) but ... duh... boring beyond belief.How on earth the current rating of IMDb shows 8.4/10 beats the sh*t out of me.I guess I must have missed something."
"I have seen thousands of films ranging from foolish humor such as harold and kumar to brilliance like Requiem for a Dream. I've been wanting to see this film for years and after building my new home theater I deemed that this would be the film I would use for its opening.Wow.I found myself fast forwarding (Something I've never done in a film) through many of the so called 'visual masterpiece's' If it wasn't for HAL I would have broke this garbage into a thousand pieces. Don't get me wrong I love every other one of Kubrick's films, he just missed on this one..terrible."
"As an influence on cinema and as a film made in the sixties, 2001: A Space Odyssey is indeed great. But evaluated simply as a movie, with no consideration given to its historical context, it is nothing special, and is in fact quite mediocre. Here are three reasons why:(1) The characters are underdeveloped. This happened somewhere in the transition from novel to screenplay; the actors do passably well with the material they're given. Consider the opening scene: a bunch of people in ape suits develop the use of tools. We don't know, while watching the movie, that one of the apes, Moon-Watcher, is already more evolved than the others and is influenced most by the black monolithinstead, we see a group of apes, and a random one picks up a bone and smashes stuff with it. There's no clarity in the development here, and the story is left unfinished when Kubrick cuts thousands of years into the future. The characters here, though more distinguishable, are no more complete: the most developed is HAL 9000, and he's a machine. But even his motives are unclear... that may add to the mystery and suspense, but it's only by reading the novel that we learn he begins malfunctioning as a result of guilt. That's an interesting thematic element that's not explored in the film adaptation.(2) The visual effects are unspectacular. When watching this film, the visual element is only interesting if we constantly remind ourselves that this film was made almost forty years ago; without that knowledge, it seems cheap and amateur. There is one scene in particular where about five minutes are spent showing lights flashing past one of the characters; I almost got up and left to find a book to read until it ended. The technology is outdated, and with it the special effects of this filmif 2001 were made today, nobody would be impressed with these effects. We shouldn't have to consider the era in which it was made to respect a film.(3) There is no coherent story. This is another thing lost between novel and screenplay. The film tells two (or three, depending on how you count them) loosely related stories that center around a black monument that is never explained. The novel, by contrast, describes the course of human evolution, and how that black monument shaped it. The final scene of the movie leaves many viewers perplexedafter soaring through light for seeming ages and winding up in a quaint suite, Dave returns to earth as a fetus in a bubble. In the novel, he finds a giant monolith similar to the ones on earth and the moon and is evolved so much as to no longer require a body. In his new immortal, immaterial state, he returns to earth and detonates a nuclear bomb that had been fired before it can land, saving humanity. The novel is a story. The film is a mess."
"2001: A Space Odyssey, was without a doubt, the lamest, most boring, most unentertaining, poor excuse for a film, waste of time, I've ever seen! Whenever there was any form of live action, there was absolute silence. Whenever there was nothing to see but black, it was accompanied by the most horrible set of minor and dimished chords you could imagine. It was a waste of 2 and a half hours. I constantly kept repeating, ""THE END"" hoping that the film would heed my request. I don't see how it can be called a masterpiece. It was nothing but a series of segways from one scene to the next, with each segway getting longer and each scene getting shorter. The most excruciating scene had to be when the ship was entering Jupiter's orbit. A 15 minute sequence with simple images slowly flashing on the screen after being run through a filter. The music sounded as if a three year old had been sat behind a piano and been allowed to bang on the keys. Coming in at a close second, was the first 20 minutes in which nothing happened except two clans of monkeys fought, after it took one of them 19 minutes to realize that a bone could be used as a beating device. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!THE WORST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Spoilers ahead.2001: a Space Odyssey is without a doubt the most challenging and successful film by the late Stanley Kubrick.  This is not a film that you watch in order to be entertained or amused.  Instead it provides you with a banquet of food for thought, images that linger in the mind's eye long after the movie itself is over.  It is a film that you could meditate on.     The film intentionally offers us more questions then it can answer,  it is made to puzzle and mystify, but leaves the viewer nevertheless with a sense of awe and reverence (that is allowing that he has engaged himself in the process of viewing it, enjoyment of this film requires some effort on the viewers part)  the questions that it does pose are large and ominous, concerning the genesis and destiny of the human race, it's ultimate place in the cosmic design and the existence or lack of some creative intelligence behind the structure of the universe itself.     The first of the films Four Quartets gives us a distinct view of the species past.  We see our distant ancestors, half-ape half human, in a state of near starvation.  The climate has destroyed most of the plant life and the vegetarian beasts are near starvation.  An extra-terestial object, a perfectly smooth and angular black monolith, appears and the animals are simultaneously inspired by it's presence to tool-making and violence.  They are transformed overnight into carnevores, and when two tribes encounter each other near a water source, the tribe that has developed tool making capacity, as well as beligerence, soundly destroys the neighboring tribe. The new chief of the winning tribe, empowered by the first vestiges of technology triumphantly throws the bone that he used as a weapon in the air. We see the bone transformed into a floating satellite, which contains nuclear weapons.  We soon learn that the world is torn apart by nuclear paranoia.  The characteristics inspired by the monument's appearance that once helped us to survive now threaten our very existence.     Once again humanity is in crisis, once again the unearthly presence represented by the black monolith will step in to aid humanity in the next step in it's development.  On an exploration of the Moon a monolith identical to the earlier one we have seen is discovered.  The governments of the world, normally mortal enemies, have come together in secret to discuss the implications.  A mission is arranged. the monument has been engaged in some kind of radio communication with Jupiter.  A few men will travel to the destination of the transmission.  Most of them will, for most of the time, be kept in a state of suspended animation.  The pilot of the spacecraft will be HAL a super computer who has been programmed to imitate all  of the traits of human beings.     The film has many outstanding sequences.  As usual for Kubrick the use of classical music is outstanding.  Most memorable are ""Blue Danube"" and ""Also Spake Zarathustra"" (particularly appropriate given the film's theme of transcending ordinary consciousness.)  The cinematography is particularly excellent as well, after a single viewing the film's final 30 minutes will haunt you for the rest of your life.     The character of HAL is the most important from the view of the film's central thesis.  In imitating all the characteristics of human beings he comes to have their negative traits as well.  The paranoia he develops which almost leads to the mission' s ruin is an exact mirror of the paranoia that has allowed the political situation back on earth to reach a point of desperate crisis.  The film suggests that these are the traits that we must leave behind if we are to proceed to the next phase in our evolution.     The architecture of the film is also meaningful.  The designs of many of the spacecraft are intended to suggest reproductive organs and the process of birth and rebirth, the central motif of the movie.  The ending of 2001 is the most spectacular and triumphant ever filmed.     This movie takes a view of life similar to that presented in the poetry of William Butler Yeats and James Joyce's novel Finnegan's Wake.  It posits a pattern to history and human evolution that is cyclic, yet progressive, repeating the same events at large intervals, yet with the human race as developing according to the will of a being with a larger purpose in mind. Though we never learn what this purpose is, the film assures us that the human race is not meant for failure, it's destiny is grand beyond it's capacity to imagine.  It continues to amaze me that in spite of this film many people continue to regard Kubrick as a misanthrope.     This is a religious film, not in the conventional sense of adhering to any specific creed, but because of it's invocation of wonder at the vast panorama of existence and it's involvement with the deepest and most vital questions of purpose and truth.       In the hands of any other director, this would all be perhaps a little too much.  Hollywood's view of life is too puny, usually to encompass the grandeur and intensity of a vision such as this one.  But Kubrick was a visionary, he directs with utter confidence, not only that he can handle material of this kind, but that he is the only one to do it.  The process of making this film used all of his creative resources.  The writing partnership with Arthur C Clarke is the most fruitful in cinematic history. Kubrick had to invent some of the special effects that were used in the movie's astounding climax.  The resources to bring his vision to life did not exist at the time, so he brought them into existence.
     2001 is a absolutely unique movie experience.  Those who miss out on it do so at the detriment of their own intellectual and imaginative capacities."
"I can't remember when or where I first saw 2001: A Space Odyssey, probably because it is just so stunning. It epitomises grace, both visually and intellectually, and more than any other film it perfectly articulates the true purpose of science fiction.Every film (if not art in general) is ultimately an exploration of the human condition; but whereas so much Sci-Fi is simply a stylistic treatment of another genre (typically the Western) 2001 explores concepts that no other genre could - and that is what Science Fiction is for, stepping beyond what we have in order to better understand it. Exactly what 2001 explores is unclear, as the endless debates and its notorious ending make, well, perfectly clear; but if it is meant to do no more than stimulate thought then it achieves greatly.If Fantasy and Horror represent the imaginative then Science Fiction is the philosophic, but only the greatest examples rise to the challenge and that happens too rarely. Blade Runner (Sci-Noir, but anyway) is one of the few, questioning another facet of human nature, again doing so without resorting to blunt explanation when eloquent ambiguity communicates much more powerfully. So too Metropolis, the Citizen Kane of Sci-Fi; but compare these with The Matrix Trilogy (Kung-Fi), which had the potential to be both accessible and thought provoking but finally delivered only glossy nonsense.As well as breaking technological boundaries in its production, 2001 remains the strongest example of ""hard"" Sci-Fi for its scientific realism and the wholly convincing portrayal of future technology - human level, of course. Not just in the obvious hardware of the space age but also for HAL 9000, undoubtedly the most authentic representation of AI in either film or reality.I love this film. Over the years I read Arthur C. Clarke's Odyssey novels and found them more or less enjoyable, but the original film remains the pinnacle. When much younger I liked 2010 (A Space Idiocy...) which can only be regarded as a children's primer and was out-grown long ago, but there really can be no comparison between them, maybe with any other film at all. Stanley Kubrick was painterly in his style, but I think 2001 more than any other demonstrates the purest work of his imagination. A masterpiece unconstrained by the world that spawned it.As I write these words, 1040 other people have already had their say and I can only assume that no-one else will ever read this. Sadly I'm not patient enough to wait for another 960 to do the same, so the ultimate 2001: A Space Odyssey commentary will have to go to someone else. I hope they like it very much."
"There are spoilers throughout this review.This starts at the ""Dawn of Man"". A bunch of apes find a black monolith and start to evolve slowly. Then it cuts to 2001. A black monolith has been discovered on the moon--buried. When the light hits the monolith it starts to emit a message to the moons of Jupiter. Astronauts David Bowman (Keir Dullea), Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) and some other astronauts (in suspended animation) are sent to Jupiter to investigate. However their computer HAL (with the creepy voice of Douglas Rain) goes crazy and kills everybody except for Dullea. Dullea gets to Jupiter and ""enters"" a black monolith floating in space. He's then in a room being watched over by alien beings. He ages rapidly and dies...but becomes a ""star child"". It seems he has been chosen (for whatever reason) to show the next step in evolution to man. Basically the monolith is a gift from some alien beings who watch over the entire universe. They helped the human race evolve. The monolith on the moon was buried so man would dig it up. When they got to it the signal sent to Jupiter was to alert the aliens that man was ready for his next step.That's MY view of it. Everybody has different interpretations of this movie.I have vague recollections of seeing this back in 1968 at the age of 6 (the film is G rated). I remember the apes at the beginning scaring me...and then falling asleep. Since then I've seen it multiple times at revival theatres and, on one occasion, saw a brand new print with stereo at a play house. Yes--the special effects are impressive. Yes--the music is great. But the movie is long, far too slow and just boring! It moves at such a slow pace that it's sleep-inducing. There's very little dialogue but that's a blessing because what there is is pretty lousy. The human characters have no personality whatsoever and speak in monotones and simple short sentences. Lockwood and Dullea are supposedly buddies but I never got the feeling that they even liked each other! This isn't anything against either actor--these poor guys are given nothing to work with. For instance when HAL kills Lockwood and the other astronauts what's Dullea's reaction? Nothing. He barely raises an eyebrow. I don't blame Dullea--I think he was just playing it like director Stanley Kubrick told him. How can you care about characters who are given no personality or motivations? You know there's a problem when HAL comes across as more real than Poole and Bowman! Also HAL gets paranoid and kills Frank. Could someone please tell me how a COMPUTER gets paranoid???? They give an explanation (sort of) in ""2010"" but it was pretty stupid. There are a few good things about this. Douglas Rains' voice of HAL is suitably creepy. Lockwood strips down to his shorts at one point showing his muscular body. The entrance into the star gate is still impressive (if far too long).People seem to forget that a lot of people hated this movie when it first came out. MGM executives thought they had a disaster on their hands and most people couldn't make heads or tales out of the plot. During a break in a premiere screening for studio executives someone said, ""Something better happen in the second half or we're dead!"" But, inexplicably, audiences seemed to love it and it's now regarded as a masterpiece. Aside from being thoroughly bored by it I find it cold and impersonal too. The message seems to be that man is an insignificant little thing in the universe. It's all in the hands of these gods and you can't do anything to change it. That's a pretty creepy message but the movie drags out everything to a ridiculous degree. Boring, slow and sleep-inducing. The 2 is for the special effects and Dullea and Lockwood (I like both actors despite this movie)."
"I bought this movie because ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", was one of the ""classics"" I had not yet seen. I had a brief prior understanding of the plot (the whole Hal thing), but was fairly in the dark about this movie. I was excited when I sat down to watch it.I can honestly say I gave this movie a shot, but for me, this movie was something akin to watching a plant grow for three hours. I am sure there are some that find this movie to be a masterpiece. But I have to believe for most of the public, this movie was almost intentionally boring.Now intellectuals will claim, ""You just don't understand the brilliance of 2001: A Space Odyssey"". Well I am hear to tell you it it has nothing to do with understanding...rather its about ""wanting to understand"". I have no interest in spending 3+ hours of my life being supremely bored, trying to analyze what Stanley Kubrick was trying to communicate 35+ years ago.The purpose of any movie is to entertain, and if after being entertained you can take away a deeper meaning in a movie, then all the better. But you first must have an entertainment value, which in my opinion this movie was devoid of.When I finally hit the stop button on this movie, I could not describe how let down I was. I am not into space movies all that much. Lasers, phasers and androids are not my thing. But one of my favorite movies was ""Alien"" - A slow paced movie that thrived into a classic because of the incredible suspense associated with it. There was a great payoff after the first hour of waiting.When I was in college, in my Literature class we used to sit around for hours discussing what the author (i.e Twain, Hemmingway, Poe, etc...) ""really meant"" in his book. I always used to suggest he meant what was written in his/her book, hence why he wrote it. I was usually dismissed as ""not getting it"" as others suggested some deeper meaning, something the author did not write, but somehow what he actually meant.OK, whatever. Everyone is different. Some people see 2001: A Space Odyssey as a masterpiece. I see it as an extremely over-hyped movie, the most boring movie I have ever seen and I will never watch again.And in the rare case this movie had some deeper meaning that Stanley Krubrick wanted you to find, I have to ask....Who Cares?"
"If this movie was aired as an episode of The Outer Limits series (without revealing its director's name) the only thing that would make it stand out would be THOSE TENS OF MINUTES OF POINTLESS VOID. As some have said already, even for me this was one of very few movies where I skipped minutes of a movie void.The special effects used to take us into the space were probably stunning back in 1958. Today they are OK. Which is great achievement. But unless visuals are bad to the level that they are disturbing in my opinion they should not have much weight in rating.The primates on the other hand were simply terrible. *ANIMALS SHOULD NOT BE PLAYED BY PEOPLE IN COSTUMES.* I do understand not much could be done in 1968 (even CGI Caesar in Planet of the apes is not 10/10), but I write review for viewers in 2014+.Another issue I have with this movie is the technology predictions Kubric made here. A director should know this stuff never withstands the test of time. A truly great sci-fi focuses on gadgets as little as possible and rather spends the time/effort to tell the story (or build the atmosphere) instead.In ""2001"" Kubrick spent minutes showcasing wannabe-futuristic devices, and the result is that in 2014 they look silly. This rookie mistake alone safely renders all the ""10/10, best SF ever"" reviews ridiculous and out-of-touch.Given what I'm about to say about the message of this movie I can't decide myself whether torturing us for minutes with stuff like the blinking computer interface during the landing sequence was a mistake or a compensation for lack of something...As for the ""deeper meaning""... You know the feeling when you are doubts about whether you are getting what the director was trying to say? Of course you have some ideas, but you keep dismissing them thinking ""nah, that's too banal, there must be more to it""... And then you read what the excited people have to say about it, what people who claim to ""understand the movie"" think. And they happen to repeat what you dismissed earlier as being too banal. There are many reviews calling us (those who don't like this movie) morons. One such review explained ""the morons don't understand the monolith was a teacher, and then a beacon, a tool, a next phase..."". Ummm okay, I say, so it IS actually that banal. Yet it takes 2.5 hours of your life."
"Sure, the special effects of this movie were pretty good, even in the year 1968, but c'mon, what else is there to give it praise for? The movie was overlong, boring and made absolutely no sense. I didn't find myself caring for any of the characters, it was horribly directed by Stanley Kubrik and was a poor execution. Call me contemporary, but I like a film where there is a little dialogue, not a complete hour of total silence. I have lots of patience when it comes to film (I enjoyed Citizen Kane, Casablanca and There Will be Blood) but I found this film to be super overrated and shouldn't even be on IMDb's Top 250 List. The Even if they cut an hour, this movie would've and could've been way better. I also heard that Stanley Kubrik cut about 20-30 minutes to make the pacing faster. What pace? It took 2 and a half hours to tell an hour long story. I would sometimes fast forward and I would find that I missed nothing. You'll notice I didn't mention anything about the acting. That's because there was little acting. The only thing we see is actor's expression and small amount of dialogue. The only reason I gave this movie 3 stars is for the HAL storyline. That is the only interesting part of the film. And if you're going to give this film a 10 simply because it has great special effects, then give a 10 to Avatar and Star Wars (OK Star Wars may deserve it, but you get the idea). This film proves that special effects cannot save a film that has horrible directing and a painfully slow story. If any, this is a film that is only for hard core Sci-Fi buffs. Anyone else will be bored completely out of there heads without a fast forward button handy."
"I had no idea what this would be like the first time I saw it. I thought it would be boring and plotless, but I was completely wrong.2001: A Space Odyssey is the best film I've ever watched, Sci-Fi or not. Almost everything about it is perfect. If it wasn't for 2001, current science fiction would be more ""fun with strings and fishbowls"" nonsense.The special effects and models still look good today. The attention to detail on the spacecraft interiors is near obsessive. One one could sit through a viewing just pointing out tiny details on the monitors. But that's not really the point of this film.In fact, 2001 isn't really a science fiction movie at all. It looks like pure science fiction, but not if you watch closely. There are several plotlines about evolution, the use of weapons, etc.I also seem to like everything that alot of people didn't like. Kubrick made a film that was made for people to THINK about, not a movie for quick thrills. Space is huge and completely silent; Astronauts aren't actors . Why can't people seem to grasp these theories? Critics blasted Kubrick upon release apparently for lack of explosions and no overblown dance numbers. Now no critic dares say a negative comment on 2001 or else ruin their career.The brilliance of 2001 has now deteriorated into the nonsense of ""Independence Day"" and ""Armageddon."" I almost wanted to barf when somebody called THOSE serious think pieces."
2001 Space Odyssey is complete and utter crap. It is the most overstated movie ever made. DO NOT waste your money or your time with this rubbish. Be careful about people who go on about how great this movie is. Most of them are pretentious idiots that simply join in the band wagon for fear of looking stupid.
"I really detest Stanley Kubrick. This so-called ""great"" director made exactly three good movies in his entire career: LOLITA, DR STRANGELOVE, and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. The first one was pretty conventional Hollywood fare, the second a brilliant, jet-black comedy about the Cold War that hit every nail right on the head, and the third a brilliant but extremely unpleasant film adapted, I am told faithfully, from Anthony Burgess's dystopian novel.That's all she wrote, folks. Three good movies and he's a great director.Who decides these things, anyway? He made a mishmash out of Stephen King's brilliant novel THE SHINING in 1980, so obsessed with his own cleverness and ""vision"" that he simply ripped the guts out of King's work and replaced it with basically a lot of stunning visuals signifying nothing.Which brings us to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. I remember reading somewhere that back in its day it was the fashionable thing to watch this movie stoned.I can see why. There's a plot here somewhere, but I can't find it. All I see are a bunch of disjointed scenes, all of which are either beautiful or at least interesting to look at, but which tell you nothing.Keir Dullea, a talented actor who was cruelly misused by Hollywood, appears stoned himself for much of the proceedings (perhaps he was, it WAS 1968 after all). In fact, at the end of the day, the best performance in the entire cast was given by Douglas Rain as the voice of the maniacal HAL9000 computer.And as usual with Kubrick, the thing is interminable; at nearly two and a half hours, it screams for a pair of scissors, or perhaps a machete.Are people so afraid of appearing dumb that if they find a movie incomprehensible they automatically assume it must be a work of genius? I don't know. What I do know is that Stanley Kubrick was a director who spent most of his career creating wonderful visuals. But that is it. Most of his films are all style and no substance. This one is one of the worst.How this film made the AFI's #1 spot as the premiere film in the sci-fi genre is a mystery that I shall never understand. This movie is pure dreck from start to finish."
"Everyone who likes this movie for its plot and philosophical content refuses to explain why. Instead, they dish up constructive comments like ""if you don't get it, then I won't bother explaining it to you"". Sophists used to apply such methods in order to make themselves seem wise. They would walk into a room and utter something completely unintelligible. Those who didn't understand it, believed that it had to be their own fault, as the sophists had already established a reputation for themselves. Also, they didn't want to ADMIT that they didn't understand it, as they believed it would make them look foolish. And so, what was in fact devoid of meaning began to be called ""deep"" and the word ""mysterious"" became positively laden. Well, I claim that 2001: A Space Odyssey is empty and meaningless. People have claimed otherwise, but no one has ever EXPLAINED otherwise. And surely the burden of proof must rest with them. Trying to disprove what has never been proven to begin with is a waste of time. It would be like attempting to disprove the existence of the easter bunny."
"Let's just get one thing straight: The only reason I've given this film 1 star is because the option for none isn't available. This film makes me feel ill. Here's why.You can bandy around all the 'before-its-time' and 'visionary' platitudes you like, but the simple fact is that this film has no plot, its actors are on autopilot, its themes could have been drummed up by a four-year-old, and it's all directed with the kind of pomposity with which Stanley Kubrick was terminally afflicted.""Kubrick? Pompous?"" I hear you cry. ""But what about The Shining? What about A Clockwork Orange? What of Doctor Strangelove?""Well, let's see. The Shining is good, but only for one reason - Jack Nicholson. Without his quiet madness and eventual raving, axe-wielding, snarling, cackling insanity, this film would just be an hour and a half of slow tracks through corridors broken up by scenes of people you couldn't give a damn about.A Clockwork Orange? Boring. The book is superior (as was The Shining, now I think about it). Humourless, dull, meaningless and dangerously close to juvenilia. Fourteen-year-old boys love this because people get hurt with sticks and there are boobs in it.Doctor Strangelove? Ah. Now I come to a problem, because Strangelove is a great film. However, I make no apology for saying that it's a great film DESPITE Kubrick, not BECAUSE of him. Peter Sellers is excellent in all three of his roles, George C. Scott is an acting powerhouse, and Sterling Hayden is a joy. The story is from a novel by Peter George. Kubrick brings nothing to the party.So, I think it's fair to say that Kubrick is a mediocre director with delusions of grandeur who rode to stardom on the back of exceptional performances from actors far better than he deserved. He wasn't a visionary. He was a hack.Now, back to 2001: Overrated Excrement. Sorry, I meant A Space Odyssey. That's another thing: comparing this dross to The Odyssey is like trying to make people believe 'Ernest Saves Christmas' is on a cultural par with Alfred Lord Tennyson.I started out a few paragraphs ago trying to explain why this film is so bad. Let me try again. There are a few themes in this, but they really boil down to these visionary gems: 1. People are bad to each other. 2. Technology is evil. 3. There is more in the universe than we can see.Hmm. Even in 1968 these theories were old hat. So, needless exploration of thoroughly explored themes aside, why else is this film pathetic? Well, the acting is sub-par for one. Keir Dullea's performance as Dave the Astronaut was practically non-existent. The film would have been much the same if he'd been replaced by a houseplant. Possibly better. And he was the protagonist. The film had to hinge on him and a computer, apparently voiced by somebody on massive amounts of lithium. Understated and slowly unnerving or just dull? I know which one I think. I like slow burners. I much prefer the build-up of tension to the shoddy action fluff made famous by the Bruckheimer/Affleck pairing, but this film has no tension. It has no build-up. It has nothing. The oft-heralded special effects are nothing special, even allowing for the thirty-five year time gap. The universally fawned-over shot of the bone turning into the spaceship actually made me embarrassed at its ineffectiveness. It was definitely amateur-hour at Stanley's house when they cobbled that together. The use of classical music is decidedly underwhelming. The 'Ballet In Space' scene with the ships spinning around each other set to Strauss's Blue Danube Waltz looks like an episode of Battlestar Galactica with the wrong soundtrack. Frank Poole floating off into space after being killed By HAL looks like a little plastic action figure being flushed down the toilet. The ape at the beginning who hurls the afore-mentioned bone into the air looks like a hired strippogram. Pathetic. Absolutely pathetic.You know what? I've had enough of reviewing this rubbish. It doesn't deserve a detailed critique. It deserves to be put out of its misery with a hammer to the temple.I can't urge you strongly enough not to waste your precious time on this god-awful film. I hate it with a passion born not of misunderstanding, but adherence to the idea that a film should not, under any circumstances, be a chore to watch through virtue of its extreme tediousness and pomposity. I stuck through this until the end (even past the ludicrous ending that lasted for about four hours) and gave it every chance to redeem itself. At the end, I sat back, disgusted, and felt a deep sense of gratitude that Stanley Kubrick had gone to a better place - a place where he couldn't do this type of damage again.This film is utterly without merit. Kubrick should be ashamed, and so should you for watching it. If you haven't watched it yet (and I sincerely hope you haven't), please, please, please don't do it. I'd rather you watch Affleck than this drivel.Well, perhaps not, but you get the idea."
"Spoilers herein.Since the disaster of `Sparticus.' Kubrick has centered each project on the mysteries of the narrative. Each film explores some theory or notion about the paths of storytelling and the fragility of those paths. Some get very abstract, like `Barry Lyndon,' where identities are adopted and plowed into nature. Some are rather simple, like `Shining' where the building is the author and teller of the story. But this is the most fun and in many ways the most interesting.Here we have three warring gods. Each might be the one who has created this reality or part of it. Each might be the liar who is telling the story. None can be trusted, or can they? The three are the `real' reality in which we live, but that of course may be completely unfettered by any logic. In the sequel, Clarke has this reality subject to jingoistic forces. The new gods in the equation are two:An extraterrestrial force. It may have even made us and how we see. It may have made all the reality we see as well. It is incomprehensible and capable folding time and consciousness. It may have made the story we are seeing.Dueling with it are humans and HAL. HAL is a machine with reasoning skills beyond that of humans. Thrust into this aether of creation, it may have gained extra powers over what is real and what is not. It may be at odds with the humans or the aliens. It may not be, in fact the aliens may be machines and see HAL and siblings as the point of their efforts. HAL sometimes seems human, sometimes reason itself (Dr. Spock is the palest of imitations), sometimes in cahoots with either or both camps.HAL might be telling us the story, a point underscored by his camera eye. We can't trust anything we see. But along the way, we see some pretty impressive things. It it hard to describe today when every third movie has a spaceship. But when this appeared, there was nothing at all like it. We were conveyed to a new and unfamiliar world, one created new for us, by whom and for what purpose we did not know.Ted's Evaluation -- 4 of 4: Every visually literate person should experience this."
"I remember seeing ""2001"" in the early 1980's and honestly, I did not get it. I recently rented it and honestly, I still don't get it. While certainly a cut above other science fiction films of the day from a visual standpoint, the story is drawn out over two-and-a-half interminable hours.I've heard it described as ""intelligent science fiction."" I've also heard ""Star Trek"" described thusly. But somewhere along the line Stanley Kubrick, unlike Gene Roddenberry and the ""Trek"" writers, forgot about the entertainment factor.I gave it a score of three for the stunning graphics. Unfortunately, that's really all ""2001"" has to offer."
"I usually do not comment the movies I come here to vote, but I have to make an exception on this one. The simple fact that this is a Stanley Kubrick film based on a book by Arthur C. Clark does not make it wonderful. I do not get the 8,3 average.Are people simply too afraid to disagree with the majority of people or has boring become exciting and vice versa. I might enjoy this movie if it would be available in an unabridged version which would probably be 10 to 15 minutes long. For the most part of the movie there's nothing going on (and I don't wanna hear any more of that ""it's beautiful and artistic etc."" stuff, 'cause in my humble opinion a movie is supposed to be entertaining.) Boring scenes about nothing after another with some dialog in the middle and absolutely no plot at all sums up the whole movie.Waste of time (and a good two and a half hours of it too). It's not worth the one star, but since i cannot give it a zero..."
"I never saw this movie in the theater because it was made 12 years before I was born. Yet I have seen just about every space movie made in the last 40 years and this one is by far the worst slow paced movie I have ever seen! It starts out, boring. It goes 25 minutes with out one human word spoken. I say human word because I am not sure if the Apes were speaking Aponese or just gibberish. Not that it mattes because I don't speak any Ape language.Then we go to the space scenes. They are VERY slow. Maybe its realistic maybe its not, I don't care that space is a vacuum with no sound either. I want some space sounds to keep me from feeling like I went deaf. Finally, I could not take any more space scenes. After watching the second LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG one with a sphere spaceship taking forever to land on the moon and coming to the realization that ""This is the most boring movie I have ever seen!"" I decided that all space scenes I would simply put on fast forward. Well actually 2X FFWD is WAY TOO SLOW so I actually put it to 4X FFWD and then the space scenes were normal space speed found in other movies like Star Trek or Star Wars or any other spacey show.I get this film and why some, especially at the time thought it was a masterpiece. For its time the Space scenes were amazing! Look at its competition at the time, the Original Star Trek and then look at this film. There is no comparison. However as far as story goes, it was nearly non existence and the movies pace was slower then a earth worm trying to find a hole on the pavement. I've attempted to watch this movie 8 times in my life and only recently I was able to finish this movie and only because I fast-forwarded near 50% of it.This movie is one of those rare ones where people either LOVE it or the HATE it. There is not a lot of people with an opinion about this movie that simply think in between. I hated it. I'm not a action junkie either, I just hated this movie. So Avoid it if you have not watched it, because it is a CAN miss movie, even if you might LOVE it, there still is no reason to watch this old movie."
"I remember well the first (and only) time I saw this film.  I was sitting with my sister, both with our mouths wide open as the film came to a close. We could not believe that we had spent over two hours of our lives watching such a dull and pointless film. To this day I have been unable to find a living person that will admit to liking this film. I like intelligent, serious films, but this must transcend them all, to the point of comedy."
"Mysterious, languorous, meditative and awe-inspiring. 2001 is not a movie with an exciting plot or well fleshed out characters. (The most interesting character is the AI, Hal) It's a meticulously paced, astonishingly beautiful and thematically rich journey through the evolution of man, with all of its accomplishments and missteps. The canvas is large, the themes it's dealing with are thought-provoking and the production is out of this world. As much as I love the film though, I have to point out the fact that this is not a picture that will please everyone. If you have a short attention span and are used to fast moving action, then most likely you will not appreciate the film. With that warning out of the way, let's get back to praising Kubrick's imposing work of art just a little longer. I'm not one to proclaim best ever about most anything. But in this case I will make an exception. As far as Science Fiction is concerned, there has never been a more groundbreaking and influential film. So on that basis, I considered the most important Science Fiction film of all time. It has been over five decades since Kubrick's masterpiece was made and to this day is still has no equal."
"This is the master of all travesties, how this film is so often regarded as the best sci-fi movie ever made is beyond me. It is a living testimony of how overrated Kubrick's work really was.The story is pointless, since it goes nowhere and explains nothing. There is about 30 minutes of dialog or so stretched out over the entire movie (which also indicates how crappy the story must be), and most of the scenes just keep going and going without adding anything except maybe incredible boredom. Even the actors working on the film though it would be terrible, even while they were making it.This movie is terrible, and should never have been made. If this is what science fiction should aspire too, then science fiction is a sad genre indeed."
"Yes, you may want to seriously check in to a mental institution. I just finished the movie (well watched the first 1 hr and 45 minutes and fast forwarded the last 35 minutes, missing absolutely nothing) and can officially say that I have spent the most pointless, wasteful, and idle 2 1/2 hours of my life. I've spent more valuable time taking craps on the toilet seat than watching this movie which could have easily been reduced to 5 minutes. Wow, I think I've lost at least 90% of my sanity and 100% of my attention span after having sat in front of the screen, finishing up my entire box of cookies and reading an entire chapter on the Art of War (again, I missed nothing from the storyline). I think that probably the most exciting part during the movie was when I farted in the middle of one of the 10-minute scenes of a spacecraft slowly floating its way across the screen. Oh, well I do admit that the first sight of the monolith did raise my heart rate just a little bit...or maybe it lowered it. Whoa, I just realized I was that close to falling into cardiac arrest. Damn......Kubrick's theories might've been wrong about the extinction of the human species after all...FYI to the emotionally depressed and suicidal: Watch 2001: A Space Odyssey......"
"I'd heard that 2001 was a good movie, so walking past it at the library one day I figured I'd give it a shot. Having been raised on Star Wars and Trek I figured it was right up my alley... I couldn't have been more wrong.My main beef was the lack of content and the crypticness of it. I mean, who wants to watch a space ship slowly pass in front of the camera for an entire minute? Who wants to watch a bunch of people in monkey suits dance around a singing brick? I didn't even get where this movie was going until I read a summary online.I have to give it to the people of 1968 to pull off a feat such as this, but that's about the only good thing about 2001. What good is special effects if there is no story to tell? Thank heavens people like George Lucas came along!"
"If I hadn't already seen Eyes Wide Shut, I would be calling this the worst movie I've ever seen. Because I have seen EWS though, the best I can do is say that this is nearly as bad. The acting is fine and the score is excellent, but the story is underwhelming and the movie as a whole is excruciatingly slow.Even the score, which, on it's own, is impressive and iconic, seems forced and dragged out when put up against many scenes.Great for an insomnia patient though, I'm sure, and if you were high, you'd probably enjoy the last 20 minutes, but I nearly quit before the space scenes even started. In hindsight, I wish I had.I will never watch another Kubrick film again."
"What can this film tell us in 2004? Almost nothing. First of all is slow, much too slow. Second it wants to be a beautiful film, but it is not a beautiful FILM, it is a collage of impressionistic pictures, which are unfolding in a slow manner. If I want to see some beautiful pictures I go to a photograph exhibition. A film is dynamic, it moves. Beauty in a film is created in other ways. A film is not a power point slide show. Third is pretentious since it wants to say something 'very' profound and uses all the tools to signal that. You can say something deep in a relax mode, without all that symbols which connote with high culture and vanguard art. So it is an highly overrated film."
"2001 is about some astronauts up in space on mission, along with a robot named ""HAL 3000"" though the movie HAL goes psyco and kills all but on member of the crew! this movie was The worst movie I have ever seen, from the beginning when i saw the evolution involving actors in ape costumes dancing like year olds to the end where The world starts all over again! the more I think about this movie the more I realize, that it could of been a good movie if it would of had 3 things different, a half sain producer (Stanly Kubrick) and a bigger budget, and some decent music! I would never recommend this movie because i almost went insane watching it in class (MY teacher made me watch it) and trust me it will make u go insane! the production is bad, and i would rate this movie worst movie of the century! I hope you take my review seriously and consider staying away from this torturous film!"
"(Yes there are spoilers... a bit)I'm sure I saw this film as a child, but couldn't remember much of it aside from the images of people walking around the circumference of the space ship, and HAL's 'eye'.I have just finished watching it again and have to say that I was really bored out of my mind.Obviously there is something special about this film for some people, as the comments here and the overall rating of it are testament to... but I don't see it at all.I see: *Some quite impressive images of space flight for a film from 1968 *Some VERY long sequences where VERY LITTLE occurs *Some character setup which went absolutely no-where... (what was the point of showing us so much of the doctor who was on his way to the moon to then have him completely disappear after the visit to the monolith? I'm sure it's just another way of us being dispassionate towards the human characters or something but I just found it annoying to learn about a character and then have him disappear...) *Some extremely irritating jumps with no explanation to seemingly un-connected scenes... *And that damn final journey sequence... what's so amazing about a bunch of solarized images of the grand canyon and water? It really quite under whelmed me.I was extremely bored by the whole experience, but I am NOT going to fall into the wonderful trap that I've read a few others here have, which is to insult anyone that has a different view to themselves. Especially to the person who stated that if you didn't like the film you weren't alive... that's a beautiful way to view the world. ""If you disagree with my viewpoint then you're a soulless being"" Brilliant.All I'm saying is that I have no idea why this film is hailed as a classic, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be... I just don't see it myself."
"I will never get back the three hours of life this film has stolen from me.The film is basically a psychedelic drug trip disguised as an important creative process. I'd love to know what they were on when this film was being made.Its also the most historically-inaccurate film in existence; 2001 has come and gone without any of the events or predictions taking place.Characters are unlikeable, design is simplistic and everything just rambles on without any sense or logic to it.And the ending is probably the worst of it: its supposed to be thought-provoking but the only thought that entered my mind is ""What the F$*K is going on?!"" I'd say for anyone looking for serious entertainment purposes, AVOID this film at all cost and choose a sci-fi movie that ISN'T stuck up its own @$$."
"This movie is TERRIBLE. It is the most bloated, self-indulgent piece of drug-induced trash in cinematic history. There is no point to this film. Hal, who is considered one of the best villains in film, is hardly in the movie. And his demise is one of the most anti-climactic moments ever. It would be one thing if the movie had no point but to take such a long time to say nothing is painful at best. The whole end scene with the guy seeing himself, and then becoming himself is just plain stupid. In regards to quality, it is a drawn-out student film. I wish I had those two-and-half hours back that I wasted watching it. As a writer I am offended at this movie's high regard in film circles."
