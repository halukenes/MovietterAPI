"I heard a lot about this film regarding its scientific validity as a piece of fiction. Perhaps as a result of this I assumed that the film would be a dry affair – an impression sort of confirmed by the longer than normal running time. As it happens, this is not the case at all because The Martian has much more in common with the entertaining blockbuster that the starry cast list and presentation suggest it will be. The story wears its science very much on its sleeve, but yet makes it accessible and fun – with the slick presentation making it so. As a result everything seems to be explained with everyday objects, and even the most complex principles are presented in simple terms (references to Iron Man for instance). As a result the film gets to have its cake and eat it – although the film is helped by the knowledge of a lot of this being possible (eg hitting a point near Pluto recently with very tight tolerances on a journey of years).The film itself doesn't really play up the drama in a heavy way, but rather does enough to invest the viewer in it without making it too much of a downer or serious. The soundtrack is hugely upbeat, the content is mostly light in tone, and the science is delivered in a very user-friendly fashion – essentially in the service of the tone and the entertainment value, nothing more than this. The starry cast add to this feeling, and use their screen presence well. Damon is consistently likable, which is just as well since he is alone in the vast majority of his scenes. The ensemble cast has a lot of depth to it, all of which are solidly watchable – Chastain, Wiig, Daniels, Eiofor, Peña, Bean, and so on. The Chinese aspects of the plot serves as another reminder that this film is a blockbuster out to make money, but it doesn't seem too out of place. Technically it looks great and it impressive how convincing the surface of Mars looks.In the end we get to the fist-pumping mission control scenes that we all knew were coming, but along the way the film is slickly packaged and entertaining as a result; even if the oft-mentioned scientific validity of it all is not something it ever seems concerned with itself."
"The film is the finest examples of science fiction and science fiction embodies everything required. Matt Damon has given the right role until the end of the case. Besides the fact that one does not really need. All movies have moved on their own. We have seen examples of this, such as the Buried and 127 Hours of very good quality movies. The master Ridley Scott's science fiction after a long separation has made a great comeback with this film case. After this film, Ridley Scott disappointing those who say the sound was cut. Thank you for this wonderful film Ridley masters. Maybe the best in 2015, as I mentioned in the title."
"The crew of an American base on Mars are forced to make an emergency departure leaving one crew-member behind presumed dead. But he is alive! Can the stranded astronaut find a way of communicating his plight to those on Earth and survive while he awaits rescue? A fairly standard 'castaway' plot but one which offers many dramatic possibilities. Unfortunately few of these are realised in this pedestrian movie which fails to generate any significant dramatic tension. This is partly because the characterisation is thin but also because the challenges the stranded astronaut faces seem to be so easily overcome. Starvation? Grow potatoes. Punctured space-helmet? Sticky tape. Mars rover vehicle lacking power? Wire up a few solar cells. Communications equipment destroyed? Motor over to a handy Mars lander. We never sense that the 'Martian' (Matt Damon) is in a desperate, mind- and body-sapping struggle against the odds (conveniently he is a botanist).Damon effectively portrays the 'Martian' as a likable guy but the problem is how to fill the two hours of the movie that remain after he is stranded? When a character is alone and unable to communicate it needs something exceptional to keep us glued to the screen. Maybe what's going on back home will do it. Not really because the cast of characters there are verging on cardboard cut-outs. The returning crew? Likewise. And the script is written on the assumption that the audience is a little dumb, e.g. A: It will be 500 Sols (Martian days) before we can rescue him. B: But his food will run out in 300 sols. C: So he'll die before we get there. Indeed! And so may we. The movie has some good FX and the Martian landscape looks convincing. But there's nothing exceptional here to compensate for the lack of an effectively told story.In essence this is an American feel-good fantasy film, celebrating ideals of technical omnipotence, racial harmony, gender equality and international collaboration (with those cool Chinese guys and gals). If only it were so. No wonder the credits rolled to the tune of The O' Jays singing 'Love Train'. School-kids will probably join in! But, to quote Sam Goldwyn, 'Include me out!'(Viewed at the Odeon, Warrington, 06 October 2015)"
"Seeing that the movie was over 2 hrs long, and knowing that the person was going to be stuck on the planet by their self for the majority, I didn't have high hopes for it. Usually these types of movies are boring. Not a lot of writers can pull this off. This movie was really good tho. A group of us watched it and really enjoyed. There were some things they failed to explain, that we collectively came up with our own answer for. Other than that, it was great. I never felt bored or left waiting for more. Overall, I feel it was very well written, produced and acted. Well worth the watching. Some people on here have griped that it was 'predictable', but then, most movies are. Who ever watched Star Wars with the thought that Vader would ultimately win??? Who ever watched Star Trek thinking that Kirk wouldn't find a way to save the day? And frankly, who grew up watching Scooby Doo thinking that someone would actually kill Scooby, Shaggy, Fred, Daphne or Velma???"
"I am a bit of nerd of this kind of realistic science fiction movies and therefore I had high expectations of this movie. I regret to say I was disappointed.The movie tells the story of how the main character struggles to survive on Mars and how the space agencies work to get them back. But I was missing the emotions, the human touch. The main character never displays any signs of loneliness, despair or fear. He is more like ""oh, looks like I'm stuck on Mars, let's grow potatoes"". He makes a one- off reference to his parents in an electronic communication, but nowhere in the movie is it made clear what his main drive is to want to return to Earth. It appears as nothing ties him there. Maybe the directors wanted to avoid the cliché of the eight months pregnant and terminally ill wife eagerly awaiting her husband's return from a dangerous mission, but even a cliché had been better than nothing. His character is also too flat. The only character trait that is highlighted slightly in the movie is that he may be a bit too smug about himself. Nothing else to make me identify or sympathize with him. To be honest, I couldn't have cared less if he had not survived.The Mars landscape is beautifully rendered en very credible with dust clouds and all. This is the main attraction of the movie.The main problem that there is nothing novel about this movie. There have been better movies for every aspect of the film:Human aspect/psychology of being marooned in a strange place: Cast Away did it so much better; set in space: Matt Damon's role in Interstellar was more credible than his performance here. Space action scenes: Gravity had me on the edge of my seat Ground control scenes: Apollo 13 already set the standardIn summary, the movie is a beautiful, but hollow shell."
"Having read the book, and being very impressed, I was looking forward to the movie interpretation. I was not the least bit disappointed. I was hoping this movie would not be an overacted, overproduced and sappy version of the original, and I was pleasantly surprised that the story played out without the overblown extraneous embellishment that Hollywood seems to depend on so often.It was great to see how the screenplay added extra material that was not in the book, and it enhanced the story to make it even better. The characters were interpreted with full respect to the intention of the author, Andy Weir, and nothing was overdone. The pacing and editing of this movie was some of the best I've seen, in fact, some of the one-liners from the book are done so quickly it pushed the story forward relentlessly. One thing that struck me is that everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves, and I think that could be a testament to the originality and uniqueness of the book. I believe anyone who reads the book is captivated and involved with the story from beginning to end, and it's possible this comes across in all phases of the production; the acting, the sets, sound, everything. They all knew they had some great material to work with and ran with it."
"I am genuinely amazed at the number of bad reviews there are on here for The Martian. Now I never read the book, but I absolutely LOVED the film. So much so, I watched it twice within a week. It has been such a long time since I have been left with that wonderful sense of satisfaction after investing two hours in a really good movie, and this did it 100%I am usually left highly disappointed after watching this genre of film, so I wasn't expecting much. Something like Gravity I thought, great special affects, dramatic scenes, and an average storyline, but The Martian was a whole different calibre of film and was perfectly constructed from start to finish. I was instantly thrown in to a scene where astronaut Mark Watney and his crew are setting about their mission on Mars. But the sh*t hits the fan about ten minutes in where a storm causes Watney to be thrown from the crew and left for dead. There was no long lingering introduction to the film and its characters, just instant drama and character development. This forcibly got me caring for the entire crew, and got me emotionally invested until the end.Matt Damon has always been good at what he does, but I felt he hadn't really shown off his true raw talent since Good Will Hunting back in 1997. Well he did in this. He was captivating in every single scene, and managed to do what Tom Hanks achieved in Cast Away and single handedly gripped the viewers' attention completely (with the help of a beautifully crafted script). Another reviewer got it bang on when they described it as Apollo 13 meets Castaway. The exact comparison I too had made and a combination, which works superbly. The makers of this film put so much effort in to making it scientifically accurate which made it all the more pleasurable to watch. There was nothing far-fetched or stupid like in a lot of films of the same genre, and the combination of this, with a solid plot made for a truly interesting, exciting and enjoyable film.There was drama, great effects, humour, heartwarming moments, a great soundtrack and a flawless screenplay. If you only see one movie this year, make it this one. An absolute must see."
"I can't really believe that I just finished watching a Ridley Scott science fiction movie and feeling this low, this one never felt like anywhere close to any of his classics. This is just nothing but a typical Hollywood s***. Matt did a poor performance as a character who is caught in a life and death situation. He is not scared or emotional but instead he keeps throwing Hollywood typical punch dialogues on your face like an Avenger hero when you are expecting Science. A make-up artist or a sound engineer from the set of ""Big bang theory"" would have written better science script and dialogues. For me there are plenty of ""WTF"" or ""Seriously?"" moments in this movie and I wonder what happened to one of the favorite directors of all time. Also repetitive high five/triumph scenes where we don't feel anything. To brief: Drag, bad drama, insensitive emotional scenes, poor acting, very less science, predictable and not at all funny punch dialogues! Just YIFY it, don't buy!"
"I read some of the reviews and decided to review this title myself. That's because I'd like you not to miss this lovely movie.It got some very bad criticism (Reviews&Ratings first page hosts at least 4 reviewers rating this title '1', lowest possible value on IMDb), most of which deals with Physics laws bended to screenwriter's desire. Well I just want to reassure you that even though I am among the nerdiest guys on the Internet, I didn't get annoyed from what I saw. Not once. And if you weren't annoyed by Tom Hanks and his boys killing almost an entire German Division before giving up in 'Save Private Ryan' you won't be annoyed too.It's a movie, not a documentary. And it's a great movie, a classic by all means."
"I wish I liked this movie more like a lot of moviegoers who are giving it good to even great reviews, but I left the theater with a bitter taste in my mouth I had to write this review to reconcile my feelings.Imagine a movie that takes from the glory of Gravity, Cast Away and Apollo 13 which also tries to be as hilarious and groovy as Guardians of The Galaxy at times but fails? You've got The Martian. The first 1/3 of the movie was quite engaging: An astronaut on Mars expedition team gets left behind after a huge storm because he was assumed dead. But he was alive and we watch him try and utilize every cell of his brains and science savvy to survive until help comes. But once he gets out of initial danger things get all too predictable and over-wrought. Couple of annoyances: 141 mins. About 30 mins too long for the storyline. There were too many mentions of Disco music the commander of the mission left behind to ill effect, unconvincing supporting characters on the Earth who seem to be just reciting a script, and some characters the movie shouldn't have had whatsoever (such as Kristen Wiig). Did Matt Damon do a good job ? I thought so until they showed a body double that didn't even resemble him and from there nothing he did was believable unfortunately. Had Damon actually lost weight without using a body double, I might have gotten more into the movie. But then again, he is no Christian Bale. So I wasn't expecting it but a little weight loss would have made him more convincing. A few good acting jobs came from Michael Pena and Benedict Wong whose characters added to the storytelling instead of subtracting it in the midst of too many unnecessary characters reciting an already weak script."
"The Martian is a science fiction film starring Matt Damon and directed by Ridley Scott. I'm a big fan of Ridley Scott's work as a director, but I feel that most of his recent films have been very hit and miss. However, The Martian serves as a firm reminder as to why I am a fan of him in the first place. Not since Interstellar have I seen a sci-fi movie this thought-provoking or cleverly written.After an intense sandstorm devastates a manned mission to Mars, the crew are forced to abandon the desolate planet and astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is presumed dead and left stranded. Unbeknownst to the crew, Watney survived, albeit injured from the storm, and tries to find ways to survive the inhospitable climate of the red planet. Being a botanist, Watney figures out how to grow food for himself out of the crew's leftover vegetable supplies and uses his scientific knowledge to create water using hydrogen crystals and oxygen from the crew's base camp. However, these supplies can only sustain him for a matter of months as a rescue mission from Earth will take 4 years to reach him. Watney must find a way to signal back to Earth that he is alive and is in urgent need of rescuing before he runs out of food and water.Despite its somewhat bleak tone of survival in a hostile terrain, the film still manages to have its fair share of funny and heartwarming moments, which are seamlessly intertwined into the film's more dramatic scenes. Matt Damon is perfectly cast as the wisecracking, yet intelligent astronaut Mark Watney and his positive attitude toward his survival is what keeps us invested in the story. The rest of the cast are great too, which includes Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Kate Mara, Jessica Chastain, and even Donald Glover from Community. I was also particularly pleased with the film's pacing, there was never a moment that felt rushed or slow and boring. This is a welcome return to form for the legendary director Ridley Scott.I rate it a solid 9/10."
"In an era where science-fiction survival tales are becoming a popular occurrence - with 'Interstellar' last year, and 'Gravity' the year before - writer Andy Weir and sci-fi connoisseur Ridley Scott team up to craft a complex tale that is carried by a single character, that character being Mark Watney, played fantastically by Matt Damon (Hollywood's biggest calamity, who requires being rescued... again).As the film tees off, we are instantly given a first-person view of the dangers of Mars and the fight for survival each astronaut is living out each day on the planet's surface, that is until their emergency evacuation - but nope, even Damon couldn't do that right. Abandoned upon the desolate surface of Mars after being presumed dead by his crew, Damon must do all he can to endure the martian environment. One huge thing I admire about this film's plot, is that it doesn't care about the intellectual level of its audience, as the quote above states so well: it'll science the s**t out of them. It's such a complex and well-executed premise that on paper seems nothing more than a impossible feat to pull off.Technically this film is stunning, the cinematography, the CGI, the production design, all utterly gorgeous, and according to the Golden Globes, it's one of the best comedies of recent years too... yeah, sure. Admittedly the tongue-in-cheek humour does add a more fresh appeal to the film, making it a little more unique than previous sci-fi adventures, it piles on layers of thrills, emotional value and complex character development to create one of the finest science fiction films of recent years."
"It's so frustrating when so many people like and praise a movie that really doesn't deserve it. The Martian is such a movie. I had such high hopes for it after all the hype, and after reading reviews by smart critics I usually agree with, but it was such a disappointment. Here's why: Plausibility. Just like Gravity, there are so many non-sensical depictions of the physics of space travel, it makes my head hurt, and I'm not even a physicist. The characters and their actions are pretty implausible too, starting with Damon's chipper attitude about being left alone on a planet 100 million miles from Earth, but certainly not ending there. After realizing he is alone and will be for so long that he will run out of food, he gets the brilliant idea to try to grow his own, which we are supposed to take as a mark of his plucky brilliance. But he's a botanist! What would a botanist be doing on a space mission *except* studying how things grow? And then when an accident causes all his potato plants to die, the brains at NASA (who can't believe he figured a way to grow potatoes in the first place) instantly conclude (and tell us) that since the accident froze all the bacteria in the soil, he won't be able to grow any more. Why not? He still has potatoes to eat, and he still, presumably, shits occasionally, so he has all the ingredients he used the first time. Ugh! My brain hurts! Writing. The script seems written more by market researchers than a screenwriter. Corny little one-liners (""My balls are frozen!"") appeal to the lowest common denominator in the audience, and the relentlessly happy tone makes being stranded on Mars seem like a big party, complete with disco music (literally). And the dialog!! There's a moment when Jeff Daniels, the head of NASA (whom it is hard to imagine has ever ever taken a science class or piloted anything) talks to the heads of the Chinese Space agency who offer (presumedly--we only hear his end of the conversation) to lend one of their ships to the rescue effort. He says, ""Mmm Hmm. Okay. I see. Thank you."" (That's what a discussion about loaning spacecraft between two space agencies sounds like.) Then he hangs up the phone, clenches his fists, and says, ""Yes!"" It's like Homer Simpson finding out there is still one donut left. That someone wrote that line is astounding. That the director and actor saw fit to actually shoot it is bewildering. That it survived the editing process and made it into the final cut--well, there should be an investigation. Pacing. It's a movie about being stranded on Mars for months and months. Why does it feel like a comedy by Woody Allen or Edgar Wright? There is never a pause, never a prolonged quiet moment that might begin to capture something of the unbelievable space and loneliness this movie is supposed to be about. Instead, it is a constant rapid fire of dialog and action. Even the scenes where he is communicating with Earth via text happens faster than I usually get with my iPhone and 4G. (NASA technicians mention, at one point, that there is a 25 minute delay between all communications, but the filmmakers hope we forget this two minutes later when all the subsequent conversations happen instantly). Then there is the rest of the crew and their additional unplanned two years of extra time stuck in the spaceship, going all the way BACK to Mars to pick up what they left there. If I have to run back home to get something I forgot, the trip always seems infuriatingly long. But not these cheery space travelers! Another two years in space! No problem! And it takes only two minutes of screen time. Piece of cake! AGH! What a frustrating experience. If you want a sugar-coated popcorn movie that will make you think that if being on stranded on Mars isn't really so bad, why complain about our petty little problems here on Earth? then this movie might be for you. It does for being stranded in space what The Shawshank Redemption does for being in prison. It tries to tell us that it's really not THAT bad after all. It's such a lie, and such a disappointment, all the more so because there are so many serious issues and exciting psychological and scientific aspects about space that could have been explored here."
"I don't usually like to give movie reviews - but it was a hot weekend and I figured maybe I'd venture out and see what the culture had to offer. So just how bad was ""The Martian?"" So bad that after an hour I realized I would rather be back in the sweltering 97 degree heat than sitting in an air conditioned theater listening to anymore inane dialog (lines like ""F**k you Mars!"" and ""I'm going to science the S**T out of it!"") In fact it would appear that a prerequisite for going into the space program is at least six months of doing stand up. (BAD stand up.) Why does everyone (and I mean EVERYONE) in the movie sound like one of those guys on ""The Big Bang Theory?"" Snarky and idiotic and always cracking wise. Also: Why did every character, while typing, READ what he's typing out loud? Has anyone ever done this EVER? And what was with all the expository dialog, (the whole script was expository as far as I'm concerned) Throughout the movie Matt Damon talks into a video camera, making a diary and yet he only says things that everyone who would potentially WATCH the video would of course already know, things like: ""Oh yeah, did I tell you? I'm a botanist."" It's clear he was attempting to speak directly to the viewer and NOT the imaginary audience in the movie itself. This is the laziest kind of writing there is. They don't know how to deliver plot anymore except to dump bowling balls of ham fisted information in your lap; telling you things you've already figured out in the most obvious way possible. That meant that there was absolutely ZERO tension. It was like reading an instruction manual for a microwave oven. ""How do I grow potatoes? Oh look there's some poo."" (cue the laugh track) And Ridley Scott's direction was as slack as an industrial film. False stakes, false resolutions, false falseness. Now,I know I only managed to make it through the first hour or so; maybe it got really good after that, but I was starting to feel my brain cells beginning to atrophy so it was from a sense of self- preservation that I skedaddled out of there when I did. (And don't get me started on the disco songs and requisite jokes about 'bad musical taste.' It was just more target-market reconstituted nostalgia-bait.) If there is a more unoriginal, un-involving, unbelievable waste of time out there, I haven't seen it. So of course: Line up the Oscars!"
"The Martian is a new Ridley Scott classic, featuring his best work in years, the best performance I've ever seen from Matt Damon, an outstanding supporting cast, a surprisingly funny screenplay from Daredevil creator Drew Goddard, and a great narrative that ties the film together beautifully. As expected with Ridley Scott films, the film itself is visually stunning. The landscape of Mars looks absolutely breathtaking, and the scenes aboard the Hermes and back on Earth are just as sharp in detail and scope. The way he chose to make this film made it almost seem like an exceptionally made biopic. Many times during this film, I legitimately believed that Mark Watney was a real, living person that was actually stranded on Mars for many months alone. It's Cast Away meets Apollo 13, and this marriage is crafted beautifully. Matt Damon is absolutely brilliant in this film. He plays Watney with so much optimism that it actually makes the depressing aspect of the film not as depressing for me. However, when he has to put on his dramatic chops in certain scenes, he truly commits to the drama of the situation, and that right there is true Ridley Scott suspense for you. The supporting cast, everyone involved, all do great work as well. Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain, particularly Chiwetel Ejiofor. He is one of the best actors working today, and this movie and 12 Years a Slave shows how far he's come. The most surprisingly element about this movie though was the screenplay. The film is hilarious in some parts, in fact I'd argue that it's funnier than most comedies that have come out this year. What makes to movie unique to me was Watney's optimistic point of view. He believes that he isn't going to die on Mars, and this transforms this rather depressing situation into something comical instead. But when you really think about it, this is a very personal film about some people coming together to save somebody. That's it. And in today's world, it's nice to hear an story about people coming together to save one of their own. I have nothing bad to say about The Martian. It's the best film I've seen all year."
"Exceptional sci-fi drama from Ridley Scott about an astronaut (Matt Damon) stranded on Mars and the efforts made to rescue him. As others have pointed out, there's more than a little bit here that reminds you of movies like Apollo 13 and Cast Away (particularly the former). I fail to see how that's a knock on it but it's being presented as such by some. We all come to movies with our own expectations and baggage. I'm not a Scott fanboy expecting him to wow me (his last two films were not great). I just wanted to be entertained and this did the trick. It's a movie aimed at the masses that is smarter than your average movie aimed at the masses. Maybe it's not for all nerds (a quick glance at some of the reviews shows a lot of inane nit-picking from people who seem to have no concept of dramatic license), but I didn't find the movie dumbed-down at all. I also want to say how much I appreciated that this managed to stay remarkably light and positive while still maintaining the tension, proving once again that you don't have to be depressing to be good drama. If you haven't seen The Martian yet, you should. It's a great film with a first-rate cast, good direction, and stellar effects. If you're just looking for a quality movie to entertain you for a while, this should be something you'll enjoy."
"If you've ever wondered if Tom Hanks went even further adrift in Castaway then this could be the answer you're looking for.An Earth team are on Mars carrying out tests on the surface of The Red Planet, a message comes through from Earth warning of a huge and fast approaching storm. The team quickly assemble and flee, unfortunately Mark Watney is caught in the storm, loses his communication device and presumed dead. Watney has survived and has a harsh realism that he's abandoned on Mars with precious little supplies, no company and little chance of survival. Being 50 million miles away and 4 years away in terms of rescue life seems bleak. Watney has to defy the odds in order to survive.Ridley Scott is responsible for so many wonderful films, and for many The Martian will sit among them.This is a beautifully made film, it looks incredible, I love the realisation of Mars's surface, truly brilliant, wasn't going to be otherwise with the budget they had. The music is interesting, the score itself is quite subtle, but the tunes from Abba, Gloria Estefan etc are so random.The pacing of the film is very cleverly done, never does it feel rushed, and on very few occasions does it feel slow or padded. If i'm honest at twenty minutes I was questioning how the film was possibly going to last over two hours.Matt Damon shows his class, he carries the film on his shoulders, he gives a stellar performance as Mark, cannot be faulted. Some of the others in the film were a little hit and miss, I enjoyed Chiwetel Ejiofor very much. Jeff Daniels was fairly good. Kristen Wiig seemed an odd choice, but she was good too.It was better then I expected, I enjoyed it a lot 8/10"
"The Martian, based on the novel of the same name written by author Andy Weir, is an eventful movie that serves both as an epic sci-fi adventure, but also provides viewers with some smart laughs. Those are who not that interested in sci-fi will probably end up liking the movie, because it is not unrealistic. Acting wise, Matt Damon puts in an excellent performance as the lead, and supporting actors such as Jessica Chastain, also put in solid performances. Probably one of the best aspects of the film, is that the mood of the movie is quite optimistic, considering that the situation of being stuck on mars, is quite a scary one, that requires a lot of panic. In Conclusion, The martian is a fun, smart movie, that is likely to be enjoyed by most audiences who watch it."
"This movie can be summed up with one word... vapid. As if Matt Damon's inherently vapid acting weren't bad enough, the makers of this film were so overtly focused on presenting an idyllic reality where no character behaves in any offensive way, to anybody, they produced an un-suspenseful, uninteresting, boring, vapid turd of a story. They fall over themselves to be so certain that no minority demographic is stereotyped that all characters have the sane vapid personality. And in what seems to be some sort of perverse effort to recompense reality, a very transparent hierarchy is followed to be certain that: the Black people are the most clever; the Hispanic people are next most clever; the Asian people are next most clever(carefully not portrayed as exceptionally smart), and of course the women are more clever than the men. Of course the only flawed demographic were older white male authority figures. To me this liberal, philosophical portrayal of what an ideal reality is reveals that they are the true bigots, the haters. They hate the differences that make people interesting. Ethnicity, femininity / masculinity, and their different traits should be loved and celebrated, not shamed, muted, or eliminated. It is the interaction of those differences that create an interesting story, not a vapid one."
"Spoilers below. The worst thing about about this movie was that everything is so hard to believe because it's such nonsense. It doesn't follow basic physic laws. It doesn't take much to get me invested in a movie as a viewer, but this just goes too far. The absolute worst flaw is not even all the fake science, nor I'd it the overuse of disco music or the fact that the astronaut doesn't really get desperate and only makes cheesy jokes... No, it's the fact that China's space program has some secret spaceship which they want to reveal and give up for the eyes of the world to save one unknown American dude. That just doesn't make any sense. First of all, China could care less, also, why give up a rocket on which you've been apparently working in secret, just to send food up to space? And if all this would happen for some strange reason... America responds with 'ok. I see. Thank you'. Hangs up and goes ' yessssssss.' Idiotic."
"Wow this was a bad one, I thought Interstellar was painful but this was even worse (I know hard to believe!) My favourite part in the whole movie was when Matt points out that an explosion which occurred in a particular room during an experiment he was conducting was due to (you'll love this!) him exhaling too much oxygen into the room! Correct me if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure we exhale CO2 and inhale O2. I think even a fifth grader would be able to tell me that. I nearly cried with laughter when I heard him say that line and how he kept a straight face is beyond me, unless he thinks its true of course.This was just the beginning of the lack of believable science in this movie and it was so painful to watch after more and more random unbelievable events started popping up. His one line killed the movie for me, from that point on I was looking for more ""errors"" and they just kept on coming.Anyway to cover the opening sequence with how poor Matt ends up left on Mars to die, well there's a big storm that no one seems coming, they all rush to their landing vehicle to hot tail it back up to their orbiting mothership. Matt gets a whack in the gut with something (which we later find out pierced his suit completely but yet somehow the suit manages to stay pressurised with a hole in it) and decides to pass out. The rest of the crew fly back up to the mothership and, get this, immediately set course for home! They don't stay in orbit for say another 24 hours and recover Matt's body they just leg it back home asap. Odd I thought for a NASA mission to just abandon him and not say bring the body back for his family to bury.When poor Matt wakes up he finds all the communications are down and all his friends gone. And by communications I mean the one satellite dish that was stuck to the habitat roof has blown down in the storm and been completely demolished, but not one of the solar panels outside is damaged, just a bit sandy. Seeing how comms back to Earth would be one of the critical systems would there not be 3 or 4 other methods of calling home, redundancies in case of a disaster? NASA didn't see the point in having any of those backups on this mission to Mars, what could possibly go wrong? Another good one is when he is told to drill and cut a whole in the roof of a perfectly airtight rover and sticky tape a big plastic balloon to the top of it. No reason is given for this yet it happens, I think it's so he can take some more plastic painting sheets with him but I cant be certain. Also wouldn't this drilling and cutting a big hole compromise the pressurisation integrity rendering the vehicle unsafe to drive around in without a space suite on, oh but not for Matt, he happily drives around Mars with no suit on at all with his new plastic sticky taped sunroof fitted trying to work out how far he can get on his batteries while whinging about how he'll never make it to the RV due to lack of power all the while singing along to the stereo with more flood lights turned on than at a football stadium. Um turn some crap off Matt that'll save you some juice.Again another scene in the movie, an airlock somehow gets blown to bits and a big gaping whole is left in the side of the habitat Matt lives in. The solution, a big piece of plastic sheet and more sticky tape, he then repressurises the habitat and somehow his sticky taped plastic painting sheet is able to hold up fine, outside there are wild storms going on (which are visible through a few of the more believable looking pressurised windows) raging away and not one single piece of debris punches through his plastic painting drop sheet or does any damage to his rover or solar panels.The mission to get him home is to send back the craft which ran away and left him in the beginning. NASA didn't tell the crew of the ship for months that he was still alive as they didn't want to hurt their feelings! So the plan to get him back is drive the mothership all the way back to Earth, do some gravity sling shot thing around Earth (sounds like Apollo 13?) rendezvous with a supplies pod (food and movies onboard probably) and fly all the way back to Mars and pick him up as he fires himself into space from a lander (after stripping out all the gear inside, removing the roof and covering it with another plastic painting sheet held on with sticky tape to save weight) already there for the next disastrous mission to Mars NASA has already cooked up.For me this movie just went too far, way beyond what any normal person with a even a tiny grasp of science can cope with. I cannot believe Ridley, NASA and JPL were happy to have their names mentioned let alone their relevant ground breaking departments portrayed with such a lack of any real science.I know it's a SciFi movie but you have to get the basics right and have some kind of explanation for the viewer to be able to buy into the ludicrous things which take place in the movie. Otherwise it just becomes a complete bore to watch and the viewer spends their time looking for more flaws.My opinion, save yourself the money, stay home, get a pizza in & watch Blade Runner on BluRay again :-)"
"I was waiting for this movie for a few weeks and was greatly disappointed when I finally watched it.It doesn't matter if the number of potatoes to survive is accurate, if you are using toxic rocket fuel to make water, you do not feel lonely and isolated, and you are not worried about oxygen - you are just having fun - isolated for 300-500 days without anyone or anything else around - the guy seems pretty comfortable and not worried.Impossible to connect with characters. Too many stereotypes. Blatant sales and marketing, actor and story picks for the sake of selling more tickets.I hope I will save my money and time, next movie like this comes out."
"This tedious family adventure film is the latest contribution to the popular and well established 'Where Are We Rescuing Matt H. Damon From This Week?' genre.I like Matt H. Damon, I really do. But he's been making it very difficult recently, and this 2+ hour marathon just doesn't help.Damon plays an astronaut accidentally marooned on Mars by a storm that literally could not happen because Mars lacks the necessary atmospheric conditions, where he must somehow survive with nothing but an unlimited supply of electricity, an unlimited supply of water, an entirely self- sufficient artificial habitat, half a dozen spare space suits, multiple land vehicles and probes (all in perfect working order), food supplies intended for half a dozen people, and a large quantity of magical potato seedlings that grow to maturity in just a few days despite a complete absence of soil nutrients.Since the first act establishes that Damon is so well set up he doesn't actually need rescuing, Ridley Scott fabricates a second act 'emergency' in a vain attempt to raise tension (it doesn't).Damon keeps in contact with Earth via a magical transmission technology that provides full HD streaming with no latency whatsoever, allowing him to have real time conversations with NASA headquarters, where everyone does and says whatever they want because there is no chain of command even though it's ostensibly run by Jeff Daniels (played by Jeff Daniels).His fellow astronauts remain hovering above Mars, beaming their own HD stream to NASA by the use of a magical camera that automatically homes in on Damon regardless of where he is on the planet.NASA builds a brand new rocket from scratch in less than 14 days so they can send Damon a fresh load of unlimited supplies. It explodes immediately after takeoff because Ridley Scott still has another hour to fill. Meanwhile Damon accidentally blows up his potatoes.NASA's lone Chinese employee suddenly remembers that his uncle has a private rocket he's never got around to using, so they phone China and ask if NASA can borrow it. The uncle agrees so the Chinese government sends it into space immediately, where it is instead caught by Damon's astronaut colleagues, who nick all the supplies.Meanwhile Damon is travelling to the other side of the planet, where he intends to escape using a previously unsuspected bonus rocket that just happens to be lying around the place in perfect working order. Damon can't carry his unlimited supply of water and only has enough room in his vehicle for a few sandwiches, but by a remarkable stroke of luck it turns out that his body is capable of indefinite peak physical performance despite minimal hydration and a complete lack of nutrition, so that's OK. Also it turns out that the gravity on Mars is exactly the same as Earth's, so he hasn't lost any muscle tone.Damon arrives at the bonus rocket and is told by NASA that it's actually too heavy to lift off the planet despite being designed for that exact purpose (???) The only solution is to remove the nose of the rocket, which is actually easier than it sounds because the entire spacecraft is made of Lego and can be easily disassembled by a single undernourished man with no tools.With the nose of the rocket removed, Damon risks being killed by the extreme physical pressure generated by takeoff. NASA points out that a simple tarpaulin is strong enough to protect him, so he finds a spare one from... somewhere... and straps it on.Damon's fellow astronauts pair their ship with his rocket using Bluetooth, and take over the controls. Damon is almost crushed to a pulp as the rocket leaves Mars, because it turns out that tarpaulin isn't as strong as industrial steel after all.Somebody on the astronauts' ship blows something up because of reasons, and this somehow makes it easier for one of them to rescue Damon, who has jumped out of his rocket and is now flying towards their ship with the aid of a hole in the finger of his space suit and an unlimited supply of pressurised oxygen.NASA is helpfully streaming this heroic rescue to the entire planet using their magical realtime HD stream, because of course they are.Damon and his fellow astronauts arrive home safely just a few hours later, and Damon is rewarded with a free pair of glasses. Henceforth, everyone must call him 'Doctor.' Because doctors have glasses.I rate The Martian at 13.32 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a mediocre 4/10 on IMDb."
"Boy, I haven't hated a movie this much in a long time. I actually just joined IMDb (I have been a long term viewer) in order to vent this out of my system, and to express my amazement that this terrible, vapid, cliché movie won a Golden Globe and is nominated for the Oscar best movie of the year. What the heck is going on? Are Aliens sucking the brain matter out of us little by little so that we actually think this tripe is not only good, but great? A script a high schooler could have written, bad acting, terrible dialogue, one dimensional characters you don't care about, bad disco music, overly politically correct casting, mistakes in basic ""science"", stupid hap-hap-happy ending where everyone in the world (literally) is jumping, smiling and hugging each other, I could go on and on. This movie was so bad we actually kept watching it, like the morbid curiosity of looking at an auto accident. My favorite line of the movie was when Jeff Daniels said that the Matt Damon character would be fine with his supplies ""as long as nothing goes wrong"". I looked at my husband and said sarcastically ""Gee, I wonder if something is going to go wrong"", and wouldn't you know it, in the very next scene it does. We have sworn off any future Ridley Scott movies, for good. He is obviously in cahoots with the Aliens sucking out all our brain matter."
"Do not trust any review above 2 stars. I think such users are payed reviewers.I went to watch this ""movie"" not expecting much, but what i get was a total frustration. I'd like to get a refund for the ticked i payed because i felt cheated. The movie is insulting to human intelligence. Totally pointless, superficial and from a scientific point of view, is an insult to every scientist. In addition i hope the NASA will call the production to a courtyard for how they have been represented in the movie. Acting is quite often terrible too, no psychological immersion, all is a joke and with a little montage everything become possible... this movie is a waste of money and time, i want my money back!!!Do not waste money and time over this one!THE SPOILER PART REAT AT YOUR OWN DISCRECTION: Think about : 1- growing potato over a soil not tested fertilized with astronauts ""poo""... what about bacteria ? What about soil minerals and PH ? ... why he had potatoes in a martian station? (that's a joke)2- why there is no scientific team studying and calculating ? Just a bunch of guys wandering around saying ""yes"" to the big boss or the minor actor acting like the ""genius"" ?? 3- No information control at the NASA center??? Are you kidding me ??? An astronauts left alone over mars, does a real-time chatting with a ""guy"" (not even a psychologist) and such conversations are real-time public shared !!!! ARE YOU F*****G KIDDIN ME????? 4- sorry i forgot to mention that in such movie radiation are totally ignored, as you will never see the reflecting visor down even in ""free space"" while glancing at sunThere are tons of those nonsenses in the movie... i just have time to write down 4, but all the movie is 2 hours of such nonsenses.TO CONCLUDE: this ""movie"" is an insult to the viewer, who liked it does ignore even the basic concepts of science, a terrible superficial plot. This ""movie"" is a scam, a fraud to steal our money. I've been cheated, listen to me and don't be fooled keep you time and money for something better."
"because I care about the future, I looked forward to this movie. But while i watched it, it was a struggle to make it to the end. I'm very disappointed. Easily i blame the director, but there is a bigger production team who failed. They created a film of shallow, lame, cliché stereotypes with bad developed characters.It's all about the hero. It's not about ""Matt Damon in his best role"". When he's suppose to be funny, it's the worst. Jessica Chastain was brilliant in Interstellar, so now she lights up another successful chapter of imaginary human spaceflight ? Sorry, I much more think of a massive loss of image.If you wish to make future NASA look smart, cute and sexy, do not pick Jeff Daniels as it's director ! Every time 'Teddy' shows up, I expected Jim Carrey dancing to the disco sound. It wasn't even funny once to blame Lewis for her taste of music, and it wasn't funny to blame her again and again. Please, Mister Scott, if you grab one more time into the box of stereotypes and transform actors like Sean Bean, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain and Michael Peña into fools: retire ! Thank you.P. S. Hold on, you didn't fail on Mackenzie Davis, she made NASA look cute."
"First off I just want to stress that this is absolutely the kind of film you want to see on the big screen; don't wait for it to come out on DVD! The Mars landscape is truly stunning and the visual effects look fantastic.I didn't really know what to expect when walking into the cinema today. I knew it was about some guy getting stuck on Mars, but that's about it. I had no idea that what I was about to watch would end up being one of my favourite movies of the year.The whole of planet Earth is trying to help Mark get home after he's been left behind on Mars and presumed dead. You can clearly see the emotion of those at the NASA command centre who are pulling all their resources together to make it work. The dedication and loyalty of Mark's crew is captivating as they come up with an idea to supersede NASA's original plan and swing the Hermes around the Earth and back towards Mars to pick their fellow astronaut up.And, of course, there are Mark's struggles on Mars. This botanical genius of an astronaut is forced to grow his own food and ration his resources so that he can survive long enough for help to arrive. His creativity, innovations, and breadth of knowledge undoubtedly save his life in this impossible situation. I lost count of how many times the cinema erupted into laughter. There were so many clever lines and witty comments that you couldn't leave the cinema without a smile on your face. But despite the comedy, this film was able to be very gripping and tense when it needed to be: Mark removing the shrapnel from his stomach, NASA's failed attempt to launch the supply probe, the malfunction in the base on Mars leading to all of his work being ruined, and the Hermes crew desperately trying everything they can to readjust their course towards Mark are all great examples of where The Martian excels dramatically.I also really liked that they were able to show the effect of such severe rationing: Mark loses substantial weight and muscle (I know it was a body-double, but still the effect is the same). In addition, the visible tooth decay was a nice touch which just goes to show how polished and attentive to detail the film is.Needless to say, the cast was phenomenal: Matt Damon (Bourne), Jeff Daniels (The Newsroom), Sean Bean (Game of Thrones), Kate Mara (House of Cards), and Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave) just to name a few.Several of the criticisms I have seen of this film are, to me, actually its strengths: the main protagonist who isn't concerned with his family back home (thank goodness it wasn't another cliché where he has a family that he oh-so-desperately needs to get back to), the length of the film (Interstellar, I would say, was bordering on too long, whereas Gravity seemed a bit short - The Martian felt just right), and the comedic element (to me, the comedy is what makes this film stand out - it is integral to its success - just like with The Edge of Tomorrow).And, as with all Ridley Scott films, the pacing was excellent. The plot didn't seem too rushed, but it didn't drag on either. Perfectly executed.If you enjoy good storytelling, excellent acting, stunning visuals, comedy, drama, and survival, then you can be sure to enjoy this movie as much as I did!"
"Man, I was so disappointed by this movie! Did I have too high expectations? I don't think so. If you have a bunch of actually Hollywood-A-class actors and a director who made ""Blade Runner"" and ""Alien"", you are officially allowed to have expectations! But they all failed terribly in my opinion. I could rant about the bad jokes, the awful soundtrack and the cheesy 3D-renderings - why didn't they manage one single time to make these things, the ship, the rover, actually look big? It all looked like toys! Awful! But my biggest complaint is the terrible storytelling! The movie had zero suspense from beginning to end. It was always, hey we have a problem, let's have a cool dialog/monologue, and then, hey, we'll solve the problem within the next minute - no problem at all! Hey, I got no milk in the fridge, OK I'll get some from the supermarket... That level of depth. I didn't feel for one single minute with the main character and I couldn't have cared less, when he had died in the end. There was at some points emotional music and we all were told, that this and that is dangerous and what not. But I couldn't feel it at all. Just for comparison: ""Gravity"" had me on the edge of the seat and ""Interstellar"" had me hold my breath. Not to mention ""Moon"", ""Blade Runner"" and ""Odyssee"". Wasn't there a time, when Ridley Scott made actually great movies? Do yourself a favor and spend the money on something else. This movie isn't worth it."
"The Martian (2015) directed by Ridley Scott, written by Drew Goddard, based on the novel by Andy Weir. This is not the film you think it is. To elaborate, the premise of the The Martian suggests a tale about one man's solitary struggle against seemingly insurmountable odds as he overcomes one hurdle after another while stranded on Mars. Isolated and detached from humanity in every sense of the word we would expect to see a mans emotional and intellectual battle with this overbearing desolation and the pain of never seeing his loved ones again. However, in stark contrast to this what we get is an eternally optimistic film with a persistently upbeat, wise-cracking protagonist set to a soundtrack of '70s disco music. The tone is consistently light throughout, save for a few fleeting moments such as when Matt Damon's character mentions his parents on earth or the brief moments when something doesn't quite go to plan at NASA. When they do encounter a problem it's resolved so quickly it scarcely seems to have posed any threat. The films insistence on never getting weighed down by it's subject matter unfortunately means that it fails to produce any real tension. From very early on in the film it's clear that everything will be OK by the end, one way or another this astronaut is getting home safe, that much you can be sure on. Consequently what we have then is an entertaining, easy to watch space travel story in which we watch an astronaut devise some nifty scientific devices to help him survive in his man made habitat while he waits for NASA to rescue him. There are several scenes where Damon's character actually seems to be enjoying himself. The character development is paper thin, he starts of a self assured, relatively cheerful every-man who endears himself to us almost instantly. By the end of the film he remains exactly that, his harrowing experience of surviving a harsh alien wasteland after being left for dead by his crew has failed to instill even the slightest sense of self-reflection or introspective behavior. The question then remains, does this make it a 'bad' film? My answer is no. It's just not what you'd expect from a Ridley Scott sci-fi. It's an easy going film with a likable protagonist, a healthy dose of humour with just a touch of sentimentality. I will say that I appreciated that we had both a female captain leading the space crew and not even the slightest hint of an unnecessary romantic subplot. Adjust your expectations and you'll have a good time. If, however, you were hoping for a masterpiece of suspense that brilliantly captures the terrifying dangers of space, Scott already made that film in 1979."
"This movie is so science-y. You will just love how much it quotes science. Like, you know, real science. And that is why I loved this movie. Science tells us that everything in it is totally possible. Anybody who doesn't like this movie must be anti-science. Because science rules. It's like Neil DeGrasse Tyson and Bill Nye had a love child. And Carl Sagan.But don't just go for all the science. The story is so unique. I know Matt Damon just famously played a brilliant NASA astronaut who got stranded on a planet in the movie Interstellar, and that Jessica Chastain was also in that one, but it is not like Interstellar at all (what was with that weird ending, anyway??). The Martian has its own unique plot centered around a team of brilliant NASA scientists in Houston trying to get their astronauts home after a difficult journey that had to be cut short, but it is not like Apollo 13. Sure, in both movies they don't have enough fuel, and there is an explosion on board, and they have to use this brilliantly hatched scheme to use gravitational pull to propel them. But get this: while Apollo 13 had its astronauts being propelled around the moon, The Martian has them going around Earth! Science says that the earth is way bigger than the moon, which makes this way cooler. Nope, not at all like the entire movie Apollo 13. Oh, and also, there is a great part at the end that made me feel just like I was watching Gravity again. You'll know the part when you see it. But really it is nothing like Gravity.It is so funny through the whole movie when Matt Damon explains everything in minute detail as it happens. Such a brilliant choice by the writer and director. Exposition like that is so scientific because he has to know all those big words in order to explain everything. I can imagine all the anti-science global warming deniers' heads exploding at these parts, but if you're anything like me, you will find yourself nodding along and thinking, ""Yep! I know what he's talking about!"" Example: that moment he had to make his own water and he said, ""Fortunately, I know the recipe. Take hydrogen. Add oxygen. Burn."" So true!Again, The Martian is a smart, complex movie. Luckily, in another brilliant choice by director Ridley Scott, title cards appear at the beginning of nearly every scene explaining where the action is taking place, and who is taking part in it. I found this extremely helpful, as it was a bit confusing when it would switch from Mars to Earth all the time. Plus, it was extremely gratifying when I would see a new character, and before I even had time to think who the heck is that, lo and behold, his or her name and title would appear to clear away all doubt.Then there's the music: So many familiar tunes!And I've been hearing a lot about perhaps the most quotable line of any movie for years—you know the line—let me just say it because it is so funny: ""I'm gonna have to science the s*** out of this."" --That is said by Matt Damon's character, Mark Watney, who is literally one of the smartest and most capable men ever. But as you can tell, he isn't all stuffy, you know? He is really funny. Can I just quote some more of his hilarious lines? I couldn't stop laughing the whole way through as he smugly said these things to the audience, I mean his camera:""Hi, I'm Mark Watney and I'm still alive... obviously.""""I don't want to come off as arrogant here, but I'm the greatest botanist on this planet.""""Mars will come to fear my botany powers.""""So yeah, I'm f***ed.""""In your face, Neil Armstrong!""""Tell Commander Lewis, disco sucks."" ""F***!""""So I blew myself up.""""Mark Watney: Space Pirate.""""I admit it's fatally dangerous, but I'd get to fly around like Iron Man.""""F*** you, Mars.""Anyway, he is hilarious as you can tell, and this movie definitely deserves all the praise it is getting for its humor alone. You will just love this.Ten/Ten ""Stars"" (Get it?)"
"After sleeping through Gravity and laughing through Interstellar, (a fine unintentional comedy if ever there was one), it's good to see a contemporary Sci-fi tell the story well - and do the science right.I am not a big Matt Damon fan, mainly because of his loudmouthed lefty nonsense and his limited acting range, but he was very good in this. The support cast were also excellent, especially the always compelling black guy who I can't spell the name of and Harry Dunne.There was some unfortunate pandering by Sir Ridley to the PC brigade, which the film could have done without. The Gen-Y unhygienic (accurate), disorganised, (accurate), disrespectful (accurate), black guy, who also happened to be an astrodynamics genius rocket scientist, (inaccurate), was a poor casting choice. Also to suggest the Chinese would give a fat rat's crack about an American astronaut....at the expense of their state rocket-technology secrets....is laughably far-fetched. Probably more far fetched than flying into space in a roofless/windowless capsule.But putting the film's failings aside, at least Ridley told a good story, laced it with plenty of well-explained science, spliced it with genuine humour and soaked it in amazing vistas of the Martian landscape. Plus he showed that if you put a woman in charge of a dangerous mission, she will ultimately fail. This degree of honesty is refreshing, in an age where every second antagonist is a flimsy female (beating up men ten times her size), or a female weapons expert/assassin/whatever.Show em as they are, Ridley. Well done.All in all a great film where I expected a load of boring tripe.8/10."
"The Ares III manned mission encounters a sand storm on Mars. Astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is left for dead as the rest of the crew evacuate on their spacecraft. Mission control back on Earth is shocked when they discover that Mark is actually alive and alone on Mars.Simply put, this is a fun space adventure. There is a good deal of Apollo 13 and Gravity. Damon is humorous and engaging. Meanwhile, the mission control back on earth is doing interesting things. Nobody is the villain. Jeff Daniels is a capable bureaucratic leader. Chiwetel Ejiofor gives the team intensity and has fun scenes with Mackenzie Davis. Almost every side character adds to the group. As for the spacecraft, it's interesting to have Jessica Chastain as the commander. The entire cast is great. The whole story is thrilling. There are unexpected turns. It has the feel of reality. A lot of praise has to be given to director Ridley Scott for a well constructed film. Also it's genius to give it a disco soundtrack."
"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning During an outer space mission around Mars, astronaut Matt Watney (Matt Damon) is separated from his spacecraft, and is presumed dead in the immediate aftermath. Stranded many light years from his home planet, Mark is forced to use his survival training (including fertilising faeces for food!) in order to survive, before managing to contact Earth and bring news of his survival to NASA president Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels), who desperately works on Earth with scientist Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) to get him home, while re-assuring a frantic public.Having made his name in a landmark sci-fi classic many decades ago, Ridley Scott returns to the genre for a film where the only alien appears to be in human form. His ability to create an impressive visual spectacle doesn't seem to have diminished with time, and The Martian features some sets and designs in outer space that could quite blow your mind. The director oversteps any meaningful character development, and plunges us straight into a story that serves as a lengthier rendition of 2013's Gravity, with elements of Tom Hanks's Cast Away chucked in for good measure.For a film stretching at nearly two and a half hours, it really needed not just an interesting story, but an effective screenplay to match it. While the 'one man stranded in space' plot still has some life in it, Scott seems overly preoccupied with stuffing Damon's Watson character full of insightful technical jargon and waffle, to reassure us he's highly intelligent and 'NASA's finest', to the point of disconnection. To try and balance the script with some humour, Scott has displayed an affection for '70s disco music, which Damon must awkwardly eschew. It's a welcome touch, if not truly effective.Performances wise, Damon must carry the lengthy film almost singlehandedly, and it's his varying degrees as an actor that make as little or most of this. While a better actor could have made more of it, by turns a weaker actor could have made it worse, and so you're grateful for small mercies. In what could be the main supporting role, Daniels is grounded as the head of NASA but, in a film determined to have as much humour as drama, that role he took with Jim Carrey all those years ago (and recently reprised) can never get out your mind. A further colourful supporting cast further make it up, including Michael Pena, Sean Bean and Ejiofor.Overall, it's not an entirely unsuccessful film, just one without the genuine tension and suspense to really make it last as long as it does, and so the cracks do appear at times. ***"
"I went to see the martian with high expectations,hoping to get a story that will take you by your throat keeps you on the tip of your seat and thrill you,surprise you...etc etc...i got nothing of the above!! instead i watched a very dull,predictable and very safe movie,Matt Damon,i really love as an actor but he never got to me,i simply was not taken by his acting,it just did not come across,the surrounding characters were so predictable,the young and beautiful captain,another young chick and a science head...the happy Latino...a German...oh please give me a break,who wrote this,and sorry to say but the name Ridley Scott seems to disappoint me more and more the last years.The scene where his garden gets blown away i saw coming from a mile,the science well,that was nicely done for a 10year your kid,but for me it looked like a Sunday afternoon cable movie,safe and predictable.There were so many things they could have done differently,also the music did nothing good for it.the photography could have been done so much better...i am very disappointed."
"I watched this movie with a friend who has no technical background, and she pronounced it good. I should note that my friend is Canadian, and with the possible exception of Neil Young, Canadians are an innately polite people.Meanwhile, being American, I was laughing internally until I spotted. I also note that I knew the author of the book (when he was a kid) through a workplace and personal friendship with his father. Andy Weir is an incredibly gifted science geek, as is his dad. I therefore know that none of the gross scientific transgressions in the film can be blamed on his ignorance. Andy openly admits to willfully ignoring a few things like the thin Martian atmosphere in the interest of moving the story forward. He correctly understood the impatience of miseducated Americans with annoyances such as basic laws of physics. IOW, he took the movie money and ran, like the smart kid I know him to be. So I would say that any idiotic disregard of science on screen—the use of Visqueen and duct tape to secure a 6 foot hole vacated by (richly ironic) a blown hatch cover against a 50,000 pound pressure gradient, for example—resulted either from production or directorial indifference. The list of anti-Newtonian horrors goes on, and gets funnier, particularly when Matt Damon punctures his space glove and uses the escaping oxygen to propel himself toward his rescuer. Next, I was half expecting the crew of the rescuing spacecraft to line up, bend over, and torch off an ensemble fart to correct a course deviation.In any case, this movie was not intended to portray a real human battle against nature, as was so wonderfully chronicled in Apollo 13.Rather, The Martian was intended to make money by playing on current themes of political correctness and the warm fuzzies of international cooperation, framed by the awesomeness of space.It fails spectacularly even at this wretched goal—not at making money, you understand, but the furtherance of World Peace—placing its bets on star power, flaccid dialogue, dumbass jokes and cheap CGI effects instead of a solid script, good acting and a credible stab at realism. Jeff Daniels as the director of NASA? My God...Watch this movie only if you're looking for something to distract you from doing something more useful, such as expressing the dog's impacted anal glands.Higher emotional content can be found by chopping up an onion."
"From the earliest days of cinema, films have explored what man can do when cut off from society (and indeed, the interest of the topic pre-dates the art form: think how long ago Robinson Crusoe was written). But in a world ever more monitored, depictions of life beyond borders are often set in space. These include both fictional tales and true stories. 'Apollo 13', for example, is a riveting film, but mainly because of its raw material: in 1971, a manned space mission suffered from an explosion and the astronauts were stranded, thousands of miles from help; amazingly, they managed to fix their stricken craft and make it home alive.'The Martian' is a fictional story, but is in some ways Apollo 13-redux. It starts with a gripping scene where, post-disaster, the hero is forced to operate on himself: gripping, yes, but also not a scene that needs to be set on Mars. And subsequently, it can't quite live up to this compelling start. As I see it, there are three main problems. Firstly, some implausible science (how can you grow plants without carbon dioxide in the atmosphere?) and psychology (the story is set over a period of years, but we never really get the impression that the character is stranded alone for so long). Secondly, the need for the Hollywood virtues where force of character compels eventual triumph. And finally, perhaps, that the remarkable thing about Apollo 13 is not that its crew could have saved themselves, but that they did: the triumph was not one over the laws of physics, but rather a win against the odds. In a fictional story, this is a less compelling narrative structure: why does the character get repeatedly lucky? Simply because the screenwriters wrote it that way.Yet in spite of its faults, the film's basic set up draws you in, and by the (admittedly melodramatic) rescue scenes, one can't help but watch on the edge of one's seat; and keeping an audience interested for over two hours is not such an easy thing to do. Perhaps the fact that in the real world we've basically given up on manned space travel adds to the appeal: this may be a futuristic story, but at the same time, it also feels like a tale of something we used to do, to boldly go beyond the limits of our planet to see what we might find."
"The movie ""The Martian"" is about an astronaut, Mark Watney who got stuck on Mars. It is a movie based on a novel by Andy Weir and the main character is played by Matt Damon. How did he survive after the accident? Let's find out.This movie began with a big sand storm. The Ares crew and Mark Watney were collecting samples of stones and dirt, when suddenly a sand storm came. Mark and the crew were separated by it. A metal stick stabbed Mark's body and the crew thought Mark was dead. To protect the other crew members, the commander forced the crew to abort the mission and Mark was left behind on Mars! The following day, when Mark woke up, he found he was alone on Mars. He wanted to survive on Mars; it's lucky that Mark is a botanist, he knew how to grow potatoes and make water by himself. He began to survive on this planet with very little water or food.One day, an engineer named Mindy Park found two satellite photos were different; the solar panels had been moved! The director Vincent Kapoor knew that Mark had survived. They wanted to save Mark's life, but the NASA director Teddy Sanders didn't agree. To rescue Mark, Mitch Henderson, who was the flight director of the Ares 3 Mission, used a special code to tell the Ares crew that Mark was still alive. Mitch wanted the crew to decide if they wanted to save Mark or not.In the end, the crew and Mark meet again. I felt so excited about their reunion. I liked the movie very much! The CG and story-line are very interesting, but most of all, the music - disco - is my favorite! I love it so much!"
"As always, Riddley Scott delivered another visually beautiful science fiction piece, with all the ingredients to make it a commercial success.From top acting names, to state of the art VFX, there is not much bad that you could say about this movie. Unfortunately, the fact is that this story is not really new. In fact it is really old. A guy stranded on a desolate inhospitable place, who tries to survive against all odds? Come on!! I would go to see this movie with different expectations, it it wasn't so heavily advertised as a masterpiece. Which it really isn't. The movie is just fun, with sprinkle of comedy and heavy dose of pathetic closeups of Matt, Jessica and rest of the crew. I guess all that money spent had to payoff, so what's better way than to make it appealing to wide audience, from kids to grandparents. And that is OK. But I cannot escape the feeling that R. Scott has lost the pace with modern times, and brought a little archaic style to this movie. Satisfied but not impressed. That is my final judgement.Good 2 hrs of fun."
"I stopped watching after Matt Damon said, ""In the face of overwhelming odds, I'm left with only one option: I'm gonna have to science the $hit out of this."" I wouldn't be surprised if NASA scientists and the ghost of Carl Sagan weren't collectively cringing after hearing this horrible drivel. Do they think this is clever writing, or are they just too lazy to write something good? Why don't they just have the actors say, ""Yada yada yada, rocket propulsion, blah blah blah, Mars, something, something, science...""I've said it before: I think Hollywood should just give up all pretense and film one of their over-paid, self-important ""actors"" to sit on a toilet for 2 hours. It couldn't be any worse than this movie or most of the other garbage they keep churning out in order to separate us peasants from our hard-earned money."
"I had low expectations of this film, and not to my surprise, my expectations where more then fulfilled.After watching this terrible movie, I looked up the reviews on the Internet and was disappointed that so many reviews of sites and movie-critics where so positive. It felt like I was truly alone on this world. For me, the movie was sh*t, but everyone thinks it was great. Wat is wrong with me. But today, I started reading the reviews of some fellow IMDb- reviewers, and finally I see what is wrong. Only an intelligent person would perceive this movie as cr*p, but since most people are morons, that explains all the positive reviews.I can only perceive this waste of pellicule as a promotion-movie for NASA. They probably want to gear up to get more tax-payer money for their upcoming research to get people to Mars. Believe me, this will be money wasted. People will never walk on Mars, seeing the current situation on this planet.The movie was a travesty, where science and doing the math was used as a continuous red line to explain everything. I really didn't see any math or science in this movie. It was more like a lotto contestant who won every game, against all odds.The astronaut was a botanist. WHAT??? That was the easy part. Planting some potato's in Mars-dust, and fertilize them with sh*t, in a dark environment does not give you a full 100% harvest of potato-plants. Believe me, I have done the math, in earth soil. He was also a doctor, an electronics engineer, a chemist, a programmer, a mechanic, a psychologist and what what more. An astronaut for me, should be a civil engineer, with a specialization in whatever field in science, but certainly NOT a botanist. Unbelievable.And where did he get all of his oxygen? After getting his helmet ruptured and taping it off, he was down to 10% oxygen, but after a few seconds all was back to normal. Heh?If you want more discrepancies, read some more reviews with low stars. This film is full of it.Ridiculous Scott, stop making more movies, you seem to suffer of the self-delusion that you are a Sci-Fi director.Nuff said."
"1st of all, the premise is all wrong, so there is no suspended disbelief effect here. Therefore, the rest of the movie becomes less than believable. BTW, I ""appreciate"" the whole re-use and abuse of the ""Aliens"" concepts and designs in the initial titles and the crew quarters appearances. Awesome. Reuse/Recycle. No new ideas there.A whole manned mission to Mars couldn't include a way to observe the Martian weather (this being possible for tens of years as we speak) and to land safely at a nice, wind-safe crater or to anchor a return vehicle securely enough? REALLY? And once a bit of a storm blew, the entire crew had to hurry back to Earth? ALL THE WAY BACK? They could not stay in the Martian orbit for a few hours even to make sure that they didn't leave anyone behind? WHAT? The orbit became dangerous too because of some storm? Am I the only one who could not believe that the hatches would seal nicely in a sand/rock/what's not storm? There was no two-way comm with any crew members? Once someone got blown away, then it was the end for him/her? Even on Earth this sounds dumb. Cool crappy, unrealistic suits! No real protection, funny boots, no visible means of backpacked life-support, lots of light blinding the users inside helmets and no light (as well as no two-way comm) for the actual work?! Then, no one could keep a communication satellite in the Martian orbit? So that no one would have to reinvent the wheel it order to communicate between the surface and the command center??? No further comments here.Kudos to the political correctness lawyers. They didn't miss one single detail. The manned mission to Mars includes the politically correct balance of males and females, they got a Mexican, a German (seriously???), and then the entire NASA's Martian program has the necessary number of very respectfully black Hindus and other African Americans. Good Job! Then there is the necessary number of Asians gets involved. And the Chinese government decides what's wrong with the whole rescue mission. Nice.Considering that neither NASA nor the Chinese can STILL fly anything worth a rat's jazz into space without the Russian-made tech, it is funny to see the whole story without any Russian involvement. Even the privately funded SpaceX program seems more effective these days than NASA! Nice political BS, holly-crap-wood.Look. I have given up expecting anything even closely serious from Hollywood. Yes, this movie is another all-time-low. Thank you for producing another piece of expensive garbage intended for people who practically kill one another on each ""black Friday"". I hope that those zombies enjoy this kind of BS. Ridley Scott, you, Sir, are a talent-less waste. Please, retire already. O&O."
"SPOILERS*******************Ten reasons why THE MARTIAN didn't work.10. They tried to make it funny. Matt Damon is not funny, except that one time he was a puppet in Team America: World Police. 9. 1990's quality special effects. Couldn't they have hired the effects guy from GRAVITY? Or even watched GRAVITY to see what a space movie looks like in 2015? 8. The main character had no back story. None. Zip. We know nothing about this guy who we are supposed to be rooting on. Except in a random voice over where he said he loved his parents. And that he was the ""best botanist on Mars..."" I actually hoped they would leave stranded so he could glib himself into the next solar system. 7. The device of the voice over was him talking directly into camera a la THE REAL WORLD - again a 1990's device - known from this day forward as ""The Pipe Cam"" where Damon would lay out exposition mixed with a bag full of bad jokes. (My guess is this: these clams were pitched by Damon himself because SEE REASON 10) 6. The supporting cast was dreadfully miscast with special accolades for horribleness to the other astronauts, and (the usually terrific) Jeff Daniels. Daniels must have made this film while doing NEWSROOM and forgot to change characters while walking from one sound stage to another. I'm never going to Michigan if this is what happens to a man. (Chiwetel Ejiofor had the only compelling performance. But that's no surprise) The film's best actor was Damon's ""skinny"" body double who happened to be a foot taller than Damon, but this guy could dry his hair to cover his face until Matt could put his space suit back on like nobody's business. If he hadn't been a 70 year-old John Holmes body double, you never would have guessed it wasn't Damon. 5. The soundtrack was wall-to-wall disco. Yes, disco. Yes, wall-to-wall disco. Which we had finally KILLED by the 90's. 2 hours of disco left behind by the sadistic Commander of the mission. There's even an ABBA song! And I paid $15 dollars to listen to this. The on-the-nose but BEST disco song plays over the closing credits. Not the first disco song where they roll the cast and A.D.'s credits that everyone in LA stays to see. No the second half over the caterers and ""Mr. Damon's assistant"" credits. The song was I WILL SURVIVE by Gloria Gaynor meant not for the fact that Damon survived, but that WE DID SURVIVE this entire film. Damon's character even jokes about the lameness of the disco, but... 4. Matt Damon is NOT funny! So now we're stuck with bad jokes told by an unfunny actor and lots of bad disco. AND I'm sitting next to some old broad whose hearing aid has fallen out of her ear and she doesn't even notice. So Helen Keller here has scammed Medicare for $500 or whatever a Costco hearing aid runs for these days. The aid apparently has a two second delay because I get to hear disco and bad jokes twice. If I had filled my empty popcorn bucket with water, pulled my t-shirt over my face and had my wife dump it on my mouth and nose it wouldn't have been as tortuous as this movie. Not that water-boarding is torture, but you get it... 3. Derivative. Seen it a hundred times: when Damon successfully docks with his returning shipmates (who had abandoned him, ostensibly because he is so damn annoying) the film cuts from one foreign city to another where Times Square type crowds are rooting on the American as they watch the happenings on their own Jumbotron. Russia, France, communist China rooting for America. America. Right. Another example is they lifted an entire scene where Damon operates on himself removing a piece of antennae which is a beat-for-beat rip-off of Javier Bardim removing a bullet from his leg in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN. Only Damon didn't have to blow up a car outside a drugstore for an opiate because... 2. Damon has his own pharmacy at the space camp. When things look grave he resorts to drug abuse. He breaks open a Vicodin, rubs a potato in it, looks into his Pipe Cam and tells us, ""I ran out of cat sup 3 weeks ago."" It made no sense, so I assumed it was another joke. Because as we all know.... 1. MATT DAMON IS NOT FUNNY."
"What is it about directors that they have to stoop to the very worst of clichés when making ""space"" films? I'm old enough to have seen ""2001"" when it first came out and it seems to me that far from emulating Kubrick's marvellous film Ridley Scott has regressed to some kind of Boy's Own adventure movies style - but peopled with every kind of PC cliché and dialogue that constantly sets this viewer's teeth on edge. Here's the scruffy ethnic that lives in a pile of mess but has worked out how to save the stranded astronaut - and develops his idea in the most childish way even though most of us had worked it out a good hour beforehand, Gruff Sean Bean growls and fights against the system. Pretty female astronauts are in control, a teenage NASA technician (female) spots something none of the more experienced men in real life would have noticed at the drop of a hat, the hideously white NASA director is stupid but the USA's new friends - the Chinese - come to the rescue. The scenes of jubilation in Times Square, Trafalgar Square and somewhere in China with massed crowds waiting with bated breath as the ""live"" rescue mission is beamed directly on to large screens is just pure nonsense. Pretty landscapes. Pity about the people, the dialogue, the plot and the suffocating PC-ness of it all."
"2 hours and 21 minutes of Matt Damon gardening, and people at NASA discussing how to rescue him. Seriously. That's the whole movie. Total boredom.Just so you know, I like all kinds of movies. I'm not impatient. I have a degree in a tech field. But geez, this movie is soooo boring.And it's stupid!! And the casting is terrible. A 22-year-old hot model-type woman is the only one at NASA smart enough to locate Damon. And a 22-year-old slob who looks like he's strung-out on drugs (rolling out of a bed in his FILTHY MESSY office, twitching, shaking, stuttering) is the only one at NASA smart enough to think of using a slingshot-effect for the rocket. But they're SOOOO smart that they can attend high-level, and I'm talking the highest level on a national scale....they can attend these meetings in street clothes, while everyone else is in suits and ties.I know Damon is extremely politically-correct, and so are most Hollywood movies these days. But this one goes too far. Literally every scene alternates between a person of a different race. White, African-American, African, Hispanic, Asian, Middle Eastern. And every scene has a man and a woman in it. Michael Pena as an astronaut?? Hello....do I really need to explain that you have to be in-shape to be an astronaut??"
"Science fiction has been one of the genres churned out many times, most turning into capers with few exceptions like Apollo 13 or Gravity. ""The Martian"" isn't a caper nor does it delve into the sentimentality of ""Apollo 13"" or ""Gravity."" It's simply a clever and entertaining sci-fi drama that contemplates the scientific facts meticulously. The story seems more for pleasing the crowd rather than accomplishing a rich literary work; but whatever it does seem flawless and detailed for which the film becomes gripping throughout despite its over length. Based on a novel of the same title, the film pretty enriches your knowledge on astronomy for which it can serve a very good resourcce. Matt Damon in the title role steals the show using much of wit to his role, avoiding sentimentality, and above all, tries something different than the desolation portrayed by Tom Hanks in Cast Away or Leonardo Di Caprio in ""The Revenant."" His role is pretty fun filled and amusing; a memorable performance he has given in recent years after 'The Departed."" A superb narration, brilliant camera work, and a nice performance definitely make it a smart and entertaining movie of the year though the subject and treatment might not feel a regular Oscar worthy material.Rating: 2.5 stars out of 4"
"Fascinating and enthralling tale of resourcefulness, ingenuity and survival.After a massive storm forces his crew to leave the planet, an astronaut, Mark Watney (played by Matt Damon), is marooned on Mars, and presumed dead. Figuring that it would be at least four years until someone can rescue him, he sets out, though often ingenious means, to survive..A very well thought-out and made movie from director Ridley Scott. Engrossing, engaging plot - the odds are against our hero, and you feel his plight, yet he finds ways to keep going. The resourcefulness stretches beyond a single man though, to the NASA, and other, people on the ground trying to get him home. This engenders a great feeling of a community of specialists working together.While I can't validate the science in the movie (I'll leave that to Neil deGrasse Tyson!), the science FEELS right - there are no obvious plot holes or inaccuracies. Good performances all round, especially from Matt Damon in the lead role. Only sour note is Sean Bean's character, which came across as cartoonish.A must-see."
"I believe this is one of the overrated films on IMDb. While it has a high user rating and for some reason totally mistakenly in the Top 250, user reviews are mostly bad. And they are right. This movie is boring, unrealistic and totally not entertaining. I mean, what makes a movie a good movie? We all know that a movie is not real. We still feel entertained, why? Because we can feel the main characters struggle in a difficult situation, we suffer with him, we have empathy. None of these are happening to the audience when you watch this one.It was actually the sappy behavior of the characters making you feel bored watching. I would have accepted the fact that he grew potatoes out of the feces of his buddies and they have left them there, okay why not ... he a botanist (how exciting by the way).Just a few examples: For reasons unknown, he starts taking Vicodin with his potato - I actually had to look it up what Vicodin was, and then did not understand the message of this.The captain of the ship blames himself immediately ""I left him there"" after they have received the message. Come on guys, give the character some time to emotionally apprehend the situation, before she starts blaming herself! Nobody does that immediately... not ever!Who is this stupid moron looking like a drug addict in his totally messy office, where no one should have taken seriously? A total loner-loser, who works for NASA, doesn't even know the directors name when he is in his office... and then performs an act of a 3-year- old? What is this, are you kidding me? Why should the audience take this seriously at all?Ridley Scott has totally failed to give the crew them some meaning. They could have just robots as far as I am concerned, wouldn't make this movie less worse.There is just no excitement the whole time. He was deserted. You know exactly that his own crew will go back to help him at about in the middle of the movie. You know the attempt with the first rocket will fail, because you have already understood, some heroism with the ""we won't let anybody behind""-message is actually the main story here. But you had to watch all that story of building that bogus rocket – I was bored to death! And then it explodes and fails, what a surprise!So after that, you beg for a plot where something miraculous will happen. Instead, something totally ordinary happens, again! He flies to the crew. An astronaut goes out, he flies out of his capsule. I was asking myself... this is it?For a moment I thought I was watching a Roland Emmerich, but I had sworn never to watch an Emmerich again. Ridley Scott now goes the same way. Predictable, immature dialogs, artificial heroism, non- innovative action."
"When I was a 10-year old kid my favourite TV programme was Gerry Anderson's U.F.O. and my favourite EVER episode of that was one called ""Survival"". In it, Colonel Paul Foster (the late Michael 'nearly Bond' Billington) was stranded believed dead on the moon a hundred miles from Moonbase with diminishing oxygen supplies and with the deadly threat of a similarly stranded alien to also deal with. To say it fired my youthful imagination would be an understatement. With Ridley Scott's new film ""The Martian"" we have an almost identical plot, albeit without the alien involvement.Matt Damon plays astronaut Mark Watney who after a freak Martian storm is left for dead by his colleagues in the NASA crew of the ""Hermes"" (led by the excellent Jessica Chastain). By ""sciencing the s**t out of this"" he struggles to survive in the airless and inhospitable landscape. By chance, his presence is detected by NASA and the action switches to the NASA team – principally NASA Director Jeff Daniels, Mars mission director Chiwetel Ejiofor, PR lady Kirsten Wiig, JPL specialist Benedict Wong and ""Hermes"" flight director Sean Bean – and their struggle to save him given the logistical impossibilities involved.I loved this film. In fact, I'll go as far as to say this is my film of the year so far. Matt Damon – never 'Mr Charisma' in most films – is spectacular here, delivering his video logs (which – particularly in 3D – works better than Tom Hanks talking to footballs in ""Castaway"") with a wit and charm that is quite endearing. The supporting cast all bring home the bacon with strong performances, with Ejiofor positively twinkling in the role. The rest of the ""Hermes"" crew, especially Michael Peña and the cute Kate Mara, are also excellent.The screenplay by Drew Goddard (""Lost"", ""World War Z"") and based on the bestselling book by Andy Weir generally works well. A few of the lines, my wife noted, smelled a bit of cheese (some of those from Sean Bean in particular), and there is a largely underdeveloped Chinese side-story (presumably to woo a Chinese audience), but overall the mood of the film carries the script triumphantly forward. (There's a nice nod and a wink to Bean's involvement in Lord of the Rings as well, which made me chuckle).The film also looks marvelous, with the Mars sets and special effects being spectacular, the Mars spacecraft being beautifully realized, and some very impressive long-duration zero-gravity scenes aboard the ""Hermes"" that boggle the mind.In retrospect, the film's success might be deemed to be assured given it is an amalgam of some notable film classics of recent times: the spectacle of ""Interstellar""; the intrigue of ""Moon""; the vacuum-based-perils of ""Gravity""; the hopelessness of ""Castaway"" and the 'world holds its breath' tension of ""Apollo 13"". But after the blockbuster food-mixer stops whirring, the whole thing gels beautifully and despite its fairly long running time (141 minutes) boredom is never close and you leave the theatre buzzing. A key factor in maintaining the tension for the running time is that this is a Ridley Scott film: whilst other directors might insist on a 'Hollywood' ending, with Scott at the helm you can never be sure which way the story might twist in the final reel.(And I'm not letting on here).Unlike last year's ""Gravity"", and the no-doubt accurate but mind-boggling ""Interstellar"", the science all holds up pretty well (although I did have serious reservations about the robustness of polythene sheeting and duct-tape replacing a door at one point).Harry Gregson-Willams' score apes Jerry Goldsmith's ""Alien"" a bit in places, but works well and is massively and joyfully supported by a wide range of disco classics, neatly incorporated into the plot.Go see this film, ideally at the cinema and in 3D: I doubt you will be disappointed. Heaven knows, I don't give away 10 stars very often, but in this case.(If you enjoyed this review please see the graphical version at bob-the-movie-man.com and sign up for future reviews by entering your email)."
"This film made me feel neutral. I found the using-science-to-solve-problems aspect interesting but that isn't what makes a film resonate with me. It's the characters. The characters in this film do not feel like people. They feel empty. Sure, Mark Watney, the lead played by Matt Damon, has a personality I guess. We learn early on that he is an easy-going guy who can remain calm in most stressful situations. However, there isn't much else to him. I had no reason to connect to him. No one bothered to give him any sort of arc or background. He doesn't change or grow as a person at all. I know not every protagonist has to go through some sort of change but this character could have with at least a little bit of internal conflict. This applies to the rest of the cast as well. Only four characters in the film stood out to me in anyway: Watney, Rich Purnell (Donald Glover), Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Michael Peña's character. Watney because he is, I suppose, more well rounded than the rest of the cast; Purnell because an archetypal quirky genius character is better than no character at all; Kapoor because his skills in communication and persuasion make him stand out which is a required quality for his job (Mars mission director, I had to look it up on Wikipedia); and Peña's character because of the two tiny moments of banter between him and Watney. Everyone else is defined by their jobs (which I've forgotten for the most part anyway) and what actions they need to do for their job. When it comes to technical aspects, nothing was really done badly but nothing was done exceptionally either. The direction served its purpose but didn't impress. The cast did a pretty good job in their roles but no one made up for their lacklustre* characters. The visual effects are good. Granted, nothing stood out but that wasn't the purpose. They're supposed to make the spectacle look convincing, and they accomplish that. Lastly, I would like to mention the score. Throughout most of the film, I didn't really pay attention to it but in the first few scenes when Watney is stranded on Mars, I felt that the music was too overdramatic. This probably isn't that much of a problem as I forgot about it quickly but it's distracting when the score is too intense or emotional for the scene it's accompanying.Overall, this film neither impressed nor annoyed me. It's competently well made but it feels empty. If either the premise or the problem solving aspect interests you, you might like it. Otherwise, you can skip it.*That's the British spelling of ""lackluster"" apparently.http://letterboxd.com/lloyd_morgan/film/the-martian/"
"Personally didn't like the movie very much. In my opinion there was way to much Humor for a Sci-fi drama. I felt like the main character ( Matt Damon) didn't capture someone actually stranded in a life or death situation. Compared to Interstellar this movie was a flop. Had no emotional attachment to any of the main characters. This movie was extremely "" Hollywoodized "" with an unreasonable amount of impossible ""WTF"" moments. I knew from the 1st couple minutes the entire script and how some characters would act ( predictable ). Id rather see a more realistic version without the humor. I'm no movie critic just a un- educated bottom feeder."
"I don't really understand all the hype behind this movie. Maybe it's because I've heard the book was so good that this movie created some buzz before its release. I normally enjoy sci fi movies and I am generally a fan of Ridley Scott. I enjoy being moved by great acting performances and being awed by the mysteriousness and the unknown this type of genre is able to project on the big screen. However, this movie did none of the above for me. Although Matt Damon is an excellent actor, it was difficult for me to fully buy into his character. Despite being alone and stranded on Mars, he lacked emotion and credibility. The other characters in this movie fell flat, too. The biggest disappointments were Kristen Wiig and Jeff Daniels – it was too one dimensional, lacked versatility, and was to cliché. Actually, the plot was very cliché and was very predictable. And the special effects and action sequences were far too similar to what we saw in Prometheus. I guess I expected more with this cast and director but was left wanting so much more."
"The movie started just like any other adventure movie. The trailer promised a really intriguing story line. This movie is based on a book and for me many things were made differently than the book. Matt Damon was usual a perfect choice for the role. He had to portray the struggle and willingness to survive alone in an absolutely no mans land. I liked the acting of everyone but the plot line was not very interesting. It was very common and obvious that the crew who left him will go and save him at some point and everything will be alright at the end. I watch the 1080p version (i think) and the VFX was magnificent and was true to the story. All in all, it was a good time pass movie, not at all boring and fun to watch"
"I really looked forward to this movie. High score both on IMDb and rotten, so all lights seem to be green....but the score has to be influenced by the studio as it goes almost every time with 'big' movies last few years. Mediocre or worse movies scoring like masterpieces :-(. Everything positive you read about this movie you can safely wipe from memory. Only two positive points: nice 'spaceshots' and a few moments of good acting from Damon. Too few to make the story believable or to really care about his character. It's what I would call a 100% Hollywood movie. Cliché-filled and therefor to forget asap...but then again that's just me.. you may like it."
"The decadence of Ridley Scott in my opinion. The one who offered us some great movies (""Allien"" is enough I believe to make the comparison and point out the importance of a good scenario and small budget to create a ""great"" movie). The whole movie hasn't created, to me at least, the feeling of agony and suspense that was meant to create and I cannot understand the dithyrambic critics (8.2 IMDb score?).More it was a movie like ""Indepedence Day"", where the ""good guys"" win nomatter what.....A great disappointment from Ridley Scott and a movie that did not offer anything new, from a director that has created collosal movies in the past (what to count first: Blade Runner, Allien, Gladiator..... 0."
"I saw this film on it's opening night, with a group of friends from work. The film's beginning drew me in, and Matt Damon's lighthearted humor was quite amusing.That being said, the formulaic plot, lack of character development outside of Matt Damon's character, and eventually tiring jokes wore me out by the end of the movie. It must've been a decent film, since I did find myself laughing now and then, and I also found myself rooting for Matt Damon. That said, it's a highly forgettable flick, and I don't understand why it's so beloved.Watch it if you have the chance, but don't expect an incredible film."
"To my big surprise I liked the Bourne movies with Matt Damon and this is why I went to see this ""Mars""movie with him. (I am not an action movie fan) Am I the only one who gets tired of seeing big stars raking in millions for a movie where they basically behave like they do on every talk show they visit to promote their movies. George Clooney comes to mind too. I have not read the book and after the movie I probably won't. But I understand that there was a lot of danger and suspension in the book, not so in the movie. Damon obviously is too big a star now to go through the trouble and actually loose weight for a role where he is supposed to nearly starve to death. Instead we get a naked, emaciated body of somebody else walking through the room and the well-fed Damon for the rest of the movie after eating minuscule portions for months. Decades ago I loved to see the NASA movies on Imax whenever I visited Houston or Cape Kennedy. None of the movies about space I have seen lately gave me the same sense of awe-inspiring greatness of our universe. I just sit there and ask myself if it is all filmed in a studio or in some desert , or is it all the work of computers? Nothing awe inspiring. Well, I should have learned my lesson by now, if a movie is really pushed by the studio I am always disappointed. Luckily I paid only four bucks to see it."
"OK, this is really a very very bad movie. And on several levels. Matt Damon plays awfully bad. Well this is no news, he is an awful actor, but stillHe is in this movie so emotionally numb. The scenario is really not suspenseful. Most of the scientific facts are just thrown at your head like if you were totally stupid and know nothing. All the scenario is totally unlikely. And I don't speak about the political correctness (black, Chinese everybody is there) that is really an insult to intelligence. Finally I can say that the film had beautiful images. This is the only thing I can say positive. That's all. Conclusion : this movie is a waste of time. I have already forgotten it. Man where are the SF films like Alien"
"People go to the cinema to be entertained, not to be schooled by people who have no idea what are they talking about. And on top of everything: why do you have to add politics and forced multiculturalism to every movie?! Is there a committee in Hollywood who demands that every single movie has to include multiculturalism, forced, not funny jokes, American flag, American nationalism, women who are good leaders?! It's like all the movies were written by the same people, all the effects done by the same crew, time to change Hollywood! Ridley Scott how could you? This movie is not entertaining, it's full of politics and preachy bull crap."
"I like sci-fi as a genre but I completely hate it when film makers assume a general level of dumbness in their audience and resultantly try to peddle whatever they think can sell. I am appalled both by the movie as well as the number of people here on IMDb who actually found the movie worthwhile. I am not even going into the scientific aspects of what Whatney did and whether or not the fiction was any close to truth. In general, I don't like to poke holes in sci-fi, simply because the second word is 'fiction'. What got me was just the childish and rather superficial treatment accorded to everything. Not once did you feel for Whatney or any of the other crew members. The dialogue is gcheesy, bordering on inane. Clichés abound - there is a half-hindu (a separate dialogue was introduced in the movie just to highlight this fact) good-natured scientist and helpful Chinese space agency to boot. Even the special effects are underwhelming. There are instances where you can quite clearly see and feel its a toy car on the red soil. I think Hollywood is running out of ideas, 2015 has generally been god-awful and Martian is just another on that list."
"This is certainly an entertaining film as a formula movie. It's fun like the earlier ""Independence Day"" film with Bill Pullman and Will Smith. We put a poor guy in an untenable situation, trapped on a planet when his colleagues are forced to take off and leave him behind. As a scientist, he does miraculous things to stay alive, including creating a greenhouse where he can grow potatoes (that just happen to be on board providing seed). That's OK. That's a plot element. He also has incredible knowledge of all the incredible stuff left behind on Mars. An amazing rover as well as a nuclear device. That's OK too because we can't have a plot without something for this guy to do. Where it falls down is in the reality of NASA (which we are told are a pack of insensitive boobs or nerds). They are going to do this and then they are going to do that. Jeff Daniels plays a stuck-in-the-mud guy who is only concerned about the politics of the job. I love Matt Damon. I've seen nearly everything he has done. He's adequate in this film but certainly not Academy Award material. He expresses almost no emotions other than a couple little under-control tantrums. What about the loneliness, the sameness of every day? Years of eating potatoes. Anyway, it is candy for those who don't want to think very much. It's very impresstive looking and the special effects are awesome. We've become a bit spoiled, I guess. Things by the formula."
"The story about Mark Watney, an astronaut in the future that is left on Mars, when his crew mistakingly leave him behind. I had expected huge things from this movie, it started very well, but then it came quite boring, there is only so much solo time one man can do on the film. The other characters were not too interesting, except for Vincent and Bruce, the only two likable. Matt Damon is a very good actor, much better news that he is doing another Jason Bourne film. The Martian is watchable but what is the problem is the ending, it was really badly done, the film was credible up to then. Best thing about the movie were the special effects, the film looks good."
"to name a few: Robinson Crusoe, Mission To Mars (2000), Robinson Crusoe on Mars (1964) whereas Andy Weir's novel is a blatant theft of those ideas as well as it is the script of The Martian, . . . etc.To give the very unoriginal story some gravity, the prominent cast obviously was the means of choice. This movie was solely developed as a typical Hollywood cash cow with pretty faces and implausibly characters. Scott's attempt of pseudo-realistic 'science' suffers from the same symptoms as it did Prometheus: stupidity on all levels.Scott said, The Martian is about people of all kind combining their sources and powers. Well, this is quite pathetic for a bunch of very unoriginal ideas glued together. Maybe Scott recently watched some Star Trek episodes or Apollo 13 (1995) to get 'some' inspirations . . .I guess it's time to avoid Ridley Scott movies from now on."
"Sir Ridley Scott is finally back on track. There's no argument that his last couple films have not been up to his standard. However, now he has gone back to his roots to bring us an adaptation of the sci-fi novel by Andy Weir The Martian.The story itself is pretty straightforward. Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is presumed dead when stuck with debris during a storm on Mars. When the rest of his crew decides to abort and he turns out to be alive, Watney must ration his remaining resources in an attempt to same himself and make contact with NASA. Despite the familiar storyline (can you say Cast Away meets Apollo 13?), only a true mastermind behind the camera can give the story so much depth and make it so enthralling. The cast is definitely one of the best ensembles of the year. Everyone does fantastic with the roles given to them, namely Chiwetel Ejiofor and Jeff Daniels. And while everyone does a great job in the movie, the man whose shoulders the film truly rests on is Matt Damon, and he excels in every scene he is in. The audience is always eager to follow Damon's successes and failures on Mars. Damon is so good at playing a wise- cracking scientist and showing us what it might actually be like to get left on Mars alone. With Damon's character, the movie is allowed to delve into themes about what makes us human and our drive to help one another.One of the aspects of the film that truly fascinated me was how much science was explained out in the movie. The science is always intriguing and never makes one feel as though they are in school needing to remember everything they heard. The Martian is easily one of the best films of the year and a very welcome return to form for Sir Ridley Scott. The entire cast excels at bringing the audience a fascinating trip not only of the inner-workings of NASA, but of a man's journey of survival as he is left on Mars.""I admit it's fatally dangerous, but I'd get to fly around like Iron Man"""
"Fantastic film about determination, perseverance, optimism, faith, leadership, collaboration and initiative. It reminded me a bit of the atmosphere in the movie Apollo 13. But with more action en with more interesting personages. Matt Damon is at his best: about 40% of the movie he is acting alone. In the movie NASA is as cool as one would expect and there are nice references to the real world. Good, if not great acting of experienced top-actors and excellent directing and editing. It's a long movie, which manages to keep you on full alert the whole 2.5 hours.The 3D effects are nicely done: the scenes look razor-sharp and realistic: the Martian scenes make one really believe that you're on Mars, the space equipment is also very believable and the camera work is very good.The only thing I found missing was that there was no story at all about the family of the astronaut."
it's so pathetic and slow....they play that trumpet violin triumph music whenever the astronauts twitch a muscle and everybody starts clapping and cheering like they figured out how to turn sh*t into gold the ending is awful too really cliché they just sensationalize the whole thing you know what i mean? they also failed miserably while trying to incorporate humor into the movie because the jokes were so bad i wanted to cry i don't think i even smirked throughout and it has an 8.3 on IMDb its disgraceful please do not watch under any circumstance unless you're fed up of life and want throw away a couple of hours you have been warned please also warn your friends family and other loved ones p*ss poor excuse for a movie
"Okay, I am also perplexed as to why people have given this terrible movie a favorable review. It seems like all we care about is a big name director and big star, then the movie has instant credibility. There was not one truly memorable moment in this movie. I cannot remember a single word, phrase, exchange of dialogue, or turn of event that left a lasting impression. The only positives were Matt Damon's likability and some decent special effects.For one thing how can this premise be taken ass even remotely plausible? Does anyone think that we would send ship to Mars that is vulnerable to a naturally and regularly occurring storm on Mars? And who would design a ship that is docked so perilously? It was standing up like one of those red/white/blue popsicle rocket treats we used to get from the ice cream man as a kid. Or even more than that it looked like a ship from a 1950's era sci-fi movie. C'mon man, this is a new millennium. Make a ship that is supported as it would be supported on Mars. It should be shorter and more stable, not doomed to tip over like shown in the movie. That one scene lost me for the next 30 minutes.Here are the other things I feel left me wanting with that movie. 1. When the storm struck I didn't know who was left behind. I knew it was the Matt Damon character but I didn't ""know"" him, meaning I had no emotional investment in that character. 2. He was a botanist, how convenient. His character didn't have to transform or change in any way in order to survive; he was the perfect guy to be left behind. 3. And just why were the potatoes going to run out??? They said you have 400 and something days, but never said why. Was it because there were other vital nutrients that would be lacking at that point? 4. If you give me 2 years to figure out how to solve a problem that means my survival, and there's nothing else to do but figure it out, I bet I'l find something too. The dates before his food was going to run out were so far out that I never felt a sense of urgency. You can call Mars ""The Monster"" but it wasn't pursuing the main character, just waiting for him to run out of food. How boring is that??? 5. When was the last time we saw nobody but good guys in a movie? There was nobody to blame, no bad guys anywhere. That was just plain weak. A bad guys doesn't have to be a bad person, just a person who either has too much fear or fears the wrong thing, which causes him/her to make poor choices. Nobody served as a villain in any way. I know from playing sports and working in small and large companies that there's always a person who feels like the bad guy, even unintentionally. This movie, with it's little slice of heaven, was absurd to say the least.For these reasons and other minor reasons I was totally disappointed. My wife liked it and I couldn't understand why. This was the dumbest movie I've seen in a long time. I really wanted to like ti but was terribly disappointed."
"Really IMDb? An 8.2 rating, for this piece of crap? Reviewer DavidC-29 put it best when he wrote; ""This movie can be summed up with one word... vapid. As if Matt Damon's inherently vapid acting weren't bad enough, the makers of this film were so overtly focused on presenting an idyllic reality where no character behaves in any offensive way, to anybody, they produced an un-suspenseful, uninteresting, boring, vapid turd of a story. They fall over themselves to be so certain that no minority demographic is stereotyped that all characters have the sane vapid personality. And in what seems to be some sort of perverse effort to recompense reality, a very transparent hierarchy is followed to be certain that: the Black people are the most clever; the Hispanic people are next most clever; the Asian people are next most clever(carefully not portrayed as exceptionally smart), and of course the women are more clever than the men. Of course the only flawed demographic were older white male authority figures. To me this liberal, philosophical portrayal of what an ideal reality is reveals that they are the true bigots, the haters. They hate the differences that make people interesting. Ethnicity, femininity / masculinity, and their different traits should be loved and celebrated, not shamed, muted, or eliminated. It is the interaction of those differences that create an interesting story, not a vapid one.""When you go to a movie or turn on your TV, you think you're being entertained, but in reality you are being PROGRAMMED! Why do you think they call it ""television programming""... I would also like to point out one other angle of the propaganda in this movie... Like when the communist Chinese offer the assistance of their top-secret rocket in an effort to save one lone American. Also the way they made the crew be from multiple countries... I know NASA really does work with astronauts from other nations, but I also know that this is one reason why Hollywood loves these space movies, because it's a great vehicle for pushing globalist propaganda. Independence Day 2 is sure to take the globalist propaganda to the next level, as a planet united under the leadership of the UN (which is sick and laughable) must fight for their survival against aliens (which don't really exist)... The not so funny thing, is that the REAL greatest threat to humanity as we know it, ARE THOSE THAT PUSH THE GLOBALIST AGENDA! Check the ""GEORGIA GUIDESTONES"" for proof of that... Billionaires like Bill Gates and Ted Turner are working day and night, doing all they can to ensure that your family tree will stop bearing fruit as soon as possible. Ted Turner says lower global population by 85%, yet he has 5 children and 14 grandchildren... Why not sterilize your children and grandchildren TED? ""Save the planet"" TED! Or how about the big ""climate conference"" last month in Paris...?... Supposedly the planet is about to boil over (LIE) because people drive too much, or fly too much, or eat too much meat, so it was critical that all the world leaders meet in Paris to discuss a solution... Unfortunately the politicians, billionaires, and all their massive entourages were all forced to fly on lavish private jets, be driven to and from in massive convoys of armour-plated SUVs, and they were made to gorge themselves on 5-star cuisine... Why cant we come up with a way where we could have meetings like this, without having to ""destroy our planet by burning these evil fossil fuels""? If only the technology existed which allowed numerous people in different locations to all have a conversation with each other at the same time... I mean I'm sure if such a technology did exist, ""our leaders"" would surely utilize such a technology, because NOBODY TAKES THE THREAT OF ""CLIMATE CHANGE"" MORE SERIOUS THAN THEM! Lol........Wake up people... Every person on the planet could fit into a landmass the size of Texas, and we'd still all have enough room for everybody to have both a front and back yard... They are sterilizing us generationally as we speak... They have contaminated our food and water supply with GMO's... They know that all animals fed the GMO corn were sterile by the 3rd or 4th generation of animals who ate the corn... Many other rabbits/gerbils/rats/etc that were fed the GMO food developed large tumors and died from said tumors... You think Bill Gates and Ted Turner eat the GMO food? Hell no! That's for us, the peasants/slaves..."
"I was somewhat disappointed by 'The Martian', maybe because I had such high expectations of it. In my opinion the movie failed to really immerse you into the action or make you feel the danger of space, the way that for example 'Gravity' did.Also, it came across as feel-good NASA propaganda. Maybe that one is on me for being so cynical, I am not sure. The attempts at humor never made me laugh and sometimes made me feel embarrassed.I am not saying that it is a bad movie. I liked its realistic and scientific approach. There should be more sci-fi movies done in such an earnest way. However, in my experience 'The Martian' does not succeed in truly captivating or intriguing you."
"The once great Ridley Scott continues to disappoint in a film for Matt Damon enthusiasts who enjoy crowd-pleasing silly dialogue & gooey, touching moments with accompanying music that helps you know when you're supposed to feel something. Bring him home? Eh...seems like a lot of work & I'm sure in reality NASA wouldn't bother. And neither should you."
"During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meagre supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive.Andy Weir started writing a book about an astronaut stranded on Mars. He hadn't had any success with publishers in the past, so he begun posting chapters to his website. That was 2011. People really liked it - so much that Crown Publishing made it become a best-seller. Weir tells this story through largely detailed work logs. The Martian is impressively geeky. Smart science-fiction is such a rarity these days. Our parents witnessed the first man in the Moon decades ago and we witnessed the landing of curiosity on Mars: WE are the Mars generation. That's the inspiration. Astronauts really are the real pioneers. They do something incredibly heroic, brave and risky but also incredibly necessary. This book is adapted by Ridley Scott, who transformed science-fiction cinema with Blade Runner and Alien. Once again, Scott goes back to the future, which is a familiar destination for him. Andy Weir and screenplay writers wrote us a love letter to science. They obviously skipped a lot of complications in the film, there's so much in the book but they decide to pick out some bits and leave others which is natural and not a problem at all. You definitely don't need to have read the book to enjoy the movie but you definitely SHOULD read the book because it's fantastic! Mr Weir, from online serial to book to screen, has brought a little appreciated genre into the mainstream: the nerd thriller. This hyper-technical genre, deeply developed by novelists does something that classic thrillers do not: it puts the nerd (female or male) in the centre of the action. The intellectual is the hero. Imagine that instead of Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg was the star of Mission: Impossible. This is an adventure for those of us who believe, deep in our hearts, that the heroes of Star Trek are Spock and Scotty: the science officer and the engineer. And writing about The Martian seems to be bringing out the geekiness even more in your humble correspondent. Still its heart, humour and rousing story of perseverance and global collaboration promise to broaden the film's appeal well beyond nerds. A lot of people - including myself - responded to the characters in the book. The humour and the way he keeps his logical, practical spirit in order to solve one problem at a time; is what makes this character compelling and super duper interesting. Andy Weir admits freely that his character has little inner life. Watney simply pushes forward, putting crises into a mental lock box and figuring out how to survive. ""It could have been a deep psychological thing"", he said ""but that's not the kind of book I like to read and it's not the kind of book I wanted to write"". Engineer at NASA - who are hoping to get people to Mars someday - said Mr Weir has captured something important about what make Humans want to explore. Mark Watney character represents the very cutting edge of humanity and what's possible and what we know we all need someday; which is move some of the species off the planet to ensure the species survival. Nowadays still, there are people working toward that goal. ""Watney's everybody's favourite"" because he's the brave, resourceful American optimist. We all know a smart ass nerd just like him. Moreover, if you're going to be stuck alone with an actor, who guides you through a story with nothing but video diaries, you need someone who can exude the right amount of humour and confidence. In significant measure due to his character's mordant humour, Matt Damon provides a very good company during the long stretches when he's on screen alone. Plus the actor's physicality makes Mark's capability entirely credible. Matt Damon has the charm and wit to land the tricky one-liners. You try making ""Fuck you, Mars!"" sound cool. From there Watney must not only come to grips with the most dire situation any astronaut has ever faced, but also mends his own gory abdominal wound in a scene that is Prometheus-level in its guts wrenching body horror. Watney is supposedly a symbol of hope for all humanity in the final act. Creating at the same time a new Manifest Destiny. This movie is the Die Hard of space film. Matt Damon gets stab, he gets frozen, he gets exploded and even burnt. Scenes back on Earth provide a hectic, densely populated counterweight to the Martian aridity. The rest of the cast is diverse in a way that feels genuinely authentic. In the story the rest of us on Earth have this understanding of what this man sacrificed and the beauty of that. They do everything they can to bring him back because he represents the best of us all. However (...) > Head over to my blog to read more about The Martian"
"Ridley Scott's new film ""The Martian"" does not mess around with buildup or anything in the way of expository drama; it gets right to the point and recognizes why you came to see it. It opens with Ares III, NASA's manned mission to Mars, experiencing a treacherous storm upon arriving on the red planet. Debris is flying and visibility is next to nothing, and before the astronauts (Jessica Chastain, Michael Peña, and Kate Mara) can take off, fellow astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is struck by a flying antenna and presumed killed. The group takes off with the notion that Watney is dead.Following NASA head Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) making the announcement of Watney's death, we see that Watney is indeed very much alive on Mars, albeit slightly handicapped after being impaled in the stomach by the antenna. Watney now has to essentially operate on a field of landmines whilst acting as a scientist MacGyver to try and sustain life on Mars, a place where presumably nothing grows and anything can go wrong at any time. In addition to monitoring water reclamation, oxygen, and atmospheric levels, he winds up growing an array of potatoes with the help of the feces of him and his crew and makes a small home for himself. It will over four years for another manned mission to rescue him, but NASA headquarters, comprised of Sanders and assistants like Vincent (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Annie (Kristen Wiig), is determined to bring him back home in a timely fashion.Headquarters is also struggling with the idea of telling the surviving members of the Ares III mission that Watney is alive, which ignites a fiery ethical side to the film's story. With that, ""The Martian"" is essentially a gigantic teamwork exercise where everyone feels human, which is a pleasant attribute for Scott, whose recent films have really lacked in the filmmaking craft and humanization elements. Scott's visual effects and grandscale directing usually never fail, but when these become the focus and human characters and the little touches (the science, the cause-and-effect relationships, and the narrative interest) become secondary or gravely shortchanged, then there's a real issue with his films on a macro level.""The Martian,"" even with its nearly two and a half hour runtime, remains consistently interesting because it's a generally optimistic film, surprisingly enough. Watney is a wisecracker a lot of the time, even in the face of certain doom, and seeing NASA's constant efforts to bring him home show a certain diligence on their behalf works to make this film surprisingly hopeful. Then there's the roundtable of rich performances here; aside from Damon, who does solid work being the only actor on-screen in his scenes for his sheer honesty mixed with vulnerability, Daniels and Ejiofor work off of each other incredibly well together here.Consider the scene following Ares III's escape from Mars during the storm, when Watney is still presumed dead; the two consult one another about what to do with Watney's remains whilst subsequently trying to find a way to turn it into a more positive, caring PR display by sending another mission out to recover his corpse. This is a perfect scene in the way that it shows the way corporations and organizations balance humanity while considering their bottom-line, and who better to play figures in those pivotal positions of power than Daniels, who's work on ""The Newsroom"" has gone on to be acclaimed, and Ejiofor, who, much like David Oyelowo, will likely win an Oscar in the next ten years.Aside from a reliance on montages instead of actual exposition, ""The Martian""'s biggest problem as a film is the fact that we simply do not get enough time with Watney alone. The audience can never get a strong grasp on a relationship with this character simply because we're never allotted enough one-on-one time without the intrusion of mission control. We needed more scenes with Watney ostensibly helpless, trying to farm, or simply trying to get by on what little he has to surround himself and the film doesn't do that.""The Martian"" also makes fairly strong use of its 3D elements, using it as a tool of immersion rather than a gimmick that works to add a surcharge to already high movie ticket prices. Consider the storm scene, which completely floods the screen with indiscernible debris and disarray; the scene is only emphasized with the benefit of 3D and makes the experience that much more horrifying, being that, like the characters, we can barely see a thing.Above all, this is a film destined to please a crowd; in addition, it also keeps its pathos down considerably, doesn't do a whole lot of pandering to a crowd anxious to see action, and never loses sight of its deeply human and remarkable story. It also reaffirms the value of logical problem-solving in the face of a truly unexpected, and granted unprecedented, time of tumultuous uncertainty. It's a low-key triumph made on a nine figure budget."
"This movie was made by the director of Blade Runner and Alien, two works of art, but that was many years ago, back when Mr Scott still had some creativity left. After making this movie Ridley Scott should go into a nursing home and hide. What a piece of crap!! Matt Damon growing potatoes on Mars? Acting? There is no acting! Stay home and watch Blade Runner one more time..:) And the music... Disco all the way!! With David Bowie - Life On Mars? That's when you should close your eyes and get lost in the music, but unfortunately they don't play the entire song! Then there is ABBA, and we all like ABBA... :) NASA is desperately trying to survive and needs a new ""project"" and Mars is it. They always ""forget"" to mention to the general public that the atmosphere of Mars is about 100 times thinner than Earth's, and it is 95 percent carbon dioxide. Is much colder also. The average temperature is about minus 80F. So, if there is water on that planet I would not drink it...:) Going back to the real world...If you like sci-fi I recommend Ex Machina or Luci, if you want to have some fun."
"For all the excitement, awe, and energy that are worked up in Ridley Scott's The Martian, the story might just as well have taken place in New York's Central Park with the hero stuck up in a tree. Instead of the sense of mystery and wonder (and terror) that could be expected from being stranded on a different world, what we have are buckets full of the down-to-earth (or up-to-Mars), nitty-gritty practicalities of science and a predictable plot that leaves no room for character development or introspection. In the story, written by Drew Goddard and based on the 2011 novel by Andy Weir, science is the redeemed and the redeemer, the hero and the heroine, the beginning and the end.Shot in 3-D, the film's fictional aspect is established almost immediately when we find out that NASA is actually engaged in space exploration rather than tallying up its budget deficit. Though we are not told the purpose of the Ares III manned mission to Mars, we know soon enough that the crew is forced to abandon their plans when they discover that a huge life-threatening sandstorm is fast approaching. Like Home Alone, the crew takes off for home but - wait a minute - they forgot Kevin. In this case, Kevin is fellow crew member Mark Watney, played with excruciating blandness by Matt Damon. Watney, presumed to be dead after the storm strikes, turns the tables on the departed crew and decides to stay alive, though according to his best judgment, his reprieve will only be temporary.Watney must use his ingenuity and skills as a Botanist to solve his food problems to stay alive, but that is not his only concern. He has no way to communicate with Earth, knows that the next planned Mars mission will not be for four years, and that the landing spot on Mars is 3,200 kilometers away. As Watney explains in his video diaries, to survive he is going to have to ""science the s..t out of this."" He first makes changes to the Rover, his only vehicle, to allow for longer trips and then sets about growing potatoes in an artificial environment. Whether he likes potatoes or not, they are now his only source of nourishment and means of survival. The subject of embarrassingly phony eulogies back on Earth, NASA is shocked when satellite photos of Mars reveal that Watney has defied the odds and is still alive.The crew returning home on the Hermes spacecraft are not informed, however, to avoid distracting them from their flight - a decision made by NASA director Terry Sanders, played by a miscast Jeff Daniels. When Sanders, marketing chief Annie (Kristen Wiig) and NASA mission director Vincent (Chiwetel Ejiofor) find out that Mark is alive, they must find a way to ""Bring Him Home"" or else the film's promotional department will get very upset. Eventually, Watney finds a way to talk to NASA by using communications devices from the Pathfinder probe, dormant since 1997, but the film provides little insight into Watney's character and he seems to be emotionally unaffected by his plight, telling lame jokes as if he was planting potatoes in his back yard.The more interesting story takes place at Houston's Johnson Space Center where plans are underway to send a probe to Mars to resupply Watney so he can last another several years on the planet, then return to the spacecraft carrying colleagues Mitch Henderson (Sean Bean), Rick Martinez (Michael Peña), Beth Johanssen (Kate Mara), Chris Beck (Sebastian Stan) and Alex Vogel (Aksel Hennie). After the launch ends up in disaster, help arrives via the Chinese space program and the Ares III crew itself must now make a crucial decision that has life or death consequences. The Martian has some fine technical achievements including breathtaking vistas of the Martian landscape by cinematographer Dariusz Wolsky and it is an entertaining film, yet all its achievements are subsumed in an atmosphere as exciting as a how-to-manual.Disco music left behind by Commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) such as songs by David Bowie and Gloria Gaynor, attempt to enhance the film's entertainment quotient and appeal to younger viewers but they only serve to distract viewers from whatever reality the story has. To its credit, The Martian has a humane message empowered by the enormity of the cooperation required to attempt to save the life of one man and it reminds us of the days when we all had a common purpose, yet the film lacks conviction and never moves past banal dialogue such as ""YES"", ""let's do it,"" and all the standard clichés of triumphalism. While Damon may have scienced the s..t out of his predicament, the film has also succeeded in sciencing the beauty out of it."
"During a storm in Mars, the astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is hit by an antenna and presumed dead by his captain and crew that cannot find him. Captain Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) seeks him out and decides to departure with her crew. However, he has survived and finds that was left behind short of supplies and without communication to Earth. Mark is botanic and uses his knowledge to plant potatoes in a green house he has prepared. Meanwhile in NASA the scientists find that Mark is alive and try at any cost to bring him back to Earth. Will they succeed?""The Martian"" is a film with fantastic special effects and cinematography. However there is a total lack of emotions and suspense and it is hard to understand the hype around this film. Mark Watney seems to be a combination of Robinson Crusoe with MacGyver with his ideas and solutions. However, he never feels depressed or in despair with the loneliness or with his doomed situation. His rescue is a rip-off ""Gravity"" that is better and better. If the viewer watches this movie with great expectation, he or she will be very disappointed. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Perdido em Marte"" (""Lost in Mars"")"

But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive.The Martian was a major disappointment for me. Mars looks fantastic and everything looks great, but I wasn't able to ever fully get into it like I wanted to. It never felt like Matt Damon was in any true danger to me despite how it was presented otherwise. It tries way too hard to be epic and that's one of the reason it fails. I also felt it lacked suspense. One thing Gravity did well was deliver suspense, but The Martian doesn't. This surprised me a lot because Ridley Scott is a master at suspense. Even though I didn't really go nuts over this movie like a lot of people did, Matt Damon is fantastic. He holds the film together with his excellent performance. I can't really say the same for the rest. Everybody else isn't developed that well. Jessica Chastain is a very capable actress, but she isn't given much to do as I'd hoped. Wiig, Daniels, Bean, Mara, Ejiofor all do fine in the roles they are given. Ejiofor and Mara shine the most out of the people I listedThis movie has its moments, but I was very disappointed overall. It looks great, Damon is superb, but I wasn't in love with it like so many others. Hopefully I'm not alone 6/10"
