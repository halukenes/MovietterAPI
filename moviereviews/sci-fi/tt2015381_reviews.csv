I remember like it was yesterday when watching guardians of the galaxy I was 9 years old when the movie came out I was honestly really excited for the movie even though I was not familiar with the superhero's and I do have to admit I think guardians is better than avengers there's something about guardians I like better than the avengers is how the guardians met each other now let's get into movie first of all the movie has a fantastic soundtrack like with opening of Star lord dancing and how guardians met each other and when I heard they were making a movie like the avengers I was hyped my favorite character out the characters had to be rocket raccoon because he is funny for example when gamora cut one of groot's arm groot was sad and then rocket said it grow back you stupid idiot quit whining the cgi is wonderful and the special effects are amazing eventually the characters get into prison and the characters are trying to get out this when the movie gets interesting when the team are discussing a plan to get out the prison but then groot remove the battery and then they fight the security for the prison Also forget to mention Ronan in the movie but he is a excellent villian like when Star lord is fighting him in the final scene of the movie and the saddest part of the movie is that griot sacrificed himself for the team which is a pretty sad death it happens at the end of the movie honestly guardians of the galaxy is also one of my favorite 5 mcu movies and my favorite movie of 2014 so if you love the avengers you going to love the guardians of the galaxy it's a great movie trust me.
"Guardians of the Galaxy is nothing short of an amazing movie. If there's anything I can say, it's that it is the best superhero movie I have seen. Not only does it have the impressive set pieces and enough action to last you a lifetime, it has an emotional core and you actually get to care about each and every single character. Overall this movie is filled with all the required thrills and spills and is a first class action movie. It also has a great mixture of comedic value and a deal of seriousness. The film's unlikely hero is Quill (Chris Pratt), an eccentric gunfighter in the Han Solo mould who we meet stealing a metal orb coveted by the evil warlord Ronan. When he dispatches his top assassin, the green- skinned Gamora (Zoe Saldana), to recover the artifact, the pair find themselves locked up, along with the galaxy's most unlikely bounty hunters – a gun-toting raccoon (Bradley Cooper) and his sidekick (Vin Diesel) who just happens to be a walking tree. All the actors do a great job at portraying there characters, they feel real beings. You get to know about them and their struggles and you become attached to them. Every character in the movie got their time to shine, especially Rocket Raccoon who is voiced perfectly by Bradley Cooper. Everyone is pitch perfect in their roles even Batista! For those that want specifics: effects were top notch, acting was excellent, story lines were compelling, the comedy was perfect 99.5% of the time and surprise there were a lot of one line typical superhero zingers that worked really well. What really can't be stressed enough is just how insanely fun and entertaining Guardians of the Galaxy is for literally its entire two-hour-plus run-time. I still have a hard time wrestling with who was my favorite actor in this. all in all, the film is brilliantly well done, action scenes are engrossing and genuinely done, you genuinely worry about certain characters and I for one was thrilled with it. Go see this."
"I remember sitting in Hall H at Comic-Con two years ago, when Marvel first announced Guardians of the Galaxy. This came on the heels of the title reveals for Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Thor: The Dark World, and my initial reaction was one of utter confusion. What the hell was Guardians of the Galaxy? I was completely unfamiliar with the source material, and upon learning that the team featured a gun-wielding raccoon and a fighting tree creature whose could only speak a single phrase, I was even more puzzled.Fast forward to Comic-Con 2013, when James Gunn appeared onstage in Hall H to showcase the first trailer for the film. It was so unlike anything Marvel had ever done before, so far outside the box that I immediately fell in love with it and couldn't wait to see more. Although that first trailer was well-received by the Comic-Con audience, the general public seemed to be scratching their heads in much the same way that I had when the film was first announced. Marvel fans would love this, no doubt, but could this bizarre little sci-fi romp with a cast of unknown characters actually work?The answer is a resounding ""yes,"" as Guardians of the Galaxy is not only an exceptionally well-made comic-book film, but an exceptionally well- made film, period. It's a sprawling space opera with a host of memorable characters, a joyous sci-fi romp through beautifully realized worlds, wildly inventive action sequences, and an almost nonstop barrage of humor and fun. The protagonists are a bizarre assembly of losers and misfits, with the CG-created Rocket and Groot providing some of the most emotional and human moments of the film, and it's all brilliant. Marvel should be applauded for allowing Gunn the opportunity to realize his vision, because rest assured, this film wouldn't have been nearly as good with someone else at the helm.Guardians of the Galaxy has a distinct personality that sets it apart from other Marvel offerings, yet there are enough recognizable elements to remind audiences that it exists in the same world. Clocking in at just under two hours, the film maintains an impressively well-balanced pace, avoiding the problem of over-inflation that many superhero films fall victim to. I can't think of a single moment when I wasn't completely enthralled with everything that happens on screen, and as soon as the credits began to roll I was ready to watch it all over again."
"Expectations: surpassed - and they were pretty damn high to begin with.Excitement: met - after watching the teasers, the clips, and after Captain America the Winter soldier I was crossing my fingers Marvel were on a roll.Face: still trying to recover - you know when you go to the cinema to see a comedy ( a film designed to make you laugh ) and you feel like an idiot for paying for the ticket as you were forcing most of the laughter in the company of your friends? This is a film that it's genuinely easy to laugh about: The humour is so subtle because the characters are so subtle - they're not too animated, they're not too stereotypical and they are NOT what we've come to expect from traditional superheroes and THAT'S WHY THIS FILM WORKS SO WELL! Regardless if you're a Marvel fan or simply a fan of movies in general this is an experience you will welcome as it's new and refreshing to a sci-fi genre which really needed something new and refreshing and with great performances, stunning visuals and a barrel of laughs mixed with the right amount of action this was a real treat to watch.Thank you Marvel Studios."
"I entitle my review A New Hope as I walk out of the cinema feeling like I have just watched the Star Wars of our generation!As a huge Marvel fan (both comics and film) I was delighted to hear this film was getting made with the perfect choice of Guardians and what a perfect cast to play them. The biggest surprise for me was Dave Bautista who I thought was only cast for his size but his delivery was spot on for Drax. Chris Pratt was hilarious whilst still excellent at delivering some of the films most emotional scenes.CGI in this film was super, there's nothing I hate more than too much CGI in a film but it was so good in Guardians that I was completely lost in it. Never have a seen space look so good, the battles were incredible and Groot and Rocket never looked out of place (aside from being a tree and raccoon).Gunn is the perfect director for this, his tone, his balance of comedy, action and emotion blended perfectly and directing GOTG would have been no easy job. DC are still trying hard to get Justice League going, Marvel just made a film with a talking tree and Raccoon and it was AWESOME!!!Not a bad performance all round and comic fans will be happy with certain nods and winks scattered throughout. Probably my top Marvel film yet, it has the fresh new feeling the first Iron Man had with all the action and humour of The Avengers. 10 stars from me, even if your not a comic book or sci-fi fan, this movie has something for everyone."
"Great expectations before the film, definitely, and they really paid off. Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the best Marvel films to date, and a really good sci-fi at that too. The film is strong on so many levels, outstanding characters, great worlds, is emotional and humorous.Peter Quill, or Star Lord as he likes to call himself, is a quick-witted man of Earth thrown into the far reaches of galaxy, who has stolen an artifact that everyone seems to want. By accident he stumbles upon four other characters, Gamora the assassin, Drax the Destroyer, Rocket the enhanced raccoon and Groot the humanoid tree, and the five of them form an unlikely team. The characters are really well presented, their emotional core is strong and back stories engaging. In short, they're interesting and easy to like. All of them have great moments and keep us wanting for more and more. Rocket, in particular, steals the show with his anger management problems and bright one-liners. It was great to see a group of people each with their own agenda come together, this dynamic worked really well. Star-Lord carried a lot of this weight, and was very sympathetic.The film doesn't take itself very seriously, which was refreshing to see after also great yet darker themes of Thor and Captain America 2's. Guardians has a lot of laughs, witty dialogue, characters rub off on each other (and the audience), writing is perfect. The film is so entertaining, non-stop adventure but also knows when to balance with more dramatic themes. Scenery and worlds are spectacular, visual effects top notch. As a reader of the Guardians comics it was great to see some smaller motifs thrown in that may not be necessarily caught by regular viewers, but which the comic book readers will definitely be thankful for too.All in all, Guardians of the Galaxy was an awesome watch. Amazing characters, vivid cinematography, great dialogue, lots of humor, soundtrack was nice, story exciting. This wonderful adventure and its captivating characters will be in mind for a long time."
"It's no surprise that when Marvel's latest movie was released many, many people (the non comics reading kind, mainly) said ""Who?"" The comic itself has never been what you call top tier, with various incarnations having been around for decades, although the film is based on the team created by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning in 2008, now being serviced by top writer Brian Bendis.Marvel certainly have made sure the Guardians have plenty of publicity, turning a bunch of also rans into a must see event and even having the confidence to proclaim ""The Guardians Of The Galaxy Will Return"" at the end of the movie. This is a company with the utmost confidence in their product, and after seeing it it's very easy to understand why.First and foremost, Guardians... is fun. After a truly heartbreaking beginning everything goes a bit daft, mixing swashbuckling sci fi action with larger than life characters, and whilst at first you may be a little puzzled, it all streamlines into a simple plot soon enough. Basically, Guardians leader Peter Quill (known mainly to only himself as Star Lord) has a plot device, and other people also want the plot device. He forms an alliance with a very disparate bunch of people who each have their own reason for helping him. To go into more detail really isn't that necessary, as all it will involve is laying out a roster of names and personal grievances, and you'll get all that when you watch the film, because if you're reading this review I will lay odds you're going to see it.The movie looks beautiful throughout, probably thanks to the thousand or so ""Digital Artists"" who take up a large part of the end credits. Ship design is fantastic, with many looking like they were pulled direct from a Chris Foss art book, and if you know Foss you'll know this is a high compliment. Yeah, the bad guys have dull, dark vessels with inadequate lighting (surely evil needs to see as well?) but the good guys have some sexy vessels indeed. Sound wise, it may seem odd that a 2014 state of the art sci fi movie will have a 1970's chart soundtrack, but the inclusion of The Runaways, Rupert Holmes and, of course, Blue Swede's ""Hooked On A Feeling"" is completely explained and rather poignant. It would be nice, too, if kids start downloading some of this awesome old stuff and finally start listening to real music (so speaks an old fart).So in a nutshell this is a very good movie. It's packed with fun and enjoyable characters, but also has it's fair share of down beats and dead beats. Top honours are fought out for between Chris Pratt, excellent and ridiculously likable as Peter Quill, and the brilliant Rocket Raccoon, a purely CGI character stuffed with attitude and some great one liners. The other main characters all do well, however, with even big bag Ronan (no, not the Boyzone one, mores the pity) being well served and very well played with menace aforethought by Lee Pace.One thing people want to know about Marvel films is what's the after credits scene like? Well, without being spoilery, I'll say two things: one, it's NOT a big reveal or anything like that, but two, it's really funny if you have a knowledge of a certain old Marvel character. Oh yeah, and you get to play everyone's favourite game in the movie - 'Spot Stan Lee'. It just wouldn't be the same without him mugging it up somewhere.In closing, ""Guardians Of The Galaxy"" is right up there with the rest of Marvel's cinematic output, making a clear mark by being totally different to anything else we've so far seen. It's Fun with a capital 'F', and engaging throughout. Some of the violence may be a bit much for smaller kids, and there's a bit of moderately fruity language (is 'dick' fruity still? I fall behind sometimes). That said, kids who don't mind a walking tree impaling people or a raccoon murderising people with a kick ass gun will have a blast. Big, beautiful and bad ass, ""Guardians Of The Galaxy"" is definitely the feel good fantasy of 2014, as evidenced by the grin still stuck to my face. All together now... ""I'm hooked on a feeling..."""
"You might expect a movie studio at the top of its game to play it safe rather than strike out in new, bizarre directions. Certainly, it's hard to imagine any other studio giving the greenlight to Guardians Of The Galaxy - a huge blockbuster movie based on a title unfamiliar to anyone who isn't a comics aficionado, starring a relatively unknown actor playing a character most people have never heard of. And yet, Marvel scores once again with its willingness to head off the beaten track. GUARDIANS is a fun, fizzy delight, even as it mines some surprising depths of emotion from its ragtag group of anti-heroes.Peter Quill (Pratt) - a human abducted from Earth as a child - has grown up into an intergalactic thief who has no idea what he's getting into when he takes possession of a mysterious Orb. Little does he know that Ronan (Pace) - a genocidal Kree radical - will do just about anything to get his hands on said Orb, including sending alien assassin Gamora (Saldana) after it. Gamora, as it turns out, has an agenda of her own. Trapped in an intergalactic prison (long story), Peter and Gamora are forced into an uneasy alliance with three other misfits: a brainy, sarcastic raccoon-like creature named Rocket (voiced by Cooper), a giant tree by the name of Groot (Diesel), and the vengeance-minded Drax The Destroyer (Bautista).The truth is that there's almost too much going on in GUARDIANS. Not only do we meet a host of characters we've never met before, on a raft of new planets teeming with brightly coloured life and detail, we're also introduced to several plot lines all stuffed somewhat awkwardly into the film. We have Ronan's planet-destroying aspirations, which are somehow bound up with the evil plans of Thanos - that creepy purple- skinned dude who popped up at the end of The Avengers. Peter's kidnappers turned surrogate 'family' are also on the trail of the Orb, turning up at moments both enormously convenient and inconvenient to the plot. It all makes sense in the end, but until it all clicks into place, it can make for a rushed, unsettling experience.But, despite its occasionally unwieldy script, GUARDIANS triumphs because of the gang of scruffy losers (a term that will take on a different, more heartfelt meaning during the film) at its heart. Director James Gunn, who co-wrote the script, clearly feels a strong affinity for each one of these outcasts, all of whom are easily outlaws in some (if not all) parts of the solar system, each one battling - at least initially - to save his or her own skin rather than to save the world. It's fascinating to watch the five members of this unlikely group slowly banter, bicker and batter their way into becoming a team.Most joyfully of all, Gunn never loses sight of the prickly, selfish side of his characters. He gives them plenty of rich, emotional moments - whether it's Peter and Gamora bonding over the loss of their parents, or Rocket's ability to read a whole range of meaning into Groot's extremely limited vocabulary ('I am Groot') - but never allows the film to descend into dangerously sentimental territory.In fact, Gunn pumps up proceedings with a healthy, hearty dose of humour. Films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) have always been more tongue-in-cheek than the likes of the considerably more dour Dark Knight franchise, but GUARDIANS is a heady trip of a different order. It practically delights in bursts of odd, subversive comedy, and actually dares to punctuate its most epic face-off with a sly homage to, of all things, Footloose.Pratt - so winning in TV's Parks And Recreation - holds the emotional core of the film together. He exudes an easy, rakish charm that makes Peter both dashingly arrogant and achingly vulnerable. He's matched very well by Saldana, who is clearly delighting in the opportunity to play the world-weary, no-nonsense Gamora - bred into a killer, born a fighter. The rest of the cast does justice, too, to the film's cheerful swing from drama to comedy and back again: Bautista brings unexpected pathos to Drax's occasionally comical determination to avenge his family against Ronan, while Cooper sounds completely unlike himself - in a very good way - as a creature who hides a world of hurt beneath his mouthy exterior. Even Diesel manages to find a great deal of depth in a CGI character who only communicates via the same languid burst of three words.If anything, GUARDIANS is let down by a trio of not particularly threatening villains. Pace snarls and spits in heavy make-up, but can't quite rustle up much in the way of nuance or genuine menace. Ronan is a one-note madman, with so little in the way of backstory that he automatically becomes less interesting. Thanos, too, now voiced and performed in motion-capture by Brolin, doesn't get much to do beyond lounge on his space throne. Only Gillan's cyborg Nebula manages a smidgen of complexity; even then, she struggles to be half as fascinating as her conflicted ""sister"", Gamora.Before the film was even released in cinemas, Marvel announced that a sequel would be coming in 2017. It's a no-brainer as to why. The film is smart, funny and quite wonderful on its own merits. But, even more crucially, GUARDIANS is a gamble that pays off handsomely for Marvel. It opens up the MCU in, quite literally, all directions. Don't be surprised if you see our more earth-bound heroes heading into space sooner rather than later. The film also adds a new cast of lovable rogues to the MCU's roster of characters: a gang who, one might say, are actually all the more heroic for being people who would ordinarily be running in the opposite direction from any galaxy-guarding duties. Frankly, we can't wait to see what they get up to next."
"(Rating: 12A, 121 mins) Written by Zen Terrelonge Starring – Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Bradley Cooper, Dave Bautista, Vin DieselIf you've seen the trailers for Guardians of the Galaxy, you'd be within your rights to think Marvel Studio execs have been hitting the bottle hard or taking LSD.The film revolves around a group of dysfunctional but goodhearted criminals – think Robin Hood's Merry Men of the future – comprising human thief Peter Quill aka Star-Lord (Pratt), green assassin Gamora (Saldana), talking raccoon Rocket (Cooper), knife-wielding Drax the Destroyer (Bautista), and walking tree Groot (Diesel).Like the Avengers, the Guardians get off to a false start but soon unite over a common cause, namely, the galaxy being obliterated by genocidal maniac, Ronan – not Keating – the Accuser.Ah yes, the old, let's-exterminate-everyone-for-the-mistakes-of-their-forefathers ploy.But unlike Avengers Assemble, Guardians of the Galaxy oozes offbeat originality and frankly, it's the most unique and delightful film Marvel has created to date.It's a hell of an achievement given the extensive movie library the company is building up and when you consider the characters aren't household names like 'big three' Iron Man, Thor and Captain America, but Marvel seems well aware of that fact with the final production risky to say the least.The film opens in 1988, which is when Quill is abducted from Earth, and 26 years later we see he's become a crooked intergalactic outlaw with a taste for all things shiny, valuable and not his.Given the distinct decade in which he was taken, his cassette player and mixtape of 70s and 80s tracks are laced throughout the film, which creates a quirky yet grounded quality in the midst of all of the dazzling interstellar warfare that takes place along the way.In addition to the soundtrack, jokes and comedy have never been more of a feature in a Marvel film – perhaps Iron Man 3 was the closest – as gags are thrown into the unlikeliest of scenarios to lessen the tension, and I would imagine, to really differentiate itself from Avengers Assemble, Star Wars and Star Trek, which by comparison are left looking very sombre.That said, if you were going to compare Pratt's Quill to someone, the character is quite reminiscent of Chris Pine's Captain James Kirk – smart, womanising, reckless leaders, who eventually find their feet.The editing is supreme and makes each bit of dialogue super-sharp and tight, so when the infamous five are bickering or talking generally, the repartee all feels really clean and natural without being awkward or forced.Thor can be stubborn, Iron Man can be arrogant and Captain America is considered too stiff, but all of the Guardians bring even more wildly different qualities to the table and offer some diversity that doesn't ever grate or bore, which wouldn't have been possible without such excellent casting.Meanwhile, the film is very much in the here and now, with Quill's backstory the only one that truly gets a look-in, which creates a sense of intrigue about his colleagues who only have their pasts hinted at, meaning sequel fodder.There's just no way of knowing where you're going and tonally the movie delivers a piece of everything and it's done big and without hesitation.Guardians may have been a gamble, but I'm Grooting for it to Rocket to the top.10/10"
"With each new film they release, Marvel outdo themselves time after time, from 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' to 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' and now to this amazing and irreverent superhero space opera packed full of humour and action in a visually stunning galaxy. Admittedly, I have slowly become more and more bored with superhero films since the high point of DC's 'The Dark Knight' and Marvel's 'Avengers', however 'Guardians' was something that was truly different, something that truly blew me away and has, as a result, become what is arguably my favourite Marvel film. Previous Marvel films have tried too hard to place humour in situations that didn't require it, 'Guardians of the Galaxy' however employs it frequently and due to the constant stream of jokes it works perfectly. Chris Pratt is by far one of Marvel's best casting choices since Robert Downey Jr. as 'Iron Man', even beyond this the other acting bodies were cast perfectly. The visual effects are utterly stunning and the battle scenes are epic, 'Guardians' is a truly amazing and thrilling superhero flick full of visual splendour."
"Recently, I began to understand that I was tired of blockbusters: these incredibly spectacular, voluminous, incredibly expensive, but by and large similar to each other and empty films. In 2014, apart from bitter disappointments like the ""New Spider-Man 2"", there were really standing copies (whether the new ""X-Men"" or ""The Face of the Future""), but they also failed to arouse my special trepidation. And that's why I did not expect the ""Guardians of the galaxy"". And if it were not for my long-standing affection for the Marvel universe and the invitation for the preposition, I probably would not even have gone to this film and ... Much would have lost!During the viewing of ""The Guardians of the Galaxy"" I was surprised at the fact that it was gradually becoming ecstatic. I could not imagine that I can still empathize with screen characters and laugh at their words and deeds. This film really gave me back the love of blockbusters and revived the hope that in the film world of fiction it is really possible to do something new and unusual.And now I will try to briefly note those components of the film that bribed me the most.1. Cool plot. This tape contains several storylines, which, due to the abundance of central characters, are revealed as completely as possible. The main action is twisted around an artifact, which everyone abducts from one another. However, developing this storyline, the creators of the tape have time to give us and a spectacular escape from prison, and many spectacular interplanetary battles, and the history of the formation of a real strong friendship between the five main characters. The plot develops very rapidly and practically does not sag, keeping spectators intrigued to the very titles. Personally, I would have sopped the melodramatic part of the film, however, the reaction of the viewers to these episodes was absolutely normal, so it's more of my harmfulness and natural cynicism, and not some miscalculations of the writers.
By the way, the film itself is more associated with ""Star Trek"" or ""Star Wars"". So not special lovers of the Marvel universe can appreciate this tape.2. Excellent humor. ""Guardians of the galaxy"" is a very funny film. And the cool thing is that here there is a place of self-irony, as the tape makers coolly ridicule various clichés peculiar to blockbusters. In general, it is necessary to see and hear. Probably, this is the most cheerful film of this year, although according to official information it is not even a comedy.3. Team spirit. I remember two years earlier I was choking with enthusiasm, praising the Avengers precisely for their team unity. However, one can not help but notice that in the Ironman and the company the team spirit was a little bit pretentious. The heroes were constantly measured ... hmm ... by forces, and the friendly atmosphere was relegated to the background. In the ""Guardians of the galaxy"", things are different: the characters are so different that they have nothing to compete with. This five of the losers (and they call themselves that) form a real friendly union, which more than ever realizes the principle ""We are different, but we are together.""In connection with the above, it makes sense to mention the work of a stunning cast of actors. Chris Pratt creates a very bright character who can compete with his own charisma, even with Tony Stark himself. It's amazing that I did not pay attention to this actor before: after watching, I was surprised to find that I already watched a dozen films with his participation. Now I will follow with interest the development of his career. Zoe Saldana confirms the status of the most unearthly actress of our time, adding to her track record a new alien image of the charming and daring Gamora. Professional wrestler Dave Batista is very organic in his role. I think he definitely has a future in the film industry. Very pleased with such venerable professionals of their business as Benicio Del Toro, Glenn Close and John Ci Riley, although, not soon, that these fantastic actors would like to see on the screen a little more.
Rocket Raccoon is also a rocket (or for many of the fair sex - milash raccoon) - this is the main bomb of the whole film. I can not appreciate the work of Bradley Cooper, since I watched the film in Russian dubbing (which, by the way, is also surprisingly very good). But the character is simply amazing! The hall came in a raging rapture, it cost the raccoon only to appear on the screen. Definitely, this is a find without which this film would not have been so successful. Spectator love was won by another character - Grut (or, again, for many girls and children - just a Tree). By the way, the incredibly laborious work of Vin Diesel on the voice acting of this character you can appreciate in Russian dubbing.4. Bright special effects. What to say, the film is bright, very beautiful and voluminous. A real holiday for the eyes, on which it is worth to fork out, in order to appreciate all this beauty in IMAX 3D.5. Music! Even if the film leaves you absolutely indifferent, then the music just needs to please you. The creators of the ribbon collected just the cream, the quintessential culture of the 70s, choosing bright, favorite, but un-played tracks. I was really pleased to share some of this amazing culture with my friends who, outside of this movie, would not for anything agree to listen to ""this is not necessary for old people"".TOTAL. ""Guardians of the galaxy"" is a completely crazy blockbuster that charges the audience with a positive and undoubtedly captivates with an incredibly warm atmosphere, exciting plot, bright special effects, killer jokes and a genuine team spirit. For the first time in a very long time, I felt this naive childlike feeling: I did not want to leave the cinema and leave this amazing, incredibly convincing and soulful world, which was given to us by the creators of the ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" Probably, this is the first blockbuster this year, which I will want to reconsider. And this is the rare film that I want to assess neither from the point of view of a critic who cares at trifles and searches for story inconsistencies, but from the point of view of the viewer who can easily be bribed by a talking raccoon and a smiling tree.
That's why I highly recommend watching this movie literally to all viewers. And that's why ""The Guardians of the Galaxy"" is becoming a movie that I without any qualms of conscience put an unprecedented 9 points, which I have not been awarded with yet another film from the universe I adore Marvel.Enjoy watching!"
"So Guardians of the Galaxy is finally out and how is it?....it matches every expectation you had about it. Essentially, it is an absurdly fun, cheesy, old-fashioned space adventure with a superhero edge. For those of you who didn't know, the Guardians are pretty much the polar opposite of the Avengers - they're loud, brash, free-spirited, and most of all.....human....or as human as you can be being 4 aliens and 1 human. Unlike the Avengers, they don't play nice when it comes to saving the galaxy.This movie has so much going for it that you can't really explain it in one paragraph but all you need to know is that the humour is great, the action is non-stop, the drama is riveting and genuinely heartwarming, the soundtrack rocks and unlike most superhero teams - everyone of the guardians are 100% awesome in their own way.I won't spoil the plot for you but i will say that what makes Guardians work so well is that it has a genuinely good-natured, back to basics, rock n' roll approach that has swagger and style aplenty. Despite their late entry into the Marvel franchise, rest assured that the guardians are here stay and will be defending a galaxy near you soon."
"I know, I know. This will incontrovertibly attract a lot of hate from die-hard Dark Knight fans, but guess what? I'm one of those who thinks Nolan is the epitome of how to make a perfect superhero spectacle. Or at least, I was until tonight. This film will blow your mind. Quite literally, it is jam-packed with edge-of-your-seat action thrills and pure comedic gold. Don't be expecting a moody companion piece like that of Nolan's trilogy, or Man of Steel. It keeps more in touch with Avengers, although it's a lot funnier and really builds upon the upcoming Infinity Gauntlet arc. The actors are incredible, matching the character developments, the dialogue and action sequences are spectacular and the visual effects should surely earn a nod come Oscar time, as I'd personally put them on par with those seen in the recent Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. The run length compliments the well-scripted pacing of the movie itself, whilst plenty of interesting secondary characters litter Guardians with an ensemble cast that has exceeded anything yet seen in the Marvel/DC movie worlds. I don't pertain to the DC versus Marvel argument, but this masterpiece alone has certainly put Marvel on the front foot in terms of cinema outings, far surpassing the very enjoyable Man of Steel and, I believe, edging out Nolan's trilogy and then some. I thoroughly recommend this for any with a borderline sci-fi/superhero love, and advise you to remain for the tantalising post-credits scene, although many of the non-comic fans might not get the references. Easily a perfect ten out of ten for me."
"Like a lot of other people, I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie. To say it exceeded my expectations would be an understatement. It's a clever and fresh gem in the stable of Marvel films. One of the best they've put out so far. The script is full of funny lines but it's also got lots of good character stuff with earned emotional moments. The action and effects are nice. The cast is great, including those just doing voices. Chris Pratt does a wonderful job blending the comic relief with the superhero. The soundtrack of old pop songs is terrific and integrated into the plot perfectly. The homages to Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and more are fun. Which is the simplest and best word to describe this movie: fun. You'll have a blast watching it."
"What happens when Marvel pulls out five relatively unknown characters of its own, who have a terrible chemistry with each other, and decides to make a movie out of the mess?The result is surprisingly good.Guardians of the Galaxy starts out as an unholy alliance of five unlikely companions: a space rogue (Indiana Jones + Han Solo much?), a righteous assassin, an annoying tech-whiz raccoon, a humanoid tree, and a thespian prisoner on a vendetta, all of whom pursue their own more or less selfish goals. Without revealing much, they are joined together by the mysterious Orb, a crucial device for the plot.The movie is packed with chaotic and continuous action. No slow sections mid-movie, no meaningless pieces of dialog. Everything is so well- knitted in its weirdness that I'm beginning to consider the whole even greater than immediately after the show. It's fascinating to follow how the different personas co-operate despite their differences, and the leading actors thrive in their roles, doing amazing work! In addition, for an action movie, the plot has some very touching moments during which I had to fight not to shed some manly tears in the theater.The space is beautiful, and so is this movie. One breathtaking vista after another, visual orgasms will be guaranteed.When looking for flaws on purpose, the biggest con throughout the movie might be the overuse of the jokes and one-liners, some good, some not. However, they are a part of the spirit of the work. Furthermore, I'm sure that the 1970's soundtrack will divide opinions. I'm not particularly fond of it, on the one hand, the songs felt dime a dozen and alien as I didn't grow up with them nor knew them save one, why not use some other tracks? Either the movie was targeted to people over 30, or the authors wanted to use their favorite songs. Oh, one last thing! Did the Dark Aster really have to be so ridiculously gigantic?There's a squirrel with a big gun. He's the sole thing I remember about the flick's poster, and later he turned out to be a genetically enhanced raccoon. Anyways, he gave me the impression that this was going to be a tongue-in-cheek version of the Avengers, which was partially true. Massively superior, Guardians of the Galaxy is an idiosyncratic masterpiece amongst the blockbuster movies of Hollywood.All in all, Guardians of the Galaxy turns out to be unexpectedly funny and warm adventure that has all the rights for its cliffhanger ending and oh, we will be waiting for that sequel!Rating: 4,5/5"
"So , I was yesterday to see this ""big"" movie, which has a rating of 8.7, close to ""The lord of the rings"" movies, the same as ""Matrix"" or ""Inception"" and even better than ""Seven"" or ""Usual suspects"". It should be good right? Doesn't matter that Marvel made only crap movies, most of them anyway, with a few exceptions, some of the first Spiderman movies and some X-men movies, maybe they nailed it this time.So, the movie starts and after the first scenes, we see our hero on an abandoned planet, dancing as he goes to collect the item he came for. He is not thinking that while he is listening music at his headset, someone may be nearby. Anyway, he got what he came for, and the scene is very similar to the one in Indiana Jones. No surprise, this entire movie is a rip -off of other movies, you have you hero which is a smuggler and becomes one of the good guys (Star wars), you have a pair, a raccoon and a tree, only the raccoon understands the tree (Star wars), again, our hero out of the nowhere falls in love with the female(again.... Star wars), only in Star Wars, the process was more real and more fun. Also, like other Marvel movies, the characters do illogical actions in the most important moments. Gomora after she fights to the death with her sister trying to cut the power, tries to save her when her sister was holding on the edge of the ship, while Peter Quill and the others were waiting for Gomora to cut the damn power. Another stupid moment was when Ronan, at last he lands, but he doesn't destroy the planet, the thing he wanted the most to do, no, he looks at our hero dancing... speechless... And how did Drax survived when he and Ronan are hit by a ship at full speed, piloted by raccoon?So, Guardians of the galaxy is a movie full of meaningless special effects, explosions after explosions, characters that are poorly written, actors that don't act very well, a poor script and ideas borrowed from other movies.Conclusion, another boring movie by Marvel, highly over rated, I don't know how, I think Marvel fans are overzealous or the people are just getting dumber day by day.You wanna see a good sci-fi movie, watch any of the Star Wars movies."
"In a previous review, one writer said that Marvel could have ""played it safe, but went into a bold new direction"".Well I don't know about you, but filling a movie with pop culture references to hook the money-spending adult-child demographic of 30 and 40 somethings, in what is quite literally ""just another sci-fi adventure"", is NOT taking a risk.From the very minute the film started I knew I was going to be manipulated in the most direct way, but even then sometimes you ask for it, like watching ""Old Yeller"" for example. But in the case of GOTG, it's pretty much shoveled in our mouths from the beginning, and with more than a spoonful of sugar.Some have compared this movie to Star Wars (which it's not), and even while that film was derivative of Saturday morning serials and classic science fiction films and TV, what made Star Wars unique is the creative ways it tips it's hat at the genre, and more specifically how hard everyone worked to make it their own. There was more depth to it, and it left you wondering, ""didn't we see that in something else""? However GOTG embellishes with pop culture, very much like the roller-coaster ride operator who turns on the top 40 or R&B station while he locks you in your seat. That's not creating something unique, it's hopping on the back of something that's previously established, and it takes no effort to do so, only money.But don't take my word for it, see for yourself. In going through the other reviews, on almost every page someone writes their summary as ""Hooked on a Feeling"". If that doesn't resemble Pavlov's Dog, I don't know what else could.I DID like Guardian's of the Galaxy for it's art design, effects, stunts, sound design, and the battered underscore by Tyler Bates which was brilliant. But with scenes in which we have Chris Pratt making Kevin Bacon sound like a universal liberator of man during a romantic scene with Zoe Saldana, (and who references his name later in the film like a punch line) this movie is the epitome of that age old prediction, ""Pop Will Eat Itself"".Speaking of Pratt, I felt he's probably the weakest leading man I've ever encountered in a blockbuster film. He felt like a composite of Indiana Jones, Norma Rae and Oliver Twist all mixed into one. I cared not a single moment for his well being, his past or even his future. So no, Marvel didn't play it safe. Not by a long shot. They knew what they were doing when they licensed these songs, filled the dialog with prime time nods and then threw a bunch of fireworks at us. Not having read the comic, if these same kinds of references are in there, I'm sure I will find out soon enough. But that just reinforces my argument anyway, and leaves one to ask if we should expect more depth of storytelling, character development and not-so-easy references to day to day life from big budget features (I do!), or is it safe to say that today's blockbuster films will sacrifice originality for commonality and we should just go with it?Either way, since this is obviously the first in a new franchise, I'm sure we will find out what Marvel's priorities are in the next installment. Let's hope it's not just ""The next Empire Strikes Back""."
"As a fan of Marvel movies I was excited to see Guardians of the Galaxy. However, this movie failed on several levels.It is supposed to a comedy but the jokes are not funny. I genuinely laughed once. Furthermore, one 'joke' was weirdly inappropriate.The story is completely generic. It seems like they just needed some story, any story, as a vehicle for the characters to get together and try to be funny.I wanted to write a review without spoilers but the big set-piece ending of a spaceship crashing into the ground has to be called out. This was done in the Avengers and Star Trek: Into Darkness. To me, it's like directors have to have this '9/11' shot in every movie (big thing crashes into buildings) and it has to stop. It's boring now.The only positive about this movie was the special effects and space backgrounds.It seems that Marvel have figured out punters will pay cash money for any old junk if its wrapped up in special effects and a decent soundtrack. I will approach the next Marvel with extreme caution, and I will not see Guardians of the Galaxy 2."
"The plot was predictable. The characters aren't original. I guess the younger crowd and die hard fans will probably like it but as an avid movie fan Guardians kind of disappointed me. Acting was kind of terrible too. Bautista played Drax as if Drax was TRYING to sound intelligent. He couldn't pull off the smart brute. Zoe tried too hard to be bad a$$ and it wasn't natural. The Collector... Don't get me started... What reason was there for The Collector to even open and show anybody the Infinity Stone? It's a super powerful object that he knew was very powerful, why show Thanos' daughter or the outlaw? The bad guys were the worst, so campy. Ronin reminded me of a pro wrestler during an interview. Like Ultimate Warrior on a rant. Only good acting came from Thanos and Rocket. Yep, the CGIs. The final battle was whack. The ships lined up to form a net to stop the super ship and the good guy ships were below shooting bad guy ships who we're dive bombing the city. The worst was when they tried to replicate that scene in Avengers when Hulk was slamming Loki around but instead it was Groot shooting his tendrils through a bunch of bad guys and skewering them then slamming them unnecessarily back and forth against walls. The ending was so cheesy when John C Reiley was all sappy about his wife and kid being saved who they showed in the end as a woman and her daughter who earlier was part of a scene where they were almost crushed. Booooring.... The movie wasn't terrible but after reading the super reviews on IMDb, I had to say something."
"Guardians of the Galaxy is just another mediocre film. Under the pretence of future, it sneaked in embraces of the past. Perhaps it tried to be both, but it was neither a serious film nor a comedy. It failed to trigger any deeper emotion inside me. Its humour was out of context. There were too many characters, most of which were not properly developed. The purposes of existence of those figures were very confusing. I'll comment in detail on the triggering of deeper emotions and the humour in the following 2 paragraphs.Someone commented that the films like the Dark knights series set a standard that superhero films must be deep and thoughtful. That person further commented that this film, Guardians of the Galaxy challenged this standard. I generally don't like dogmas. But here it's not at all about dogmas. It is just the fact that those ""deep"" ones could trigger deeper emotions, or provoke thoughts, or inspire the audiences, or help the audiences learn something, or help the audiences learn themselves better. By these, the audiences like, think about, involuntarily recall, remember and give high scores for those ""deep"" films. Of course different people have different opinions on deepness. So, I don't comment on the deepness of Guardians of the Galaxy. Just commenting on triggering deeper emotions, or provoking thoughts, or inspiring me, or helping me learn something or learn myself better, unfortunately, Guardians of the Galaxy did none of these to me. So, it just didn't make me feel that way, that it was one of those all-time great films.Someone commented that Guardians of the Galaxy was not a serious film, but rather, it was a great, light-hearted comedy. Even for this, I don't think I could agree. Great humour exists in context. In the right context, something plain could be hilarious. Out of context, brilliant jokes were just nothing. In Guardians of the Galaxy, too much humour ran out of context. For example, the raccoon said later, that he asked for one prisoner's prosthetic leg was just a joke. What did this convey? It was clever to play such heartless jokes on your partners when it was time to be serious? No. How about it tried to portray a figure, the raccoon, who was unfazed in front of great danger? But then you had to make the situation look dangerous. Even in The Wizard of Oz (1939), the scenes felt more creepy than here in the prison. The prison here felt just like a noisy second-hand market. So, I didn't find the joke funny and didn't know why it was in the film otherwise either. There were many such lines. I knew they were intended to be something to make people laugh, but I just didn't feel that entertained at those improper moments.All in all, Guardians of the Galaxy has no place on the all-time great list. Perhaps it was the last joke it could play, on itself, being put into the Top 250 list. Among those great films, its mediocrity would just manifest itself. Just within the first month of its release, it dropped 20 places on the Top 250 list from the 34th to the 54th. As time goes on, this film will likely drop further when the enthusiasm fades after its initial surge. There are great films, like In the Name of the Father (1993), A Beautiful Mind (2001) etc. They were not on the Top 250 list before, but gradually rose up and emerged into the all-time great list. Just on the contrary, Guardians of the Galaxy will gradually drop out of the Top 250 list."
"I thought it would only be fair giving this 1 star, even though it's maybe - at BEST - a 4, because this is definitely not worth 8. GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY was a shot I chose to try in god knows how long since I've been to the cinema. This is just another load of Hollywood trash. I had the impression it was innovative, considering the Guardians being pulled out from the bottom of the pile and the whole outlaw thing... but I was wrong...IN THE BEGINNING, what's-his-name is on Earth and it is APPARENTLY '88. The kid's mother dies. OK. Is this meant to be emotional despite the fact I have no attachment to any of these characters yet? OH WOW IT'S THE FUTURE NOW!! I'm sorry; his mother dies, he goes outside and then he gets abducted? What is this supposed to signify? Not to mention it's (obviously) unbelievably and strangely timed, but this is probably an attempt at giving some depth to the main character, but really doesn't do ANYTHING for the major plot of the entire film.The rest of the film was just a bunch of underdogs coming together because they end up in the same space prison (because what happens when you're arrested together is you share a block, not to mention gender is no issue here). Then they fall into this orb situation. What is it? It.. it is this orb.. and it is powerful.. a bit like the cube or something. There was little development in the story at all really, a few changes in direction but no real twists or anything surprising. I don't even know, I was almost asleep half the time. I was constantly checking my watch to see when it was over.So we have hideous CGI here. Ridiculously unprofessional, but I guess I'm not in with the CGI in blockbusters. They have this obnoxious claim to fame with technology it seems; having the ability to do these things doesn't make it cool, it just looks like a video game. Another thing, visually, was the designs. It was just so typical of the action/sci-fi genre in the technology and whatnot, and the characters... very much in the same boat but more-so thrown together effortlessly.Then after that its all EXPLOSIONS - SPEEDING - ADVERTISING - HITTING! In between there's a conceited amount of one liners that made me cringe. The best kind. And in the end we have some false suspense because we know everything is going to be okay.OVERALL: >The comedy was... horrid... >The story was simple. >The characters were lacking in... everything really. -The cinematography didn't even involve cameras. >The soundtrack was a bunch of pop classics chucked together. So what was good about it? The ACTION!!!1111 Wait, no... >The action was too much, unnecessary and clearly there to fill in time. Main reason I even saw this was I received an invitation from some mates. I think I'll try go back to sticking to films with a point. The only point of this was to brainwash and make big bucks."
"Well if the universe has the corner stone of idiots this is it. Guardians of the galaxy comprised of five dolts who come together in the face of total annihilation from what is known as the Infinifty stone. A relic of ancient past where its properties are made up of the building blocks that created the universe itself. It could be used to create or to destroy. Between planets is a man named Quill who at a younger age was abducted from earth by an alien trash race lead by Yondu Udonta (Micheal Rooker) after his mother died from severe cancer.Some fifteen years later he becomes a relic hunter and not always by legal means. During his last trek to an abandoned planet he comes across this stone housed in an orb but is confronted by a league of trackers lead by Korath (Djimon Hounsou) who works for Ronan (Lee Pace). Ronan is by no means a nice guy. In fact he only wants the stone for revenge against another race who used the stones power to alter the natural means of creation but was destroyed in doing so. Taking ronan's people with them he vowed revenge at any cost.Now with quill's group is Drax (Dave Bautista) Gamora (Zoe Saldana) Groot (Voiced By Vin Diesel) and last is the over emotional Rocket (Bradley Cooper) who looks like a raccoon. Together they put aside their differences... that is to stop trying to kill each other and put an end to ronan from destroying the entire universe in the process. In many ways this movie holds a great deal of emotions from beginning to end. Passionate, anger, betrayal, the kind of self centred pessimism one looks for in another in order to get their point across no matter the cost.It is a big universe where many alien life forms dwell including Quill's own father who had kept his identity a secret from his family. Quill only learnt his entire being is half Terran, and half earth. Knowing this he decides to change over a new leaf to become a guardian with his new found friends and try to get along without throwing a fit. I had a great time watching this with the new characters, new action, and wonderful retro music that just somehow fit to quill's character. What I also found interesting is seeing how the other half lives out there in the deepest parts of space. Come to think of it they are not all that dissimilar from anyone else.Each has a family, dreams, goals, even opportunities which presents themselves evil or not. I give it ten stars for originality, music, special effects, and wonderful actors including an Oscar winner Benicio Del Toro who plays the pawn master that appraises the stone's value. Guardians of the galaxy is much better than Galaxy Quest for its story line, and optimistic characters. You couldn't take your eyes off of any alien in this film it is that well made. Highly recommended to all ages above 14. Excellent addition to the summer."
"The movie was recommended to me by a friend who saw the reviews and somehow believed those. Huge mistake.To say the movie is childish would be an honor for this movie, I have seen plenty of animated movies which were a huge lot better.The story is dumb and entirely predictable. The characters are almost flat and have absolutely no credibility from either a serious point of view nor from a parody point of view. Acting was also poor.Visual effects were OK and being a 3D movie helped, but that is the only positive thing that I can say about the movie.The theater was half-full but during the entire movie there was not a single time when you could hear everybody laughing hard.The only way I can imagine that so many 9 and 10 star reviews were added for this movie is since all the brainwashed Marvel fan-boys and sock-puppets for the studios somehow managed to overwhelm normal reviewers."
"I love Marvel. Whether it be X-Men, Thor, The Avengers, Spider-man, Iron Man... most of the commonly known ones, of course, but I always loved them. But to put this as simply as I can -though that doesn't mean this will be short-, this film was filled with 1,000 of the most common clichés extracted from these great films and stories and crammed them into one mashed-up, jumpy, unreserved, ridiculous, abnormal, spiteful, detestable, idiotic, moronic, absurd, ludicrous, senseless, meaningless, pointless, terribly-written, unbelievably- unrealistic, super-super-super-hero-wannabe movie that very desperately AND obviously AND obnoxiously attempts to special-effect everything -and I mean everything- to simply gain some big bucks because, hey, it's Marvel, what could go wrong? It's sad to see how successful their attempts were; I fell for it... for me, it's all due to The Avengers because that was freaking amazing, even though it had a lot of commonplace stuff. And boy, do I regret wasting my two hours on this extremely disappointing collage. Basically, it's a film made of collages because everything just had to be colorful in outer space. No seriously. Of course everything is colorful there. It's not like the galaxy is filled with 96% dark matter that is called DARK for a reason. So yeah. Totally makes sense. And your skin also starts rotting in outer-space, too. Serious case of leprosy then? I liked Elektra more than this. I'd rather have watched that five times. Kind of feel like that says something. The only reasons I smiled or laughed was because the directors and script writers were decent at making corny jokes, puns, and lines funny enough that giggling is impossible prevent unless you are emotionless. They should have gone with comedy, rather than action-adventure, though, since I sincerely thought the rest of the moments were just junk. Call me a spoil-sport if you must, but I was literally whispering what would happen in the next minute to my friend beside me. Usually I'm not very good at predicting what happens in films -unless they are seriously full of clichés...which this film is-, but I said them anyway. I was right 8 times. Out of 9. I counted. Anyway... though the beautiful graphics did rival that of Avatar, the plot of ""saving the people from the evil mastermind only this time it involves the whole galaxy instead of just one planet so it's not just Earth that's being targeted this time so ha we are different"" never got THIS tiring. I was so close to sinking in my chair and dreaming up a nightmare because of how stupidly predictable this film was. Maybe that was intentional and Marvel fans just wanted to see some new, more unique heroes this time, and also to see the visuals, and maybe to see Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana's pretty butts...but whatever. I had half that mind prepared for a cliché-turned- awesome movie when I walked in the theater. I came out with my whole mind filling up and overloading with shame and displeasure.So, plot: Would have been old and good but it wasn't. Protagonists: I would have cared for them more if the filmmakers didn't blow up almost everyone's favorite guy and kept alive some people's least-liked guy(s). So, yeah. Villains: ... oh my gosh, no, seriously? What even happened to the evil robot woman? Did the filmmakers just completely forget her? Music: Louder than Inception's horn. And I loved that even though it had no tune. Couldn't stand this though. But still, be ready for some rocking 80s and 90s music that I would have downloaded if they didn't play those songs during totally inappropriate moments. Comedy relief my butt. The only relief I got out of the soundtrack that isn't even their soundtrack -hopefully they didn't violate any copy rights... I mean, if it's these filmmakers, I wouldn't be surprised- is that I'm glad Groot enjoyed himself. Visuals: Stunning. That wasn't sarcastic at all. At all. What else? Oh yeah, unless you pay me a million dollars, I would never watch the sequel. So sorry I can't contribute ten dollars for Marvel next time. Tough luck.Don't let this review stop you though. Most of my friends liked it. And of course, most people who reviewed this movie liked it, so I guess I'm just a jerk. I'm betting you readers agree, and that's totally understandable since I am totally venting. But hey, three out of four of my friends never watched a Marvel movie so... call me bluffing, but I sincerely experienced one of the deepest disappointments I have ever dealt with in regards to a movie franchise in my entire life.... I'm still going to watch X-men though. Dang you, Marvel."
"I'm wondering, after seeing the reviews for this movie on IMDb, if this was the same movie I saw at the pictures a few weeks ago, because it absolutely boggles my mind how people can give this movie a 10/10 rating.Now, when I saw it I wasn't particularly disappointed, as I came in expecting a light-hearted childish story that passed the time, and that is exactly what it was, and I didn't feel ripped off for paying to go and see it. I really regarded it as a superhero B Movie with a big budget. It was fun but wasn't memorable at all, and there was nothing in the movie that made me really think or challenge my perspective on a particular topic, which is what I expect from a movie which is deemed by the public to be a classic.But this entirely wasn't the case. The plot line was simple, there was little to no character development or any notable acting performances, and the humour was completely childish and only really funny for someone aged 11 or under. There was no wit, satire, intelligence or anything really interesting in the movie and it was all set in your average Hollywood feel-good family fun movie template, which really doesn't appeal to mature tastes in cinema.Now, I have to say I'm not a big superhero movie fan and I'd never buy a DVD for a superhero movie, but even for a superhero movie this one wasn't even that good. In my book it was about the same quality as another superhero I recently saw, which was The Amazing Spiderman 2, which is rated about 6 or 7. Personally I can't tell how this movie is any better or worse than that movie, after all, both were cliché feel-good films with a very simple plot.I have to admit I wouldn't have even bothered writing a review for this movie had it not been for the ridiculously high rating it received on IMDb. Its 8.6 out of 10 at the minute. 8.6? That puts it ahead of absolute classics such as Django Unchained, Full Metal Jacket and Taxi Driver. How on earth this movie can be considered better than those movies is utterly unthinkable. They aren't even in the same league. This movie is several leagues below that.I hope that the rating has subsequently gone down to somewhere between 6 and 7 if you're reading this in the not-so distant future, because that's where this B Movie with a big budget really belongs."
"They should really call themselves the best film of 2014, because that is what it is! Anyway as you can probably tell, this is my review for the new Marvel movie Guardians of the Galaxy. They're like the B-Rate Avengers and on a different planet. Xandar to be exact. Anywho's, the plot. The Plot: A human adventurer teams up with a band of alien misfits to save the galaxy.Now, first I wanna say this. The soundtrack was freaking awesome. You have songs from Hooked on a Feeling by Blue Swede, I Want You Back by The Jackson 5, and many awesome songs like that, these songs were on Peter Quill's mix tape. Next, the opening scene. Wow. One of the most emotional opening scenes in Marvel film history. Not gonna spoil it, but all I'm saying is that it has one of the most epic transitions from scene to film studio logo ever seen. I mean, the music is swelling, and then the Marvel Studios logo theme (thats a bit different) begins, and after it finishes, it starts up the awesomeness that is Guardians of the Galaxy.Now, onto the actors. First, Chris Pratt as Peter Quill a.k.a. Starlord. A big badass who has one of the best mixtapes I've ever heard and who is one of the most badass characters in the Marvel films. We also have Zoe Saldana playing a green woman named Gamora. And knowing Zoe Saldana, she's awesome in almost every role. And this one is no exception. She absolutely kills it as Gamora. Her fighting skills are awesome as always. Now, the next actor has to be one of the most muscled badasses in this film. His name is Dave Bautista a.k.a. Drax the Destroyer. He was a freaking badass fighter in this one! I know I keep saying badass, but there aren't anymore words to describe these characters. The final two characters I have to mention are also badass. First we have Groot. Voiced and sometimes played by Vin Diesel. He was really good as Groot, even though the only thing he could ever say was I Am Groot. And last but not least, I have to mention the badass that is Bradley Cooper as Rocket Racoon. Oh... my... god he was freaking awesome!! He had some witty one liners after every action. He was a very cocky character I must say. I'm serious, everything he says, he always has a witty remark to everything that goes on!The bad guy. Ronan the Accuser played by Lee Pace. People say that he wasn't as good as they hoped. But I gotta say, he was a massive menacing awesome villain. The backstory of Ronan includes him having a bit of a feud with Drax, because as heard in the trailer, Ronan killed Drax's family, and thus the feud was born. Drax, while focusing on being a Guardian of the Galaxy, has a major score to settle with Ronan. And for a fellow IMDBian smnam, I'm gonna talk about a certain character that goes by the name of The Collector. Played by Benicio Del Toro, he may only have about 1 or 2 scenes, but he is quite good in this. After his minor role in the end credits of THOR: The Dark World, in GotG, you see more of him and why he's called The Collector. He has a ton of stuff in his collection, including cosmonaut dog, and another item that is seen at the very end of the credits, I'm not gonna tell you. It's a surprise.Right, enough about the film before I give too much away, let's get onto the final score.The film was badass, director James Gunn did a fantastic job on bringing the B-Rate Avengers to life, the actors who played the Guardians were awesome, so I am giving this my biggest rating yet. Bigger than the rating I gave Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Godzilla and How To Train Your Dragon 2 combined. I am giving the badass of awesomeness film, a 1000/10!!!Telling you now, this year has been a badass year of film. We've had awesome films like The LEGO Movie, Godzilla, Maleficent, X-Men: Days of Future Past, 22 Jump Street, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, and now we have Guardians of the Galaxy. And it was awesome!!Hope you like my longest review I've ever written, I am Shane-O, and I approve this message.P.S. Stay for the end credits. You'll be in for the funniest and greatest end credit scenes in Marvel movie history. That's all I'm saying."
"Guardians of the Galaxy- Simply MarvellousYes it is a movie of cosmic proportions, an inter-planetary fantasy of epic scale. Yes it has a team of underdogs taking down a Goliath. Yes it has a talking raccoon and a tree as main characters. But what makes Guardians of the Galaxy the best Marvel movie of all times is the fact that it is the closest embodiment of the Marvel comic book ethos- full of wit and charm, spunk and fun, and of course, action.Sample this- somewhere in the universe, in a desolate planet with incessant water fountains, where a once proud culture reigned. A masked man lands in a spaceship, and charts out a path through the devastated surroundings. At one point, he puts on a Walkman, switches on Redbone's ""Come and Get Your Love"" and breaks into an impromptu jig. He is in some mood. On his way he encounters small dinosaur like creatures that he either footballs them or treats them as microphones, karoakaying his way and leaping across mortal dangers to steal an Infinity gem, as the credits start to roll. Marvel fans would be aware that the stone is one of the most powerful objects in the universe. This effortless boogey sets the tone for the movie- an irreverent take on universe shattering events.Unlike the Avengers, since the characters are all new, but even more bizarre, they do need a round of formal introductions-""Star-Lord, man, legendary outlaw. Forget it"" - Peter QuillPlayed in zany style by Chris Pratt, Peter Quill was kidnapped from earth when he was a child by a gang of bounty hunters. Today he is a galaxy trotting thief and space scavenger who likes to call himself Star-Lord. Tremendously attached to his mother's music, Quill is a Romeo who has survived in this cutthroat profession so far solely because of his improvising skills.""I am a warrior, an assassin. I don't dance"" - GomoraActed by Zoe Saldana (this time in a shade of green), Gomora is an adopted daughter of Thanos, surgically enhanced into a killing weapon. Gomora is exactly what she says, but learn to dance, she does, courtesy Star-Lord.""Nothing goes over my head! My reflexes are too fast, i would catch it""- Drax, the DestroyerPlayed by WWE star Dave Bautista, Drax is a naive to the point of stupidity, suicidal, tattooed mountain of a brute with a love for knifes matched only by his thirst for violence. He specifically seeks revenge on Thanos and Ronan, who he holds responsible for the death of his family. ""Ain't no thing like me, except me""- Rocket RaccoonCouldn't be more true. Rocket is like no other thing. Motion captured and voiced in scene stealing style by Bradley Cooper, Rocket is a genetically altered, cybernetic-ally enhanced raccoon with a thing for sarcasm. Happiest when with a big gun and Groot by his side, he is also a master tactician and the technical whiz kid in the team.""I am Groot"" - GrootPerhaps the most emotive role ever essayed by Vin Diesel- Groot is an ever growing humanoid plant whose vocabulary is limited to three words. Serves as the muscle for Raccoon with whom he has kind of a telepathic connection.Also in the mix are even zanier characters- Xondu (Michael Rooker), the bounty hunter that trained Quill and was later double crossed by him, carries an arrow that would have changed the course of the Mahabharata battle, the super-villain Thanos (Josh Brolin) who we will see more of in future Marvel productions, Lee Pace as the fearsome, maniacal Ronan the Accuser- a Kree warlord with blind hatred for Xandarians, and Benicio Del Toro as The Collector- an ancient alien. ""We are all standing, a bunch of idiots standing in a circle"" The Guardians are an anonymous, friendless lot. They have all been scorned and have suffered loss. Till they come together as a team to defend the planet of Xandar and its 12 billion people against Ronan, they have never known a family. The movie is a VFX extravaganza with superlatively detailed action sequences, but at the same time director James Gunn draws effectively from established scifi franchises such as Star Trek and Star Wars to create an emotional and expressive tale, while at the same time endowing it with oodles of self deprecating humor. The script is a belly full of laughs, the soundtrack is as it claims- awesome, and the acting by all, though caricatured, is top class. The end product is a an amazingly imaginative, visually stunning, frothy, lively, light hearted ""save the universe"" romp that wows with its dazzling visual style and at the same time keeps tickling your funny bone. Cannot recommend enough- 11/10"
"I've never seen so bad movie since ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"".... HOW?HOW can this movie has a rating above 8?? From the beginning of the movie till the end all you see is a mess! Childish plot, childish characters and awful, AWFUL humor ALL the times !! Even in the ""serious"" and ""important"" scenes there's always a stupid joke to ruin the moment(which is already ruined but anyway..). countless clichés and a story so bad that made me burn many many brain cells! The CGI where just OK and the fight scenes were at best indifferent..there were also some slo-mo scenes with nothing really to offer,i mean it's like a guy jumping in slow motion...seriously!nothing cool about it nothing new!Nothing about this movie is new or original! I have nothing else to say for this ""movie""..stay away!"
"If this is what passes for blockbuster entertainment these days then, after 50 years of cinema-going, I'm opting out for good. Are the filmmakers of the 21st Century so devoid of originality that everything has to be a cut and paste from the past? So, a brief run through of the tedium that passes for plot from that most dreaded of all auteur's the writer-director. A dude from the past (1988) gets taken into space sub-Hitchhiker Galaxy-style and gets to spout sub-Star Wars dialogue in a sub-Spaceballs kinda plot. I was looking at my watch after the first half hour. There was no irony or intelligence in the story, the hero takes off his space helmet in the vacuum of space and hands it over to the sour-faced flat-chested Star Trek reboot and they both survive! The director could have at least looked at Total Recall if the physics were too tough for him. If they can censor the best part of Zulu for alleged raaacism then I truly hope this garbage gets shredded for stupidity and cynicism. A sequel is, naturally, in the works. God bless you Stanley Kubrick."
"Such an awful wreck! There I said it. These marvel films are becoming a huge bore and nevertheless have disappointed anyone even bothering to consider that maybe one day Hollywood will create a stellar film. But this?! This!? Garbage? Filled, to-the-lid with CGI! The typical stereotypes blown over proportions and yet people still go to these theaters and pay for this crap and still LIE to themselves and honestly say that it was a ""fantastic"" and ""great"" and ""awesome"" A film that would put a psychologist laughing maniacally in their leather armchair. The ""Ten out of Ten"" reviews are being given out like candy from these people. Were the characters bad? Yes. How many? Out of the guardians, it's obvious out of the five, there's Groot, the tree humanoid incapable of having a conversation, but don't worry it can understand what you're saying until of course, the record of the Idiot starts to play and Groot marches off and ruins your pitch perfect plan. He's the cgi character crutch. Crutch? How exactly? Simple when there's a break in the scene, here comes Groot and then we say...""okay Groot, perform your thing and then maybe even add a homage to the Hulk?"" Rocket Raccoon, what a mess isn't he? Both as a character and the fact that most of the emotion in this film came from the animated Raccoon. How many scenes will star him seething at the audience? As if his problems are towards everyone? What's even worse is the fact everyone is laughing at him in real life, there's no respect for him outside the film. Oh, and where's his real accent? Though I would have to say he's not the character that ruined the movie, what a surprised. In the fight of Man versus CGI, cgi wins in having a character outperform it's humanoid actors. And what of Quill, Gamora, and Draxx? David Bautista as Draxx was actually the better of the three, in the overall performance (if any) Why? Well, you'll be sharing this characters maniacal laughter once you've realized you wasted valuable devotion for a franchise whose focus is better spent on a festival of explosions rather than a film focusing on Quality. Oh, but wait! Quill and his quirks and Gamora as the feminism object! Dun, Dun, Dun! The perfect trio nowadays are the idiots and the friendly brutes and the threatening but soft spot woman! Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana... WHAT COULD GO WRONG...oh I don't know... Let's start predicting before we start watching the film... Is there a sex scene? It's PG-13, so no, but is there a RomCom kiss scene? You BETCHA! Ah, what a romanticism of a film! Please let me just change my rating from 6 to ZEROIf you expect a disappointment, you're welcome. If you're an oblivious fanatic that just loves hearing and reading the same regurgitated lines, you're in for a whirlwind!Good Luck Marvel in your festival of delusion! May the farce be with you!"
"This film was like the story of "" The Emperor's New Clothes"", where the con artists create an invisible suit and just to fit in everyone in the village inducing the king say they like the suit. Parts of the film were enjoyable and the film BUT this film is not better than the 2001: A Space Odyssey, Bicycle Thief, Rashamon, Toy Story, Chinatown, Up, Pan's Labyrinth, The Hunt, Ikuru, Good Will Hunting, Blade Runner, Rebecca, Casino, V for Vendetta, Fargo, Trainspotting, Into the wild, Dial M for Murder, The Sixth Sense, The Thing, No Country for Old Men, Kill Bill: Vol. 1, Incendies, Network, Diabolique, There Will Be Blood, Amores Perros, The Wizard of Oz, Million Dollar Baby, The Avengers, he Bourne Ultimatum, Strangers on a Train, Twelve Monkeys, Notorious, The King's Speech, The Terminator, Rocky, Dog Day Afternoon, Monsters, Inc., Memories of Murder, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Die Hard, etc"
"We all had a pretty good idea on what this movies was going to deliver we had seen its trailer. The only question was how? Also there was a question if they are risking too much by suddenly introducing an all new MARVEL film, amidst of The Avengers franchise that was going on well. We also had our doubts if they are making things too complicated by connecting it to The Avengers in the future. Well, Guardians of the Galaxy manages to stick to your seats and keep faith in Marvel. Again.As the name suggests, this story is all about Galaxy and so many planets that you find it difficult to remember (Earth reference coming very rarely). As seen in the earlier reference of Thor the Dark World post credit scene, this movie is about one of those collectible objects(The Orb) that the collector is collecting. The fight for this leads to the meeting of Gamora (Saldana) and Peter Quill (Pratt) whom are joined by the bounty hunters Rocket (Bradley Cooper voicing one of the hilarious character of 2014) and Groot (Diesel). Then the story becomes more complicated with more people (or should I say Aliens?) wanting The Orb and their evil intentions. Drax The Destroyer (Bautista) joins the party and the all time quarrelling enemies become friends and call themselves of Guardians of the Galaxy. About the story I don't have to reveal many details here because there are so many other aspects in the movie which not only keep you on your toes but also has you in splits. A movie which is mostly dependent on CGI and green screen as there is hardly any part shot on earth has a tough ask on its hands to balance its main plot and also not confuse the audience with too many characters and planets/galaxies or any similar objects like that. At the beginning I thought things were getting a bit out of hand, but James Gunn manages to keep the humor afloat so that you don't complicate things too much. The characters are really well written and I think this movies going to be career changing feat for most of the actors. Chris Pratt looks like everyman's hero by playing quirky character as Peter Quill. Zoe Saldana is as sexier in green as she was in blue (Avatar). Though the Bradley Cooper's voice as Rocket is bit digitally modified it's one of the most intimidating character that you will ever see and more than half of the humor in the film is this character's contribution. Also, I salute the CGI team for bringing so many emotions into the Rocket character. You feel it's almost next to you. Vin Diesel as Groot doesn't have much to speak but the character is written very well. The surprise for me was Dave Bautista as Drax, I didn't expect much from him due to his WWE background, but he has performed equally well in both comic and emotional scenes. I expected more form Benicio Del Torro as Tanveer Tivan the collector but he has a little role here. There are other interesting characters played by Lee Pace (the main antagonist), John C Reilly, Karen Gillan and Glenn Close add to the strength of the cast. Creating a franchise movie with new characters and not so famous stars as protagonists is a challenging task. James Gunn has handled it really well. He doesn't bore the audience and also makes them feel involved as if the characters are already 2 or 3 movies old. A very special mention to the CGI and the Visual Effects team and also to every guy/girl who has made technical contribution to this movie. This movie is completely dependent on it. Yes, there will be a sequel and before ending this I quote Peter Quill from the movie, ""You said it, b*tch. We're the Guardians of the Galaxy""."
"For me the summary title is a good thing... I went to this movie with my brother (The comic book fan) as a non-comic book fan, thinking this will be another CGI-Bor-Fest, just like captain what's-his-face or the last iron man. Thankfully I was wrong within the first ten minutes, when the movie went from space-craft action straight into comedic fun, which set a precedence for intrigue-ness throughout the movie. It seemed to have this balance throughout the film, which I felt kind of related to other comic related movies like kick-ass. Just when you thought ""the movie couldn't be funny during this scene"", it goes and surprises you with a drunken escapade between the main cast. I Really do recommend to all stereotypes and especially those who sit on the fence with all marvel movies as I feel this may have broken the mould."
"Words cannot explain the thoughts I have on this movie. Unlike the new X-Men, I think the more you think about it, the more you like it, although both movies were equally good. Guardians has a good humor vibe throughout the movie with a compelling plot and an ultimately brilliant outcome of a movie. I may even see it again! I have read the comics before the movie was thought of and let me tell you, it was very true to the characters, and let me say, I had doubts about Vin Diesel's talent between Groot's small role in speech, but now I don't think anybody else could have matched how well he performed. Marvel can surely be at the top of greatness at the moment with it's movies, however I highly doubt that and I cannot wait for the next installment of superhero action brought to us by Marvel. Roll on Josh Brolin and his take on Thanos!"
"Warning for spoiler guys.I've never heard of this title before, neither read the comics and I was clueless about this when I watched the trailer. It looked like just some sort of space wars battling out like galaga and it was nothing special to me, until I went to the cinema and watched it. And after 2 hrs, I left the place totally mind blown and laughing and giggling with their lines, especially with ""I am Groot"" which I kept repeating with my nephew. Such fun times!The movie immediately caught my attention with it's opening. It was very emotional, really made me focus on the connection of the first character, and then just after the abduction here comes the most amazing intro of Marvel that is the most coolest intro in all of MCU movies. It moves towards Peter Quill now dancing and singing and it was like that moment is so fun that if I had this movie on DVD, I'd watch that dance a hundred times together with that song of Red Bone! The following scenarios would be epic and I must say the scene in the prison where they all met together is the best place for them to meet. It felt so cool that all 5 of them would work together on a similar cause despite them having different principles and perspective on their own.From then on everything was just interesting and fun. It never subsides and all of the characters were fun, emotional, interesting and enjoyable to watch. The plot and story is so amazingly cool to hook me up and there was no boring part, all pure action, laugh, awesomeness and touching scenes. Rocket, Groot and Drax are the most fun characters in the movie, especially Groot and Peter Quill winning the funniest acts that made the whole audience in that place laughed for like 15 seconds straight and clapped their hands in pure majestic resounding loudness.Rocket and Groot are one amazing tandem. I never recognized Bradley Cooper's voice actually. Their lines were epic and it digs deep into my mind. This movie is the only movie to establish and rig those movie lines inside my mind without forgetting them. They've kept on repeating inside my mind like I just won the lottery with magic numbers. The CGI of these 2 characters is flawless and just fit the mood of the whole movie.Peter Quill, Gamora and Drax really brought it up to top notch with their insane acting skills. Chris Pratt nailed the character and I felt that amusement again when I first watched Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man. He's now a movie blockbuster superstar I guarantee it, together with Zoe and Dave. Dave being one of the most funniest wrestler turned actor I've ever seen. He hooked the audiences with his line that ""Nothing goes over his head"", epic, just Epic.From start to finish this movie grabbed my butt rock steady on my seat with amusement and amazement. Definitely the best movie of Marvel in par with Avengers. Congratulations to the new stars of this movie, Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel and to the wonderful works of Director James Gunn and company, thank you for this memorable and amazing movie of the decade!"
"I seem to be the only one that found this movie to childish, i think that it was a real big shame that they tried to make the movie so that children were allowed to watch it. For example, not a single human dies during the movie, Starlord just uses his electric shock thing when he fires at humans. And the movie was to ""un-serious"", there were jokes every minute which made it impossible to watch the movie at the cinema because everyone just laughed like hell when there was a small joke that actually wasn't funny at all, well some jokes were a little funny but none of them made me laugh. I may sound like a horrible person for doing this but the only time i laughed was at the beginning of the movie when (SPOILER ALERT) starlord's mom was lying sick in the hospital, me and my friend started laughing uncontrollably and i don't even know why. I guess that we started laughing because we knew that you aren't supposed to laugh to those things. Everyone stared at us... Anyways the movie also had lots of predictibale moments and some parts of it was a little clichè, (POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT) and the end battle that they made you look forward to was the most anti climax end to a movie i have ever seen, they killed the main villain so quick. Overall the effects and animated things in the movie were extremely good, the setting was good, the jokes were al little entertaining but there were way too many jokes in the movie and there was a lack of death and gore, the the movie was way too short and the characters didn't have time to develop, and the plot was way to predictable and cliché. You didn't see any blood or gore during the movie at all which made the movie way to comedic. I would prefer the movie to be more serious and ""grown up"". I would give it 6/10 but that is for people over 11 y.o, for a child this movie would be perfect, from the perspective of a child i would have given it 9.5/10. And if they had made it less childish i would switch the scores so that it was 9.5/10 for people over 11 and 6/10 for children. I hope that the sequel will be more grown up. (The sequel's plot is also very predictable, if you have seen the first one you will know exactly what will happen in the second one.)"
"Before i went to this movie, i saw the review's of others, and my expectations went a bit up, i thought man really need to see this movie, if its as half as good as everyone else says, but ti totally was not. I was laughing at some jokes, but overall was 5% of the jokes funny.The film didn't even felt exciting, by the characters, full with stupid jokes and arrogance, made me not feel up for them, it didn't felt like they would ""not make it"" and then ""oh they made it"" feeling and , like (containing spoiler) at the end, was really surprised how they won Ronan, i mean he started to dance, and sing, and after turned out to not be a human but a half human, half alien who could hold that stone, that end was just so cut off, and so surprising stupid. it didn't felt like action movie, shooting and effects does not give you action, action you get from the feeling you felt for the main characters, and i did not, and this new arrogant, cocky jokes, just stupid, like new spiderman, ruined just like that. And the emotions, man rally, felt like every body is soft, then they are arrogant, and then again stupid, and it rally didn't felt like a comedy, it didn't felt like action, and it didn't felt like drama (i don't know what this film is)."
"I went into this movie'with high hopes. I'd seen positive reviews and heard it favourably compared with Serenity - a particularly favourite of mine. I left the cinema bored and irritated. This film was so derivative, frankly I'm surprised that anyone gave it more than 5 stars. Opening scene? Indiana Jones and the lost Ark. Badies? A leather clad Darth Vader with runny mascara. Emperor? Check. Secret about the father? Check.People have said that they felt the characters were fleshed out.. Are you out of your minds? ""I lost my mother"". ""Really? I lost my wife and child"" ""That's nothing. I was cut up and put back together so many times AND I was bullied"". ""Well I used to be a shrub and was transplanted without permission"". The special affects were massive and continuous and - in the end dulled the senses. There was the inevitable Ninja babe and cutesy furry character. No one meaningful died apart from Darth who got fried in blue fire.. why he didn't just grab on and share the magic I don't know. Lastly there was no sense of tension. We all knew that the goodies were going to survive. There's a sequel to make right? I could go on and on but I won't. I went to see this in hope. I won't be seeing the next one unless Joss Whedon is put in charge. Sigh another wasted two hours of my life."
"Watched this today at the iMAX Manchester. I love watching movies at the cinema, and have felt slightly cheated on a few recent movies that disappointed and appeared to be more of a cash cow: Taken 2 springs to mind, but there are others. The premise to this film excited me, as did the cast involved: a Marvel movie with a raccoon, a tree-shaping humanoid and adorable bodyguard, the amazing Chris Pratt (watch it and be enchanted/amazed by his stellar performance), Vin Diesel as 'Groot' who you will *love* by the end (trust me) and the surprisingly excellent David Bautista, whose comic delivery is sublime. The action is well throttled and not OTT. The perfection lies between the tangible chemistry between the main players and the razor sharp comedic script - it just works, trust me. The icing on the cake is the soundtrack throughout, it was well judged and impeccable. We all left the cinema dabbing tears of laughter from one of the final 'Groot' scenes. Honestly, this movie ticked all the boxes and more - best movie ever."
"So - my son and I went to watch GotG. After reading mixed reviews we were skeptical but curious. The bad reviews unfortunately were right. The movie has no story line, stupid characters (like a talking raccoon) and more bad language than most rated R films I have seen. The producers were trying to cover the lack of plot with senseless action scenes that all seemed random and disconnected. Do yourself a favor and save the money you spend - you will get more pleasure from a big cup of ice cream. I can't believe Glenn Close and Vin Diesel took even small roles in this.My sons' quote: "" I totally agree with my dad. There was no point in making this movie. The movie is overly dramatic for instance; in the beginning of the movie Starlords mom dies from cancer and she asked him to hold her hand while she dies, and he looks away and cries. Then after she dies he runs out of the hospital and gets kidnapped by aliens. The characters are really badly made, like the evil blue dude who has a half robot daughter that just stands around him like an eavesdropping servant or the madman who just tries to kill Ronan - so a lot of this movie is stupid. We left the theater half way through."
"Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the least known comic books of Marvel. The only reason why the whole world, aside of the fans of the source material, are going to see this because it's a Marvel production, but we should all admit that apart from the comic geek world, nobody knew who Rocket Racoon and Groot were before the film was announced, nobody heard of Starlord before Chris Pratt was attached to the project, and most people hardly knew what it is actually about. While many are still seeking for a Doctor Strange or an Ant-Man movie, we should first get to know something that haven't got enough attention before. And wondrously, these filmmakers introduce this mythology with huge love not only to its own, but also to the fantasy/adventure genre and its old classic form, which easily delivers the sheer fun. But even in the realm of explosions and zany worlds, the best parts of the journey ended up being the scenes with the characters interacting and often to engage a set of great humor and drama. That is already too much to ask for a ridiculously fun blockbuster.It is certainly a space adventure, it already offers a lot of strange alien designs and intergalactic action, but the big stuff aren't the only highlight of the movie. The film would mostly focus on its characters, nearly all of them may be aliens, but their pathos and personalities are down-to-earth. How the team was formed is the same way how The Avengers did. They aren't nice to each other, but they had to get along so they may save the world... or galaxy. But here their motivations are either for revenge or money instead of heroic pride. How they introduced themselves may be a little too over explained through their conversations. The exposition is so relied on the dialogue, but what keeps it from being exhausting is when those talks lead to a naturally clever punchline. The film is just best when the heroes are developing their sudden friendship, turning themselves from cold hearted thugs into a likable band of misfits. The film also has a big love for the seventies music, and it smartly uses it for Peter Quill's last earthly thing he'll ever possess in his otherworldly life.These parts with the characters make the action the secondary appeal of the film, but that doesn't always mean it's a bad thing. This is basically going back to the past blockbusters when rooting for the characters was more important than trying to advance the technical/style abilities. But then, it doesn't have any problem with the action, except sometimes the space battles can be hard to follow but again whenever there's a humor in it, the consistency goes back on track. It's simple fun, sometimes nostalgic piece of adventure that doesn't have to be over-serious to be outright compelling, but it also does have some drama, while it doesn't entirely embraces its sadness, it at least gives some hints behind the characters and manifests the heart and brutality of their backstories eventually. The actors are excellent indeed as they give plenty of shining and charismatic personalities to their awesome characters.The plot may not be too sharp or its villains may not be so memorable, but Guardians of the Galaxy still reaches its goal of lovingly introduces its universe to the ones who've never heard of it. Since everyone is aware that superhero movies are made for the mass more than its fans (let's have to be honest about this), this idea may not always be taken seriously, especially when comic book movies have gone to its dark and gritty era and yet this one offers us stuff like a talking tree and a gunslinging raccoon, but here it is: Guardians of the Galaxy, the movie that isn't meant to exist ending up being one of the greatest films that Marvel ever produced since Iron Man. Is it a bold choice for them? Probably, but it's really not hard having self-awareness. The triumph of the film is reliving the classic, somewhat campy space opera and marking its characters as its real deal, even when they are not as familiar as many of Marvel's heroes. In the end, it's just pure fun, the flaws are there but at some point it doesn't matter. Every moment of the film has the excitement and laugh that anyone would seek for a blockbuster, taking place in a fascinating new world that we are yet to fully explore."
"I love good superhero films, Captain America, Superman, Iron Man. This is not one of them. If I""d been alone I would have walked out and the last time I did that in a cinema was for The Wedding Singer.It's not without merit but with $170 million spent, I would hope not. The design overall is very good, the effects also and unlike some I liked Chris Pratt and the Ronan actor. But the attempted humour in the dialog is supremely irritating and the racoon character's grating voice was enough on its own to make me hate the talking scenes.The film is so derivative it could have been assembled by cut and paste. But at least it does not take itself seriously, we are thankful for small mercies.Enough said, I will go out of my way to avoid James Gunn films in future."
"Typical over-hyped, overrated blockbuster movie. The movie tried to be funny and serious at the same time, sadly it failed at both. I'll make it very simple.Story premise? Cheap emotional scene with an undeveloped character that i couldn't relate to. Four characters get together without any build up for them, rather it feels because the plot demands it. Character development doesn't exist. Story is very simple: good guys vs bad guys. (enjoyable for kids) Story isn't plausible, especially at the prison, it doesn't make any sense how each character behaves, and how the prison authority handles it is cringe-worthy. Also it's full of plot convenience and scenes which insults the intelligence. Filled with one dimensional characters, this movie has no depth at all, it is just mindless entertainment and the problem here is that it is generic, i have seen it many times before, so this kind of entertainment is outdated and i'm annoyed at how Hollywood is over- using this. Villains are as usual stupid and the good guys are underdogs who win and repeat jokes after each dangerous situation, such original WOW (sarcasm). Soundtrack is very bad. Visuals were great and had some innovative stuff.Guardians of the Galaxy is the typical blockbuster movie we get each year which only relies on good visuals and some mindless action.4 points out of 10 only for the visuals."
"Went to see this in the cinema after the good reviews from IMDb and my friends, some of whom went to see it twice. What a disappointment. It didn't appeal on any level. It was a complete pile of Groot! Humour was limited and shallow, plot gossamer thin and the action was not really worth the effort on the whole. It's not as if I took the film seriously either. I really enjoyed the ludicrous Lucy, despite its numerous flaws. Surely I can't be the only one who didn't like this film? If it had been directed by Uwe Boll it couldn't have been much worse. If I never see it again I will be OK. Glad I didn't waste more time and money watching it in an IMAX. A 12 inch portable black and white would suffice."
"First, don't blow up if you disagree with this review, but I was rather disappointed in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"". Like, I would guess everyone of you, I was very much looking forward to see this movie.However, within mere minutes, this film felt like a ""B"" movie with an ""A"" level budget (search all of the ""B"" Sci-Fi and Fantasy films that were released in the 70's and 80's!). The only difference was the money that was clearly put into this movie (the dialog, while many, I'm sure, had a good laugh, was cheesy to me, with pop culture reference jokes that just don't belong in a Fantasy film!).During the course of the movie, I kept being reminded of the ""Star Wars"" films -- and not the latter three! Yes, much of the film seemed to borrow from ""A Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack of the Cones"". But, worse, over and over, I was getting deja vu of... wait for it... ""Flash Gordon""! Yes, a great, but very much ""B"" movie, from the 80's, that, thanks to the recent hit, ""Ted"", made a return to our pop culture radar. The final battle, didn't make me chuckle, but groan with it's similarity to the final battle in ""Flash Gordon."" If you loved this movie, great. Everyone has their own tastes. I'm just warning those who haven't viewed ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", and are considering going to see it because of all the money it's made. Wait until it comes out on DVD."
"Lots of eye candy which I hadn't seen before, but not very convincing behavior of the characters, and with a really disappointing ending: would any bad ass really be so easily distracted by somebody moving so silly in front of him that he stops making his final sway? No way.The music was disappointing. The incidental music as such is good, but the 70's music they used doesn't fit the movie. Only people who are prone to nostalgia, will like it. But even most of the people who remember the songs from the days they were hits, won't really like it, because the songs generally don't fit the scenes. It also shows that most of these songs are already completely forgotten.Yes, I know I will get a ton of reactions by people who claim they remember the songs. But, hey, there are billions of people on earth, even a few hundred who react here telling me the songs did ring a loud bell, don't convince me."
"When I saw the trailer, I didn't think this film would be anything special. A few weeks later, a friend of mine who shared the same opinion at first, told me it was ""awesome"" after watching it. Since then, I held my expectations high, but I was greatly disappointed. To be honest, I don't even know where to start. The film is a huge cliché overall and a ridiculous mess. Starting with the characters and the actors that give them life, we have great names in the industry, which of course, grants the film some status. Still, my only thought about this was ""What the hell are you guys doing in this film!? Seriously!?"". Renowned actors mixed with bad acting and pseudo-funny acting, which doesn't turn out to be funny, isn't exactly the perfect recipe. I don't dislike Zoe Saldana but the roles she takes are more or less the same and she doesn't even bother to work on different mannerisms or whatsoever to create an interesting performance, to provide her character some individuality. Most of the plot holes (if not all of them) are found in the main characters, whose ambitions change like the wind and without making any sense. One minute, Gamora was trying to kill Peter Quill, and five minutes later Quill was saving her... because he's that good. Just like they are best friends forever after that. The love interest feels so, so forced (because plot!). Thankfully, we don't get to see them kissing or whatever, otherwise that would be a bigger face palm. The background stories are boring, with no consistence, and so cliché; there's nothing new about them. In Gamora's case, we step onto Mary- Sue's grounds; the usual wannabe badass, who's actually just a damaged girl who suffered a lot in the past. Not to speak about stupid lines which you wouldn't even see in films Oh, and of course, talking about footloose and a lizard fight, to extend the length of the film.I couldn't feel any empathy or whatsoever for these characters, so that means they are doing it wrong The sentimental scenes meant nothing and I couldn't care less if they died. Actually, scratch that; if they died, I could have left the cinema earlier.Everything is a huge cliché (frames, scenes, characters). It almost feels like you're watching a collage and you know EXACTLY what's going to happen every SINGLE time. This film doesn't surprise you in any way. The soundtrack was terribly chosen. It gives the impression that they just chose a couple of songs they like and said ""let's use it"" even though it doesn't fit. Moreover, and if I'm right, it's not supposed to fit. It's supposed to contrast with the scenes, to make it funny. It wasn't. That's where it gets ridiculous...If this film is supposed to be a parody, it's not funny at all. If it's supposed to be taken seriously, it fails miserably. It did manage to make me and my friend laugh in the final scenes at the absurdity of it all.Not everything is that bad though. Truth be said, the film has excellent special effects and that is the only reason I'm giving it two stars. I'm pretty sure most people get stunned with the effects and think it's great. Rocket was somehow nice and Groot was the one I sympathized more with, even though he said the same line over and over.For me, a film has to tell a story, even if doesn't follow convention. At the very least, it has to express something like every kind of art. I'm tired of going to the cinema and watching the same plot over and over without any consistence, of watching films that are 90% explosions, cities being destroyed and so on, and 10% plot. I just felt dumber after watching this. It's called mass stupidification."
"To start, Chris Pratt did an excellent job with this film: he is the only detail of this production that carried my attention (oops sorry I didn't know how this machine worked--middle finger joke). At a length of 2 hours, I found myself stretching, and uncomfortably shifting in my seat, because I did not feel captivated by the trash before my eyes. Too much flashy CGI, and not enough character, intelligent dialogue, or a story worth watching.The story adds another chapter to the Marvel universe, as it seems every Marvel film is all tied in to a greater over-arching story, dealing with infinity stones, and control over the universe. These films created by Marvel, and now especially this film, Guardians, are nothing more than over budgeted daytime drama, like Days of Our Lives, Bold And The Beautiful, etc. The scripts of these daytime serials seem to carry the same story for years straight, and so do the scripts for the Marvel serials. Guardians of the Galaxy could easily have an hour edited from its run-time and placed on Saturday Morning TV as a made for television movie for children. My 6.5 year old son loved this film. My wife (who enjoys Marvels Avengers) fell asleep in the theater, and I found myself enjoying watching my son laugh, only, hoping for this film to end.To Marvels credit, the Thor films are incredibly entertaining, but are almost ruined by the lead character Thor.So, the only reason to see Guardians of the Galaxy, is to watch children laugh, because this is the level of comedic and script writing talent that exists for this trash for cinema."
"So, according to this film's IMDb rating, it's better than Aliens, Apocalypse Now, Ben Hur, Back to the Future, Heat and 2001: A Space Odyssey. The list, I'm sure, goes on. Now, this film was not without charm, but I think people owe this a little more thought. I had no expectation other than to get baked and see some vapid 3D spectacle and, in that respect, this film definitely delivered. However, had it not been for the cushy recliners in the VIP theater and the fact that my friend drove, I may very well have left somewhere in the giant head part (and I sat through Anger Management). The comedy was so contrived, they might as well have thrown in a ""don't go there"" and a ""talk to the hand."" A motion picture treatment of Robert McKee's ""Story"" would've been less formulaic than this rubbish. The millenarian reactionary in me revels in society's departure from cultural excellence, recognizing this development as an unmistakable sign of our collapse, but the rest of me is scared and confused."
"A lot of articles have been written about just how many comic-book hero movies there are in the market and planned for the coming years; they talk about viewer fatigue and market saturation and other such terms. They perhaps have a point but it is hard to really pay it much mind when the genre produces films which are fun and entertaining. With its massive success and the fact that it comes with association to already successful franchises, Guardians of the Galaxy perhaps looks like an easy film, but I do wonder how much people were taking a risk when they greenlit a sci-fi film based on an pretty much unknown comic book series, with a lot of things that could potentially have been really silly; seeing Howard the Duck in here is also a reminder of how something that is quite cool in theory can fail to connect to the audience. What makes it work though is that it is really light fun, easy to get lost in because you are laughing or smiling for the majority of it. It is at its best when the main characters are allowed to do their thing, with the best laughs coming from the banter between them (who would have thought that wrestler Bautista would have such great comic timing). The silliness is kept at bay by how tightly funny it is; it is sharp, daft, cool and engaging. The actors do well, with Pratt being charming fun, Saldana being more than just a figure, Cooper having a lot of presence with his voice, Bautista getting lots of laughs with his straight delivery, while Vin Diesel (who must have wondering if they were making fun of him with this casting) produces one of the most lovable characters with only a few lines of dialogue.While the cast have good timing, it should also be said that the film does too – for example cutting away briefly during an action sequence for one line to get a good laugh. The film unfortunately is not quite as strong when it has more serious or narrative driven moments. The opening of the film is a good example of this, but it is just as relevant during more intense moments or serious 'franchise' moments, because it still needs to be a film. The mix just about works, and the laughs, fun and cool silliness carry it across moments where it has none of this.It is not a work of art, and it is not as remarkable or brilliant as some would have you believe, but it is still very entertaining. In a genre filled with action-packed but overly serious films, or films that are just silly in a bad way, it is quite refreshing to be able to watch such a film, laugh all the way through it and come out having enjoyed it a lot for how well it balances, judges and delivers the humor consistently."
"I was very excited to see this movie. I love sci-fi and super hero movies and considering the glut of them out there, this one was sure to top them all. The good thing is that this movie does not require you to know anything about the back story, the characters, or even what the heck you're getting into other than it's a sci-fi super hero fantasy world. It reminded me of a Firefly meets Indiana Jones combination.The problem I ran into is that it was quite formulaic, quite a bit predictable and overall tried a bit too hard to be funny at times. I'm a big sci-fi geek and am able to suspend disbelief for the sake of entertainment but the character makeup made them look, well, made up, like I was watching a play as opposed to a feature film. Maybe the fidelity of films are getting so high that it's difficult to mask the makeup, but it just seemed like too much of a distraction to me.In no way am I saying this movie is bad. It's very good. Just not great. Maybe if I was fan of the characters I would have enjoyed it more, but overall I couldn't see it as the smash hit 10/10 everyone is giving it."
"James Gunn is the guy to keep an eye on. His work on Super was already pretty good, but what he did with Guardians of the Galaxy was amazing. Sure it's not a Shakespearean drama, but still, he found the sweet spot between visual effects, action, humor, drama and capturing the source material. For me it was a highly entertaining movie that's almost on par with the Avengers. If they had made the transition between rag tag team to a united group a bit better and they had found a way to avoid the usual cheesiness then I would have given it a 10 and called it genius and the best Marvel movie yet. For now it's a close 2nd. The best part of it was that it didn't take itself too seriously, used an unconventional music score and went down the comedy road where Pratt, Coopers voice and Groots animation really excelled. Also kudos to James for getting quite a few of his usual actors into the movie - especially Nathan Fillion, his brother Sean, Rooker, Seth Green (Kevin Bacon wasn't far away either) - the cameos they had were quite enjoyable. Bottom line: if you liked previous Marvel movies then the chance is high that you're going to love this one."
"I am struggling to understand why fans found this movie so good. Perhaps it's just recent yet and, in time, people will figure out their mistake.Let's face it, the plot is ridiculous, working around a music themed heroic saga through the galaxy, when the songs themselves are either plain bad or do not represent quite well the moment. Plot problems will also go by too many characters presented in a way that seems like we've seen them before but we don't really remember where from, well maybe another movie, like The Collector, Nova Prime or Korath. And many, many clichés.But the worse part for me was the cheesy dialogs and the absolutely ridiculous jokes. I couldn't laugh even once and I do tend to have a good sense of humor. The joke about slipping the finger on your neck - really?! And Rocket demanding a man's artificial leg for nothing, to say later that that was a joke - absolutely unnecessary. On top of its nonsense, the final scene: Ronan is about to finally get his revenge, has the power to do so, is about to do so, then, at the very last moment, he stops to watch Quill dancing (while others prepare to blast him). Oh, forget the fulfilling of my greatest desire, the one driving my whole life and existence, let's just stop and watch him dance... seriously? Was that supposed to be funny? Am I a ten-year-old boy watching Woodpecker? 2 min of thinking would have sufficed to come up with a not so childish way to do that scene. What a great plot indeed. Maybe I could be going too hard on a film supposed to just entertain, with lights and sound, but it bothers me how stupid they think we are when they treat us like children.One very good side though that saved this movie from total awfulness is the beautiful CGI images, not all, but many, specially those from space and star wars-like spaceship battles.Every single other Marvel movie was better than this - and not all were exactly good. If the sequence is going to be as good as the first one, please don't even start it, Marvel.And, not to forget, some one has to tell Nasa that, to prevent people from dying from a spacecraft falling down on earth, you just need to make a sphere shield made out of entangled branches and leaves... awesome!"
"Mindless entertainment usually has some charm to it if nothing else, Guardians delivers none of that. Throughout the whole film it provided maybe two sincerely funny moments while the rest of it came across mostly as unintentional comedy thanks to a gibberish script. I've never laughed at someone dying of cancer before but the prologue of Guardians is just so hilariously god-awful it had me in stitches all through the opening credits.Oh Christ, what a forgettable, uninteresting and pitifully bland mess of a film this was. I suppose it appeals to easily impressionable simpletons but I struggle to see how, there's hardly any character development, the plot is nonsense from start to finish, the antagonist is some bland and boring caricature who seemingly only exists as a vehicle to introduce Thanos (who is a big deal I'm assuming?) and it's all just so damn predictable. Perhaps worst of all the ending is just another anticlimactic retread of the old and tired ""power of love"" trope.I may have given Guardians at least one point if it had decent effects and camera work put into it, but none of that is to be found here."
"... are either ...1. getting bribed by the producers 2. friends or relatives of the producers 3. incredibly gullible and without any real points of reference as to what constitutes a good movie.The current IMDb of 8.1 is a huge insult to every great film out there.SPOILER: This film, with it's flat lifeless acting, non-plot, and terrible childish 'humour' will SPOIL YOUR BRAIN CELLS.DO NOT WATCH ... YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!P.S. this is a gratuitous line of text to enable me to reach the IMDb required 10 lines....... oh dear, looks like I need to add a few more gratuitous words because I still haven't driveled on enough..... are we there yet?okay ... we're done here!"
"I was so excited to watch the movie because everyone hyped it up so much, but was extremely disappointed by the first hour of watching. I was expecting something more out of it and I wholeheartedly believe the rating misrepresents the movie. It is definitely overrated and over hyped. The narrative is too set up, I feel like the story was written around the purpose of having the 4 characters together. It is boring to watch as the audience already knows what is going to happen half way through. The love story is so cliché I just can't. I'm pretty sure this is a crappy review but I can't concentrate on one thought as I'm half way through the movie right now. I love Marvel Movies but this one just killed me, I'm so bored I don't even want to finish it. Definitely DO NOT RECOMMEND watching."
"visually this movie was amazing. The little raccoon guy and groot looked very real and i laughed a few times. It was interesting for the movie score they used of all these 1970s-ish funk tunes when the guy put his Walkman on.BUT............We get a ""Star"" studded cast of C and D list actors/actresses oh and Vin diesel we're in for a treat he should go back to racing cars in the fast and the furious franchise. Sure Tom Cruise or someone every drooling idiot knows has to be in a movie to be good. BUT It's too long the story is the same old crap year after year as if we're renting our movie tickets. Seriously why not be the bad guy and destroy a galaxy or two and watch him slaughter a bunch of people and focus on that.I wouldn't give this movie past a 4 star. It doesn't deserve the current 8.9 though. 5 is watchable and if it wasn't for who I went with I would have walked out. I barely watch TV so this is an honest without any brainwashing hype review."
"Man oh Man, this movie was terrible, how this got an 8.6 is beyond me, and in fact that's what I went based off of and luckily never really go to movies now days because of all the crappy movies Hollywood pumps out.There is nothing to this movie, I went with a friend and I literally kept falling asleep every now and then looking at my watch hoping it will be over. Its just an empty movie, all action with no story nothing, just some shooting here and there and stupid jokes.All recent movies like this including the new Amazing Spiderman 2 are just terrible movies with nothing to them, Hollywood is just a cash cow now and this is why I refuse to pay for movies in theatres."
"I saw this movie the other day, and I liked it...it was pretty fun, but as I walked out I said to myself, ""why is this SO popular?"" I don't think this would be even a quarter as popular as it is if it were not a Marvel movie. I think people see the Marvel logo and rush to see it. I have good friends that saw it that don't like science fiction at all. It was a good movie but it's wasn't that great...I personally thought Gamora was awful, while Drax was surprisingly really great!What do I base my opinion on that this is only big because it's Marvel? Serenity/Firefly....almost the same thing, yet Serenity didn't make hardly anything. I wish movies could be judged based on their stand alone quality, and not just people that live and die by Marvel. I did enjoy the darker side of the movie, it didn't feel like the typical Marvel movie which can get kind of tiring with all the puns, and kiddy humor. Did anyone else feel the same? Just ask themselves why this is doing AS well as it is? I am a DC girl, but I enjoy both. My favorite is Superman, and my second favorite is Captain America"
"There are times in life where you have to wonder about humanity. This is one of those times. Guardians of the Galaxy, at one time was THE all time highest rated movie on IMDb. Yes, right up there and above The GodFather and Shawshank Redemption. There are reviewers who titled their reviews with ""Amazing,"" or ""Visually Stunning,"" and many ""The best action movie of all time."" Look, maybe to you it is the best ""action"" movie of all time, but that doesn't mean you give it a 10/10 and make it THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME! Seriously?! Lets just start by saying that a large portion of today's audience must get bored quickly... Because Guardians is one battle/fight scene after another. The only time there is not a battle/fight scene is when Hollywood feels forced to try and make a love story, like they do far too often. Only this one is with a guy falling in love with a girl (alien girl, that is) that had tried to kill him several times in (you got it) a fight scene 10 minutes earlier. Ugh! There were many attempts at laughs in the movie, and the audience responded, mostly, but they were predictable and corny. There were times I was waiting to see Mel Brooks walk out and say it was a sequel to Space Balls.Oh, the fight scenes. Yes, they were non-stop, which a young audience will enjoy. But watch the movie a little closer and you'll see why I was so over the fighting. Nothing but low-light, non-stop camera angle changes and shaky. That's the way you make things look more action packed. Just shake the camera, change the angle every half second and turn down the light (Oh, a few fire balls or explosions in the background help). You watch the fighting and have no idea who is doing the hitting and who's getting hit. So frustrating and migraine triggering.I could go on and on, but fortunately some people have come on here and reviewed the movie properly, which moved it quickly down the list of best movies ever. I'm not saying it is a horrible movie, it's not. It's entertaining and has great special effects (but that's what all action movies are today, effects and no story). Young adults will love it and if you are a seasoned movie buff you'll like it but want more. Take it for what it is, a action movie with no real story and non-stop fighting with some comedy. 5/10!"
"No story spoilers, just a quick message to you that you must watch this movie.I watched the trailers so many times i have lost count. Really had high expectations and they really delivered, Guardians of the Galaxy is the best Marvel film yet. If you liked Avengers, you will like this even more. So happy this movie came.3D is not usually my choice of spending money, but this was totally worth it. This movie is just made for Imax, with 3D as a desert. The acting is superb from the main characters, soundtrack, editing and cinematography are also excellent. This is the type of movie that makes you beg for the sequel. I am probably going to watch it 2 or 3 more times. I wont say anything about story or the characters, just go and be surprised how the movie sucks you in its awesome world."
"I must be missing a gene or something as I found very little to enjoy here. Perhaps this is a question of personal taste, however I believe in playing it straight when it comes to fantasy-there's just a lack of realness to any of this. No attempts are made to justify/ground any aspect of the world or characters we're seeing.I disliked the general visual direction and oddball tone personally. Everything felt like surface detail, an unbelievable world akin to a Bucky O' Hare cartoon. The villain disappears off the page too. A few funny moments here and there, but I'm fairly sure I'm down a few brain cells after seeing this utter dreck. Outside of the Avengers and possibly Captain America 3, I fear it's all downhill from here with Marvel movies."
"You know that feeling, when you for example taste a good quality product and it for sure should be awesome, but it lacks something. That is precisely how I feel about this movie. You have awesome effects, great camera angles and from time to time a joke that can get a chuckle or two. Although, this humor is not my cup of tee, but I can understand why people can get behind it. But there is an inconsistent world, shallow villain, undeveloped characters, plot full of Clichés, etc. So why do I even bother? It is after all, a movie for a younger audience so one should not expect a masterly portrayed characters and thought-provoking plot. The thing is, that the overwhelming majority of todays cinema is consumed by this kind of filmmaking. But again, this is easily understandable. People want to run from the real world into fake one, where rules does not apply and everything turns good at the end. Have we become mentally weak, that we can't handle the movie that is more serious than a cartoon? The audience won't ever visit the cinemas after they shed a tear there or had themselves pondering over movie they just saw? Than again, it is a comic book movie and it does the job. It just feels that every movie today is some sort of a comic book movie."
"I had more or less low expectations for this film, but after being semi-forced to watch the whole thing (social obligations), I was met with the unfortunate end of ""Low"".The film had some interesting and novel ideas to play around with (a bandit raccoon and a walking tree? Perfect!), but the word that constantly came to mind while making it through to the end was ""Overdone"". Too much action (yes, I said it), paper-thin characters, a plot that made absolutely no sense at all, and weak attempts at humor - the combination of all these left me checking the time every few minutes waiting for the all-too-predictable ending to be over.Oh, and a constant irritation (at least to me), was the ""soundtrack"" -- songs from the 70's which grated on my nerves. I guess they were trying to be ""original"", or something.Simplify the plot, develop the characters a bit more, work up some *good* actions (not just random explosions and bits moving about) and there might have been something here to hold my interest. Unfortunately I'm not a teenage boy who might think all this overkill is a-w-e-s-o-m-e, but I was bored within 30 minutes.Sorry - I wanted to like it, but it didn't happen."
"The First paragraph of this review consists of exposition. If a potential reader wishes to read about my opinion on the movie, skipping to the second paragraph is advisable. It's been about two years since I saw this movie at the cinema - something is compelled me to organize my thoughts and write this now. Why? I'm not entirely sure, I guess ""Guardians Of The Galaxy"" was always kind of an enigma to me. How could a movie so inept in everything it tries to do be so praised? It's not your typical Michael Bay-esque Hollywood cookie-cutter garbage, so It's success can't be attributed to following the same, overused, cliché-infested formulas. It could be that I am insane in my own specific way, but outside of production value I found no redeeming qualities here. I know the movie is an adaptation (of sorts) of a comic book series. My knowledge of comics is incredibly limited, so I'm judging this thing on it's own merits.""Guardians Of The Galaxy"" reminded me of one of those sci-fi stories I would come up with when I was 10-13 years old. It was a favorite pastime of mine, coming up with characters, who were blatant rip-offs of others from franchises I enjoyed at the time, putting them in nonsensical situations (of course, to 12 year old me it all made perfect sense) and just admiring my creation as any narcissistic child would. Of course, my stories didn't have movie adaptations with astronomical budgets.I compared ""Guardians Of The Galaxy"" to a child's sci-fi story because of it's complete lack of direction - too many plot lines (more akin to plot doodles) that are individually unrefined and irrelevant to the overall story, which somehow manages to be even more undefinable. It's like a space opera chopped up and stitched together in some horribly messed up jigsaw puzzle. Now, some movies thrive on a lack of continuity and direction (Tarantino practically mastered that form of film-making), but this specimen is different. Again, it's as if the script was written by a child and the whole thing was directed by some individual who somehow had the skill of a top-notch director, but again possessed the mindset of a 12 year old.What's even more surreal about the whole thing is that it feels incredibly solid - it's not ""The Room"" where every seen is irrelevant, because of the writer/director's sheer incompetence. Somehow, ""Guardians..."" holds itself together quite well, again everything else is top notch: Excellent CGI, detailed land/spacescapes (albeit of unoriginal, uninspired design) and pretty good acting with some minor exceptions. As I said before, this movie doesn't play out like a typical Hollywood schlockfest would - there are too many plot lines and too much time is devoted to character development - if this was typical garbage, we would have had a lot more action scenes and female characters in suggestive positions. All these attempts at complexity feel sincere, again, it's like a child trying to do his best, but they have no purpose. To illustrate: why should it matter that the green chick and the blue chick (sorry, too lazy to look up names) are sisters - it could matter, but the movie makes no attempt to give some importance to this statement, they share some scenes, the talk about about each other, they fight, but nothing really comes out of it. It's the same with every single plot point you can think of. The Villain? Well, he's pale blue and angry and he has this massive spaceship fortress and wants to rule/destroy (not sure) the universe, but wait it turns out he's not the main villain, there's another guy and he's even...yeah a 12 year old might buy into this being legit character development, but I've grown far too old and cynical.In the end, ""Guardians Of The Galaxy"" feels like it starts from nowhere, goes nowhere and accomplishes nothing. A very empty, yet confusing (albeit visually spectacular) experience. But all the glitter in the world can't make this shine. Sorry."
"Disappointing would be a massive understatement for this turkey. Chris Pratt falls flat in his attempt at movie stardom. It takes more than hiring a personal trainer to be an A-lister & this guy lacks the ""It Factor"". The lame one liner jokes are relentlessly fired off, all of which fail to hit the mark. The CGI is heavy handed and distracting, this film is the cinematic equivalent of Kim Kardashian: desperate for attention, and utterly empty on the inside. Setting this epic lack of substance to the hits of yesteryear only highlights how desperate the Marvel hacks are to conjure up some sort of hipster factor. Sadly, Zoe Saldana (in green face) is wasted as the token female character in this excruciating hot dog fest. This ""movie"" will only satisfy the most simplistic of audience members: those who mistake product placement for entertainment. If all you are seeking is an empty shell of film featuring a truck load of hideous special effects, you will no doubt be pleased."
"Honestly, I watched this in the first place because of the high ratings. I was expecting a lot more from it and was disappointed after I watched it. The graphics is great, the animation looks surreal but the movie itself couldn't keep me interested the whole time. I was actually just forcing myself to watch it during the middle part of the movie. It gets kind of interesting as it ends and that's the only part I enjoyed the most. I think it was dragged during the first part and middle part that's why I got bored watching it. I didn't find it humorous at all. Actually, I didn't feel any particular heavy emotion when I was watching the move, except from the part when groot died. So yeah, I'll give this movie a 6 just because of the amazing graphics and because of groot's death."
"okay guys i gave this movie the lowest score possible. for good reason.so the movie is a revamp of the guardians franchise. some horrible American actor plays a human who was abducted and raised by space pirates that teams together with one of the worst female actors to date . her character is essentially a ninja wicked west of the west. let not forget to mention the other 3 main characters. a tree a raccoon and a meat head. who team up to defeat the strongest entity in the universe + a back and forward treasure hunt. the acting is crap. the story line is so obvious, within minutes of starting even the feeble minded could predict the outcome. As for the title ""guardians of the galaxy"" i would like to comment that while there is a lot of space flight. they only save one planet. sort of.i am so glad i downloaded a cam version of this movie and didn't waste a cent. i would like to say a big EFF you to whomever picked the cast. to this point marvel has had amazing casts. iron man, Thor , captain America? this movie taints marvel. in their pursuit of profit. they have created another flopDO NOT BOTHER WATCHING THIS MOVIE."
"Honestly, I thought this movie was one of the most overrated movies of 2014. All you hear is how ""perfect"" it is, and how it's ""Marvel's best."" If what you desire is a mediocre, silly science fiction film, this is well-worth your money. While this movie may have heart, and great special effects, it is simply not enough to compensate for it's unnatural, forced comedic script, and it's ""Look how unique I am"" aura. The story alone would only suffice as decent at best. Yes, it is extremely unique in the realm of Marvel production, but Marvel was never geared toward humor as it was geared toward compelling adventure and dramatic turmoil. Nearly every joke in this movie only distracts the audience from a potentially praise- worthy quality. Frankly, this film is too silly to take seriously. Its only redeeming factors are its special effects and it's undeniably aberrant features. This is simply not Marvel's best."
"I went to see Guardians of the Galaxy as I had to see for myself what the big fuss about this movie was. I'm not a comic book fan and do not have any background idea about the characters before, however super hero movies are one of my favorite genres to watch. Let's start with the positives: - Chris Pratt was amazing in the lead role: charismatic, funny, and a joy to watch. - Amazing music and soundtrack during and after the film. - Good CGI Now for the negatives: - Not much of a story and zero character development. You have the feeling that the characters just want to be friends and they come off as needy. - Too much action is happening all around that it becomes a mess, similar to the transformers movies. - The villain Ronan is so boring and predictable. They need a great villain like Loki from Thor. - Drax and Gamora are disappointments in the film. They don't seem like a big deal and Drax sends most of the time getting his ass kicked instead of being a destroyer.Overall I give the movie a 6 over 10. Don't expect too much and just enjoy the ride. It's watchable but definitely not as good as the reviews you will see on this site."
"I watched this movie for one main reason: it was a Marvel production. Marvel has been hitting home run after home run so I figured that this movie would be no different. Well, it was.Guardians of the Galaxy was very foreign to me. Unlike most of Marvel's previous releases, I knew nothing about this comic or its characters. And with comic book movies being so epic nowadays this movie had some hard acts to follow.The Guardians of the Galaxy are five anti-heroes that have been thrown together and are working to a common goal for different reasons. Each member is different in just about every way imaginable, they're not even all the same species. Starlord (Chris Pratt) is a mouthy arrogant human. The name, that he gave himself, says it all. Groot (Vin Diesel) is a tree that can grow its parts at will. Gamora (Zoe Saldana) is Kree (I believe) and has been raised to be a killing machine. Rocket (Bradley Cooper) is a loud mouth raccoon with a penchant for guns. Drax (Dave Bautista) is a muscular something. They were a team in which the whole is greater than the sum of its parts because neither of them alone could accomplish much alone. The different characters were not superheroey enough nor intriguing enough for me.That's probably where I feel the movie fell short. I was mildly interested in the characters (Rocket more than the rest) and I was mildly interested in the story. The action and special effects were on par with today's standards, as they should have been, but the rest of the movie was rather flat. Simply put, the movie didn't draw me in."
"There are people out there who can write a half decent script, and don't get the opportunity to ever have it heard. There are people out there who have serious acting skill and never get seen. There are sci-fi movies that have an original story that don't have a budget to be released at their full potential. Support people with talent and original ideas. Do not see Guardians of the Galaxy as it contains nothing that vaguely resembles any of those things. Congratulations on nailing the CGI though guys, that was great. If I felt like staring at great CGI for two and a half hours though, I'd play Call Of Duty."
"As the movie started I was excited to see a character wearing a mask with glowing red eyes. I thought the opening scene was promising and then suddenly some non-serious music started to play, the main character started to dance and everything went downhill from there. After that there was special effect after special effect. I love special effects, but it did sound like this movie was made ""only"" to showcase special effects such as explosions, explosions, explosions and did I forget to say explosions? The special effects were indeed magnificent, but it doesn't take long for you to realize it is all eye candy. It is there to help conceal the fact that this is a movie made for ten year old kids to gaze at and go wow. For everyone else, and by everyone else I mean adults with thinking brains, this extremely shallow and childish piece of work would be little more than a showcasing of special effects and cinematic techniques. Surprise, surprise, special effects do not make up for a shallow, childish, and extremely disjointed plot with performances that range from mediocre to downright terrible and they do not make a movie worth a mature person's time. I loved the Ghost Rider, Thor, and the Amazing Spider-Man 2. Even The Avengers was tolerable, but this one was simply a mess. Designing lots of weird looking characters with unpleasant colors and hair styles is like desperately asking the audience to love the movie just because it has some of the most weird looking characters ever seen in a movie (Men in Black anyone?). One of my biggest complaints and what really annoyed me throughout the movie is that while the special effects were great, the combination of colors in most of the scenes was really unpleasant. Remember how Thor had great colors in each and every scene? The colors actually went with one another. You don't see that here. A combination of light blue, orange, brown, grey and a lot of colors that create a really awful combination was present in nearly every scene. It was a huge letdown. Next time they should get a better art director so that they do not annoy the people who understand colors and art. In summary, this movie is not for adults. Take your kids to see it though. They will definitely love it, but since spending so much money only to entertain kids is not really justifiable, They'd better stop wasting such huge amounts of money on movies like this and spend it where it's really needed. Fighting Ebola to save the human race would be a much better use of such a huge amount of money."
"Guardians of the Galaxy is unoriginal, insubstantial and most significantly, it's not funny. Once touted as their riskiest film to date, it is artistically and politically as conservative a film as Marvel Studios has ever made. The disappointment of the space adventure is that it is little more than a retread of a pedestrian formula, the numbingly predictable scaffolding of the comic book and superhero genre, hidden under the disguise of a broad comedy. The film's jokey banter, self-referential tone and pop culture references are smoke and mirrors used strategically to distract us from what is a threadbare narrative of unimaginative climaxes. When the film pauses briefly between action sequences lifted from Star Wars and the digital imagery of video games like Mass Effect it is to pursue an ideological viewpoint that doesn't inspire or rewrite the blockbuster but merely redecorates it. The film's values for family and nostalgia are not to be mistaken for depth or thematic goals but compulsory staples of Marvel's production line, the intention of which is to preserve the genre's wide commercial appeal while drastically limiting the variety of what mainstream Hollywood chooses to explore. The film is an adaptation of Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning's comic book with James Gunn directing and co-writing the script with Nicole Perlman. It opens in 1988 with a young boy named Peter Quill listening to a cassette tape in a hospital. His father is absent and his mother is on her deathbed. Under insanely melodramatic circumstances, she passes away right before he can take her hand. After he steps outside the hospital he is abducted by an alien spaceship. The film is extremely vague about what happened next and what his reaction was to being taken away as a child. Instead, the story forwards twenty-six years later to when Peter (played by Chris Pratt) is now a trained smuggler and explorer of alien worlds. He is also still carrying the same cassette player with him, allowing him to play many of the film's retro tunes. Peter stumbles upon a magical orb of power, which he learns is too dangerous for him to sell. It is wanted by a powerful samurai-like villain named Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace). Also in pursuit of the orb are a number of different misfits including an alien named Gamora (Zoe Saldana), a fast-talking, aggressive raccoon aptly named Rocket Raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) and his anthropomorphic tree friend Groot (the voice of Vin Diesel) and a muscular warrior named Drax (Dave Bautista). Each of these characters has different reasons for wanting the orb or for stopping their enemy Ronan as they become the guardians and protectors of this space world. What Guardians extracts from this plot is not to parody the superhero genre like Gunn's previous film Super but to continue Hollywood's two most formulaic and overused ideological goals: individualism and the restoration of the family unit. Although the guardians are touted as being misfits and losers this is not a character study. The guardians are more like action figurines, distinguished by their bizarre appearances, catch phrases and one-liners, while their suit gadgets and weapons become a cliché expression of how individual talents can save the world. Initially setting the film in the 1980s is also crucial to understanding Marvel's ideological complacency. This time period means that much of the film is encompassed in Reaganesque values, who in his terms in office stressed the importance of sustaining the American family. The guardians reflect this ideology because a number of them are tormented by comic book clichés like avenging their families who died at Ronan's hand. Dead parents syndrome is abound. Similarly, the guardians become integral in resolving Peter's desire for a new family, which is climaxed by possibly the most unintentionally Freudian moment in a superhero film. An extended hand from one character to Peter recalls memories of his mother. But Peter Quill's transformation from a womanising man-child, into a more caring, selfless family man, is not a change at all. His arc is merely synonymous with Hollywood's narrow and formulaic ideological aims about the goodness found in people when conforming to Western and Christian values like the family unit. The reason Marvel has employed an immobile, nostalgic lead character is because they want the adult audience to have a synonymous emotional reaction. As they are unwilling to change the formula of these films, the studio risks losing its adult audience as they grow older. As such, everything here is geared towards the past and makes no promises for future directions of this genre. The director and his writer know this because in a deliberate move to make adults comfortable with being adolescent again they resort to including ""mature"" references and jokes about The Maltese Falcon, Jackson Pollock and a soundtrack comprised of hit tunes from the 1970s. In the end these are superficial additions, aimed to nudge the nostalgic ribs of the adult audience and to deter us from how dreary this action-comedy formula has become. The narrative in Guardians is terribly slight, running out of steam before the end and padded extensively with tension-free set pieces where characters are rarely hurt. Much of the exposition involving the film's forgettable villains is confusing and rushed, especially for people like myself who haven't read the comics. It is also unfathomable that after this many films in Marvel's universe they are still relying on something as derivative as a MacGuffin device to rigidly string action sequences together. The most telling moment throughout the whole film though is at the story's apex, when Peter confronts one of his enemies and says that he is distracting him. It is a moment of Meta fiction because comedic elements like this are simply papering over what has become formulaic and all too predictable from Marvel."
"To start with, the film has excellent visual effects and the action sequences were very good. The production design kind of looked like the 60s, but that's not really a problem. I felt like there was nothing really new here, the same story-lines are repeated in these Marvel films, so it does not have a lot to make it unique or so different from other Sci-Fi films, and it is really strange to me how so many people loved it. Also, apart from Groot (who was just awesome), I did not find any of the other characters very likable, especially Chris Pratt. Zoe Saldana was the clichéd bad-ass action heroine who is more serious than the goofy male hero.However, the story was gripping a lot of the time, and I have to repeat how amazing the visual effects were; it was just visually dazzling. But I also had a problem with how bad the skin makeup looked on the colorful characters (Zoe Saldana, her sister, the villain and others). All in all, the film was fun to watch and has great visuals, but I found it overrated."
