"I was a fan of the ""V for Vendetta"" graphic novel, and Alan Moore disinheriting the film was a bit discouraging. But he's always been a little crazy. The film version is everything I could have possibly hoped for - gripping, chilling, intense, exciting, heartbreaking. It gets Moore's music if not his exact words; elements are slightly different, subplots removed. But the idea - as V himself would be so proud to say - remains the same.The plot is surprisingly complex and nuanced, and I don't want to give anything more away than the previews already have. Suffice it to say that a masked anarchist (voiced by Hugo Weaving) must save a young woman (Natalie Portman) during his attempt to expose corruption in the government. Weaving is perfectly cast, using his formidable physicality and imposing voice to give gravitas to the insanity of the character. Portman has gone from child to teen star and is finally emerging as a talented, adult actress following her Oscar-nominated turn in ""Closer"". Here, she gives her best performance to date as the orphan Evey. John Hurt is characteristically impressive as the enigmatic government leader, and Stephen Rea gives a wonderful supporting turn as the police inspector charged with finding V - before it's too late.The Wachowski Brothers' former protégé, James McTiegue, takes on the directing duties here and helms an enormously impressive first feature, using every trick in the book in a manner reminiscent of his mentors' breakout hit ""The Matrix"". Unlike ""The Matrix"", McTiegue allows the story to be more of a focus than the action, and as a result the film is a tense and emotional thriller, with outbursts of spectacularly filmed and choreographed action. Showing more maturity and restraint than the Wachowskis, McTiegue doesn't show off, and his trickery isn't self conscious. When slow-motion overtakes a late action sequence, it seems as natural as breathing. The late cinematographer Adrian Biddle (the film is dedicated to his memory) does an outstanding job, Oscar-nominated Dario Marianelli's score is a fantastic accompaniment to the piece, and the visual effects are astonishing, terrifying, and deeply moving, especially in the climatic moments in Trafalgar Square.With solid acting, great action, and fantastic technical wizardry, it sounds just like another ""Matrix""-style ripoff. But the biggest difference in ""V"" is that it is a story of real ideas - not a fantastic, science fiction creation, but a genuine examination of the human condition. The power of fear takes center stage here - the fear of war, of disease, of famine. Fear is a basic human nature, and has been exploited as a weapon - a method of control - for centuries. And for those who would use it, a masked man waits in the shadows to carry out your sentence. The verdict? Vengeance. ""V for Vendetta"" is a must-see.10/10"
"I am speechless. I just came back from the theatre, where I watched 'V for Vendetta'. There are three main elements in the movie and it excels on all three of them.First off the dialogues and script. Intense, witty, honest but not patronising, intelligent but not pretentious. That's the first level at which the movie surprises you. You don't except such high level of script from an action movie. But it is slowly revealed to the audience that V for Vendetta is not just an action movie. The story is filled with current events and has a definite strong political sense.Secondly Hugo Weaving's performance. It is definitely what grabs you from the start. He delivers some of the hardest lines with incredible charisma. His performance shines throughout the movie and honestly he sounds as good as any of the best actors out there. He should be nominated for an academy award.Finally the visual part. Incredible, yet no ""Matrix"" effects used. Everything looks beautiful, dark yet vibrant. The cinematography is top notch. The final battle scene brought tears to my eyes.Do not miss 'V for Vendetta'. It's one of the best movies of all time, an eternal classic.10/10"
"V for Vendetta is still after all these years one of my favorite movies to watch, and I find it as relevant today as it was whenever it was released in 2005. It is a story about a freedom fighter whose goal is to take down a totalitarian government that uses fear and deceit to control its people. To do this, he knows that one man is not enough to accomplish such a monumental feat and that he will need to use something that cant be silenced, hurt, or killed. he sets out with the goal of planting the idea of revolution in the people because, as he says in the movie ""Ideas are bulletproof."" 
One of my favorite things about this movie is that the main character is wearing a solid mask. It is a fantastic display of acting, both voices acting as well as physical. I guess you could say that I found myself not liking the character as much as I loved the idea of the character. The writers and director did an amazing job of drawing me into the storyline by mirroring enough of the world we live in today that I felt that the world I was watching on the screen could very easily enough being the world I live in one day. I saw myself in many of the characters and identified with their blind devotion to their country, their developing distrust of their government, and their inner conflict of trying to rationalize the two. 
Hugo Weaving plays the leading role of V and delivers and an unbelievable performance from behind a mask. Natalie Portman plays the role of V's sidekick, love, and accomplice. Stephen Rea plays the detective that is hell-bent on finding out the truth even if that means he must accept that all his life he has been on the wrong side. Many other great actors help director James McTeigue bring The Wachowski Brothers V for Vendetta to life. It is definitely worth your time. Please watch and enjoy this movie,"
"""Remember, remember, the fifth of November, gunpowder treason and plot. I see no reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot."" I've never read the graphic novel, but I don't think you need to read it to appreciate the movie. I saw the film last night at it's World Premiere at the Berlin International Film festival. Though it became a little weighty in the middle (one part seemed to drag a little) other than that it was a great experience. The story was so topical that I got seriously emotional during a lot of parts. Weaving did an excellent job with the mysterious title character ""V"", creating a poetic, intelligent, and compassionate yet ruthless character. Portman always seems to surprise me, except with her Star Wars character. She portrays tremendous emotional range and transforms completely throughout the movie. This is one of those movies that really sticks in your head long after you watch it though... and it continues to stir and grow."
"There are some that will, upon seeing this film, say that it was akin to Andrew Lloyd Weber attempting to make a political statement: overly dramatic. These people would be well served to remember that the symbol of drama is a mask, which certainly begs one important question- Why, if you are so put off by an overtly dramatic motion picture, would you choose to see a movie that stars as the (anti)hero a man in a mask? I just saw this film at an advanced screening and I must say it is nothing short of uniquely brilliant. Entertaining from the start, V manages to combine a strong socio-political message in a compact and highly intense experience. Infused with issues and concepts that pervade in the global political climate of our times, this movie is endowed with a tremendous timely relevance that belies its trappings as a mere action adventure.The acting, the cinematography, the effects, and the general vision of this film all lead me to believe that it will likely receive a cult following. It is only my hope that the message of this film will come to summarize the history of our future ascendancy to true liberty.Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country. In the meantime, go see this movie."
"On the eve of the suppression of freedoms following 9/11 and the government spying and intrusions this was just the film we needed.
Over ten years later it is still exciting and riveting.
Whether seen as entertainment or a polemic against right-wingers: V is a hero."
"...I am well aware that my summary line invites several retorts, and given the nature of my comment those retorts may very well be resoundingly, unanimously negative. If I say ""This is one of the Best films I have ever seen..."" One would think the immediate response would be, ""Then you must not have seen many films in your time, dear boy."" Butoh I have, and it has been far too long since there has been something up on that screen in the darkened theater that I enter to leave this boring, monotonous existence that had the capacity to inspire. To see the possibilities of what might be, what could never be, and what could happen if the leaders of the world keep things going in the directions that they are headed. V For Vendetta is just a film, yes? But it is also a wake up call of which there are not enough in this time we live in. It speaks directly to the hardship that we endure but seldom take notice of because we are distracted by things that do not matter...upon leaving the theater I saw people, teenagers mostly, the very people who should be pro-actively questioning the methodical erosion of this thing called government in the modern age, react with complete apathy. Most try so hard to be so outwardly different from the rest that they do not realize that in doing this they become just like everyone else; oblivious. We as a society do not want to see films like this, we do not want to acknowledge the atrocities going on in the world, all we want to do is play our video games, watch reality television, spend our money on clothes, jewelry, entertainment. Things that for all intents and purposes we do not need. These are the distractions that keep society from pondering in the wee hours of the night what they can do to prevent true injustice. The evils committed by those that govern are far worse than any fiction the cinema can dazzle us with these days. Yes this is a truly great film and one that I will cherish for a long time. I can only hope that its message finds a wide audience that is open to seeing things from another perspective, in a uniquely human light. In the end that is what the film is about...being human. Having the capacity to choose weather or not to recognize the evils of society and take a stand to make things better than they are. The film of course takes this idea to extremes but for the viewing public dramatic examples are needed to awake them from this artificially induced state of being we call existence and say, ""I see there is wrong, and it is my duty as a human being to do what I can to make it right."" To the makers of this unique and wonderful film, I salute you."
"It's been quite a few years since I first saw V for Vendetta. I didn't see it at release, because I was far under the age demographic at that time, but I managed to catch up to the film at around 2011-2012. Not sure the exact year, but I was a teenager at the time, and I loved the Matrix (still do), and heard that V for Vendetta was written by the Wachowskis, so I thought I'd give it a shot.It blew me away in many ways, and I credit the film as being part of the reason I became less homophobic and bigoted in many ways. It was the first time I saw homosexuality in a direct and positive light in the media, and it helped me immensely in establishing my more left-leaning views in the Christian world I was raised in.It's for this reason I have a very deep and personal relationship with this film, but I love the film at a more enjoyable level as well. This film oozes with style. Everything from the cinematography and sound design, to the ways characters speak and act. The rather sparse use of fight scenes (in comparison to other action films of its ilk), opting rather to use political thriller tropes and character development, surprised me the first time I watched it, but even though the film wasn't as action packed as films like The Matrix or Equilibrium (both of which have massive third act spectacles) the action I feel is much more effective and emotional than either of those films (ironic, since Equilibrium is about emotion). While short, the final fight scene between V and Creedy's men is an incredible burst of ecstatic visceral action that makes the entire film worth it.You can say there are three main characters in this film. There's V, the titular anarchist vigilante, Evey, the young woman who is kidnapped, and slowly falls for V in a more violent twist of Beauty and the Beast, and there's Detective Finch, a government employee tasked to finding and unmasking V, and during this task discovering that his beloved government isn't as noble as it may seem. Each of these characters is given a fair and due amount of screen time, and they each have a full and satisfactory character arc. I find how well written and edited this film is to be incredibly impressive, and writing this I want to watch the film all over again just to appreciate it more.There is something to be said, however, about the differences between the film and the original graphic novel written by Alan Moore. I haven't read the original comic, but judging by Alan Moore's distaste of films inspired by his work, and the fact that he refused to watch the film after reading the script, maybe this film isn't for fans of the original work. There's a great comparison video by CineFix on Youtube comparing the film to the novel, and they are very very different from each other. One notable difference is that the portrayal of V vs the dictator Sutler is much more nuanced and less Black and white in the novel than in the film, and that is a very well deserved critique of the film. I do not claim that V for Vendetta is the best film ever made. I haven't even scraped the surface of world cinema and cinema history to ever make that claim. However I can definitely say that V for Vendetta is, at least for the time being, the most personally meaningful movie, and the most enjoyable movie, I have ever seen. Mad Max Fury Road did get close though."
"'V for Vendetta' will no doubt be remembered as being one of the most well-produced films of this decade for its powerful script, strong character depictions and the sheer excellence in terms of quality. Loosely based on the DC Comic, the film is set in a totalitarian Britain where the BNP-like government who run the country with an iron fist that they make Thatcher's Tories look positively warm and trustworthy. Then emerges a vigilante in the form of V, a man deformed by fire and the governmental experiments that have given him enhanced strength, who is determined to free the UK from dictatorship by blowing up the Houses of Parliament. Evey is the young woman who is unwittingly embroiled in his plot and soon understands what just it is that motivates V so.The acting in 'V for Vendetta' was top-notch and, along with the well-written script and apt soundtrack, gave the film the essence to engage the audience and make them feel-- for better or worse-- for these characters. Although her accent was wobbly in places, Natalie Portman delivered a strong performance as Evey, depicting the character's growing love for V and the realisation that the time for her to fight has arrived. Stephen Rea also deserves a mention, as the detective who begins to grasp just how corrupt the government he has supported really is, as does Stephen Fry who proves he can do much more than play bumbling characters in his performance as Deitrich, a protester who hasn't quite grasped just how far the government will go to shut their opponents up. John Hurt's Chancellor Sutler was very terrifying as the dictator who couldn't give a toss about his people so long as he remained in total power. However, above all, it was Hugo Weaving's absolutely brilliant depiction of the lead character V who dominates. Without ever seeing his facial expression, he exudes the pragmatism, charisma and intelligence of the character with a twist of revenge-driven madness.Entertainment-wise, the film doesn't fail with it's apt soundtrack and well choreographed fight scenes that do remind you that this was based on a comic book. Yet 'V for Vendetta' maintains the ability to leave the audience shaken and chilled at the thought of how easily a Western country can be ensnared by tyranny when a corrupt government is allowed too much power and goes too far. The elements dealt with are all the more disturbing with the state of the world today. I imagine it will touch a deeper cord with Britons like myself (it would have been interesting to see more on how Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland had fared in this new world though) as it is so rare that a Hollywood film is set in the UK. It's always simpler to pretend these things could never happen here so it is a sharp shock to see such a dark future located in familiar surroundings of home.I highly recommend this film to all as it will leave you both entertained and pondering matters raised in the storyline long after the credits have rolled up."
"Amazing acting, visceral action, great special FX, and faithful yet creatively interpretive of the graphic novel."
"I saw this movie yes today here in Denmark, and i didn't know what to  expect, because i haven't heard of the V or read the Comics from  publisher DC comics.  But was i in for a BIG treat, this movie is so superbly acted by all  the actors, especially Natalie Portman performed according to me to an  Oscar nomination next year.  The movie is perfectly put together, so if you haven't read the comics  you will be on the edge of you seat the whole movie. Its really that  good folks.  And lastly, the visual effects is fantastic, and the action scenes is  nothing but spectacular.  Watch this movie :-)."
"V for Vendetta rating: 3.5 out of 4V for Vendetta is a swift and smugly entertaining portrait of revolution. Albeit, this is a Wachowski Brothers revolution, meaning there must be wildly theatric heroes and crisply tailored CGI stunts all set comfortably in an oppressive Totalitarian society. But this is more than The Matrix with a Victorian flare. V for Vendetta offers up a convincing vision of the near-future paired with an operatic comic book tale of love, mystery, and a Guy-Fawkes-masked rebellion. Our hero is V (Hugo Weaving), a masked terrorist with a mind for the subversive, a taste for the eloquent, and a hand for knife-wielding acrobatics. His accidental apprentice (or maybe hostage) is Evey (Natalie Portman), a young woman V saved from the fondling grasps of corrupt Fingermen (kind of the CIA for the V for Vendetta world) as she hurried across town past curfew. Our oppressor in this world is High Chancellor Stutler (John Hurt), whose persona is shown primarily through a five-story tall projection of his ever-angry head. The exposition for this near-future lies mostly in the implosion of America after the middle-eastern war expanded into a world war that reached its tendrils even through Western Europe. America folded into civil strife while Britain became the final bastion of modern civilization after a biological attack isolated the island into a zone of quarantine. Stutler rose to power in the chaos and now rules Britain with the mantra ""England Prevails!"" Rest assured, however, this is not a reality governed by rolling robots and giant overhead blimps; it's a world that's, instead, very similar to ours. The technological innovations are hidden subtly into the film's environment, refusing to take precedent over the historically opulent flavors of England's architecture. V for Vendetta has a flare for the theatric and operatic, after all. There's no room for bleeping robots and bounding technology. On the eve of November 5th, when Britain traditionally celebrated freedom and truth, V launches a subversive plot to topple High Chancellor Stutler and his surrounding administration. Hijacking the British Television Network, he broadcasts a speech that sets the date one year from November 5th as the date of the revolution. Our story takes place in the interim year leading up to the supposed revolution, with the evolution of Evey's politics, the ongoing vendetta V has set against the players of a mysterious government plot, and the deepening hole V digs for Stutler and his boys to stumble into once that fateful date arrives. ""Remember, remember the fifth of November."" What separates V's rebellion from the teeming hordes of other cinematic coupe d'etats made over the years is that V for Vendetta approaches the topic with one eye held straight at the politics of the present. Hot button headline topics continually rear their heads here. Bush is paralleled to Stutler, the news media is heavily clouded, our hero is paired with images of suicide bombers and subway attacks; not to mention the undeniable fact that we are asked to sympathize with an outright terrorist. Is terrorism justified when paired against a strict oppressor? In the political climate of today--where the title of terrorism is threatening to mirror the clout McCarthy granted the title of Communism--V for Vendetta's answer to that question is a sure-handed yes. But V for Vendetta is no heavy-handed political allegory. At its heart, V for Vendetta is entertainment. And as any entertainment with a hand in Victorian elegance, V for Vendetta must have romance. But before you conjure images of the Fawkes mask flying in a sweaty bald-headed scene of lust, realize first that there also is a master-grasshopper dynamic between Evey and V. The romance is formed as an understatement and rarely addressed, let to simmer below the surface and lend more chemistry to scenes that would otherwise ring hollow.Natalie Portman may have stolen the tabloid exposure with her shiny shaved head, but Hugo Weaving is the masked performance that steals the show. Much of the role's success lies in the writing, for V is made not to be simply a mask. There's a theme throughout the film asking whether behind masks of revolution, there lie fighting men and women, or only their ideals. V answers this question with charisma. Contradicting the common mantra that masked figures must be laconic, V, in fact, probably has the most lines of all. The character is full and rich with quirks and personality, but still exists with that essential air of mystery. Weaving achieves the same level of iconic performance that he did with Agent Smith in The Matrix. It really is that good.There's been debate over the quality of adaptation the Wachowski Brothers offered to Alan Moore's original graphic novel. Moore has publicly separated himself from the film, quoting in the New York Times last week that ""the screenplay's rubbish."" Well, before we all walk away from the ticket line, remember primly that Alan Moore will be the first to tell you himself that he is a selfish, pretentious prick. He knows it, and we know it. Let's move on. The screenplay's fine. In fact, it's a near-masterpiece. What the Wachowski Brothers have done is find the right balance between the theatrics of the graphic novel, and the solemnity to the richly Victorian narrative. They form a dynamic that plays to both sides, allowing for a story that sparks both political debate and giddy entertainment. We'll first shake our heads at the sentimental, soft-focus flashbacks and silly sub-plot for ""nuclear human experimentation""; but when mulled over, we realize it's just the comic book mentality showing its spots. After all, V wouldn't start all his sentences with v-words had this film shunned its comic roots. And anyway, V for Vendetta is a vividly vivacious and voluptuous volley of a very violently fun time."
"This marks the fantastic return of the Wachowski brothers.Those who were disappointed with their last two efforts will not be disappointed here,there is no doubt that the Brothers are talented.Here they make their comeback.But not as filmmakers,but as producers and writers.And to be honest ,this film thrills you from beginning to end.You'll be blown away with this adrenaline excitement and dramatically intense thriller.A finely complex storyline about V, a reluctant freedom fighter , a rebellion who fights for freedom against the government in London in another time line.Set against the futuristic landscape of totalitarian Britain,a mild-mannered young woman named Evey who is rescued from a life-and-death situation by""V."" Incomparably charismatic and ferociously skilled in the art of combat and deception, V urges his fellow citizens to rise up against tyranny and oppression. As Evey uncovers the truth about V's mysterious background, she also discovers the truth about herself--and emerges as his unlikely ally in the culmination of his plot to bring freedom and justice back to a society fraught with cruelty and corruption.This is perhaps the first and fully realized and most successful of all the Moore adaptations.What I liked about this film was the way it balances action and drama.The script is fantastic and directing is equally worth a mention.The assistant director on the Matrix(James McTeigue) movies really has some talent ,and handles the action and drama very well.The film is fast paced and exciting.It is also politically charged and quite controversial but that is the point.It makes you think about the current situation, how well is the government handling the situation of terrorism.V serves as an anti-hero on a quest of freedom.His actions are right but his methods are wrong,he is trying to bring about a message in the wrong way.This film focuses on the source material of the book, more on the characters than on the action.More on the emotions and the drama than on the violence.This film doesn't glorify V as a terrorist but shows that under certain circumstances he was tempted to be what he is.The film has an intriguing atmosphere throughout,never once boring,an apocalyptic future setting really heightens the tension with starkly dark set designing and stunning cinematography.The action is striking and the performances in the drama are standout.This is a terrific movie at all points, it has a strong script , impressive directing and commendable performances.But having read the book after the movie,I must confess this film is still nowhere close to being better than the book.No way.It feels incomplete adaptation,leaving a lot of details behind,whereas the book had a more in depth look at V's life and his relationship with Evey.But I guess the filmmakers wanted to take a different approach,to which they succeed completely.There is a reference or close resemblance to Guatanamo prison and 9/11 issues echoes throughout the film.And it made the film even more direct.There are several more references to our world dominated by politics and government,regarding terrorism.And what they do to secure their safety.This is one thing that makes V so controversial.His actions will make you think he's insane,but it's just an idea,a notion that alerts us to take actions if our own Government ever try to control us,and inflict fear into our lives. Hidden behind the creepy mask ,Hugo Weaving really proves he is a versatile actor.His character provokes thoughtful questions in a dystopian future ,and every emotion of his character is brought out by Weavings performance.Portman on the other hand also excels,with a convincing accent.She really is the heroine of the film and she handles the role quite well.The scenes between Evey and V are touching and well handled.The rest of the film is superb in its execution.V is an idea,a symbol,a metaphor that cannot be destroyed.A man can be obliterated but as an idea,an icon he is indestructible and his message becomes more powerful to convey as people look upon this figure ,but not the man beneath it.One man can make a huge difference but united men and women can change something.And that's what made me respond to this film's ideas.It's full of it.Shed with technical and visual brilliance.A spellbinding adventure , exciting action, superb directing and writing and a Sci-Fi film with a thoughtful message,and the first fully satisfying Moore adaptation.This film is the most controversial and at the same time breathtaking Action/thriller.A terrific achievement produced by the Wachowskis' and Silver.The climax,especially,was uplifting and beautifully executed.And will live on to be one of the most memorable conclusions.It always get me.If there's anything out there in the theaters that will blow you away before summer season kicks off ,then this is a blast for you."
But Also because all the miscellaneous rightists and racists are irritated by its bravery and morality.Went completely in the right direction as compared to the usual right-wing claptrap.
"After being told over and over again from friends to watch this film, I finally got to it. Despite it being overhyped by them, I still found myself captivated by V For Vendetta. There was something brilliant about seeing our ""hero"" at face value just like every other character along the way. There was no Batman/Bryce Wayne, there was only V and because of that it made him more of a myth and much more intriguing for what he stood for.Vengence is in the title, but it so much more than that with a deeper meaning that rivals some of the best in Hollywood. I found myself reading more into the ""idea"" V represented. Now one of my favorite Comic Book Films."
"Placed in futuristic Britain, this movie tells a story about dictatorship and the man who became symbol of it's downfall. People from many, not to say majority, countries in today's world can easily identify with the characters. Great adaptation of DC comic and always gladly seen Natalie Portman.8/10"
"well... all i can say is goddamn.keeping in mind that anytime you see a movie as part of a major film festival world premiere, where the cast and creators are present, along with hundreds of avid film fans and press, it tends to raise the experience a notch or two... but having said that - i found it to be a work of monumental genius. i thought it was so amazingly good in fact that i actually had to say something as extreme as that to express my current mood towards it, which is still only a mere fraction of how i felt when i actually left the theatre. it was seriously that good.and yes, i'm biased, if you can call it that. but i like the wachowski's for a reason, not blind admiration. they're geniuses, and they've trained mcteigue well.naturally, i think it will be under-appreciated by much of the general public as its not nearly as action-packed as the trailer would have you believe, but whether it makes 100 mil or 200 mil, it should at least completely redeem the wachowski's legacy in even the most critical of critic's minds.i have to say, the rush of adrenaline i felt when...well, you know if you've seen the trailer - made me want to stand u and cheer. when a movie can make you feel like that, it's succeeded."
"You want to see where the ""Nationalist"" movement around the World is leading us? Think ""it can't happen here""? Watch this and despair - or grow a pair."
One of the best movies ever made! I could watch it over and over.
"To sum up the brothers' masterwork in one word is a quite impossible task, but I have come to the conclusion that V For Vendetta is 'perfect'. Nathalie Portman as the hapless chick is one weak link because she is not a good actress and her English accent is as bad as the Bridget Jones Diaries but the rest if just brilliant. Making this film all the more compelling is the classical music perfectly composed original musical score. This film deserves all the cult love bestowed upon it, especially the social movements it has aided. It deserves all these awards and more. V For Vendetta is a film that everyone should see and appreciate to its fullest extent. The good guys and the bad guys are so complex, so scary and so relevant that it will remain an immortal film forever. Homosexuals, Muslims, freedom fighters, media folk, cops, politicians and regular folks who believe life is just drinking beer and being stupid will benefit from watching this."
"OK, I only went to see this because of the Wachowski brothers involvement. I went totally expecting to hate this movie about a terrorist but it was so much more. I'm amazed to say that it's AWESOME! While not an action picture there's plenty of action and at least one funny homage to The Matrix. You've gotta see it. It's very inspiring, believe it or not and it didn't make me want to blow up buildings either. It just made me appreciate freedom even more. Hugo Weaving is terrific and Natalie Portman leaves Princess Amadala far behind with her performance as Evey. Everyone's great. Stephen Rea is terrific too. I just can't believe I liked this movie. I'm still in shock."
"Set in the not too distant future in a world with a totalitarian ruled state, V, the masked rebel looks to reek havoc and battle against his oppressors."
Honestly I am speechless after watching this masterpiece. Hugo Weaving is a genius who played such a difficult role with such a perfection. Full marks to Natalie Portman. A great movie which will keep you indulging. A must watch.
"Remember remember the fifth of November When I first watched V for Vendetta I didn't know much about it. However I have always had a fascination with darker comic book movies such as The Crow and some of the Batman's. I am going start by saying that the character of V played brilliantly by Hugo Weaving is one of those characters that will be remembered and is an instance classic. This in truth is 1 of my favourite Natalie Portman performances, she is just so full of determination and curiosity and it's infectious. The scene where V and Evey first meat is truly tremendous. V saves Evey from some men trying to rough her up, she does hold her ground, V shows off some kick ass moves and a very versatile vocabulary (see what I did there). One of favourite things about V is he is an antihero yet he still views himself as a sort of freedom fighter who is standing up for the opposing government. The reason why I love this movie so much is the true determination to do what is right and the casualties that had to happen. V was a broken body but a free soul that wanted to make a difference and he did so. Was everything planned, I don't know but all I know is this movie is a must watch and truly is amazing"
I wish they'd make a sequel to this. Portman and Weaving do a fine job bringing this vigilante flick to life.
"The movie V for Vendetta promotes a government in which the people decide what is best for the country, and their livelihoods. Throughout the film, it becomes clear that a close to perfect form of society is when the government is scared of its people, not the other way around. In addition, the concept that love can overcome evil is evident. The hero of this film is a woman named Evey Hammond, whose goal is to help a man called V to take down the over oppressive, and corrupt, government. However, just like any hero, Evey has a flaw, and that flaw is fear to take action since her parents were killed for rebelling against the government. Evey was captured and tortured by the government to reveal the identity of V, but she never did. After a long period of time, and being constantly tortured, all her options seemed exhausted, but she rids fear within herself and accepts her fate. She would rather die then let the government stop the revolution. Luckily, it was actually V who captured and tortured her to see if she was truly loyal. The final showdown results in the death of V, however, with her new found strength, Evey completes the final step in the revolution in which the parliament building is blown up. Evey conquered her fear, and she now knows she has the power and the courage to change the world. With the parliament building destroyed, the people are now taking back their freedom, and will most likely form a government in which their voice matters. 
The movie includes a few main scenes that, when looked at together, are important in proving the message of the story: any injustice only takes a single person, willing to risk everything, to spark a world altering revolution. To reveal the corruption of the government, the viewers witness the police's attempt to rape Evey. The very people who are supposed to protect the citizens are the ones causing the most damage. In addition, a scandal in which the government purposely infected children with a deadly virus that only they could cure is shown. This proves the corruption of the government, and, now, all there needs to be is the rebellion. V's single man invasion in a TV building allows him to be known throughout the country, and, this simple act gains him followers, more fighters. The releasing of the mask, hat, and cape that he wears to every citizen might just be the most influential scene because this act gives the citizens something they never had before: a choice. Lastly, the final scene where thousands of citizens gathered, dressed in V attire, and push their way through the police to witness the destruction of parliament. I agree with the theme portrayed in this film because it shows how humans, though extremely different form one another, are able to come together when the time calls for it. I believe that this is a hopeful movie that lets the viewers know that they have more power than they think; a government cannot function without the support of its people. In all honesty, I would not have portrayed the movie any differently. The film was extremely intense, graphically violent, and painfully realistic; however, this intensity was needed to get the point across that there a corrupt government needs to be stopped. 
The redemption that is portrayed in the film coincides with biblical truth in that they both end with the sacrifice of one to free the many from the evil. In the same way V risks his life so that the rest of the country may live in freedom, Jesus died on the cross so that the entire world could be saved and washed from their sins. Although the biblical truth is a much larger scale, the concept is the same. However, the movie departs from biblical truth in what actions V does in order to achieve freedom for the people. V takes on a more hateful and violent approach in which he assassinates corrupt government people, and bombs the parliament building. On the other hand, Jesus takes on a more humbling approach in which he basically shows kindness and unconditional love to all. Although V for Vendetta condemns evil, it also allows the viewers to think that the only way to destroy evil is with more evil and violence. The intense violence in the film contradicts V's ultimate goal which is to rid of the violent and corrupt government. V is fighting fire with fire, but he is doing what he feels is right and what he sees as the only way to achieve freedom. 
This connects to the worldview of post modernism because the idea of breaking from the traditional rules, or the rules of the past, and doing what you believe in, or what you feel is right, is promoted. The film does not directly explore this worldview, rather, it reveals this concept through V and his actions. V wants to create a world in which people have the choice to choose what to believe in. In addition, he does whatever actions he deems necessary to achieve his goal. Similarly, post modernists believe that people should have the right to believe what they want, and do whatever they want, and that what they do is their choice. Given this mentality, I think that the writers are trying to say that humans should never be forced to believe in something. What we choose to believe in is our choice, and each person should respect one other regardless of their beliefs. If one thing is for sure, people typically do not like to be told what to do because for some reason we like choice, and how we live reflects our beliefs. This obviously does not reflect the teachings of the Bible. The Bible is pretty clear that in order to get to heaven, if you even believe in one, is, in summary, to accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior. V for Vendetta neither denounces nor promotes the Bible or Christianity. V does not care what you believe in, he cares that you were able to choose you beliefs without any pressure. This is, however, similar to the Bible in that people have the free will to choose what they believe(you can believe in Jesus or not); there is no outside pressure, at least there is not supposed to be any. The Bible lays out its case to all who are willing to listen, and people can accept or deny its teachings; V is fighting for exactly this, the ability to choose. Christianity is not portrayed in this movie because this is not a movie about religion, but it does indirectly comment on religion. It reveals the dangers of religions and how they can turn into corrupt political systems that take away a persons choice. Every religion is guilty of trying to pressure others into their belief, or there will be consequences. The film calls out any guilty of this sort of pressure, and it basically comments this: people need to make their own decisions, and if there is disagreement, oh well, it was their choice, not yours.
Overall, V for Vendetta is not the most child friendly movie. It is extremely violent, in more ways than one, and the negative elements greatly out weight the positive. Some negative elements included an attempted rape, multiple murdered, lots of gun violence, torture, and encourages dangerous behavior. This movie definitely teaches that it is acceptable to do an measures necessary to fight for a cause, even if people's well beings are at stake. On a more positive note, the final message of the movie is inspiring. It teaches that it is ok to be different, and that people should have the free will to decided who they want to be; it inspires individuality. Even with a beautiful message at the very end, this film should not be recommended to everyone because of the negative elements states earlier in this paragraph. In this day in age, I think it would be acceptable that the minimum age to introduce this movie would be 13. At this age, children are beginning to be introduced to the real world, and they are just starting to figure out who they are. I think that this movie is a good introduction into teaching kids that it is okay to believe differently than others, but, most importantly, that people should not be judged for believing in something different."
"As I write there are 2050 reviews of this film, so I imagine everything there is to be said is already here. That's 2050 people who cared about it enough to put finger to key, and the vast majority adding to the polarisation created by it.I don't read graphic novels, so I came in blind. The first time I saw the film it captivated me, the second and third time I saw how silly it is, but remained enchanted, and I believe that is what the movie set out to do. There is something about V which stirs the spirit, and those who place it among the greatest are simply able to overlook its faults in the way that hope springs eternal. And anger punches the air.Everyone needs a saviour, and with the aplomb of Zorro, self- sacrifice of Christ and the righteousness of Batman, V makes heroes of us all, shoulder to shoulder. It's a fantasy of the enlightened that their fellow citizens, even if at the eleventh hour, come to share that enlightenment.I cannot see how The British, and particularly Londoners like me, can watch the shots of an army of masked, smiling revolutionaries marching shoulder to shoulder through the streets of the capital amidst the architectural symbols of power and not be emotionally overwhelmed. Those scenes alone for me made the entire project worthwhile."
This movie belongs to its own category. Brilliant!
Watched it again and I am amazed at the poetry and screenplay of this movie. It is truly a masterpiece.
"Or ""V for Versatility""? Indeed, when it doesn't warn about the risk of totalitarianism pending over democracies, through the Orwellian depiction of a Britain ruled by a Big Brother-like figure, yelling orders on a giant wall-size screen, and played by John Hurt,""V"" is a captivating cat-and-mouse chase between the rebels and the armed hands of the Law, characterized by two opposites: Stephen Rea as the good cop Finch and Tim Piggot-Smith as Creedy, the overzealous fascist with an ugly mug.Of course, the main attraction of the film is the titular V, that justice warrior hiding behind the now-iconic Guy Fawkes' mask and signing, like a modern-day Zorro, all his deeds with the mark V. As easy with words as he is with knives, V is a really fascinating creation we owe to the genius of comic-book artist Alan Moore. He makes his entrance when a young woman, coincidentally named Evey (Natalie Portman), breaks the curfew and is assaulted by two members of a local militia named 'Fingermen'. V doesn't believe in coincidences and sees in Evey the light of hope to shine on the future generations. Together, they meet on the 5th of November, and as a homage to the Gunpowder Plot of 1605, when Catholics attempted to destroy the House of Parliament, V orchestrates the destruction of the Old Prison.And with 1812 Tchaikovski Overture as an accompaniment, ""orchestrates"" is the right word. The opening scene sums up what makes ""V for Vendetta"" a great entertainment, it is both visually and intellectually captivating. It is the kind of experiences that urge you to go to Wikipedia so some extra knowledge can make the plot a little more understandable, and sometimes, plausible. For instance, I live in France where, recently, the government revealed the existence of a big database containing 60 Millions of names, which means the entire French population. This comes within the framework of the fight against terrorism but when you think deeper, you realize that a government will always have a ""good reason"". In ""V for Vendetta"", we discover the extents of the tyranny: banning and killing homosexuals, Muslims, communist or atheists, and it is revealed near the end that it started with a 'virus' plot.I don't see Illuminati everywhere, I know that some conspiracy theories are absurd but they shouldn't be used as an alibi against those that make sense and can be proved. The merit of James McTeigue's film is not to denounce something that might happen but to tell us that it might happen. The film was made in 2005, after the September 11 attacks, but the events prove them right, I just love a part where Finch, disillusioned, know that things will go out of control, starting with an incident that will give an excuse for the government to bring the army. That's how the Arab Springs begun and today, it changed the map of the world, for better and for worse, the worse is that it planted the seed of terrorism and Islamophobia in European countries. If there ever is a Third World War, it would be ignited by these two elements.I just read a complaint from a IMDb user about the positive way the Quran was depicted, and I was wondering if that comment didn't prove that hatred was already marching in. It's very interesting that a character played in the film was killed because he had a Quran, if you look at the perception of Islam today, due to events that are certainly not caused by the vast majority but a fanatic minority manipulated by foreign groups and God knows who, you'll see that we're not far from this reality. Ironically, for all its positive portrayal of Muslims as victims or camp-candidates (a similitude shared with the other visionary Sci-fi movie ""Children of Men""), religion is painted in a negative light, starting with the Bishop portrayed as a filthy pedophile.The standing the films seems to take is that the first victims will be minorities and the film even includes a poignant lesbian romance in the story. But who knows, maybe the real dictatorship will come from hyper capitalism that would ban every form of spirituality. The fluidity of the plot sometimes derails in order to make a political statement, and I wish the film took more time to be a political satire than a Manichean thriller. It is also ambiguous in the way it denounces a form of totalitarian violence while portraying violence as the means to an end. The most glorious moment of the film, was the magnificent street marching with all London inhabitants wearing the Fawkes' mask, and when the soldiers had surrendered, V had virtually won.So, did we need to see Big Ben destroyed? The people had seized the power, it was a revolution per se, and by inspiring them, the figure of V has achieved more than any other terrorist attack. But it felt like the director needed to end the film in a blaze of glory, and close the loop. It was spectacular but a tad predictable while something less flashy could have been more meaningful. ""V for Vendetta"" is never boring but it needlessly overplays the effects although it had everything to blow your mind, even the last speech by Natalie Portman gives you the perfect idea about the character, he's an idea precisely.And this is indeed an idea that prevailed, as the Guy Fawkes mask became the inspiration for the ""Anonymous"" group, creating a case where fiction preceded reality, and underlined its own prophetic aspect. The film isn't flawless but it is a must see in our difficult times, and I'm glad I could finally review it 11 years after its release and 11 years before the time these events will happen, now in 2016, on the 5th of November."
"Much has been said about the genius behind the script and ideas of V For Vendetta. They are all true and speak to the power of cinema when done with intelligence and purpose.
I would like to note the amazing action, entertainment, realism and most of all the acting as well. When one compares the acting in V with films like Star Wars The Force Awakens or The Last Jedi or any of the silly Marvel films it becomes so evident that there are actors and there are actors in this world. A film can be replete with special effects yet the actors could be deeply stirring.
The elite hate this film. The working class, the citizen, the human will love it."
The historical incidences and plot in this movie is the reason I like this film. The cast and director must have had a lot of fun with this production.
A master piece movie from a master story teller Alan Moore...I don't even wanna spoil anything..Just go and watch it...And you will understand V...
"The problem is to realize that terrorist groups, diseases and economic crises are used by the government to frighten you so that you will see in it your last hope of survival. ""I want everyone to remember why they need us!"" I've seen the movie on its wold premiere in Berlin, a city which has its own strong history with a reign of terror closely related to the movie. But in the movie, it is Great Britain in the near future which is threatening its own people. The graphic novel written in the 1980s by David Lloyd and Alan Moore never has been more actual than nowadays. President Bush's call for Congress to give him the power to use the military in law enforcement roles in the event of a bird flu pandemic - where there is no pandemic jet.V, who knows that not only diseases are used by his government to blame terrorist groups but in fact are home made biological weapons tested on the own people, is spreading an idea of freedom and weakens the government with real terror it cannot control.A very honest movie, strong pictures, a great story. 10 out of 10."
"I'm sorry that I can't focus on the movie, but a great movie I think should bring up things other than the story itself.Just like a friend of mine said, any government who bans this movie, it must be a government just like the one in the movie. Unfortunately, the government of my country, PR China is one of them.It's just what they do, although not so explicitly. Everyday, Chinese police censor all kinds of political sensitive content we can reach, put away brave-enough-to-speak journalists like Shi Tao, they even put up a project called Red Shield to control the Internet, which we always believed to be non-controllable.In China, we have never seen a TV show that makes fun of the God like leaders, cause all the so called People's media were never people's. And what we citizens usually do? Just like what they do in the movie, eating, fncking and and shutting.Thank God(every God we people believe in) there is still a country called United States, whose people haven't yet felt tired to remind us of how we should be living."
"I became astonished, as I just watched 'V for Vendetta'. I was wondering why I haven't watched it till now. One of textbook movie on very sensitive topics of Non-Conformism, Anti-Regime, Revolution.Acting: Hugo Weaving was just like a brilliant magician or musician or writer who had full command in his domain i.e. Anti- Regime, who has nor fear neither vanity. I always admired Natalie for her superb performances in Closer or Black Swan and above all this movie.Story: The dialogues and script are intense & honest. It is a thriller movie, but it is slowly revealed to me that its more than that. The story is filled with current events and great quotes. Also it has a definite strong political sense, and I can relate it with current circumstances in many countries.Direction: It was marvelous. Everything looks beautiful especially Fireworks, Home of V, Studio Scenes, all over dark yet compelling.Verdict: Indeed It's one great addition into my ""List of Movies That I Want To Watch Before I Died"""
"Truth to be told, I am not an avid movie watcher and there are even some classics I have yet to watch, but I have also seen quite a few so I wonder anything would top this. I didn't watch this movie for ages because my stupid judgemental self thought it was just another throat slicing action film, based on violence. Never could I have been more wrong.The movie is simply fantastic. I never knew there was such a thing as a moviegasm, but on the rooftop scene I was crying from joy and sadness at the very same time, it was overwhelming. Hugo Weaving is also great as V, this masked character couldn't be more alive, the little movements he makes with his body and head makes you kind of forget you don't see his face, and his intonation and overall the way he speaks makes you love him.Also, Natalie Portman is gorgeous even with a bald head, but much more importantly, every move she takes is completely believable. The thing with her and V will stay with me for some days for sure, because I am jus that type... The writing is also perfect and there is not one scene I would change.Also, the lighting - when he is sitting on the bed with the old lady, he is in complete darkness and she is lit - this, and other little things like it make it visually enjoyable as well. All of the movie is so damn clever, I cannot give it anything less than a 10/10."
"This is another movie that brings in the question of what if? Natalie Portman is excellent, V is excellent. Makes you think of how the government would actually treat the people.One man is on the mission to bring liberty back to London after years of oppression by the government. After being used for experiments and put through torture for years V recruits Natalie Portman to help in getting his message across. By spreading his message across London he gets the people to be able to get the nerve up to face the government. Highly recommended to see, I've watched it so many times and will watch it more in the future."
"While critics scratch their heads at questions like, ""Can a terrorist be a hero?"" and ""How could one man do everything V does?"", they miss the metaphor, and the point, of V for Vendetta.V at one point in the film says, ""...ideas are bulletproof."" The idea of this film is that unless the citizens of a country question their government's spin and propaganda, they will succumb to the policies of that government no matter how wrong-minded those policies may be.I'm sure it's difficult for pigeon-holing critics to accept a Wachowski Brothers script that doesn't revolve around the action sequences, but investigates the castigation of an entire society using engaging dialogue and intense, involving characters. And after the Matrix sequels, this is somewhat understandable. However, V for Vendetta not only surpasses those disastrous sequels, but the original Matrix as well in terms of cohesiveness and depth.This film must be a nightmare realized on screen for Republicans and conservatives the world over. They would have to label all of the non-government characters as ""unpatriotic"", and V himself an insane terrorist. They probably don't understand that he represents every free-thinking citizen of the world who is concerned about the actions and policies of his/her government, even though this point is made several times in the film. Further, they probably don't understand that the violent actions of V and his compatriots are symbolic of everything from peaceful protests over the War in Iraq to Senator Russ Feingold's resolution to censure President Bush. On second thought, they probably do see this comparison, and believe these non-violent actions to be just as outrageous as the blowing up of government buildings!Discussions of governments gone awry aside, V for Vendetta is a rock-solid film that kept me riveted and unblinking for the entire 132 minutes. See it on an IMAX screen if you can!"
"This film has become a symbol for all free men in the Arabic countries, I think it affected the Arabs more than the West, Egypt likes young people wearing this mask does not know that they were fully insured, once wrote a news website HTTP://Iraqi-website.com/ story guy wearing this mask for fun police had arrested and imprisoned for three years and he's locked up yet. Maybe the revolutions were not created for the weak, but I like this movie because he found me a fantasy I liked to live in it, perhaps state fair and the distribution of wealth but nice fantasy fiction, I watched the movie 5 times and each time I discover I forgot certain detail, hoping to produce again with a new vision might include Arab revolutions and violent religious extremism"
"The Wachowski Brothers are back at it again.  After their big hit with ""The Matrix"" in 1999, they decided to do another film, and to be honest, it won't let you down. This film is intensely thrilling from beginning to end, and really gets the adrenaline pumping. This futuristic story follows a man known by the alias 'V' (Hugo Weaving), a masked freedom fighter, who battles for justice against the government in London.  Put up against the totalitarian British government, a mild-mannered woman, Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), was rescued from an urgent situation by V. Very captivating and tremendously skilled in the arts of combat and deception, V, using unconventional and questionable methods, urges the citizens of London to rise up against the tyrannical rule of Britain's chancellor, Adam Sutler (John Hurt).  As Evey slowly uncovers the truth about V's mysterious past and that of her own, she emerges as his unlikely ally in the culmination of his plan to overthrow the British government to bring freedom and hope back to society. Hidden behind the Guy Fawkes mask, Hugo Weaving really proves he is a versatile actor. His character provokes thoughtful questions in a dystopian future, and every emotion of his character is brought out with such elegance. Portman also excels as she really is the heroine of the film, and she handles the role quite well. The overlying plot to bring justice to Britain is taken aback at times by the unlikely bond between V and Evey, and the scenes between them are touching and well handled. The film's use of darkness effectively displays the dystopian state of Britain. Although a lot of scenes were shot outside, they were always dark and in tight corners to give you the feeling that you were constantly being monitored, which you were. Also, the use of camera angles help distinguish the powerful from the weak. In the beginning of the movie, the camera always angled up towards the chancellor from the point of view of the people. This exemplifies the authority the chancellor has over the citizens of Britain. As the movie progresses, the camera angle slowly rises and eventually is directly overhead all the people in the streets. V is an idea, a symbol, a metaphor that cannot be destroyed.  A man can be killed, but as an idea, he is indestructible. His message becomes more powerful as people gaze upon him, but not the man underneath the mask. One man can only try to make a difference in society, but as a united force of men and women, great change can be achieved. An exciting adventure to say the least, this film has all the works: great directing, captivating script, phenomenal acting, and is in its own way, breathtaking."
Briliant. Love this movie. It is so breathe taking.
"*** CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS ***Alan Moore's graphic novel V for Vendetta is an elegant, thought-provoking and complex exploration of the meaning of freedom and the politics of protest. The Wachowski Brothers and James McTeigue have somehow reduced this to a film that pretty much says 'Whoa, dude! Terrorists ROCK!!!111!'It's hard to imagine how anyone who is a fan of the book could have produced this film. The novel is clever where the film is dumb, engaging where the film is boring, and subtle where the film simply blows stuff up. Where Moore's V is erudite and sophisticated, the best McTeigue's V can manage is a big speech of words mostly beginning with the letter 'V'. Principally to blame for this must be the screenplay, which is full of unwieldy clunking additions which are supposed to make you think REAL HARD YOU GUYS about how this is LIKE RELLEVUNT to NOW. The screenplay takes a piece which is about Thatcherite Britain and tries to use it to bang home a message about George Bush's USA. So, instead of Moore's extreme conservative regime, we are presented with a 'British' government of the religious right, which seeks to ban homosexuality and Islam in the name of Christianity. Anyone who is actually British will find this confusing and nonsensical, as there is no popular religious right in Britain. And Americanisms like 'lever' (pronounced 'levver' rather than 'leever') and 'elevator' don't help.Still, no one could really have expected the Wachowskis to produce a subtle or clever screenplay. But you might reasonably expect that this would be a super-stylish, high-action thriller. It isn't. The production design is sloppy - we're expected to believe that, thirty or forty years into the future, people are wearing exactly the same clothes and using exactly the same technology as they are now, with the sole exception of a little red bleepy machine which doesn't seem to have a function but might perhaps be a dictaphone. And, as for your high-octane thrills, well... don't get your hopes up. The action moves at around a quarter of the pace of the Matrix, and fight scenes are few and far between. In the climactic fight at the end, wherein V slays a whole troop of men, the film's signature visual effect finally kicks in: and it's... *drumroll*... knives leaving vapour trails. Wooooo. No need to bring a spare pair of pants to the cinema. Bullet time, it ain't.There are many problems with this film: poor editing, appalling performances, the pointless addition of a love story. But the main crime is undoubtedly the sheer stupidity that the Wachowskis have brought to the table. Moore's novel deliberately does not end with firm conclusions, but asks you to consider relative evils: the government is obviously oppressive and fascist, but V is no less totalitarian in his own convictions. When he blows up symbols of democracy and justice like the OId Bailey, murders those who don't agree with him, or tortures Evie to 're-educate her', he becomes more and more like the government he despises. In the film, this duality is forgotten, and V is presented as a straightforward hero. The conclusion, therefore, is that terrorism works, terrorism is good, and the ends always justify the means. The film of V for Vendetta misses the principal point of the novel, and ends up being offensive as well as boring and rubbish. Read the book, please, but don't waste your time watching this. And let's pray they never make Watchmen."
I watch this film every 5th of November without fail.
This is one of the best films I have ever seen in my life
"I was sceptical about this movie but man John Hurts performance, Natalie's Performance and those things V said.. stuck in my mind! The true meaning of the movie and the whole revolution is obvious and I appreciated it. At some point the movie keeps you tense and focused with its music and directing! Give it a shot when you re in a dark mood and you'll have fun!"
"This would be a great family movie it's only that it was rated 'R'. The story of a corrupt government that runs London with some absurd laws e.g. curfews at 11, no same sex relationships e.t.c. and one of its victims taking revenge on the involved parties, shows why people should stand together and fight corruption in any situation. Of cause, we shouldn't use violence to fight it but in unity, we can do wonders. I would definitely recommend this movie for it tells on heck of a story."
"If this had been a children's-movie rated by children getting the 8.3 it got, I would have understood. But grown-up boys and girls surely have better things to do with their time than to overhype this celebration of averageness into the top 250 of this website.The grown up boys 'n gals haven't rated a movie, they have rated subject-matter as it would appear. I guess that showing some concentration camp imagery, an evil Hitler-like character (a grumpy old man version of an Adolf anyway) and rehashing '1984' is enough these days to make something profound.I mean, why else would a movie which has obvious pacing-flaws, a script so full of nonsensical alliteration that it would even make a Vogon gnaw off his own ears, anything but a lavish plot, a pedestrian view on politics and an agonizingly bad performance by one of its leads (Nat Portman (God bless her soul and looks) couldn't act her way out of a high-school drama even if she tried it without a fake foreign accent.) be regarded so highly? Watching this borefest, my eyelids cramped from fighting gravity. I won't get into all the complaints I have with this talky and plodding twaddle, it has all been pointed out by other reviewers in the 'hated-it' section. These are just my two cents to warn anyone with an education about the incredibly inflated polling-numbers for this cringeworthy exercise in film-making, scripting, casting etc. It certainly isn't thé worst movie ever made, but it's average rating shouldn't be higher than a 5.5 and not a decimal more."
"I had no idea the Wachowski Brothers were still students. No really, I honestly didn't. I thought they were accomplished film-makers, but judging by the pretentious bombast that is here presented as something profound, I'll approach any further work of theirs with the same wariness I would work by any other bunch of opinionated undergrads.We're in Britain, 20 or 30 years in the future, and the Conservative Party has returned to power, now with sufficient mandate to do what it has clearly always wanted to do, transform the country into a brutal Nazi state  even though it was a Conservative government who stood up so bravely to the real Nazis (I'm not a Conservative by any means, but you immediately understand the sort of targets this movie is taking pot-shots at, and if you prefer your cinematic entertainment not to be filled with unsubtle student politics, then you're already irritated). Anyway, a superhero thankfully arises, one of those guys of many inexplicable talents: he can breeze his way through the most advanced security systems (without ever feeling the need to show us how); he can perform all kinds of acrobatic hi-jinks and is also a master of weapons and technology (again, without telling or showing us how or why); he is hugely well financed and is always three or four steps ahead of his blundering foe. He even manages to break into the government's own television channel and broadcast a message of hope (as they so often seem able to do in these dystopian sci-fi thrillers).Anyway, all this is a good thing because Britain is now an Orwellian police state full of dark alleys, creeping spotlights and crashing jackboots, where anyone and everyone is likely to get it in the neck, but the staunchly right-wing, Christian authorities mainly pick on intellectuals, homosexuals, Moslems and all the other minorities that student activists like to imagine are persecuted in the present-day West. As a result, our hero  'V'  is a guy proud to wear the moniker of 'terrorist'. He openly admits that his war against the state is born of a personal vendetta, and he'll go to any lengths to force his views on people  even imprisoning and torturing innocents in order to show them how terrible the enemy are (yet another half-baked student philosophy, where any means are justified by a righteous end). Of course V has a softer side too. Naturally he's a lover of the arts (students can never conceive of a hero who isn't at least as well-educated as they are). He fills his house with paintings and sculptures, and (completely irrelevantly to the plot) quotes the great works of literature at tedious length. He also appears to idolise 17th century 'freedom fighter' Guy Fawkes, a mask of whose face he wears 24-7.And yes, you've got it. This is basically a hollow, ostentatious, politically outdated lump of pseudo-anarchist propaganda. We could blame Alan Moore's original graphic novel, but hardly anyone read the graphic novel, whereas lots of people have seen and commented on the film, so it's the film we need to concentrate on. In any case, Alan Moore had the good grace to disinherit the film, so he's divested of all blame.Even at a purely technical level, it's flawed. The narrative is weak and full of holes: why is a simple chief-inspector of police investigating a case that has the potential to bring down the whole of society?; why does the state bother with a police force at all when it has it's 'finger men'  all-licensed thugs whose job is simply to terrorise people and who are above the law themselves; despite there being spies and surveillance cameras everywhere, how is that free-thinkers are still allowed to provide rays of hope?  in this case it's Stephen Fry's character, a closet gay and Koran reader (!), who regularly mocks the government in his television show, yet only now seems to attract their attention. Why do the British public, who are constantly shown scoffing at government broadcasts and disbelieving everything the politicians say (got to remind the working-class that we're not having a go at them, I guess) do nothing about the terrible conditions in which they live, when the authorities' hold on power is patently so tenuous?And if that isn't enough, the whole thing is massively overwritten, and overly talkie, and it uses lots of big words and Shakespearean quotes to show how clever the movie's authors are, and as you'd expect from a bunch of students, it preaches, boy how it preaches. But just in case the preaching isn't enough, there are lots of other bits and pieces thrown in to ram the message home: every symbol of evil seems to have a crucifix attached to it; Britain's clergy are shown to be child-molesting phoneys; her war-heroes are cruel sadists who would rather be concentration camp commandants.The acting is risible. John Hurt does his usual shouting madman thing; Tim Piggot-Smith is his usual sneering bureaucrat; Natalie Portman  presumably because she thinks she's at last made it into a 'real' movie  screams and cries a lot; while Stephen Rea plays a cop so stricken with conscience that it's a miracle he even lasted one day in his job let alone rose to the rank of chief-inspector.It certainly looks good, as befits the budget. But at the end of the day, it's all pretty empty and silly. The stuff and nonsense about November 5th, and the lauding of Guy Fawkes  who in reality was a religious zealot of the sort this film seems determined to loathe  shows how shallow and poorly researched it really is.In short, and in keeping with the World War Two feel, this is a pile of corny old tripe"
"I saw a preview of V for Vendetta at WonderCon 2006 in San Francisco, CA. When I found out there would be a screening at the Metreon - I was excited! See - for me V for Vendetta, the comicbook, is as important (if not more so) as Alan Moore's Watchmen and Frank Miller's Batman: The Dark Knight Returns. Each of those works deconstructed a society in desperate need of change or a savior. But where Watchmen and DKR gave more definitive and heroic resolutions, V for Vendetta allowed itself to end on a bleak and very downbeat note. It is a brilliant and subtle piece of work commenting on how anarchy and violence might be needed to bring about change.I give the movie credit for trying.It delves into the harshness of its iron-fisted government and the lies it is built on. It gives us Evey Hammond as someone we can relate to as she deals with the madness that is the masked and mysterious V. It gives us an authority figure in Finch, who uncovers the plot that lead to the fascist government's ascension.And it gives us V - a terrorist. Bad word for anyone in this day and age, but is someone who terrorized an unjust society a bad person? Would we feel bad if someone terrorized the Nazis or Al-Qaeda? We see V's back story - would we be justified in horrific acts of death and destruction if we were treated so terribly? Its the mid-point of the movie which contains its greatest and quietest moments - where Evey Hammond frees herself of fear. Fans of the comicbook will be thrilled to see this sequence is nearly identical to the text.Its the ending where the movie falters. It doesn't give any sense of just how things might change. Also, I wish more was made of how the people of England was changing in its attitude towards their government.Perhaps I'm being overly harsh due to my love for the book.But this movie is still worth watching - especially in today's political climate. It may spark some debate and get you to think about the people that govern us - and tell us what to do."
"V for Vendetta is amazing. There is no other word to describe it. It's a visual feast with a gripping plot and a message. You'll be glued to your seat all through-out the movie, and you'll come out sweating with your head filled with ideas. This is easily the best movie I have seen so far this year.I had my reasons to doubt the quality of this film adaptation of the graphic novel by Alan Moore at first. Although, I must confess, it is reading about this movie that made me interested in the graphic novel, it was simply written so brilliantly I was afraid it would be spoiled. Indeed, it wasn't an easy adaptation. The original graphic novel has very little action, and a mind-boggling amount of text, not to mention many numerous characters and subplots. There was also the matter of the Wachowski brothers. I did enjoy the first Matrix movie, but I was terribly disappointed with the sequels. To say the truth, this was a movie that was easy to screw up, and I had a feeling it would get screwed up. I was wrong, and I am oh-so-glad I was.The plot was changed for the film adaptation. The year is no longer 1998. The nuclear war was replaced with a deadly virus. But the idea behind the movie remains, even if the chain of events is different. But the film also added something I felt the graphic novel was sorely in need of: more action. I enjoyed the graphic novel immensely, but I felt it would have been more interesting with more action. And the fight scenes in this film are incredible: swift, stylish, and exciting. I did not like the changed made in Lord of the Rings. But in V, I did not mind the changes. The Wachowskis created a story of their own, based on Alan Moore's original, but different. And it works.There was, however, one change that was for the worst. In the graphic novel, V was insane, and there was no doubt about it. He wasn't simply weird, he was also unpredictable, mysterious and eccentric. V's character was brilliant in the graphic novel, and it was slimmed down in this movie. Hugo Weaving was great as V, of course, but by making the character of V more human, more sane, by making him romantically involved with Evey (who was also portrayed perfectly by Natalie Portman), he became less mysterious and less interesting. Not to mention, they made him more of a man with an idea, than an idea in itself. And that is a shame.All in all, this a spectacular piece of cinema. It's highly recommendable for anyone who enjoyed the original graphic novel, for anyone who enjoys comic book movies, and for anyone who enjoys movies in general. But if you want a different, yet more fleshed out plot, with a more interesting protagonist, pick up the V for Vendetta graphic novel by Alan Moore. It's worth it."
"It's difficult to see who exactly James McTeigue's 'V For Vendetta' is aimed at. Even given that Alan Moore's complex tale has been stripped to the bone (perhaps inevitably, as otherwise we'd be looking a looong film), it's far too wordy for most action-movie audiences  and, by the same reckoning, too violent for more thoughtful patrons. There are allusions to 'America's War' in the near-past, and of how religious fundamentalism and intolerance have come to shape the dystopia represented, but these connections are astonishingly heavy handed and unsubtle. This, plus the Wachowski Brothers fondness for cod-philosophising reduces Moore's incisive wit into something more blunt and unsubtle. That said, there are a few genuinely interesting comments made about the nature of terrorism which I'm surprised survived into the final script. No wonder the Daily Mail hated it.The biggest problem is the main character, the man known as V. In the comic book world (where masks are the norm) V's blank, unchanging gaze adds to his mystery. Here, though, his only expression is vocal, a great limitation of the talents of Hugo Weaving.A Prologue  intended, quite clearly, for American consumption  explains a little of Guy Fawkes and the Gunpowder Plot to destroy Parliament. To some extent I can see why this is done, as very few Yanks will have heard of Fawkes, and may wonder why our hero, V, dresses in the style of this historical character. This introduction sets the plotter up as an idealist, a crusader against injustice, which taps into part of what our hero is supposed to represent  the Freedom Fighter. It's a simplistic interpretation which does rather defeat the essential message of Moore's character and book. Fawkes wanted a new order, yes, but he fought on behalf of an authority no more democratic or tolerant than the one he sought to destroy. He also wanted vengeance on those  the Protestant King James, especially  whom he felt has persecuted his Catholic brethren. The bulk of the population considered him a terrorist  which is why his defeat is celebrated each November 5th. Moore's character is complex  recognising that Idealism, Terrorism and Vengeance are all part of the same destructive impulse. In the graphic novel V quotes, on occasion, from the Rolling Stones' 'Sympathy For The Devil', which is the best indicator of what the character represents  his own personal vendetta aside, he's an Anarchist, a catalyst for sudden and bloody change.V's 'origins' are hinted at, but by depriving us of the detail of the original source material he becomes more human, more the 'wronged man'  and, again, I can see why this was done, as audiences are expected to empathise with their hero  but it does make what he is (as opposed to who he is) less frightening. And V should be frightening. Another attempt to humanise V  the hint of romantic feeling between him and Natalie Portman's Evey  completely misfires.There are a few equally misjudged comic moments, the worst of which  a grimace-inducing 'Benny Hill' skit (more trademarked 'British' humour for the Yanks), but there are a few changes that actually work. Stephen Fry's Dietrich is virtually unrecognisable as the character from Moore's book, Dascombe, upon which it is based  but does, as a gay man masking a liberal outlook within a totalitarian regime, serve as a potent all-too-human counterpoint to our mask-wearing 'hero'. Portman's Evey is also a million miles removed from her source-character, but her screen persona is less successful than Fry's  a shame, as she could have probably made interesting work of that more ordinary, desperate Evey. For all the many changes I'm glad to say that the touching Valerie sub-plot survives intact.Tim Piggot-Smith enjoys a fine return thuggish form, and John Hurt overacts his wrinkly little head off as the Chancellor. Steven Rea is excellent as the dogged, sad detective Finch  probably the most loyal transfer of character from page to screen.Visually it has it's moments, and it is very stylish  as one would expect from the Wachowski Bros and Joel Silver - but very few of them are truly cinematic  save, perhaps, for the final Tchaikovsky accompanied scenes of Parliament, which was genuinely impressive.I was prepared to hate this film with a fiery passion, but didn't. It wasn't  to use what the scriptwriters seem to think is the only British expletive  'b*ll*cks', but it has no real excuse for not being considerably better, given that so many of the plot changes were so unnecessary. It's the best adaptation, thus far, of any Alan Moore subject  though given how bad 'League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' and 'From Hell' were, that's not saying much. That said, it is seriously flawed, and most of those flaws arise out of a basic misunderstanding of the nature of the central character."
"V for Vendetta is a movie I have watched so many times. In my opinion it is a life changing movie, it contains great meaning, excellent cinematography and amazing actors. The plot is unraveled in an interesting way that keeps you at the edge of your seat for the whole duration. Compared to the graphic novel the movie has a different story to tell, and that is not negative like most of the times a movie changes the original content during the adaptation. If asked I would instantly reply that V for Vendetta is my favorite movie."
"I have just realised that by watching V for Vendetta this evening I have missed Cronenberg's Eastern Promises on another channel. In light of V being awful that is genuinely annoying.There are several reviews here that deal with the poverty of the film's simplistic political message, its clumsy script and its nonsensical plot. (Evey imprisoned by V? Come off it. Dietrich's ludicrous decision to lampoon the High Chancellor? Totally unbelievable.)I didn't care for the characters, I didn't care for the politics and I didn't care for the production.Where does it get the 2 points I've given it from? There are worse films that deserve lesser rewards. Oh, and I liked the explosions."
"It is the year 2020. England is reigned by a fascist government, ensuring safety at the expense of freedom. How did it come this far? Not by a hostile takeover it seems, the British voted for it. But they voted under the influence of the most powerful force in the world - Fear. Some may argue that love is more powerful, but even love can be conquered by the fear of losing someone dear to yourself.This is the scenery that is painted by James McTeigue. But there is one who opposes it: V. Wearing a Guy Fawkes Mask, blowing up the old Bailey, attacking those who build this regime. It is not just V's biography that is told in this movie though. He's more than person, he stands for an idea maybe an ideal and we watch the story unfold around him as he guides us through London. Main characters are the absolutely wonderful Evey played by Natalie Portman and the inspector hunting V (Stephen Rea), slowly realizing that too many coincidences have happened in the past. V himself, played by Hugo Weaving never shows his face, but still convinces and puts on a great show.The message this movie sends is (and no doubt has been hundreds of times) to be debated as it glorifies chaos and the rebelling against the government even though the people do not know of the horrors their government has committed to gain power. But then again, do we know all about our government? Thankfully the movie dodges the problem of having a government overthrown only because of the revenge of one man and focuses on the essential: Act if you think there's something wrong.
Combine this idea with a dagger wielding masked man whose speeches could have made him a poet in a normal life and you got yourself one hell of a movie. Some movies want you to think, some are pure entertainment - V for Vendetta gives you just enough of both to have you sitting at the edge of your sofa in excitement while keeping you from sleep thinking about its message afterwards.
I would love to see a prequel and a sequel. How about F for Fake News (how a to grasp for power) and B for Building up Britain before Brexit cocks it up again?"
"When I first heard that Alan Moore's V FOR VENDETTA was being adapted for the screen, I enjoyed a brief frisson... but this quickly turned to a cynical wait-and-see attitude after I read that Moore himself was asking to have his name removed from the project. Alan Moore is known to be rather rigid in his scruples, but there are those who feel that his rigidity is overblown, and that the man is some kind of bitchy primadonna.Count me in, Alan. This film is a piece of garbage.Sure, it *looks* good. The cinematography, costuming, makeup, sets, and all around technical merit can't be faulted much, although the film does suffer slightly from touches of a misguided Matrix-like darkness. Many of the shots in the film are startlingly like panels from Moore's original graphic novel... but looks are not everything, and sometimes they're not anything at all. Moore's V FOR VENDETTA is a piece of work with a serious, vibrant, important, and challenging message, not a wretched excuse for the usual Hollywood explosion porn that one might find in any Bruce Willis action abortion. Director James McTeigue and screenplay writers Andy and Larry Wachowski should be ashamed of the gutting they've given Moore's work. They have hijacked a truly inspiring piece of truly subversive art and cranked out a hollow, incoherent, castrated, de-fanged and de-clawed mockery of it. Their adaptation is a dark triumph of idiot form over intellectual substance, an arrogant slap in the face laden with product placement to add insult to the injury. This is carefully preripped punk rock fashion being sold in Macy's. It's Pat Boone singing a Little Richard song. This film is Velveeta being advertised as top-shelf Camembert.I just don't know where to start digging into the fetid, cannibalistic co-opting that I see here. The only value this film has is as a touchstone for those of us who have read the graphic novel, and then only if we can overlook the utter debasement that has been perpetrated by McTeigue and the Wachowskis. Perhaps if we turned the sound off while watching.Before seeing the film, I figured that no matter how badly they botched and bungled it, no matter how cynically they sold it out, it would still be a worthwhile thing if only V's televised speech was preserved intact. And of course, they gutted and polluted that too.It could be argued that the politics of the film are nicely pointed, and pointed in the right direction: straight at the whorish corporate hearts of Bush's America and Tony Blair's England. The problem is that that point is (like the rest of the film's plot) muddied and blunted by an incoherence that makes one wonder how much of their zillion-dollar budget went up the noses of Mssrs. McTeigue and Wachowski in the form of entertaining white powdery substances. This is aside from the fact that Moore's V FOR VENDETTA was clearly, overtly, and unapologetically a manifesto of Anarchism as a polar opposite of Nationalism-cum-Fascism, while the McTeigue/Wachowski version is a thin, watered-down gruel that has rejected Anarchism as too radical, too controversial, and tossed it unceremoniously into the lime-pit in favor of an inchoate tissue of vague and fuzzy Democracy Lite... in fact, it turns our hero to the cause of exactly the sort of poorly defined emotional-response pseudo-Democracy that has been rammed down our throats by crypto-Nationalist neocon flag wavers like Bush and Blair for most of the last decade. The only relief here is that they didn't shove any pious Christian dialogue into V's mouth... I guess they felt vindicated in totally blowing off the original political message by keeping the story superficially hostile to the Christian Right (John Hurt as the leader of Britain's Fascist/Nationalist government is still clearly a jerk who doesn't believe in the separation of Church and State, the kind of pig who is busily ruining America by insisting on the legislation of Christian morality in all contradiction of the concepts of religious freedom and ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"").Vendetta against those who would co-opt our nobler impulses and our rebellion in the name of corporate profits! And while we're at it, all hail Alan Moore... not so much for creating V FOR VENDETTA in the first place, but more for refusing to allow his ideals to be compromised by mere money, and for having the stones to disassociate himself utterly with this bowdlerized, bastardized, perverted, and ultimately worthless adaptation instead of taking the money and spreading his artistic legs like every whore in Hollywood who drops trou and bends over for big money business transactions. Woe unto those who actually paid to see it, and had no chance to make a similarly informed decision; for them (in an intellectual and political sense) this film is nothing more than a brutal symbolic gang-rape at the hands of counter-revolutionary corporate goons.If you ever needed a justification for using BitTorrent to preview a film before coughing up your hard-earned money, this is it."
"V for Vendetta was a weak attempt at political commentary and a simplistic illustration of revolution. I couldn't help but laugh at the ending with the fireworks and people. I think I'm going to make a movie that harps on peoples ignorance and emotions. I'm going to fill it with images of death for shock factor, make knives fly in slow motion (instead of bullets like they did in the matrix) because I can't think of anything original, and make my protagonist hero/terrorist speak so ""eloquently"" so that the movie seems smart because no one can understand the alliteration blather coming from behind that mask. The one thing I was impressed by was Hugo Weaving's ability to recite his lines. Natalie Portman was garbage as always. Characters: all 1-dimensional. The action was generic and predictable. When it comes to IMDb ratings, some people jump to say that this is ""the worst movie ever"" and give it one star. That is silly as anyone with a brain can see that there is a tremendous difference between it and ""SuperBabies: Baby Geniuses"" which holds a bottom spot on this site. However, it is not even close to worthy of a top 250 berth. 6/10"
"A captivating take of the comic book with the same name, V for Vendetta is not your ordinary revenge or superhero flick. The main character of V is presented like more of a legend then a full flesh superhero bringing justice to a time where everything is thrown into strict government surveillance and totalitarianism. He is more of a whisper and beacon of hope aiming at bringing back the individual in society long overrun government agents and informants killing every thought or action not aligned with the plans and aspirations of the state. It is a gripping story about change, hope, individualism and free will that is surprisingly deep and it leaves a huge impression on every viewer."
"Dwight Eisenhower warned us of the military-industrial complex, and George Orwell warned us of Big Brother, Terry Gilliam illustrated full bureaucratic control of our lives in Brazil (and later with The Zero Theorem), and V for Vendetta reminds us that every now and then, we need a revolution. Recent revolutions in the world include the American Revolution, the French Revolution, The Russian Revolution, and the Chinese Revolution. One could even say in 1989, there was an Anti-USSR Revolution. The producers and directors of this film were most likely influenced by Lech Welesa and Solidarity with its revolt against the USSR. It is ironic that countries that were created by revolutions eventually become countries that need them again.
England has not really had one of these revolutions; so the premise of the film is interesting. As a film, standing on cinematic standards alone, it is entertaining, uneven, has problems with pacing, but has strong character development, a good story, and excellent production values. The cast is excellent as well. Natalie Portman is superb, as is John Hurt. Today, we obviously have Anonymous as a new revolutionary force in the world order. How effective they are is a matter of opinion and conjecture. However, they would appear to be a healthy outgrowth of the need of countries to give themselves a good enema once in awhile. Well worth viewing."
"This movie is beyond all those words mentioned in the title. It's a masterpiece. Kudos to Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman. They did an incredible acting. For many years, I had been ignoring this movie (for some weird reason, I know I was being stupid) until this very morning I decided to give it a try. Well I must say everyone who appreciates a Thriller Movies, must watch it. Its an spectacular masterpiece."
I love dark vigilante films and this one takes the cake! Hugo Weaving is magnificent in this. It's one of the most unique films of the 21st century!
"This movie will always be my top of the list. I must have watched this movie 99 times now (I'll make it 100 on the 5th of November). I love how this movie has an equal amount of fiction and realism, and unfolds in such a way that is so comprehensible. I have watched it so many times, yet each time I am on the edge of my seat during scenes that'll give you goosebumps. The narrative and the script are an unforgettable experience that forge themselves onto the viewers heart and mind alike.
I love this movie beyond anything and I would definitely suggest that more people should watch it. It is a profound joy to be able to appreciate such an extravaganza on a public platform.
Thank you!! Hope my review was helpful!"
My favorite movie ever! Absolutely the best movie I've ever seen!!! Saw it 4 days ago and still can't get over!!! How can one write the story like this!!! The most brilliant story and cast and filming!!! The characters are so well played! It's unforgivable! I'm not normally watching the film a second time. But with V for vendetta I just can't wait to see it again! Will have to get a book and also a DVD to add to my very-very strict DVD collection. Don't expect just to relax and watch the movie. It's very tense and it's getting tenser to the end of the movie. You will be completely overwhelmed by the time you finished watching it. A try peace of art! The top of my list! Highly recommended!!!
"Like many i was skeptical about v. i had read the comic, and enjoyed the wachovski brothers work, i was carefully optimistic.I saw it the day it came out there were very few people at my theater i was shocked. when the credits started to roll i stood up and applauded , i NEVER do that. i was even shocked at myself. after being pulled through each and every movie i've seen over the past few years i found a gem, a diamond in the rough. This movie was incredible. i believed in the characters, i laughed with them i felt sorry for them, i felt their rises and falls. the story was incredible, it was churned out from the page to the screen so beautifully. and it had a message. i don't mean that sappy message you get at the end of a Disney movie. it spoke to me, i made the connections, i followed the dotted lines, and i was impressed, it showed the evils of the world and it showed that freedom is a price you must sacrifice, avenge, and possibly die for. if somethings not right you do something about it, an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth, all that good stuff. all in all v for vendetta was a movie i will not soon forget if ever i was appalled when i walked out of that theater some guy said ""that sucked"" then i realized that not everyone understood what i understood, a lot of people just saw a guy in a mask. i felt sorry for them i hope if you have not seen this film, you will. i gave this a 10 out of 10 with all my heart. I hope you enjoyed this review, until next time... FREEDOM FOREVER!"
"There aren't a lot of movies that I care to watch. Too boring, too gory, or just plain stupid. This is not one of them.V for Vendetta, is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. I got the DVD and watched it three times. I could watch this movie forever.Best love story, best action, best plot, and the acting was outstanding.You hated Hugo Weaving in the Matrix, but you will love him in this. Natalie Portman has, definitely , made her mark, no more Star Wars cartoons for her. The 'Valerie' scene was so powerful, so powerful, indeed. Yeah, I cried.Excellent."
"Wow, went to see it with a bunch of prior feelings of oh god another crummy movie of 06 But believe me, if u want a movie that incorporates the following things: Fast Paced action, a good plot, humor, Nathalie Portman, and a good amount of criticism against totalitarian governments. Obviously it is a strike against current anti gay views, conservatism, etc. (sorry previous reviewer ... i tend to disagree and it doesn't hurt pushing the liberal agenda ... yes it is fiction but so is American Idiot by Green Day, that doesn't mean there is a message behind the fiction... or as they say in the movie: ""Artists use lies to tell the truth; Politicians use lies to cover it up"") ... Best movie in a while, hands down."
"When I go to a movie, it's either to make fun of it or because I really have nothing else to do on Friday nights. Last night, I saw 'V For Vendetta' and I blown away. I didn't go to make fun of it of course, but I was just floored.The political satire was wonderful. Using Muslims and homosexuals as scapegoats for the things wrong with society and lying about searching for weapons so as to torture citizens in unknown prisons are parallels to today's America, even though the movie took place in the future in England. :) I was amused that the USA had been through a Civil War and was now a Leper Colony. That's a WONDERFUL future for the Americans, wouldn't you say? (I'm being sarcastic of course) I didn't care for some of the slow motion knife twirling, but even that was overpowered by V actually slicing someone. The great thing about this film is that it's almost unbelievable and ridiculous to a point, but because V represents all the people (as Natalie Portman's character states in the film) you feel sucked in and you love V as a hero, you want him to represent you.I also like how they did have some humor in the film. When Evey wakes up and goes into the kitchen, V is in a frilly apron making her breakfast. When he introduces himself to her in the street, his diction is made up mostly of words that have the lette v or begin with the letter v. He said it all so quickly and it was just amusing.I suggest this movie for anyone who is in the mood for some Bush-bashing, impressive action sequences, and damn good music."
"Astonishing. Easily the best film I've seen in my years. It combines create cinematography, writing, screenplay, and directing into a conglomerate of breathtaking film. This film makes you want to be involved, stand up, and see it again. Furthermore, it's a film that will stick with you.If you can go into this movie with an open mind and willingness to think and not just be spoon fed a story, you will fall in love with the piece the Wachowski's have brought to you. From start to finish you are engaged in a inspiring tale that uncovers just enough for you to figure out things by yourself. There are many times you can feel your whole body receive goosebumps, and many more times you can look around and see smiles or looks of worry on peoples faces around you in the theater. Do not be scared away by the mask, many people have said it's the reason they don't want to see this movie. It's not scary, it's not silly, Hugo Weaving turns the mask into a fully breathing, living character you yourself might find admiring."
"Oh,really a stunning performance by both excellent actors Hugo Weaving as (V) and Natalie Portman as (Evey) and great outline of the plot of a dramatic story excellent action and scenario as in the tag line that was said by Hugo Weaving as (V)Beneath this mask there is more than flesh. There is an idea and ideas are bulletproof.I really was amazed by this i think it deserved what it take to make an excellent movie and my god the Wachowski brothers they really got with that movie after the Matrix sequels the definitely made me enjoy that movie and i think others will.It was really great i loved it pretty good Directeing by James McTeigue it was so cool me and my girlfriend and my friends loved it was never less than Matrix sequels it was excellent."
"This was an excellent drama akin to the stories of Brave New World or Fahrenheit 451 in its scathing indictment of those who rule through fear and force. I enjoyed the story and the characters immensely. Though you never see Hugo Weaving's face, his dialogue is masterfully delivered, both a charm and an inspiration all at once. Natalie Portman clearly delivers one of her most stunning performances and projects convincing emotion in her demonstration of an internal struggle. The writing for this project was well done and stands out as a remarkable work of drama whose powerful statements will continue to thrill and haunt you for years. Although I know the graphic novel it is based on was written as an indictment of the Thatcher administration, it nevertheless stands as a reminder to all people of all nationalities that freedom is earned and totalitarianism is given away."
"Plot Outline: In the near future a freedom fighter known only as ""V"" rebels against the now fascist government of Great Britain. This visual aspect of this film is spectacular. The direction and cinematography has the right texture to each part of the story to successfully pull you into it. The dialogue can be a little ""par"" but has some power within it and has many nuggets of dry-humor. Many people probably won't find some of the jokes that funny, or even notice they are there. But those who do will be laughing.The best part of the film however is the story and message it gives, which is an important one. It is a warning about giving up too many personal freedoms for sake of security, which many people in the United States are too willing to do. That people must stand up for their freedom no matter the cost or public opinion of them. In the film the fictional government and its leaders use their power and influence to control the country's citizens through fear. They also round up, torture, experiment on, and kill certain groups much like in Nazi-Germany. Muslims, homosexuals, and political activists who disagree with their policies are the majority of these. ""V"" rebels against this evil government he is labeled as a terrorist. Though he does do some evil himself, it is a necessary evil to wake the citizens up from their fear. So they too will be able to stand up for the freedom that they believe in.There are also commentaries within the film on how the media is way for the government to spread its propaganda and continue to spread fear throughout the population. They even have one of the characters ""The Voice of London"" as an obvious representation of Bill O'Reily. Which I thought was great touch the film.Note to Certain Viewers: If you are a close-minded conservative you will probably see this movie as anti-American. While it is certainly a critique of the direction America is now heading (which in itself is anti-American), it does not question the long-forgotten founding principals that America is supposed to have been built on."
"Just like the main character itself, this movie is an icon, for fighting for freedom and liberty in the widest sense of the word.The movie is multiple layered, filled with symbolism and deeper meanings but with one clear main message in it; People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people. It shows that if enough people are behind something, things can be achieved. Even killing and acts of terrorism can be justified. As the character V's says it; A building is a symbol, as is the act of destroying it. Symbols are given power by people. A symbol, in and of itself is powerless, but with enough people behind it, blowing up a building can change the world. The movie shows obvious interesting parallels to western leaders and governments but also that of the middle east and beyond. The parallels to the Hitler Nazi period were perhaps a bit too extreme and over-the-top to find it credible but in this case I can forgive the movie for that, since it still makes its point clear and works powerful as a thought provoking movie. For this movie truly is one of the most thought provoking movie of the last couple of decades. The movie forces us to use our minds constantly and makes us see how certain acts of violence can be used for the good cause and how symbolism and one act can inspire people for coming into action and to doing the right thing. Leaders shouldn't just be able to get away with everything they do.Almost every aspect of the word freedom is present in the movie. Some in a symbolic way, others in a more obvious way. Such as freedom of speech and censorship in the media, freedom of religion (some people see this movie is anti-Christian, quite frankly I really don't see why) and freedom of being able to chose your own sexuality and being able to do what ever makes you feel good and happy. The movie also shows interesting parallels with recent issues and issues from the past, from all over the world, such as the earlier mentioned censorship in the media, which still is the case in certain middle eastern and communist countries, the ex scandals in churches but also the use of violence and terrorism against a governments their own citizens, to control and and form the people. It's refueling the conspiracy theories that the American government itself was behind the 9/11 attacks, to put fear into the people so the government was more able to do the things their way and gain from it, by getting the people behind them and exploiting from the people's their fear. But also less recent issues such as performing medical tests on prisoners, in order to create a super-race and more Nazi like references. In other words, more than enough interesting parallels to make you think about the world we're living in today.What ""V for Vendetta"" also does well is mixing action entertainment with thought provoking, almost poetic like elements. In the essence the movie is still an action movie that is fast paced and has a fair amount of violence and fight sequences in it. The action sequences are shot spectacular and form some of the highlights of the movie. But of course ""V for Vendetta"" is far from your average 'superhero' movie, it's a too important and relevant movie for that. The characters are also symbolic. Of course the character of V is the best example of this. Behind the mask there is more than flesh. Beneath this mask there is an idea and ideas are bulletproof. I quote V a lot, since everything he says in this movie is true, even when your initial thought might suggest otherwise. Evey is a character who begins as a normal person but slowly starts to becoming just a fearless, determent freedom fighter as V is. Inspector Finch is a normal cop who start to discover and see through the lies that his government, for which he works, spreads and he slowly begins to see the whole picture and V's true intentions. And Chancellor Adam Sutler is symbolic for basically every dictator that ever lived and ruled.The movie is a very good looking one. The cinematography by Adrian Biddle is truly spectacular and this movie was a worthy last picture for him. The special effects are also what makes this movie a really spectacular one.The acting is also of a very high order. Hugo Weaving is great, even though he wears a mask during the entire movie. He acts through his mask and manages to give the character an own personality, complete with working and sensible emotions in certain sequences. Natalie Portman is also great but it sort of makes you wonder why she was cast in this, since she isn't British. Her accent just doesn't sound right but I have to admit that she never looked any better in a movie. She is absolutely beautiful. It was also great to see Stephen Rea in a big production again. John Hurt convincingly plays the villainous dictator. Is there any role that John Hurt can't handle? He is a very versatile actors that has already played a wide range of different characters. Really amazing.But as a movie it is a rather flawed one to be perfectly honest. The story doesn't always flow and the character development and treatment is also lacking at times. It's obvious that James McTeigue still has a lot to learn when it comes to directing. But it however doesn't take away any of the movie its power or messages. The movie succeeds in what it tries to achieve and because of that I consider this movie as an absolute and important relevant masterpiece.See this movie for its action or its messages. Either way you'll be pleased.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"I can't point to a single film by the Wachowski brothers that wasn't cheesy, over-hyped, unoriginal, and just downright pathetic. I guess the first Matrix film was alright, but that's the closest they have ever gotten to deserving even half the acclaim they get from mindless ""fine cinema""-whores. Or, in other words, ""People who do not have the ability to disagree with the critics, because they have no brain to make their own judgments."" If they critics call it original and daring, they call it original and daring, even though they've seen a hundred other movies just like it. That is the only reasonable explanation I can see for the mass love for this film.Here are my ABCs of V for Vendetta: A for Annoying. The directing and camera-work are so bland and typical I felt like I was watching a children's TV show. The two main leads are okay acting, but every single secondary character, EVERY single one, are so bad at acting I occasionally had to pause the movie so I could stop and laugh. And I'm not someone who usually cares about bad actingthis was just terrible. What also annoyed me was the level of pure cheese the movie carries and sustains. Gunshots don't bleed, typical stabbings are off-screen, and even some fistfights are off screen. It just added to the children's TV show feel the directing and acting started. How did this movie get and R-rating? I've seen PG-13 movies (like Cloverfeild and The Dark Knight) that have more violence/blood than V for Vendetta. The MPAA puts this on the same level as Saw III and Hostel: Part II? Dear God, our rating system is so screwed up it's not even funny. V for Vendetta did not deserve and R-rating by any means, and I think they honestly slipped the MPAA a little cash to rate it such.B for Boring. Just so anyone out there who hasn't seen this yet knows: this is not an action movie. If anything, V for Vendetta is a political drama. There are maybe two main action sequences that last about five minutes each, and the rest of the runtime is old men rambling about terrorists. The plot is no more complex than you're standard, cliché James Bond plot: terrorist appears, and old men with guns talk about him for the majority of the movie, then in the last ten minutes when the ""climax"" starts they finally stop talking about the terrorist and try to do something. In V for Vendetta, when I say the majority, probably 95%, of the movie is nothing but repeated dialogue, I mean it literally. If you were to fast-forward through all the all talking scenes, you'd still understand the plot because it's so generic. You'd also have a fifteen-minute long movie.C for Cliché. As I said, the plot is a rip-off of the books that ripped-off 1984. Giant speakers, evil dictator, TVs used to make mass announcements, people have no freedom . . . blah, cliché, blah, blah. V leaves a rose after he kills, just like every cliché ""sentimental"" killer in movie history. The reason he wears a mask and why he seeks vengeance is also the biggest cliché in movie killer history. Also, the ""government lies"" jokes were so cliché and annoying I was about to turn it off. As if we haven't heard a thousand times that the government is evil! The movie doesn't even give the audience credit for having basic intelligence of political issues. I cannot name a single aspect of this movie that was original, or even close. The entire movie is the biggest cliché ever.Overall, V for vendetta is a waste of time. It is just a boring drama with a cliché ""moral"" that we've heard all our lives. Sure, V himself is cool for a few minutes, but when you realize the knives he carries are just a sales gimmick because there is less action than you could see walking down the street, just know I told you so.1/10"
"What annoys me most about this empty, vacuous film is that it started so well, and seemed like it was going to be an intelligent comment on the war on liberty that the British government is currently engaged in. The main character is a caricature, sure, and the dystopian state an exaggeration, but there is sufficient reference to the political smoke and mirrors of today (""rendition"", ""terrorism"" and so on) to make it clear that the directors clearly think they have something worthwhile to say on the current situation. God knows, someone needs to start saying it.Yet the ultimate message of the film is that violence is acceptable provided you think you're right. The hero, V, foments an anarchist revolution as vengeance for having been used in a secret biological weapons programme - he says that ""I am what they made me"" - and the opening sequence, where he takes control of a TV station and urges clichéd, typecast, idiotic proles to take the power back, certainly flatters to deceive.Yet the film fails to notice that the gestures of V are as stylish, empty, and utterly image-dominated as the government that he is supposedly against. It's no use railing on, as the hero does, about how ""ideas are bullet-proof"" - this is exactly what totalitarian states rely on, the idea that their ideas are common-sense and utterly beyond debate or disagreement. What are V's ideas? It's never really clear, beyond the (again) clichéd trope that revolutionaries have the best style, the best clothes, the best pads and the best lines.If the Wachowski brothers really want to rouse us from our slumbering disregard for the extent to which our lives are controlled by power, which seems to be the message of this film and the Matrix (remember the closing credits of the first Matrix film, with 'Wake Up' by Rage Against the Machine blaring forth), then what do they offer besides some vague idea that you can overthrow the powers that be using nothing more than some stylishly choreographed fight scenes and explosions, a dashing cloak, flaccid literary quotes and monstrously cool set design? That's all this film has, and while it's entertaining and fun, at its heart is not steely resolve but a pathetic emptiness, as deep as that it claims to oppose.Complete crap."
"I love a good dystopian future story and this adaptation of Alan Moore's graphic novel, while straying from a few of the original themes and ideas, is one of the most successfully built worlds I've seen on screen. With little to no warning we are thrust into the heart of a country gone horribly wrong and as the film progresses we begin to piece together the mystery of how it all came to pass. Heavy with intrigue and political satire, its themes of corruption and Orwellian paranoia are balanced with exciting action set pieces and beautifully choreographed melee from Hugo Weaving's V. V for Vendetta is a strikingly visual masterpiece, raising timelessly relevant morals and lessons around the nature of government and the power of words. Remember, remember the fifth of November."
