"Wolverine is perhaps the most beloved character from X-Men film series, but his solo outings have been the most forgettable and/or totally stupid. Thankfully, we have Logan to break that trend. Still have issues with it, but I would acknowledge that it was one of the best films in X-Men series.Good : Hugh Jackman gives the most intense and gritty performance as Wolverine in his final film role as the adamantium clawed mutant. I have always loved him as Wolverine, but he has never been so good. Patrick Stewart does the same in his final role as Charles Xavier, and in his part, there's nothing to complain either. Dafne Keen as Laura - owns the film. Loved the kid as baby/lady Wolverine (X-23). The setting feels really different in this movie, compared to those of other X-Men films. It is obvious that they gave a Revisionist Western tone to the movie, which hasn't been done in the genre so far. It acknowledged the fact that it was inspired by Unforgiven, The Wrestler and Shane, which if had not been done, would've made it look like a ripoff. Not a total waste of a film, it has good parts, but still a copied idea without acknowledgement seems bad. Then, there is action. The actions are the best ones in the entire X-Men film series. The choreography is great to say the least. It looks badass, savage and intense. But there's one thing that this film does with action which most action films don't with these days. And that is, have the actions mean something. Every action scene has a purpose. It either sets up a characterization, or aggressively portrays what a character is feeling. Acting, action and the overall story won't disappoint. Also, all the characters are interesting.Mixed : There are some story issues. It feels as if there is a huge story that needs to be told between the altered timeline of DoFP and Logan. We get tiny little expositions for that matter and sound like much more interesting ideas for a better X-Men Apocalypse movie. This made the largely different characterizations feel totally out of place, for both Xavier and Logan. It works for the movie, I like it, but I don't buy it. It felt a lot out of the place and quite confusing with why they were so different. With all the movies in the series, I don't think they have given all the character development necessary for those changes.Bad : Mostly, it's the villain and some logic issues. There's a video narration/exposition which looked professionally edited with great voiceover, but was by a nurse who didn't even have 12 hours to do it, keeping aside the resources. Xander Rice doesn't feel so good of a villain. Nothing to blame Richard Grant, but just not a compelling villain. X-24 does have a frightening presence, I acknowledge that. But all his likeability depends upon the character arc of Wolverine over the years. Just take out the ""humane"" part of the character of Wolverine, and replace it with Terminator's menace. You'll get X-24.Conclusion : It's a good goodbye to Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. You can get the unpleasant satisfaction of seeing him die, and it does hit emotional notes a number of times and feel really saddening. But there are story and characterization issues which cannot be overlooked and to be honest, do not make a good sense.Rating.Score : 8.2/10Grade : A-"
"When Logan heard that his comic book would work in a similar way, my expectation was a little more. Later Logan's first trailer ended me. The tone of the trailers, the selected music, the intensity of the emotion was superb. I did not get my eye from X-23 in action scenes. Very good performance. Sir Patrick Stewart, like Hugh Jackman, is the last time to portray the role of the X-Men in the universe. And gave a very good feeling and left the film with more drama.Logan, beyond his superhero films, a fickle old and sick man. He is constantly showing the struggle with himself. Unlike other films, violence and action are not adorned with visual effects, they are given in a very hard and realistic way. These old mutants are trying to save the children to make the world a better place.It's an action that will be an Oscar nominee from Hugh Jackman. Logan, it's a goodbye we cannot forget for a long time. 9/10"
"Logan is the 2017 movie everyone has been anticipating after two great trailers and a R rating it delivers a surprising amount of heart to characters we have grown to love and know and also balancing a surprising amount of action within the first and third act climax, its violent but not blood for blood sake every cut is with reason.Logan presents us with Logan (Wolverine), Professor X and Laura (X-23) and by definition its an escort mission involving X-23 but shes more capable than Logan and Professor X thinks and shes able to fend for herself. Logan is old and a grizzled shadow of what he once was and by going on this mission he unlocks some of the old wolverine inside of him and we see bursts of that throughout the movie, Logan also begins to realize things about himself through the vision of this little girl because they have striking similarities.Every scene in this film feels necessary from the character development to the humor and action nothing is forced everything comes off natural which is a breath of fresh air and I was very pleased with it, I believe that this movie will be very well received by fans as it treats its characters with such care and embarks on an emotional and satisfying conclusion to Hugh Jackmans Logan (Wolverine)."
"""Logan"" is directed by James Mangold and stars Hugh Jackman for one final go around as Wolverine. With an R Rating secured, something the previous two Wolverine films should have had, ""Logan"" was bound to be fantastic. It wasn't fantastic. It was phenomenal.If you are going into ""Logan"" expecting every scene to just be Wolverine tearing people to shreds you'll be thoroughly disappointed. This is definitely not an action film. There are action sequences in the film, but they are not the main focus of the movie like the previous 2 Wolverine movies tried to make them be. ""Logan"" is a grounded film, a film that really takes its time to tell its story and to develop its characters. It's a character-driven film, and it probably has the most characterization in an X-Men film to date. We get enough of Wolverine's backstory within the first few minutes to really become attached to him (if we already weren't). We learn more about Professor X and what he has been doing, and then there's this little girl, who probably should be annoying, but luckily isn't and that was a sigh of relief. This girl, Laura, is the star of the show. It is really ""her"" movie. All of the sequences with Laura were riveting. There was that sense of mystery to her character that you wouldn't really expect from a film like this. You don't ever really know what her next move is going to be. Her motivation to find a safe haven is so well felt in this film that it just brings you a sigh of relief that there is still a sense of good out there in the world of this film where everything seems dark, bleak, and hopeless. Hugh Jackman's performance. Yeah the dude gave it his all. This is by far Hugh Jackman's best performance as Wolverine. We've never seen Wolverine this vulnerable. He's old, he's broken down, he's beaten. He can't heal like he used to. The conviction from Hugh Jackman in this movie was just spot on and really captured the ways Wolverine felt at certain moments. It added layers to this film. When Wolverine gets into a fight, Hugh Jackman is so good in these scenes it's like he got into a fight with the filmmakers on set.This film does not hold back from a violence standpoint. From the get go, you know what type of movie you are in for. It is brutally violent, by far the most violent X-Men film w have gotten. Wolverine hacks, claws, and slashes his way through skirmishes with blood, guts, and gore flying. If this is what you had always wanted from a Wolverine movie and haven't gotten it up to this point, well this movie gives you all of that. From a violence standpoint, the violence is there when the film calls for it. It is not violent for the sake of being violent. This is a film that puts its characters and story first before anything else, with violence being a secondary element to help propel the story along and to create tension. It is in the scenes where it should be. If this were just an all-out 2 hour and 20 minute ""hack-and-slash"" fest this film would have no depth to it. It would look cool, but giving Hugh Jackman the proper sendoff was what was more important in a film like this.This film at times gets downright emotional. The final scene of the film makes you wanna cry. You care about these characters, you are invested in them. You don't want to see them put in harm's way. Even in the scenes where the film may feel a bit slow, the final act of the film is the payoff. This is where everything really meshes together with a force, creating a pulse-pounding, edge of your seat final sendoff for Hugh Jackman as he retires from the role. This is by far the best Wolverine movie and possibly the best X-Men movie to date. I haven't decided yet. It's up there, and it deserves to be. Everything payed off in this film. It is emotional. It is character driven. It has heart. It is emotional. This is everything anyone could have wanted in a Wolverine film.From me ""Logan"" gets a perfect 10/10."
"The word 'perfect' is very objective especially when it comes to film. While Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two decades. While many will be very sad to see Jackman step down from the role, he couldn't have picked a better or more satisfying film to end his cinematic legacy with.The film takes place in 2029 and shows the world in shambles. Mutants are nearly extinct, water is scarce and the world is just an overall wasteland. This is where we find Logan. He is a limo driving cantankerous caretaker to an even more cantankerous Professor X, who is now suffering from dementia and seizures. He is a borderline alcoholic suffering from a mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities. Due to this, he lives this quiet life until he meets a young girl who he feels he must protect. Without giving too much away, there is much more here than I can go into but I will say, if you are a fan of the Wolverine comics, this film will bring a tear to your eye. This is probably the most faithful adaptation of a comic book character EVER, Marvel and DC combined. The way the story goes, the way Logan behaves, the selflessness and the rage, this is an all around realized version of this character. While it may have taken a little longer than it should have, this film was worth the wait. James Mangold does a fantastic job at creating the world Logan knows now. This is more of a film like Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. It is bleak, violent and absolutely heartbreaking. This is far from the PG-13 character we're used to. This is a foul mouthed, miserable and very VERY bloody rendition of the source material. This is a film very much like The Guantlet or Badlands, a crime thriller and on-the-road drama. It very much embodies the look and feel of a film from the mid-70s and it plays to this very well. The performances in this film are amazing. Hugh Jackman's performance here is the best as the character and may be one of the best of his career. He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has been so attached to this role. If he hurts, we hurt. If he's mad, we're mad. It is a true testament to Jackman as an actor to make his audience feel this connected to someone who is, by traditional standards, completely unrelateable. Boyd Holbrook brings a sinister performance to this and continues to build a very impressive resume. Holbrook is someone who you'll love to hate. The real standout performance here is from Dafne Keen who plays Laura. Without giving away any spoilers, she is BADASS in this film and even gives Logan a run for his money on the brutality.Overall, Logan is a perfect comic book adaptation that is as heartbreaking as it is visually stunning. Mangold and Jackman create a special film with this that should be talked about for years to come. Believe the hype, Logan is a seriously amazing comic book film that just may be the best ever made and embodies the definition of a perfect adaptation."
Thank you Deadpool for opening the door to R-rated superhero movies.
"Let's cut to the chase, shall we? In every beat, every frame, every moment, LOGAN feels like the Wolverine movie Hugh Jackman has been waiting (and training) for 17 years to make. Set free of a PG rating, this wildly kinetic film has plenty of gore, action and violence pumping through its veins. But what makes this one of the finest superhero movies ever produced is the big, messy, somewhat broken heart beating at its core. Set in a grim near-future where very few mutants remain alive, we meet an unthinkable incarnation of our favourite enclawed superhero: one who's decidedly past his prime. This is not the near-immortal Wolverine we remember, but Logan (Jackman): a broken, far older man who feels the weight of every wound inflicted upon him. His once- formidable body – tattooed with scars that aren't healing as fast or as well as they used to – seems to be failing. It's only his determination to keep the ailing, ageing Professor Charles Xavier (Stewart) safe and alive that never falters. The film's plot kicks into overdrive when Logan's fate becomes entangled with that of Laura (Keen), a close-to-feral young girl who brandishes claws and fury as fierce and lethal as Logan's own. As the unlikely trio go on the run, we see echoes of Logan himself in Laura's terrifying rage and the tentative emotional connection she forges with Xavier. It's one of many smart moves on the part of James Mangold, who does double duty as director and co-writer. Bringing Laura into the picture allows him to explore Logan's trauma, regret and hope through the filter of this pint-sized powerhouse's origin story.In effect, Mangold has placed an intimate family drama squarely at the heart of this ostensible blockbuster film – strip the characters of their superpowers and LOGAN would still pulse with plenty of heartbreak and humanity. Logan keeps dragging himself through the world when one suspects all he wants to do is die. Xavier grapples with his own frailty as his once-sharp mind deteriorates and betrays him, again and again. Laura is a tough, tender mess of contradictions: a victim of horrific abuse but also a warrior in the making. Watching them interact – fighting, screaming, arguing, glaring and, once in a while, forgiving – will elicit laughter and tears (lots of tears), in a way that no other superhero film to date has quire managed.That doesn't mean, however, that LOGAN is an entirely joyless, sombre affair. Far from it. It proves, quite conclusively, that films in this genre can plumb the darkest of psychological depths while finding welcome ways to leaven the misery. (Note: this is something Zack Snyder would do well to learn as he continues to expand DC's largely mirthless cinematic universe.) Mangold threads moments of genuine humour into the proceedings – from casual shoplifting and runaway horses, to an ornery old man who refuses to take his pills. The fast and furious action beats in LOGAN are also quite delightful to witness. The violence that's on full, bloody display is dark and horrible, but somehow fitting for this film in which there really are consequences for battles fought and lost. It's only when you see Logan's claws plunging into flesh, shearing cleanly through meat and bone, that you realise just how neutered and family-friendly his earlier outings were. There's a slow-motion sequence halfway through the film, as Logan struggles to get to an embattled Xavier, that's gritty and beautiful to watch – as thrilling as that scene-stealing Quicksilver moment in X-Men: Days Of Future Past. And it goes without saying that watching Laura gracefully spin and slice her way through oncoming attackers manages to be terribly wrong and wonderfully right at the same time. To be quite frank, none of this would work without the incredible cast, all of them doing award-worthy work that will, sadly, be overlooked because their characters have such silly things as 'powers'. It's truly unsettling to watch Stewart dig beneath his natural gravitas to find the shaken core of a Professor X who's semi-consciously losing grip of his mind – the best and most dangerous mind in the universe. Keen is a revelation. Grabbing this breakout role by the throat and making it very much her own, she somehow manages to convey Laura's childish fragility and overpowering strength, often in the same breath. And, finally, there's Jackman. He's been training for and playing the role that catapulted him to global stardom for 17 years now, and he brings everything he has to this final outing as Logan. He nails Logan's physical tics, of course: from his grizzled and aged demeanour, to his rattling cough and copious drinking. But Jackman also takes delight in unearthing the dark sadness at the heart of this once invincible, now vulnerable man. There is a hope and purity in Logan that doesn't always show through his wisecracks, but it shines brightly and unexpectedly here – often in the film's saddest moments. There are a handful of things about the film don't work quite so well. The main antagonists, played by Richard E. Grant and Boyd Holbrook, are largely forgettable – there's not much that defines them outside their nefarious goals. As many viewers may be turned off by Logan's relentless misery and eye-popping violence as those who welcome it.But this doesn't detract from the fact that LOGAN is a remarkable achievement. It manages to be several things at once: a bruising action film, a tender family drama and an intimate character study, liberally shaken through with comic-book sensibilities and a Western or two. If Jackman really is hanging up his claws for good, there could be no better way to bid farewell to one of Marvel's most enduring and appealing characters."
"Holy Cow! We've finally got the Wolverine movie we've all been waiting for and then some! Mr. Mangold has nailed the character and the action, and Hugh Jackman is truly a part of a Wolverine movie that has showcased the true character that the fans had hoped to see full on. Yes, we've seen superb runs and flashes but nothing this deep or this epic.How could any movie fan in general not just adore this film? It brought elements of a lot of great genres. Logan has to be considered genre-defining. The characters, action and story were all beyond outstanding in this movie. We are taken for a ride and can relate to Logan once again. The acting is superb and the dialogue is perfect for the level of each character. Every single character feels believable. You follow the story through Logan's eyes and what a ride it turns out to be. This movie is emotional and moving in every single way that matters and is unique and is as far away from anything X-Men we've seen before. In this case, that's a very good thing. The fight scenes and pace are superb. I honestly could see Oscar nominations here on multiple fronts.This movie is sophisticated and delivers a grand, tragic story. The action fits in nice but serves the story first. Unlike other ""dark"" films, the tone is perfect and fits the character. The supporting characters are utilized in a comprehensive and cohesive manner and are wonderful in and of themselves. I loved everything about this movie and they left it as if this was the perfect end to Hugh's run."
"we finally get the Wolverine we have been asking for, for the past 15 years and it's his last time. Well i guess he couldn't have ended it in any better way as a last farewell to the fans and his signature role. Not only that but it looks like this one blows all the other superhero movies out of the water and i hope you Weebs go pay for your ticket to see this as well instead of watching a cam version online so we send the message that we want more of these kind of movies."
"This is a wolverine movie aimed at adults and definitely not for small children. The story is set in the future and Logan is taking care of Charles Xavier who has grown old and is incapable of taking care of himself. Logan, himself is now older and his health is slowly deteriorating as well. A young girl mutant enters their lives which sets off a story, which is not about super heroes fighting bad guys, but one that is on a more human level. ""Logan"", is a beautifully made X-Men film that deals with themes of importance of family, loyalty, and ultimately how Logan himself deals with new found emotions which he is experiencing for the very first time in his life.This is the crowning achievement in Hugh Jackman's role as Wolverine. It is the movie he and director, James Mangold had always wanted to make. It is a dramatic work of art and for X-Men fans, has plenty of action and special FX which are a definite cut above anything that has been seen before in Wolverine/X-Men films.A MUST SEE FOR ANY FAN AND A GOOD ENOUGH FILM TO STAND ALONE FOR ANYONE!!"
"LOGAN is brutal, merciless and powerful. This is a character-driven superhero movie done right. I would even dare to say it's better than many of the previous X-Men installments and spinoffs. And if this is indeed Hugh Jackman's final Wolverine movie, then my goodness, what a helluva way to go out in a blaze of glory.The story is set in the near future, mutants are thinning out. They've either died or been hunted down. Logan's (Hugh Jackman) healing power is not as strong as it used to be. He's old and weary and taking care of professor X (Patrick Stewart) in a hideout on the Mexican border, accompanied by Caliban (Stephen Merchant). But their attempt to hide from the world gets interrupted when dark forces arrive at their doorstep looking for a certain young little girl.Great move on the studio's and filmmakers' part to have this film be rated R because what we get here is Wolverine unleashed. The violence is as graphic and fully exposed as you can imagine it to be. So just that aspect alone will excite the fanbase who's been wanting to see the destruction that could take place when Wolverine is really really angry. Setting it on the border does allow the film to play with certain tones and color palette reminiscent to ""Breaking Bad"" for example, the film's ending however does provide a more vibrant environment as a base for an extremely bloody collision.The writing is solid for a superhero film, it really digs deep into these beloved characters, how vulnerable they are, how they long for a world where people would just leave them be. You truly feel for Xavier and Logan in a way that you never did in the previous X-Men movies, not only because they're now in their twilight years but there's also that father-son type of relationship that's tough love and endearing and then there's also the reluctant father daughter connection Logan has with X-23. By the way, the little girl, Dafne Keen, who plays X-23 is remarkable. So much force, so much energy, so much roar, she's like a cheetah that just runs and slices and dices left and right without prejudice, what an incredible young talent. This is a movie that gives you action to its fullest degree and an emotional journey that's uncompromising. The perfect film about the man who's the best at what he does but what he does isn't very nice."
"LOGAN - SPOILER FREE REVIEWAs most of you are aware I have not been a huge fan of the latest X- Men outings, but THIS WAS AWESOME!In a rather bleak entry we see a Post X-Men Logan, something has happened and the mutants no longer exist or there is a few of them out there. Director James Mangold chose to make the film almost colorless with much, much more character development than previous Wolverine and X-Men movies. We see a tired character that no longer belongs in a world that has feared him for over a century.While Hugh Jackman in his last outing as Logan does an amazing job and proves once and for all why NO ONE ELSE can ever be Wolverine, the supporting cast does a superb job as well starting with Sir Patrick Stuart who returns as Charles Xavier, Boyd Holbrook (Netflix's NARCOS) as an astounding and dangerous antagonist and newcomer Dafne Keen who is a rather sweet but incredibly deadly Weapon X-23.The movie is filled with gore and violence, but it does not feel forced at all in such an obscure movie. There is a rather new trend in Comic Book Movies after DEADPOOL, make them as brutal as possible, and while this started in the 90s with THE CROW and BLADE it has gained some track and more R Rated CBM are being developed as we speak.I HIGHLY recommend it."
"I really can't get how in the world people are rating this movie as highly as they are. You would think they have never seen this done, and done better.Yes, I understand that Logan is a heartfelt character dear to us, but THINK people! For that very same reason we should be holding this movie to a higher standard, and not giving it an emotional pass.To, me, this film was slow and depressing a-la No Country For Old Men, without ANY of the Oscar-worthiness. It was just droll, SUPER PREDICTABLE, moronic in its' execution and so very far-fetched. (Yes, imagine saying 'far-fetched' for a movie based on a comic)! They spun and bent a bunch of things to get them to where they were in the year 2029 and tried to make it believable (it wasn't). Then, they try to impress upon your heartstrings Logan's connection or ties to the little girl, but the connection or ties are SILLY at best. Not only the supposed ties between them are silly, but the entire plot is full of silly holes.Not SILLY, you say? Let me get this straight ... you are trying like hell to get away from the bad guys, and ummmmm, you STOP FOR A MINI VACATION - not ONCE, but TWICE, and put hundreds of strangers in jeopardy the first time, and a nice family in danger the second time? Yeah, sure. Seriously, anyone who could get over that gaping ridiculousness and who can, after that, in good conscience give this movie anything above a 6 is just messing with you or has total fan-boy blinders on. As for the little girl, god, she was annoying and aggravating AF and 80% of her screen time was spent shrieking. Nooo, not screaming. SHRIEKING.The rest of the acting was good. The members of the family they added as filler in the middle of the movie were the only ones IMO that you kind of cared about. Even old Professor X had seen better days and you kind of wanted it to be over for him. It was just painful to watch, and I don't mean in a moving way where the film is made better, but in a painful oh god, kill him off already way.*** BIG SPOILERS BELOW *** DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE OR ARE PLANNING ON SEEING IT!!!The ending was unreal in how bad it was. Without giving too much away ... you have one little girl who is able to take out like 10-12 guys, PLUS you have Wolverine, PLUS a BUNCH of other mutant kids who have varying degrees of mutant abilities, and yet they can't take out a small group of bad guys? W T H ?As for Hugh Jackman, he was good and played Logan like he always has done except maybe this time he looked older and more tired which was a good thing because it translated unto the screen and gave Wolverine some credibility. Otherwise he was just there. The gushing over his acting this time around IMO is unwarranted, as he really didn't do anything that much different than he has on every other X-Men movie and if anyone disagrees, I defy them to point out what. Props also to the action in the film, and to how it was filmed. The action scenes alone are what I imagine 'made' the movie for most people. All in all, I wasn't impressed. Don't get me wrong - it wasn't a horribly BAD movie, I just don't agree that it was very good and I really don't agree with the overrating or the assessment that it is in ANY way a ""masterpiece"". If you look at it just on paper, you would think that the people that are reacting to it in such a way have ONLY EVER watched comic-book movies in their lives and have now seen a drama sold as a comic-book movie and their brains are exploding as they process it as innovative and different.In closing, I understand that Hugh Jackman is getting older, and the great dilemma was 'how exactly do you keep making movies with an actor who is aging, playing a character who is supposed to rejuvenate or heal'? You don't. You kindly retire the character, as the creators of the franchise have chosen to do. The thing is, they could have really made it to where it wasn't SO depressing and/or bleak with no real outlook toward the future except a bunch of kids you are NOT at all INVESTED in, or care one iota about. A bad ending for a good character, was just bad cinema. RIP Logan. hopefully, at some point you will miraculously resurrect so that you can be given the farewell you deserve. My actual rating is 6.5-7/10, but some reviewers have gone over the top crazy with the 10s."
"James Mangold's Logan (8.5/10) About forty seconds into the movie, you confront a bloody Logan who isn't able to stand up while puny thugs decide to assault The Wolverine. And somewhere deep inside you feel a little uncomfortable. Probably because all you have seen Hugh Jackman do in the previous nine installments is watch the healing and indestructive Wolverine fend off anything that weakens him with utmost ease. It all fall aparts in Logan, Wolverine's swansong and an enigmatic crossroad of fear, uncertainty and reality. Wolverine is at his most vulnerable self here and yet far more courageous than all the rest of the X Men movies put together. And this is what makes Logan an extremely compelling watch; the chance and ability to finally empathize with a 'superhero' in a much finer sense and to witness whether they possess the same fortitude once their 'gift' has been taken away from them. Logan, set in 2029, narrates the endeavour of Wolverine, as he drives through the rocky, dusty terrains of El Paso with Laura, a mutant, blessed (with the same powers that he has) who needs to be sent somewhere safe. Along with her is a rugged, dying and somber Charles Xavier who wants to make sure that Logan is true to his word. Donald Pierce (played adequately by Boyd Hollbrook) is a raging current who needs the mutant and spreads considerable blood without any account of collateral damage. The repeated encounters take a toll on Logan's already dying self and even if he doesn't show it, over the course of time, he starts developing a bonding with Laura. He finds within her, the same embodiment of rage that turns people into monsters and sees Laura waging off the inevitable with a silent grace. The relationship which Laura and Logan share has several layers to it and can be interpreted in a much wider canvas. That's for another day. The influence of nineties western classics on the Logan is clear and critical. The homage is directly linked when Charles watches scenes from the 1953 classic Shane, and the lines are repeated again in a final scene. The dust symbolizes the ruins the mutant have brought upon themselves in their ideology of helping mankind marking their own destruction. Patrick Stewart is remarkable as a Xavier who is on the brink of death, set upon the call of epileptic seizures that capsize the lives of anyone near him and there is nothing he could do about it. All Xavier wanted his whole life was to stop people from getting hurt, and in his final moments he cannot stop himself from hurting people. This irony is a powerful strike to the entire genre which relies heavily on willing suspension of disbelief. Everything dies in the end, it's all about the manner in which it is achieved. Mortals, superheroes, they all do. Hugh Jackman could have become a lot of other things, a fine actor, if his brooded look would not have been entirely associated with Wolverine his entire life. And even if he strutted and limped along the way, in Logan he delivers his finest performance. Period. Every scene is a rave emotional experience and comes with a satisfaction of being content if not necessarily happy. He is in pain and so are we, and the audience agrees to be a part of it sailing across in the journey. Logan becomes an imperative movie in changing the face of the superhero genre. The need and allowance of superheroes to be vulnerable and uncertain instead of omnipotent and sarcastic is something I'd been wishing for a while. In Logan, James Mangold manages to capture every element which thrives on the edge of this conflict and the swansong he creates, becomes a painting. It is a magnum opus, a bloody opera and a massacred theatre room with audiences still lying out for view. And yet, it is beautiful."
"I look at ""Logan"" as the ""Alien 3"" of the X-Men franchise. It basically gives a gigantic middle finger to everything that came before it. It destroys everything the movie that proceeded it (""Days of Future Past"") accomplished. In ""DOFP"", all of mutant kind are about to be destroyed, but by the heroic actions of Logan himself, they survive. Then, according to the film ""Logan"", they all get killed off a few years later anyways. It has been said that one of the big themes of ""Logan"" was disappointment. I agree. I was very disappointed in this film.""Logan"" is annoyingly low on information. We are thrown into this terribly depressing future without a whole lot of explaining as to how we got here. As I watched, I kept waiting for a scene where things were laid down for the audience. It never came. The best we got were a few vague references here and there. There was something called ""The Westchester Incident"", but the reference was so fleeting that I barely caught it. There was also another part near the end where the main villain claims that he had something to do with the lack of new mutants being born and that he is Striker's son? I think? It wasn't very clear plus the dude's last name wasn't actually Striker, which further confused the issue. Later on, I hopped online and had a few things clarified (such as the ""Westchester Incident""), but why weren't they clearer in the film in the first place?Another issue I have with this film is how it treats the deaths of its two main characters. First, with Xavier, he is stabbed unceremoniously by a clone of Logan about two-thirds the way through the movie. There are no heroics in this death, no greater purpose, no meaning. He's just stabbed and then dies. What a disservice to such an incredible and important character to this franchise. Then there is Logan's death. Logan is impaled by a chunk of wood from a dead tree. The dude literally has a skeleton made out of adamantium, which is the world's most indestructible metal, but yet wood cuts right through it. What? Now, we are shown through the film that Logan is sick and his ability to heal is getting worse, but that shouldn't affect his crazy metal ribcage! They even go to great lengths to explain that the only thing that can really kill him is an adamantium bullet, but in the end a hunk of wood does just as well.Then there is the ""R"" rating. Once again, if this were a true stand-alone movie and not part of a larger narrative, I'd mostly be OK with it. But of course it isn't. Everything that we got with the ""R"" rating was unnecessary. What we got was far more blood and gore (there was more than one decapitation), a dump truck full of f-bombs and even one scene where a woman in a bridal shower flashed her boobs. All of this could have been edited out and the film would have been fine.Don't get me wrong, I am no prude. I've seen plenty of violent movies, heard plenty of f- bombs and seen plenty of nakedness on film. I'm fine with it, but it has to be there for a good reason. I didn't see a whole lot of good reason here. What really did it for me, though, was seeing a 10-11 year old girl running around slashing off people's body parts. That got to be a bit much for my taste and I began to wonder for whom that kind of stuff didn't bother? Once again, does our society have a bit of a violence fetish, one that has gotten so bad that watching children tear people to shreds is OK? I think the reason for the rating has more to do with a popular trend in movies (especially comic book movies) nowadays than it does with serving this particular story. With the success of ""Deadpool"" last year, film studios realized that an R-rated super hero film is not only possible, but profitable. But as Malcolm hinted at in the movie ""Jurassic Park"", just because you CAN do a thing doesn't mean that you SHOULD. For ""Deadpool"" it works. You can't do ""Deadpool"" without all that R-rated stuff. That is who ""Deadpool"" is and that's fine. With Wolverine, however, he's already been established throughout the previous 8 X-Men films. All of these R-rated ""upgrades"" now don't make a whole lot of sense.When I read positive reviews for this film, the main point that is made is how good the dramatic performances are, especially from the two leads, Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman. In this case, I completely agree. They did a fantastic job. Even the little girl was amazing, I thought. That can be quite a rarity when you think about how hit and miss child actors are. However, even though most of the performances here are top notch, great performances do not a great film make. If the story sucks, what does it matter? It is hard for me to imagine why Patrick Stewart or Hugh Jackman would be excited to work on a project like ""Logan"" once they read the script. Were they excited to basically negate all of the great work they did (and others did) in the previous X-Men films? They, better than anyone else, should understand what this whole series has been about since the beginning. Yes, ""Logan"" is unique and absolutely gave these actors something different to do with their characters. And yes, they gave stellar performances. However, there needs to be at least a little bit of respect for the source material (and its fans) than this. Much like the season premier of ""The Walking Dead"" this past fall, this seemed more like a kick in the pants for viewers than anything else."
"The final outing of Wolverine by Hugh Jackman is one unforgettable ride and one of the best comic-book movies in recent memory. Directed by James Mangold-who was also at the helm of ""The Wolverine"" (2013)- Logan creates a character-driven, violent and emotional film, which benefits from its rated-r rating. The acting, action and story of Logan are one-of-a-kinds in the superhero genre, as the cast, headed by Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and newly- introduced Dafne Keen, play their characters to the fullest. It is unlike any other X-Men film, definitely the best in the series and deserves the praise it's getting.When I saw the first trailer drop, headlined by Johnny Cash's ""Hurt"", I instantly knew we would be getting something different from everything else that has dropped since the first X-Men film in 2000. The brutality and intensity of the characters pay off in this almost two-and-a- half hour that redefines the superhero genre, and I hope pays dividends for future movies to come. The introduction of X-23 was a big win as well. She is played by Dafne Keen, and though doesn't say much, plays her role very well. Her connection with both Hugh and Patrick creates a family-orientated environment that makes the movie a whole lot better, especially seen in certain scenes.Lastly, as much as I want the character of Wolverine to continue being played on the big screen, it would be better for everyone if they didn't re-cast the role, as no-one would be able to play the role much like the legendary Hugh Jackman. Overall, Mangold and the cast, create a masterfully orchestrated film that will be remembered for years to come. Not only is it a great film, but it is the last time we will be able to appreciate and witness Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart in the X-Men universe."
"Without question, this was Hugh Jackman's movie, from start to finish. No matter how you view it, or who the mantle is passed onto next, Jackman will forever be Wolverine, and this film proves it once and for all. Logan dives deep into the hearts of its viewers, twisting and turning until every emotional string is pulled, and in the end, delivers a superhero film like no other before it; a perfect swan song.Logan heavily, and fittingly, borrows from Marvel's iconic 'Old Man Logan' comic to tell the story of a grim and desolate future, where mutant-kind is all but extinct. Director/writer James Mangold was finally given all the tools necessary to tell a truly compelling Wolverine story, and arguably the biggest tool in the box was the 'R' rating. It pushes the film into an extremely dark and forbidding tone, which helps carve the movie into one of immense intensity and emotion. The 'R' rating, of course, also allows for studious amounts of gore and profanity, but those elements don't feel like they were added just because they could be, they only added to the atmosphere Mangold created for this film, and in turn helps set the narrative to be nothing short of enthralling. The pacing is spot on, the dialogue is stellar and the emotional weight is that of a moving mountain. I applaud Mangold for his brilliant writing, and subsequent directing, as he was at last able to produce the Wolverine story every fan has been craving for the last 17 years, one of raw emotion, brutality and pure magnificence.Hugh Jackman has devoted the last 17 years of his career to this beloved character, and now, he leaves it all on the table, giving the performance of a lifetime, one which could seriously garner some looks at an Oscar nomination. The writing of the characters, Wolverine specifically, stand out the most in the gritty setting, because few superhero movies have ever done what Logan is able to do; make the characters vulnerable, make them real and to make you truly care like never before. Wolverine is worn down and beaten, looking for a way out, and Hugh Jackman gives you every reason to want to feel for his character. His action scenes are nothing short of powerful, none more than his final, and the emotion he displays in every aspect is worthy of an award-winning performance. I genuinely cannot express my praise for Jackman enough, he gave it is all.Wolverine is accompanied by two spectacular supporting characters for most of the film in franchise favorite Professor X and the ferocious X-23. Both characters add tremendous layers of depth to both Wolverine and the film as a whole, with exceptional performances from Patrick Stewart and youngster Dafne Keen, who's X- 23 is an absolute showstopper. The main villain, Pierce, isn't anything too special, but doesn't have to be in a story like this. The core cast of Wolvie, Professor X and X-23 are what drive the film and the performances by their respective actors are outstanding. The father figure that Professor X is to Wolverine and the subsequent father that Wolverine is to X-23 is a deep, touching addition to their characters. This is no-doubt a character driven film, and with Wolverine in the driver's seat, and a pair of dynamite supporting characters, the ability to connect with these characters is real, and that is a treasure few superhero films have ever held.The film's action is gloriously vicious, showcasing what a hacking from Wolverine or X-23 would actually look like. But it's not just the heavy amounts of gore that make the action so amazing, it's again the feeling that these characters are in true danger and every move they make could cost them their lives, none more than Wolverine himself, whose reduced healing factor forces him into a different mindset that, outside of briefly in ""The Wolverine"", we've never seen before. He's not invincible, and even with X-23's relentless attacks, he still has to play his cards differently, and it translates into an emotional roller coaster. All together the action sequences and sheer amount of violence were a sight to behold, entertaining and fierce.17 years it has been, since we first watched a young Hugh Jackman don his X-Men suit. 17 years of stories, character development, action, hardship, humor and emotion, come together to deliver one final journey. The final scene alone may move you to tears, as Hugh Jackman's time as the iconic Wolverine comes to an end. One final epic masterpiece of superhero cinema; Logan.10/10"
"For decades now, we have been clamoring for a 'Wolverine' film done right. From his first incarnation in Hulk #181 to his own miniseries in comic book form in the 1980's by Frank Miller, to the amazing Saturday Morning Cartoon, and his first appearance in a feature film in 2000 with 'X-Men', which had the song and dance man Hugh Jackman play the iconic character. He was so good at playing Logan/Wolverine, that fans immediately took a liking to him as that character and he went on to play the 'Snikt-y Snikt' character in almost a dozen more films. Besides the 'X-Men' films, Wolverine got his own set of standalone films, which may or may not have been liked by a lot of people for various reasons. Either the story was too silly or the character Wolverine was to PG for fans.If anyone knows the Wolverine character, it's that he's a brutal, violent, hardcore rated R character, which is something we haven't seen in cinema form at least. That is until now with James Mangold's new film 'Logan', which is very much an R-rated movie, complete with blood, ultra-violence, nudity, and vulgar language. It's everything we've always wanted in a Wolverine movie – FINALLY! With the past three X-Men films, we've seen our favorite X-Men characters growing up as it served as the prequel to the 2000 film. 'LOGAN' is set in the year 2029 and the world has changed for the worst, at least for a mutant friends. This is a very bleak, dark, and violent film with some flashes of dark humor. Nobody is doing well in 2029 here, particularly Logan (Hugh Jackman) who has crawled inside a whisky bottle and has never came back out, with the exception of driving a limo for cash around town. He's old, mean, and his body is starting to fail him. When he's not driving or killing people, he takes care of Charles Xavier (Sir Patrick Stewart), who is suffering from seizures and dementia, and who lives in a rusted out, abandoned water tower. Life is not good here for anyone.Meanwhile, a little girl named Laura (Dafne Keen) crosses paths with Logan who seems to have the same abilities as the Wolverine himself. Logan is now charged with the task of transporting this little girl to a safe haven with Charles in tow, as a group of bad guys are after her, led by Dr. Zander Rice (Richard E. Grant). It's a fairly straight forward story and it takes its time setting up these older, dying characters, as well as its new ones. 'LOGAN' doesn't mess about with side tangent plot lines or love interests here. It's balls-to-the-wall, heart breaking action and drama, which is something we've wanted for a long time now with the Wolverine character. The script is written by Scott Frank ('Get Shorty, 'Minority Report') and Michael Green ('Heroes', 'Gotham'), which these two writers have expertly added in a fair dose of emotion into these characters, but never back pedal into past films. It was a breath of fresh air. James Mangold certainly was influenced by some of his favorite old western films, as can be seen in some of camera shots, which are just fantastic.Also, if you ever wanted to see Wolverine go berserk, you'll finally get that here on more than one occasion, complete with some long shots of Wolverine slicing and dicing the bad guys without any cuts. Simply amazing. In the past films, we've seen the characters Professor Xavier and Wolverine rather smart, witty, and put together for the most part. That's not the case here. These two characters are very sick and are not doing well mentally and physically. Jackman and Stewart give award worthy performances here, which might bring a tear or two down your face. It's that good. Newcomer Dafne Keen as Laura was also fantastic and very believable in every second she's on film. 'LOGAN' runs at about 135 minutes, which can seem a bit long, but everything is necessary here and for good reason. 'LOGAN' is the Wolverine film we've always wanted and it deserves some high recognition."
"Everything has the beginning and the end.X-Men's movies allocated much screen time to the Wolverine earlier, but they really could not reveal the character. The late solo movies about this hero only aggravated a situation, because they not only contradicted the main franchise, but even each other.This movie tries to tell a story not of the hero who is masked, but the person behind this mask. And it is done."
"What happens when superheroes get old is the main and interesting question this movie answers. It's a question when you think of when you place superheroes in the real world. Logan is a great movie and I think one of the best superhero movies ever made. The movie so adult in its approach that I think even youngsters who read the comics will learn to grow into. The script, the action, the acting is all great and goes to show that you don't need over the top action and effects to tell a great story. This movie gave me what I wanted...a movie. Something you can watch, be taken away and talk about hours after you watch it. And you don't have to know anything about the mythology of the Xmen to enjoy this film.This movie has heart and is directed wonderfully by James Mangold. Hugh Jackman's final performance as Wolverine is his best performance to date because of the range of emotions he has to go through in this film. Great film, highly recommended."
"SPOILER: Did we need another X-Men movie? In fact did we need another Wolverine movie? Well the result is there for all to see, with Logan not only showing itself to be undoubtedly the best Wolverine venture by far, but arguably the best X-Men picture as well. If, as expected (and surely to god it's hoped so), this is the last we see of the grumpy metal clawed superhero, then what a fitting and triumphant bow out it is.James Mangold, the director, has managed to create an adult superhero movie without it really being a superhero pic, for he has created a film noir Western that happens to be about a superhero. Mangold's love of noir and Westerns bursts from the screen, which for those who follow those wonderful stands of cinema, will come as no surprise having seen with notice his Copland and 3:10 To Yuma redux. There's a perpetual grimness to the narrative that belies the quite often stunning surrounding locales, heavy themes such as men out of time - with destinies written (cue a deft comic book movie within a comic book chunk of metaphysics) - surrogates, mental illness, human ignorance, and on it goes, the narrative strong on intelligence as much as it is in wrought emotion. Western fans will also be buoyed by the part that the 1953 classic Western Shane has to play in things, considerably so as its importance narratively, orally and visually is mightily strong.Logan's Run!Ah yes, well being ""adult"" is all well and good, but is Logan thrilling? Do we get pumped up Wolverine action, blood brains, splatter and mucho muscle flexing and pained roars of anger? Oh yes! Action from the off is never far away, and wonderfully staged and choreographed it is. Lots of memorable set-pieces, while also some cleverly constructed sequences such as Xavier's mind seizures hold court and enthral. Yet the kicker with all that is we are clued in to the emotional baggage that the side-burn sporting protag carries with him. With each fight we sense the bigger picture, even as we watch in awe the emergence of Laura (ironic film noir name right there as it happens) - and her part in this very ""human"" story - the thrills and spills are propelled by a meaningful but battered heart.Tech credits are superb. Acting honours go to Jackman, who after giving 17 years of his life to the character, gives it his all and this multi faceted performance, in a perfect world, deserves Oscar recognition. Patrick Stewart, also, is immense, playing the nonagenarian Charles Xavier with such class, gracefulness and storming emotion that one can only admire. Film debutante Dafne Keen as Laura is utterly engrossing, quite a debut indeed, whilst Stephen Merchant as albino mutant tracker Caliban is effective to the point we hanker for more. Although the villains fronted by Boyd Holbrook (rote henchman leader) and Richard E. Grant (smarmy scientist git) just about pass muster, there's nothing to damage the piece. Cinematography (John Mathieson) is ""A"" grade, the filters set on neo-noir, with the splendid film noir black and white version a fillip for the heart of noir lovers. All that is left is for the sound mix to boom and the director to steer with heart, brain and soul, without doubt both come up trumps.One of 2017s best films, a genre splicer that ticks all the boxes of great film making. 10/10"
"I do not understand the reviews... What the heck? This movie was maybe not worth 1 star, I agree, because I enjoyed the brutality to some extent. But it falls very short of being the sort of masterpiece it is made out to be. I chose to rate it 5.First of all, I am not a fan of Wolverine but I've always admitted that Hugh Jackman was made for this role. And his role in pretty much every X-men movie so far was outstanding. He is the Wolverine.In this movie however, he bored me out of my soul. Even in the brutal scenes he played in, I was not convinced. I understand he is weak and old, and ravaged by Adamantium. But even so, it was not him. He kept whining and suffering and yet I felt nothing. I felt like a narrator who remains as distant as his character as he can. It was cold acting--I do not like cheesy actors either but he clearly left me unaffected. Too bad for a movie that relies on emotion to try and stand out.Now on to the girl. I felt no emotion whatsoever for her either. There was no emotional build-up or any anchorage point I could tie my heart with. She was a dull character. The way she growled and made faces was overdone and... ridiculous. Her role was blurry. She begins as a beast bent on savagery and blood. And a few days later she calls Wolverine ""dad""? And she actually has friends waiting for her? Let me have a laugh, I almost fell out of my chair. Several other people summarized her role in action parts; she goes on a killing spree for the first heated scene but at the end of the movie she cannot handle a small troop with her mutant friends--who make the cut by boasting their powers against a man already down and apprehended while she and Wolvie eat dust. ??? Charles-Xavier's lines were bland but at times I was almost convinced. If it wasn't for the unlikable character that the little beast is I'm sure his words would have affected me more. His death was not even moving--and God knows how much I love Charles Xavier.The black family was forgettable. Nothing with them engaged my attention. Except the fact they served as a redemption for a Wolverine that had given up on standing for what it is to be an x-men. And even so he failed. Because of a plot twist character who was there for the sake of adding more Jackman for fan service.But most of all... What happened? For the whole movie I craved some flashbacks, some relevant explanation for Caliban, Xavier, the disappearance of the other X-men, for Wolvie degrading so much, for his copy's reason to exist--why not copy much more powerful mutants that must have been out there. My head was dizzy with lack of information and all it got was a few sentences.I am honestly quite the easy-going guy. I was not full of expectations prior to the movie. I actually expected the movie to be bad so that I could be less critical or hyped up. I wanted to avoid being disappointed. And while the beginning looked promising, it just went downhill when I felt my questions were poorly resolved, or when the girl's incoherent role showed more and more.Perhaps the unmemorable soundtrack played its part, perhaps the questions I kept asking myself and the writing inconsistency spoiled my appreciation of the movie. But so it happened and whereas I know the movie tried hard to be emotional and do Wolverine justice, it actually did the opposite.In a movie in which all I can remember are screams and growls and bloodshed a la Tarantino, Hugh Jackman's last role as the Wolverine is forgettable and painful."
"Exhilarating, visceral and brutal, the last installment in the X-franchise is filled with enough action and nostalgia to satisfy not only fans, but audiences in general, making it a more than a worthy farewell to Jackman's relate and memorable character."
"The movie started off well, with Prof X jailed and drugged in a DIY hideout maintained by Wolvie and Caliban. Pierce is a great villain, but there's no payoff with his abilities or menace. He's simply the foreman for the evil corporation that is growing test tube mutants and hunting them down. Besides having one robotic hand, him or his Reavers don't really have any glaring cybernetic advantages. It would have been interesting to see different types of cyborg Reavers as in the comics, but in this movie, they are simply claw fodder.Once the introduction of Wolvie's clone begins, the movie goes downhill. We know nothing as to how or why this clone suddenly appears. Why wouldn't there be clones of all the X-Men at this point? Wasn't it already proved in the most awful of its series, Terminator Genisys, that Arnold vs Younger Arnold is not that captivating? Why would it work in this movie? Why not make Pierce a more capable and challenging villain?Once the Prof is whacked, as well as the kind family that sheltered them, I really began to lose interest. What's the point of heroes if they can't protect the good and innocent? The ending made no sense. At the beginning, Lara takes on 20+ Reavers on her own. After being reunited with 10+ other powerful, trained killer mutant kids, they are running away and being captured by the same number of Reavers? It makes NO SENSE. I'm CONVINCED that the movie critic industry is PAID or compensated in some way by the studios to produce positive reviews to DUPE, bait and switch audiences all for $$$ because this movie is currently 77 on Metacritic when it should be a 37. Good violence, poor writing, sloppy ending is what you really get.Its truly sad that a Wolverine movie has yet to be made well. Will never watch another movie by Mangold ever again. Learned my lesson. Save your $ and wait til this streams. Trust me, you'll thank me later. This is also part of the reason why IMDb shut down their message boards. Not to silence the haters, but to silence the voices of critical yet honest reviewers that ultimately hurts the $ of the movie industry."
"Being a huge X-Men fan, I really hoped this movie would be good and all of the trailers looked amazing, so I went into the cinema with impossibly high hopes, even preparing myself for tears. What I got, however, was an actual punch in the stomach and, like, an hour of crying. This movie exceeded every hope I ever had entering the cinema.I'm actually having a hard time finding any negatives in this movie whatsoever. I wasn't particularly crazy about Dr Rice, but he's such a minor presence in this movie that I barely even noticed him. There are several villains in this movie, Dr Rice, Donald Pierce and X-24, but what I genuinely believe is going fairly unnoticed in all of the reviews I've read is Donald Pierce and Boyd Holbrook's portrayal of him. Honestly, I don't believe we've had such a good X-Men villain since Magneto, and that to me is really important now since we barely get any good villains in movies these days. Villains can be the most interesting part of a movie. I'm excited to watch Boyd's show ""Narcos"" now, and I plan on following his career from this moment on. X-24 is also a much better villain than I expected, serving as a sort of a shadow to Wolverine. Another highlight of the movie was Dafne Keen, the little girl that plays Laura. She is absolutely amazing, and I can't stress that enough. I want to briefly discuss the R rating. Honestly, it adds so much to the movie, and it's amazing to finally see Wolverine cut loose, swearing and slicing people up, it's amazing. And there is a lot of blood and swearing in this movie, which just adds on to this gloomy, gritty feel that lingers over this entire film, further pushing the notion that the dream is dead, that this is the end of the X-Men. It's truly depressing seeing this world where all of your childhood heroes are dead. In a way, I'm almost angry with the creators for twisting the X-Men so out of what we're used to, and that's another thing that I sort of have a problem with, even though nothing really could have been done about it. I don't really feel like the message of this movie, to give up after so many years of fighting, to just kill off everything goofy and colorful about the X-Men and shatter all of our hopes is necessary in a time like this. I think that as goofy as they are, X- Men movies and superhero movies in general just need to do what they were created to do - to raise hope in people that things will get better if we all work together and that we can find a family no matter how different we are. That's an important part as to why X-Men were created in the first place, to show minorities that they're not alone. Now we have a movie that shows mutants, a minority already hated by most of the ""normal"" people being killed off by the government, and I really don't think that's the message that was needed right now. However, ""Logan"" is a typical example of the director giving the audience what they want (a nostalgic, gritty Wolverine road trip movie) instead of what they need. In this case, it absolutely works because everything is so masterfully crafted, the cinematography is beautiful, the performances are amazing (Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman should seriously be up for an Oscar), the action, gore and script are ridiculously good, there is a compelling villain and it managed to hit an emotional nerve for me. I can't even consider giving it a lower than perfect score. I'm excited to see what Logan means for the superhero genre. It's definitely up there with the likes of ""The Dark Knight"". However, this movie can stand alone as something more than ""just a superhero film"", and as I've heard so many times before, superhero movies get old. It's time for a little change in the genre. While I can't say I'm particularly happy with the implied direction that the X-Men movies are taking after ""Apocalypse"" (even though the X-Men are my favorite superhero group ever, though people tend to forget all about comic books and animated series), I'm more than excited to see if they will ever again reach anything close to the masterpiece that is ""Logan""."
"Acting and CGI was great, even the story was great too.But the HUGE, HUGE, HUGEEEE plot holes killed it for me, making the film unbearable to watch.*spoilers*1. Why did Logan not kill the Dr, the clone, and Donald Pierce while they were laying defenseless and half dead at the farm?2. Why did the black farmer attempt to kill Logan after killing the shaved clone Logan? Logan was clearly standing in a non-aggressive manner and even let himself get shot without saying a word???3. How did Charles Xaivier not detect that the Logan clone was not a mutant or not human? His power is to read minds and detect life... How didn't he realize a robot has just walked into the room and sense he was about to be killed???4. The year is 2029 and the army has not developed the technology to capture kids safely? Hell even a net gun or taser would have worked better than tackling the kids? WTF. They even had harpoon guns that do not kill and they didn't use them on the kids, instead they just chase them through the forrest...5. In the final scenes the children take turns using their power on Donald Pierce (just to make a cool montage), while Logan and Laura battle to death with the clone??6. The children are trained to kill and have no fear, yet they run away (from no one) while letting Logan fight the clone alone? They were 20 to 1 and they decide that it's time to run?7. Even though they were so pressed for time and had no time to save Logan, they make the time to have a burial for him? Also what the hell is with the cross they made? Were they taught religion while in killing school? Seems legit.SO yeah these points infuriated me.. Feel free to comment and rebuttal my points as I am keen to find out how nobody else is seeing these loopholes..."
"If you want to find intelligent people who are actually capable of reviewing a movie, then you have those here who have voted miserably for this movie The movie is full of errors and the story line is extremely predictable Following are some of the issues I found 1) Majority of the movie is cliché, you have a failing superhero, his ailing mentor and a young prodigy in a journey to save the young one. The mentor is taken out by the villain, makes the superhero very angry who in the end sacrifices himself, killing the villain and the young one goes free into an unclear future. Any person should be able to predict the ending of the movie after just watching 10 minutes of the start and here are people comparing this with the Dark Knight!!!! Unbelievable!!!! 2) The prey seems to be running after the predator in the movie. The kids with superpowers are already trained as shown in the movie. They are not poor scared souls, they are lethal, mentally and physically. You can see glimpses of that during the end, when they kill off the mercenaries ruthlessly. With their unique powers combined, its a surprise they were even once contained in a facility. Sometimes you can see the kinds wimping and crying and few moments later they freeze someone off or electrocute someone without remorse. 3) Logan witnesses a group of drones towards the end which makes him realize that the kids are in danger. Why on earth would a dozen surveillance drones move around in a bunch? Shouldn't they be spread out to do their job better or was their job to get noticed by wolverine 4) X-24 was shot by an adamantium bullet in the end which blew half his head off. When wolverine was shot by that bullet in X Men Origins he only lost his memory, another inconsistency. 5) Professor X knew well that they had a vicious mercenary group hell bent after them. Why on Earth would he then suggest that they spend the night at the Munsons'? That's the most stupid thing to do. Oh yes now I get it why, its so that the mutant wolverine can be introduced in the movie and it was the perfect time for him to die. Killed by someone who he thought was Logan, that's sure to get a lot of sympathy right there. 6)Logan clearly knows that they are supposed to keep a low profile, in spite of that he picks up a fight with the Reavers 7) The producers had this project nicely figured out. Kill Wolverine, kill professor X, earn a lot of sympathy and thereby earn a lot of money. Also keep a bunch of mutant kids alive so that in case they fall short of lunch money, well you know what they will be working on. There are scores of mistakes with the story line but I do not wish to waste any more of my time so my advice for those who haven't watched this movie yet, don't."
"I just finished watching Logan and--oh my God--what a dismal, dreary, dreadful and dumb bit of cinematic nihilism that was. Brutally and graphically and disturbingly violent too.All those tremendous adventures the X-Men had in years past? All the times they defeated evil villains? The camaraderie, the sense of family--of a home for misfit mutant kids? The risks and victories and sacrifices? Yeah, it was all ultimately meaningless.I can understand if they felt they needed to kill off the old X-Men but they did so in such a way as to make every previous X-Men movie and story appear to have been a foolish exercise in futility. A miserable and lonely future awaits, addled and alcoholic, only to be relieved by violent death. Yay.This could have been an uplifting homage to the ideal of what the X-Men were. But Hugh & Patrick & Co. apparently decided they would rather go out with a sad whimper instead of a celebratory bang."
"Warning Warning Warning Warning The review contains spoilers!!!!! The review contains spoilers!!!!! The review contains spoilers!!!!! The review contains spoilers!!!!!-------------------- This review contains spoilers RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING --------- ---A completely morbid and joyless film. Grim and hopeless to the point to depravity! The ignominious death fashioned for Charles Xavier is unworthy -- given the legacy of this character. Equally distasteful are the not so subtle suggestions that this film or its characters are comparable to Shane. This self-service association is entirely unearned and borders on heresy. You could have done so much better with a modicum of imagination and heart. When I saw the coming attractions it left me feeling miserable. I though ""Who would possible want to see such a grim and hopeless film?"". As an owner of copies of the previous two films and most X-men movies, I went to see it anyway. I left the theater feeling even worse than I did after viewing the coming attractions.The rating of 3 out of 10 rather than 2 out of 10 is for the visceral depiction of the effects of Professor X's 'brainstorm' That part was very well doneAside from that, thanks for nothing guys. Eat soup and cough!"
"The best X-Men film alongside First Class. It felt gritty, it felt real with a sense of dread and hopelessness you don't often see in this comic-book blockbuster adaptations. It should be praised for doing things differently and really pushing the edge with what can or can't be done in the genre. The triangle between Logan, Charles and Laura works as the driving force of the plot, and is very well developed. Logan's character arch is quite pleasant to watch, though obviously predictable. With that said, the acting is clearly masterclass. You can feel the dilemmas, the emotions and feelings that the characters are put through, specially those three. And another thing it does really well is alluding to a previous event - the Charles incident - but never fully explaining it to the audience, leaving you wondering. The action is nothing like you'd expect from a tenthpole - the R rating really makes up for wonders - being quite visceral and impactful. ""Logan"" probably deserved a better villain, although one could argue that the real villain here is not the typical multinational corporation, but the inner demons of the characters. Demons that prevent them from living albeit normal and somewhat stable life."
"Mindbogglingly bad film. I can't believe there are so many people saying lyrical things about it. Is this really what substitutes a good film in the year 2017? Come on.The story is just so stupid and totally full of holes, right from the get go. Scene 1: Logan is sleeping it off in his fancy limo when he is woken by some Latino guys that are trying to steal his rims. The car is jacked up and we clearly see them loosening the nuts of one of the tires. Logan slashes them up, removes the jack and then drives off real fast. Eh... what about that loose tire? And so on, stupidity after stupidity, through the whole film!There are people praising the characters. The characters, really? A bunch of morons completely and frustratingly unable to communicate with each other, unable to make any logical or reasonable decisions, and so utterly predictable. Charles constantly (more or less subtly) telling Logan that he is a stupid and unloved oaf, is that like peoples idea of cinematic tension between characters, showing profound depths of humanity? Seriously, tripe.And the action... I mean honestly, after like the 10th goon has had his eyes poked out by Logan or mini-girly-Spanish-I-can-suddenly-speak- English-where-the-h**l-did-I-learn-that-Logan it's not really that fascinating. Oh look, the spikes can come out through this side of the skull too, whey! Yes, a lot of people do get killed, slashed, maimed, decapitated, etc. in this film, but that does not make it great. Not by a long shot.There is seriously nothing great about this film. So just avoid it. Or watch it and waste a couple of hours of your life like I did of mine."
"I created an IMDb account solely for the purpose of reviewing this movie and to give it a more honest and accurate rating. It says it has an 8.5 rating, but really it should be more like a 1 or 1.5, seriously. What happened to people? Is this really the standard for a good movie nowadays? I will spare you the suffering of going into great detail about every little flaw in this movie. With that said, here are some of the reasons why this movie sucks:1. No explanation of the events that have transpired to get to this point. Logan has apparently decided to become a limo driver to make money so that he and Charles can go live on a boat somewhere in the middle of the ocean? Really? And what happened to the other mutants? Supposedly there was some kind of ""event"" that I guess killed off all the mutants and also stopped them from breeding more mutants. It's hard to say because the movie makes no attempt to clue you in on what has happened.2. No plot. Besides being lost from the very beginning, nothing really happens throughout the entire movie to progress the story. Logan just drives this little girl and Charles cross country while being chased by some random bad guys who eventually catch up with them -- there's a fight -- more driving -- they get caught again -- rinse and repeat.3. Who is this Wolverine clone? Where did he come from? how was he made? what is he doing here? Want answers? You get none. He's just there.4. Both Charles and Logan die in the most anticlimactic and meaningless ways.The positives:1. Hugh Jackman"
"In a time when Marvel continues to churn out the same superhero film time- and-time again ('Deadpool' and 'Guardians' aside due to their fresh take on the genre), it's refreshing when something as intricate and beautifully- executed as 'Logan' is made. I mean let's face it, that first trailer was a dead giveaway of how damn good it was going to be.I understand that Marvel has made the attempt to build characters through a series of films previously, such as they have tried with the Avengers films, but never have I seen a film that treats character development as seriously, and pulls it off with such precision, as they did here in 'Logan', a film that focuses more on the ""humane"" aspect of the character and how vulnerable he is as a superhero, instead of the over-the-top execution that's usually featured ('X-Men Origins' I'm looking at you).Two characters that we've come to know and love, James ""Wolverine"" Howlett (aka Logan) and Charles ""Professor X"" Xavier, are put to the test of time as we see them in their new state, once characters that resembled strength and power, are now withering and vulnerable. And the gut-punching, adrenaline- pumping action has been swapped out for slow-moving, emotional drama and character development. Does it work? You bet! From start to finish we are led on a journey of discovery and empathy, with James Mangold more than making up for his previous effort that is 'The Wolverine'.I think it's the uncertainty throughout that gives the film that powerful punch. In the other X-Men films (and most other Marvel films for that), we are faced with a plethora of superheroes each fighting a seemingly impossible army, but no matter what, there is always a general feeling that the good guys will win, and this usually happens. So when attending a superhero film, you sit back in ease, knowing the protagonists will succeed, however in 'Logan' that never happens, there is never that sense of safety, we can't be certain of their outcomes. Every step of the way, Wolverine looks tired, he looks sick, he's dying gradually, and due to his weakened form, we are left worrying for the character, there is that emotional attachment that most other superhero films lack. This is the harrowing truth throughout, we are emotionally-concerned from start to finish.With utterly stunning cinematography, a hard-hitting score, fantastic direction and a superhero performance that might just be the first Oscar- deserving one ever. Wolverine's outing makes for the best Marvel film to date, a gritty and vulnerable adventure into the vulnerability of superheroes."
"This is highly overrated. This is nowhere near as good as critics say it is. 1 star for the little girl.The X-MEN series has always been filled with continuity errors. The first 3 movies were pretty consistent. Then there were prequels telling stories that contradict the old trilogy. Hey! Remember Mystique? She is said to be of the same age with Charles Xavier in the prequels, whereas in the old trilogy, well...Also, the franchise has never been consistent in style. Most of the previous X-MEN movies are PG-13, quite typical for Marvel movies. This time it is R. However, there is not much difference, only more blood but not by much.The story does not make sense here and there. For example, had they shot the enemy instead of keeping him alive and attempting to dump him in the middle of nowhere, they could have avoided a lot of trouble later on. The Wolverine died saving a bunch of little mutant shitheads nobody cares about, who later on stood over his tomb, exchanging weird glances and as Laura quoted from an old movie, they seemed to be thinking, ""What the F..K is she babbling about?"" Clearly they haven't seen the old movie. Not to mention that the whole ""Save Laura"" Operation was based on a nurse who read lots of comic books. Who wrote the books?The movie educates us: 1. Never let the enemy off easily. 2. Never trust the comic books."
"I think that ""Alkali research"" might have put a ""pathogen"" in the water that has prevented the birth of sane, critically thinking movie goers for the last 25 years. Or it might just be the fact that Hollywood produces turd after turd and that has lowered our expectations. Either way, the sad reality remains, a simple and unspectacular movie like Logan gets a 8.5.The movie begins at a somewhat slow pace. The more it progresses, the more it starts to get evident that we're not going to be seeing decent special effects. This was produced on the ""cheap"" and has a TV series feel to it. The execution and the sheer scale are not up to par with the other X-men movies, the script is lacking too. The worse part however is that this movie is supposed to give the whole X-men series closure and it does that in a very unspectacular and boring way. They rushed it, probably seeing a good opportunity to slaughter the dying cash-cow, seeing that Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart wanted to retire from playing their iconic X-man characters.A big disappointment and a sad ending to an otherwise decent franchise. Can't wrap my mind around the 8.5 mark, I guess a good part of the budget went for paying up the shills."
"James Mangold wrote and directed Logan things became depressing quickly and set the tone for the rest of the movie. This film should be titled kill kill and die. Or ""Sick Wolverine"" I find it hard to believe so many liked this movie, or worse thought it was great.I don't care for sick wolverine, it makes no sense the adamantium was poisoning him, and I think it was the genetic stuff in foods, that made the mutants unable to reproduce, and also for them to die of some ailment. Wolverines healing power fought it but was losing. But really this is not a good story and ruined the movie for me, I would rather see a normal wolverine one last time than to see this travesty. And if they are going to kill him then so be it, but I don't really like that either. When a actor is saying one more time, they tend to think O lets kill him off then. I don't like that,The girl Laura was the best thing in the movie, was his DNA daughter, and she looked like fameke Jansen who played jean so they could have said she had DNA from jean too. played superbly by the young Dafne Keen. She never speaks thru half the movie, so does it all with looks etc. And they could have ended it with Logan going to Canada with his new daughter, and the other kids, and starting a school like Xavier did in past. That would have been a better ending that this crap.Basically everyone in movie dies, except few of the kids, and cant remember if any of the bad guys survived, like the geneticist? Even the family that helped them all died, kill kill kill, not a happy movie at all, just the opposite, very dark and depressing movie with a few light moments that were quickly squashed by something bad.I did really like the character growth between Logan and the girl, which might be one of the main highlights of the movie's story for me.I would only watch this again to see the Laura scenes, but it is so depressing I don't know if I ever will want to watch this again.The main villains of the film are very one-dimensional; at times, the film almost goes deep into their motivations, but abruptly interrupts itself in lieu of more awesome fight scenes. Basically you have a bunch of guys with guns, but they don't use the guns or do so rarely. The main bad guy just seemed not bad, like a robot doing a job. The geneticist was a little better but seemed to come out of nowhere in middle of movie, and was kind of corny.I gave it a 2 of 10 and I have always liked wolverine and the actor playing the part. The writing and story was awful except for Logan's daughter, take that and write a better story, and it could have been a great movie.Aside from Laura, this story really sucked, the worst of all the wolverine movies.It was R rated so they could show graphic violence and I like that, but combined with the depressing story makes it harder to watch.So Logan winds up buried in some woods, and Prof X buried some unmarked grave too, and everyone says yeah it was great and fitting ending for these 2 characters lol.O and having Prof X be sick like he was sort of ruined having him in the movie too, and not good to remember him by. I guess I am just an oddball for not liking it, or people who don't like it probably don't want to take the time to come here and do a review, just the fanboys that loved it."
"The high ratings for this film are based entirely on its sombre tone. That's a great novelty in a 'superhero' movie, to be sure. But it merely masks the film's emptiness - its painful lack of ideas, lack of character development, and total absence of plot.Jackman's performance? As someone once quipped, his emotional range runs the full gamut... from A to B. He looks grumpy and depressed in every scene. In every shot. Patrick Stewart is somewhat more nuanced, though he too is hamstrung by a script that gives his character the emotional depth of a cartoon. Dafne Keen does a great job as Laura, but her character has only attitude - which incompetent screen writers often mistake for character.Visually, the film is bland. I hear there's a black-and-white version. It's always a bad sign when a film's creators can't make up their minds on such a key issue. A film is either shot for B&W, or it isn't. (In the case of Logan, the photography lacks the dramatic contrasts and strong composition that might favor a noir-ish B&W presentation.)Logic holes abound:* After being raised in a cage, Laura turns out to be a competent driver. What's more, she has no trouble reaching the pedals, presumably on account of some stretching power that's not mentioned elsewhere in the film.* Laura is mute for half the film, for no apparent reason. Then she can only speak Spanish. Then fluent English. No explanation.* Laura is often feral, as you'd expect of someone raised in a cage by sadistic scientists. Yet she acts like a normal child most of the time. Ditto for her friends. This quality does not 'develop' as a result of events in the film - it simply materializes when needed.* Laura drives at random, ends up at a completely out-of-the-way building. And meets all her friends. When was this arranged? How did she learn navigation while locked in a cage?* Logan and Laura have a cozy evening with a nice family - knowing full well that they're setting them up for slaughter, when their pursuers come along. The audience knows this instantly, characters in the film don't quite get it.* Logan is dying, we're never told why. Professor X has a brain-cloud, or some such dread condition, also not explained.Missed opportunities are equally plentiful:* Laura's feral attacks are mentioned in conversation, but never really discussed. Logan dismisses them with a couple of heavy one-liners, when they could have (and should have) led to an extended rumination on violence. The film doesn't miss a beat when Laura's friends brutally murder the guy with the mechanical hand. This lynch-mob logic should, again, have been a starting point for reflections that never happen in this shallow, trivial film.* Logan never has a character arc. Wolverine actually has far less emotional range in this film than in the first X-Men movie. His relationship with Laura is essentially the same as the far more developed relationship with Rogue.* Characters are neither built up, nor revealed. To do that, you have to show them in a range of different circumstances, dealing with emotionally or morally challenging dilemmas. In Logan, the only dilemma is how to keep eluding inexorable pursuit so as to stretch the film out past the two-hour mark. Hence the only character trait that can be revealed is dogged perseverance. We get that in the first scene. After that, nothing.* Ultimately, the filmmakers resort to having Logan shaved back to his familiar Wolverine muttonchops. You know you're in trouble when you're counting on facial hair to create characterization. (Or fan service.)* Plot is nonexistent. The film is one long chase. Weak screenwriters often mistake this for plot, but it's a poor substitute: totally linear, predictable, boring. Yes, there have been great 'chase' films (Sam Peckinpah's The Getaway comes to mind.) They take care to incorporate twists and turns, and strong moments of characterization. Logan doesn't. It's just a bunch of stuff that happens.On top of everything else, I had the creeping suspicion that this film was calculated less as a standalone work, than as a stepping-stone for the X-Men 'franchise.' It disposes of two performers who've stated their intent to depart the roles they created. And it seems to pave the way for the endlessly-discussed New Mutants franchise. Ugh. Replacing the people won't make up for a lack of ideas, and Logan shows very clearly how bereft of creative thinking the X-Men cinematic franchise has become.I didn't hate Logan as I was watching it. But when it ended I was overcome by a feeling of emptiness and disappointment. This film lacks both entertainment value and deep ideas. The Marvel cinematic universe badly needs a shot of new blood, but sadly, this wasn't it."
"I'm frankly astonished by all the positive reviews, especially those comparing this to ""The Dark knight"". The films tone leans towards edgy rather than dark in my opinion with profuse use of unnecessary cursing making it feel like an 18 year old was hired to spice up the dull plodding nature of each scene. Moments felt like the Coen brothers ""No country for old men"" was lifted whole sale and stitched onto the plot of ""Children of men"" with a smattering of ""Xmen 2"". Not necessarily the worst idea ever, but the execution just leads to a painful and cringe worthy experience. Many moments I found my hands raised in disbelief as mutants forgot they had powers. Antagonists failed to use even a percent of their brain when attacking their non Wolverine targets (""YOU HAVE GUNS SHOOT THEM"" was a message I found on my lips at multiple points in the film). Some scenes were so drawn out if the film hadn't been two and a half hours long I'd think they were playing for time (see: Logan exiting a car, sighting a mountain, seeing a girl, falling over, being winched up a cliff, 15 minutes of information being conveyed extraordinarily slowly (that we already knew and had been told before) the full scene took 20 minutes to end with nothing new being learnt, nothing interesting happening and the plot exactly were it left off). Bad acting is present throughout with the exception of Patrick Stewart and Eriq La Salle. Please do not let Dafne Keen star in any more films until she has been taught finesse and timing. Pacing, CGI (the fence scene is especially noticeable), script and attempts at political finger pointing all hinder this film greatly. The films greatest crime though, the ending. Someone explain to me what a territorial border has to offer against PMC with seemingly limitless funds?"
"With a bit more depth and dramatic flair then its predecessors, this is perhaps one of the best three or four superhero movies ever made, however it really could've explored those depths a bit further and flushed them out. While, I appreciate the effort, those giving this movie a ten , seem a bit enthusiastic about the overall scope of this film. At the same time, I will find it hard to believe, anyone , could in reality bring The Wolverine more to life then Hugh Jackman did, some actors, seem born to play certain roles. Overall? Worth the Watch!"
"The film moves slowly with a poor story line. I almost fell asleep  twice and really do not understand the high scores for a film that  really does not deliver. As I use IMDb as a guide for viewing a film,  this is the first time I have been totally misled by the rating. I  think it is a good thing that the character of Logan has been killed  off, as it will save people like me, wasting time watching such a  totally over rated film."
"This movie takes place in an alternate universe, where somebody (probably Apocalypse) has unleashed a terrible radiation on planet Earth, turning all of its inhabitants into total morons and losers. So, if you're interested in seeing your favorite X-Men heroes totally humiliate themselves and literally act like they are mentally retarded, then go ahead and watch this movie.You will see the incredible X-Men reduced to swearing, bickering, tantrum-throwing teenagers, shopping in an indoor mall, then sitting around in their hotel room and watching crappy reruns on TV. No joke, that all really happens in this movie.As usual, it hurts me very deeply to see my favorite childhood heroes utterly humiliated and destroyed by Hollywood. The underlying message of this movie seems to be that the Age of Heroes is dead. There is no beauty left in the world, no hope, no shining intelligent ideas or dreams. That has all been replaced by shallow, empty scriptwriters and greedy, ruthless movie producers. So watch this movie and say goodbye to your childhood heroes on more time, because (as usual in these terrible X-Men movies) they all die."
"I went in with an expectation of a ""typical"" X-Men movie, without reading the reviews here ... Just saw the ""Star"" ratings. I don't know who these people are give 10 stars, for sure either they had very a very low expectations from this or are paid raters. My problem with this movie is that you cannot take a total fictional Sci-Fi character and put him in a real life situation, where he is a beat up limo driver, fighting the Mexican thugs trying to steel his Limo's ""Chrome plated rims"" ... from the start I lost interest in it, after that it just drags, extra long scenes and not to mention that this movie happened in future, where all the mutants are gone/hunted down, yet no real advancements, people still shooting with 12 gauge shotguns ...There are No Mountain Range North Dakota bordering Canada .... Guys if you wanna make a movie about reality ... it should have some reality for a fictional Character ... It Just Sucked"
"I am a fan of the X-Men movies. They are all fun and exciting to watch. They are also beautiful to see. This is not true for Logan. Sadly.The movie isn't fun, the surroundings are sad. The same for the characters. To see beloved heroes turn into decadent sad characters is awful.They do die has heroes. But very broken ones.Other characters are poorly written.And I got the felling, at the end, that the ""bad guys"" were stronger, even if the mutant children got away. With the death of Logan, they run away into the woods, scared. No teacher left behind to guide them and teach them to manage their abilities and hopefully save the world.No. They are left alone in a dark world. Their hero was a drunken sad Logan, that didn't taught anything positive.Sad, sad, sad. And ugly."
"This movie is depressing and riddled with plot holes and contradictions with generally accepted lore. I didn't realize that this movie is based off of a different range of comics that depict this darker, older bunch of characters and apparently it relates to that range quite well. However most viewers aren't comic connoisseurs and will have their knowledge from the previous movies, the comics and cartoons they were watching as a child and anything that the movie itself would present during its showing. Logan, however, does very little to explain the background of the setting or the characters. The actors do a great job of acting but it's lost on the viewer when you have no idea why things are happening in the movie. If the writers of this movie were focusing on a non standard lore path they should have made damn sure the viewer was more comfortable with the new, and contradicting, environment they're presented with and not assume we've read or even appreciated the alternative story line. There are so many wtf moments when things don't gel in this movie that I can't recommend this to anyone."
"Warning: This review may contain opinions that qualify as spoilers. Rewind to the year 2000 when X-Men finally arrives on the big screen. Logan is a wild animal fighting in a cage for money with no memory of his past. Angry and disgusted with who and what he is he just wants revenge on the world. Enter Professor Xavier and the X-Men. Wolverine finds people who accept him, even like him oddly enough, and someone in the form of Jean Grey in whom he could maybe even find love. Armed with a new found purpose and backed by a family that believes in him Logan changes from a dangerous animal to an invincible super hero worthy of legend.Fast forward to 2017. Logan is a shadow of his former self as is Professor X. There are no more heroes in America. Corporations can do whatever they want. Good people who still believe in heroes or are heroes themselves just by raising a good family with American values will become casualties. There is no stopping an automated future. Your heroes are NOT invincible. Do not look to the next generation for hope. This was not a superhero movie but a dystopian pipe dream.I would have been happier seeing gun toting thugs lined up on either side of Wolverine and 2 hours of him perforating their skulls one at a time. Much more entertaining and save a ton of money on useless writing staff. Could even CGI the whole thing, box office smash.Do not be surprised when Hollywood kills off a few of the Avengers next."
"After countless delays and due to my stupidly swollen watchlist I finally got round to seeing Logan which at time of writing currently sits at #155 on IMDb's Top 250 list.Though never really a fan of the X-Men movies due to the lack of consistency and shifting timelines I've always loved Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. The man has taken the character and made it is own as the likes of Robert Englund did with Freddy and for this reason I hope we don't see Wolverine again as a recast would be a travesty.Due to the high rating, rumours of the film & Jackman claiming this was his last film as Wolverine I went in with very high expectations and truth be told they simply weren't met.Don't get me wrong Logan is a good movie, Jackman is great, Keen is surprisingly competent and the movie flows nicely but it all felt very familiar and rather anti-climatic.Wolverine has become of the most iconic movie characters of the last few decades so if this was destined to be his last film we truly needed something special and I don't believe this comes under that category.Even with fantastic actors like Patrick Stewart, Richard E Grant & Stephen Merchant the movie never came close to reaching its potential and left me more than slightly let down.The ending, arguably the worst part of the film. No spoilers to be found here just wads of disappointment.After 9 films as Wolverine I salute Hugh Jackman for literally becoming a character, all the respect in the world. One does have to wonder if he'd have had as much success if he'd worn the proper Wolverine yellow spandex though!"
"This is the perfect movie treat for fans of the Wolverine character as portrayed by Hugh Jackman in films. Period. I won't argue with that. And you can tell as much by just checking the titles of the ""Five Stars!"" reviews here at IMDb. Yep, it's exactly what this movie is. And by the way I am not a ""fan"" of the Wolverine comic books, I happen to like a few of them from the 80s. So I don't go to the cinema expecting to see a comic book I already have in my shelves. So what did I find in this film? A boring, unoriginal and unimaginative movie, willing to satisfy the appetites of fans left open in prior attempts of the franchise, full of moronic routines I won't bother to list. The occasional comedy moments are jokes based around the walking disability of a character, so expect the laughs to border the derogatory. And the choreographed ""over the top"" slashing violence quickly becomes dull and repetitive. Plus... there is also a lot of violence dispensed to kids, and by kids. Kids are shot, stabbed and kicked -a lot. And in turn the same kids stab back, slash back, electrify and decapitate. Which is creepy if you ask me, as for this alone the film merits to be a horror movie -which it ain't. Last, lots of people are saying the story is based in a comic book series titled OLD MAN LOGAN. OK, please don't. Because in this film (do I need to say... SPOILERS AHEAD?) Wolverine, now Logan, works as a limo driver to make money and buy anti seizure medication for Prof. X and hopes to make enough dough to buy a boat and go live in the middle of the ocean with same Prof. X. Do you find any resemblance in that with the comic book series? I guess not. The only thing in common with OLD MAN LOGAN is that Logan is OLD. End of similarities. Yeah, just skip it I guess."
"As usual with all previous X-men movies i approach to this one with big anticipation, which didn't let me down with previous ones... But with Logan? The movie is one big agony for spectators, as also for the characters playing their agonistic, pathetic roles... Poor plot, no explanation how happened that once mighty Wolverine becomes old, injured, with almost no (or progressive lower) self healing ability, alcoholic... with his final pathetic wish to get on the boat and retreat from the rest of the world, with (even older and more sick) once great head of all mutants Charles Xavier, which also becomes pathetic... And, what happened with other co-Wolverine and Xavier X-men from the past??? Forget about it... Not a word about them... like they never exist...One thing disturbed me particularly; the brutal violence, presented so intense, with so messy-bloody scenes which never seen before in previous movies... Disappointing, that otherwise brilliant Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart accepted the roles in such bad script..."
"I'm so sorry that I went to see this movie, I liked the other x-men movies , but this one was absolutely awful. Who wrote this script was absolutely crazy. The script makes no sense. How the hell all the mutants were extincted? And how so, just 3 mutants were left (professor , wolverine and the fuk white face) There's no explanation about how it's possible that wolverine to be poisoned by the Adamantium. I can't even find the desire to write about this awful movie ! There's no point , they just killed the x-men. Shame on you !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"You might have seen this movie before. Tired and sore Wolverine tries to hide from who he really is. This movie takes us into the future where Logan is more tired, sore and bitter. He drinks and winces from the pain. Then - the plot thickens - the bad guys come. Then Wolverine is asked to help someone and as always he says no and then he helps. Now guess what happens! Yup, bad guys come. Big fight, good guys get away and bad guys keep looking. Good guys meet innocent family and stay for dinner. But of course, the nice people are having difficulties with someone and Logan sends them a running. Classic Shane story line in all but 5 minutes. OK - now guess what happens. Yup - bad guys come. Big fight, people die and good guys get away. Then what happens? Yup - bad guys find good guys and we have a final big fight. And yes - good guys win - well sort off - in that all the bad guys are dead. How the heck did this film get 5/5 and 4/5 stars from my favourite critics. What movie where they watching? I am tired of the same old story line. This was a boring and predicable film. Nothing new here folks. Save your money and buys some tacos."
"Of all the X-Men, X-Men Origin and X-Men prequel movies, this movie is the worst, and separate from that - it is a bad movie, standing alone. Unlike the effective - in (X-Men director) Brian Singer's paraphrased words ""I would want my favorite comic book universe, if made into a movie, to be taken seriously"" - other X-Men movies, this movie is filled with gratuitous violence, bizarre levels of cursing and a one-dimensional villain. I can't even remember the villain's name, that is how forgettable he was. Unlike Magneto or Colonel Striker, who were instantly memorable. We are told the movie takes place in the year 2029, but that makes no sense, since they keep repeating there have been no new mutants born in 25 years. Since 2004. But Prof. X's school was - I quote - taking place in the ""not too distant future"" - and was filled with kids in all the prior movies!!! Which were clearly taking place during, before and after 25 years ago, by any clear judgment. It made no sense. We were informed that Prof. X and Logan were among the last alive, that all the other X-Men from the newly resurrected Jean Grey to Scott. But with no explanation, they are all now dead. The entire pantheon of the X-Men, dead, when in the last movie with them - Days Of Future Past - they were all at the top of their game. We never found out what happened to Rogue - who was alive - or Bobby or even flipping Beast! And for some bizarre, entirely inexplicable reason, in this movie the mighty Wolverine is trying to get by ... as a chauffeur. With a chauffeur's permit and everything. IMPLAUSIBLE, MUCH? This movie is riddled with plot holes like Swiss cheese!!! The movie has a double tragic death ending unbefitting the glory of these excellent characters. What a shame!!!"
"This is my first review even though I have been a member here since late 90's early 2000s. This is due to the fact that I don't understand the love for this movie.This movie stumbles about trying to figure out how to be a road trip movie with a western genre landscape and superhero theme. The result is a pretentious sloppy mess that takes itself too serious while giving very little regard to the films that led to this one.The fans that requested an ""R"" rating did so with the thinking that it would open up the film to be more free with the character. Instead it felt like it was pigeon holed into justifying the R rating from the senseless breast flashing to random F-bombs that don't fit the characters as presented previously in the last 17 years.The 2:21 run time seemed to drag past three hours as I felt a lack of empathy for any of the characters as they are not fully developed and flushed but rather used as props for beautiful shots against the desert and country roads of Mexico and rural America.Logan's disregard to the other characters in the film was forced and lacked any connection to the empathetic character we were introduced to in the original X-Men film in which we were introduced to a character that felt compelled to help Marie D'Ancanto after encountering her on the road. Logan, though he has tried to be a loner, never really was a loner without any empathy. That is until this movie and the motivation for this lack of empathy towards a little girl and her issues is troubling as a movie goer. I can not find a reason to recommend this movie or to see it again outside of the beautiful cinematography throughout the film."
"The film repeated the following scenes:1. Logan and the prof berating each other 2. Angry armed dudes in black cars appear 3. Logan cuts them downRinse and repeat. Just the surroundings changes, hideout scene, hotel scene, family scene...Soooo boring.The enemy was so dumb. They kept going close after seeing their buddies chopped down even though they had big guns that had range..."
"SpoilerI don't even know where to start. The amount of plot holes is just crazy. The fact that the all the people writing and directing this know nothing of Marvel's world is amazing. of all the excuses for a world without mutants they went with... I won't even tell you. In the end why did none of the kids help Logan? A whole crew of ""weapons"" not one did anything to help. Just weak, so very very weak. To whomever said this was Xmen's Dark Knight. Shame on you. Shame. Shame. Shame. If you are looking for a summary. Logan is an uber driver, he has to take his clone to North Dakota while avoiding his Clone and people who make clones. Corn Syrup is bad for you, and kills mutants. Oh and Hugh Jackman can finally move on with his life."
"Notice the positive reviews of this and every other XMen/Wolverine  movie. They all claim ""masterpiece"", ""the best superhero movie  eveeeeeeeeeeeer"", and ""this is how you make a superhero movie"".  The positive reviews are canned, scripted, generated by publicists.  This movie wants to be Terminator. It even uses similar music as the  perfect killing machine stalks a little girl protected by the imperfect  killing machine.  Like other Boreverine movies, this one takes away Wolverine's healing  because the writers don't know how to handle it. The Wolverine from the  comic books is weakened and supposedly humanized. But what's left is a  Wolverine bereft of what makes him super and bereft of all emotion.  Can we get a superhero movie that's about a hero?"
"Marvel's 'X-Men' universe has come a long way since its debut on the silver screen back in 2000. 17 years later, audiences get to experience 'Logan,' the final chapter in the franchise as we know it.In 'Logan,' we have a much darker, grittier story in which Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is faced with helping a young mutant (Dafne Keen) escape the anti-mutant strongholds of Mexico and the USA to Canada. In this sense, the film should not be considered a traditional superhero story, but instead a violent drama. There is much more of an emphasis on character development and dialogue as opposed to special effects and cheesy one-liners, as we see how the physical and emotional wear-and-tear that Logan has experienced over the years has finally taken its toll on him.In addition to Jackman and Keen, we get to see strong performances from Patrick Stewart reprising his role as the venerable Professor Charles Xavier and Boyd Holbrook as the bounty hunter Pierce. This core cast is enough of a foundation on which to build the rest of the film, and is a better way to create a more meaningful film compared with stretching screen time too thin in previous 'X-Men' offerings.There are also a few themes that are explored through 'Logan,' including perseverance, sacrifice and faith, which elevates the impact that the film has on audiences. Through all of these, it's really the metamorphosis that Logan undergoes as an individual based on the challenges he confronts that really puts an accent mark on the film.While it's bittersweet to see this franchise likely end, 'Logan' is a worthy, respectable finale that does enough to satisfy fans."
"I can't get that time back. Somehow Wolverine is now old and dying. And has the ambition to run away on a boat. Enter bad guys and new mutants, lots of violence and ..... I kept waiting for something to happen. But it didn't. I kept hoping that they wouldn't do the next expected thing, but they did. Don't waste your time on this one. You can't get the time back."
"The movie was quite depressing. Logan and Charles have aged, and are not doing well. They are hiding out and keeping Charles drugged so he won't hurt anyone.I just didn't like the violence for the sake of violence in the movie. Most of the super hero movies were rated PG-13, now we have another one that is rated R. There one flash of brief nudity, so we could have that added to the rating of the movie, that did nothing to add to the plot of the movie.The movie seemed to go out of its way to kill anything that brought a moment of pleasure to heroes of the story.They don't give Laura's age in the movie, but the actress is 11 years old. Having her kill people over and over and throwing a severed head to the leader of the villains is just going a bit overboard."
"on itself a just ""ok"" movie, could be so much better with some consistency & attention to details. In relation to the theme; horrifyingly bad! Characters do not match up with previous story lines/development etcetc.**spoilers** (So as a stand alone movie 5 stars, otherwise -5). Directer really missed out on the essentials. Why are there no more mutants? What traumatized xavier? From what is Wolverine dying exactly? killer kids running away for a few soldiers? etcetc"
"In 2029, mutants have been extinct and Logan (Hugh Jackman) works as a limousine chauffeur in Texas near the border with Mexico. Logan lives in an abandoned plant with the mutant Caliban (Stephen Merchant), who was a tracker, and they take care of the senile Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), who does not have control of his telepathic ability and needs to use drugs to stay calm. One day, Logan is attending a funeral and a woman called Gabriela (Elizabeth Rodriguez) call him Wolverine but he does not give attention to her. Soon the bounty hunter Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook) meets Logan and asks to help him to find an eleven year-old girl called Laura (Dafne Keen) that is with Gabriela. Logan is contacted again by Gabriela and she asks Logan to drive Laura and her to a place called Eden in North Dakota and she offers to pay for his service. The reluctant Logan accepts the job but Gabriela is murdered. He returns to the place where he lives and finds Laura there with Professor Xavier and Caliban. However Pierce returns with a group and Laura uses abilities similar to Logan to escape with Professor Xavier and Logan, but Caliban is captured by Pierce and his men. While heading to Eden. Logan discovers that Gabriela was a nurse in the Transigen Corporation taking care of children developed with abilities by Dr. Zander Rice (Richard E. Grant). When the Transigen decided to shut down the program and kill the children, Gabriela and the other nurses released them and now Laura intends to join her friends. Will they find the sanctuary?""Logan"" is the swan song of Wolverine and Professor Charles Xavier in a dismal, violent and sad film. The plot is totally different from the genre with a dark story and unpleasant hero. The road trip showing two former superheroes protecting a girl with abilities is not original, but the cruel fate of the family that welcomes them in their home is. In the end, ""Logan"" is a well-made film too somber for a comic book adaptation. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Logan"""
"Tonight will be the 3rd time I've tried to watch this film. Never got beyond 30 minutes. It's dull, predictable, there's nothing to like about the protagonist, he's boring and depressing. It's needlessly violent, the script puts you to sleep. Oh well, 3rd time lucky.."
"Complete garbage. If they make a x23 movie hopefully dakken will show up and kill her. That will be ten times better. Hell let anyone kill this joke of a character. Marvel is run by a bunch of idiots right now. Kill off wolverine and give us this crap as a replacement, I was cheering for the reavers to win.The old man Logan story killed this waste of time and money. Do yourself a favor and just read the real Logan/wolverine comics."
Quite possibly the worst Marvel Movie of all time. Yet another movie that baffles me with the high praises surrounding it.The story line is nothing but depressing. No part of the information that is being offered explains why Logan would end up in that living situation or where all the already existing mutants are while this is happening. The plot is full of logic holes and too much of it simply doesn't make any sense. I have no idea why this movie was made.
"I'm not going to waste a whole lot of time breaking down the movie Logan. There are over one thousand user reviews on IMDb and by now interest in this movie has waned, plenty of people have already critiqued it in detail and added to that, few people will stumble upon the page of reviews that mine ends up on. And as wordy as I am, I'm ironically just posting this review to save people time that could be better spent elsewhere. So here goes... my fast reviewSKIP TO HERE-Have you seen Children of Men? If you have, you've already seen this movie. Logan is Children of Men's future for mutants. If you haven't, watch Children of Men instead. It's not the best, but it's better than Logan (as always, Michael Caine > Patrick Stewart)-Do you know what Oscar Bait is? If you do, take my word for it. This is the best way to describe Logan (although the idea that anyone involved in Logan could be so delusional as to think that this movie would receive consideration would actually be legitimately depressing as opposed to the shallow feeling of dreariness it tries to create. If that was the goal all along then it is genius. Bravo! But honestly... nothing against the cast, but there are no Oscar worthy performances here. There is no best written screenplay here. And as for the biggest awards, did anyone really think this would be the Sci-Fi movie that pulled it off?)If you do not know what Oscar Bait is, google it and read the wiki definition or even better read the one from TV Tropes (http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OscarBait). Oscar Bait movies are the kind of movies that think being sad and depressing equals art. They try to appeal to the crowd that avoids films that are well liked in general. For them, a happy ending is cheesy, it's for the masses, it's less creative. Sad endings, they believe, are brave and smart and edgy and above all, more deserving of the word ""art."" In reality, this is of course complete garbage. A well written good ending takes just as much effort to create as a bad one.Logan attempted to go ""artsy"" and ""dark"" and it felt shallow and clichéd. For me, the whole story was a very lazy way to explain why Hugh Jackman looks too old now and why Logan the character is no longer regenerating. It isn't original or ground breaking; it ripped off a movie that isn't even old, as if everyone would have forgotten that Children of Men existed, which I'm sure if I did some reading, would turn out to be not entirely original itself. I'm not about to say that films with sad endings are always like this. Some of my favorite films of all time have sad endings. Cuckoo's Nest, Aviator, Midnight Cowboy (though a little uplifting too), sometimes artists have a story to tell and those stories don't always end well for everyone involved. (side note, does anyone else but me think that Coming to America has the happiest ending of all time? Even Daryl finds happiness in the end, everyone wins! anyways..) So don't think that I'm biased against films that do go dark, I just want for them to be done well and with honesty. So what if comic books are what we read as kids in order to escape how awful reality really is and how rarely the good guy wins. So what if super-heroes exist because of how appealing the fantasies they create are and satisfying it is to envision a world where justice always prevails and nothing bad ever happens to good and innocent people. If you want to go dark and depressing do it! Just don't be lazy about it, put a little effort into it. Be sad if you want to just have an engaging and original story to tell. Maybe they should have done to Wolverine what the franchise did to Cyclops. If you can't come up with something clever just kill him off-screen instead. I'm trying to figure out which death is more disrespectful to the source material and fans of the character. I'm also trying to figure out why the X-Men get so many chances after failing more times than not, while my Punisher gets screwed up one time and then gets banished to the small screen. ...Well I guess my review ended up a little longer than I originally intended. Sorry I'm so wordy, I just don't get out much and when I do I'm usually pretty quiet so when I get the chance to speak or communicate I end up abusing it and I never know when to..... .. I'll attempt to make up for it, I'll make that fast (rant free) review now.... here goes....SKIP TO HERE INSTEADLogan is Oscar Bait. It is lazy unoriginal garbage that takes itself way too seriously."
"Once they were the strongest on earth. They could even change the course of history ... But something terrible happened and now they are no more.Logan - one of those units who are still alive, has already aged and drags on a miserable existence, working for pennies and watching how quickly his country and people around him are degrading. He no longer wants to participate in any conflicts, but simply wants to live in peace. But they do not give it to him. And even despite constant provocations, he does not want to harm anyone to anybody and attacks only when he is already being pressed. However, as you know, there is nothing more terrible than a beast driven into a corner. And then the offenders will regret that they dared to raise their hand against him and those close to him.This is a very deep and humane film about an outcast, no one needs a single person, for whom his whole very long life was a constant struggle. Life is full of wars, pain, suffering ... disappointment. He never knew what peace was. I did not know what it's like when you are really loved, when someone very much wants to be alive and close.Someone like him. The same tortured outcast is a loner."
"I missed this film when it was in theaters. That is probably for the best, not that I had any desire to see it then due to the fact my fiancé had just recently passed away. If I had seen it, it probably would have triggered an attack. It still did, but at least I was in my own home so no one could see me break down. Just anything like this makes me remember the love of my life and the tears just pour out and I end up having an attack and have trouble breathing. That being said, this was a very good movie and a nice way to send off Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. Sure, there are things that make me question what has happened to reduce everyone to the state they are in, but when one reads comics, one understands that the story being presented may be sort of an alternate universe story arc, rather than the main one. I say this is the case with this movie, things may not necessarily turn out the way they did in this film, just in this universe things seemed to have gone very badly. It is a way to change up the actor playing Wolverine and get some closure for the X-men films starring him and Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier.The story has Logan as a limo driver trying to earn enough cash to get a boat so that he and Professor Xavier can escape to the sea. Xavier is having trouble controlling his powers in his old age and Logan watches over him as there are hints that the professor has done something rather bad due to this lack of control. Logan is being assisted by a mutant named Caliban who has the ability to detect other mutants, a power nearly worthless now as mutants have become few and far between. Well, a woman tries to get Logan to help her as she has a young girl with her and some men are tracking both of them. This girl is apparently a mutant with some very familiar powers. Logan escapes with her and Professor Xavier and they must stay one step ahead of the agents determined to capture her. However, there is another familiar face that is unleashed in the agents efforts to recapture the young girl and several other mutant children trying to flee their grasp.I enjoyed the film for the most part, the only problem I had is that I was hoping for someone cooler when they revealed the soulless mutant who had no problem killing. They really did not have anyone new as far as mutants on display as Caliban was the only one I do not think was seen before. I would have liked the reveal to show the new weapon to be Omega Red. Granted, that would have meant a few more special effects I guess so we do not really get anyone new at all on display.So the film was good and the action was plentiful and quite gruesome. I knew there would be a bit more stuff shown because this film was rated R, but I was surprised at how many heads rolled and appendages flying everywhere. From what a few people had said about the film that I know, there really was not much action in the film. Not sure what film they were watching as there was a good deal. So ends Hugh Jackman's Wolverine and he did a good job in the role. I just find the makers starting with Marc Singer really did not do the character true justice as he was a much better fighter than the films portrayed, and his healing ability was not as effective in the comics as depicted in the films either. Basically, he was more apt to dodge in the comics than go head on and he would never have any problems fighting ordinary men and most superheroes could not match his fighting skills. Still, as I said, I just think of it as an alternative universe and it still saddens me to see Jackman depart the role."
"Who wrote this stuff? it's god awful. The blood and gore don't bother me,but the stupid predictable,idiotic decisions do. No person would ever take those decisions. I have not read these comic that this ""new"" old wussifed Logan/wolverine is based on,but based on this movie,I haven't really missed out on anything.If you take out the mutant element of this movie,it's your average generic slow burner drama ,with a hint of action.Long dragged out dialogue,with no real purpose. Half spoken sentences.And of course the anti hero, who makes all the wrong decisions that makes a B movie. 4-5 times Logan could have easily killed the main antagonist, and just ended the whole pursuit and killing of innocent.But every time he runs away instead,just so you can have the final show down.And even than he fights like a girl I was actually hoping someone would just put him out of his misery"
I was pleasantly Surprised on this movie. What held it for me is that you didn't need all the other marvel comic characters in the film. Story Arc was well produced and adapted to the big screen. As another reviewer mentioned I also wished there would have been more fight sequences between Logan and X-23. I thoroughly enjoyed this film.
"Yup, and everyone dies. The end. Oh, I have to write more. These movies are getting worse and worse. If someone is writing a good review for this movie they are feeding of the hype. Even the story is boring and the it's so desperate they cloned wolverine. I really don't know what it is with Hollywood and bringing little kids in the movie that are annoying. Characters were so bad I didn't even care they died. I felt nothing during this entire movie it was so bad. More boring? Wait, while you're at it why not bring in monkeys?"
"I was not a big fan of dark knight but I will take that movie any day over this garbage. For god's sake this is a superhero movie---and depth is not achieved by showing devolution of wolverine into a straw man!!! This is a muddled-plodding movie where sacrifices are made by superheroes in such an insignificant way that it makes even the previous wolverine movies irrelevant. Hugh Jackman is a charismatic and talented actor and he was born to play the role of wolverine---but sadly here he is a shell of himself and you cannot wait for movie to end......movie never picks up pace, even though this is supposed to be a road movie....an anticlimactic, unsatisfying ending with confused half-hearted political undertones. Watch at your own risk."
"This movie was pointless, hopeless and completely miserable from beginning to the end. All of the X men are dead, mutants are extinct and we watch the final sad moments of our favorite characters lives, Charles and Logan, before we watch them die. Thank you for killing this world completely, my favorite fantasy and they choked it! I seriously feel like a part of me has died. I wish they had stopped after last one and let us keep our fantasy."
"If you've ever wanted to watch a little girl roll a severed human head over a dusty parking lot, go see ""Logan."" ""Logan"" is a violent, gory, hateful, ugly, senseless and charmless movie. Hugh Jackman stars as Wolverine, aka Logan, a man with retractable claws in his hands. He connects with Laura, a mutant like himself. The girl is trying to escape from mistreatment in Mexico to a safe house in Canada called ""Eden."" She is being pursued by a bad guy, a white man with – you guessed it – a Southern accent. And I bet you already know the bad guy's name – it's Donald. Donald chasing a Mexican girl who must escape to safety in Canada – I know what you are thinking. This is an artistically and intellectually ambitious film that will deliver more than clichés. Abandon all such hope anyone who buys a ticket for this splatter mess. In fact why not just stay home and watch terrorist videos on YouTube? Hugh Jackman may as well not even have appeared in this bloated, exploitative, anti-human mess. The film is just one long hyperviolent chase scene. Donald catches up with Logan and Laura, and there is a lengthy fight involving decapitations, dismemberment, and graphic impalement of various body parts. You see Logan's blades puncturing faces and skulls. When the director feels that the fight scene has gone on long enough, Logan and Laura make a temporary escape. Donald regroups, lather, rinse, repeat. There are a couple of gratuitous Christophobic images. One of the bad guys has a Christian cross tattooed on his arm. The arm is removed from his body. In another scene, a cross is repurposed into an X, for X- Men."
"This has been the worst Marvel that anyone could have ever thought about making. To top it off, it had to be over 2 hours.. so your sitting thinking its going to get better! Its got to get better right? Come on.. Its Marvel, it cant be that bad. But no.. till the last minute, completely awful slow scenes that has no relations to any Marvel theme or story. If I could sue the producers for wasting my time and destroying the Marvel image, I completely would!!@"
"I am absolutely stunned that this film has received so much positive feedback online; when I couldn't be more disappointed! It's by far the worst Marvel film we have seen to date. The story line was incredibly weak – I personal believe it was written by a 12-year-old child – and the movie itself, is set during another random messed up future time line, which completely falls out of sync with the rest of the X-Men (or Marvel) films we have seen to-date. Once again, this movie failed to capture (or portray) Wolverine's character properly. The closest we've seen so far is: The Wolverine (2013). However, my biggest criticism is: I am so sick to death of seeing Wolverine fight at a disadvantage. It's like he has a permanent piece of Kryptonite rammed so far up his ass, he is incapable of fighting properly. In the first Wolverine film (X-Men Origins: Wolverine), we were forced to watch him fight with the indignity of bone claws; I wasn't very happy when Marvel added bone claws to Wolverine's mutation in 1994, when in the previous 20 years, his claws were always the result of the Weapon X project. Not some bizarre, gross mutation. However, since it was an Origin story, I can bring myself to overlook this. In the second film (The Wolverine), his powers were suppressed by Viper (or that machine attached to his heart), and in this film (Logan), we were forced to watch him: as a tired, broken down, old man. It's so disappointing You might notice, when we watch all the other Marvel superheros on screen, they're all fighting at full strength (or in their prime); not at 10 or 20 percent of their working capacity. I want to see Wolverine completely cut lose! Is that too much to ask!! In the Avengers (or in the Captain America films), we see Captain America seriously kick ass, he is awesome, and so are all the Avengers. Even Spiderman and Ant-man kicked ass in the last Avengers film. We have never seen Wolverine shown in that light before. Half the time Wolverine is getting his ass kicked by random no bodies, and there is never a mission impossible factor involved. I cannot believe Disney don't get that God, it's pathetic!! I think we could have seen Wolverine fight at his best if he joined the Avengers, and I would have loved to seen Hugh Jackman join the team. He probably would have stolen the spotlight though.I am also getting a bit sick and tired of seeing Marvel (or Disney now) releasing a X-Men film with no concept of who the X-Men are, what the series is all about, and what the characters are all capable of. In the first X-Men movie for example, Mystique and Rogue are mortal enemies, when in the comic book series, Mystique is actually Rogues adopted mother, so they would never harm one another, and their relationship is critical to the Rogues eventual story. In X2 and X-Men 3, Jean was given the power of the Phoenix Force, when the Phoenix's abilities were never part of her natural mutation. In X-Men 3, Professor X and Juggernaut weren't even step brothers, and in the final X-Men film: Apocalypse, Mystique and Nightcrawler were roughly the same age, when Mystique is Nightcrawlers biological mother, and there are errors or inconsistencies like this throughout the entire X-Men (film) series. With this film for example, Laura has the exact same mutation (or powers) as Wolverine; that isn't how mutations work, identical powers aren't passed from father to son. I can provide 1000 examples on this point but I won't. God!! Does anyone actually read the comic books over there at Disney?! Just imagine tuning into a random episode of Game of Thrones and none of the Lannisters are related, the Tyrion Lannister (the Imp) is a Giant (and is as dump as a box of hair) and Winterfell is in the South rather than the North, which is completely being run by the White Walkers under the blistering sun. You would think: if Hollywood was going to make a movie based on Games of Thrones, they could at least get these facts right – or is that asking too much? Apparently so I feel that's what the X-Men (film) series has become now. I feel it's become nothing more than a jumbled mess of random crap, and we're supposed to praise Marvel (or Disney) for their work. This movie was nothing more than another messed up alternate future, where mutates have largely been wiped out. So in the next X-Men film, are we going to see another time traveler go back in time and fixes thing because Marvel (or Disney) are incapable of producing a decent X-Men film. That's going to get, real old real fast. Whoever wrote this film has no concept of who Wolverine is or what the X-Men is all about! They came close in X- Men: First Class, X- Men: Days of Future Past and The Wolverine. I know these movies have inconsistencies compared to the comics but at least they came close to capturing what the X-Men is all about. However, this movie (Logan) was a complete mess, and only encourages me NOT to see anymore X-Men films at the movies! And, I won't be ever again! The X-Men has so much potential on the big screen but Disney seems determine to screw it all up! You know, get your sh*t together people, we deserve much better"
The movie is crap! I don't know in animations to Marvel Wolverine is dying. Even the qualities of character don't meet the original. Why not learn how to make spectacular films like reading comic books and don't stop to invent nonsense. The last two films were terrible. I hope your next project to be much better.
