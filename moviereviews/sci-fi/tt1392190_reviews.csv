"When I wrote this review 3 years ago I had no idea how many people hate this movie and they are preferring Mad Max 3 over this film. Claming Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome the third film is better film than this, really? Better than this? Listen folks it has no Mel Gibson so what? So what's your point? Gibson dropped out this film and he wasn't interested, it was in development for years, since in 2004 this movie was announced. George Miller did something different with this film and he got hate for it. I hate Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome to death! It is rated PG-13 family film and I wanted an action bloody rated R film not a boring stupid lame fu**** movie! I got an rated R bloody action film that I wanted in Mad Max: Fury Road. I was entertained and I enjoy it. At least it wasn't so sick like was Beyond Thunderdome. Mad Max: Fury Road is my second favorite film in the franchise and this movie did it right and it correct that third film that it failed been an good action film. Like it or hate it, is your problem but in my opinion it is a good action violent movie and I love it to death I am an action junkie myself. Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is my number 1 favorite film of all time. I think Mad Max: Fury Road is George Miller's masterpiece. Finally, Finally after 30.years of fiasco Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome that completely destroyed the Mad Max Trilogy, George Miller finally come back and fix the mistake he did 30.years ago. Why wouldn't I love this film? This film is the best one in the series along side Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior at least for me it is the best film. It has action, high explosive and Tom Hardy been a real Mad Max unlike Mel Gibson was in Thunderdome. I am happy they made the 4th movie. Tom Hardy was a bad ass Mad Max. I didn't even noticed that we don't have Mel Gibson in here. Tom Hardy breaths life into Max Rockatansky and Charlize Theron is excellent and emotionally perfect as Furiosa. I love high speed and pursuit on a road which I seriously love this. The thing was more similar to Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior but much better, George Miller fix it, the film did not copy The Road Warrior the film has it is own story. All, the stunts and action sequences are SPECTACULAR. Immortan Joe was a fantastic villain in here he was really good. The film shows a real wasteland and the future which I am really happy about it. NOTE: ""Don't waste your time if you have seen the original."" from a hater review my reply: Yes I will waste my time watching this awesome action flick! Yes I have seen the Original Film Mad Max with Mel Gibson so many times than you ever did! I love this film much more than Mad Max because sometimes the original is very boring and the film has so much Drama in it and less Action than it is in Fury Road. I wanted to have an apocalyptic action film like are Fury Road and The Road Warrior which this film fix it. Finally yes Finally I have seen a good Action Film from 2015 and It is finally the finest blockbuster of 2015! Mad Max: Fury Road is a 2015 post-apocalyptic action film directed and produced by George Miller, and written by Miller, Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris. The fourth installment in the Mad Max franchise, it is an Australian and American venture produced by Kennedy Miller Mitchell, RatPac-Dune Entertainment and Village Roadshow Pictures. The film is set in a future desert wasteland where gasoline and water are scarce commodities.10/10 Awesome film I have seen it twice. I love this film to death I love it! Fury Road would be the second favorite best film in the franchise."
"George Miller returns to live-action filmmaking with one of the greatest action films ever put to screen. 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is ridiculous in all the right ways.For those who have seen the original films and loved them, you'll fall in love all over again with this film. Tom Hardy takes the reigns this time around as Max - a man of few words who has been hardened by the world in which he lives. Along with him is Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa - a woman who seeks redemption by helping five young '""wives"" escape from the film's antagonist.Leading up to the film's release, many speculated if this would be just another action film that lacks a solid narrative and motive, but I am happy to say that this is simply not the case. Yes, the film does fill 80% of its run-time with action sequences, but it never gets in the way of the humanity between these characters that Miller has brought to life. There are some emotional moments. Specifically, with Theron's character. Is the story something we haven't seen before? Not at all. But in a film loaded with action, it's nice to see a solid narrative.Now, how about those action sequences? Incredible - exhilarating - jaw-dropping. George Miller has put together some of the greatest, most memorable action set-pieces ever. One thing that sets the action in this film apart from a good majority of mediocre action films today is that every action the character's make have an affect on them. For good and for bad. The action is not pointless. It's motivated. And it's glorious to behold thanks to the use of practical effects, incredible stunt work and stunning cinematography.'Mad Max: Fury Road' has set a new standard for action films. It's arguably the greatest action film of the 21st century. It's that good. George Miller has brought back what we loved about 80's action films while also brining new ideas to the table. It's the best time I've had in a theater in a long time, and I couldn't help but laugh in appreciation of the ridiculousness that was unfolding before my eyes. The film left me feeling giddy, with a big smile on my face."
"An action essential through and through, it's plain and simple! Since the days of 'Die Hard' and 'Terminator', the action genre has turned into a repetitive, over-the-top array of films trying too hard to create entertaining sequences that instead look too cheesy due to bad composition or an overuse of CGI, of course along the way we have had some fine exceptions in the style of 'Casino Royale' and 'The Dark Knight', but certain directors *cough* Michael Bay... don't seem to be able to use their knowledge of an action sequence to its full potential and instead have constant fiery explosions and over-the-top shaky camera-work among other things... oh but then there's 'Mad Max: Fury Road', talk about epic action pieces. It has been 30 years since the release of 'Beyond Thunderdome' back in 1985, and George Miller decided to return to the directorial chair for a Mad Max reboot, and my God, he truly is a mastermind of action. After creating the epic scale of an action film in the form of 'Mad Max: The Road Warrior' it was going to be hard to live up to the previous films in the franchise, but Miller didn't just do that, he excelled at it and instead beat his previous films. With Tom Hardy as the new face of Max and Namibia as the new backdrop for post- apocalyptic Australia, 'Fury Road' is an exhilarating action fest that goes beyond its boundaries in creating what might just be one of the greatest action films ever made. Hearing that nearly 90% of the stunts and effects were practical literally blew me away, the sequences are extravagant and complex with frequent fireballs and car crashes filling the screen. George Miller's 2015 vigorous tale blends emotion and brutality with drama and action to reignite Australia's greatest film franchise and create the epitome of the action genre."
"Mad Max: Fury Road, starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, is George Miller's attempt to reignite his long dormant Mad Max franchise...and my god does he ever. For the past decade or so, with exceptions such as John Wick, The Bourne Trilogy, and The Raid, action movies seem to be struggling to capture the excitement and enjoyment the genre once held; a tenacity that classics from the 80's and 90's had in spades. George Miller single handedly delivers our saving grace with Fury Road on the back of a spike covered oil rig with a blind zombie playing a fire breathing electric guitar.Max is a man of few words, but Tom Hardy's talent for portraying strong, silent characters shines through in a gruff but sympathetic performance. He teams up with Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa to save the last 5 hot women in the world from the leader of a powerful cult with a terrifying breathing mask inspired by the Cheshire Cat from Alice in Wonderland. From there, the chase is on. Using this simple plot as the setting, we are able to bear witness to one of the most beautifully shot films in years. The world of Mad Max looks absolutely gorgeous, combining awe-inspiring practical effects and landscapes with bold colours brimming from all edges of the frame. These are of course just bonuses in enhancing the primary reason people will love this film, the action itself. I'm happy to report these action sequences are damn near flawless. No shaky cam, barely a hint of CGI, and scenes where we actually feel like our characters are in danger (yes Furious 7 I'm calling you out). Total chaos relentlessly ensues for the majority of the film, but it's chaos you can follow clearly and marvel at. Whether it's one of the explosive car sequences, or one of the smaller emotional moments, Mad Max: Fury Road refuses to let up on tension for one second.There's a reason this movie is sitting at 98% on Rotten Tomatoes. This is an action movie that will set a precedent for years to come, roaring ferociously at all who may challenge it. Hopefully, this is only the beginning of a genre revolution early in the making.FINAL VERDICT: Mad Max: Fury Road is a beautifully chaotic display of masterfully executed action sequences with a strong emotional core, and a raw energy unmatched by nearly all of its action genre competition."
"This movie is an amazing addition of the Mad Max stories, it is definitely a great chase movie, it has all the action and enjoyment to keep the viewer entertained, with the acting and visuals to show the real madness of the wasteland that the movie is set in."
"I'm not completely sure what I was expecting from Fury Road, but it was more than this. This is the latest example of Hollywood rehashing a successful and good movie franchise solely for profit. It's mindless, repetitive action sequences melded between horrible acting and overused clichés.One of the allures of this series is seeing the outlandish road vehicles that are used, and in this the movie mostly delivers. You have the high-powered Warrior Rig driven by Furiosa. There's battle vehicles equipped with spikes, rigs with counter-balanced poles for launching warriors into other vehicles, and there's even a vehicle equipped with large bass drums and a stack of speakers that would make KISS jealous with a psychotic guitarist wailing away for our musical enjoyment. And of course, each vehicle comes equipped with more explosive arsenal than a battle ship. And it's put to good use.However, once you get past the eye candy, you realize there's nothing else to it. The story is weak. The characters are weaker. And the acting is the worst. The movie never drew me in. Not even close. Whenever the movie 'tried' to add depth and be dramatic, it was painful and embarrassing to watch. The scene where Furiosa reacts to finding out her birth home is gone by taking off her prosthetic arm and dropping down to her knees may be the worst movie scene I've ever watched. And it says something when the most interesting character is Nux, a relentless slave/warrior who actually has a mind of his own and decides to help Max and Furiosa in their quest. Of course, one of Immortan Joe's wives falls for him, representing one of the many poorly executed clichés this movie is riddled with.I can watch a superficial action movie and enjoy it for what it is, to a point. This one, however, is just generally so poorly executed that it leaves a lot to be desired. I didn't hate it, but I have absolutely no desire to see it again."
"It's hard to believe that the same talented director who made the influential cult action classic The Road Warrior had anything to do with this disaster.Road Warrior was raw, gritty, violent and uncompromising, and this movie is the exact opposite. It's like Road Warrior for kids who need constant action in their movies.This is the movie. The good guys get into a fight with the bad guys, outrun them, they break down in their vehicle and fix it. Rinse and repeat. The second half of the movie is the first half again just done faster.The Road Warrior may have been a simple premise but it made you feel something, even with it's opening narration before any action was even shown. And the supporting characters were given just enough time for each of them to be likable or relatable.In this movie there is absolutely nothing and no one to care about. We're supposed to care about the characters because... well we should. George Miller just wants us to, and in one of the most cringe worthy moments Charlize Theron's character breaks down while dramatic music plays to try desperately to make us care.Tom Hardy is pathetic as Max. One of the dullest leading men I've seen in a long time. There's not one single moment throughout the entire movie where he comes anywhere near reaching the same level of charisma Mel Gibson did in the role. Gibson made more of an impression just eating a tin of dog food. I'm still confused as to what accent Hardy was even trying to do.I was amazed that Max has now become a cartoon character as well. Gibson's Max was a semi-realistic tough guy who hurt, bled, and nearly died several times. Now he survives car crashes and tornadoes with ease? In the previous movies, fuel and guns and bullets were rare. Not anymore. It doesn't even seem Post-Apocalyptic. There's no sense of desperation anymore and everything is too glossy looking. And the main villain's super model looking wives with their perfect skin are about as convincing as apocalyptic survivors as Hardy's Australian accent is. They're so boring and one-dimensional, George Miller could have combined them all into one character and you wouldn't miss anyone.Some of the green screen is very obvious and fake looking, and the CGI sandstorm is laughably bad. It wouldn't look out of place in a Pixar movie. In the previous movies, there was occasionally a sped up frame rate that gave a nice homage to the silent era. Now,Miller has gone full Looney Toons and sped up the majority of the action, making many of the real stunts redundant. They're too fast to fully enjoy. There's no tension, no real struggle, or any real dirt and grit that Road Warrior had. Everything George Miller got right with that masterpiece he gets completely wrong here."
"Yo punishable by death just letting you know that this movie was shot using 80% practical effects and that's a fact on this web page so you're completely wrong when you say that it's full of cgi. But anyway this movie is a real crazy ride. From the very beginning it takes you straight into the action and never lets go. This movie is so incredibly filmed and the stunts are performed marvelously. Although this movie is said to star Tom hardy and Charlize Theron, the real star here is George miller. This man created a masterpiece and it was so beautifully put together. He managed to show the chaos and urgency without the constant shaky camera crap that we see out of action movies now. This is the best pure action movie that I've ever seen."
"First off, this is another movie in which the action sequences last so long that you can go to the bathroom, get a soda, come back and still find the same people fighting the same fights you saw begin 15 minutes earlier. Personally, these type of action movies bore me to tears, because the story has to stop moving every time we watch one of these extended action sequences. In terms of story, the good guys and the bad guys meeting is a plot point. Then they fight, then one of them wins. As an audience member, I'm ready to know who wins as soon as they start fighting. And I really need the lead characters to have some logical reasons for doing what they are doing. Here's my spoiler: They drive away from someplace for half the movie and then decide to turn around and go back. The only thing that happened was that they picked up a gang of old ladies. That's as deep as it gets right there. They're running away, fighting the whole way, they get away and then they decide to go back, so they have to fight the whole way. Nothing makes much sense, no characters are anything but as shallow as they could have possibly been made. If you like Avatar, you'll like this movie. If you liked Mad Max and Road Warrior, you're going to be angry about how that franchise was exploited in name and setting only. This character isn't Mad Max. He doesn't have a dog, he doesn't eat dog food, he doesn't eat anything. Nobody in the film ever eats anything. Nor are people clamoring for gasoline, they all just seem to have it. There's an issue with water, but it makes no sense and the entire weak plot seems to depend on it. The movie ends with giant water valves being opened just like the air valves on Mars get turned on in the end of that Governor Arnold movie, I can't remember the name. The reviews calling this something new and different are absolute hogwash. This is nothing but things blowing up and cars crashing for two hours, which, by the way, is another egregious offense of these silly movies. They take a 90 minute movie with a great story line, and they strip it of plot and somehow extend it by 30 minutes. It's a scary trend, the kind of thing that makes one think Idiocracy was prophetic. The less the story and the more things blow up, the higher the ratings. Ridiculous!"
"Mad Max Fury Road is George Miller's return to the franchise he started way back in 1979 with Mad Max. I will start by saying this movie was absolutely batsh** insane. It was filled right to the brim with continuous over the top bloody ridiculous action sequences that keep you on the edge of the seat and just amazed at what Is happening on screen. Now this film doesn't have much of a plot at all but seriously you're not going into this film for an intense plot, this is a film that almost didn't even need one at all. The one thing I was worried about going in was whether I needed to have seen the previous films to understand this one and thankfully you don't, the story is independent of the previous film which was really helpful. The characters were all awesome and it did an amazing job to introduce them all almost instantly and get right into the action. Max (Tom Hardy? and Furiosa (Charlize Theron) were were great and extremely likable characters. Even the villain who I will just call Sweet Tooth was so great, he wasn't anything too special but was a great threat throughout the film. I just absolutely loved this movie, intense action from start to finish and didn't slow down at all, that made it ridiculously fun to watch. The great characters and the performances are awesome on screen and we're always interesting to watch. If there was ever a Twisted Metal movie, this is what it would be. Nothing really let the film down and everything really worked, such a great time and the best cinema experience this year so far. - 10"
"It's troubling that a movie can be singularly focused on loud explosions and violence with no plot, dialogue, or character development, yet receive widespread critical acclaim. This is the first film I've ever seen that actually reminded me of the type the populace in Idiocracy would find enthralling. To be clear, there are no redeeming qualities about this film. None. And I went in with pretty low expectations, figuring this would be some fun, mindless entertainment i.e The Expendables or any Jason Statham movie. The first few minutes weren't too bad: it looked cheesy, but it had potential. But then I realized that this movie is one long (boring) car chase...and that's it. Really. I mean it really was boring -- exactly what an action movie should not be. The car chases are all one and the same. After a few minutes, it just isn't exciting.There is no story. The two leads drive to the middle of nowhere, then turn around. That's it. Two of the characters mention they are ""looking for redemption"" or some other trite nonsense, but the audience is never told why. Not that they'd care. Is the story about survival? At first you'd think so. Max mentions in the opening credits that he is a man reduced to one trait: survival. Yet at the film's end, when he finally has an opportunity to survive....he chooses not to? What? The movie was bad enough until this. Actually I forgot, there is an incredibly forced romance between two side characters that does nothing to further the story. This is a B movie with a big budget.Likewise, there is essentially no dialogue, save a few grunts from Max and cringe-inducingly awkward lines from the rest. There isn't any character development, but then again, the characters themselves resemble video game characters. There are no characters to develop, just two-dimensional avatars used for an excuse to show explosions. So what is this film's targeted demographic? I'm not sure. I can imagine that if you are a 13-year old boy, really into cars/trucks/slipknot, pretty redneck, and probably a little slow, this movie may seem pretty cool. I mean it does have ridiculous cars/trucks outfitted with lots of weapons, spikes, flame-exhausts, (breast-milk?) and guys playing ""cool"" guitar riffs for no apparent reason. There's also lots of explosions and fighting. And scantily clad women. And tornadoes. And skulls. On top of all that, there is no need to pay attention to petty plot lines or dialogue in order to enjoy the film. Hell once they reach the desert, the movie repeats itself as the leads drive the truck back through the same place being chased by the same guys for no discernible reason. The special effects aren't even that good. The whole movie looks fake. I know they went to great measures to avoid using CGI, but honestly, I thought I'd at least be impressed by the special effects, since clearly nothing was spent on anything else. And I'm not the kind of person who usually notices when CGI is used or not. Truly awful. I would rate it lower if I could. The only recent movie that may have actually been worse that this was Lucy, which was also mind-numbingly stupid. As the principal in Billy Madison once said, ""everyone in this room is now dumber for having (watched) it."" AVOID"
"George Miller returns with a bang and takes the helm of this crazy 2hr bonkers extravaganza named Mad Max: Fury Road. First of all, the stunts and action sequences are SPECTACULAR. Tom Hardy breaths life into Max Rockatansky and Charlize Theron is excellent and emotionally perfect as Furiosa. The story opens, with Immortan Joe who has young ladies as his wives, but he'll goes down when they escape the sadist's hands. Max, who has a violent past with Joe's cronies, decides to help Imperior Furiosa take the girls somewhere safe. Furiosa can't trust Max, and neither can he. So it all comes down to Joe's cronies fighting against them reaching to their destination. The movie is a bananas car chase for the runtime, as Max and Furiosa work together to fight against the evils. And then, there is Nux, a bonkers ""really skin coloured"" guy, who works with Joe, played well by Nicholas Hoult. The 3D really pays off, and is worth the extra ticket. The movie puts all other action movies of shame, the effects really pop out. Well, this is a definite masterpiece. One of the best movies of the year, one of the best action movies ever made and the role of Theron's life. Miller is truly a mastermind as stated clearly in the trailer. This exceeded my expectations, and will exceed yours as well. The dark style, dark comedy and the over the top characters make a return in this reboot. Must watch, and worth the extra IMAX 3D ticket."
"I can't believe why people like this movie unless you're a fan of no-brainer action-packed movies without a story. 2 hours of non stop rubbish without dialogue. I was a fan of the original Mad Max and at first Tom Hardy seemed like a great actor for the role, but this movie didn't do him justice. He did well as Bane but he wasn't the star in this movie, almost like a support character. I almost fell asleep and left the theater because I can find better ways to waste my time. The only positive thing I can say is that the world looks great as well as the props. Good job on that George Miller. At least there's something good about it. The trailer was promising and since many people praised this movie, I gave it a shot. How can you watch this for a second time ""to indulge in the deep content and story it provides"". There was absolutely nothing in there. Yes beautiful woman, owned by a dictator who holds all the water and controls the people. Let's escape, make a diversion, trap him, beat the living hell out of him and return to be happily accepted as the new rulers. Hurray."
"if you wanna go and see this movie, please expect nothing but frustrating, dazing, predictable outcome action, and then just when you think the movie is ending you get an extra 30-45 minutes of the same action same explosions, same cars and faces doing the same thing they did during the whole first half of the movie. Do not expect any engaging drama or any plot of any kind, but here's the story: post apocalypse, no water (yet there are hundreds of people alive and working), no fuel (yet they all have it in their vehicles), women escaping – women returning back the same day. What a plot! Visually it was stunning, but that's all you get."
"Mad Max: Fury Road sees veteran maestro director George Miller return to the Mad Max franchise after a 30 year hiatus.Fury Road is a hallmark in action films. Miller's post-apocalyptic future provides an impeccable backdrop for the crescendo of mayhem present in this movie. From the first scene to the last, there is plenty of spectacular action, vehicular and human. The cinematography is lush throughout. From the opening shot of the lizard being stomped by Max (Tom Hardy) to all the action scenes raging in the desert, the camera-work remains consistently on point. Many iconic shots are to be found in this movie.75% of the movie consists of action; so much that there isn't an 'action SCENE' present. Any action aficionados will have their expectations transcended while common moviegoers will have their satisfaction met too. What is surprising, however, is the emotional heft of the 25% that remains. Much of it is dedicated to the back story of Furiousa (Charlize Theron) who effortlessly delivers an Oscar worthy performance by mixing brawn with emotion for her internally wounded character.Nicholas Hoult's Nux, who provides one of the best lines of the film: ""It's a lovely day!"" at the midst of a crazy thunderstorm consisting tornadoes consisting cars consisting mad humans. Nux is an interesting character in this interesting world and provides plenty of the action by his well... actions.Finally, Tom Hardy's delivers a subtle performance as Mad Max. For a character whose name is slapped largely in the film poster, he receives barely a page of dialogue minus a monologue at the start. Considering the fact that he wears a Bane-like (see the parallel) mask throughout much of the film, it is surprising how powerful his performance actually is.One musical masterpiece act in the movie comes in the form of the guy the mask furiously shredding a flame-throwing electric guitar while dangling above a mobile wall of speakers that roars through the desert. Imagine that. When all hell breaks loose only accompanied by that as the background music, epic is truly an understatement as a description.Overall, Mad Max is a gleefully insane symphony of destruction that makes the Avengers seem like misfits and the Fast and Furious crew seem like the Slow and Sweet crew. This action packed masterpiece exhibits no shortage of high voltage, 2,000 horsepower action that also contains of lush cinematography, sufficient character development and a satisfactory plot (that works, cause it's 75% action anyways). Mad Max: Fury Road is definitely one of, if not the finest blockbuster of 2015!"
"I was left speechless when this finished. It can be hard to describe  indeed.... but I'll go for it...  Sheer madness that isn't sullied by bad acting or laughable lines. A  blockbuster that is gritty and doesn't have a sense of humour that  could be equated to a fluffy kitten. No 'lets all hug' sentimental BS.  This is seriously a movie I thought I'd never see: a CGI-filled  blockbuster that I flat out loved. The stunts are so much fun, the FX  so great, it is the first movie I have seen where I have thoroughly  enjoyed all this type of stuff - probably because the cinematography  for once doesn't suffer cos of it. It is all incredibly shot.  The action is so brutal and appropriately high-octane. I thought to  myself more than once, 'I think I am loving this more than Terminator  2' but other than that, there wasn't time to think. It kicked off fast  and barely stopped, and the lulls were amplified by the insanity  preceding them. Plus it is a dark film, which made it even better. I  many people do an Aussie accent even close to well, was Hardy actually  trying for that? Either way, he didn't talk much so it didn't really  matter. This is more Theron's movie than Hardy's, he doesn't say much  and does next to nothing for the first third or so. Theron's Furiosa is  more of the hero is the story, if there were to be a hero in such a  grisly and dark world.  I don't even like this type of movie but the execution is  everything. I'm gonna go see this again, soon. 4.5/5"
"Even at the beginning, there's no hint MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is going to a stop. Right at the very start, the engines are already rewing, gathering furious fires of vengeance and redemption, and before the audience could snap out of the sheer moments of brutal grittiness and exhilarating high-octane drama, they are surely already held hostage within the confines of a post-apocalyptic world, where everything is horrendously scarce. Not that it's a bad thing, no it's not. I tell you, this is like being hurled into the space in a roller-coaster ride. It's dangerous, but it's also thrilling. Witnessing this dystopic world and all its hellish drama unfold might make you grope for seatbelt under your seat.The film shares Max Rockatansky's (Tom Hardy) adventures. Max is an ex highway patrolman. He's been haunted by the past, by family he never saved. He meets the Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) who is being pursued by the dictatorial Wasteland leader ""Joe"". Furiosa reaches for Max for help in keeping the 'Five Wives'—women she brought with her—into safety, as Joe's deranged breed of warriors called The War Boys, that are barely humans, are raging across the desert to capture them. This pursuit throws the unlikely partners into the whalloping dangers of bloody escape, suddenly sending them into a game of survival.After a rip-roaring opening chase sequence, Max is held captive in the Citadel, the city where the ruthlessly totalitarian leader ""Joe"" is ruling over. The grotesquely brutal lord maintains tight grip of every valuable resouces across the land. This brings the entire populace crippling under his control. As for Max, he becomes merely a blood bag for Nux (Nick Hoult) one of Joe's War Boys, who is a fatal devout to the cause of their fascist leader, who has promised them the glory of getting into Valhalla, the promised land.Everything in this cinematic behemoth screams grandeur, even the feverish chase, even the dark erubescents spurred from the ruthless violence. Miller has molded a world where darkness is an escape from the stream of clichés and retreads, surging into the cinemas, today. It's a visual feast, but surprisingly, with sense. It's explosive in every unimaginable ways, but it's not devoid of a human story, which in this case, is propelled by stellar performances from incredible actors on the movie's payroll. Tom Hardy is utterly capable as the main hero, but the emotional spine of the narrative mostly runs on Theron's character. At some point, there would be a sense that Max isn't the only one playing under the spotlight, as it gets evident Furiosa is equally as massive as his role is. Hardy here is singularly stunning, playing his role with utmost credibility as he is required. His mission transcends past his emotional torments and he's never pulled himself free from the ghosts if his past. Same can be said with Furiosa, who is not only running from Joe because she wants to get herself free from his cut throat grip, but also to bring every woman into safety, back to freedom where they belong.Much of the movie is spent with furious speed chases that goes from end to end of Joe's subjugated land, while also taking surprising twists and turns along the way. It's like it doesn't know how to stop, and if it does, that's surely only to allow us breathe and catch up with the next electrifying action setpiece. There's an enigmatic style Miller has employed to provide distinctions in his fantasy world, and it keeps the momentum in tack, if not ever progressing. The tone of the movie, all those vividly dark colors, that magically shifts from something to another, imparts a drowning experience, only it's enjoying and looks festive to the eyes. This makes every eye-squashing spectacles take mammoth forms of visual extravaganza, turning all those burning combustions, metal blasts, and endless pursuits, from mere technical marvels into a hair-raising escapade.Amid these sanity-grabbing action sequences, though, is an emotional streak that keeps Max and Furiousa's humanity alive. This prompts them to survival, into carrying out their similar humane causes, clinging tightly to their only mission even if they get hurled into the barbaric hostilities of their dystopian society. This turns the movie into something visceral, cathartic in some ways that probably only a small fraction of the audience could understand. It will not be enough to merit this achievement with merely a splurge of superlatives. This needs to be experienced, felt, and forever cherished. MAD MAX: FURY ROAD, ignites eternal fire, and it will keep burning through the stretches of cinematic history."
"I saw the original mad max... it was violent, it had car battles, it had minimal character development. I had very realistic expectations going into the theater to see this new version.Never have I been more disappointed with a movie. The acting on both leads parts was mediocre at best, with the male lead switching from being well spoken to being capable of nothing but grunting.. The story line seems to have been written and edited by remedial English students, the characters are unbelievable and seriously lack any character development, it has horrible motorcycle stunts... and guys bouncing back and forth on poles of all things.and come on.. a flame-throwing guitar and fat women being milked for no explained reason to trade for gasoline to power the flame throwing guitar?... it's full of shitty clichés... badly cut scenes.. and lots of explosions. Save your money see anything else and you will be better off."
"Great film, so fast-paced it makes every other film out there look slow and old-fashioned. Wonderful to see George Miller back on the Australian road, where he belongs. Charlize Theron is great, Tom Hardy is not bad, but the stunts are really where the film shines. It's hard to think of a better action road movie. It has all the intensity and perversity of the MAD MAX and THE ROAD WARRIOR, but amped up to new heights of craziness. Miller is the real star of the film -- in some ways technology seems to have finally caught up with his early hyperactive camera style, and he takes full advantage of the ability to move wherever he wants, however he wants."
"This must be one of the worst movies of all time. 2 hours of shootings and blasts. There is a lot of action, but it is the same through the hole movie. People left the theater before the movie ended, There is no story. It's a chase for 2 hours, where the main character (should be) Mad Max has a role as a sidekick. The movie title should have been ""Furiousa"". Mad Max has only a few lines, and after each sentence, he growls. The movie starts of well, but after 15 min. It is downhill with silly conversation. Normally a good action movie should be entertaining and you Would leave the theater with a smile, but not here. Then in the middle, we have a lot of fire, shootings and blasts and a lot of stunt/animated scenes. But it does not have any power It's just the same over and over again. The end has a brief rise, but again ends poorly and foreseen. The old Mad Max movies starring Mel Gibson had power and lines with humor and bite. Maybe they are going for a new story in this movie.....but there is none to be found. Crap!"
"first of all , i am not fond of writing reviews pertaining to movies but this movie reluctantly compelled me to write a review for the first time. So lets start,i had been desperately waiting for this movie since long and today i got a chance to watch it and after watching it i was left agape with incredulity that how a movie like this is being applauded by the masses , Seriously it had nothing, except for extraordinary nonsense action. This movie is devoid of a sane story but in fact according to me it neither have a story nor a plot and regretfully i have to say that this is the worst movie i have seen in recent history. Mad max fury road is highly overrated and is mocking other movies which have ratings between 8 and 8.7. Albeit, I am a huge fan of Tom Hardy and Chalize Therone but their acting could not save it from becoming a complete ruin. i am giving it a one point and seriously if there had been an option to rate a movie below one point then i would have given it much lower points. Its also a suggestion to IMDb developers that they should ameliorate the movie rating algorithm and incorporate an option that can rate movies below the current lowest mark so that people should rate according to their aspirations. Finally i am exhorting that do not watch this movie its a detestable and a ridiculous movie."
"I will be honest with readers. I only really watched the first 30 minutes of this Hollywood blockbuster. What I did do before I settled down to watch it, was look at the rating on IMDb. 8.6 out of 10!! This must be great, like many other reviewers, I believe my low rating is a reaction to the absolute travesty that many movies are being rated so highly. The original Mad Max movies had a young and charismatic, unknown Australian actor called Mel Gibson in them. They had some plot and believability. This had so much money thrown at it, supposedly around $150 million, that the whole world view of Mad Max was gone. Hundreds of vehicles driving around in the desert. A community of thousands, with clearly no problem with water or food, even though the baddie turns on the water and lets in pour into the sand and then turns it off, and tells his people not to become addicted to water ??? Words are failing me, to describe how badly I feel. Any young people out there reading this, should watch Mad Max 1-2, skip the Hollywood version, thunderdome. Honestly, once again left speechless with the true awfulness of this film."
"It is almost hard too put into words how bad this movie was: The plot was virtually nonexistent , Most of the acting (bar Hardy and Theoren) was absolutely diabolical ,The script was like a ten year old wrote it, And Oh My God what was with that guy and the flaming guitar???Before you assume that I hate action films and that I am only giving this movie a bad review because I hate action films. Your wrong. Action is my favorite movie genre , and I was so excited to see this movie , but during the film I actually found myself checking my watch every five or ten minutes because it dragged on for so long , and for what ? Absolutely nothing.This is probably one of the worst action films I have ever seen in my entire life and I do not recommend it too anybody. The only really good thing about this movie was the visual effects , which where great.Final verdict : 3/10"
"I believe this to be one of the first reviews I ever wrote about a movie on IMDb, but I just cannot understand what all the hype about this movie is about! Seriously! #30 in the Top#250 !? Are you all kidding me?1 This has got to be one of the worst movies I've seen in a very very long time! I love action movies, so this is not coming from a ""The Notebook"" kind of guy, but seriously, there is nothing nothing good about this movie, it's borderline (if not full-on) ridiculous! A chained guy playing a flame throwing guitar?! Does it look cool? Yes, but in a very joke-like kind of way, they seriously can't expect to be taken seriously, or expect anyone to think that in whatever post-apocalyptic scenario the world turns to, that is ever going to happen, so it is obviously to be taken as a joke, pretty much like 50% of the whole movie! Ohhh and talking about 50% of the whole movie, yeah, where did that go? Cos I could swear that they played the movie half-way through, and then just rewinded it back to the beginning. What a stupid movie! They spend half to movie trying to get somewhere, and when they get there (only to be greeted by the bad ass granny's, again, not ridiculous at all) they come to the conclusion that they have to go back to where they came from, and you get to see THE EXACT same stuff you had just seen 30 minutes before. What a pathetic excuse for a movie, I mean, half a movie. There is not even an attempt of a storyline! ohh and all these pseudo intellectual movie reviewers will try and convince you that it is a master piece because there are no pauses in the action to spoon feed you the information or storyline... what storyline?! Save yourself $10 and here is for you the whole movie, Silent Max (Hardy)(definitely not MAD) appears on screen and tells us about his bad ass life in this post-apocalyptic world. I wonder how he survived this far, since he is captured 5 minutes into the movie and taken to this Badguys Headquarter Mountians where he is to be drained of his blood to feed some even weirder baddies (Hoult). Then, Furiosa (Theron) is supposed to go on this whatever fuel run for this outlaw Ruler, Immortal Joe and flees with his pet girlfriends, so ALL of the bad guys in the WHOLE WORLD, decide to chase them. They spend half the movie running from them, in this busted down truck always dragging with them this HUGE ASS semi-trailer that apparently is filled with breast milk (mothers milk?)! Seriously? They get stuck in mud and all sorts of disasters, but GOD forbid they would ever just, unhook the semi-trailer, for whatever reason that is. They finally get to where they are going, to be greeted by 80 year old Amazon fighters! LOL, that somehow have survived for soo long is this God Forsaken world. They tell Furiosa, that the GreenLands are gone, so they decided to go back to where they came from, since all the baddies were on the road chasing them, and there was no one left holding the fort. So they start making they're way back, through all the baddies again, on her way back to where they were in the beginning of the movie. In the return sector, you see the exact same movie that you have just seen for the first half. The get there, with the dead body of Immortal Joe (yep, he died.) and become the ruler (I guess) of these Mountains that miraculously has tons of water, that no one has any clue where it comes from. Max leaves! The Pathetic End!"
I was so amped for Mad Max after seeing the average review was high... WTF? Is it mob mentality or is it crafty advertising because this movie was not good... No character arcs except for Nux and his was so contrived and abrupt that it shouldn't count... the basic story was very lame... the plot was goofy... all the 2D character villains with their bizarre mutations (the hovering baby-man? This movie had shades of Total Recall)... 12 year old boys should like this movie ... When Furiosa walked sadly into the desert and took off her robot arm that was very poorly done... I wanted to scoff out loud but I didn't because I was in a theater... but I'm sure many there would have appreciated it... I see in the user review section that there are a significant number of equally bad reviews... thank you to those intelligent members of the IMDb community for the support... so I don't think I'm insane as Mad Max too for not liking a popular movie... I'll investigate the user reviews here more closely next time so I don't get burned again... I still hope to see some awesome Furiosa cosplayers in the future so that adds a few stars.
"Complicated hero who is easy to latch onto. Fantastic plot that is plausible in this environment. Terrifying nemesis, horrifying and relentless. Non-stop action and brilliant stunt sequences that will make you cringe. This movie will have you feeling parched and gritty. Usually Not a fan of 3d - however, it works perfectly here. This movie has managed to honor the previous films without being clunky about it. if you love mutant vehicles, art cars, burning man, etc. you will be satisfied. A few scenes that were taking place in cobbled together 1000 hp vehicles at 50mph where it was quieter inside than a modern Cadillac - the absence of the din of machinery for the sake of dialogue was the only thing that bothered me."
"'Mad Max: Fury Road' is the 4th installment in mastermind, George Miller's insane post apocalyptic journey. Starring Charlize Theron (Monster, Hancock) Tom Hardy (The Dark Knight Rises) Nicholas Hoult (About a Boy) and (Hugh Kaeys-Byrn) as the movies villain Immortan Joe.Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) is assigned to a mission. The mission is to drive the war rig and go through to the next town and siphon gasoline. Furiosa ends up double crossing Immortan Joe and stealing his 5 wives to take them back to her homeland where they can be safe. Along side her is Max, a man of action and very few words. Together they must fight trough hordes of enemies in what is basically a 2 hour long, high speed chase.I have been waiting since I heard about the green lighting of this movie back in 2009. I have been waiting for almost 6 years for this thing. My hype was high, I wasn't sure it would live up to my expectations. Well I am here to tell you that it did. It lived up to the hype, AND THEN SOME. This movie is absolutely, 1000% insane. What you saw in the trailers wasn't even close to the level of crazy that goes down in this movie. You know this movie is pretty much just all out, balls to the wall action, so if you think the trailers maybe showed off a little too much. You couldn't be more wrong.The stunt work is choreographed and directed to perfection, it is the most well crafted and stunning movie I've ever seen and will probably ever see, which is kind of the norm and what to expect with a George Miller movie. There's explosions going off everywhere, cars blowing up left, right and center, people being killed and blown to shreds. But none of it is convoluted, it all streams together perfectly, you know what is happening, when it happens. The fact that pretty much 90% of this movie is all practical effects and all stunt work is mind blowing. The cars that explode, that's happening. People bouncing from one side to the other on long poles at 60mph, picking people up and flying then back across, that's going down, too. Too many blockbusters these days are filled with CGI. And even with limitless amounts of stuff you can do with all of that. NONE of it even is even comparable to the action in this movie. The crap that goes down here, other movies couldn't even dream to aspire towards such a spectacle.People complain that there's not much of a story, they wanted more. Well I gotta tell you, the story is just what it needs. For something to be great it doesn't need to be a vibrant cohesive piece of art. The story is very simple, and the simplicity of it is what makes it great. There's enough story to keep you paying attention to it and not just going in for explosions. Not to mention that It's not driven through its narrative or its dialog. It's driven by its characters and its action. To which people also said they were underdeveloped and weren't written very well, from my stand point they absolutely were.The character of Nux (Nicholas Hoult) was developed amazingly well, I didn't really expect to see much from him but he really became his own in this movie. He was developed enough to make you care, he was written to be understandable in his actions and he was by far, for me, one of the best things about the movie. Furiosa was also developed just enough to make you feel something for her character. She's one of the only good left in a world full of bad. What Miller does in this movie is make characters that not only do you are for but are also incredibly likable and super bad ass. Max wasn't developed as much as some of the others but let's face it. If you've watched the older ones (which I recommend you do) There really isn't much to him. He's a man that's had everything taken from him and he has nothing left to lose. All he wants is to be left in peace. That's all he's every been and that's all he wants to carry on being.What I also love about this movie is that the lead character is a woman. Hollywood these days are always depicting women who need a man take care of them. That they can't live without men. That is DEFINITELY not the case with this movie. Furiosa is fierce, she's skilled, she's unpredictable and she's all out bad ass. This is a testosterone filled movie but it's not the testosterone that takes charge.Action movies these days aren't normally as good as one of the reasons being is that the hero is never really in any really danger. If he's never in danger or near death how can you possible expect to have your audience on the edge of their seats. Pondering what if the inevitable happened. Max was in peril SO MANY TIMES in this film. There was at least 10 times where I thought ""this is the end, he's going to die"" then he miraculously gets out of it. But it's not the cliché type when someone luckily comes along at the last moment and saves him. Believe me there aren't many, if any clichés in this movie. He fights his way out of these death defying situations. Furiosa out other lead is also in life threatening situations throughout this movie. Many times where we wouldn't know if she would make it.If you don't see Mad Max: Fury Road in the theaters then you are missing out. I went in IMAX and I can tell you it was worth every goddamn penny. Papa want a sequel"
"To be honest I went into watching this film with a negative mind anyway as I had heard that it was just crazy people driving round a desert. They were not wrong. It was terrible. Tom hardy just grunts most of the time and it is called mad max but it is barely about him. He doesn't do much in it. It is just people driving through the desert with unexplained things happening in it. And then when I finally had a feeling of relief because I thought the film had ended it hadn't, they pick up some old ladies and turn back round and go down the same way they just came from to have very similar fights, in the same places, with the same people except the old ladies they pick up die. So it's just pointless but rubbish fighting all the way through with big cars, lots of fire and no good story. This is a typical boys film. I normally love action films with cars and fights but this was just repetitive and boring.it didn't excite me, make me laugh, shock me or make me want to know what was going to happen next. Waste of two hours of my life."
"There is no way to review this movie without spoiling it.So: spoiler warning has been issued.The scenes are not built up in any way and the characters have no depth in them. This is not the Mad Max we've familiar with.The entire film consists of two scenes: first they drive one way and then they drive back. The end.Lot's of explosions and weird looking vehicles taking part in a road war on a post apocalyptic world. Absolutely boring and unrelated to the earlier Mad Max movies.There is no reasoning behind the actions the characters are making. Everything they do is either purely mindless or just plain stupid.Despite the obvious flaws in the script, Tom Hardy is excellent as Max. He is tormented, strong and intriguing. I really would have hoped for a more meaningful story for him to go with."
"2 hrs of wasted time. Nothing but chasing. At least the original at the time was worth watching and at least had a story line. I'm so tired of someone trying to remake a movie just for the money. I guess they forget about the people who have seen the original and try to impress the new comers who don't know what the hell they're watching but a stupid action flick. Wake up directors. I could make a better movie than you. 98%, really? Way to push people to watch a awful movie. Hopefully there will be a better remake of this movie one day. Hollywood needs to stop with the remakes and come out with some original story lines."
"Mad Max Fury Road is a stunningly beautiful and highly charged kinetic thrill ride. It is brilliantly filmed with amazing, and well suited bombastic soundtrack. The star of the film is its direction by George Miller, showing generation MTV how to direct moving action without getting lost in its mayhem. Almost every shot is moving, similar to a James Cameron action sequence. As mentioned before the film has not got much of a plot other then a giant chase. The first half of the film is great and the second half starts to loose steam due to what has come before it. Chalize Theron is great and adds presence to the film, it is one of her best performances. Tom Hardy gives a solid performance but I found his performance somewhat lacking, he does not have much to work with and is limited to a handful of dialogue, I preferred Mel Gibson's Max. The film suffers when it eventually slows down in pace, but when it is going full throttle there are not many films that can complete with it. Is it an action classic? as a chase film , yes I would say it is, along with set design and stunt work involved But the lack of any real story and small plot holes stop me giving this film a 10, not much is explained in the film. The ending seems sudden and could of done with some more depth to it, especially the Max character. It is still a wonderful and refreshingly directed film to add to the Mad Max Cannon of films."
"It was saddening to watch the movie. No matter how much I try to put it in words, I fail to describe how bad it is.There is a dominant warrior heroine (Charlize Theron) and totally out of place beauties who do not belong to that world. (Ms. Theron is utterly beautiful herself but she was not depicted as such in the movie.) We have no idea about what happened to the world neither about why we have a mix of 40s-80s cars, 18th century to 19th century weapons and tech that we do not know as of yet.CG was outdated, action was bad, and reasons why certain actions have been taken and their consequences were also very disappointing.I would say do not even bother watching this. Originals were OK, this is just a waste of time."
"Cold-blooded, botanically medieval, crusades-like, and horrifically thrilling—that's Fury Road. As for Max, it looks like he's the same archetypal Bane, only this time, he's more immune to ""I'm not afraid, I'm angry."" He's silent, and angry, and frustrated. He's Rango-like, reflective of the quest to solve the water-mystery. With everything red, orange, and yellow, it seems like you're viewing 300 blended in Saw, and over-the-top F&F.George Miller revises his ideological construct in the most exhilarating, dreadful, and striking manner this time. For all I know, the audiences spoil themselves with ""cinematic orgasms,"" if that's a thing, throughout the movie. They're not afraid of the porcupine-trucks, maybe a little on the edge of madness, but that goes without saying. Here's a hint as to what it was like: Bane and Miranda beating the beep out of war-painted, anti-Christian, Hulu tribe—only this time, it's some dark, full-raged action with mountain bikes, and trucks, and springy tentacles moving idiotic half-Willy, half-Wonka The Da Vinci Code Bettany's horrendous versions. Miller puts his tribal culture in the crux of action, which reveals an unorthodox, authoritarian, and devout portrayal of enmity. The sport-arena action is complemented by prayers in Citadel, banging of drums, skeleton-wheels, and skeleton-feels. It has a bizarre feeling—you're dredged into the modernity of Prometheus and antediluvian era of the Exodus.More than anything—Max's deafening seriousness, Furiosa's bald-grace, armless-attraction, sense of responsibility, and and absolute congeniality to the role (always imposingly remarkable,) religious affirmation, banging, puffing, booming, clatter, splash, tick-tick, boom—the ""fantasized-realism"" behind all the get-off-my-property-you-crazy-lunatic is what gives you the honesty-chills. The stunts, the effort, the don't-care-about-ourselves-just-love-the-movie-please pledge, and the extraordinarily enormous—480 hours of footage into 120 minutes of freaking-awesome warfare—blows me off of my seat in the cinema to the pale, scorching blaze of the sun, amidst the crazy-eyes of this action-genre Orange is the New Black. Even the over-editing has that medieval, darkly comical feel to it, just like 300 for example (can't think of another movie with such aberrant effects, but such positive response.) But like any other movie, there are points where you start questioning yourself. Nothing seems to justify Max & Furiosa's relationship, mutual combats, strategies, certainty of plans, and stuff like that. But by then, the movie's not about logic or sense anymore; it's more about seeing what you wouldn't in ages. With such a brilliant ensemble—I mean it was pretty good for a solely madness-based movie—you couldn't care less about the abacus-loving dumb-toads sitting in exactly the middle seats of the theater to get the most balanced view of the screen, and judge the minus-plus of the 120 minute long clip. I feel like reporting their stupidity to the CIA—enough with the pen and paper!Mad Max comes equitably with the characters, their roles, and the titular projections. Each name is qualified by its corresponding characteristic with the character in the movie—Spikers, Rictus Erectus et cetera. This complements the heartfelt glow to the movie itself—everything's done for the movie. They didn't feel any need to impose worldly sense into it, which is the best part, because that miniature world seemed pretty damn believable to me—but why? Maybe it were those religious beats, maybe the dragon-roars of engines, maybe it was just the psychological effect. Whatever it was, it did what it planned to.Mad Max: Fury Road puts forth the idea that there's so much more to combats than mere combats—MMFR incorporates belligerent, spoiling-for-a-fight attitude, oppressed landscape, estranged and barbaric drug-lords, heavy-weight weaponry and wheelers, and poster-paint bombings. The intensified red-blaze of fire, the sandstorm-effect, the preposterous turn of events, the nonsensical touch of things, and the wacky script—everything wrong with the movie is everything good about the movie. Mad Max: Fury Road revises the post-apocalyptic scene—utter dryness of region and minds—and uses the irritating sense of that dryness into a rigorous will to get past it with victory—Fury Road's victory. It's not about the comparative analysis of protagonists and the white-witty-wackos, it's about what's happening throughout. And when it happens, you're only remark is: ""What a lovely day."""
"Overall Rating: 4.5 stars Cinematic value: 4.5 stars Big questions value: 4 stars Family value: 2 stars (This film has a mature rating due to the violence, take this into consideration before viewing)We have not seen Max Rockastansky (Tom Hardy) on movie screens in 30 years. This is a welcome return to Max and the crazy, post-apocalyptic world of George Miller (Mad Max, Babe). Max lives an existence of sheer survival. As a former police officer and family man, he is now a tortured shell of the man of justice he used to be and merely wants to survive. After being captured by the leading cult forces of this futuristic wasteland, he finds himself in the middle of a pursuit of Furiosa (Charlize Theron) and the wives of the masked Immortan Joe (Hugh Keyes-Byrne). Max becomes the pivotal force to assist in Furiosa's escape and redemption. Mad Max: Fury Road becomes a race for life, redemption and hope. Shot in the barren desert of Namibia, the fight for life becomes an adrenaline charged chess match that in making the wrong move will cost you your life. No summary can do the action justice, except to say to is a new visual standard that needs to be experienced. Mad Max: Fury Road is a lesson in conveying depth with minimal dialogue. George Miller delivers a masters class in story telling and stunt driven effects that successfully convey back story, cultural nuance and the justification of these desperate acts of disobedience and violence. Even as the fourth outing for this character, we are given a fresh storyline and wealth of new characters for a new generation. It is not necessary to see the original films to enjoy this chapter in Max's adventures, but it might be worth going back to watch the first two films in this anthology. The cast is captivating and effective in their roles, but they have to take a back seat to the energetic stunt work and effects. This world seems to be a maniacal and messy existence, but becomes an enjoyable, orchestrated primal experience. Who would have thought that through the Mad Max franchise Miller would be able to convey his cinematic brilliance and deliver this visceral masterpiece. Not to dismiss the acting, Hardy is brilliant as the tortured lead character and delivering a believable portrait of his desire to survive the present while mentally enduring his past. He is given minimal dialogue, but is able to become the heart of this post-apocalyptic tale. Interestingly, Hardy is not the primary lead in the film that bears his name. Charlie Theron's shining portrayal of Furiosa is the literal and figurative driver of the film. She manages to redefine feminine heroism for film makers. She has strength, purpose and a sacrificial depth that presses the story beyond a mindless chase scene. In a genre that tends to victimise or sexualise the female leads, Miller portrays a strong female led without any unnecessary feminist underpinnings. In masking her natural beauty, Theron is allowed to develop her strengths and vulnerabilities without making a political statement. Both Hardy and Theron are supported by an excellent supporting cast that moves this experience from a mere adrenaline rush to a story of fighting for your right to live, seeing that sacrifice is part of freedom and ultimately for the hope for redemption. On many levels, Miller seems to realise that action without reason loses its purpose. In adding a spiritual component to Mad Max: Fury Road he allows for a narrative depth in the script. Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) is the cult leader in this dark, twisted world. His character delivers a dark and demented message of the need for effective leadership and that leaders need to provide people with purpose for their sacrifice, even if it is misplaced. This story shows that there is basic need for something beyond our material needs that gives society drive and direction. Also, the flower on this desert wasteland is hope. Even the jaded heart of Max is turned and assists in getting those under his charge to their promised land and in giving them hope in the bleakest of moments. This is an essential cinematic vehicle when placed against the backdrop of the depravity of mankind. Miller manages to capture this element and allows for the story to consider the realities of mankind's history and future. If the film does have a weakness, it would be in the conclusion. In all that they desire to achieve and find through this film maker's journey, the finality has an empty satisfaction. After watching a film like Mad Max : Fury Road it might be worth reading through Revelation. Fortunately, with the God of the Bible there is more we can hope for in the future.Reel Dialogue: What are some of the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. Where is real hope found? (Deuteronomy 31:6, Romans 5:2-5) 2. Can we find true redemption? (Psalm 111:9, 1 Corinthians 1:30) 3. Can we exist without others? (Proverbs 18:1, 1 Corinthians 12:14)Written by Russell Matthews based on a five star rating system @ Russelling Reviews #russellingreviews #madmaxfuryroad"
"I hated this movie. I never got into the world or the characters. Perhaps it was the Mad Max of old and my nostalgia for that world but this was so different and less real than the world of the original Max. Max was leaden. He seemed almost irrelevant and I couldn't care for him. Furiousa was better and brought some interest to the adventure. Nux was just Nicholas Hoult in bad make-up. I don't generally like movies with endless fight and action scenes and this pushed that genre to the extreme. In the end it was plot free, character free nonsense.But. I can understand the appeal both to the action fan and to wider cinema audiences. The visuals were stunning, the world was unique and the pace and intensity was startling. Immerse yourself in the world and the action and I could understand this could reach 10 out of 10 proportions. I never got there and sadly hated every minute. Just a personal view."
"Anyone that gives this a bad review just doesn't enjoy movies. Intense action, interesting characters, and bloody good fun. An all around great summer movie. The people that complain about there being no plot and need to be more informed about the world of fire and blood that is Mad Max are insane and need to watch the first three for a little background. I was impressed with the depth of this movie with vibrant characters and in camera visuals 80% done in camera and very little CGI. Miller adds more depth to his apocalyptic world in a way never before seen. He makes you feel the pain these people are going through. It is one of those movies that are few and far between and should be seen as the amazing goose bump riddled spectacle that it truly is. Nonstop over the top edge of your seat fun. The production is over the top and every scene is filled to the brim with eye candy. Don't listen to these people spouting crappy reviews they are the same people who wouldn't know a great movie if it sat on their face and wiggled around and they loved glitter. Make it your summer goal to go see this film in the theater you will not be left wanting anything but a sequel. Oh what a lovely day! And an even better movie."
"Let me start by saying this. This movie is MAD. The title was not lying. This film was exactly what one wants from a summer blockbuster. George Miller has come out publicly and said that this is neither really a reboot or a sequel. This is simply another story following Max Rockatansky. In this story, we see Max being captured By Immortan Joe and his band of War Boys. Once he escapes he comes upon Imperator Furiosa who is attempting to rescue the ""wives"" from the oppression of Immortan Joe. Cue action. I love how sometimes simple plots like this can set up an entire world of action. In the action genre, we don't need very convoluted and intricate plots that keep taking unexpected twists and turns. In Mad Max: Fury Road's case, the simpler, the better.Now on to what everyone is wondering about. The action. And yes, the stunts and music when it's all going down is some of the best action ever put to screen. By the time the climactic chase rolls around, the action is even more jaw-dropping and breath taking than before because the stakes continue to be raised. This movie is a two hour chase that never has a dull moment.As for the characters, they were all spectacular. Especially Furiosa, played beautifully by Charlize Theron. Though she is a bad-ass, she never upstages Hardy as Max. Being the emotional core of the film, playing Furiosa was one of the harder tasks to correctly perform and Theron knocked it out of the park. For Tom Hardy as Max, he was just as great as Theron. Having minimal dialog and mainly using grunts to show emotion, Hardy gave Max a surprising amount of depth, though still not nearly as much as Furiosa. This is not a bad thing however, since Max was never a truly deep character, he was an action star who kicked a lot of ass. And of course he does that in this film. The rest of the characters were played great as well especially Nux (played by Nicholas Hoult) who brought even more emotional depth this.Overall, this is a gleefully insane film. The relentless pace never holds back on the audience and it always has them glued to the edges of their seats. If you can, I highly recommend everyone does themselves a favor and witness this master-class action phenomenon that will arguably go down as one of the finest action films ever made."
"There's little point in rehashing what others have said about this ""film."" To do so would require more effort than the producers expended. It's mindless, careless, utterly disposable drivel. Give me five minutes with any scene, if they can properly be called scenes, and I'll give you vastly superior results. Not because I'm an expert film maker, but simply because I care. I care about great titles from my younger years. I care about the craft of movie making -- good acting and inspired casting, with quotable dialog that involves the audience and makes them feel for the protagonists and despise the villains. I care about smart story with detail that paints a vibrant picture of another world, one that helps us understand our own. I care about dramatic tension and pacing, plot twists and strategies, and fresh ideas that show me something I haven't seen before.None of those elements can be found in Fury Road. It's simply a long action reel with superficial Max Max theming. Video games have better plot. George Miller clearly doesn't care anymore, or has simply lost what talent he had.The only interesting thing here for me is the wild and unprecedented disparity between ratings. One star or ten? Are you kidding me? Sample the writing from praisers and notice the slick marketing language and textbook film school speak. Are these people who can't discern packaging from product, a la unboxing videos? Was a substantial portion of the budget spent on an army of film industry shills? I don't know. But perhaps IMDb's review and rating system has been compromised. Trust me, those of you who think you honestly liked this movie -- it will be forgotten in a year, and you won't be coming back to it in five, fifteen, or thirty years. There's nothing to come back to. Even Thunderdome is a masterpiece compared to this abomination. I'm just glad I didn't actually have to pay to be insulted."
"Warning: this review is full of spoilers! Here it is, the future consists of a whole bunch of really ugly people, some feeding on breast milk, others on live reptiles and bugs, driving ugly souped- up trucks that spit flames while play drums and guitar and chasing and shooting at each other. Some are looking for a place that does not exist, the others are trying to kill them because they were supposed to deliver gasoline to another bunch really ugly people with nothing else to do than blowing up rocks if they don't get their gasoline. It is between a redneck's dream and plain redneck hell. Could it be both? Yes it certainly could. So what does this movie have a 8.7 rating on IMDb? Well I'm asking you, whoever it is that knows the answer. Something's got to be wrong somewhere.. Ratings are usually pretty accurate but in my opinion it is way off base for this particular movie, Oh I forgot, of course there is no apparent plot, nothing is said about why anything is happening, why the characters are where they are, why they doing whatever they seem to be doing. Not even funny, just plain ugly, violent, senseless, aimless, rolling junk. I want my two hours back."
"First I loved the original Mad Max films, OK Thunderdome was a bit iffy but it was OK. This has to be the worst film I have seen this year and I was so looking forward to it. I have seen others call it a masterpiece or work or genius. I don't know what planet they are living on.. No real story and Tom Hardy who is a great actor only spoke about 25 lines in the whole movie. The actions scenes are great and the whole film is action scenes but we know nothing about the characters. Most of the film seems to be a rehash of the chase at the end of Mad Max 2 But with Mad max 2 there was a character build up.This is one film I will not be adding to my DVD collection If I had paid to see this I would be knocking down the door for a refund!!!"
"Water is a scarce resource so when it is dispensed and made available to the populace it is by opening a valve of some sort that allows it to cascade from a cliff face and down onto an arid dry dessert floor bed. Some people have cups, mugs and buckets to catch it in, so hey it's not a total waste. We see some water in the film, but no sign of food apart from the two headed mutant lizard Mad Max stamps on and eats, there really isn't any implication of how anyone gets a meal in a dessert with no water and the occasional lizard or bug. Despite this there is a demigod like figure who is worshipped by a populace of thousands. Not really the every man for himself, dog eat dog world of the future one may have been expecting then.And as for where the gasoline is coming from, well what does that matter, even though oil was the principle cause for conflict in all previous films as it was the most valuable commodity it's not even an issue here even though it's the stuff that sustains the film's entire action sequence.The flashbacks imply Mad Max's past, we see them at the beginning when he's being pursued by some sort of dance troupe in make up, or the bad guys. What the dessert lack's in water is compensated by a tremendous amount of white powder and dark eyeliner. But really the film just becomes very monotonous and even giving the film this amount of attention is quite undeserving of the film itself."
"What a waste of time this crap movie was. If you want to see acrobats on stick driving through a desert with lots of explosions and no reason to do so, this is your movie. If you go to this movie expecting something as good as the original, do not bother, just a boring peace of crap with no back story no character development, nothing. The whole cast could have died on the end and I wouldn't give a rats ass. The acting of Charlize was great, tom hardy did the same as he did in the drop, the dark knight and all his other movies. The movie setting was great and there was something with water and people driving around, getting away from stuff and returning to it. Oh and something with woman and mothers milk. Horrible piece of crap."
"Way to go America, stuff up another good yarn! Absolute rubbish, there is no story, no acting and it is an altogether pathetic attempt at entertainment...the main actors have submitted an incredibly wooden performance with Tom Hardy doing a merely token bit part that seems to require nothing but stupid looks and constant confusion, and Charlize Theron attempting to unsuccessfully convey some semblance of acting ability.Good grief, who are they aiming this rubbish at...two year olds? P.S. and the half-wits that are waxing lyrical about it should take the time to wipe their collective chin."
"The engines start roaring and without warning, you've fallen into this completely demented and absurd world - over the top and ridiculous - in Fury Road, Madness reigns. The shock is so great that even if you're familiar with the universe, it may take you a while to swallow everything, to get all the visual clues, to try to understand what is happening and how you can believe and embrace such a ludicrous world, but once you do, and you will, Fury Road takes you in an exhilarating ride.With a minimal plot and as little dialog as possible, Mad Max is a triumph on visual storytelling. Supported by the most epically constructed action scenes in years (or ever) and by unmatched imagination (or insanity), this two-hour car chase proves to be a lot more than a loud quest for gasoline. You'll be stunned by the action, but ultimately, left wondering what it all means - and suddenly Fury Road doesn't look that mad anymore.Ultimately, the most surprising thing about Fury Road is that Max is still there, as silent as ever, but its Furiosa, beautifully played by Charlize Theron who owns this brutal and glorious extravaganza."
"Pro's: This was not the worst movie I've seen. If it hadn't been called a Mad Max film I'd have given it a 3 or 4. So a -3 points for deception.Con's: This is not a Mad max film. His character is entirely irrelevant. He plays no role in the development of the plot (such as it is). None of the male characters are really relevant except the arch-villain (and his role is VERY limited). The central character is Charlize's ""Furiosa"". The acting is generally very unconvincing. There is no real story being told here. It is without a doubt the worst of the mad max lineup, if you even count it as being a mad max film (I don't). At no point did I reach the level needed for voluntary suspension of disbelief. This is a very silly movie, and not in a good way like Willy Wonka. There were numerous other issues too. I'll leave off them so as to avoid any spoilers for those who plan to see it.Bottom line I walked away from the film feeling as if I had duped. I went to see a Mad max film and got ""Furiosa, girl power"". I recommend renting and viewing Mad Max 1 or 2 again and giving this one a pass."
"5 min into this movie and i was fighting the urge to stick a needle in my eye...i forced myself through this steaming pile of dog .... just to make sure i wasn't jumping the conclusions and i wasn't. Mad Max: Fury Road tries so desperately to be madly violent and grotesque, bloody and hardcore, but FAILS miserably - script is just stupid and feels like its written by five year old. Story line and all these so called special effects with obscene scenes made me feel like the director and writer (maybe all crew) was trippin' on LSD. Needless to say, there was no acting whatsoever... Oh and since when the Kamikazes are going to Valhalla after they die???"
"George Miller has proved you don't need to actually make a movie in order to make money making movies. You see, movies typically have certain key features, such as: a plot, dialogue, and character development (all of which are absent here). And is George Miller now just Frank Miller with a different hat?Anyone who was ""satisfied"" by this mindless smash-em-up dystopian mess should be ashamed and go do their homework on some ozploitaion, you know the kind of movies that inspired Quentin Tarantino to make Death Proof, a far more satisfying car movie. And let me be clear, without exaggeration, that Mad Max: Fury Road has the hands-down dumbest scenes I've ever seen in a movie, the ones where we see the large ""music"" truck with the drummers and the idiotic electric guitar player who inexplicably joins the soundtrack with solos and flames.Hands-down, dumbest. Ever. Worse than Jar-Jar.We really only get a half-movie, because the first half is stuff driving one way, then they turn around and do everything again in the opposite direction, leading to an ending so triumphant that all it lacked was a golden unicorn shooting rainbows out of its flaming ass. It is surely not a great feminist statement worthy of men's rights haterade.The climactic line: ""I'm Max."" And then Tom Hardy nods approval, as if to reassure himself that he is an actor and really can memorize such inane dialogue.I don't care if the action scenes looked cool. The movie is just plain stupid, so stupid it makes me want to huff some silver spray paint and go to Valhalla."
"Mad Max: Fury Road Review Just had the chance to watch this movie. Mad Max isn't so much a remake but rather a continuation of the story. It starts of with Max already in the post apocalyptic world. Where as Mad Max 1 was a prelude with still having some law enforcement in the world. and the rest of the series is set after all of the chaos breaks out. Fury Road is set in the same universe.The Story is fairly simple, but still enjoyable and loyal to the Mad Max Universe. Furiosa helps young women escape Immorten Joe and is headed for her childhood home. Through Actions of one of the War boys to tag along Max with him, They end up on the War Machine of Furiosa and end up trying to help become free.The Acting for most part wasn't bad. I do feel that Tom Hardy wasn't the best choice as I never really felt that he was mad like (Mel) he actually reminded me and my friends of his portrayal of Bane. His accent and voice were very close to the one he did in Bane, he also had very limited number of lines and that just made it more like Bane, not to mention that he carried himself as big guy with muscles, even though the whole time his body was covered, you felt his size in the film.Pacing is what i loved the most from the film. It had the perfect amount of actions separated with suspense moments to draw you back in before unloading more fast paced action. Right from the start we start of with some chases which don't just stop but actually slow down for you to be able to enjoy them a lot, and then the director uses the sense of character waiting and reaction shots to tell the story of action as to not over bore you with it. But most importantly the actions scenes are never the same and vary a lot. So that you don't have that feel, ""Oh its the same fight as before in the movie"" This is a very solid movie. I give two thumbs up to the director for actually making the film very well paced. Much better then Avengers Age of Ultron and all of the Transformer films, They both can take a lot away from his style. 8.5/10"
"After finally renting ""Fury Road"" online I'm completely baffled by the positive reviews it's gotten. Three elements made the original ""Mad Max"" movies work: the supercharged car and chase scenes, the shocking stunts often done with practical (real) effects, and Mel Gibson's portrayal of a post-apocalypse anti-hero who is hard and cynical, and the ultimate survivor.The first movie introduced this world, still in a society we knew but in the middle of a collapse into anarchy, and we see Max when he was a cop before he lost his family. The second movie took this world further where there was nothing left but roving gangs, and the infamous battle down the highway, with a few surprisingly deep philosophical questions. The third movie is where it jumped the shark; the car is gone, and instead the vehicles and people are like something out of a comic book. Max is guardian to a group of children and campy humor replaces cynical reality.""Fury Road"" is essentially ""Beyond Thunderdome"" remade on a huge budget. The supercharged pursuit interceptor is literally in it for maybe 5-10 seconds, and shows up briefly in a chase scene later.Absolutely nothing works; the action scenes appear to be deliberately sped up by probably 20% over normal film speed and the result is it feels like a hyped up and amateur martial arts movie. The spectacle is huge, but so overblown your mind doesn't think it's real. As an example of how silly it gets in the earlier movies they had nitrous, now someone literally climbs onto the hood and spits fuel into the intake. For some reason the pale albino foot soldiers have a thing for spraying their mouths with silver paint before doing something suicidal.I can remember in the ""Road Warrior"" when the female love interest is pulled off of the truck and Max literally steps out of the door at speed and dispatches the bad guy with a shotgun blast through the windshield; here so many flying bodies and explosions happen it all runs together.Guns were rare and often unreliable in the earlier movies, this made the idea of marauders doing battle with darts, arrows, and thrown weapons more plausible but also brought the action scenes into close up intensity. Now everyone has a firearm; there isn't a single paved road yet somehow the societies can keep high octane vehicles running.The producers went into overkill on outdoing each idea with a bigger or more bizarre one. One car has tank treads, for some reason the main villain has rows of pregnant women hooked up to milking machines. One bad guy is a portly businessman in a suit with a club foot and a prosthetic nose, yet holes cut in his clothing to expose his nipples. Many of the vehicles have the style of 2-3 car bodes stacked on top of each other. One of the bad guys is a blind guitarist on a rig that is like a giant sound system, the guitar doubling as a flamethrower. Whatever.Much has been made about the feminist aspect of this movie, but it's not really brought into focus, just another random idea tossed into the mix. Furiosa is passable, and seems more like Max than Tom Hardy. The entire gist of the story is the villain Immortan Joe is chasing her to get his prize harem back, which he calls his property. Furiosa has some sort of dark past behind her but it's never explained, and late in the movie she finds ""home"" which is a pack of motorcycle riding grandmother snipers. That's it, no message or depth beyond that.And finally Tom Hardy as Max---we see over and over hints that he is tormented by the loss of a child and spouse, but it's also never explained. Tom is quite literally just there, with none of the brutal vindictiveness that Gibson's version was capable of.Overall I don't think I've seen such a mess of a movie since ""Waterworld."""
"After This, any action movie is nothing ,don't waste your time after now trying to watch any action movie because after this i think no more action ,the best action movie of all time, but its so weird that you will never imagine your self the hero of the movie , this movie makes you feel how beautiful life we are living now ,i think the movie have a hidden massage in it and makes you know that hope is not for living with hope is also for dieing with ,it takes you from the first to the end ,and i think tom hardy is the best choice to be the new ""max"" after i go home i can't stop thinking of it ,and from now am waiting for the next amazing mad max am sure there will be another part of this ,George Miller this is a MasterPiece"
"Whilst the landscape and population are interesting, the film lacks any real story as such. Max (Tom Hardy) has the charisma and depth of a mouldy pair of underpants. Charlize Theron has one arm for some reason which is never really justified, although it does add something to her character which would have been put to better use with Max. The main villain, Immortan Joe is on of the better characters, albeit a rehashed version of Bane with Don Kings hair. He seemingly has two sons, one who is very small and disabled and the other who is a giant beast of a man. Yet again this is something the film makes no attempt to explain, which is a shame as it would add to the very thin plot.The vehicle design is outstanding and credit must be given to the engineers who put them together, assuming they aren't all CGI.To summarise the film they spend 50% of the runtime escaping the main villain and his henchmen only to turn back in the opposite direction to finish where they started."
"If you hate awe inspiring action sequences, little dialog, and post apocalyptic salvation movies you should watch this. You will. If you love those cinematic styling already then you should watch this. You will even more. See it in 3D, it is the type of experience that develops in it's own world with it's own identity separate from the previous installments and in plain enough terms for anyone to relate to. The inevitable visions, actors placed in the right situations, and ability to be long enough to tell the perfect time line but not grow stale make it a trip worth taking. Take it. There are no pointless moments or dead space, it utilizes every second to fill your quivering eyes with dazzle."
"Reasons to never see this movie: 1) There were so many explosions that, had I walked out of the theater and into a car bombing, I probably would not have noticed. 2) Max was a bumbling idiot that did almost nothing useful or productive in the entire movie. One or two small things, yes, but he spends the entire first 1/4 of the movie as a total spectator, which brings me to... 3) This movie could have been made without ever including Max. It had nothing to do with Max, as mentioned above he did nothing really useful, and he was almost the flattest and most emotionless character in the story. 4) It has little to do with reality or, frankly, physics. At one point there is a dust/thunder/tornado/lightning/darkness storm that has no apparent cause except to make the interminable chase seen different for a couple of minutes. 5) The villain? An overweight dude with no physical presence, dressed in clear plastic armour, and with a serious breathing issue. It's like if Darth Vader had lived to 150 and brutally interrogated a million donuts. He has no personality, and, basically, no lines worth noting. If he had been silent the entire time, it would have been better. 6) It makes no reference to the previous three movies. At all. Was this a reboot? Why even include Max then, since Max didn't have any actual impact? Oh, right. The ""franchise"". So George Miller made this movie trying to draw on his fan base for success? I don't know, but this is the truth... 7) I am a fan of the first three Mad Max movies. But my support of this franchise ends there. Like Aliens 3 and Terminator 3, there is nothing worth seeing here, unless you want two hours of explosion and nothing, nothing else."
"I've seen a lot of action movies probably seen them all, but nothing quite like this one. Fast-paced, entertaining. Beautiful fit between the desert ambiance, the action scenes and the visual effects. It has got the non stop action and movement of Crank, the speed car chasing of Fast & Furious, Michael Bay type of explosions and dynamic scenes but shot in a Christofer Nolan way. What a perfect opener. It will blow you away from the start to the finish. A guarantied two hours never stopping entertainment. Roaring engines, speed, shootings, fire, rust, dust really a must see. Anything else would be waste of words. Just go and see it!"
"Mad Max Fury Road follows a determined man named Max Rockatansky to wander the post-apocalyptic wasteland alone, Max surely joins Furiosa, a fugitive imperator, and her band who are all trying to escape a savage warlord and are trying to get to a safe haven. I really can't describe how in awe I was with this film, I was extremely impressed. The stunts, the makeup, the action & the camera shots were all so dead-on and did not fail to impress. One thing that kinda upsets me is that when the film ended and everyone was walking out, I overheard things like ""that was garbage"" or ""what a piece of sh*t film"", that really angered me a little because I know that a lot was put into this film and they think they can do better? Unbelievable. Anyway, this didn't dissatisfy me at all and let's talk about why it did! Even though this is supposed to be a action film, they added some slow moments just to emphasize more character and fondness toward each person which was fantastic. George Miller did such a satisfactory job with that. The action, don't let me forget about the action, this is what made the film so much more engaging to watch and I mean that with each insane character given, it made the action more fun and insane to watch. The score was unbelievable, I'll just leave it at that because you know, it was! Tom Hardy had some pretty big shoes to fill but yet he knocked it right out of the park with given so little dialogue to say, he still manages to be a complete badass. Same goes for Charlize Theron, she played such a cool character with some great sympathy for herself and the people shes protecting and yet she does have some sweet skills and the prosthetic arm was a nice touch. Also for Nicholas Hoult, he plays such a basket case that will do anything to impress Immortan Joe and yet, he starts to become a very likable character. I swear, the makeup in this was was so spot-on that I really believed that these were actually mental people and also I thought that half of the people in this looked like albinos which added more effect to the mental aspect of them. The camera angles in this were flawless it was unbelievable even with so much going on at the same time, George really managed to get a lot of what we had to see, wait, I mean we needed to see! Hugh Keays- Byrne did such a menacing job as Immortan Joe, he played the role as such a character that doesn't let anything get in his way and always gets what he wants but yet so insane. Yes, there was a lot of disturbing images in this that can probably make you gag a little, it's truly a sight for sore eyes of what I had to see in this but hey, we're talking about a Mad Max film here. The costume design was very odd as well which looked so deserted and worn that them fit so well each character. My favorite part of the film would have to be the beginning scene, George proved he really knows how to work a camera and really made the atmosphere of the situation Max was faced with, more exciting and intoxicating! Overall, I might of exaggerated in this review but who cares, it was worth it and I mean't every word of it and this film might possibly be a modern day masterpiece! With a 2 hour runtime, this film really seems to go by fast but yet who's worried about that when you're distracted by such insanity. Please guys, go see this action packed, pulse pounding & off the wall thrill ride to Fury Road with the Mad Man himself!"
"This Mad Max is supremely surreal/Dali, absolutely fascinating even. This one, like the first 3 films, we get to suspend disbelief as the movie projects, thrusting us into the post-apocalyptic world, with anthropological and sociological elements we could believe it. Don't get me wrong, this movie is the best of the series, the unforgivable. Mad Max and The Road Warrior were convincing in it's tribalism, brutality and uncompromising violence I'm sure is true is burned into my survivalist memory. I'm not a hater, but massive dune buggies, rock playing mutants and an oxygen breathing madman? No way. Miller, you messed up bad. What happened to Max, a ""shell of a man"" who hasn't quite lost his humanity, only long forgotten and buried it. In this way this movie pisses me off, in the same way ""The Phantom Menace"" did. And yet, 9 out of 10. MILLER, you'r awesome!!!"
"I loved this! Crazy, action-packed and violent, everything a mad max film should be.Oh also there's some boobs. Lovable characters and the new actor for Mad Max matches up to Mel Gibson in my mind.If you were thinking about seeing this, please do. I would recommend following the age guideline of 15+ though because of blood, gore, violence and......a certain unmasking.....if you see it you will know what i meanSeriously though, best film I've seen this year. Amazing. 10/10. Also one of the best apocalyptic films of all time in my opinion."
"When talking about remarkable action movies, a few titles come to mind. Movies like Die Hard, Terminator: Judgment Day, The Matrix and The Dark Knight are great examples of it. And if you're into this kind of film, congratulations. You've just won another golden ticket to the chocolate factory.Mad Max: Fury Road opens this summer as one of the best movies I have seen in the past decade. I have recently re watched the first three movies of the franchise to dive into this world once again. After I was done with it, I came to the same realization that I did a few years back. I did not like them at all. And as a consequence, I had no hope for this one. In my mind, it was going to be as mediocre as the others. Fortunately, I couldn't be more wrong. After three decades trying, George Miller has finally got it. That post-apocalyptic world he created 36 years ago is bigger, better and crazier than ever.If you are looking for a word to describe Fury Road, insane it is. It is visually stunning and packed with exhilarating action scenes. The execution is so impressive that you get yourself smiling in the middle of a gory scene. You can feel the effort and passion put into making this movie through the silver screen. The actors job in constructing the characters is so effective that you dive into this world almost instantaneously. Props to Hardy and Hoult who conducted their characters with talent, each one in their own crazy way. But specially to Theron for creating such an extraordinary and strong female character. Furiosa is simply amazing.Hard to be pleased by this kind of movie, I was blown away. It has been a while since I walked out from a movie theater with this amount of satisfaction. Fury Road can be disgusting and beautiful at the same time. It is unique. It has reached and stepped on the same ground as some of our beloved blockbusters from the past. But not only this, it has marked itself as a milestone in the action film history."
"The Action genre has always been mixed, ranging from trashy profit- searching rubbish to thrilling, adrenaline fuelling epics (see Terminator 2 and Aliens).Mad Max: Fury Road thankfully fits into the latter category, but it is fundamentally and wonderfully different. Out goes the usual CGI, explained back story and lack of enough good characters, and in comes a truly insane thrill ride, that somehow manages to make 2 hours of following a truck one of the most enjoyable things to watch in recent times.Let's go over the one thing that I disliked about this film (and honestly, dislike is a fairly strong word in this case): The exposition. Or rather, lack of it. The extreme pace of the film results in details seemingly whistling by, meaning it can leave you wondering whats going on. But then again, the actual story foundations for the film are so small that really, it doesn't matter that everything isn't explained. So long as we know the names of the characters and where they're heading to next, nothing else really matters.What it chooses to focus on is an excellent cast, lovely cinematography and wondrous, wondrous carnage. Practical effects take the lead role here, with amazing vehicles, well timed explosions and constant tension and thrill. The benefits of this are best seen with the big crashes and the huge fuel tanker explosion towards the end of the film; it ends up looking stunning. The Polecats really make the most of this, adding an extra layer of danger while cementing the realism that the film thrives off of.I also particularly loved the sheer attention to detail; every car is different and exceptionally well designed. Sound work is equally amazing, with the soundtrack being entwined with vast array of engine noises, explosions and, in the case of the Doof Wagon (which I'm now calling one of the coolest things I've ever seen in a movie, ever), live rock music. Performances from the cast are excellent. Tom Hardy's Max is very much the usual gritty, rock solid hero that Gibson portrayed all those years ago. Charlize Theron's Furiosa (isn't that just the best name you've ever heard?) really stands out for me, balancing out Hardy's character with a strong and bold performance. And for once, it's a female action hero who hasn't been raised or taught by other men - she's a real self empowered super lady. Nicholas Hoult's character is also a personal favorite, while the Brides and the Many Mothers created an ensemble of female characters that don't get wasted like they so often do in other action flicks. Everyone gives an enthusiastic performance, and it only adds to the quality of them film.There's plenty more to praise here, but I'll highlight some of my personal favorite aspects from the film: The make-up and costume departments did an incredible job here, giving us a massive range of extras that really diversify the entire film. There are plenty of great names and phrases used in the film, including ""Bloodbag"", ""Immortan Joe"", ""The Organic Mechanic"" and ""The Bullet Farmer"". The film seemed to obey the laws of physics for the most part, and was especially good at ridding any infinite-ammo guns or strangely enough, unnecessary explosions.In conclusion, I can't say anything that is inherently negative about Fury Road. It's fresh, bold and so well made that you can't help but be enthralled by its insanity. On the face of it, it's nothing more than a overly long car chase, and yet it isn't. It adds just enough complexity right where it's needed - the characters, vehicles and action. Combined with the great array of characters, sheer attention to detail and wonderful cinematography, it's actually unusually diverse, and its humane undertones only help to differ it from normal action films. And in that respect, it's one of the best films in recent history."
"George Miller's masterpiece Mad Max:Fury Road will definitely create tension and will leave on on the theater sweating and with no words as how epic this film was. Is shaping up to be as much a unique experience for longtime Max fans as it will be for those who've never before visited Miller's vision of a sun-scorched hellish post- apocalyptic world, populated largely by violent maniacs. So don't worry if you haven't seen the older movies, there is absolutely no need to. 120 minutes of vehicular carnage and craziness, this movie has all aspects it needed to be.""Fury Road"" is a beautifully realized vision of the post-apocalyptic future, filmed in Namibia but looking like it was another world. And almost no CGI was used, it felt like it was real as of how amazing cinematography was, this is why it will leave many other movies behind. Tom hardy as Max gives a wonderful performance as replacing Mel Gibson, the main character of the older mad Max movies. Also the other heroine Charlize Theron plays Furiosa really good as well. Having to cut her hair and giving her best indicates she is really into the roll of Furiosa, feminine form outside, but masculine form inside. In addition, the movie also had a good but simple plot, but it definitely didn't need a deep plot. Having not much dialog also helps other people from different countries to enjoy it, as they may not have subtitles. The music was phenomenal, only one time watching the movie is enough to enjoy and get it into your head, even some of the action is synchronized with the music. So i greatly recommend you to go and join this crazy ride, specially in 3D as Miller uses chucking arrows, bones, and parts of cars and bodies at you. 'What a lovely day' indeed.I give this movie a 10/10, and Im looking forward to see it again"
"Mad Max: Fury Road is a non-stop concerto of clanking iron, broken bones and splattering blood while fire squirts from all cylinders. It's absolutely glorious. As far as sci-fi world goes, director George Miller creates a remorseless realm with every bit of nastiness present. The two leading actors Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are utterly convincing, so much so audience would believe they are actual occupants of the unapologetic post-apocalyptic world.Max (Tom Hardy) is a survivor in a barren wasteland. He's about to cross path with totalitarian clan War Boys led by a dictator. As luck would have it he meets with Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) as situation escalates rapidly and they must fight for their survival. Tom Hardy looks physically menacing and exhausted by the burden he carries on the desolate landscape. He is more of an anti-hero who prioritizes his safety in the expense of his morality.Charlize Theron is utterly splendid. With short hair and one arm, she still manages to look beautiful and presentably strong. She seems cold yet also rigidly determines to her cause, this is a real rendition of a powerful female character, not a model shoehorned into the wilderness. Nicholas Hoult as Nux, one of the War Boys is a chameleon. His character might have the most development as a lowly peon who gradually discovers the true nature of his clan.Production value is exceptionally well done. From vehicles, make-up and even prosthetic limbs, all of them look as though they have wear and tear from the dusty world. Strange contraptions and weapons are aplenty, explosive spears are thrown with reckless abandon as large tank mounted with electric guitar rumbles in the background. It's brazenly unworldly and over-the-top spectacle. There is no such thing as too much here.Visual is all shades of tangerine. The vistas look dry and dirty yet still can be lively or solemn as the filter regularly changes. The soundtracks blast rock, metal and techno vibe with each scene. It truly doesn't let up, riding the momentum from start to finish, though it's not just mindless explosion. Its characters are identifiable, audience would be fascinated and cheer for them between each explosions.Never a murky world ridden with death and destruction seems so irresistibly invitingly. As the characters ride through the carnage, the film is an achievement in action and destruction."
Lets make one thing clear there is no way to say this movie was great.From the first second you are put right into a hostile environment where without any argument a man gets attacked. It stays unclear why (because it stays unclear why the half living needs its blood. that half living seems fine without it the rest of the film.) Though that isn't why i grade this movie so extremely low. The thing is that there is nothing more to the film than chasing each other till some key figure dies. Every moment i was watching for something new and impressive. Butt even the guitar/drum car was not loud enough to be that. The bomb sticks are immensely overrated and multiple armies can't take out one single truck loaded with water. There I named another point of annoyance the amount of water they keep with them in a car chase. Who takes a truck full of water to a chase? They could at least have dumped some to be a bit lighter.So there is now way you can call this a good movie. It was a boring slow and monotonous action movie that does not deserve a rating above 4 stars. It's a shame that even todays critics call this a good movie.
"Wow. As a fan of the original Mad Max trilogy, this film nearly delivered on all fronts. The tone is dark, but the film never takes itself too seriously, and has an insane sense of self-awareness. Some of the concepts are so insane, outlandish, and stylish you can't help but laugh and enjoy the ride.The visuals are utterly unforgettable, creating some of the most memorable images that I have ever seen in a film. In addition to the beautiful desert landscape, like I previously mentioned, the film takes it's ideas and multiplies them to the nth degree. Some of the smaller scenes, that have barely any significance to the story, I remember because of the smallest visual detail that is presented in them, even if that scene in the long run, really holds no significance and is never mentioned again.Tom Hardy is great in the role of Max, keeping the mysteriousness and the likability of the protagonist in full force. What's fantastic about Max too is that, his past is never revealed in a exposition like scenario, rather it is told cleverly through visuals, a display that director George Miller respects the intelligence of the audience and doesn't want to spell everything out for them. Charlize Theron however, absolutely stole the show. Her acting is excellent- perfectly conveying her character and the emotions that are being dealt with. Some scenes she was in actually had me in near tears, her performance was so good. The exposition of her, unlike Max, is conveyed through dialog, but it doesn't feel forced. We don't get some long monologue from her about her past, rather it feels like a casual mention. It expertly tells us about her while keeping just the right amount of exposition left out, allowing us to connect the dots with other pieces of dialog or other visual details that reveal more about her. Simply put, she might be one of the best leading female protagonists put to the screen in a while.The characters are always given time to develop, even the smallest of characters. The film has the perfect blend of action and character driven moments, allowing the audience to take a breather every now and then and just soak in the characters of this world. I forgot to mention, the action is amazing. Because the film has the perfect plot that pretty much lends itself to action, it never stops moving, and gains so much kinetic energy you wonder if it'll ever stop. And sometimes, that can be a negative. Too much action at once can leave the viewer restless, but thankfully this doesn't become much of an issue until the end. It helps that in the action scenes, you can actually see whats going on, and the film doesn't over utilize shaky cam.I was really surprised by how much substance the narrative and the characters had, dealing much with themes of redemption and attempting to rid of a dark past. This is an action movie that isn't only a popcorn movie, this is likely something that you can analyze and find hidden meanings in. Because of this, people who are more into the artistic side of film (like myself) will enjoy it as well.This is the best film released all year and the best summer movie since the likes of Inception. Actually, in many aspects it might be better than Inception. It very well be the best action film so far this decade, and that is no exaggeration."
"WOW. My initial reaction. Absolutely incredible. This was a blast from the past and a brand new experience all at the same time, and I LOVED every second of it! From beginning to end this is a visceral and vicious film that any action film fan will enjoy. In a post-apocalyptic world where oil is the desire of Immortan Joe (evil comes to life from Hugh Keays-Byrne), but water holds the real power, Max (embodied perfectly by Tom Hardy) and Furiosa (exquisitely played by Charlize Theron) must team up to escape. Nux (a surprising performance by Nicholas Hoult) is a great addition to the team.If you enjoy action movies, this is right up your alley. This is the best action movie of the year, if not the decade. It could even be the best action movie of all time. It was fun, nuanced, and amazing. You think in seeing an action film, the character development won't be there, but George Miller brings you into the world perfectly and allows characters to say only the things, which are absolutely needed to tell the story. In an interview Tom Hardy was quoted saying that ""you can fit all my dialogue on one page."" Initially I scoffed at this statement, but after seeing the film I can't argue with it. It's a rare moment when it's funny because it's true. He has so few lines that his time on screen heavily depends on his actual acting ability and he doesn't disappoint.Not only is the acting on all accounts fantastic (Charlize Theron brings it home, once again), but the way this was filmed blows my mind. Every stunt was done in real time and was not CGI. This might not sound that impressive, but once you see the film, you will go insane trying to think of all the planning, money, and skill that went into every single shot, stunt, or intense moment of the film.Throughout the movie I was cheering, laughing, and clapping, probably to the dismay of others in the theater, but I was so invested and involved in the story that I didn't care. Many others were doing the same. It was that much fun. But more often than that, I found myself staring in awe of some of the incredible, beautifully composed shots during this action-packed adventure. The poster above is a part of the opening shot of the film and it pulls you into the world, both literally and figuratively.One last note, I think this has been the absolute best use of 3D that I've ever seen. Mad Max: Fury Road proves that 3D can still be exciting and add to a storyline as opposed to just being a flash in the pan (*cough-cough* Avatar) Never forget the importance of water in this world, or (Mad) Max Rockatansky will find you and make you regret your incompetence.If you like action films, GO SEE MAD MAX: FURY ROAD NOW!"
"This starts of very quickly with little ceremony and gets straight into the action; and this is an Action film with a capital 'A'. The expected Mad Max components are there; raiders, apocalyptic locations, cross bows etc; but the film is essentially one massive car chase.But I wouldn't let that put you off. The action is constant and relentless. The clever use of minimal CGI means everything looks fantastic.It stays true to the Mad Max theme with an element of cheesiness which is vital for this kind of movie to stay brutal but stop it getting too dark.There are strange contraptions, men on poles, mutated cliché characters preserved from the old world. The vehicles are wacky, interesting and varied. I personally loved what can only be described as the worlds most improbable morale boosting device? The only two gripes I have is the cgi for the flash backs is very poor along with the obligatory 3d scenes of steering wheels hurtling out the screen (they are even more annoying when you choose to watch in 2d). And the story is a little insulated. You are either in the big rig or chasing the big rig - I would have liked to see a dash more of the ruined world.But there is an awful lot to love about this. Some may find it a little simplistic, some a little too camp. But I think it would have been difficult to win all hearts and minds with this one."
"I will be quite simple with that, this is a rather simple movie after all. I'm not a fan of all of the superhero genre, people ask me why- and no it's not that I don't like it because it's a comic book at all, but it's just that the films tend to be just CGI filled, and lack any interesting atmosphere. I won't even talk about characters here.So, unlike those films, Mad Max: Fury Road does it all right, instead of CGI-filled action sequences we have ACTUAL stunts, this obviously, whether if consciously or unconsciously make the action look far better, also, unlike all those other modern action movies, we actually KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING, it's not just focusing on character each time and basically confusing us and not showing the entire battlefield so it may have the feel it is an actual fight- sequence, no, this film actually makes us know constantly what's on our back, sides and front.Of course I need to also address the unique post-apocalyptic atmosphere in this film, the music also fits rather perfectly. The ways those apocalyptic people fight with strange gadgets on top of their vehicles is also very entertaining to watch.So, I would definitely recommend this film, it is no Citizen Kane, I mean it isn't something deep- nor it should be, in fact I would say this is what a summer blockbuster should be- it may be not very philosophical or heart warming, but it is very entertaining and a lot of fun- and even memorable! Something we barely hear about in today's action films.So go watch it, recommended! 9/10."
"Who hasn't watched any of the Mad Max movies, he can be ashamed of himself, because those are one of the most lovable action pieces of all time. I've been waiting for this movie for a long time, and what motivated me even more for this movie is the lack of good quality action movies in these modern times.Movie starts in medias res. There we have Max, who is in the middle of a conflict between a gang and Furiosa, and there we have our plot for 2.5 thirds of this masterpiece. George Miller describes this post-apocalyptic world just as I have imagined it, everything is dry, there is lack of water, and carelessness of people for its nature got people to a conflict between themselves.Tom Hardy gives an alpha-male, bad-ass looking performance that reminded me of one in Lawless, where he didn't need a lot of words to speak but he was charismatic. Props to Hardy, but Furiousa steals the show for me. On many moments it seemed to me, but it actually is, that she was the main character of the movie. She is that character that we can relate to. She is that character that we feel for, and that is where Charlize Theron did a great job in.Picture of this whole movie is amazing. It is all executed very well, and to think that there is very little amount of green screen gives an enormous plus to the movie. Action doesn't stop, it is all paced, and just when you think that action stopped, it is just so audience can take a moment of rest just so it can take a adrenaline rush few seconds later.I have absolutely nothing else to add, I have enjoyed this film very much, and I hope that many directors will look up on George Millers style of shooting a movie, which is not just a fun way to take, but also very interesting and attractive. This movie excels in every way possible, it has interesting plot, lovable characters, and memorable action. It is a must-see modern masterpiece."
"Mad Max: Fury Road, the newest from George Miller was a film i never had much interest in. I haven't really seen the others in the franchise (i say haven't really because i have seen about half of the original) but to be honest it isn't really nesscessary. Im not sure if this is a prequel or sequel but whatever it is doesn't really matter as this is quite possibly the action film of the year and has some of the best action sequences of the decade in fact.If i were to explain plot here it would seem very thin because in terms of plot there isn't a huge deal of it, although this isn't really a bad thing. It follows Max as played by Tom Hardy who does do a great job following the footsteps of Mel Gibson, as well as rebel Furiosa played by Charlize Theron at the top of her game. The two go on a journey to i guess restore order to the post-apocalyptic world we are introduced to from the start of the film. Everybody in this film does a really good job, Tom Hardy's Australian accent wasn't the best i have heard but he doesn't say a great deal, most of the dialogue does come from Theron's Furiosa and she really adds a moral contrast to his performance and they play well of each other, in fact this as much her film as it is Hardy's which i was worried about being called ""Mad Max"" and all, but it doesn't bring the film down by a single notch.Now earlier on i mentioned that the film's plot isn't a very strong one. The reason this isn't a problem? Because the film is pretty much one huge action set piece. From the beginning to the very end the action does not stop. It is very much a road movie, but not a stereotypical road trip movie, it is a road movie where cars explode at every given moment and blood is splattered around with no remorse. I found out 80% of the films effects are practical and this does not surprise me at all because i had an extremely hard job pinpointing what is CGI and what isn't (with the exception of the prosthetic arm used by Theron's character). The real stand out for me was Nicolas Hult as Nux who is a character that you never know whether he is a villain or not. At first he seems insane, like our villain Immortal Joe (not the Toecutter), but you do get to know him and you do in fact feel for his character and even have sympathy for him and want him to succeed at points.By the end of the film, all the non stop action sequences that are thrown at us might seem too much, but they really aren't. Tom Hardy is as badass if not more than Mel Gibson (like i said though, i haven't seem all the Mad Max films) and Charlize Theron with the rest of the supporting cast do this film justice. You hear a lot about long overdue sequels spoiling what was once a great franchise but Fury Road just improves it. I hope that Jurrassic World and even Terminator Genysis can take a leaf out of this film's book. Mad Max:Fury Road deserves all the praise it is getting and is definitely one to get on blu-ray. See this film and you will have a Lovely Day as Nux would say. Plus, the flamethrower guitar dude was awesome, look out for him."
"I've seen the overstuffed toybox of my childhood pillaged for cinematic ""inspiration"" so many times now that the prospect rarely offends or entices me. Star Trek, Star Wars, every cruddy horror movie ever to have graced a rented VHS tape. Take it all, you greedy bastards. Melt my cherished memories down for pocket change, see if I care. After the heartbreaking artistic faceplant that was Ridley Scott's misbegotten Prometheus, I'd pretty much given up on these sorts of refried treats. O, me of little faith! If anyone can tool up a bloody-knuckle, road-raging death machine out of junked parts, it's George 'Mad Max' Miller. Fresh from the theater, I feel like an overstressed carburetor into which some baldhead lunatic just spat a mouthful of pure nitro. The pitiless desert sun is blazing nova bright above, and it's a lovely, lovely day indeed. I caught Fury Road in 3-D, which was cool...mostly because I now get to go back and see it without the unnecessary dimensional enhancement. And again gaze vacantly into that stupendous vortex of crazy-ass, nonstop, man-machine mayhem like the sweaty, crack-brained adolescent I once was (and of course always will be). I don't know that I've EVER in my screen-staring LIFE seen a vehicular action flick half so relentlessly thrilling. And certainly not this side of The Road Warrior. The bug-splattered, silver-glossed, ear-to-ear grin Miller & Co. smacked across my idiot mug in the film's opening moments is still fixed in place several hours later. Turns out mom was right: my face is stuck this way.One minor quibble: Fury Road would be improved significantly were some sensible soul simply to take a small red pen to each scripted instance of the words ""hope"" and ""redemption"". For a filmmaker whose visual storytelling has received such widespread praise, Miller sure lays on the thematic underlining with a hefty trowel. Some may accept Max and Furiosa's portentous small talk as appropriate to the tale's mythic ambitions. Me, I just found it kind of annoying, with the clunky sentimentalism tipping stoic gravitas into po-faced camp.But why fret over details? I mean, somebody who worked on this once- in-a-lifetime nightmare monsterpiece gets a screen credit for ""Wheels and Skulls"". How many other movies can you say that about?"
"Before I even talk about the plot, or the actors, I Would just like to say that this films visual effects/cinematography were incredible. No, not mind boggling cgi, just flat out great camera work and practical effects. The costume and make up designers need to sweep the awards this year for their work. I walked out of the film and only hours later did I realize how good they were. Reason being, because nothing was wrong with it. The camera work and effects were so smooth I couldn't appreciate how good they were because they actually complemented the plot instead of distracting the viewer from it. That being said, oh my goodness best looking movie of all time imo. 11/10 From the looks of it, only the new Star Wars film even comes close but we will see when the actual movie roles. Okay, that was just my review on the visuals of the film, lets talk aboot that plot eh? PLOT 8/10- It is what is, an action/post apocalyptic film can only have so good of a plot story before it gets too cluttered, this film does the best with what it has, a cool setting, cool characters, and really cool cars. The third part of the movie where they find Charlize's old biker clan is the weakest part of the plot, yet at the same time, it was necessary. That's the main strength of this plot, everything was necessary, no extra back story/flashbacks were handed to us, no unnecessary expostion, we were left to interpret based off of brief dialogue and voices in Max's head as to what has lead to these characters acting the way they did. This, should be the way every action movie models its plot after, nothing too deep, yet just enough to make us understand and care. Similar to the plot of taken in that we don't need information on how the villains came to be, or how our hero came to be so heroic, we are left to think, a wonderful tool in these types of films. ACTING 9/10- Acting wise I was surprised. With the exception of the ""breeders"", everyone was fit really well in their parts. Never have been a huge Hardy fan, but surprisingly roles where he talks less makes his performances better. Although he only has around 20 lines in the movie, the ones he mumbles out either made me laugh or made me realize he was disturbed. Charlize played a strong female lead who was kickass and is not over the top at the same time. With the exception of the part where she reunites with her old clan, all of her lines were necessary. The villains were awesome for the most part, my only complaint would be that we only really got to spend time with two of them, the third one, the fat one, was more of a side piece. None the less, great acting across the board.PACING 9/10- Start your engines, make sure you have enough gas to last for two hours because this one does not let up. From the opening scene of the movie till the canyon scene towards the end you will be thrown into an atmospheric fast paced film that is both exhilarating, and memorable. Although not every great action film is paced like this, it just works in this one, with every thing being so over the top, from the insane guitar creep, to the unbreakable bones of our hero, I don't know, it just freaking works. Visuals- 10/10GO SEE IT."
"I don't normally say that about a movie. Even my favorite films have flaws that I recognize and humbly admit to, even still that doesn't mean I love them any less. Mad Max: Fury Road is that rare example of a film that understands what it is so well that it forgoes flaws ...this is a perfect movie.Now I understand that's a bold statement, and I also know it's only my opinion, but it's something I thought long and hard about after walking out of the theater, still recovering from the 2 hour thrill ride I had just been on. There was not a single moment during Fury Road that I a) checked my watch b) thought something was out of place c) got bored with the actionThe characters, the music, the action, the direction - it's all top level stuff. No fluffy words in this review, I am simply stunned at Millers execution of this very simple plot. I love how Miller allows the expressions of the characters to speak for themselves, I love how he doesn't dwell on supposed important character moments because he understands exactly what to show and when to get back to the action. The music may the key ingredients in the mix as Junkie XL delivers a soundtrack full of thundering drums, epic violins and shredding electric guitar, a soundtrack that had my heart racing a million miles an hour and gazing at the screen in disbelief as cars and bodies flew through a sandstorm in slow motion.The fact that CGI was kept to a minimum makes the film feel even more satisfying, like we payed to see high octane action where cars crash into one another and people perform death defying stunts ...and we get what we pay for as close to 90% of what you're seeing is real.I could gush over this film for hours but I'd like to say that if nothing else, Mad Max: Fury Road gave me the feeling of being a kid again and seeing a blockbuster for the first time. In an age of bloated, CGI-filled summer movies, it's nice to see a simple, streamlined, real film in the mix. Welcome back Max, don't keep us waiting to long for the next one."
"Didn't rate this film at all. This was the only film I've ever walked out of in the cinema (and I wasn't the only person to walk out). Yes there is loads of action, but there is no storyline. These two factors combined makes the movie drag. I walked out after 90 minutes, which felt like 2.5 hours. It was basically one big action sequence. If you are not bothered about story lines and love pure action then you would probably like it, if not then I would steer clear. If you have to see it for yourself I would probably rent or download it, and save yourself the price of a cinema ticket. Such a shame as the trailer made it look so good, but if you were to watch the trailer for 2 hours, there's probably no difference from the actual movie."
"George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road. I don't even know where to begin. First of all, forget Avengers, forget Furious 7, this is THE movie to see this summer, and perhaps this decade. It is a nitrous injected, chrome plated masterpiece of savage beauty and reckless juggernaut aerobatics that has to be seen to be believed. Miller has taken the core elements of what made his Road Warrior so special and beloved, and kicked them into high gear for a revisionist take on the ages old post apocalyptic punk warrior desert chase film. Tom Hardy is hysterical as Max, a brooding, bruised hearted grump who just wants to be left alone, until he's dragged, literally into a deranged odyssey through the badlands. Charlize Theron is all rock solid tough as Imperator Furiosa, who hijacks the five breeding wives of tyrannical, terrifying warlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keayes Byrne, Toecutter from the first Max film) and flees into the desert to find a greener place away from the madness. Miller strips away any unnecessary dialogue or clichéd 'getting to know you scenes' and streamlines the film into one sleek, forward surging force of nature, with not a moment wasted, and not a line of dialogue or glare of the eyes that isn't somehow in service of the constant 'go, go, go' mantra of the story. Such pacing is the genius of what makes it such a thrill. Also amazing is the imagination and world building. Miller uses an anthropologists eye to look at what the human mind, and civilization would evolve to in a situation like this, resulting in every character having a realistic, thought through vernacular, and some truly phenomenal, lived in style set pieces that are truly eye popping. Such attention and care is rare in this genre. Miller and team have outdone themselves with this absolutely exhilarating film, technically proficient in every way and filled to the brim with the kind of love for films and telling stories that its predecessors revels in back then."
"The theatrical preview for Mad Max had my hopes sky-high. I was expecting avant garde, post-apocalyptic poetry on screen.The plot is thin, the dialogue severely uninteresting, and the special effects mostly a long, repetitive car chase through a desert. There could have been so much more story telling and character development but the film forces you to do the work of filling in those blanks with your own imagination.Nothing groundbreaking to see here. Mad Max is the kind of movie you watch ""because it was on"". The good parts are quite good but it still struggles with a b-grade script."
"The plot is apocalyptic clichéThe villain is unintentionally funny, childish and stupidFeminism propaganda is all over the film and Mad Max is not as important as FuriosaThe whole film is a ride through a desert and then they turn around and ride back and eventually win in the end (YAY HAPPY ENDING)It's intentionally fast forward and artificial to a degree that laws of physics don't matter anymoreIt's a great film for teen gamers who love shiny trailers but for me it's a waste of time and moneyAnd yes, we cannot trust RottenTomatoes or Metacritic anymore"
