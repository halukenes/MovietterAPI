"It sickened me in the past to see the Batman movie franchise slowly digging it's way to an early grave. After the quality Tim Burton films, the series pretty much went down the toilet, beginning a horrifically campy age of 'Bat credit-cards' and an armored Arnold Schwarzenegger tossing cringe-worthy puns at a Batman who seemed to be trying not to be embarrassed by the fact that his costume had nipples. So what could Warner Brothers producers hope to do to resurrect the franchise? Pretend it never happened, and start the whole series over again with a talented director, compelling story and capable cast. Enter Christopher Nolan, the mastermind behind 2000's 'Momento', widely praised as one of the most innovative films of the decade. As director/co- screenwriter, Nolan creates a richly dark, atmospheric world for Batman to inhabit, similar to that of the Burton films, but less cartoony. The film's screenplay, written by Nolan and David S. Goyer is quality stuff, it's true that some of the dialog exchanges can seem kind of contrived, particularly between Wayne and Liam Neeson's character, Ducard, but it sounds so classy you tend not to care. Nolan also puts a lot of trust in his audiences to stay put while the first hour of the film comprehensively explores Bruce Wayne's backstory, with no cape donning and few fight sequences. Nevertheless, the pace never slows, and the story is so unexpected and fascinating (who would have expected a Batman film to begin in a prison in Tibet? only Nolan could pull it off!) there's little chance of us losing interest. And this way, we really get a sense of who Bruce Wayne is, a trait none of the past movies were able to capture, including the Burton films. We see what drives him, what leads him to become this iconic crime fighter, and the reasoning behind the mask.Of course, to help the audience get under Bruce Wayne's skin, it doesn't hurt to have such a talented lead as Christian Bale. Bale has been emerging as one of the most talented actors of his generation, and he brings that talent to a peak here, playing the darkest of all superheroes. If you were to break down the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne, you would find that it is essentially three characters: Wayne as Batman, behind the mask; Wayne's public facade as the billionaire playboy; and the real, brooding Bruce Wayne. Bale plays all three of the characters to absolute perfection, and molds them together well enough to make it clear to show they are still the same person. He has been given tons of accolades for his performance already, and needless to say, he deserves every one.And the sheer quality of the supporting cast is mind-boggling, if for the number of big names only. It's very hard to find a weak spot in the incredibly strong array of performances here, but if one had to be found, it would have to be Katie Holmes. It's not that she gives a bad performance, on the contrary, but just she seems too young to be convincing as a district attorney. For me, Michael Gough will always be the definitive Alfred, but Michael Caine does an excellent job of taking over the role, giving a very strong (and often funny) performance. Liam Neeson is sheer class as Ducard, Wayne's mysterious mentor, as is Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, Wayne's arms manufacturer and provider of the Batman gear. It's wonderful to see the incredibly talented and much underrated Gary Oldman as Sgt. Gordon, the only decent cop in Gotham, and he truly makes the role his own. Even cult favorite Rutger Hauer makes an appearance as Richard Earle, the ambitious head of Wayne Enterprises. And (surprise surprise!) the villains are also actually menacing for once, as opposed to cartoony and corny. Cillian Murphy just about walks away with the show as the truly chilling Scarecrow (the sequences involving his 'fear gas' are surprisingly frightening) Ken Watanabe is mysterious and creepy as guild leader Ra's Al Ghul and Tom Wilkinson is very convincing as Carmine Falcone, head of the Gotham city mob. Nolan's knack for realism also comes as a breath of fresh air in this age of CGI bloated blockbusters - there are next to no computer generated shots in the movie, even a sequence with Batman standing on top of a high building staring down at the city was filmed with a stuntman. And it really works, the Batmobile actually interacts with it's environment, and looks so much better real than computer generated. But don't think that the film will come across as too serious and stuffy because of Nolan's realism - true, Gotham seems too dark and dirty to come across as a fantasy world, but Batman Begins retains that unmistakable sense of fun that seems to only be present in comic book movies. We jeer and fear the villains, and cheer the hero as he lays his life on the line to vanquish evil and save the city. And that is how it should be. There's even a surprising twist near the end, which is doubly surprising because it actually comes as a shock. What's not to love here?(and, further cudos to director Nolan for finally managing to make a swarm of bats actually frightening for once)Overall, I'd have to label Batman Begins 'The must see movie of the summer' - it's a well written, authoritatively directed, impeccably acted (especially by Bale's powerhouse lead performance and Cillian Murphy's sickly menacing Scarecrow) and very high quality production. Indeed, most other summer blockbusters could learn a thing or two from Batman Begins. If the Batman franchise died under it's own gaudiness years ago, let us rejoice this glorious rebirth - Batman truly does begin here.-10/10"
"Christopher Nolan (and cast) have pulled off what I hadn't dared to dream - a Batman every bit as good as Burton/Keaton's vision - and eradicated the camp, feverish memories of Clooney, Kilmer and (cough..) O'Donnell.The story is as good an origin story as you'll find - covering all the major (true-to-the-comic) events, and not wasting ages on them. We see Wayne's all-important training period (previously ignored), and his connection to the Tibetan shadow-ninja clan led by Ra's Al Ghul. We see Bruce come up with ideas for his symbol, his costume, his gadgets, his car, his cave - IT ALL FITS SO PERFECTLY.That's not all - Liam Neeson is perfect (as ever, when Lucas isn't writing his lines), Batman's first mad nemesis (the Scarecrow) is genuinely frightening; with some outstandingly scary 'fear' effects.. Gary Oldman looks just like a young Commissioner Gordon (and doesn't dominate), Morgan Freeman and Rutger Hauer give solid heavyweight support to the boardroom machinations at Wayne Enterprizes. I love Michael Gough(?) but Michael Caine is great as Alfred. It's only Katie Holmes who didn't ring true for me - not because of her performance, but simply because she looks all of 15 years old (sorry Katie). I am always blown away by Christian Bale, and this is no exception.The fights are great, the Bat-gadgets all there, the car is amazing, the plot is thorough and exciting, Gotham looks great, Batman really is frightening & menacing (and lethal!).. And the scenes with the bats themselves FINALLY get across the idea of how scary they can be.There is some humour, but it's fairly dry. The soundtrack, like all the best original soundtracks, is excellent - you hardly know it's there, but the emotions of the scene are enhanced and boosted. For the most part this is a serious Batman film, with plenty for long-time fans. This NEW Batman is one I'd like to see again. Bravo Mr Nolan, bravo."
"I had fearful reservations about this one. I loved Tim Burton's Batman - 12 years old when it came out I was the perfect age for it and I also enjoyed Batman Returns. The franchise went so wrong under Joel Schumacher that I wasn't sure I wanted it resurrected. Not least because Batman was one of the few comics I read and enjoyed as a kid and was always my favourite superhero. I grew up reading the comics, watching reruns of the Adam West TV show and then getting Burton's celluloid vision. I was spoilt for choice as a kid but as an adult now I was concerned revisiting the franchise, especially given Warner's record over the last decade of screwing up summer blockbusters with potential all over the place (dare I bring up the Matrix sequels?)However, I am pleased to report I could not have been more wrong about how great Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins is. This is better than Burton. Sacrilege, you say?! Well Burton was still cartoony in many elements, he wasn't churning out the bilge of Schumacher but Burton's Batman was still over the top. As a kid this was ideal but Nolan's Batman is real. Everything in this world seems plausible and it is therefore a world that draws you in. Characters' vulnerability is that much more present. Every bruise, every scare, every concern, every emotion seems real.Part of this is that Nolan has assembled an exemplary cast. Again, this concerned me prior to seeing the film. I wasn't sure a cast of big name legends like Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman and well known names like Liam Neeson and Katie Holmes wouldn't detract and distract from Batman. I was always sure Christian Bale could be the great moody Batman he's been waiting his career to be but the others I wasn't so sure about.That said Bale is not just good, he's superb. I never thought I'd really be able to envision anyone other than Michael Keaton as the definitive Batman for me but since seeing Batman Begins a couple of days ago Bale has cemented himself in the position. Perhaps Keaton will now be able to escape the spectre of Batman he hasn't truly shaken off for 13 years.The rest of the cast is also pitch perfect. Cillian Murphy is creepy as hell, Liam Neeson is authoritative and imposing, Katie Holmes is strong and sexy (I particularly thought she'd be insipid, she should jettison Tom Cruise and let her talent - which she does have naysayers just watch Pieces Of April - speak for itself) and Michael Caine is an Alfred you've never seen but in fact far more likely as a butler than the aristocratic pomp with which he is usually portrayed. Gary Oldman is also superb in a rare wholly decent character for him as Lieutenant Jim Gordon who gets far more to so here than Gordon has ever had to do before. Only Tom Wilkinson is a little off with a slightly comedic wise-guy American accent that never really convinces.The emotional bond between Bruce Wayne and Alfred is actually a wonderful human heart to the film than Nolan and Goyer have written perfectly.Don't let that make you think the action is not front and centre though. From Wayne's training through the early stages of the film to his early missions as Batman at about the half way point to a thrillingly choreographed chase sequence and an edge of your seat finale this film delivers the cool quotient in bucket loads.Great villains (especially Murphy), great story, great cast, great action... put simply, great film. Probably the best comic-book movie ever made (that's excluding the genius Sin City which I consider a moving comic-book rather than a comic-book movie, that will never be bettered but Batman is a different beast and the best of its kind)."
"Finally, after the previous 2 outings of the caped crusader, the Batman franchise is back on track. Having been a big comic collector over the years and a long time fan of the Dark Knight, I was especially disappointed by 'Forever' and 'Batman and Robin'. To me, these film lost the essence of what drives Bruce Wayne to do what he does and turned Batman into more of a pop star than misunderstood hero.Thankfully though, Nolan has gone back to the roots of the character, portraying a confused and angry Bruce Wayne, who ultimately rises to become Gotham's greatest champion. Don't expect to see loads of shots of Batman in this film though. It is the story of Wayne and focuses mainly on his years of training and preparation for becoming Batman. You are almost teased throughout the first half of the movie, waiting to see the excellent Christian Bale in the costume, as it keeps holding back to keep you in anticipation. When Batman does finally turn up on screen, it is well worth the wait. In my opinion, Bale was born for this role and for the first time when watching a Batman film, I enjoyed the scenes of Wayne being Wayne as much as Wayne being Batman.One of the strongest features of the film, is the way that it manges to suck you in believe that a 'Batman' could be a reality one day. The technology is current, with no use of silly OTT weapons and gadgets, again making the film work by today's standards. Plus, we are not allowed to forget that Batman is still just a man under the costume and there are times when he gets a bit of a kicking and shows that he can be vulnerable too, something we sometimes forget when watching a superhero flick. Gone too, are the silly villains!!! Jack Nicholson was the perfect Joker but from there it went downhill. Thankfully, in this movie the bad guys are actually fairly 'normal' and manage to be menacing at the same time.Which finally brings me to the cast. I always had high expectations for this film when the cast was announced. Let's face it, what a line up! Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Liam Neeson, Katy Holmes, Ken Watanabe and Tom Wilkinson are not to be sniffed at. Even an old favourite of mine makes an appearance: Rutger Hauer! Awesome. Actors of this calibre would never have gotten involved in this project if they didn't have faith in Christoper Nolan's talents and thankfully they took the leap...For the comic book fans out there, waiting to see this movie, let me assure you that you won't be upset. Imagine the darkness of the 'A Death In The Family' and the 'Year One' story lines. I have never met a fan of Batman who didn't love these books. Well, this is the kind of Batman you can expect from Bale: Dark, brooding and tortured by his past, yet the hero we have come to love. For those of you who are not comic fans, then just look forward to seeing how Batman should be. This film is a credit to Bob Kane's original vision and a testament to all the talented artists and writers who keep the legend of the Dark Knight alive in the comic books today....Thank you Mr. Nolan and thank you Mr. Bale. In fact thanks to everyone who worked on this film. Batman finally Begins from here...."
"To tell the truth, I thought the Batman franchise could never be saved, and I was really let down that I may never see my favorite superhero in a good movie ever again. Then I saw the preview to Batman Begins, I didn't really know what to think. New Batman. New Alfred. New story. New style. I wasn't sure why I wanted it 'the old way', but maybe I wanted to the actors in the Batman films I grew up with, to revive themselves and make a good Batman movie. I wanted Robin and sadly, Batgirl, alongside Batman saving the world from another familiar villain.I heard Batman Begins, and I thought great, this was called ""Batman"" in 1989, selfishly I said, ""I want something new!"".But, of course being a big Batman fan, I went opening night to Begings. 2 and half hours later, like the rest of the audience was completely blown away. It was the only movie I had ever been to (and yes I have been to some great ones) where the crowd claps and the end. This was not just golf claps for a popcorn clip, this was a standing ovation for 10:30 pm show in a crowded theater in Austin, Texas.I never would have thought this would have worked, even with Nolan directing. But I was wrong, so wrong. After seeing the X-Mens and Spidermans, I clearly thought Marvel had the upperhand and DC was just simply trying to keep up, again, so wrong.Nolan gave us a dark, gritty, and pleasantly realistic, view of Batman. Bale gives a tremendous performance as both Batman and Bruce Wayne. Michael Caine was a fabulous Alfred, and Morgan Freeman almost stole the show as Luscious Fox.Even though X-Men and Spiderman(all of them) are wonderful superhero movies, Batman Begins, is just a good, no, great movie. And I think that is what blew people away, that it wasn't just some superhero, special effect, hero gets girl, good guy wins movie, it was a truly dark and well crafted movie, and it maybe stupid to say, but it didn't even feel like you were watching a superhero movie.I don't even think Burton, and his animated style(which works), could have revived this troubled series, that Schumaker wrecked, because like Fantastic Four and Daredevil, tried over do it and give us the latter part of things.So, here is to you Chris Nolan. You saved a franchise. You made an unforgettable movie, that will be remembered as the best superhero movie of all time, but just an all around great and unforgettable movie classic."
"Batman Begins is a satisfying and mature take on the genre that more often than not gets treated with quantity over quality in mind simply showing that comic-book adaptations are feasible movies for all ages.Batman Begins is monumental not only for the superhero genre but for the film industry as a whole and that because of Christopher Nolan, who (finally out of all the directors) got it right. Unlike Michael Keaton films, Batman Begins made me care about Bruce Wayne. The whole first hour of the film is about Bruce Wayne, not Batman which puts lots of trust on the audience on Nolan's behalf. Christian Bale as Bruce does a noteworthy job despite sounding like he's battling with throat cancer as Batman, nevertheless an exceptional job. It's hard to find a problem with the performances but there is one; Katie Holmes. I wouldn't consider her performance distractingly bad but she seemed too poorly prepared and too unconvincing to play Rachel.Hanz Zimmer and James Newton Howard compose some of their best soundtracks, most of the time it's very subtle and other times it utilizes with characters emotions flawlessly. Wally Pfister does an extraordinary job with the cinematography and mixed with amazing fight choreography it's beautiful.As much as I love Batman, I love quality film making which Batman Begins is accept for one big plot hole. Near the end of the film Batman grapple hooks onto a moving that so that he can stop Ra's, but just before that Batman send Gordon to destroy the monorail supports so the train wouldn't reach Wayne Tower and crash. If he knew that why did Batman get on the train?On the contrary Batman Begins, aside from dry humour and the mentioned plot holes, is a must-see for the superhero genre. Thank you, Christopher Nolan.Final Rating: 8/10"
"I got a chance to see 'Batman Begins' just this past Friday evening. I must say that before seeing the film, I felt in my heart this is the 'Batman' film we've been waiting for. Within ten minutes into the movie, I turned to my date and said to her, ""This is it! This is the movie!"" I just can't believe that after all these years, Warner Bros. finally got it right. For me the most intriguing part of the film, apart from the great script, and great acting, was Christopher Nolan's decision to base the film in reality. Deciding that Batman could really exist in our universe and our world was a stroke of genius. Another aspect of the film that's so refreshing is that instead of the focus being on the villain, Batman is the film's star. And rightly so. It's amazing what can happen when a studio leaves a respected director, and the creative team alone, and allow them to make the best movie possible. The only two negatives that I can think of is Katie Holmes and the fight sequences. Holmes does indeed look like a teenager playing grown-up. Her performance isn't bad per SE, it's just that you really don't buy her as an Assistant D.A. As for the fight sequences, I felt the cameras angles were too tight on the action, edited too quickly, and lit too dark so that you really couldn't tell what was going on and determine who was hitting who. Maybe we can attribute this to the fact that Nolan is not an action director. Hopefully the next film will open up the fight sequences so we can actually see Batman use the martial arts skills he developed during his exile. But apart from those relatively minor quibbles, the film is excellent, and I'm definitely going back on opening day June 15th, and seeing it a second time. A third and fourth viewing is definitely not out of the question."
"To start off this review I'd like to go back to the original batman series. Adam West hammed it up in what has to be the campest yet enjoyable version of batman. It was cheesy, it had the POW, WHACK, KABOOM, very very tongue-in-cheek which, brings me to my next point, is what batman eventually became. Batman, featuring Michael Keaton was a good film, keaton was a good batman, he portrayed the dark knight to a whole new army of fans, a darker batman, less camp, plus with a villain such as Jack Nicholson (turning in another great performance) as the Joker it was win win. Where from there? A sequel, Keaton yet again, Batman Returns, not as good as its predecessor but still a thoroughly enjoyable film with the villains being Penguin (Devito) and Catwoman (Pfeiffer) adding something different to the batman series. All is going well, then things start to go sour. Keaton is gone and in comes Kilmer who has to be the most wooden Batman ever, in come the clichés, the tongue in cheek one-liners and so on but Batman still has some credibility until, dare I mention it, Batman & Robin. This ruined the Batman series with Clooney just being the eye-candy for the ladies, the addition of Batgirl (oh dear Lord) and the villains just coming out with the most tongue-in-cheek one liners ever, example Mr Freeze ""You're not sending me to the cooler"", wrong, oh so wrong. Something had to be done and this was Batman Begins. This film rescues the Batman series single-handedly, it's a shame it didn't start off this way as it might not of died on it's rear. Bale is an inspired choice as Batman bringing a more serious side to Batman, the story is well paced, it's not all talk or just mind-numbing action, it actually keeps you gripped as you want to find more about Bruce Wayne's past. The only reason it misses out on a 10 is the quite pitiful bad guy scarecrow If you've not seen it I don't want to give too much away about the story but throw away all your perceptions about Batman because Batman is back and Batman has truly begun. D-man."
"Batman Begins was a massive breath of fresh air when it came out in 2005. Coming 8 years after Warner Brothers jumped the bat, as it were, with Joel Schumacher's childish mess, ""Batman and Robin"", Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins brought a maturity and seriousness to The Caped Crusader that had been absent since Tim Burton left the world of Gotham. While Batman Begins might not boast the visual prowess or rich villains of Burton's two Batman movies, it fleshed out the character of Bruce Wayne in a way no movie has since.Batman Begins is an origin story straight through, detailing Bruce Wayne's (Christian Bale) emergence from tragically scarred child to a symbol of heroism and darkness. After training with Ra's al Ghul and the League of Shadows, Bruce Wayne returns to Gotham in perfect mental and physical shape. What Nolan and screenwriter David Goyer do perfectly here, is inject Bruce Wayne with an emotion never before seen in a Batman movie. You can feel the pain and grief Wayne is experiencing and you can see why he decides to become a living symbol of good. The first full origin story for Batman on film, Batman Begins is very much told from Bruce's point of view. Earlier Batman movies often focused more heavily on developing the villains, leaving Bruce Wayne in the shadows. The approach that keeps Batman a dark, mysterious figure is a valiant one, and it makes sense. However, context rarely hurts, and Batman Begins provides the character with heaps of context. You can clearly understand the emotions and motivations of the man behind the mask. The origin is also utterly believable. You can see why Bruce Wayne dresses like a bat, why he needs a cape, how he gets a super-car and super-gadgets, and why he hides in a cave. Does it strip Batman of his mythic status? Yes, a bit. Luckily, unlike Nolan's two follow-ups, Begins doesn't get too carried away with realism, retaining a comic book style that its successor would forget.While it does take a while for Bruce Wayne to fully become the bat, it is worth it. Once Bruce Wayne finally dons the cape and cowl, there are a few jaw-dropping action scenes including a brilliant batmobile chase scene and a thrilling climax on Gotham's elevated trains. The atmosphere and feeling of Gotham City is nearly perfect in it's own way. It does not have the Gothic beauty of Tim Burton's Batman universe, but it's blend of comic book dinginess and contemporary sleekness makes Gotham a terrifically realized cityscape. The city feels like what a comic book world would be like if it actually existed. Batman himself is a dark, brooding, wonderfully realized character in his own right and he shares the screen with an ensemble of great actors. Michael Caine as Alfred, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, and Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon are standouts in an ensemble cast that is playing the comic book material straight as an arrow. Cillian Murphy as the Scarecrow is an excellent but criminally underused baddie, but on the whole, the supporting cast elevates the material.Batman Begins is still as fresh today as it was more than a decade ago. The origin of Batman is engaging, engrossing, and emotional. The story provides a context to the Bruce Wayne character that elevates the movie beyond its fun comic book plot. The origin is a satisfying and believable one, and once Batman finally enters the scene, the action is unmatched. Batman Begins is a strong, confident summer superhero blockbuster with more maturity and emotional truth than most dramas. I hesitate to call it the definitive interpretation of Batman (Batman 1989 takes that title), but Batman Begins is the best of Christopher Nolan's Batman movies, a film that balances gritty realism, human drama, and thrilling comic book fun.85/100"
"Batman Begins is a well told story of the origin of Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale). It covers a lot of the same ground as Michael Keaton's original Batman, but goes much further in depth in many factors of his creation. It goes into great detail about subjects such as how he got his costume, what exactly it is. Same goes with the Batmobile. We also find out why he chose to be bat-like.One of the more interesting aspects here is how it shows Bruce's father, Thomas Wayne (Linus Roache), and how he molded Bruce's life and instilled good judgment within him, a point which is misunderstood about him by most people he comes in contact with. Thomas, too, teaches Bruce valuable lesson, such as ""We fall so we can learn to pick ourselves up"". This is pretty close to the theme of the movie or motto Bruce Wayne lives by. The resemblance of the father & son is pretty good, too.I also thoroughly enjoyed the training Bruce Wayne endured becoming ""invincible"". Bruce is trained by Ducard (Liam Neeson) in many ways like a ninja (The concept of Batman IS similar to a ninja). He is taught many valuable lessons in this temple and is shown no mercy. Eventually, we even see his first real enemy as a superhero/vigilante.Although I am not positive as to how true to the comic book this movie is, I am sure it took a few liberties, as did Spider-Man. Most of the small examples I have noticed are for the better and make for a good story. The Batmobile is more believable as an expensive armored vehicle that the military would not spend the money on than a juiced up Corvette (or whatever that was). Same with the Batsuit.Katie Holmes is excellent as Rachel Dawes, a D.A. who is not afraid to go after the big villains in court. Also worthy of mentioning is Michael Caine as Alfred the butler. I do not believe they could have found a better man for that role, although I could not get the image of Caine as Austin Powers' dad out of my head when he was on screen.Finally, in my opinion, Christian Bale makes a much better Batman than the three recent previous ones in Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer and George Clooney. Something about him makes Batman darker and more mysterious. Hopefully, DC Comics and movies have learned from their mistakes and we will not have to worry about Batman picking up a sidekick in this newest installment of the Batman series. 9/10"
"This film easily trumps any live-action incarnation we've scene of the Dark Knight before, borrowing heavily from both the comics and the Dini and Co. animated series. This is a hard, fast, driving, heartfelt epic that draws you into the character of Bruce Wayne and makes you damn well care. Batman doesn't play second-fiddle to the villains here like in the other films. It's his movie and that's the way it should be.Much has been said of the film's ""reality"" quotient, and I'm here to say it works. Nolan talks about how Batman's strong because he does push-ups, he gets around because of his gadgets, and by introducing each of them with a plausible explanation, we forget to quibble and go along with it. The technology may be fantastic, but it's believable. And, unlike the ""reality"" of something like Daredevil, Nolan doesn't forget his ideals halfway though and start having Batman wire-jump thirty feet into the air."
"I've just come back from a preview screening of Batman Begins. I went in with low expectations, despite the excellence of Christopher Nolan's previous efforts. Talk about having your expectations confounded! This film grips like wet rope from the start. I won't give away any of the story; suffice to say it mixes and matches its sources freely, tossing in a dash of Frank Miller, a bit of Alan Moore and a pinch of Bob Kane to great effect. What's impressive is that despite the weight of the franchise, Nolan has managed to work so many of his trademarks into a mainstream movie. The story does not progress in linear fashion for the first half, and there are some truly spectacular hallucination scenes. Parents thinking of taking their young kids along, think twice. When we left, a terrified 8-year-old boy was being comforted by his parents. Some of what's up there on screen really is the stuff of nightmares.Of the cast of Brits chosen to bring this American tale to the masses, Christian Bale convinces in his dual role, while Michael Caine as Alfred comes up with the humour just when the film is in danger of taking itself too seriously. Gary Oldman and Tom Wilkinson provide able support, as does Morgan Freeman. Most refreshing of all is the way that Nolan and co have come up with a way of bringing comics to the screen that does justice to the often adult source material in a way that, say, Daredevil, tried and failed to do (although the director's cut is better). If the Dark Knight doesn't return after this, there's no justice."
"BATMAN BEGINS lives up to what I heard about it being a ""darker"" version, with much less reliance on flippant one-liners or gags, the result being a more realistic feel for what might have been.From the very start, there is a nice chemistry between Alfred, the butler (superbly played by Michael Caine) and Bruce Wayne (excellent job by Christian Bale). The humor is of the gentle kind, almost subtle in its implications, and it sets the stage for the more realistic flow of events to follow. There's a pulsating background score by Hans Zimmer and John Newton Howard that races along with the film, punctuating it in just the right places, at just the right moments, to give a vigorous punch to the action scenes. And there are plenty of them.But the quieter moments are all extremely well played and given depth by real characterizations--not just cartoonish figures. There is depth in all of the performances with the possible exception of Katie Holmes, an actress who speaks in a voice barely above a whisper and fails to project the belief that she is an assistant district attorney. Miss Holmes needs lessons in projecting her voice.Looming over the landscape is Liam Neeson, a distinguished actor who excels in his carefully concealed villainy. He is a force to be reckoned with and displays all of his versatility here. Equally effective in lesser roles are Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer as the Board Chairman that Bruce Wayne ultimately replaces, and Gary Oldman.The story is forcefully presented with magnificent visuals and eye-popping sets that all have a realistic gleam and are yet stylized enough to give credence to the fact that this is all based on a comic strip character.I can't praise Christian Bale enough as the man who dons that mask. He has all the strength and wily intelligence behind his serious good looks and makes the perfect embodiment of the action hero he is portraying. Firm of jaw, direct of gaze, he makes an excellent hero.Praise too for Cillian Murphy, who makes the most of his Scarecrow role behind a mask of creepy blandness, underplaying his role (as most of the others do) so as not to become a caricature, as so often happens in these Batman enterprises. If it's a series of running gags that you expect--as from previous Batmans--you won't find them here. The thrills come one after another, set pieces that are astounding to watch.Well worth the wait. Christopher Nolan has done an excellent job of handling his subject matter with great skill and flourish. Warning note: Perhaps a little too intense for children, but adults are certainly going to appreciate the fact that the real Batman has arrived."
"I just came back from a special screening of Batman Begins and I must say this is the best movie I have yet seen this year. All of the blockbuster movies I had seen this year with much expectation have been disappointing. But Batman Begins is not the typical corny action film; it incorporates all aspects of genre: action, fantasy, drama, and even comedy. I was at the edge of my seat from the thrills in some scenes and clapping & laughing from the humorous lines that director Christopher Nolan had written for the characters. I was really amazed by the acting performances from the new generation of actors, assuming that they wouldn't have been able to compete with and compliment the talented, veteran actors such as Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, and Liam Neeson. I mean you couldn't have asked for better actors!! Christian Bale was just perfect for the role: he had the intensity, physique, and charm you'd expect a Batman character to encompass. Every actor was casted perfectly for their roles. I even give props to Katie Holmes for playing a district attorney considering her previous roles consisted of ""the young girl"" or ""girlfriend"". I hardly ever see action films nowadays because I don't want to waste my time watching a conventional, corny, over-digitalized,plot less film. To be honest, I gave this film a chance not because it was a Batman movie, but rather because of the talented veteran actors as well as being a fan of Christopher Nolan's previous films. Whether you're a fan of Christopher Nolan or just a Batman fanatic, you'll enjoy every single second of the movie. People of ALL ages will appreciate this film. The violence in this movie is not vulgar, but rather sends out a lot of great messages of loyalty, respect, and humility. Not only is ""Batman Begins"" the best of the Batman series, it is the most unconventional. This recommendation is coming from a person who mostly watches art-house/independent films."
"Eight years after the infamous abomination Batman & Robin that killed the Batman franchise, Christopher Nolan stepped in and started a whole new series a darker (even darker than the first two Tim Burton Batman movies) and realistic level. Now at first, I wasn't mad on Batman Begins because at first I thought it was boring and it took a while to get to the part where Bruce Wayne becomes Batman. But after a while, I loved the film. In fact, it turned out to be my favourite Batman movie even though I really like the first two Batman movies by Tim Burton. I really like how we get to see the origins of Batman like the tragic death of his parents and becoming a martial arts expert in somewhere in Asia. Also I think it's clever how they made Batman act like a ninja than a superhero. Christian Bale is really good and intimidating as Batman but I think he's not as good as Michael Keaton's Batman. But also I think the rest of the cast did very well like Katie Holmes, Liam Neeson, Michael Caine and Cillian Murphy. But I can't understand why Katie Holmes was nominated for a Razzie for Worst Supporting Actress. I liked her as Rachel and she was a lot better than Maggie Gyllenhaal; not to mention better-looking. It's too bad The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises weren't as great as Batman Begins. I mean I think The Dark Knight is really overrated. I mean most people seem to be overglorifying it just because of Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker and his death. But The Dark Knight Rises was brilliant and gave a nice ending to the trilogy but I don't think it wasn't as fresh as Batman Begins. By the way, happy birthday to the creator of Batman, the late Bob Kane!"
"With all obvious accounting, the Batman Magic' is back! Not since Michael Keaton, when the first modern and great, big screen Batman appeared in 1989, has there been such a commotion made about a new Batman movie. I had not seen this in the movie theater, but as with the first I started seeing bumper stickers and baseball caps and posters of the Batman Begins logos and the like, that's what let me know this was different, than the others. The first Keaton one, I saw it right-off-the-bat! No waiting, with this there had been so many in between, that seemed to be slipping more and more with every new installment, that I simply 'balked' at the thought of Batman 'Again'.Well after I had caught my breath I was astounded at the beauty of the first scenes and how this film instantly whisked me into the whole story. Amazed, as I watched 'Bale' brought on the 'Knight' with a new era of and a fresh-feeling crisp new character/hero. Liam Neeson, enters from out of nowhere and he is a thing of beauty. A solid-cast mentor/trainer in the fine art of crime fighting. Neeson is a pillar in the 'Begin' set. As the grueling training comes to a successful end, there comes the time to re-enter his broken life, complete with his estate and butler. Michael Caine is delightful as the classy care servant 'Alfred'. There was some real genius, to place Caine in this position, he fits to a 'T'. Rutger Hauer, is an acting hero of mine from way back and this was just an unexpected treat of a performance that he had in the story. Gary Oldman, is versatile, Tom Cruise wishes he was as good as Old' Gary. Oldman is inspirational with every labored breath that he took. I was amused too, at one point as the Batman made a surprise appearance at Gordon's (Oldman) home, on the steps Batman informs him of the situation and as he answers Oldman is doing a perfect 'Christopher Walken' styled delivery, just in those few sentences. That gave even a wider performance overall. In the hotel, I laughed as Bruce Wayne having friendly dinner conversation with colleagues from his company when asked about the news of the Batman, says ""A man dressed as a bat clearly has some issues to take care of."" Schluffing it off, as just another crazy man in the dark city. Pure gold.I must say, that Katie Holmes seemed a little too young for me in the beginning, albeit she came through toward the end with a satisfying role. Tom Wilkinson, playing the big crime boss, was reminiscent of the days of Nicholson (the Joker) with the late great Jack Palance,(Boss Grissom) but surely didn't reach the criminal element that these two gave off in stellar performance's in Burton's 89' Batman. At one point in the prison holding room, Wilkinson seemed to be acting much like Dan Hedaya, as he was speaking to counsel as the crime lord.Morgan Freeman is wondrously refreshing, and apart from other roles he has played, I enjoyed Lucius Fox for everything that he (Freeman) gave it, simple, easy and likable. The other players all found excellent fitting surrounding our main names. There was a lot put into this one no denying it, I was overtaken by the classic yet new styling of the camera shots and the places that the story took us to, and last but not least that Bat-Vehicle is something that every Hummer 'wishes' it could dream, wake-up and become. The Bat-S.U.V. for all your needs.Thoroughly penetrating in delivery, this has a strength and smoothness in it's style, it is a solid tailor-crafted action/drama ...a sure fire hit. (*****)"
"........ ..............................................from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FL Warner Brothers gave us a very special gift for Father's Day, 2005... BATMAN BEGINS. Despite displaying some lethargy in its opening scenes, and suffering from some of the excesses so common in this genre of film, not only might you say it is the best of the Batman Franchise, so far, but also that it is definitely the best super-hero film ever!Director, Christopher Nolan, who dazzled with his amazing talent in the 2000 Cult Classic, MEMENTO, has assembled a formidable cast (Michael Caine, Liam Neesom, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson & Morgan Freeman, among others), an outstanding script and special effects all well focused in a film that transforms a two dimensional comic strip into a work of real depth! In the title role, we have Christian Bale, British, 31 at the time the film was made, someone who has spent most of his life in front of the cameras, without reaching, at least at this juncture in time, the long-awaited status of ""Super-Star"". In 2000, Bale took on another title role in American Psycho, a 'Cult Classic' which received ample attention from both critics and audiences alike. (If you have not seen this psychological thriller, do soWhat a gem it is! Bale is chillingly creepy!) On the one hand, Mr. Bale is one of very few British actors (Well, Welsh, to be exact) capable of playing an American where his accent, intonation, and even body language, is absolutely perfect, impeccable! (After taking in American Psycho, I could have sworn he was American!) However, in BEGINS, although his performance seemed quite good, it was slightly below my expectation. I attribute this to two factors. First, as I'm sure Bale was already awareaudiences went in with tremendously high expectations regarding his role. And secondly, with a supporting cast of the caliber involved in this film, it would have been almost impossible to stand out in the same way he did in American Psycho. .For my taste, the only really weak link was the now famous for being Tom Cruise's-EX, Katie Holmes! Before appearing in BEGINS, Ms. Holmes never had a real stand-out role, at least in my opinion, nor really had been in many high profile films. To all fairness to her, though, it wasn't so much that her characterization was extremely lacking as much as that her performance just wasn't up to those of others in this brilliant cast! .To highlight the very best that Batman Begins shows us, unlike almost all movies in this genre, its characters are anything BUT black and white. Just as in real life, almost all of them evolve in a kind of constant metamorphosis, responding and interacting with lady luck, day to day life events, and reactions from those around them! And they do it most convincingly, not the least bit far-fetched. .Before rushing out to see it, just a little warning. For those who yearn for Action-packed blockbusters, Begins might leave you feeling somewhat unfulfilled! And for those who crave really intense human drama, since, at the end of the day, this is still a comic book ""super-hero"", not some conflicted politician, or not even anything closeLet's try to keep things in perspective, O.K.? In conclusion, if you have EVER seen any film based on a comic strip that you have liked in the past, then don't hesitate to see Batman Begins...I guarantee you'll be rating it at least 7 STARS! 10 SuperHero Stars...ENJOY/DISFRUTELA! Any comments, questions or observations, in English or Español, are most welcome!.....KissEnglishPasto@Yahoo.com"
"I thought this movie was absolutely spectacular, I took me by surprise. I never thought I would see a Batman movie with depth and that showed the true fear that is the character Batman that he brings to his enemies. Christian Bale did a excellent job and I truly look forward to him in another Batman Movie! The story was absolutely amazing and in my humble opinion very original. Raj Al Ghul is an excellent villain and to portray him in the way he was portrayed was top notch, not to mention he was played very well. Many people I talked to complained that the actor who played him was not of Asian decent. However I believe it truly didn't matter at all.Not to mention Alfred was great. Gordon (later Commissioner Gordon) was excellent as well.No other Batman Movie has portrayed Batman truly as the Dark Knight and as I said already I truly look forward to more along these lines.-ND"
"What a movie,they who have made this movie has got an excellent idea about ""The dark"" man. The other batman movies i did not like,but this is the best ""cartoon movie"" ever!So if you did not like the other movies like me,i highly recommend this film,can't wait to the next film comes to the store!'The plot is genial,i can't understand how the other crappy movies has been made,and P.Bateman is The Batman him self,wounder about who is playing Robin in the next movie.At the end i will also say that this movie are not for kids,scared the hell out of me,and i am a more Saw 1,2 and 3 lover!"
"I've seen all of Batman movies and they were OK at best and sometimes awful .. I nearly lost hope of this series but when I heard that Nolan is directing the next Batman .. I braced myself to a very good movie at least and Nolan hasn't let me down .. it is the only Batman movie that you could call a masterpiece even people who liked it less consider it a very good movie and the best batman (so far). This movie is loaded with class A starts (like other batman movies) but they are the best of the best .. Liam Neeson & Michael Caine were very good .. Morgan Freeman wasn't at his best but he was OK at least .. Christian Bale is a unique actor and I think he will show us great performance in other movies to come in the future .. he is the type of actor he will try everything and anything that makes his performance good .. keep in mind his awesome performance in ""The Machinist"" .. he has a great facial expresses that he uses very good .. Gary Oldman wasn't very good but wasn't bad either .. Cillian Murphy also was very good .. even Katie Holmes was good. The visual effects were convening and were so realistic that sometimes I feel that they didn't use much of computer effects. What can I say about this masterpiece !! in short, Christopher Nolan worked hardly on this movie and he surely has lifted it up to the masterpiece level .. everything sounds prefect in this movie. Do not miss it .. it is one of the best in 2005 and absolutely the best batman movie (so far) .. I hope Nolan is directing the next batman so I enjoy it as much as I enjoyed Batman Begins."
"Christian Bale is superb in this film, directed by Christopher Nolan. This is the best heroic movie ever produced, and it sets the stage to become the most phenomenal production the world will ever see.Additionally, Christian Bale is the best Bruce Wayne, and Batman I have ever seen on film. Although Michael Keaton was good, Bale exceeds his performance, and excels in this film with epic features and excellency in all aspects of heroism.I highly recommend this film to all, as it may be the best movie ever produced, in my opinion. Furthermore, Michael Caine is a wonderful supporting actor, and he makes ""Alfred"" impossibly believable during the film. He provides character to the Wayne family. Lastly, Katie Holmes makes a great appearance in this film, and has a strong character who tries to fight the impossible growing criminal society of Gotham City."
"All i can say is thank you Chris Nolan,,,I still think you will have to be a magician to beat Tim Burton's Batman film's but Nolan has is well on his way to becoming Houdini. This is a film that describe's Batman as he was in the comics and i think as Bob Kane imagined...So how has Nolan done it..Simple..i've seen the xtras on the Region 2 DVD and it appears that he didn't rush anything and really worked hard on this and recruited the best of the best in the movie making business,it's an extremely hard character to portray and a risky franchise as a director to do a good job as Joel Schumacher found out. He has had some good films like The Lost Boys etc but his take on the Batman was purely a joke and i think he had potentially ruined a huge money making franchise...But however it has been saved with Nolan's amazing take on Gotham and Christian Bale's Dark Knight which truly is an amazing likeness to the comics,,,This film has everything that we wanted and more because it has a beginning a middle and an amazing end which makes batfan's itching for more and a sequel which promises just that,,,it has an all star cast too,Morgan Freeman and doing an amazing job in succeeding the great Michael Gough's Alfred we have Michael Caine..The villain is the Scarecrow but in true Gotham Style there are more corrupt going's on in Gotham than good and who are they gonna call to clean it up..Simple.....THE BATMAN...This film has more gadget's and lifelike special effects than any other Batman Film so it's definitely one to watch..Thanks and i hope you enjoy it as much as i did.."
"For those of you who were disappointed with the last few Batman movies, 'Batman Begins' redeems the caped crusader in a big way. 'Batman Begins' takes us on a journey through Bruce Wayne's tragic past again, giving us a real insight into what drives and fuels his quest against suffering and injustice. We discover how the billionaire came to be trained in the martial arts, develop his alter ego, and acquire his technological arsenal. Christian Bale gives us a riveting performance as not only a very dark hero, but also a tortured soul looking for the means to combat the wrongs of society, a society that we see is also responsible for the death of his beloved parents. Another thing we notice from the beginning is this story does not tie into that of the other movies in the series. This is however not a disappointing feature, in fact it seems to breathe new life into this timeless classic. So for all of us who have followed the Dark Knight's journey's, strap yourself in for a wild and inspiring ride."
"I can only say what several critics have said before me; at last they capture the essence of the Batman legend on film! What makes this movie so great is how it takes its material so seriously. There is also a main theme that ties the movie together: Fear. It's relentless in its quest to explain why and how a man of Bruce Wayne's wealth and public persona would dress up like a bat and battle crime. This is the core of the movie, and it treats this with confidence and conviction. When a movie believes this much in the story it's telling, it's much easier for the audiences to believe in it as well. This is a big cinematic experience, and it shouldn't be missed. One of the year's best films, and quite possibly the best comic book-hero-movie of all time. If you have seen this movie once, then it gets even better by the second time you see it. And if you haven't seen it yet... well, what the hell took you so long?!"
"This is the Batman I have been waiting for! Tim Burton's Batman (Batman, Batman Returns) movies were good Tim Burton movies, but not great Batman movies. Joel Schumucher's (Batman Forever, Batman and Robin) I'm convinced were made to mock the Dark knight and destroy his good name. But this new one is everything Batman should be and needs to be. And the villains are all played to perfection! Christopher Nolan is my favorite director and this (along with Memento) is his best work. If you see no other movie this year, see Batman Begins.Note: This is not a prequel to Tim Burton's Batman. This is a completely new Batman movie series."
"this was one of my favorite movies of the year. and i don't say that lightly. i saw this movie with my friend as a backup to lords of dogtown which was sold out and boy am i glad i did. Christian Bale did an amazing job with the tough role of being batman. i then saw this with my cousin who loved it as well. this is probably the best superhero movie I've ever seen. superman, horrible. batman, OK. spider-man the first one, OK. spider-man 2, boring. and so on. but this, this was amazing. it was well worth the 10 dollars to see it and i cant wait until it comes out on DVD. one of the best movies of the year and it deserves to be in the top 10."
"Saw a free screening on Tuesday. I must say, I had my expectations low for this one, as the previous Batman franchises was just cartoony, over the top, and flat out mind dumbing. Why do studios continually think that spending money on 'bankable stars' and special effects will make a ton of money on box office receipts? Granted ""Batman Begins"" has a pretty sizable budget, but they made the right decision with casting actors that can act and hiring a director that shares the same vision of the comic book. You will not see any caricatures of the comic book, but rather be immersed in how Bruce Wayne has that internal conflict of morality as he becomes Batman. Christopher Nolan takes his time developing Bruce Wayne's character in the image that Bob Kane had with his own flair to it. Anyone familiar with Nolan, Christian Bale, and Cillian Murphy's work will not be disappointed with this movie. Make no mistake about it, it is a dark movie, which is what makes it so great. Nolan uses CG effects very sparingly (thank God!).I rarely give movies a 10 out of 10, as I am pretty brutal with ratings, but Nolan resurrects a failed franchise. Personally, this is what Batman should have been all along - The Dark Knight! Anyone who is a Batman, Nolan, Bale, Murphy fan will not be disappointed. I only wish I took that money I spent on ""Star Wars: ... Sith"" went to ""Batman""."
"yup, this film made me cry. it really did. being a hardcore batman fan, i assume i know every little secret, history, background about the dark knight. i've waited 13 grueling years (discounting batman forever and batman & robin for reasons far too obvious) to see a decent BATMAN film. Not only is Batman Begins decent, it has got to be one of THE BEST FILM EVER! i watched the film on its last screening together with my friends in Alabang. after the movie, the entire theater was deserted and i just sat there, still trying to catch my breath. It is that damn good.Christian Bale plays the perfect Batman/Bruce Wayne. Charming, handsome, and ""rich,"" as Wayne. Terrifying, maniacal, sadistic, and blacker than black as Batman. ""It's not who i am underneath, but what i do that defines me."" Michael Caine as Alfred, humorous, he is the rock of the Batman family. Almost always, the exchange between Bale and Caine where Christian tells him ""You still haven't given up on me, have you?"" Caine answers ""Nevah."" Morgan Freeman as Luscious Fox. Quite different from the character in the real Batman mythology (which for me is the comic books), but important nonetheless. He's told in the film as the one who supplies Bruce with all of his ""spilunking"" stuff. :) Morgan plays it brilliantly, from his face in the Tumbler while Bruce is driving, to his deadpan humor near the ending of the film. ""Didn't you get the memo?"" That got one of the biggest laughs in the theater.Liam Neeson, Liam Neeson. Awesome! As Henri Ducard and the real Ra's Al Ghul, he was cold, beyond reason. Cold, bad-ass in a great way. Esp. the scenes where he and Bruce were in their ninja suits playing a game of ""hide-and-seek"" with all those ninjas. Some of the best lines came from Neeson's Ducard character. ""Are you ready to begin? Katie Holmes. She's actually the ""weakest"" link as far as all reviewers or critics are concerned, but for a fan, well, she actually is. Not weak, but pretty much, the film could have gone without her. Having her die at the end of the movie would have made an even better way to start the Begins sequel given Batman's occasional experiences with deaths that he feels responsible for. (i.e. the drowned girl in the VENOM series, Jason Todd) But she does put some nice boy meets girl syndrome during the early years of Bruce. (Oh, speaking of history, Bruce Wayne did NOT finish college nor did he finish in Princeton) And, imho, the end scenes where she and Bruce kissed was ABSOLUTELY YUCKY! i dunno, but for me, it was totally unnecessary but seeing as how the protagonist and the girl should kiss even once in a movie scheme held up, well, there ya go. ""You better run!"" Cillian Murphy as the Scarecrow actually should have gotten more screen time. He was really scary even in his ""doctor"" mode. the first time we get to see the mask during his talk with Falcone, awesome. We really got to see the extent of how this lean, geeky fellow could actually become one of Batman's worst enemies. Ken Watanabe, very limited screen time. Doggone good nonetheless.and who could forget...Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon. ""I have to get me one of those."" Damn right. ""I think you're trying to help."" Can't wait for the next Batman sequel just for the fact that i'd love to see more of Jim Gordon's interaction with the Batman.Overall, this movie gets a perfect 10 out of 5 stars :) This movie has it all. Great plot, dialogue, action, and an array of Oscar caliber actors, definitely, Batman renaissance has begun. Batman Begins."
"Over the years the Gotham City that was once a dark place lined with evil and corruption, in desperate need of a hero, deteriorated into a circus tent of Hollywood displays with over-dramatic architecture and special effects... Where criminals dance around in blacklight sensitive face paint and so-called villains compete for best comedic performance. Behind all the bright lights and all-star celebrity casting, we lost grasp of what the saga is really about: Batman.Batman Begins opens with Bruce Wayne's discovery as a little boy of an underground cave where he is traumatized by an attack of massive waves of thousands of hideous bats. From this incident came an instilled fear that will forever torment Bruce Wayne. After the death of his parents, a deep hatred towards crime grows more and more until Bruce decides to vanish from Gotham City. He learns the skills of an ancient vigilante ninja organization, developing not only the skills of martial arts but most importantly the mastery of fear- skills that will ultimately be the best weapons in facing the evils that will reach Gotham City and to avenge the death of his beloved parents.Batman Begins restores the integrity of the Batman saga and goes into an even deeper conflict... his constant struggle with fear and his deep hatred towards everything evil. What the other Batman movies lightly touched on, Batman Begins tells vividly. Why a billionaire would devote his life to fighting evil. Where he gets all his nifty convenient gadgets. Why Bruce Wayne can take on 30 armed guys all on his own and without a gun. And finally why he dresses up as a bat... after all ""A guy who dresses up as a bat... clearly has issues."" And Batman does and should have issues, especially after witnessing first hand the death of his loving parents, deaths that he feels partly responsible for. The other movies didn't emphasize enough the true anger Bruce Wayne has towards those that commit to a life of evil, but in this movie, Batman, effectively played by Christian Bale, is clearly depicted as a man anxious to release his anger and frustration to avenge the death of his parents.Evil is definitely present in this movie. Where the villains in previous Batman movies seem like decent people to hang out with, or in Poison Ivy's case make out with, the enemies in this movie know there is a job to be done and that there is no time to be funny- not to belittle Jack Nicholson's role of the Joker, who has a right to be funny. The depiction of the Scarecrow was amazing, possessing an evil presence unlike any other Batman villain.As much as I loved Tim Burton's work, and Michael Keaton's portrayal of Bruce Wayne/Batman, I'd have to say that the direction of Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale as Batman put together the best Batman movie ever made. Besides Christian Bale, the casting was impressive. Alfred, played by Michael Caine and Fox, played by Morgan Freeman, are both characters you'll be glad to have alongside Bruce Wayne.It really is refreshing to see Batman and to finally learn after decades who he really is. A Batman who is angry and troubled and there to kick some ass not just for show but with a passion. Now the legend can live on with dignity and generations from now on can see the true man behind the bat... not just some heartthrob in tight pants."
"Forget the others. They tended to be comedic in comparison (no pun intended). It always seemed to be about who had the bigger codpiece, or the sexier heroine.The Batman comics and graphic novels are much more than costumes and special effects. While those things to play a large roll in bringing the audience into the story and keeping them engaged, the storyline and plot, as well as solid character development are as important, if not more important. The cast(Bale as The Bat and Caine as Alfred...brilliant!) is unparalleled. The direction keeps with the dark, brooding theme that makes the Batman comics so intriguing. The storyline and the morality story presented are timeless. Anticipating the next in the series with excitement! A must see and a must add to one's movie library!"
"Finally someone has got it right.The beginning of batman from the perspective of the original DC comic with a few added twists to render this film the best of all the Batman Genre.All the artists are fantastic and this film should go down well with all Batman enthusiasts as it is in my opinion an in depth portrayal of the beginning of the Black Crusader and his commitment to combat all evil.Having been an avid reader of the Batman series in the past,the film tries very hard to explain Father/son bond which unfortunately could not be realized due to the sudden killing of both his parents.It would now be interesting to know how the next Batman film will begin.Could it be with a joker?Who knows!"
"This, in my opinion, is the best Batman movie I've seen so far!When I went to go see it in theaters, I was so excited! I knew that this Batman movie was going to be a blast. I was right, I think that it actually turned out better then I thought it would be.Now don't get me wrong at all, I liked the other Batmans, but this one is like The Godfather compared to them. It has an awesome storyline to it and the cast is spectacular!I think that they made an excellent decision making Christian Bale play Batman, he's certainly good at it! Besides Keaton, Christian Bale makes Batman... Batman!10 stars out of 10"
"This film is by far the best superhero film to date with maybe the exception of V For Vendetta. It is a fantastic reinvention of the genre none the less. Christian Bale is absolutely brilliant in this he owns Batman in this film he shows how Bruce Wayne became Batman and shows the emotions behind his crusade. He makes Bruce Wayne the main character not Batman. This realism is what makes the film so revolutionary it is by far the most realistic superhero film I have ever seen. Batman doesn't defy the laws of physics, Gotham isn't an over blown fantasy it looks as it could really exist in the states and the villains aren't fake people there real criminals. The cast is brilliant and its not dominated by American's with the exception of Holmes and Freeman. The main cast, the major characters are all British/Irish brilliant actors none the less. The writing in this tale is also masterful as it is heavily influenced by Frank Miller and other Batman comics. This is a film you need to see however you can."
"Christopher has become one of my favourites directors with only three feature films in his curriculum: Memento (one of the best and original thrillers if not the best I've ever seen), Imsomnia (very solid thriller) and Batman Begins.This new Batman it's entertainment at its very best. Christian Bale portrays a visceral, angry, human and noble Batman; he is the best Bruce Wayne/Batman I've seen and will ever see on screen. The casting, together with the direction and production design of this movie are flawless. The film attempts to portray the beginnings of the Bat-Man set in an almost real world, very different from the Gothic surreal caricaturesque world that Tim Burton created in his Bat films. I just love this film and I am eager to see Nolan's next movie soon! The guy is a very intelligent and talented director."
"When I went to see this movie I had not seen any of the other Batman movies. I did not know what to expect. However, I was very, very impressed. This movie thoroughly explains how 'Batman' all came to be. After watching the movie I became a Batman fan and rented all the Batman movies from the 1990s. Even after watching them all, I still felt that Batman Begins was the best. This movie was...what do I want to say...'Dark' would probably be the best word. The other Batman movies use cheesy humor to cover up the flaws in the plot. However, this movie had a more serious approach - showing how the whole Batman storyline became. I absolutely loved this movie and look forward to seeing the sequel (hopefully)."
"This movie is truly inspiring to us Batman fans out there. It's hard to believe that Christian Bale once weighed 130 lbs for one role and then shot up to 220 lbs, before trimming down to 190 lbs for Batman. This man is truly devoted to his work and it shows. Just look at certain interviews about how he portrays the character Bruce Wayne. It's almost as if Christian Bale does research and takes notes on Batman before he starts acting the part out. He makes all the right moves because he surrounds himself with a great group of actors. We can all relate to Bruce Wayne's character in some way and this is where we can thank Bale. Who else could've done it better? BATMAN IS BACK THANKS TO Christian BALE! I just hope the best is yet to come and he sticks with this role."
"I loved Batman and Batman Returns, Tim Burton's direction and Michael Keaton's Batman were really good, and seemed to be the best we were ever going to get.I'm glad to say that i was wrong, Christopher Nolan has taken the character of Batman to the very beginning, fleshing out the characters of both Bruce Wayne and Batman down to the finest details. Nolan's use of realism in the creating the Batman character makes him more believable than ever.Christian Bale quite simply personified the character of Bruce Wayne/Batman and actually puts everyone else's portrayal in the shadows. Bale is supported by a wonderful cast, including Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and more, but i found Cillian Murphy's performance as Dr. Jonathon Crane to be one of the finest in the movie.Overall Batman begins is an very honest, detailed and compelling adaptation of the Batman character, that is worthy of the recognition it has received. For Bat fans and movie lovers alike; this is a must see.9/10"
"Christian bale has always been a fantastic actor, ever since he first lead role as a 10 year old in Spielberg's 'empire of the sun'. Batman begins breathed a new life into the batman franchise, after the extremely disappointing clooney flick. Christian bale is by far the best batman till now and played both the roles of Bruce wayne and the caped crusader with great style and perfection.you can sense the terror in the voice of the batman, and for once the batman looks scary indeed. Chris Nolan succeeds in creating a crime infested Gotham city whose only hope is its favourite son, Bruce Wayne. compared to spider-man, superman, x-men, daredevil and any other superhero movie, it's for sure that this movie will blow your mind and leave you gasping ans screaming for a sequel. brilliant acting and flawless direction.10/10"
"This is the best rendition of Batman ever. Perhaps for the first time a movie is better than the original comic. What makes this movie so great is the character development of Bruce Wayne and casts surrounding him being perfect. Sure the looks and the mood builds on the ""Dark Knight"" version of the Batman of the '90s, but this is more intelligently done, and every i's are dotted and t's crossed on it's plot, character depiction, and special gadgetry that Batman always flaunts.The part I especially like is the fact goodness of each character comes through despite the gloomy visuals of Gotham city. Even in a dump, there're hopes with people like them. The line at the end of the movie where Gordon says ""I never thanked you."", and Batman turns around and says ""...and you never have to."" is just killer.10/10"
"Being a fan of Nolan's previous work, I went into this with high expectations, and yet somehow, my expectations were surpassed. My congratulations to the entire cast and crew for making such a phenomenal film.It all begins with the story. Nolan and Goyer didn't just adapt from the comic book, they re- imagined and re-invented Batman and his world while staying true to it. I might even say what they did was in some ways better than the comic book. Things in the comic book that would probably seem preposterous in a live action film are brought to life in an intelligent way, like the reason for the costume, and the reason for the villains and their costumes. I won't go too much into the story, because I think it's best for people to go into this film knowing as little as possible.Christian Bale IS Bruce Wayne, and IS Batman. It will be hard to ever see someone else play the role. The look on his face when Joe Chill walks out of the courtroom... That demonic voice he gives Batman... The way he tries to hide his pain when he's told that ""the apple has fallen far from the tree""... an incredible performance. The rest of the cast is fantastic too, with Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman dishing out some great humor.And the film looks great. Gotham actually looks like a real city (with nods to Blade Runner), the lighting is nice and contrasty, and Batman is believable as a flesh and blood character. Even the flying scenes are handled nicely. It's hard to talk about this film without giving things away. If you haven't seen it, please see do. You won't be disappointed. I'd like to thank Warner Brothers for letting an intelligent and talented filmmaker make this film without much interference. Please make more like this one."
"Batman Begins, the much hyped, much publicised 'reboot' of the Batman franchise is finally here and boy what a treat it is! I was a big fan of Tim Burton's take on Batman, his portrayal of the dark knight as a brooding and reluctant bringer of justice, I always felt fit perfectly with the imagery of the comic books and gave a great feel to the whole Batman mythology. The following outings of Batman Forever and Batman and Robin, were less than splendid though. Over-blown campy nonsense with two-dimensional characters being upstaged by a campy over the top rouges-gallery of villains.So here is the re-boot. The beginning. Batman begins breaks from the convention of other comic book films. The first act of the film is told through flashbacks and does not follow a linear editing style. It gives a fantastic insight into Bruce Wayne's feelings towards his origins and his motivation for becoming the Dark Knight. It traces his path from young boy, to troubled young man; unable to vent the anger he feels for injustice he has suffered at the hand of the criminal element.Bruce Wayne attempts to confront his demons head on, but soon realises he is just one man in a corrupt and frightening world. The film takes us on the journey Bruce endures in trying to find what it is he needs to do to come to terms with his past and to guide his future. He travels the world and seeks out a means to better himself both mentally and physically. He trains with masters of martial arts, to learn the fighting skills and mental strength he will require to bring justice back to Gotham. This all provides the very convincing back-story of the transition from Bruce Wayne to Batman.Without giving too much of the plot away, Bruce travels back to Gotham and begins his quest for justice. It shows how he equips himself and the conflict he has within when dealing with the criminals of the city. It also shows what other Batman films have failed to show. The trouble of living a double life when you are a billionaire playboy. Bruce has to find balance between his public image as Batman and his public image as a rich, businessman and socialite.The film climaxes with an awesome final act, showcasing immense fight scenes, brilliant use of the new Batmobile, gorgeous sets and intense acting. The final scenes set the film up perfectly for any sequels and all the while maintains the sense of realism and down to earthiness that Nolan promised.Batman Begins is well written, well-shot and combines amazing special effects, set design and acting to form a perfect final package. This is without a shadow of a doubt, the best comic-book movie I have ever seen. Christian Bale puts in a sterling performance as Bruce Wayne, often reminiscent of his role as a businessman in American Psycho. He is also very convincing of a man driven to fight injustice, a man with a troubled past and a man seeking what he must do to come to terms with it. He is also entirely convincing as the all-action hero Batman, disposing of criminals with his expert martial arts training enthusiasm for justice.The supporting cast is perfect. Michael Caine is an inspired choice for Alfred. There is good chemistry between him and Bale and you are left convinced that they have a quasi-father/son relationship and that Alfred genuinely cares for his young master. Gary Oldman plays a brilliant Sgt Gordon, the last honest copy, torn between misguided loyalty to the force and an honest will to protect the innocent. Cillian Murphy plays a reserved, but entirely psychotic proto-super villain and Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson, as always provide strong character roles. Holmes was a fine leading lady, but I couldn't help feeling she didn't really have enough to do in this film, however only a minor criticism.Batman Begins is a dark film, centred on strong themes of fear, over coming demons of your past and the fight for justice in a corrupt world. Unlike many comic book films, this film is not in anyway aimed at children. It is not strictly adult in nature, but follows intelligent character development, adult conflict and complex portrayals of the characters. Most comic book films introduce your hero as good because he wants to save the world and the villain bad because he wants to take over the world. Then the action begins. This is not the case with Batman Begins, it gives insight into each character's motivation and reasons for their actions, it does not expect the audience to blindly accept anything on face value.Well done to Goyer and Nolan for producing such an awesome movie. When I left the cinema, everyone in the audience was grinning at the end of the film, knowing they had just seen the beginning of something rather special. Bring on the sequels!"
"This latest Batman film disappointed a lot of people....but not me. I appreciated it because they didn't overdo the violence, didn''t have a stupid romance angle to muddy up the real story, and fount it an interesting history of how Batman became Batman. The first hour of this ""prequel"" dealt with his origins. If you're a fan of the comic book stories and the other Batman films, this part in the film should not bore you. It was like a documentary to me, about a topic I was interested in. In fact, on the second viewing I enjoyed this even more.Christian Bale did a fine job as the latest Batman. It's too bad there have been so many actors playing this role, ruining the continuity of this latest series. I hope Bale continues with a few more efforts with this character.It was nice to see Michael Caine in the role of ""Alfred."" He was excellent and the stabilizing force of the story. Katie Holmes did not have anywhere near as big a role, or romantic one, as I expected, and that was fine with me. I just enjoyed looking at her face, leaving it go at that. Gary Oldman was also interesting as a low-key young detective Gordon who would go on to become Commissioner Gordon in all the other episodes (but, once again, played by another actor.)The film ends with what would be the beginning of the first Batman, featuring ""The Joker.""After having seen all the Batman films several times, I now think is the best of them all....perhaps an unpopular choice, but that's my opinion. Don't let the naysayers keep you from watching this movie. You might be missing the best of the Batmans!"
"At last it appears evident that Hollywood have listened and made the superhero more believable. Batman through Bale is an honest character easily related to his alter-ego. The enemy is normal (compared to the green goblin and nuclear man!), and the City although futuristic allows the audience a certain mystical sincerity. Bale is strong as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The underpin to the story line depicting how Wayne became Batman is well written and acted. There is of cause the usual moral picture painted through Wayne and his childhood friend emphasizing that revenge is a negative motivation in cleaning up Gotham. Good kit and a great car... 2008 is marked up for the follow up with Bale in the lead role again, keep up the good work and we hope Superman is as REAL."
"The best film I have seen so far in 2005. It had everything, action and a little romance. but not enough to distract you from the main story line. Forget all the Batman films of the past and look to the future. Batman is back, bigger and better. The stunts are great, and add to the plot instead of being the hole story. And for once the supporting actors don't let you down. They actually boosted the story and helped to keep the plot moving in the right direction. Unlike those in the Btman films of the past. When Batman Begins comes out on DVD in October I will be buying the 2 disc set and I hope you will too. When the next Batman film hits the big screen I will be the first in line to see it, and being a woman that must mean a great deal."
"Last night, I went to check out Batman Begins, and I only have one word for the tone of this film: perfect.Absolutey nailed. Blasted out the park. A grand slam.The folks responsible for this adaptation of the Dark Knight simply ""got it."" 100%.Batman is a persona that was created to inspire fear into the hearts of criminals. A creature of the night that hunts from the shadows, strikes without warning, and vanishes into the darkness like a nightmare. The character is never meant to be seen by the general public, he is merely meant to exist in their whispers, an urban myth that is talked about in hushed tones throughout Gotham City.Batman does not have a ""Bat Credit Card"", and he doesn't attend charity auctions or débutante balls. He doesn't drive around the city streets in the Batmobile in broad daylight, waving to cheering citizens. He doesn't have a ""Bat Phone"" that connects him to the commissioner. He doesn't wear a costume with rubber nipples or operate vehicles with spinning neon turbine engines and open cockpits. He doesn't crack jokes like, ""It's the car, right? Chicks dig the car."" All of these things are wrong, wrong, WRONG...and this movie understands that. It understands that and washes all of these injustices away until they are nothing more than a faded bad memory. Screenwriter David Goyer and director Christopher Nolan have given us a film that treats the character with respect; a loud, thrilling masterpiece that doesn't insult your intelligence or bombard you with inappropriate campy antics.Christian Bale gives us a Batman that will scare the living crap out of you. His voice is a gravelly, menacing sound, and when he yells at some poor schmuck to get some information, it's downright terrifying. He swoops out of darkened alleys, hitting fast and furious. He's brutal, cold, and calculating. In short, he's everything that anybody who ever put that cape and cowl on is not. Perfection.The villains are also amazing, but a huge part of their contributions to the overall brilliance of the film is their failure to dominate it. The previous Batman movies were plagued by these cackling idiots in ludicrous costumes who pushed Batman to the back burner. In Batman Begins, we finally get to spend some time with the hero, learning who he really is behind the mask.Not to imply that the villains are poorly fleshed out or inconsequential to the story - quite the opposite in fact. Cillian Murphy is a very effective Scarecrow, turning in a subdued, but intensely creepy performance as a warped psychiatrist who uses fear gas on his victims, unleashing horrifying hallucinations. Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai) is a shadowy Tibetian criminal warlord named Ra's Al Ghul, who watches over young Bruce Wayne's training with Ducard, played by Liam Neeson. But things are not what they appear with this situation, and a shocking twist comes into play towards the climax. The rest of the cast is solid, especially Gary Oldman, who finally gives us a competent, intelligent James Gordon. Essentially, the movie is about fear. Confronting it, learning from it, using it, and conquering it. It's a dark, serious film that leaves little room for humor, but some sneaks through in the form of some witty exchanges between loyal butler Alfred (a brilliant Michael Caine), and Bruce Wayne.This movie is awesome and a complete triumph for DC, Warner Brothers, Nolan, and everyone else involved.. Run, don't walk, to the theater. Amazing."
"This movie is one of the best movies ever made, if not the best in my opinion. I never had my hopes up of it being anywhere near as good as what it turned out to be. People that have not seen it I urge you to take a look because it's worth it. I bought the DVD collector's edition and will cherish it for the rest of my life. Trust me I never bought a DVD movie let alone a DVD collector's edition for any other movie before. I just can't wait to see the sequel.Hopefully they keep most of the original crew so it has the same atmosphere from Batman Begins cause if they do, it'll be another kick-ass movie."
"It's such a rarity when a director of Christopher Nolan's caliber and background decides to take on or rather expand on a franchise of this magnitude, especially after two of its more than imperfect outings were considered a flop. Similarities were bound to emerge and making comparisons was extremely easy to account here since there was both the good and the bad to look back at.I tried to keep my expectations at a normal high, even though the product was featuring a cast of very respectable actors and a stellar director. Batman Begins starts out with an somewhat orthodox style of comic-to-film story-telling, something every film of similar roots needs to do in order to build the much needed momentum. I guess after witnessing the wide range of actors portraying Batman, I was positively anesthetized and open to what Bale had to bring to the table, more so since I've enjoyed majority of his work. As the many well known actors started to resurface within the story, to no ones surprise their delivery and level of sophistication was unwavering and well intended, but since the film was set to revive the series and basically start from scratch, I enjoyed the freshness of Cillian Murphy more than I did of the others. However don't let this serve as a negative since the present ensemble was far more superior than the circus crew of the last two films.So with actors in place and a story rolling with strong force, it was the action that had the potential to further prosper the experience. Unfortunately not much action was present this time around, and I say 'this time' because the ending feel of this film in a sense was similar to that of Spider Man 1. No, it didn't share the lightness and tiring melodrama of Spider Man, on the contrary it was far more suitably darker, but as the movie was nearing the end there was a feel of something more grandiose lurking in the path of Batman. As much as I like to be teased ultimately I was left hungry for more conflict between the good and the evil. But with the main villain taking his leave of absence for the most part of the film, the deeds of the troublemakers were left in the hands of two characters, Falcone and Crane, both of whom were made to look rather harmless and easily subdued. As Ducard made his way to Gotham, not enough time was left for him to wreak havoc and again I can' be too harsh since the movie had a lot of ground to cover and understandably not enough time to simultaneously improve and originate on every level.On it's own Batman Begins was a good effort, compared to last two films it was flawless, but the fact that it could evolve from this form to something better, is a notion that keeps me leaning on the good side of things rather than the not so good."
"It had some original stuff that displayed intelligence and thought with regards to his suit, car and weaponry. It did try to dwell on Bruce a lot more and convey some of his darkness but I found towards the end it became very Hollywood-ised. Sometimes filmmakers try to over complicate things and this was a good example.I don't know why they can't have a simple bad guy with a simple plan, why do they have to be so elaborate a plot leaving a growing feeling of inevitability that by the end there will be some big explosions, building destruction, lots of flashing lights and Batman will prevail.The inability of seeing the fighting was immensely frustrating. I don't think I saw him actually land a single punch. It seems a fight scene would be imminent and the makers would speed up the camera, ramp up the bass on the sound, scatter the scene with crunching thuds and smacks but then forget to actually choreograph a fight. Maybe believing that if we heard the thuds and saw some activity on the screen that the audience would imagine the rest and think 'wow, what a scene'. I'd much rather have two or three clearly thrown punches or kicks than 1-2 minutes of whirling cape, bangs and crashes and people falling to the ground.It's a shame that they re-launch the franchise in a blaze of 'this is going to be darker and different' which it certainly starts off doing before descending a little bit into Hollywood banality. Why not have the courage to really shake things up, have the bravery to maybe end it badly (taking T3's lead) or just not conform to the normal formula.Showed promise, had some clever stuff and made more of an effort than some in the franchise but still nothing to rival Batman:Mask of the Phantasm as the best batman ever made in my opinion."
"I knew from the beginning of production of this film that the Batman franchise and legacy was in good hands. Although the choice of Christopher Nolan as the director is an unconventional one...I knew he could make crap into gold with his talents. The cast is unbelievable, the special effects are dazzling enough that they don't steal from the story like in previous superhero films. Also unlike previous superhero films(namely the other Batman films) they don't hand the movie over to a mega-star actor as an over-the-top villain. They rather give talented actors enough screen time to get their character across.The story was very much true to the comic book. It explains the origins of the character of Bruce Wayne, and proves that you don't need to be ""Superpowered"" to become a super-hero. The film starts with Bruce Wayne(Christian Bale), as a hermit traveling the world (mostly in areas reminiscent to Japan) starting fights with thugs and petty criminals to shadow over his guilt over the death of his parents, Thomas Wayne (played with sincerity by Linus Roache) and Martha Wayne. He is greeted by the mysterious Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson),who promises that he and a legendary warrior Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe) can teach him to turn fear against those who prey on the fearful. Bruce takes him up on his offer and learns to become a warrior of justice. But when he is asked by his mentor, Ducard, to kill a prisoner, he refuses...claiming that his compassion is the only thing that separates he and his enemies. Bruce is nearly killed as a result, only to survive and return to Gotham and become the hero he was born to be.He begins with his Bat-Suit, weaponry, etc., and of course the Tumbler (bat-mobile). Along for the ride are his trusty Butler, Alfred (Michael Caine), the head of science divisions at Wayne Enterprises, Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), the only decent Cop left in Gotham, Sgt. Gordon (Gary Oldman), and his old flame, now the assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes (the ever annoying Katie Holmes). Things are worse than ever in Gotham...Carmine Falcone, a mobster, owns most of the city's officials, and as he runs drugs and gambling, those officials turn a blind eye to his malevolence. Things get extra precarious when Falcone sparks up a deal with Dr. Jonathon Crane aka The Scarecrow and his employer...Ra's Al Ghul. Now Batman must put his trust in his allies's hands and turn his fear on his enemies to save Gotham from a Truly horrific fate. Most of the performances are nothing short of incredible. Bale shines as the caped crusader and Bruce Wayne. Proving that he can play characters other than say American Psychos. Bale shows many different sides to Bruce. You can tell by looking in Bale's eyes that his innocence has been shed long before it should have and now he only has his fear to guide him. As Batman, he does something different. Unlike Michael Keaton (still one of the best), Val Kilmer, or George Clooney...Bale shields his voice by sounding and behaving almost like a vicious animal, creating a voice that sounds like Alec Baldwin after drinking one too many shots of vodka. Caine does an Oscar worthy job as Alfred. He does more justice to the character, showing him as more a father figure than just a hand servant. Caine especially can nearly bring tears to your eyes when he speaks of how he'll never give up on Bruce. Liam Neeson didn't really surprise me with his Jedi-like mentor of a character in the beginning, I just saw it as Neeson being Neeson, but he really proved me wrong by the end of the film. (Spoiler ahead) Neeson returns at the end of the movie only under his real name...Ra's Al Ghul. Not surprising considering he looks and sounds like the character from the comic books. Neeson goes from teacher and father figure to oozing with villainy and suave sophistication in his fight scenes w/ Bale. As for the supporting cast...Morgan Freeman is fantastic as a no nonsense scientist at Wayne Enterprises. Freeman adds an elegance, strength, and above all, presence to this movie with very little screen time...much like Marlon Brando in Superman. As for Katie Holmes ...she does what she has to do in the whole ""...it's what you do that defines you."" fortune telling crap, which I really didn't care too much for. But, in the end, her character comes off more as a self-centered pain, who wants to be noticed as a hero, which is not the way her character was most likely supposed to be played as. Gary Oldman does what Neeson does...he plays against type. Neeson is usually cast as a mentor/good guy...and now shines as a heavy. Oldman is usually cast as a psychotic and over-the-top villain...but he now plays a sincere and trust worthy cop...and works great with Bale. From the first shot of Oldman as Gordon, consoling young Bruce after his parent's death, you get the feeling that he's a good man, one with a conscience and dignity. Murphy does an especially good job as the Scarecrow...many would complain of his reality based re-creation...but i think it was the only way to do it without turning the Scarecrow into a cartoon character. Murphy also emits a great villainous flare with the delivery of lines like ""The Bat-man."" Tom Wilkinson and Rutger Hauer contribute well to their side-villain performances. Wilkinson seems to enjoy himself with his Italian, tough guy accent, and Hauer fits the role of a greedy, corporate S.O.B. very well. As for Ken Watanabe, he fills out quite well as the ""Ra's Al Ghul"" we meet in the beginning. Iv'e always admired Watanabe and his choice to play such a small but vital cameo still puzzles me. Never the less, after his ""Gotham must be destroyed speech."" I don't think I could see anyone else play the villainous role like that."
"OK.. So i don't want to make this long.I went to the Wizard Wolrd Comic Con on Saturday June 4th and they had a special showing of Batman Begins at the IMAX theater in King Of Prussia. Well.. It was Awesome. I am a huge comic book fan and this made me very happy. It is on par if not better then Batman 1.The movie has a scene here or there that is only so so, but you forget about that by the end. Anything they change in history is easy to forgive too because it works so well and makes a lot of sense.All the actors did a great job. I thought to many big names would be bad.. i commend you ALL... i knew Christian and Gary would be perfect and they WERE.. Katie, Michael and Morgan i was worried about (no offense to them, just for the roles) and they did awesome. Katie Holmes actually really did a great job. I gained a lot of respect for her abilities.Overall.. SEE IT.. i would have been willing to pay so much to see it early and getting a free showing made it that much sweeter. I have to see it again on opening night and then a week later for my brothers last night as a free man.. and i cant wait... GET OUT THERE AND SEE IT.. well.. when it opens :) THANK YOU to all who made this movie happen.. you really gave a great film that will hopefully get the taste of the last two (i know.. new franchise) out of our mouths."
"This movie came out 14 years ago. Throghout these 14 years I've watched this movis at least 50 times. . . If not 200 . . .
For a batman fan this is a dream come true, Nolan and Bayle made it happen!!!! They brought this iconic charachter to life, from the graphic novel to life. They've actually made Batman greater the he had ever been.
Christian Bayle is without a doubt the best actor to depict Bruce Wayne, untill this movie it was Michael Keaton, since this movie no one NO ONE can be batman anymore! It will always be Christian.
Burton's movies were a fantasy, with a comic twist.
Nolan's movies made Batman real, made sence of his personal experiences and how the collaborated to his personality, made sence of how he created his alter ego.
Since this movie came out many things have happened, two seqwels came out, each one better than the other. And then WB started to make fun of us DC fans casting Ben Afleck as Bruce Wayne . . . Serously?!
Bottom line, if you have seen this movie at least one time in the past 14 years , who are an alien?! Watch it !!!!"
"It is the perceft origin movie,the movie always keep you interested with its realistic tone and good written charachters"
"In my opinion this is the best Superhero movie ever. The Batman origin is told perfectly, the actors are great. The movie has a perfect pacing.
I think this one is great, superior to the beloved 2nd Part of the trilogy."
"Batman is back! and he's meaner, tougher, and more like Bat-Man then ever before! This is Bat-Man, this is how he's supposed to be portrayed on screen. The Cast is perfect with the exception of Katie Holmes. Everything works dramatically, from the training scene in act 1 to the transformation into the Batman in act 2, and to the grand finale at the end of act 3.Christian Bale nails the roles as Bruce Wayne and Batman (he just about nails every role he's in) He plays it straight and adds a scary as hell voice to an already brooding Dark Knight!The rest of the cast is exceptional! This movie is unlike any other comic book movie ever made.First off the director is Christopher Nolan, not a blockbuster, mega, stupid director. Nolan is smart and helms an intimate, realistic, emotional film of the dark knight! The cast is the best cast ever assembled for this type of genre! The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking! thanks to Wally Pfister! This movie is so special because it's not a comic book movie, it's just a great movie! wonderfully acted! superbly directed! etc. etc. Let's hope the sequel will be made in this fashion! With Nolan on board it would be hard to imagine otherwise! **** out of ****!!!"
"Those who aren't Batman fans. I don't care. See this movie as soon as you can. Because this is one of the best movies ever. For sure the best Batman. And for those who like Batman, this will make you love it. Every thing is perfect. The cast, Gotham city, the suit and gadgets and especially the car. It's all FANTASTIC! We finally get to find out how he got everything, why he did it and how he does it. In other words how the dark knight ""Begins"". Those who know about Batman{Which is pretty much everybody.} should already know the plot, so I pretty much don't have to tell the story. And say you don't know about Batman, that's what the movie is going to do. So, go see how Batman Begins. Because you will never regret for seeing this. What do you got to lose?"
"It is according to me the best movie of 2005. I am not a great Batman fan and was really not that keen to watch the movie. But I saw it and I was enthralled from beginning to end. The movie makes an awesome impact and has me converted to a Batman fan. The story is beautifully depicted and it is very easy to identify with each and every feeling of the hero. He comes across as very humane and not as some action-figure involved in mindless stunts. Also, it is truly amazing that the director has handled such a complicated plot so skillfully without the confusing the viewer or making him/her loose patience. I think the casting of the movie was perfect and Christian Bale is simply perfect as Batman. The case was the strongest plus of the movie. Also technically it was superb and extremely slick. Very well done indeed.I am waiting desperately for the sequel."
"Christian Bale plays the best Batman in any of the movies yet. Bruce Wayne a man feared and afraid of bats. His final true resolution is to fight crime in a black suit and as that he gets a name from his victims, The Batman. This movie is action packed and loaded with drama and comedy Batman's character is shown more in this movie than in the others. In the other movies they show the story of the villain but in this they show more of Batman's story. This isn't taking from the other movies. I don't care what most of you say about how bad this is and what a terrible movie and could have been better. This movie is the best true Batman movie and this is a movie for the animal the bats"
"I originally wrote something much longer but I had to cut a lot of it. When I first herd that a new batman movie was coming out I as over the moon. However, that quickly faded away when I discovered that it was not to be a sequel to the sequel to the sequel to the sequel or even a prequel but it was to be a remake. This initially put me off because I thought, 'How the hell can you top the original?' It's a classic; we all know this. Eventually I got that itch, I'm a movie fanatic and I just love watching movies from Finding Nemo to The Godfather, from Star Wars to Old Boy. I watch pretty much anything and everything and like anything and everything. You do sometimes just get those movies that are a cut above the rest. I can safely say that this is one of them. I can also say accurately that this is one of the best movies I've seen this year because we are at the end of it, nearly. I hate it when in March you have people saying the best movie of the year, I didn't know that 3 months was a year...The Writing - David S. Goyer, I love the dude. I do, I thought the Blade Trilogy was awesome and the Threshold pilot he wrote was definitely a great start to a gripping series. I have not seen many of Nolan's movies but he's a fellow Londoner who's made it big stateside and co-wrote a good screenplay, so I gotta give him his proper respects. The Cast - It's good that it had such a huge amount of talented actors from the UK. Christian Bale is just an amazing actor and anyone who says otherwise probably thinks that a lamppost could act better. Then you got veterans like Morgan Freeman who is one of the greatest black actors if not actors in general to ever grace the screen, if I do say so myself. I think Caine portrayed Alfred very well. Liam Neeson played the bad guy very well and I also liked the fact that the bad guy was just as normal as Batman himself. I didn't even recognise Gary Oldman who is an actor I love because he just plays the bad guy so well in some of his other movies. It was good seeing him be the good guy though. Tom Wilkinson played Falcone and did a very convincing accent. Katie Holmes was OK at best in her role. I just felt she didn't really sell it that much, she wasn't impacting enough. Now, I know all those actors are greatbut I really have to say bravo to Cillian Murphy  this guy is someone to watch out for. 28 Days Later was definitely his big break and I'm just amazed he pulled off an American accent so well; I almost forgot he was Irish. He is definitely a versatile talent and a great UK import. I feel that American cinema might see a lot more of him in the future.The Batmobile - I think it's the best one so far, although the others were pretty awesome. I do honestly wish I had one, If I did, I would laugh at anyone thinking their special because they have a Porche  my damn car has a flamethrower as an exhaust pipe!The Story - I very much enjoyed the story and I think it really showed his origin. I liked the fact that everything was done in a very real way. All the gadgets pertained to present day perhaps 5 or 6 years on and they were not something that looked like it came out of a cereal box. This story is something that could very well happen in our world. The fact that Batman is just an ordinary frail man in a suit was really brought out a lot more in this movie. I was actually waiting for some silly super villain to come along but he/she never did which fitted the feel of the movie. I like the little ode to The Joker too, maybe that's a hint he will appear in the next one.Complaints - Although I really really enjoy watching all the Marvel and DC movie adaptations my only complaint is that well they are PGs and 12s which means they are childish and watered down. I mean to be honest I find it quite silly that not one person in these moves says the F word or anything because to me that's unrealistic. In real life people swear, a lot. If the things that happen to people in these movies were to happen to me real life I know for sure I'd be cussing my head off. In the real world you don't get criminals watching what they say because they are breaking the law; I think censorship is the least of their worries. I did not enjoy the very fast editing for the fight scenes, I could hardly see what was going on. Did anyone actually hit anyone or did they just wave their arms and legs around near each others faces?Overall this is a brilliant movie and I think it's safe to say that a new Batman Franchise is on the horizon. With the expectation of the ""Untitled Batman Begins Sequel"" that should be called ""Batman Continues"" if you ask me, I think there will be at least 2 more movies. I'm glad to see that Goyer is on board to direct the 2008 movie and that Bale is returning for the second but --The question is will they all star Bale as The Dark Knight or will Warner randomly switch it up like before?"
"I've never had a thing for Batman films. I watched the cartoons when I was about 8. That was alright. Nothing special though. And not to forget...I was only 8. I always thought batman is just not one of those things for me.This film however has changed my mind. I can't wait until the next one! Christopher Nolan presented an almost believable story in this 2:20 hour blockbuster movie. I especially liked the way Nolan described the fear of bats Wayne develops in his youth and the way his father was a big influence in his life. Casting was very good... Normally I would have given an 8 for this film, but because it was able to totally change my mind about the batman theme i think it really deserves a bit higher. That's why 9/10!!"
"My review on Batman Begins: Director: Christopher Nolan (Greatly known for ""Following"" and ""Memento"") Cast: Christian Bale (Bruce Wayne/Batman), Katie Holmes (Rachel Dawes), Michael Caine (Alfred), Liam Neeson (Ducard). Morgan Freeman (Lucius Fox), Ken Watanbe (Ra' Al Ghul), Gary Oldman (Jeff Gordon) Review: Three words folks- better than Burton!!! I thought Tim Burton's ""Batman"" (1989) will reign supreme as Michael Keaton being the ultimate Batman, boy I was dead wrong... Chris Nolan did an astonishing accomplishment with Batman Begins in terms of the comic book and realism. He masterfully created the surreal world of Gotham City with his combination to perfection. The character development for Bruce Wayne was unbelievable and most impressive. Wayne's alter-ego ""Batman"" was truly revived to a substantial level compared to any Batman ever created, dark and dreary as ever! Forget the eye-candy, the script and cast were just superb!!! Chirstian Bale just proved to be the ultimate Batman. Michael Caine's portrayal as Alfred was amazing. Although I must admit I did not find Katie Holmes to be that much of an appealing character, nevertheless that is my opinion. Freeman and Neeson were also brilliant. As for Ken Watanbe, I wish he had more words to say... I love his acting and totally enjoyed his character as Katsumoto in ""The Last Samurai"". By the way Gary Oldman is the perfect Jeff Gordon! In terms of other elements, you will notice how things are very well connected and relevant to the plot, especially clichés linking Wayne with Batman. Everything is slowly revealed and put together like completing a copious jigsaw puzzle one by one. Visual Effects were dazzling along with sound effects. The Batman action sequences were just the way they should be, quick and deadly. Some may complain that it was a bit choppy but Nolan, as being a great director, knows what he is exactly doing. He is simply portraying the legendary masked crusader. The Batmobile was transformed into a more realistic version which is a great example how Nolan mixed realism into the movie. Digital Gotham was artistically incredible.I must confess I was literally in awe after watching this masterpiece. If you're looking for the summer blockbuster of 2005, this is it. Enjoy! ~puNk"
"When I first heard a about this new batman movie I wasn't too sure about, I'm not really a batman fan but I have seen the past movies and I enjoyed all of them (apart from the 1997 batman film). A friend of mine saw this movie and said it was that good and before I watched this movie I played the game, the game was alright but could have been much much better and little clips I saw of the movie seemed to look good so when I heard it was coming out on DVD I wanted to see for myself what it was like. I waited a week to go to the video store rent and it was worth the wait. I thought the movie was fantastic, I enjoyed every part of this film and thought Christian Bale did a brilliant job of playing the dark knight. Brilliant film."
"I was never really a fan off the batman movies, i did enjoy Batan and Batman returns and felt Forver was starting to get shaky, until the total disappointment surrounding Batman And Robin. Although the creators of this film Batman Begins have showed just how well a comic can be made into a film. The Film is about fear and how people must turn to face it in order to scare their opponents into submission, and Batman, the man crawling in the shadows and lurking in dark corners begins to put the fear into his opponents. The film shows a man fighting for his home town and fighting for which everything his parents build up, although to protect the town of Gotham and the people in it Bruce Wayne/Batman has to go to extreme lengths and risk his life to save the town that he loves and which his parents built.The actors in this film such as Chrisphother Nolan give of a brilliant performance. He catches the essence of Batman better than any Batman i have ever watched on a film before and also creates a whole new story to Bruce Waynes life. With help from fellow actors Micheal Caine, Katie Holmes and Cillian Murphy they create a film with action and flare with an unbelievable story. A must see! Lets just hope there more careful this time is they continue to re-make the older version... and Robin maybe he should be left in his nest!"
"After Batman & Robin I have not counted that I would see anything worse (or better for that matter) with Batman on the big screen. And, surprise surprise, here it is - a good Batman movie, with great Christian Bale as Bruce W., and fantastic Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon (he finally got a positive character, that nut). And it's just the top of the great names here, followed by Rudger Hauer, Morgan Freeman, and Michael Caine as Alfred.The movie itself is much more comics-faithful than any previous part. It's dark and bleak, although not that sinister as Batman comics can be (especially from the post-Frank Miller era). We finally can have a good look on Gotham and how vast it is. I didn't like though the bad guys, one of which is a loser with a bag on his head, and the other a former Jedi master, who also happened to train Bruce Wayne in martial arts. Overall, a great entertainment foreseeing even better next parts."
"This time it's different,Batman is really dark and really, really good. Most of the other movies centered in the infamous villains but now the tables have turned and it's batman's chance to shine on the silver screen with his training to become the dark knight till his battle movies, he is the star. This movie really made me feel like a kid again, i was just watching for my watch cause i didn't want the movie to be over..i just didn't want it to be over but at the end i felt it was great..loved lot of scenes in it and the ending was cool..i can't wait for a sequel. The Villains were real enough to make the movie feel realistic and the bat-mobile is spectacular...i will definitely give it a 10 out of 10 on cool Comic adapted movie."
"Batman Begins is the best Batman in the TDK trilogy I put this move above ""The Dark Knight"" It is my second personal favorite Batman movie of all time. I enjoy this movie more than the 2008 sequel. It is revitalized the Superhero Genre not only for DC Comics but for the Batman character. Christian Bale a very capable talent with his own sense of mystery and darkness was perfect casting. Excellent acting in Liam Neeson, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer among other talents seen in the film and the results are exceptionally brilliant and well executed.""It's Not Who I am Underneath, It's What I Do.""I love this film to death, it is my second personal favorite comic book superhero Batman movie. Batman Begins most certainly brought back Batman in a big and important way. Christopher Nolan brings back Batman to his roots how he become a cape crusader to fight againts evil in a Gotham City. It is miles way film better than Batman & Robin I hate that film, Batman Returns or The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises. Because Rises in my opinion is not that good than the first two Batman movies.After 1997 Batman & Robin was a critical Box Office failure and Joel Schumacher destroyed the Batman saga. Warner Bros. canceled the fifth film Batman Unchained. But Christopher Nolan reedem the characther him self, he directed this masterpiece well and rebooted this film. For year 2005 I am super happy this movie come out! It was portrayed right by comic books and this movie did it right. it was, dark fantasy, has multiple actions and explosions. I love the plot. Batman Begins is the ultimate Batman origin story that everyone should see. I love the cast everyone of the actors and actresses did a fine job at acting. Showing us the roots of how Bruce Wayne become a Batman kicking ass superhero taking no names. I love how Gotham City is portrayed in this movie. The second hour is worth watching it has a great point how Ra's al Ghul try's to poison with to vaporize Gotham's water supply, rendering Crane's drug airborne and causing mass hysteria that will destroy the Gotham City.Batman in this movie fights off Carmine ""The Roman"" Falcone the most powerful Mafia boss in Gotham, Dr. Jonathan Crane / Scarecrow and of course Ra's al Ghul his former mentor who trained Bruce (the art of ninjitsu becoming a ninja) who brings League of Shadows with him, who are secret ninja assassins to destroy Gotham City. Here we have Arkham Asylum portrayed by the comic books they way the Asylum is. SWAT guys chasing Batman in Asylum and he calls bats to help him dsitract the cops. We have a great fight on the train betwen Ra's al Ghul and Batman. Great car chase cops chasing The Tumbler on the road. Rachel fires her taser in Crane/ Scarecrow's face while riding a horse. Batman saves Rachel from Carmine's thugs. Batman climbs the walls. I love this movie, it is a beautiful masterpiece. I love Hans Zimmer for this Batman I love his music score tune, most powerful score I have heared. I love Batman costum, fantastic excellent designed. love that this movie is dark and violent real fantasy of Gotham City.Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman cape crusader was excellent his best performance ever. I love Michael Keaton, but Bale's performance was better. I enjoy this movie and I enjoy Bale's performence in this movie he really surprised me. Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes was abolutelly the best of the film. Been a huge fan of Katie since Dawson's Creek and her movies Disturbing Behavior, Teaching Mrs. Tingle and Go. She use to be my favorite actress until Tom Cruise come along since than she wasn't anymore in the movies. Since than I lost respeact to Holmes. I love Katie as Rachel Dawes Bruce's love interest. Liam Neeson as Henri Ducard / Ra's al Ghul I have to sey this men is the best actor of all time. He played both of characters Ducard and Ra's both of characters were writen on his skin. He stole this show. He is performance is the best of this film. Liam Neeson completely charmed me with his acting his best acting I have ever seen. Cillian Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane / Scarecrow was to me the best villian in this movie. Fantastic performance from Cillian Murphy. Rutger Hauer as William Earle I have respeact for him too, this year he past away.The problems and negatives I have with this film are: the first hour is really boring it goes so slow around that I was bored. The pacing in the first hour is so slow I prefer the second hour more. Superman the movie (1978) is better the first hour of origin it is not boring goes fast around this movie does not do that. In this film we have to wait an hour till we see Batman. The fight scenes in which Batman fight off thugs and Ra's Al Ghul are terrible shot because the camera is way to close so we fans dosen't see who hit's who. A lot of fans compained about the fight scenes, they could have been better, not that they were shot at close. The fight between Ra's and Batman could have been longer and better performed, but they werent. Those are my negatives, but the film is wonderful it self, superhero comic book dark action fantasy.I Recommend Batman Begins to any fan I love 89 Batman, Batman Begins Batman Forever and The Dark Knight, so it is my second personal favorite Batman superhero comic book movie of all time with Tim Burton's 89 Batman."
"This film is a start for a Christopher Nolan Batman film series (which I hope will continue for a long time). This film is not that good as The Dark Knight but much better than earlier Batman movies. The film is taking itself more seriously and that is what's good about it. I liked the plot very much and also a colorful characters. Maybe the film itself isn't that good as The Dark Knight but the action here is much better and here is much more of it(especially the fighting scenes). A plot, action, acting, costuming, direction - everything was great in this film. So just watch it, especially if you are action movie fan because there is a lot of action."
"This is certainly, without question the best Batman film ever made, although that isn't saying much. Christopher Nolan makes this into a very dark and brooding tale that tells more about Bruce Wayne than Batman, something the other movies would never have done. Nolan is a great director and he takes a great leap of faith by showing perhaps the most important screen superhero in such a way that the city of Gotham and its components don't feel like taken from a comic book, but from real life. Batman Begins is based more on graphic novels and the original characters by Bob Kane, so the realism and details are there without all the fluff and showboating Joel Schumacher would have put out. Christian Bale is perfect as the title character and he creates a more interesting Bruce Wayne than Batman only because we see more of Wayne in this installment. All other roles are perfectly cast, especially Liam Neeson as a mysterious yet intelligent and brutal member of the League of Shadows. Katie Holmes is nice and sweet as Wayne's childhood friend, and there will never be another Alfred as long as Michael Caine resides.Simply put, Batman Begins is worth the time and money. It pulls you into a world you would never expect to see in a Batman movie, than transports you to Gothan City, the rotting core of it mostly. When we do get a glimpse of Batman, it really is quite different than other interpretations. The action here is based more on suspense than violence and the plot moves along quite well to make this movie feel shorter than its 140 minute running time. So, if you are going to see The Dark Knight this weekend, be sure to check this out first. Indeed, if it is anything like this one, this franchise is going somewhere truly spectacular."
"This is the best superhero movie ever. Although that is yet to be seen because I haven't seen the The Dark Knight yet. The reason this rises above the other superhero movies is that it such a much more believable and well told story then the other movies.This tells us how Batman became the dark knight and what made him who he is. We see Batman become a warrior and return to Gotham City and face off against his first nemesis the scarecrow. He is also reunited with his first love Rachel played by Katie Holmes. The Batmobile was awesome it was a tank basically. The bat suit was great. It looked like a samurai suit. This movie had almost everything that made Batman. The Batmobile, the bat suit, the bat cave, the love story and the evil villain. Batman was a renegade in this movie. So that means no terrible sidekick called Robin.There is always a love story in a superhero movie and this one does throw out that tradition. This one is between Batman and his childhood friend Rachel. Rachel is a DA and she is fighting in court while Bruce Wayne is being a playboy. I found it to be a pretty damn realistic love story. A good love story is hard to find in movies these days. Even the love story is a reason to watch this movie.Now to the villain. The Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy in a great performance) was great he was scary, creepy and a total evil person. He uses a gas to poison his victims and that causes them to see there fears. He was a very satisfying villain. Another reason to see it.Now to the acting. Christian bale was a great Batman. He suited it so well. The only thing that was weird was the voice he did when he was Batman. When he was Bruce Wayne he was excellent. A total different performance between the two. Michael Caine was superb (like always) as Bruce's butler. It didn't even seem like he was trying. Gary Oldman is one of the best actors today. Whether you are watching him as Sirius Black in Harry Potter or Zorg in The fifth element he is always giving us a different performance. Again he is gave us a totally new performance in Batman Begins. He is different in every movie he is in. Katie Holmes played Batman's love interest. Let me just say she pulled it off. She was good but unfortunately she was worst performance in this movie. She just didn't get above the rest of her co- stars. That doesn't mean she wasn't good. But she has been replace in The Dark Knight by Maggie Gyllenhaal. We will see how she does in it. I highly recommend this if you like superhero movies or have seen the other Batman movies. This a great addition to anyone's collection.10/10"
"When asked who your favourite superhero was, these 3 are some of the biggest household names. We have now seen all of them portrayed in a recent movie (or 3 in spiderman's case) and we are confronted once again with the burning question of who is the greatest...To compare all of them, batman is the most human with no extreme alien qualities such as web or superhuman strength. Batman relies on technology and his incredible fighting techniques to destroy his enemy. It is impossible to relate to any of these superheroes yet the human factor of Batman makes him a far more interesting character. That and his car...Spiderman is of course a legend, he needs to keep up the much more difficult facade of Peter Parker compared to the other 2 heroes. The popularity of spiderman is noteworthy and the 3rd movie is a testament to this.Superman is the least imaginative of all the superheroes mainly because his superpowers are clichéd and unimaginative. The latest superman movie was by far the biggest waste of film in the last 50 years. Never before have I hated a movie so passionately. Smallville however is a different story, it has all the makings of an awesome beginning to superman. Except.... As with so many series, if it takes off in its first season, the writers crave a bigger paycheck and in their endless greed the storyline goes straight to hell. Sad but true.So, in conclusion Batman is the clear winner in this skirmish with Spiderman in a close second! Unfortunately superman falls way back, and as they say, ""Those who fall behind, stay behind""."
"This is the best movie about Batman bar none. This is an excellent film , it can't really even be classified as a comic book Super Hero movie. It is that good. Great characters , great story, and of course great action. I highly recommend buying the DVD, you won't be disappointed.Christan Bale is totally believable as Bruce Wayne and Batman. Unlike the previous movies Batman is the star of the film. Also there are no campy elements or corny one liners. And the car!! Batman's car in this movie is exactly what a vigilante would need or use in the real world , because a sports car can be stopped, not this baby. No neon lights, no huge fins , no nonsense, Batman's new ride is awesome. Keaton did a fine performance as Batman , but I had a hard time believing he was Bruce , and physically Batman. Bale came in with the height , build , and attitude. Chris Nolan did an outstanding job directing this instant classic."
"Christopher Nolan has done what no other movie director has had the courage to do. Make a Batman film with such dedication to the character that it simply is the best comic book character adaptation I have yet to see.If you are prone to reading attention disorders, you might has well skip this thread. I warn you up front it is a long on so you might move on, nothing for you to see here. If you are interested in an in-depth review which will contain some spoilers, then let's dance for a bit.Christian Bale has hands down stole the mantle of the Batman and made it his own. Nolan was wise enough and also had the insight that the Batman is actually a hell of a lot more of an interesting character than the twisted villains that have stolen the limelight in the previous films. Bruce Wayne/Batman is a very complex multifaceted human being. Anyone who follows the comics knows that Batman is borderline psychotic. That is his appeal. Nolan knows this, uses it to the fullest and fleshes out the character from his comic book incarnation and makes him flesh and blood.The development takes us back to the tragedy that spawned Bruce's thirst for validity. The child actor who played Bruce Wayne as a boy was for me the scariest choice that Nolan had to make. He chose wisely. We see Bruce's grief and isolation through this child as well as the surrogate father Alfred becomes. Yet even Alfred, played wonderfully by Michael Caine, cannot cross the threshold into Bruce's private hell. He can only stand back and be there for the young Wayne. We also see why Bruce Wayne chooses the bat as his symbol and his mantle. The scene when the adult Bruce meets his fear in the cave is truly inspiring.So how did Bruce Wayne learn all his tricks of the trade? Nolan takes us somewhere to Tibet where Wayne gets introduced to the League of Shadows under the mysterious Decard.. Note here, Liam Neeson delivers the performance as a mentor far exceeds that of the one in Star Wars. Here given a choice at the height of his training, Wayne chooses different and departs the League that exists under the rule of Ra's Al Ghul. Then portrayed by Ken Watanbe.Nolan doesn't want to candy coat Batman. He knows his source material which makes this film stand out and frankly shame all the ones that proceeded it. Yes, I said shame. Because that is exactly what the previous films did to Batman, especially the ones done under Joel Schumaker. Who not only nearly destroyed the Batman franchise for Warner Bros. but also tried his best to destroy Val Kilmer's career when Kilmer started to clash over creative differences.This is the Batman that Miller wrote about. Obsessed, driven. It is also the first time that a director took the character from the ground up and using the source material bothered to explain just how Wayne got all those wonderful toys. Especially the Batmobile. I have read that many saw pictures of the Batmobile and wept. They wanted the Giger toy car from the previous flicks. This car is NO toy. It actually does what it does in the film This is a realistic piece of bad ass ed machinery that you definitely do NOT want on your tail. It is awesome and fear inspiring. The car itself should be considered part of the cast.In fact another stroke of genius is that Nolan doesn't overplay the cast. Gordon is played just how I envisioned him from YEAR ONE. Oldman looks just like a Sgt. Gordon I loved the little homage scene where he is taking out the trash and you see inside his brownstone apartment spying his wife eating with a very young Babs .Trust me, it is all there. Nolan made the Batman's universe real and believable.Also Nolan explains Wayne's world and shows its complication. From his drunken playboy routine that is his real mask, to the battle to get control back from the power mongrels at Wayne Enterprises. Like I said, Bruce Wayne has a complicated world. Here he has to hide his true self under the guise of a foppish Bruce Wayne. Bale displays the conflict here excellently. He has to play the buffoon so no one will know just exactly he is up to. This isolates him further limiting the number of friends within his circle. One friend, Fox, played by Morgan Freeman, who stated he took the role because Batman has always been his favorite character, supplies him with the beginnings of his arsenal. But his true confidant is Alfred, who has some of the best lines. The chemistry between Bale and Caine work so well that Alfred is actually a main player.If you are looking for huge CGI effect, watch Spiderman again. This is more gritty, the only effects are the subtle ones and the insidious effects of the Scarecrow's fear toxin. Wait until you see Batman behind the eyes of the Scarecrow after Prof Crane has had a dose of his own medicine. ""Dr Cane is not here anymore..."" Note: Don't expect a Danny Elfman score either. This score his deep, brooding and ominous. There are no frills here...just base instinct rumbling through your psyche. Well done. Warner Bros wised up. They followed a fan site named www.batmanonfilm.com for sometime after the demise by Joel Schumaker. They realized that here was a sounding board for fans of the character and learned painfully that their marketing dept was wrong. Batman is not for kids and be warned, this really isn't a kid's movie. It is a grown up film aimed at the comic book audience that grew up ages ago."
Batman Begins is definitely the best Batman movie to date and one of the better movies of 2005 and of all time. The real credit to this movie should go to director Christopher Nolan who has produced a brilliant movie. This movie is so great because it does something that the other Batman movies didn't..... show exactly how different (and better) Batman is from other heroes and superheroes. The acting was brilliant (with the exception of Katie Holmes). Liam Neeson would be my personal pick from this movie.But I am a bit surprised that some people are complaining about the confusion surrounding the action scenes.... for god's sake that's how it's meant to be. The confusion surrounding the fight scenes is another factor that makes Batman different.All in all it's a brilliant movie. The only thing that wasn't working for it was Katie Holmes. But I still gave it 10/10.Can't wait for the sequel.
"""Batman Begins"" finally has captured the true spirit of the character of Bruce/Batman from the comics. This live-action adaptation has been smartly directed, scripted, and cast to produce the more realistic dark nature of a human hero out to avenge his parent's murder with every criminal that threatens his Gotham City. It's the best of all the Batman movies, and stands tall next to the godfather/blueprint of all superhero movies, 1978's ""Superman"". Where ""Superman"" left off with a more campy telling of it's superhero, 'Begins' ushers in a more adult, serious take on it's mythic hero, dispensing with any camp and treating Batman seriously, grounding him in a more realistic environment that is more accessible for the audience without dumbing down the story."
"quote. When I heard they were making another Batman movie that explored the origins of Batman with promises of a much better conceived portrayal of the dark knight, I was very excited. Then, when I heard that Christian Bale who's famous for his dark and sinister characters in ""American Psycho"" and ""The Machinist"", was going to play Batman, I got even more excited. Then, the announcement that Christopher Nolan of ""Memento"" fame was picked to direct it, and I was almost certain this film was to not only be the best Batman movie in the franchise, but the best film of the year! Then I saw it.Needless to say, I was a little disappointed. The movies seemed to fall flat in a number of places. For starters, let's begin with direction. With Christopher Nolan in the drivers seat, I kind of expected a tight, clever plot with a less formulaic film style then what was presented. Sure, I mean Nolan had to stick with the script that was given to him and not tamper with the story of Batman. But I felt that the story could have been better displayed. The action scenes in the movie were too quick and flashy, leaving the characters on the screen virtually indistinguishable from one another. What I took away from the film was that it was loud and there were a lot of flashy action sequences where apparently something happened. The film seems to move too quick in some areas and too slow in others. I mean, was the entire process of becoming Batman completely necessary. At least the previous films left some sense of mystery of who Bruce Wayne was and where he got his bat gadgets. I mean, who really cares when it comes down to it? It took away from the plot of Batman Begins.Let's talk about the acting - subpar at best. Hollywood actors should have to have licences to act then Katie Holmes should have hers revoked for her role as a Assistant DA. She was about as convincing as an attorney as Denise Richards was as a nuclear scientist in that stupid James Bond movie. She was supposed to play Bruce Wayne's (Bale) love interest but the on screen chemistry between the two is laughable. Bale's acting was OK, but not like anything we've seen him do in the past. I think if he portrayed Bruce Wayne more like his psychologically tormented character Trevor Reznik in ""The Machinist"", we would have had a better movie on our hands.All in all, this movie wasn't anything special. It was your typical Hollywood formula, good guy versus bad guy, special effects extravaganza with no real value at all.A very forgettable film with bad acting, unnecessary scenes, poor direction and a penchant for overkilling the point. Yes, we understand Bruce Wayne doesn't like bats, and he has to overcome his fear and bring justice to the city of Gotham and yadayada.....blahhhhhhhhh! This oversimplified account of the story of Batman should have been given a different title - ""Batman for dummies and for people that like things that go vrooom and boooooom!"" In its defense, however, it was better than that god awful ""Batman and Robin"". If you really want to watch a good Batman movie, watch the first one. end of quote. the best it can get is 5. I voted 1 just to try to make the result balanced a bit."
"Forget Michael Keaton, forget Tim Burton....THIS IS THE BATMAN MOVIE! Perfect casting, actors that NEVER over-do it! Excellent direction...this movie does what it sets out to do...shows you just how Bruce Wayne became the ""Dark Knight"", and makes you actually care about his personal conflicts and resolve to set things right in old Gotham.Put it this way...when Christian Bale says, ""I'm Batman!"" you're glad you're not the person he's saying it to!And the special effects are dead on. For once, you get just enough techno-babble to explain how the Batman's equipment works. And you get to find out just where ""he gets all those marvelous toys"" (stolen from Jack Nicholson's Joker character in Tim Burton's ""Batman"").Enjoy this one! I'm looking forward to the next installment."
