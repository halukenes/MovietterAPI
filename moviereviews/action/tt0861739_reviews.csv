"Tropa de Elite is an amazingly good film; by turns brutally real and horrifyingly hilarious.It claims to be based on a true story and I find that sadly believable. The main plot revolves around the captain of an elite police unit trying to find a replacement for himself, while dealing with the birth of his child and the horrendous stress of his job, and a mission to clear out a dangerously violent slum.There are no wholly good people in the movie, and it's frighteningly easy to compare some of what goes on to things happening in the USA (and other places) today. That said, the system of government and policing portrayed comes across as so amazingly inept and awful that it's almost like something straight out of a nightmarish sci-fi dystopia.If I had to compare it to other movies, it comes off as a cross between Brazil, Office Space, and Full Metal Jacket. Not for the weak of stomach, and you may find yourself greatly disagreeing with the ideals of various groups portrayed (which I believe is part of the point), but I would be enormously surprised if this movie doesn't make you think and give you something to talk about."
"""City of God"" was just a perfect movie. ""Elite Squad"" goes beyond that; it's a WTF movie.Brutal realism, terrific acting (Wagner Moura... wow), brilliant script and plot, precise edition, unforgettable quotes... This movie is just insanely good.If you live in a developed country you'll probably think this is just another thriller. For anyone living in a 3rd country it's way more than that: it's a brutal picture of our degradation and corruption, a revelation that runs over you like a truck.The most striking aspect about the movie is how clearly it shows how everyone is at the same time guilty and victim in the whole war against drugs: the do-gooders NGOs, the politicians, the corrupt police and the not-corrupt but truculent ""Elite Squad"". It shows it precisely but with sense of humor and very smartly. In this war, everyone that proclaim to have moral and values is actually hiding skeletons in the closet. It's all a story of gangsters against gangsters in a degraded society."
"In 1997, before the visit of the pope to Rio de Janeiro, Captain Nascimento (Wagner Moura) from the elite squad BOPE (Special Police Operation Battalion) is assigned to eliminate the risks of the drug dealers in a dangerous slum nearby where the pope intends to be lodged. Captain Nascimento is trying to find a man to replace him because his wife is pregnant and he intends to quit the command and become a trainer of the new recruits. Meanwhile, the two idealistic friends Neto (Caio Junqueira) and Matias (André Ramiro) join the Military Police force expecting to become honest policemen and fight the criminals. However, they see only corruption, lack of competence and efficiency, manipulation of data and stupid bureaucracy in the Military Police, and after a serious incident in the Morro da Babilônia, they decide to join the BOPE. The lives of Capitain Nascimento, Neto and Matias are entwined along the next months, first in the tough training period and then in action against drug dealers. Nascimento believes that Neto could be his substitute, but his impulsive attitudes jeopardize his choice. Later, the intelligent Matias seems to be the correct choice, but he needs to prove that he has heart.""Tropa de Elite"" is the most impressive and realistic movie I have ever seen about the police forces in Rio de Janeiro and the role of the society in Brazil. In a city surrounded by more than seven hundred slums, actually lands without law and ruled by drug lords, this movie depicts the corruption of dirty policemen, the incorrect behavior of part of the society and the importance of the BOPE, a team of well trained men that can be compared to the American SWAT. The narrative in off of Captain Nascimento follows his saga, showing an obstinate man divided between his professionalism and love for his career and his family; Neto, an impulsive and honest military policeman, but not smart to be a leader; and Matias, who is studying in law school and is very intelligent and also honest, but is not totally committed with his responsibilities of policeman. The story is so realistic that seems to be a documentary with scenes very well choreographed. The direction of José Padilha is simply outstanding, using a magnificent screenplay and excellent actors and actresses. In an inevitable comparison with ""Cidade de Deus"" (""City of God""), these movies complement each other. ""Cidade de Deus"" discloses the lives of criminals, and ""Tropa de Elite"" of policemen and part of the society. This movie should be nominated to the Oscar, but unfortunately what the Academy usually selects does not correspond to the best of the cinema. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Tropa de Elite"" (""Elite Squad"")Obs: (a) On 29 September 2007, I saw this outstanding movie again with a group of friends and family. (b) ""Tropa de Elite"" was awarded with the Golden Bear of the Berlin Festival on 16 February 2008.(c) The DVD is scheduled to be released on 28 February 2008.(d) Many expressions used in this movie (""Aspira"" (""Ensign""), ""Bota no Saco"" (""Put in the Plastic Bag""), ""Pede Para Sair"" (""Ask to Get Out""), ""Você é Moleque Não é Caveira"" (""You Are a Kid, not a Skull"") etc.) have been incorporated in Brazilian Popular Culture.(e) ""Bota no Saco"" (""Put in the Plastic Bag"") the Brazilian Commission that has not selected this movie to dispute a nomination to the Oscar in the Best Foreign Language category."
"Having seen ""Cidade de Deus"" and thoroughly enjoyed it (though it is a grim tale), I was at first having high hopes for ""Tropa de Elite"". Then I thought that it could never reach the same high standards, and my hopes were lowered a great deal.About 3 months ago I happened to see about 15 minutes of the movie, and that lowered my hopes even more. How wrong I was to judge such a great movie on what must have been an unfortunate 15 minutes.I won't go into detail about the story, but it is both believable and compelling. Like ""Cidade..."" this is no fairy tale. It's the world as it is. No more, no less. Of course, there might not be that many guns blazing in reality, but I'd reckon this isn't very far off.We feel the pain, the lack of morale and the despair and hopelessness. Photography is spot on, the acting is both fantastic and realistic. ""Tropa de Elite"" never went into the big theaters here in Denmark which is rather unfortunate, since it's a true gem. Instead we get loads of mainstream crap. Not to sound arrogant, I watch loads of mainstream movies too (voluntarily, even), but it's movies like this that made me love movies as fondly as I do.Do yourself a favour. Get this on DVD. See it. Feel the pain. Immerge yourself in the desperate world. Then, after it's all over, enjoy your life, a life that will seem much, much brighter after this."
"The movie tells the story of BOPE, which is equivalent to the SWAT in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Only difference is that, in Rio, the police is so corrupt, that they often must fight for themselves.The movie has action - a lot of action-, and it also touches on deep sociological problems that plague the city to these days. It's a great compliment to City of God and, in my opinion, even better. City of God shows how the drug problem started in Rio. This movie shows where the city is now.Vagner Moura is perfect in his role. He's a great good-bad guy. The movie is brilliant."
"Kinetically filmed, ""Tropa de Elite"" reaches the dizzying heights of Fernando Meirelles' ""Cidade de Deus"", as not so much as a photocopy but more as a cinematic twin brother. Film focuses on the brutal, abet necessary foundations of Tropa de Elite, a one hundred strong company of men who swings into action when normal police gets held up themselves. Intense amount of corruption and violence is present here, however brilliantly fleshed out characters lifts the film from being trite after the 1000th gunshot.The film being presented in two parts, we are indulged into an extended prologue to get acquainted with the protagonists: Captain Nascimento, feeling the stress as a 0-1, is on the lookout for a substitute between André Matias, a law student cum policeman struggling with his own identity and Neto, the ideal candidate as his replacement who's violent and relentless to a fault. Accompanied by a sometimes distracting voice over, the audience is given proper time to find themselves immersed in the narrative and characters. Even if the film's screenplay explodes every second of its almost 2-hour running time, personality development is not left on the back seat, to much relief.Andre Ramiro's performance as André Matias is pitch perfect. Practically the film's moral backbone, he elucidates the distinction between pretending to know and knowing. The best scenes in the picture not involves scenes of brazen violent explosions but his rationalizing and character driven moments. The film uses his character to deter the judgmental audience from pretending to know but reminds them they know nothing.Padilha is in control of the film until its very last shot; able to summon his own elite squad of cinematographers and sound technicians. The production values are top notch indeed, as the cinema also explodes with every bang and boom. Filmed in cinema verite, it gathers up inspiration from previous war-themed films  from the tones and hues of the mentioned ""Cidade de Deus"" to Alfonso Cuaron's blood splatter on the screen technique from ""Children of Men"". With the sound and images pushing the audience to its nauseating edge, full immersion is delivered without breaking a sweat.Comparison to ""Cidade de Deus"" should be complementary, as ""Elite"" tackles the impotent depiction of policemen by the former. In fact, it acts as its contemporary, acting as if it exists on the same universe. It demands merit in its own right though, as the film is well staged like its depiction of training the elite, making it an involving exercise, not seen since Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"".Immersive, hypnotic and engaging, ""Tropa de Elite"" guarantees Padilha to be noticed on a more mainstream circuit. Previously delivering ""Onibus 174"", also tackling the same themes of nurture and consequence as a catalyst to violence, he is able to comment on sensitive themes without being too preachy and also able to wrap it in a well produced package. Film is definitely an above average fare and is essential to be experienced on the big screen, just for its sound design alone."
"This is one hell of a movie. I don't like to give 10 ratings to movies, because it's hard to find a movie that is excellent, but this one is.While you watch the movie it's unavoidable to compare it to City of God (Cidade de Deus), and until the middle of the movie I was thinking to my self that City Of God was a better movie then this one, but when this movie ends and I summed everything I saw, it's was harder to choose one, but I believe this one is better, for several reasons.First of all this movie has a great story, and focuses on real life issues, I'm not from Brazil, but I know some of this stuff is true. This story has emotion, feelings, twists, action, romance and even comedy for those who understand Portuguese I would say ""Bota ai na conta do Papa"" is a real funny statement. One of the things I loved about this movie was the acting, where Wagner Moura does one hell of a job, as a Captain trying to find a substitute so he can leave his job and be with his family. I wouldn't say I'm surprised because Brazilians are great actors, but still, I loved it.In conclusion, if you like action, and like City of God, then you should definitely watch this movie."
"""Tropa de Elite"" isn't merely one more Brazilian film on urban violence; it's a cathartic socio-cultural phenomenon of almost unprecedented proportions in Brazil, the omnipresent theme on TV talk shows, newspapers articles, bars and dinner tables. Prior to its theatrical release this October, ""Tropa"" was seen by an estimated record 11 million people who bought pirate DVD copies or illegally downloaded it on the net (the biggest Brazilian box-office success in the last 25 years was ""2 Filhos de Francisco"" with 5,5 million tickets sold).The reaction is passionately polarized: some call it the best Brazilian movie since ""City of God"" -- a definite influence here, in the cinematography, editing and screenplay structure, with an omniscient narrator and use of mixed chronology -- exposing the endemic corruption of Rio de Janeiro's police force and the ""unorthodox"" methods used by BOPE (the self-called ""incorruptible"" elite squad of Rio's military police force, created in 1978 and inspired by the U.S. SWAT) that include torture and shoot-first-ask-later modus operandi in the ultra-violent, ever-growing drug war in Rio's favelas. Others have publicly attacked it as fascist in its glorification of BOPE, its sadistic depiction of torture and the reductionist, simple-minded vision of the complex issues involving violence/ drugs/police corruption in Rio. Director José Padilha and co-writer Rodrigo Pimentel (a former BOPE captain who left the squad for disagreeing with its praxis) had collaborated in the extraordinary ""Bus 174"", a multi-faceted documentary on Rio's violence. In ""Tropa"", they controversially chose to give us a deliberately biased vision of the problem: from the start we're stuck with one man, the overstressed, rebellious, self-righteous Capt Nascimento (Wagner Moura) in his journey into becoming a psychopathic sadist and hot-blooded killer, who believes drug traffic is caused by the druggie middle-class bourgeoisie (as if the poor didn't do drugs!) and claims the solution is to kill all traffickers. To Nascimento, corruption is abominable; torture isn't.Nascimento is the film's absolute protagonist, narrator, commentator and ""truth-puker"". In his mind, all non-elite policemen are corrupt and incompetent, all charity NGOs in the favelas are cover-up fraudulent enterprises, all college students are useless double-faced potheads, and legal procedures are an inefficient waste of time. He's nearer to the traffickers' violent, revenge-based, lawless ethics than he's ever able to realize.""There's nothing wrong with shooting people if you shoot the right people"", used to say Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry back in the 1970s, and it could well be Capt. Nascimento's motto. He's a vigilante in uniform, in the tradition of the executioners played by Eastwood, Bronson, Stallone and 24 Hours' Jack Bauer; he's the heir to the 1970s' Brazilian military regime know-how on torture. Yet, the film tries hard at ""humanizing"" Nascimento: his wife's pregnant, his marriage falters, he's moved to tears by the suffering of a mother who lost her son in the traffic war, he's in medication for his panic attacks. AND he's trying to save the POPE's life, no less! All the other characters are just rough sketches or caricatures. The one character who might be the classical ""narrator/observer"" (like Buscapé/Rocket in ""City of God"") is the idealist, Foucault-reading aspiring police officer Mathias (though it's hard to believe an aspiring officer could afford to attend Rio's most expensive law school). But Mathias, too, is finally co-opted by the brainwashing ""Full-Metal-Jacket""-like BOPE training that changes him into an amoral beast fueled with rage.Padilha says he wanted to portray Nascimento as a monster, and that audiences who are hailing Nascimento as a ""hero"" and BOPE as a ""model"" institution have caught him by surprise -- oh, really? Padilha is probably being sarcastic, naive or silly: everybody knows movie vigilante cops have been consistently idolized the world over (and co- writer Pimentel has publicly disagreed, stating the ""Tropa"" is clearly pro-BOPE). The graphic, sadistic scenes of torture -- supposedly meant to inspire disgust -- make the delight of a large vigilante-minded part of the audience. And Wagner Moura's extraordinary, scary performance as Nascimento is unsettling: we can't dismiss him as a stupid fascist the way we dismissed inarticulate stiffs like Bronson, Seagal or Stallone. The fact is that there's now a BOPE cult-following, with BOPE's logo (a skull pierced by pistols and knives) reproduced on t-shirts and underwear, BOPE officers being cheered in the streets in their armored ""glory"", and young kids (from all social classes) mimicking the film's ""bag-in-the-head torture"" as a new bullying style. Militarists and pacifists will hardly change sides after the watching the film; militarists will have multiple orgasms and pacifists will cringe in horror. The filmmakers aren't interested in seriously discussing the drug issue (legalization is not even mentioned as an option). Nor in exposing Rio's drug traffic's multi-fingered interconnections, the zillion-dollar, highly organized international business involving farmers, money-washing executives, chemistry labs, gun-runners, bankers, politicians, accountants, lawyers, transport systems, etc. Nor in showing the real victims: the majority of the favela inhabitants, who aren't involved in the drug business but have to live under its rules, mere ""extras"" whose fate (in movies and in real life) is to be used, humiliated, segregated or, worse, wounded/killed by random bullets from BOTH policemen and traffickers. ""Tropa"" is a must-see film, but it's misleading and entrapping: by opting for an ""open"", ""what would YOU do?"" ending (probably influenced by the breathtaking finale of ""Paradise Now""), the filmmakers demands us to take sides about a very, VERY complex issue they've shown us only ONE angle of. ""Tropa"" is cinematically dazzling, but so physically and ideologically nauseating you'll need an antidote -- be sure to also watch the faceted, influential documentary ""Notícias de uma Guerra Particular"" and be aware of many other angles to a terrible reality that plagues not only Rio, but most of Third World's chaotic, no-man's-land, way out-of- control big cities."
"If you loved City of God and Carandiru, you have to see this movie. Maybe it's the most complex Brazilian movie about violence. It combines a discussion about the problem of violence in Rio de Janeiro, the police corruption and the society responsibility and, what is more important, Elite Squad is a terrific thriller: nervous, intriguing and entertaining. Cinema at it's best. Bráulio Mantovani, from City of God, wrote the screenplay and Daniel Rezend, also from CDD, is the editor (Both nominated to the Oscar).Above, one article about the film: ""WASHINGTON (Reuters Life!) characters lie dead in the street within minutes of the opening of Brazilian director Jose Padilha's new film which he hopes will shed new light on gang violence and police corruption in his country.""Elite Squad,"" which Padilha wrote with former Rio police officer Rodrigo Pimentel, follows two young Rio de Janeiro police officers as their fantasy of implementing law and order disintegrates into bloodshed and corruption.It details night raids through the makeshift homes of the city's hillside slums known as favelas, as well as the stark class differences that feed an appetite for riches among many of its poor residents.Padilha, 39, said he had originally hoped to use the information he received from Pimentel for a documentary but quickly realized that it would not be feasible.""How would I do this, go to corrupt cops with cameras?"" he asks. ""If I tried to make this film as a documentary, it would probably get me killed."" Padilha, whose highly-acclaimed debut film ""Bus 174"" about a real-life bus hijacking in Rio was released in 2002, has strived to make the film as realistic as possible, shooting much of the film on the favelas' narrow streets.""Elite Squad"" is based on Pimentel's account of his tenure as captain of Rio's elite police force which has come under attack by Amnesty International for brutality.Like ""Bus 174,"" it exposes the darker elements of Brazil that contrast vividly with the nation's colorful, extravagant Carnival celebrations."""
"Elite Squad is a most see movie. Despite all of the frenesi it's causing all around, it has a good storyline, excellent screenplay and a brilliant performance from all the cast in the movie, especially Wagner Moura who deserves all prizes he can get for this great performance.Basically the movie explores the fight between drug dealers and corrupt cops against the good policemen's, some of them from the military police force and most of them from BOPE. That's the way the director Padilha's sees this fight which is not entirely true. Although it shows how the corruption of the Military Police Force works out in Brazil, how the system is used against itself and how the bureaucracy makes everything so difficult that it's almost impossible for honest people to deal with their own personal issues without dealing with corruption. And by the way, that's entirely true.The baseline of the movie is the story of Nascimento's, who is the captain of BOPE (Special Forces Operations Battalion) which can be compared to SWAT. Nascimento needs a replacement and he needs to find the right person, someone who has all of the qualities the job demands. Two guys come up to be this person but none of them have all it takes. Neto has the attitude, the heart, but he's not smart and centered as he's best buddy Matias. The only thing they have in common which is mandatory for the job is the honesty and the will of changing things for the better.The movie has all the elements that makes us go to a movie theater. It has a storyline, it has action thriller, and it has a great performance from the cast, all of them.If you are planning to spend your money in another blockbuster, don't do it! Give a chance to this great movie that explores the WAR that we, from Rio de Janeiro, have to deal with everyday. It's not only about the fun you are going to have watching this peace of work but the truth you are going to see on it."
"Elite Squad has in my opinion surpassed the genius of Cidade de Deus. The movie is shot like a documentary, many times in fact I felt like I was intrigued and interested on how and what the police does to get around the city.It is basically about the two main characters working their way up the police academy in Rio until they reach the BOPE unit. The training is shown to be very harsh, sometimes even dehumanizing. The movie depicts life of police men in the city and what they do to overcome the unfortunate bureaucracies. I will try hold myself to not say anymore because I do not want to spoil it for you.This movie is violent. It is not unnecessary violence, because its depictions are said to be accurate. (Rio politicians have spoken about its veracity).Even the production of this masterpiece was bounded by violence. While in production, part of the crew was kidnapped. An unedited version of Elite Squad together with dozens of fake weapons were stolen as well.You will be amazed through out the whole film, thats a promise."
"This movie will certainly be seen as another (perhaps good) thriller by most of the non- Brazilian audience. But the movie is not just that, in fact, it's way more than that. Several good thriller movies plenty of violence and shootings scenes have been produced in the last couple decades. But one thing is to inject a lot of money to make a movie on gratuitous violence and rely on special effects to make it get good critics, which then bring the desired money that moves the cinema industry. This is Hollywood, and this is definitely not what Elite Squad is about. The movie has raised and keeps raising important social questions among Brazilian citizens. The way the director tells the story without taking part in any side is genial; contrary to most north American movies, there's no good or bad guy in the story, the situation got to a point where things simply are the way they are. No particular point of view prevails and the viewer gets out of the movie with mixed sensations about what to think about all he sees. Victims of Brazil violence praise Captain Nascimento character to a level of national hero, whereas he ends by being hated by many others who dispraise his ignorance on human rights. There's also a thesis in the movie sustaining that all the violence is fruit of drug commerce, which would exist because the middle and high Brazilian classes buy the drugs to sustain their hedonistic life style. These are the same people that frequent movie theaters in Brazil, create the public opinion, and constitute the Brazilian intellectual society. Therefore  independently of the thesis being right or wrong  the movie somewhat also points the finger to the audience and blames it for all the violence. I think this is also genial, but one has to live there to really feel the whip of this blaming (again, one must have a bit of Brazil culture to really appreciate this movie). While you sit with your popcorn and hope for watching a good thriller, bear in mind that the violence you are seeing in Elite Squad is happening at this very moment, and this is what distinguishes this movie from other violent movies you saw."
"Remember Cidade de Deus (City of God)? Well I think that if you saw at least one time that 2002 film, is for sure that you remember it so here is a new film that works on the same level, comes and is about the same place, of course, and that you will never forget. With this sort of introduction you may think that Tropa de Elite is another Cidade de Deus but now from the side of the police and in a way you will be right but at the same time you will not because Tropa de Elite tells a story that involves and shows different points of views, acts and, the most important thing, how different parts of the society works in a delicate but real problem in Brasil. That story has in Capitão Nascimento (Wagner Moura) our narrator and the experimented one who knows how everything works in the criminal side of Rio and who works in the BOPE (Batalhão de Operações Policiais Especiais), the elite group of the Military Police. The situation in the film is the visit of the pope Juan Pablo II to Rio in 1997 and we are going the story before this visit through the eyes of different parts of the society: the police, the drug dealers and people from the favelas, part of the high class young and of course the BOPE. The friends Neto (Caio Junqueira) and André (André Ramiro) are the other important characters in our story. They are new in the business and because of their honesty soon they will understand how everything works inside the police and how they will end fighting not only against criminals but against the entire police system where everybody steals from anywhere. With André a part of high class young will enter to the story, when he start to study at one of the best universities of Rio, but of course first they don't know who is really André so they can act in their regular way when the party time begins or when they visit the favelas in order to satisfy their addiction and their own drug business. Now you can suppose how this can end, with corrupt cops making business with drug dealers and two honest cops trying to stop that and without real hopes. Here is when the BOPE enters, the elite that is respected by the drug dealers and the one that the police goes when they can't deal with a situation inside the favelas, which is always. And here we have a fantastic character study with our narrator. The situation is that he is going to be father and his beloved retirement of the BOPE is near but only if he can find a perfect substitute. Apart of this we have the terrific and probably realistic view to the BOPE itself, showing the impressive training in order to be a Skull and their philosophy that confirms that the BOPE is only for honest people with real skills and desires to end with the crime so weak and corrupt cops MUST and will stay outside. Well the great story makes me write more about it than any other thing but is easy to describe the rest because is perfect: the setting, the impressive camera work (I believe that some scenes are stronger than any of Cidade de Deus), the direction, the research (although the film is based on the book Elite de Tropa) and of course the powerful and, for me, unknown cast (in Mexico the Cinema of Brasil, as any other except the one from Hollywood, is difficult to see on theaters or to get on DVD so personally and sadly this is only the second film from Brasil that I have seen but hell I love both a lot). Conclusion: Tropa de Elite won the Golden Bear (the top prize at the Berlin Film Festival 2008) and even I'm not the kind of viewer who cares about prizes, that sometimes are unfair, I do know how an important prize help in the distribution of a film but is true that if a film won at the most famous festivals (Venice, Berlin, Cannes, Toronto, etc) but is not at the Oscars (the case of Tropa de Elite) that film will not have any or the same attention in Mexico and of course in the US. So knowing that is very difficult to see a film from Brasil on theaters and knowing the amazing quality of Tropa de Elite, is a shame that is not having a response in my country and is far of the popularity of Cidade de Deus back in 2003. Anyway, the only thing that really matters is the fact that Tropa de Elite is by far the best film on theaters right now (in Mexico City), the best film that I have seen recently and probably the very best that I have seen this year. So this film is the film to catch this year when it arrives to your city. A MAGNIFICENT PICTURE!"
"It's the best police movie I've ever seen. It'so realistic, specially the shots. The ""microwave"" scene was also perfect!There is nothing compared to this film! I haven't seen one single person who watched this film which have seen it only once. It will surely win festivals! The film is not finished yet (someone put it in the internet illegally)and it have been incredibly so well accepted by everybody who have seen it, so we can guess how it will be when it finally be released in the Cinema. It probably have been the most searched film in the internet in Brazil the last 2 weeks.There are rumors it's censored and producers are fighting against that! Anyway, that's the best police film I've ever seen and surely the best of 2007."
"If you have enjoyed City of God or felt like something was missing on it, then this is the movie you need to see. Everything here is placed respecting the reality... Scenes are very realistic and all action makes you feel like be in part of it. It shows how policemen are involved with criminals and how many policemen are not involved at all and get blamed by society due to some bad fruits. It shows how family can get affected how two guys with same purpose can get trapped in two different situations.. And shows how a man can be changed by the environment that simply leads him to do what he must. That's how we do a great movie without wasting millions of $$$. Perfect movie, dramatic, sensitive and intelligent."
"After watching the amazing movie, City of God, a few years ago I just wanted to see more. Although Tropa de Elite has the same raw look of City of God, is different in content. Tropa de Elite is about a group of Rio de Janeiro cops that grow tired of the system and declare war against crime and corruption and literally aren't taking any prisoners to the point that you just can't help but cheer for BOPE no matter their brutal methods of interrogation. The photography is stunning and the action is extreme and realistic. You have to see this movie more than once because there is so much going in terms of plot and action that you might miss it. The story is well put together and the acting is as good as any, but what I liked the most was the sense of dread BOPE was able to inflict on the minds of criminals and corrupt cops. If you like City of God and City of Men, you will absolutely love Tropa de Elite. Highly recommended!"
"Elite Squad is an impressive and enjoyable film. It is well directed, well acted, and well worth watching.There has been a lot of criticism of Elite Squad for being fascist. Such a perspective is disappointingly superficial. Too many critics have failed to distinguish the narrative perspective from the ideological perspective of the film. Although an admittedly reactionary and authoritarian BOPE member, Captain Nascimento, narrates it, the film's primary criticisms are regarding low pay for police, systemic corruption, and, the middle class's irresponsible consumption of drugs. As for any feeling that the brutal violence is justified that a viewer may be left with, this has more to do with the fact that in certain extreme circumstances desperate times call for desperate measures."
"Well, i don't know if this movie is gonna be exported or not, maybe yes 'cause some titles is in English, but this is a must seen movie! This is a action movie showing everything occurs in the Rio de Janeiro's police. War, corruption, fears, i think this must be the Brazilian movie of the year! Let's talk about the history: Captain of BOPE (Special Police Operations Batallion in Portuguese) after some time fighting against organized crime in the slums wants to quit but before he must find a substitute.The only ones that can do the test to goes BOPE are Military Policemen. Captain soon see that he have 2 good men in hands (they are infancy friends), 1 have heart and the other intelligence, but the substitute must have the 2 attributes.The movie have about 110 minutes and keep your eyes on the screen from the beginning to end (a lot of shoot out), and title in English is Elite Squad.Well i'll stop from here, but again, this is a must seen movie if you want to see a action movie in the real life, because we here in Rio de Janeiro live this, we see this, this is our war that is bit worse other wars."
"I just love a good ol cops and robbers movie, and Elite Squad shows that it indeed is a generous cut above the rest, and along the way had snagged the Golden Bear at this year's Berlin Film Festival. If you're in for some gritty looking no holds barred movie that reflects the dangerous occupation of honest cops making a living in what's technically a war zone with the criminals, then look no further than this movie.The movie works itself on many levels, having its narrative flow giving equal opportunity to each of its subject matter. On the surface, it looks very much like Hollywood's SWAT, but only much better, with its induction and training program where rookies get groomed from the mediocre to the cream of the crop in their attempts to join the BOPE, and on another level it tells of the friendship between two newcomers to the police force, where they're face with 3 options in an organization where corruption Is rampant  join in, turn a blind eye, or wage war. An additional level which held the movie throughout its different subplots is that of the headache when it comes to management succession.When you're doing a good job, you find it difficult to either let go, or if you've come to terms with the inevitable of leaving the job that you like, finding someone appropriate to take over. It's like a father who intrinsically almost always disapproves of their daughter's boyfriends. Captain Nascimento (Wagner Moura) has this dilemma, being the leader of the crack Alpha team, he found that for the good of his family he has to leave the highly dangerous job where death is just around the corner each time they go on their missions. But in order to do so, and to ensure his men have someone able and competent to step up and replace him, he has to find new blood.Thus the story of two rookies, Neto (Caio Junqueira) and Andre Matias (Andre Ramiro), who are best of friends, but whose characters are on opposite ends of the spectrum. Neto's a hothead and acts on impulse, qualities not befitting of team players, but you cannot discount his courage. Andre's a lot more calculative and restraint, but in dwelling too much on decision making, might not be able to act decisively. These were the two options best left for Nascimento, given the rest are either corrupt or inept to have made it through the tough training.Between Neto and Andre, the latter has a lot more pathos crafted into his character, such as his ambition in being a lawyer after his uniformed stint, and this character was also based loosely on the consultant for the movie. What I particularly liked his character was how he subconsciously turned into the stereotypical view the citizens have of the cops  of being violent, unreasonable and corrupt, that save for the latter, he unwittingly becomes transformed into that mold, a disillusioned turn against his idealistic viewpoint of what a cop stands for, of becoming one of many misunderstood, honest cops.The BOPE are no angels, and are quite heavy handed in their ways, though one could also argue that extreme methods and operations are totally justifiable when in a ""war zone"" dealing with criminals armed to the teeth who have no hesitation to shoot first and to kill. Simon Yam might have left a memorable impression with his repetitive bitch slapping of a gangster at an arcade in PTU, but here, such slapping gets ten times worse with the hairdryer effect too. The BOPE officers knows no gentle negotiation techniques, with arsenals such as the use of deadly force, interrogation through the use of incessant slaps and the plastic bag for suffocation, and if the suspect still doesn't crack, there's still the good old broomstick shoved into the rear.Action junkies would find that Elite Squad has no lack of set action pieces, though you might find yourself clamouring for more. These guys are highly trained and bears no qualms in exercising deadly force with no remorse, and when their skull end knives emblem comes rolling around, criminals flee in fear. Given that this is set in the gritty streets of Rio de Janeiro, the shaky cam seems impossible not to be utilized, so if you're those who feel nauseous at the erratic movement of the camera, you might want to take the necessary precautions.For me, it's not often always to have a movie like this work on all fronts, from acting to action to a tightly designed and layered narrative. If I were to recommend a movie about cops, then Elite Squad would join the ranks of personal favourites like PTU and Heat. Highly recommended!"
"Wow! What a movie! It's breathtaking! I've seen it yesterday at Belgrades Film Festival, and I'm still thinking about it. It's very raw and very true, so powerful! It's about life in poor areas of Rio De Janeiro. It's about everyday life that most of us can not imagine for a minute, but on the other hand, the characters in this movie live this kind of life almost without wanting to live different.When the movie is over it makes you think about what is the price of living, and what is the price for your life, and the life of people around you.The camera and editing are great, and the actors gave their best... Wow! What a movie..."
"Excellent and thrilling film based on real events . 1997, Captain Nascimento (Wagner Mouraw , this character was based on screenwriter Rodrigo Pimentel) has to find a substitute for his occupation while trying to take down drug dealers and criminals before the Pope comes to Rio De Janeiro, Brazil . On the streets of Rio only the elite survive . The movie deals about BOPE , a Special Operations Squad similar to American SWAT and their fight against factions in Favelas Rio Janeiro . Nascimento have to choose a replacement between Neto (Junqueira) and Matias (Andre Ramiro , this role was based on screenwriter André Batista , former members of the BOPE squad) who leads the dangerous assignment to take down the drug-lords . This stirring film has breathless , brutal scenes , a gut punch of an action film . It concerns on a special unit of urban combat taking on the daily challenges of dealing with pressure at home and fighting an unnamed war on Rio Janeiro slums . Interesting and brooding screenplay from the Academy Award nominated writer of City of God . Many critics have considered as a tremendous movie , on the level of some of the Martin Scorsese or Francis Ford Coppola pictures . A must see, a cross between the Departed , The Wire and City of God . It's a thought-provoking and clever studio of an Elite Squad , about police corruption , and unflinching remark at the underbelly of Rio Janeiro , plenty of drug-lords , burglars and assassins . Runtime film is overlong but it's fast moving and for that reason isn't boring but it's entertaining . The picture grossed at box office , it had a total public of 2.4 million paying viewers while playing in theaters in Brazil , in addition to the estimated 11 million who watched the bootleg copies and got a final version slightly different from the pirated one. In fact , this film was already a best-seller almost three months before its official release . Illegal copies of what the director called the ""3rd cut"" flooded the streets of all major capitals in Brazil, for the equivalent of five dollars a piece . The characters are based on actual people , as Andre Matias was a member of BOPE and was a honest man who finds himself torn between his life as a BOPE member and his life long dreams of being a lawyer . Exciting as well as moving musical score . Composer Pedro Bromfman is the man behind Padilha's critically acclaimed sensation ""Elite Squad"" and the smash hit sequel and he's re-teamed with the filmmaker for ""RoboCop"" .Direction by Jose Padilha is awesome , stylish , and overuse Steadycam ; this award-winning Brazilian filmmaker directed this ¨Elite Squad¨ and sequel , the smash hit followup , ¨Elite Squad: The Enemy Within¨ both of them have been monster hits in his native Brazil and beyond . Director José Padilha claimed that this movie ends his trilogy about urban violence in major Brazilian cities . The first one, Ônibus 174 (2002), was a documentary meant to explain how the state's indifference towards poor people can lead to the formation of violent criminals . The second, Elite Squad (2007), meant to explain how the state's indifference towards law enforcement agencies will often result in police brutality and corrupt officers . And finally, the last movie deals with the reasons behind the state's choice to ignore the poor and the police . These movies were Brazil's official submission to the Best Foreign Language Film category of the Academy Awards . These films had a lot of box office , about 11.1 million paying viewers made it the most seen movie in Brazilian cinema history . It also became the highest-grossing film of all time in Brazil, beating Avatar . The first feature film in English for this director resulted to be RoboCop , making his Hollywood debut , and inventively breaks down ,reconfigures and soups up the core half-man, half-machine cop-hero conceit."
"When the ""favela reality"" movies seem to be running out of 'ideas' - trying to profit by copying the acclaimed ""City of God"" over and over -, director José Padilha (of the equally engrossing documentary ""Bus 174"") brings us ""Tropa de Elite"" (""Elite Squad""), the most controversial Brazilian film in a long time, having sold millions of pirated DVD copies even before its theatrical release (and still managed to become the biggest Brazilian movie event of 2007).""Elite Squad"" shows the routine of a group of cops in Rio de Janeiro, and the inhumane training they have to go through in order to become a BOPE (Special Police Operation Battalion) captain, the policemen who are supposed to fight drug trafficking, in the rawest possible way. Wagner Moura (""God Is Brazilian""), one of the most versatile Brazilian actors of his generation, delivers a bravura performance as Captain Nascimento, who wants to quit his job in order to dedicate himself to his newly-born son, but has an important mission before that: finding the right replacement. ""Elite Squad"" is not as stylized or visually compelling as Fernando Meirelles/Kátia Lund's ""City of God"" (the comparison is inevitable), but that's not a flaw. The movie is violent but realistic, far from sheer Hollywood gore-fest (i.e. Scorsese's over-hyped ""The Departed""), and offers some extremely provocative discussions about Brazil's social chaos - and also a disarmingly blunt, love it or hate it narration. Surprise winner of the Golden Bear at the 2008 Berlin Film Festival (competing with other strong titles, including Paul Thomas Anderson's brilliant ""There Will Be Blood""), ""Elite Squad"" is a must-see. 10/10."
"From Brazil with fury: Tropa de Elite shows us, with realistic violence, all the horrors of the drug war in Rio de Janeiro ""favelas"" (slums). Many other movies shows us the violence and crime of Brazil, first of all the pulp masterpiece ""City of God"". The same authors of that movie, in this case, explore the world of police. The movie is narrated by Capt. Do Nascimento, a real officer (with a fake name). He's an officer in the elite military police Corp, the Bope. A black uniform with a skull as its symbol (two elements that remind Fascism) to fight the crime. They don't make interrogations: they torture suspects to obtain informations. They don't arrest: they just have to kill. This Corp is employed for extreme emergency, in the most dangerous areas where the police is armless. 1997: before the visit of Pope John Paul II in Brazil, Bope is deployed in favelas, cleaning them from criminals. The violence of special forces is needed if you want the Pope live and able to speak about peace and fraternity to Brazilian people. In that period, Do Nascimento explain us the career of two Bope's volunteers: agents Neto and Matias, from their beginning in the regular police to their initiation in Bope's parallel universe.SPOILERS -They can't make a career in the regular police because they are too honest to accept all the corruption and the compromises inside it's hierarchy. And so, they have to turn violent and enter the Bope to fight the crime seriously. This is a personal trail full of sacrifices. Neto loses his life in action. Do Nascimento destroys his family. Matias loses part of his humanity: his love affair, his promising career in law. Finally he loses his sense of pity. And he becomes a real war machine. Those sacrifices are inevitable in an uncompromising World in which you have only to choose between criminality and repression. Because all the other rings of the chain are corrupted. Intellectuals preaches theories against an abstract ""repression"" and they don't understand the crime. Social workers are compromised with criminals (violently punished by them if they don't obey) and they simply can't do the good for society. Regular police (the State) is itself corrupted by criminals. And then: only brute force (with all its horrors) can fight the crime. Tropa de Elite is not only a good movie about Brazil. Its message is universal. Those who repeat that ""in real World white and black don't exist, there is only Grey"" are wrong. Padilha show us how criminality oblige us to make a radical choice. A choice not easy, not at all."
"It's really weird to see a movie with an impact and an intensity as big as in Tropa de Elite.This is an excellent film.The film exposes a valid and important message and I admired the professionalism showed on a lot of scenes.It's a real pleasure to watch a professional movie.Director José Padilha made a perfect work.His direction is precise and he could extract very natural performances from all the actors,who do not seem to be acting.The only fail I found on this movie is the ending which is pretty abrupt.In spite of that,I recommend Tropa de Elite with a lot of enthusiasm for many reasons,specially for being a professional movie which is not something we see everyday."
"Rumor has it that until this film Brazilian cinema tended to portray criminals as endearing types cleverer than police. ""Elite Squad"" pulls no punches: Cops can be as corrupt as criminals. Such candor has seldom been seen since ""Serpico"" in long gone 1974. Sadly, profit-seeking films increasingly replace human beings with cost-cutting special effects in tune with our age of technological brainwashing. At least in ""Elite Squad"" human beings still feel human, however unpleasant they might be. The central figure is Captain Nascimento who has no qualms about torturing or killing criminals and corrupt cops are especially not safe from him. He sees himself as the ideal leader but he is disintegrating under stress and has a glorified vision of his powers which he cannot quite reproduce with his wife at home. Human rights groups will have a field day listing all the violations - but survival is crucial in the nether world, be it Rio or any other place on the planet. Despite its violence and amorality this film has highly effective moments of comic relief. I would like to praise the excellent direction by José Padilha and the generally superb acting, with special plaudits for Wagner Moura, Caio Junqueira and Andre Ramiro in the central roles."
"It is one of the great movies i have seen in the recent days, and i must add i am very lucky to see this movie.It is about the activities of the drug dealers in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and how the police react to this. It shows the corruption within the police and why a special squad called BOPE was formed for stopping the violence in slums. I was astonished to see the corruption in the police and cannot imagine a situation without the BOPE.The movie greatly portrays the activities of the BOPE which is highly strategical. I liked each and every frame of their activities especially the training of the new recruits, that shows why they are so tough.Storyline is a narrative type narrated by Capitão Nascimento(Wagner Moura) who is the captain of the BOPE and a very good fighter and seeks a replacement. Wagner Moura did well in this movie.I liked the portrayal of the story which starts from the middle, go to the start and move on to the end of the movie.One thing i cannot understand is that the BOPE just go and shoot or threaten to kill people and raid innocent peoples house without any law. They work independently, and it is portrayed in the movie that they can do whatever they want without any permission or laws. I don't think it is possible. But still i think we can justify their activities, because without such powers BOPE cannot fight against those heavily armed slums.The camera and lighting's are very good.It gives a real effect to the movie.There are a few shot from the sky showing the slums which is excellent.Anyway it is a must watch movie.You will surely enjoy this movie.If you have seen City Of God and liked it i am damn sure that you will really love this movie as i do.It is like City Of God taken from the other side(law enforcement side).You must really watch this movie, or else you are gonna miss something great."
"Tropa de Elite is a fascinating counterpoint to Fernando Meirelles' City of God. Written by the same screenwriter, the Oscar-nominated Bráulio Mantovani, this movie shows the seedy side of Rio de Janeiro from the cops' point of view, particularly BOPE, an elite squad created to intervene when regular cops can't cut it. Basically trained soldiers acting as policemen, they're methodical and ruthless, but apparently also the only ones really committed to cleaning up the streets. The rest of the police force are jut happy taking bribes and helping criminals whenever they can.The movie follows Captain Nascimento's search for a replacement. He's had too much, has a pregnant wife and the horrors of his work are making him crazy. Wagner Moura is a revelation here. The reach of his performance will probably be lost on non-Brazilian or non-Portuguese viewers who've never seen him on dreadful soap operas. One look at the hardened, melancholy, weary face of Nascimento and you'd never believe this actor plays romantic leads for a living. Nascimento is not a nice man, he doesn't like the choices he has to make to do his job.So he finds a way out on two new recruits, Neto and Matias, two disillusioned regular cops wishing to have a more active role in fighting crime. Matias is a brilliant young man, studying to become a lawyer, whereas the thick-headed Neto has more guts and skills with a rifle than most people. Seeing the corruption within the department, they're quickly seduced by BOPE.Although not as a graphic and technically impressive as City of God, this is still a pretty amazing movie. It's more conventional, more straightforward, but with a vision of Brazilian society as unflinching as Meirelles' masterpiece. The director, José Padilha, tackles touchy subjects here, from police corruption to police brutality to the role society has in funding drug business. It's an unpleasant movie, but most good movies tend to be."
"From October 2nd to October 6th 1997, Pope John Paul II visited Brazil for the fourth time. Since his first visit in 1980 the social inequality has grown exponentially and the safety conditions deteriorated. But as we all do, Rio de Janeiro tried to show itself in better light. Homeless families and children have been temporarily cleared off the streets and Pope's safety was entrusted to more than 20,000 detectives, military police officers and soldiers, amongst whom were the members of Batalhão de Operações Policiais Especiais (Special Policial Operations Battalion) better known as BOPE. BOPE is a special unit of military police concerned mainly with battle against organized crime and famous for its incorruptibility unlike the rest of the police.Nine years later, and just a few months before the new Pope's first visit to Brazil, sociologist Luiz Eduardo Soares and two BOPE officers, Major André Batista and Captain Rodrigo Pimentel, have written a semi-fictional book talking about preparations for Pope's 1997 visit and called ""Elite da Tropa"". In 2007 director José Padilha, with the help of screenwriter Bráulio Mantovani, adapted the book into a movie called ""Tropa de Elite"" (""Elite Squad""). It draw controversy for its portrayal of BOPE as a brutal and uncompromising force and police as being corrupted on every level.Movie is narrated by Captain Roberto Nascimento, a member of BOPE who must lead his men to clean the favelas (slums) before the arrival of the Pope. It's his last assignment before retiring so he must also find someone to replace him. Along Nascimento, we follow two candidates for his position, young police recruits André Matias and Neto Gouveia. While André is studying law, and believes in peaceful solutions and good police work, Neto is honest but short-tempered and rash. Discovering how corrupt the police force is, they decide to register for BOPE.Although the movie is narrated by a member of BOPE, it takes a fairly distant approach. It is so because Nascimento himself tries to quit BOPE. His wife is pregnant and he got sick of his work which is why he's looking for his replacement. The methods his team uses are troubling at least. They are ready to torture and kill anyone they assume might be connected with the criminals and show almost no compassion. The methods they use are problematic and discarded as savage and immoral by Matias's colleagues at the law school, whom Matias then accuses of being ignorant to true problems and theorizing and criticizing from their privileged positions without true knowledge of the situation. It is interesting because it gets you thinking. All of us criticize something from time to time without knowing a lot about the subject. We criticize politicians for how they run a country, football players for how they play, heck, I criticize movies although I've never learned how to direct or act, and don't really know how the whole movie-making process feels and works. Knowing theory is good, but it isn't enough. Sure BOPE's methods are morally wrong, but the situation isn't black and white. It never is.The way those problems and dilemmas are shown is great. Mantovani did a fantastic job with the screenplay, probably helped by the great source material. The story is simple yet effective. It makes us think and also gets us emotionally involved. The camera-work is superb. Scenes showing the moving of Nascimento's squad through favelas are exciting and suspenseful and the movie for most of the time makes you feel like you're watching a documentary. Padilha did a great work. The actors are also fantastic. Wagner Moura as Nascimento and André Ramiro as Matias did a great job showing us troubled characters, as did Caio Junqueira as resolute Neto and Fábio Lago as cruel leader of the gang, Baiano, to point out just a few.Rarely a movie functions on so many levels as is the case with ""Tropa de Elite"". It's a personal story, a great action movie, a display of the problems that social inequality creates, an introduction to a debate about moral issues and limits of law enforcement, and much more. I've watched it for four times now, and I can't wait to watch it again. You should do the same."
"If there hadn't been City of God, then Elite Squad might have made even more impact. But although it milks similar roots (the violence of Rio de Janeiro's poor areas), it at times feels as if it is doing just that  milking it  even if the details have been meticulously researched and re-created.Prior to the visit of the Pope, the Rio authorities try a clean-up operation so there is no danger to his holiness (who wants to stay among the poor). Ironically, the Pope's visit thus engenders a spate of violence as gangs battle with the elite 'BOPE' police squad. BOPE has additional problems with the regular police, who are endemically corrupt and keep the peace through a system of gentle bribery. Given that a policeman earns about the same as a bus conductor, the 'bribery' is arguably less awful (for the most part) than it sounds, especially when kept within decent levels.It should be added that the drug squads who run the slums not only police the slums (by and large) more effectively than the police do the regular areas, but are largely beneficent  for instance paying hospital bills or doing other kindnesses. They have only two rules  don't sell drugs on my patch and don't do anything to arouse police attention (such as mugging tourists in the slums). Many slums are therefore safer than the main tourist areas like Copacabana, and this is both from my own observation, visiting Brasil for many years, and from the accounts of people there. It is a two tiers society that, for the most part, live entirely separately. But, ""when honest cops go into the slums, bad sh*t usually happens."" (The main city, away from slums and tourist areas, is much like any other modern metropolis for safety, facilities, the arts and business.) It is perhaps no wonder that, however accurate the film is, it has aroused the ire of independent filmmakers in the famous carnaval city. As I sat in a restaurant on Copacabana beach, two independent filmmakers explained at length how they deplored the image that such films pumped out at the world (Elite Squad did rather well at the Berlin Festival). It is a far cry from the more balanced, but now dated, look of such films as Black Orpheus. As most people are unaware of the richness of Rio, it might be compared to making films exclusively about Bronx violence if no-one knew of the greatness of New York City.Further ironies go unmentioned. The 'drugs problem', seen by westerners as stemming from South America, is seen by Brasilians as an American one (caused by American user demand). In Rio, American guns are traded for Colombian drugs. Neither are of great interest to Brasilians. And although the country is predominantly Roman Catholic, the papal visit to the slums can also be seen as an attempt to make inroads on the (more) indigenous and non-proselytising religions like Candoble that survive in such areas. Operation Holiness is 'plain foolishness.' One policeman says he would rather use his own money to pay for a good room for the Pope in Copacabana than protect him in the badlands.One of the good moral points the film makes rather well is how rich kids who deal in a little weed are ignored. Whereas those in the slums are brutalised. The disparity is highlighted by a classroom discussion.Elite Squad is a gritty, realistic action-heavy fight between 'good guys' and 'bad guys'. A lot of ordinary people in both camps get murdered and tortured along the way. The problem with Elite Squad is not the authenticity of what it includes but the relevance of what it leaves out."
"A brutal, unwavering & violent dive into the criminal underworld existing within the slums of Rio de Janerio, Elite Squad is a semi-fictional account of Brazil's own SWAT team, known as BOPE, and while the film became a cultural phenomenon in its country during its time of release, I fail to see anything that's so impressive about it.Set in the late 1990s, Elite Squad (also known as Tropa de Elite) follows the leader of Rio de Janerio's Special Police Operations Squad who is looking for his replacement as he intends to retire from the field soon and take the job of training new recruits. But his final operation requires him to take down drug dealers & criminals in the slum area before Pope's arrival in Brazil.Co-written & directed by José Padilha, there isn't much wrong with the singular aspects here for the direction is pretty good, screenplay does put up some interesting characters on screen, and its raw handling of its subject matter does evoke a gritty feel but what the film lacks is a proper presentation for the whole picture has a messed-up structure which makes it very difficult to follow.Set pieces & locations do give this story the atmosphere required to set the desired mood, Cinematography encapsulates the film with a crude, unrefined layer but its poor execution of hand-held camera-work does hurt it at times. Editing is another major disappointment for the plot completely lacks a streamlined flow & is far more fragmented than required, and the only thing that leaves a mark is the strong performances by its cast.On an overall scale, Elite Squad could've been one of the most captivating examples of its genre but thanks to its lack of refinement, no sense of direction, messy plot & bewildering narration, it misses the mark by quite a distance. Every aspect does have a few things that are impressive, but it fails to seamlessly integrate into one engaging motion picture. Still for its unflinching portrait of crime, corruption & police brutality, Elite Squad is worth at least one shot."
"This is a complex film not in plot, but in the weave of the characters and how morality is completely blurred. I have watched over 100 films this year and this is in the top three I've stumbled across.The acting, cinematography, plot, characters and the way this unfolds, will be loved by any fans of the City of God. This is like a way way more realistic portrayal of why all this dreadful stuff keeps going on, seen from several sides of the conflict.The three main characters - Captain Niscamento of the Elite squad - paranoid, troubled, stressed but somehow holding it together. Andre Matias, would-be lawyer and member of the squad - who discovers that being a cop will cut him off from living normally. And Neto - hard man, yes sir, no sir tough lead in the squad, spilling lots of claret around the slums. The sets are amazing - there is a scene in the slums where abandoned houses cover the landscape and are used for a gun battle. The shells of the properties erupt like rotten teeth from the rubble and i've never seen anything like it. There are plenty more examples.This film is so well made it will appeal to many genre lovers. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
"Thought provoking, highly charged, and just about damn near pitch perfect, Elite Squad is a document about what goes on day in, day out in the ""war"" between the elite BOPE forces and the drug cartels, dealers,and dare I say, addicts within the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. BOPE are the elite, tactical unit of Rio's police department. Highly militaristic, highly trained, and highly duty bound, the BOPE share much in common with the most elite counter insurgency or counter terrorism special forces units in the world such as the US Navy SEALs, the British SAS or the German GSG9. But what separates BOPE from these units, is that BOPE is the police, not the military. And this raises all kinds of flags. You see, BOPE's ends may be just, but their means are absolutely ruthless. Throw your Miranda Rights out the window kids, they DO NOT exist in Brazil. BOPE will shoot first and NEVER ask questions. They will torture to get information and then swoop down like ninja packing state of the art firepower and overwhelm their enemies, the drug gangs of the Rio slums. And they will do so without any apparent oversight.Who do the BOPE commanders report to? We don't know. We see BOPE through the eyes of Captain Nascimento. The good captain believes that everything around not BOPE is utterly corrupt and beyond redemption. That includes other cops that are not BOPE, the gangs, the addicts, and the government. But what's interesting is that Nascimento wants out. He's seen enough. Apparently he's got too much blood on his hands. Or maybe its the fact that his wife is pregnant with their first child, a son. Whatever the reason, Nascimento is deeply troubled as he goes into battle fighting back the shakes, fighting back what is apparently PTSD. He can't bring himself to tell the psychiatrist that he's seeing what's really troubling him. Nascimento though figures he'll have to get himself a replacement so he can get transferred out of front line duty. Well, his replacement candidates are a couple of young rookies from the local PD, Neto and Matias. Both are eager and have not yet been tainted by the lure of corruption in the service. The film paints a portrait of a police force where cops screw each other over for bribes and territory all the while consorting with the drug gangs (the very enemy of the BOPE) and shaking down the citizenry for protection money. Neto and Matias want to do the right thing and be model police officers but that isn't going to happen unless they get away from the cops around them. So Nascimento, after rescuing them from a shoot out between the cops and gangs (and other cops), selects them for BOPE training. Both go through the HELL of training and these sequences rival what you've seen on the Discovery Channel of soldiers trying to make elite military units like the SEALs. Matias is also trying to get his law degree and make something of himself outside the police force. He falls in with the wrong crowd though--a bunch of rich college kids who use drugs and consort with the gangs and their bosses. You know this is going to have a bad ending. And it does. But not in the way you expect.The telling thing here is that Matias' friends are all part of the problem. They hate the cops and the BOPE especially but they are all breaking the law one way or another and supporting the very dilemma that plagues Brazil and every other country--illicit drugs. Yet, they don't think twice about the corruption around them or the cops who try to keep the city safe. It's a dangerous combination. They need the police and the government to ultimately keep their lifestyles going. Crazy, isn't it. That's what's so fantastic about this film. This isn't a Hollywood cops and robbers blockbuster or a buddy cop movie. This is a police procedural which shows you how things happen in the real world, for better or for worse. Definitely, for the worse. BOPE is nothing more than a death squad. Nascimento is a father figure to his sons, Matias and Neto, pointing them in the right direction to become like the predator he is. Nascimento believes in the law more than anything. He's moral and upright, yet at what cost? Certainly he is no hero gunning down teenagers and torturing women all in the name of justice. He's a wolf, like the other BOPE soldiers, and everyone else are sheep. The wolves hunt and kill with impunity. That's what they do. I was thinking about Mamoru Oshii's award winning anime, Jin-Roh, while I was watching Elite Squad. Oshii's Kerberos Panzer Cops are like the BOPE, elite law enforcement officers who go around handing out justice at all costs. But Oshii pointed out that once a man becomes a wolf what becomes of his humanity? He sheds it of course,like hair. The BOPE are a dehumanizing death machine when its all said and done blowing away bad guys in a broken, busted world. And that isn't something you're comfortable with as you watch this film."
"This movie is not only a story about police and favelas, it's a story about being interested and not being interested in what is going on around people or just behind the hill and after the tunnel (Rio).I guess that we, worldwide watchers of this movie, are not able to see the real sociological impact, this movie made in Brazil. Last night in Belgrade, Fernanda Machado (Marian) said that the movie started a huge discussion which is still running. And I think that this was the major idea of the book writer from the very beginning.So, the point is not if we like the acting or how Rio looks like. The point is if this movie helped the noise made with publishing this book. I'm always for socially active movies."
"BOPE - Fighting fire with fire. Watch Wagner Moura put in a chillingly intense performance as Captain Nascimento, the captain of BOPE whose under a massive amount of pressure. Caio Junqueira (Neto) and André Ramiro (Matias) are also fantastic as well as Fernanda Machado (Maria), whose extremely easy on the eye with her natural Latino beauty. The cinematography and screenplay is fantastic. This movie is a must see for pretty much anyone (unless you only like comedies or something).Some people (human rights activists and critics mostly) have attacked the film for not portraying the truth about BOPE, and for glorifying violence and ""fascism"", but I don't think that is the message here. First of all it works both ways; the higher society crowd are portrayed far more angelic and innocent than they really are. The upper society brats do not just use marijuana as seen in this movie, they abuse cocaine and heroin as well, and some of them are even worse and more twisted than the drug dealers themselves. But this isn't the point, so there was no need to put it in.I also loved how this movie does not take the easy way by showing monstrous acts from the villains such as rape or senseless random murder in order to make the ""good guys"" look better or justify reprisal. There are no good guys in this movie, only the law and the criminals, and even then they both get mixed up a lot. Things always happen for a reason. That's what sets ""Tropa de Elite"" from the rest, especially that MTV movie S.W.A.T. although it would be unfair to compare directly as they are of different genre imo. Tropa de Elite has its ""MTV"" moments but IMO it doesn't glorify it at all, it is merely used to keep you interested so it doesn't pan out like a documentary.On a final note, thank you José Padilha for delivering this fantastic movie! It certainly left a deep impression on me, as well as a kind of respect for BOPE, an understanding kind of respect and not just for its violence or heavy handed measures."
"Es algo que siempre me molesta. ¿Es necesario mover tanto la cámara? No digo que no se pueda hacer cámara en mano, ¿pero tan exageradamente rápido? Es como una carrera por meter más planos y más veloces cada vez. No se consigue así el ritmo, pero parece que está de moda y hasta que no se pase, habrá que aguantarloLa película en general la ves y vale, te la crees, pues sí. Pero, no sé, no da para más. No es que me interese mucho.Hay ratos que me sobran, lo cual la hacen larga. Tiene demasiada voz en off. No consigo entrar cuando me cuenta una voz en off en vez de la película.Los actores, no sé si serán todos profesionales, pero si te los crees, aunque no creo que los malos, no sean más malos en la realidad.La iluminación no es mala, pero tendría que ser mejor. Meterte más de lleno.El director, a mí no me gusta. Hay veces que no veo lo que pasa, por su cámara. No por moverla más rápido se da más ritmo. No consigue atraparme y me sobra película.A ver como es la segunda parte, pero me temo que será peor.
It's something that always bothers me. Is it necessary to move the camera so much? I'm not saying that you can not make camera in hand, but so overly fast? It's like a race to get more planes and faster each time. The rhythm is not achieved in this way, but it seems that it is fashionable and until it is over, it will have to be enduredThe film in general you see it and it's okay, you believe it, so yes. But, I do not know, it does not give for more. It's not that I'm very interested.There are moments that I have left over, which make it long.It has too much voice in off. I can not get in when he tells me a voiceover instead of the movie.The actors, I do not know if they will all be professionals, but if you believe them, although I do not believe that the bad guys are not worse in reality.Lighting is not bad, but it should be better. Get in more fully.The director, I do not like it. Sometimes I do not see what happens, because of his camera. Not by moving it faster is given more rhythm. He can not catch me and I have a movie left over.Let's see how the second part is, but I'm afraid it will be worse."
"When rating or reviewing an American movie, the process is simple: Decide how much you liked the movie in a scale of 1 to 10. Usually this pertains to how much you enjoyed the story, or the style of filmmaking, or the actors. Most American movies are made for mass consumption.On these terms, ""Elite Squad"" succeeds because it's a well-told, fast-paced story, told with the simplistic, high-on-adrenaline documentary style of filmmaking. There are a few good shots, but mostly the director just cares about getting in the face of the viewer, and quickening their pulse. For the most part, he succeeds.But, this being Brazil, we must also look at the movie from another perspective: What is it trying to say? For certain, you can just ignore the politics of the film and focus on the gun battles, but there are long scenes of cops with their wives and girlfriends, or going through training, which for the ""Squad"" of the title, is really more like boot-camp.I don't live in Brazil, I have never been to Brazil, but from my perspective the politics behind the film are shockingly naive. The characters claim to be fighting this great evil, slowly caving under the pressure of being the best cops in their nation, surrounded by corruption and dishonesty on all sides. And at the same time, they routinely lump in hard drug users, pimps, pot-smokers, and abortionists in the exact same category, while ignoring blackmail, bribery, and having beers after work. The film is not trying to say something about these cops-- it agrees with them, the protagonist spending the entire film training possible replacements, speaking passionately about the top two candidates via voice-over narration, as he hopes and prays the new squad leader will run the squad in exactly the same way as it was before.If Brazil is this conservative from top to bottom, no wonder it's falling apart. ""City of God"" made us look at the favelas, the type of life their residents live in every day, and how hard it is to escape. It made us feel, and made us sympathize. In ""Elite Squad,"" there is not a single redeeming character, and every male in it destroys countless others for his own selfish needs... while each and every woman and child is just there to get in the way, or else serve as punching bags.The criminals are psychotic, the cops equally so, with innocent bystanders caught up either in the middle, or ignoring things from the sidelines. If director Jose Padilha is trying to tell us anything, it's ""Brazil is an awful place, populated by awful people."" I'm sure that's not true. But as long as the body count keeps stacking up, why would the audience care?Filmmaking: 8/10 (its current IMDb average). Politically, 4/10. Bill O'Reilly would love this movie, because its message is even more idiotic than any movie Michael Bay ever made: ""If we can only arrest or kill every pimp, every pot-smoker, every prostitute and every person who has an abortion, the country will be great again."" Not only is that an impossible goal, it's the statement of an insane person. Compared to this, ""Transformers"" is positively intellectual."
"This movie is about pair of Brazilian police rookies who join an elite team (similar to our SWAT teams) called BOPE. The training is so rigorous that only a handful complete it. BOPE officers go into the worst slums in Rio de Janeiro to arrest drug dealers and gang members. They are, as the narrator explains, a very different breed from the regular police.Rio's police force is rife with corruption and incompetence; BOPE's job is to fix out-of-control situations that the other cops have messed up. BOPE is judge, jury, and executioner. Suspects don't have the rights and protections that they do in the US.The narrative style and direction strongly resemble the films of Martin Scorcese (Mean Streets, Goodfellas). The pacing is perfect. You feel like you're right there in the slums of Rio, watching the action. I guarantee that no one will be bored for one minute. Anyone who likes The French Connection, Maria Full of Grace, Traffic, or New Jack City should definitely see this. It will be ranked among the best movies of this genre."
"This movie is ultra-violent, fast paced and has a plot that is all over the place (apparently, with some people saying that it is hard to follow). But that is the point (why else would the director bother to make it the way he did?), it is supposed to be frenetic (explained a bit more later in my review) and very, very unsettling to watch when it gets violent, although I wouldn't say that the movie is sadistic because the movie does not make the violence entertaining the same way ""Kill Bill"" (good movie by the way) does. Maybe you can laugh a little by the absurdity of the violence, but that might mean that you're not really well mentally (note that I wrote might). I can see why people can get turned off by the violence, but that's the point. It is supposed to be uncomfortable.As far as the pacing goes, it is energetic and I think that it was made that way so we can feel as confused or as lost as the characters in the movie. Also the characters are more gray (more non-descript) compared to what we would get from mainstream movies to make them more human, thus making them seem more lost. If the movie had more stereo-typical characters (the good versus evil, black and white etc.)the movie would have had less impact. If you ask me. Makes it a bit harder to relate to them though, meaning that it is harder to root for them. But then again, are there people to root for in this world when it comes to killing people? For me it just seems that the people who try to stop violence with violence breeds violence. Making things worse.Also it does have a strong message. I find it a bit hard to understand that some people said that this movie is a mindless action movie with no message. But the message is: When dealing with the corrupt, there are pretty big chances to get corrupted yourself. Or more philosophically written: If society is corrupt, then you are also corrupt because you are society.Anyway, if you read this far you've noticed that I gave the movie 10/10. I gave it 10/10 not because of how entertaining it was (it really is not), but for the sheer power of the movie. It left me in shock and in awe. The movie has substance and a strong plot, but it is a bit hard to swallow (for some, very hard to swallow). Strong movie.If I made some grammatical mistakes, my excuse is that English is not my mother tongue."
"Although I enjoyed this film very much, I can understand why foreign viewers are dismissing it as a piece of cheap gratuity.I have to say this is not a film meant to be seen outside. It was originally made (and sometimes ""enhanced"") as bleak critic of current state of affairs in Brazil, more specifically in Rio de Janeiro.The city, once Brazil's best feature, has now become some kind of no man's land, with social distortions that you would seen only the worst places of earth. To acknowledge the fact, it takes more than ""Cidade de Deus"" - a flick that shows violence the way we want to see, as a social cause of poverty, as closed question. But that's not all of it.Elite Squad (""Tropa de Elite"") made its point, when its author accurately detected that the violent law enforcement agents, the messed up soldiers of the film, are only translating what a major parcel of the population desires. And deconstructing this rationale have put in motion one of the most passionate social debate that fiction work ever inspired in Brazil's cultural scenario.But that's it. It's not a cultural universal. It's characters are not made to be believable for other audiences than its aimed audience. The possibly loopholes it contains are there because, for the most of it, a Brazilian spectator won't need further information. He or she knows by heart what they are seeing because that is part of their daily newspaper pages.What's portrayed on the screen - without subtle innuendos or softened undertones - it is not what it seems at first glance, a ""caricature"" of the reality. It's the reality filtered to the middle through the TV news, or the unfiltered reality on the streets. Most of the living characters of the film came to say about it that it is indeed a accurate portrayal. And that's scary.Not the violence in the film scares us, but the fact that a nation became a caricature of itself.The director could not capture more accurately the national sentiment - a mixed of confused feelings towards the poor that urges a undeclared class war. The director takes on the duty to reveal the ugly face of violence - the one that is hidden inside of each inhabitant, from higher classes to the lowest - their desire for a punitive state, their acceptance of violence if it to serve the purpose of ""break"" the criminal homogeneity - and it's comprehensibly unbelievable by the foreign eye that Brazil's, as a nation, has come to this.The very matter-of-factly way that the director chooses to tells the history is something awfully engaging for those who live or are in touch with the facts portrayed in the screen. This ""in-your-face"" approach will be only fully understood by intended audience.By no means this is a universal flick, but - quite contrarily - is particular and regional as it can be: it doesn't explain its historic context, uses fast-paced slang-dialog, subtly uses social stereotypes that are only common consensus considering Brazil's social archetype.It only makes matter worse that the final cut was released with a change of tone of the narrator, being he the only guide through the whole mess, I lowered my rate of the film because of that. The director in the last minute tried to made the film more palatable for the general audience and weakened a, otherwise, very fine work."
"As most of the people voting and writing reviews here, I have seen a great number of movies from different genres and countries (of course, for better or worse, the American films are dominating). So, following the positive comments, I decided to watch this movie despite the fact that I live in a very remote country (Bulgaria) from Brazil and I am not very familiar with the problems taking place there.Well, I can say, the movie is EXCELLENT. and not only in the more specific and technical aspects of a movie (screenplay, acting, directing, storytelling etc.) but also it looks very real and plausible. It makes you feel as an accidental witness and observer of what is wrong in the thorough system of Brazil. It is like you are watching a live footage and everything that is happening on screen is actually happening it is real. Another great key point that adds to this feeling is the way that the actors are presented, the way they act, and the great way they are developed. None of the characters looks as a specially selected nice-looking actor with tones of make-up to make him look authentic. They all look like real people, they are believable and interesting. Almost any of the main characters goes through a development through storyline which is another sign of a high-quality movie. The action sequences are also very well-crafted and most of all believable. The way that the Elite Squad operates looks very original and interesting. To summarize, ""Elite Squad"" is a very interesting, dynamic and though-provoking movie. In my opinion, its only weak point is the little bit confused storytelling."
"Another movie about the external world of organized inadequacies, this one set in Brazil and also about deep-rooted suffering in the cogs that give rise to that world. We race through, seeing with a certain narrative eye that tries to make sense, so let's see a few observations made by that eye.It lambasts several worlds. The world of corrupt cops who take bribes to do their job and still more bribes to look the other way, seen as ignorant bureaucrats or yet another gang. The world of privileged university kids who like to harp on about power structures but become unwitting cogs in the chain of abuse when they go to the barrio to score drugs for their socially conscious lifestyle. The world of drugs, of course, with petty chieftains ruling their own tribes of hapless kids.It's an angry film; angry at what it sees as the competing selfishness of different tribes only looking to please a narrow self interest. It begins with two rookie cops who it presents as extraordinarily competent and who just want to do work that untangles knots, but become stifled by bureaucracy and ignorance. They finally enlist in the special ops squad to come out on the other end as merciless rambos as the only way to get something done; direct action the only way to cut through the ambiguity and indifference.It doesn't shy away from showing horrible police brutality and not the Dirty Harry cartoon. Kids are beaten, suffocated with plastic bags, and almost raped with a wooden broom to spill the beans. The point here is that it could have airbrushed this view but didn't and chose instead to confront the reality. Had it come out in the US, it would have been the most controversial films that year.But just as we think that in their frantic chase to restore order they end up brutalizing an innocent kid, torture leads them to the right place. In the end this eye comes with its own blindness. It's all a bit of a mess apart from this like we're seeing parts of different episodes of a season of crime TV."
"If Bus 174 was a documentary on the States' corruption of the people, then Tropa de Elite's is the story of the States' corruption of the police. Having seen Elite Squad-2 first, (due to its' American availability) I found this making more of a political statement than if I had to simply focus on the brutality of the action, production and lack of character development, which don't change that much, only develop into the obvious. Yes, Wagner Moura cracks a bit before settling down, but only returns to his action hero status. The ending is so abrupt that it mirrors horror films in its' inability to provide any scenes of epilogue, which might have provided commentary instead of endless killing.That being said, it is an important movie that gives you plenty to care about. Our Captain Nacimento is our man in the middle and easy to relate into. The tourist attraction of Rio de Janeiro is hidden from accessibility here. There is no vacation from the war.So grateful that José Padilha and Wagner Moura made the third movie and developed Captain Nacimento so the story of the States' political corruption could be literally woven and then exposed. Not a real story? Try telling that to the workers in the favellas!"
"'Elite Squad' always seems to be compared to or mentioned in the same breath as 'City of God', but they are at heart very different movies, with 'Elite Squad', despite the merits of the other is the more challenging and gripping feature. The Brazilian police force due to their brutal treatment of slum dwellers and rampant corruption have a terrible reputation and Elite Squad makes no attempt to hide this. What it does do is show the reasons why the low paid regular policeman will find life quieter and more profitable if he colludes with the criminals and dealers. Then again, the main character of the movie Captain Nascimento is not regular police - he is part of the military style Elite Squad BOPE who are used in the most dangerous situations and has more contempt for the corrupt regulars than the armed drug dealers he has to fight. At the other end of the moral scale is Fabio, who the two rookie policemen Neto & Matias are initially placed under. Fabio's main concern is making as much money as he can from various rackets and he's exasperated when he discovers his new officers actually want to fight crime. While Neto is hot headed and eager to use violence, Matias is calm & intelligent and has the wish to become a lawyer. It is at law school where he keeps company with a group of rich 'playboys', but he does not reveal he is a policeman and turns a blind eye to their copious drug intake, something that has tragic consequences later in the movie. Despite being a huge hit in Brazil, many critics in the USA & Britain slammed the film for its perceived glorification of police brutality. But was the true reason for their antipathy to the movie the fact Elite Squad paints an unflattering image of the upper and middle classes? In 'City of God', the problems resulting from the drug trade are depicted as only affecting the slum dwellers. The middle class characters appear as kind and helpful and at the conclusion of the movie, the main character Rocket announces that he has become one of them. In 'Elite Squad', the upper classes are depicted as idle hypocrites who pour scorn on a police force that isolates them from the violence of the slums and the main consumers of drugs coming out of from there. More anger seems to directed at them by the writers of the movie than either the dealers or the corrupt police. Considering the movie was destined to play to art-house audiences outside Brazil, this was a brave stance to take. As Nascimento says during the movie commentary 'I often ask myself how many kids we lose to the drug business just so rich playboys can light up a joint'. 'Elite Squad' is a definite must see movie, but avoid the dubbed version at all costs."
"Tropa de Elite plays out like a fascist recruitment video.My main problem with this film comes from its exploitation of a real world problem, and creating a loud, violent action movie, and welding it to a pro-authority message.The film is shot in a manner similar to other recent Brazilian crime fair, but instead of the bursting intensity of City of God, the directors shoot in drab colours, with a drab lead, expounding a far from subtle, and rather sinister, social message.Although its quick, chopping editing should suggest urgency, we are left with a barely passable story of characters strewn together, in a bumbling action thriller."
"This is one of the best movies I've seen in awhile, right up there with City of God and Pulp fiction type of good. Of course this movie is not for everyone as it is a violent movie, and it does have some scenes that can be construed as controversial and brutal, though I personally did not see anything that is any more brutal than what we see in a lot of action movies nowadays. If you don't mind the violence (and you should know that the movie is violent based on its rating), then I cannot recommend this movie enough.I would say overall the movie has a great story line and acting and Jose Padilha again does an awesome job at directing after his great work with Bus 174."
"Without a doubt, one of the best movies that came out in the past years. It just is amazing the reality we face throughout the movie, the bitter realization of the lives of everyone involved : the people on the 'favelas', the trafficants, the drug-using middle class, the dirty cops, the honest cops, and mostly, BOPE.""Tropas de Elite"", or ""Elite Squad"" is the story of Capitão Nascimento - a BOPE Captain decided on leaving the Brigade after his wife got pregnant, but before he can do so, he needs to find a replacement, someone that can manage and cope with the responsibility and pressure of being a BOPE Captain. Two ""rookies"" pop up, sharing his desire to do good, and the will to really annihilate the drug dealers from the favelas, Matias is intelligent\clever but lacks the 'strength' to deal with those issues, and Neto is just the opposite : strong and decided, but lacking the sense and intelligence to cope with the situations. It all converges on the Pope's visit to Rio de Janeiro, and his decision to stay on a favela.No sugarcoating, no comic relief, no misleading facts, just the cold hard story, and all the thrills it brings along. The BOPE incursions through the favelas on the movie are the most realistic and nerve wrecking images i've got to see in a movie on a long time. It's also very thought-provoking due to the way we're shown the corruption of the system (in Brazil as it is on several other countries...), and the difficulties honest people (police in this case) have just with dealing with their own problems and situations.A MUST SEE for everyone that's into good movies. Shocking, thrilling, amazing."
"OK well this doesn't try to be a sequel to city of god and it does not try to resemble city of god in any way. Its set in Rio and thats it.This is about the Police the corruption the drugs and the dealers, it vaguely touches on the middle classes. There is no good guys and no bad guys, Nor right or wrong, drugs are not the problem and people taking them are not the problem. Its what surrounds the taking of drugs that is the problem. Greed Money Power all follow in the drugs footsteps as they follow in other criminal activities. The Film is not as visually stunning as say city of god but the cinematography is still rather good. The story is well paced and always moving and the acting is good although its harder for me to tell when i do not speak the same language. The script and direction was excellent so i'm sure any actor would have looked good but this wasn't about grand performances this was about the nitty gritty. I don't know how much of what is saw is the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth but i do know that the issues covered are very true for people in certain parts of Rio. Can I say that Naciamento is a Fascist at heart or is he a product of his environment. I think the Film explains this on the whole when describing what he needs as a replacement. Which was another great thing about the film, the narrative was telling the story but without being condescending to the audience. It was giving you all the information you needed to know without telling you the whole story. A lot of this film is about reading between the lines but you can also just watch it as an action flick with plenty of violence (I am sure this is what 12 yr old boys would see), It even has quite a few MTV moments which I am sure would please the masses (not that i am sure if this film will ever reach the masses). Either way the execution was good and while not perfect it was still the best film I have seen this year. While I did find that certain methods in the film were a little gratuitous towards the violence element. I am sure this is the sort of film that can entertain you while at the same time raises questions and also emotions from disbelief to anger to fear to sadness e.t.c. Very Good and definitely not one to miss."
"Probably the best film to come out of Brazil since City of God, and certainly the most intelligent.I left the cinema depressed, stirred and buzzed. As a film, it is first class. The editing, script, cinematography are first class, but what stands out, is staggeringly impartial stance it adopts. Its realism and honesty about one of the most hopeless tragedies on earth is extraordinary.The nightmarish ""Catch 22"" Rio DE Janeiro is plagued by has never been so well exposed. The police are corrupt! They have little choice. The drug dealers are the police in the favelas. Of course since the police don't police them. The innocents suffer. As always. BOPE (Elite wing of the police) have to use horrible tactics to preserve the status quo. What else can they do.See this film at all cost. If you love Brazil, it is a must, but even if you love great movies, see it too."
"This movie shows police officers in Rio de Janeiro who, even making little money and been poorly equipped, choose to risk their lives in the war against drug traffic, instead of become corrupted or stay away from problems, like many others. The movie shows the points of view of these police officers about the problem of violence. IT IS A PERFECT INSIDE OF THEIR MIND. The problem of the violence is show by the perspective of Capitan Nascimento, how is the narrator of the movie. Some people may complain of the single point of view, but in my opinion that was the objective of the movie: show the problem by the eyes of these men. This is why I have given a 10 to this movie. If the scenes of torture don't look like some thing too bad, it is because that's the the way they see it.The plot is also very good. Nascimento is the capitan of BOPE, a special force in the police. Close the become a father, Nascimento is looking for someone to take his place. Two friends show as possible choice, both have shown to be honest, willing to change things for better and courage, but for Capitan Nascimento that's not enough. The movie show the transformation in the personality of these two young man while working in the police, until they become what Nascimento expect. Beside good action, the movie have some drama showing a little of personal life problem of BOPE policemen caused by their job.A MUST SEE MOVIE."
It's 1997 Rio de Janeiro. Neto and Matias fire on a crowd of partying criminals. They are police disillusioned with the corruption. Captain Nascimento from the elite BOPE (Special Police Operation Battalion) lead his squad into battle. The movie goes back six months earlier. Neto and Matias are new recruits. The Pope is coming to Rio and BOPE has to clean up the slums.I got really annoyed at the non-stop narration with the start of the movie. I also wish the actors playing Neto and Matias are more charismatic. The story is told in a disjointed fashion. There is an ultra-realism about the locations and the people. It is a violent reaction to the crime-ridden slums.
"This Brazilian masterpiece, based on the book Elite da Tropa from several Brazilian authors, presents us a Brazilian social system and the special police of the federal state of Rio de Janeiro through the eyes of the main character and narrator, Captain Nascimento. The first part of the film is focused on the presentation of the famous system in which moral boundaries between drug gangs and local police generally don't exist. The police is extremely corrupt, inefficient, and deeply rooted in the criminal system at all levels, particularly in the poorest parts of the country, the favelas. We are introduced to the system through the eyes of two young and honest police officers, Matias and Neto who quickly come into conflict with a corrupt police officers. After that they decide to apply for a special police, BOPE, under the authority of captain Nascimento who is in the process of seeking his replacement because his personal life is suffering. Meanwhile BOPE are on a special mission of cleaning favelas because of arrival of the Pope who insists on residing in their vicinity. Almost every aspect of this film is flawless. The acting is perfect, while documentary directing fits the story perfectly and looks incredibly realistic. Visual impression deserves admiration because of the relative low budget of only 4 million dollars, which, fortunately, has conditioned shooting on real locations in Rio de Janeiro. Excellent soundtrack is also one thing that needs to be singled out. Rap das Armas stays in your ears for weeks after the movie. On first viewing it could be difficult to understand complete story, especially because of huge number of characters from what majority is transient, but non of them are unneeded. Second viewing definitely ensures complete pleasure in superb cinematography but also a creeps because of the reality of system from which most of us are perhaps far away, but it is very much real. Because of the better effect on story, special police is portrayed as completely pure and invincible what is of course far from the truth. However, activities and training of BOPE is accurately shown. Black uniforms, skulls, cruel training, methods of cleaning the favelas and the fear that they inspire are reality that is perfect for the big screen."
"I really enjoyed the film. The hand-held cameras gave a documentary feel to action scenes (as they should have), the characters were well developed in my opinion, and the acting was actually very good. I was not familiar with the actors involved (which usually helps me to appreciate a story), but there were strong performances even among smaller peripheral roles.The narration was not overdone; it complemented rather than dominated the film.The street scenes were edited nicely; I enjoyed the feel and flow of the shots.The violence was very realistic so be prepared for a slight shock. (I jumped during one scene - something that hasn't happened to me in many years!)"
"I just completely disliked this movie, despite of all the success it has had here in Brazil. I thought it a tendentious, conservative and Fascist screenplay. I must say that I don't do drugs, even so I don't agree with the movie's point of view. I think that it makes apology for violence, as if it were the only way to fight the traffic. And also put the blame on the drug consumers, saying that traffic only exists because they pay for it. But the movie simply doesn't discuss all the angles of the problem. Drug consumption always existed before traffic; the traffic only began because of the prohibition. Therefore, the consumption, actually, is not the real cause, since it came before. And they just don't bring up to discussion the possibility of all that terrible violence caused by the traffic, and showed in the movie, could be avoided or finished if the State legalized the use of drugs. I argue this prohibition, which started long time ago for economic reasons and purposes, is nonsense nowadays, and very hypocrite, since everybody knows that alcohol, for example, changes the mental alert state of one's mind much more than marijuana, and nicotine from cigarettes has more power to let someone addicted than most of illegal drugs, however they both are legal ones. The movie seems like an institutional film for BOPE. The main character's conflict is not plausible, and he seems more like a HQ superhero, who I didn't know whether scared me more than the bandits or not."
"Forget about the action movies that you're used to. This is real life action and as a Rio De Janeiro citizen, I can say that this movie is a sad, but true history. Exactly as told on this movie. This is just a glimpse of how hard the police duties can be on a city with a strong drug underworld. You'll see honest hard working officers trying to survive in the middle of the corrupted cops, drug dealers and politics. This film also shows when their work start to compromise their healths and their relationship with their families. Go and watch it and you'll see how their work is hard and how hard is to work with honor and honesty. A must see movie!"
"An elite police squad tackles drug gangs in Rio De Janeiro by shooting first and asking questions later. Making his first non-documentary feature, Padilha appears to be in over his head. He comes from the shaky camera school of directing, a school that should lose its accreditation. To simulate urgency, the hand-held camera is continually moving and there is rapid cutting. Instead of urgency or excitement, it creates confusion and nausea. Although a couple of the writers worked on the excellent ""City of God,"" the script for this one is atrocious. Given the bad script, ugly characters, poor acting, and terrible direction, this is basically unwatchable."
"This movie does not fulfill one's expectations...It has not nearly the same verve and pulse and artistic assets of ""Cidade de Deus"". It presumes that the violence in Rio has to be crushed with yet more violence. And the spectator all around Brazil bought this erroneous idea. This is a bad quality copy of a great book, called 'Elite da Tropa'. What the movie ""accidentally"" forget to mention is the fact that, nowadays, the individual on which Nascimento's character was based on is facing charges in Rio de Janeiro's Corregedoria da Polícia, the institution that deals with policemen that have broken the law. The allegations against him are not little: he have presumably facilitated and/or lend the 'caveirão' (bulletproof terrestrial vehicle, much like an armored cargo van) to drug dealers. The movie would be harmless, given the fact that is a mediocre movie; in terms of cinema, i'd give it a 5. Would be harmless, though. Because it has caused a huge hoopla amongst middle-class viewers in Brazil, that identify themselves with Nascimento, wishing they could, too, kill some 'favela' people.This movie is full of prejudice and bad, wrongful ideasOne thought, four words: DON'T GO SEE IT. A total waste of money and time."
"Another great Brazilian movie, no questions asks. Wagner Moura deserved an Oscar nomination, no kidding. There's just a few actors who can be the Good/Bad guy that Nascimento is. It's interesting to see how the Brazilian cinema grow up like this way in so little time...the opposite happens to Hollywood at the same way. Take this movie and 10.000 B.C for example : while the American movie is a waste of time and money that cost millions only on special effects, Elite Squad have even more good moments than City of God, two awesome movies made with even half of the cost of 10.000 B.C. It seems like Hollywood can't make great screenplays anymore, and a great screenplay is the base to made great movies. Maybe it's time to the whole world asks where the new Hollywood is.And i think that's is here, on Brazil. Watch this movie and think about it.10/10, deserved"
"""Elite Squad"" is one of my favourite movies of all time. I saw it for the first time a couple of years ago and yesterday I rewatched it. And I back then I liked it a lot, this time, I loved it. Its a rough and realist depiction of the inner Rio de Janeiro, where cops and drug dealers take part on a never-ending war for the favela's dominance. Within the law enforcers side we are presented to three major characters - Captain Nascimento (played by Wagner Moura, the best Brazilian actor from my point of view), and the both aspirants to be cops Neto and Matias. Nascimento is the main character of the two movies and he couldn't be played by a better actor. Moura delivers a performance of a troubled anti-hero, who wants to retire from BOPE (Brazil's special law enforcers) to spend more time with his wife and his future son. Moura is so believable and real that we all tend to love him, despite some of the dubious actions he performs throughout the story. He's a conflicted man, who just leaves when he feels his duty is fulfilled. ""A given mission, is an accomplished one"". Neto (played by Caio Junqueira) and Matias (played by André Ramiro) are also deeply explored on the plot, with the first being a younger version of Nascimento, reckless and motivated by his sense of justice and duty, while Matias is a young man split between two worlds - the one of the law enforcers and the one of the drug dealers. The directing of José Padilha really leveled the movie up. The sense of tension and pressure is present in the way he shoots the scenes, with the use of over the shoulder angles and a bit of shaky cam on some chases. The firefights are perfectly shot and Rio is showed at its best and worst. The film was produced by the Weinstein brothers which solely gives it distinction amongst other productions.A must-watch."
"This movie told about elite squads of police officers, BOPE as like as SWAT in America perhaps. BOPE are the police officers who can not be bribed by the criminals or drug dealers. They are police officers who frighten criminals or drug dealers . In this movie, we can see the ""real life"" of criminals in Brazil, who can bring guns anywhere and anytime. Many police officers can be bribed easily by drug dealers. Nascimento hated criminals and he wanted to eliminate them by joining BOPE. But he must resign from BOPE because ""big trouble"" in his family so he must choose his successor between Neto or Matias. This movie is very interesting. it's worthy to watch this movie"
""" Elite Squad"", is a powerful and controversial crime drama from Brasil. The immense poverty, corruption on every level and every segment of society,hopelessness of the impoverished in the slums of Rio. This violent and unflinching portrayal of the contemporary Brasil, leaves no prisoners and stirs strong feelings. Some of the critics abhor the ""fascist and right-wing politics"" of the director. I couldn't disagree more. As an unapologetic liberal. I am sensitive to populist and extremist garbage. This movie is not that. Quite the opposite. It is an honest and uncompromising look at the consequences of the corrupt political system. People without hope do desperate things.Lets avoid that path while we still have a fighting chance."
"If you liked ""Cidade de Deus"" (City of God) and other mainstream Braziliam movies, You'll enjoy this one! If you didn't liked, you'll also appreciate this piece of work!! Excellent movie! It shows the Brazilian Swat working in their own way to get the bad people out of business ;) Rio de Janeiro is a beautiful city, of course it has several problems, public security is very know problem, specially in ""Favelas"", where poor people live with drug dealers and regular citizens, all together, living in community. Police are afraid of enter there, but the ""swat"" is very well trained to do the job. Recommended for adults only!"
Tropa de Elite (2007) is an intense film that delves deep into who the BOPE (Batalhão de Operações Policiais Especiais) are and how it change you as a person. José Padilha directs the film with a continuous energy including some highly memorable police raid scenes. Wagner Moura is just fantastic; he displays the perfect balance of being evil and sympathetic. Certainly a role that prepared him for Pablo Escobar less than a decade later. Great film overall!
"A swift action-packed movie. Per se, it's has clichéd plot which also isn't very informative but the narrative is focused around the B.O.P.E squad member's life given the unfathomable corruption and danger of armed thugs looming. The training for B.O.P.E is a thrilling part for the naive civilians like me. None of the actors have aplenty footage and none of the characters are memorable but the whole movie would, somehow, remain holed up in your memory. One-time watch but recommended."

""Tropa de Elite"", the purest and crude record of Brazilian society, hypocrisy, profit, partiality and innocence, where policemen mistreat ""innocents"" to arrest bandits, and rich people finance crime and indirectly kill police with a pacifist speech. A script that talks about traffic, crime and favela by a different angle, the angle of the police, more specifically the BOPE, a special regiment of the military police, who tells us the story is Captain Nascimento, who mixes with the story of Mathias and Neto, young honest police officers who seek to fight organized crime, the elite troop script is accurate, but not perfect, it has many parallel plots that end up not being deepened, but it has a great construction of characters besides being brutally honest , even sometimes abusing scenes and phrases of effect - which eventually made the movie explode on its release. The morale of ""Elite Troop"" is that we are all wrong, there is no cure or a solution, no matter the side, any action taken ends up being harmful to someone, and often, to someone you want to help, before exploding the fashion of polarization in Brazil, the Padilha film already discussed concepts that are now completely disturbed, José Padilha directs using techniques of Martin Scorsese, sometimes even better than the American director himself, with scenes of incredible shootings and absurdly verisimilitude, German of a camera use without tripe magnifico, not to mention the great narrations in off that serve as a perfect support for the script, not to mention the precise and striking soundtrack, which reflects in an accurate way what is the long. The film is also very well acted, with main highlights for Wagner Moura and Fernanda Machado, besides the sober and mature performance of Andre Ramiro. Tropa de Elite is the movie that opens Jose Padilha to the world, the good and competent director is released to the Holywoodian market, where he ends up not doing well, but ends up finding his talent again when directing series for netflix. ""Tropa De Elite"" is not perfect, but it is a film that exposes much of Brazilian culture to the world, not only negatively, precisely because of this, ""Tropa De Elite"" is difficult to be seen by foreigners because the film is very, very Brazilian."
"Tropa de Elite (Elite Squad) tells the story of honest policemen of an Elite Squad called BOPE (Batalhão de Operações Especiais - Special Operations Squad) of the Rio de Janeiro police.It tells about the pervasive corruption of the regular police, its commanders and the politicians who want money to finance their campaigns.According to the principle that states that the supply only exist because of the demand, the film criticizes the students, specially the left-winged ones, who say they care about the poor people that live on the favelas (very poor houses on Rio de Janeiro hills), which are dominated by the powerful drug dealers, but like to buy drugs from them to ""get high"". They don't realize (or pretend they don't) they help finance the same system they're fighting, the same system that generates new drug dealers to perpetrate itself, based in fear, crime and violence.In the end, the same people that is against the violence is financing it by buying drugs from these criminals. This is a message not only for Brazil, but to every country with crime problems related to drugs: If you don't like the crime and violence brought by the drug market, then don't use drugs, otherwise you will be supporting the same crime you don't like. Don't be the demand. If you don't agree with the other reasons not to use drugs, try to think carefully about this one. If you really ""need"" to get high, go drink something legal, you don't have to help criminals to get high."
"Elite Squad is a punch in the stomach, it is semi-fiction but also 100% pure reality, the best portrait of Rio de Janeiro violence and drug problems from an unexpected perspective. Be sure, this is not the sweetened view of criminality seen in ""Carandiru"", Elite Squad is the new ""Cidade de Deus"", enjoy it's raw reality...Cheers ! And from Wiki: Tropa de Elite (English working title, Elite Squad) is a Brazilian film released on August 24, 2007. The movie is a semi-fictional account of the BOPE, or Batalhão de Operações Policiais Especiais (English, Special Police Operations Battalion) of the Rio De Janeiro Military Police. It is the second feature film and first fiction film of director José Padilha, who had previously directed Bus 174. The script was written by Academy Award-nominated screenwriter Bráulio Mantovani, based on the book A Elite da Tropa by sociologist Luiz Eduardo Soares and two former BOPE captains, André Batista e Rodrigo Pimentel."
"Tropa de Elite does not feel like high art while one is looking at it, but artistically it does score some points. The protagonist is one of the commanders of the BOPE, a special operations battalion that is like a ""death's head unit"" of the police force in Rio de Janeiro, functioning outside the normal chain of command and used for special, super-dangerous missions. Our hero, Captain Nascimento (Wagner Moura), who narrates the film, has served as a BOPE officer for many years, cracked a lot of heads, and is ready to retire. His wife is pregnant with their first child, while he is suffering from depression and fears he may be losing his mind. His eye sockets are permanently dark from worry and exhaustion. Still, the rules of the outfit are clear: if you want to leave, you have to find a replacement. He sets out to find one, and is surprised at the qualities displayed by his new picks. The movie is ultra-violent, showing BOPE's unorthodox interrogation methods, including ""bagging"" (putting a plastic bag over a suspect's head until he starts to suffocate), but what is most frighteningly effective about the movie is thatdespite their unquestionably fascistic appearance and methodsthe BOPE officers have the audience's sympathy by the end. The unit is made up of unprivileged men, and as BOPE officers they function in a world in which ""enlightened"" left-wing rich kids mix with drug-dealers in the slums. These spoiled brats form a socially-conscious NGO with the help of a local politician, and proceed to promote an image of the police as responsible for everything that is wrong in Rio's society. Predictably, their attitude results in tragedy, and the men from BOPE spring into action to set things right. The film is supposedly based on real events in 1997. The Pope, on his visit to Brazil in that year, announced that he wanted to stay with a bishop whose residence abutted one of the most dangerous slums in the city. BOPE was then called in to clean out the mafia elements and make it safe. Very much worth seeing."
"http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/After Fernando Meirelles 2002 City of God put Brazilian cinema on the periphery of audiences worldwide, Brazilian cinema has become saturated with films (and TV) fixated on retelling variations of the same story. These stories are set in Rio's notorious favelas -- a violent world governed by drug dealers, policed by corrupt cops and home to the impoverished. The favelas are a visually stunning real-world setting: overcrowded, decrepit shanty-towns, chiseled into the jagged outcroppings of Rio's coastal mountain range and in stark opposition to the natural beauty of the surrounding forest. It's not that these stories set in the favelas aren't well done --most of them are-- the problem is, every one of these stories looks as if they'd all been shot and edited by the same personnel. And when Rio's favelas showed up in one of Hollywood's biggest summer blockbusters, there was little doubt this trend had reached critical mass.Tropa De Elite (translated: The Elite Squad) picks up on this trend, but does nothing to improve upon it. TDE tells the parallel stories of three cops and how their lives converge and ultimately effect one other's fate. TDE never measures up to its predecessors as a result of a distracted story line, one unsure of where it wants to go and how it wants to be told. While the three central stories seamlessly mingle with one another, approximately halfway through the film, TDE veers off on an awkward tangent, attempting to incorporate the Elite Squad's boot camp training into the story. The storytelling never recovers from this detour and as the first and final acts are stitched back together in the final minutes, TDE simply runs out of steam, exhausting its audience with overkill."
"If this weak movie was made as a special TV show, could pass, but as a movie it fails with its hard popular appeal and its shocking willing.It tries to follow the public and critics success of City of God but behind this ""Carandiru 2: Rio de Janeiro"", there's no highly skilled people like Fernando Meirelles, Kátia Lund or César Charlone. The result is not impressive.The actors are not convincing, too theatrical for a movie. The only one that not disappoint is Wagner Moura as Cpt. Nascimento, but his performance is nothing but enough.The narrative is fragile and the characters are few charismatic, but balanced with tolerable action sequences with good sound effects.The best thing here is the action sequences ambientation. It was filmed in a real slum quarter named Morro Chapéu Mangueira and it gives a nice sensation of realism.As a gratuitous-violence-highly-forgettable-movie it can work... maybe."
"This is one of the worst directed & executed films I've seen for years and years. It's all made by the ""lets jerk around with the camera and cut & paste later""-method. Not ONCE did the director seem to consider a possibility to chose a way of presenting a certain scene to it's best advantage - it's all ""filmed"" by a guy jumping around in sneakers with a camera at half-distance. He even forgot to cut & paste, for the most part. And no, it does not make you feel you're there - it makes you feel sick.It's shame films are still being made using this gimmick, before it will be abandoned. And yes, it's important, because if the technique of the delivery draws more attention than the message you wish to deliver - you've failed.A great subject-matter wasted. 2/10."
"In Rio De Janeiro if you're a cop you can choose to be corrupt, you can choose to ignore what you see or you can choose to go to war(actually this could be a good tag line for the movie). This film is the story of a couple of cops that chose not to ignore what they saw and went to war. The atmosphere is at times suffocating, you feel there's no way out. Not only for the two cops (Neto and Matias) but also for Nascimento. The acting, script and directing were very good. You get into the story easy and hope for a good way out for your favorite characters. I also liked how the film shows the hate they all have (from the people in the slums to the rich people in the city) for the cops in general (the corruption helps a lot here). The hypocrisy of rich people getting upset on the cops for the necessary body check-ups at the check-points, while they themselves buy and use drugs (thus entertaining the drug business and therefore the guns of the drug-dealers and so the necessary body check-ups) is well depicted here. If City of God showed now way out, Elite Squad is certainly presenting one, even though a hard one."
"If you like a lot of action and bright and colorful South American images, this film might be for you. But do not be fooled by the fact that it got the Golden Bear prise at the Berlin festival: there is nothing more than action, corrupt police, vile drug dealers, etc in this film. The emotions of the main hero are mainly transmitted by the off-screen voice to the viewer, and for a good reason: I think the actor was simply unable to show it by his facial expressions. The actor play, in general, is mediocre; the director has done his job properly but without inspiration; and the screenplay is nothing special. The setup is good and probably quite expensive, and bullets are flying in all directions, if that is what you are looking for."
"Life and death are separated by just a moment. We choose to live in a certain way, to achieve specific goals. When all is said and done, though, will we be happy with all we've accomplished?Working as a police officer surrounded with gangs and crime is a daunting task. Knowing tomorrow could very well be your last day is a fact that will haunt your personal life and remain with you while on duty. Then realizing your own fellow officers and superiors are supporting corruption is an even harder pill to swallow. Frequently we risk our lives fighting for the good cause; attempting to preserve peace in a land filled with turmoil. Sometimes it's hard to discern which side is doing that. BOPE is an extreme special forces unit of the military police designed to handle conflicts with lethal measures. Every day these officers, who are parents, spouses and siblings to others, risk their lives and the lives of others in the name of justice. After extensive fighting and anguish, it comes to a point where you question the efficacy of your work. All the lives you have permanently altered, loved ones you have taken away and the effect this has had on your own family. Whether BOPE or a more rudimentary strategy to decrease crime rates is better is subject to debate for another discussion, but the impact BOPE has on the lives of innocent civilians, both positively and negatively, is remarkable. At the end of the day, after all is finished, will you have fought the good fight? Was there a better, more effective, approach? Tropa de Elite is an enlightening film, not for the violent tactics used or exposure of urban warfare in favelas, but because it reveals the lives of those involved and how they significantly influence each other."
"It's the best police movie I've ever seen. It'so realistic, specially the shots. The scene was also perfect!Basically the movie describes the fight between drug dealers and corrupt cops against the good police officers, some of them from the military police force and most of them from BOPE. Although it shows how the corruption of the Military Police Force works out in Brazil, how the system is used against itself and makes everything so difficult that it's almost impossible for honest people to deal with their own personal issues without dealing with corruption. And by the way, that's entirely true. The scene that i like very much is when Captain Nascimento interrogates people. The camera and editing are great, and the actors gave their best action. Two thumbs up..."
"Not only talking about the plot and/or how it does develop and how it is portrayed in the movie. Because within all it's violence and (Full Metal Jacket-like) training sessions, there is much to be found (criticism and heart).But I still was surprised, that this movie won the Golden (Bear) Award at the Berlin Film Festivl. Not really a movie that I would have bet on to be a winner, because it didn't feel like a festival would condone it's violence and rawness. But I was wrong and the jury did acknowledge the quality of the movie, the actors and the (handheld) rawness, which is styled to look like a documentary! It is a bit complex (story-wise and structure wise), but it's more than worth a watch!"
