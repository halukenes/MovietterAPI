"I noticed that A NEW HOPE and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK are in the TOP 10, but that this one isn't even in the TOP 100.This movie has a bad reputation because of Ewoks, but there are so many reasons to love this movie:-The Rescue of Han Solo from Jabba: This official wraps up the Han Solo in debt sub-plot that was established when we first met the character in A NEW HOPE.-The Emperor was Finally Revealled: Well alright this might not work as well now that the prequels are out but this was the first time we saw The Emperor as kids.-The Speeder Bike Chase: Alright, so this was a special effects moment. But it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all the films!-The 3 Part Climax: 1) The Battle of Endor (Led by Han and Leia) 2) Luke Confronts his Father & The Fall of the Emperor 3) The Destruction of the Second Death Star (Lando's Moment)-The Final Celebration with Our Heroes: Like I said, this movie gets a lot of crap because of the Ewoks but I think it's kind of cool that while the entire galaxy celebrates the FALL OF THE EMPIRE, our heroes are having their own private party in the woods with each other.All in all this was a great final chapter for our heroes and a fitting end to the STAR WARS story."
"Star Wars: Episode VI â€“ Return of the Jedi (1983) is a third sequel in the original Star Wars trilogy it is flawed, yet very entertaining solid third sequel and an epic conclusion to the original Star Wars trilogy. Honestly in my opinion Return of the Jedi is far way better film than The Force Awakens, that movie was a disaster and it sucked, I rather watch this movie any time. It is not my favorite film in the series and I don't love this movie that much like I love the first two movies, but I like it and it think it is very good at some points. The film has a lot of problems, that hurts the movie. I still have enjoyed this movie and I had a lot of fun. Return of the Jedi (1983) is directed this time from Richard Marquand a different director than it was directed from Irvin Kershner and George Lucas. This movie was released on the same year that I was born in 1983. The film is pretty good on it is own way, but on the other thing it suffers from problems and flaws.Things I like in this movie: The first hour is set back on planet Tatooine which is a rescue mission which I like, the story is set where the first movie begins and ends here.Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian, Princess Leia Organa, C-3PO, and R2-D2 return to Tatooine to rescue Han Solo (who was encased in carbonite at the end of Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back) from the gangster Jabba the Hutt (voice: Larry Ward).A battle on ship, with Luke steadily taking the fight to Jabba's men. During the battle, Leia strangles Jabba to death with the chain around her neck and with R2-D2's help escapes from her bonds. The heroes destroy the ship, kills the bad guys and save Han solo. I love the explosion, the rescue and than they are all save.I love that we find out from ghost of Obi-Wan ""Ben"" Kenobi (Alec Guinness) that Leia (Carrie Fisher) is the sister of Luke ( Mark Hamill). I love that Luke revels to Leia that she is his sister.I like the battle on the Endor, Leia, Han, Chewbacca, C-3PO, R2-D2 and Ewoks are battling Stormtroopers to destroying the shield generator for the second Death Star and they do the destroy it. Lando and his assault team destroys the deaths tar on the end.Luke face Darth Vader and the evil Emperor and fights both of them, while they where both trying to bring him on a dark side of the force to join them.I love when Vader toys with the notion of turning Leia to the dark side, Luke gives in to his rage and furiously gains the upper hand in the battle, slicing off Vader's right robotic hand in a rage in one swift cut, and makes his father succumb to defeat at the mercy of his son's blade.Realizing that Luke cannot be turned, the Emperor uses Force lightning against him to torture and attempt to kill him. Deeply affected by the sight of his son dying before him, Vader repents and turns on the Emperor, throwing him down a reactor shaft to his death.Luke try's to save Anakin but he dies before he could save him.I feel that Luke's transition from a teenager to calm and collected warrior of the Force feels very authentic. His conflict between Darth Vader and the Emperor contains some of the best scenes in the entire saga.Things I don't like: The film has a few problems that are really unnecessary and I really hate it: This movie's biggest flaw is the pacing, the Ewoks and their role in the film. Star Wars been in a forest, aren't Star Wars suppose to set in the Galaxy and not in the forest? Personally I don't mind the Ewoks, but their introduction causes the movie comes to a screeching halt. Another fault of this movie is its attempts at humor. It feels often unnatural and forced a lot of the time. The Phantom Menace has been notorious for having this problem as well, but they most likely originated here.Master Yoda dies in this film! Why? Watching Yoda in the prequels I have really enjoyed him much more than I have watching him in the last two movies. Little guy grove up in to my heart. So I disagree about him dying.I am giving this movie an 8, I watch A New Hope and Retun of the Jedi on TV as a kid I don't remember watching The Empire Strikes Back, but I have saw those tow movies and still I like Return of the Jedi a lot."
"A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.....There was a boy who was only two years old when the original ""Star Wars"" film was released. He doesn't remember first seeing the movie, but he also doesn't remember life before it. He does remember the first ""Star Wars"" themed gift he got...a shoebox full of action figures from the original set. He was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be. But years later, he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts he's ever received: another box full of action figures, ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection. It's now legendary in this boy's family how the last action figure he needed, Anakin Skywalker, stopped being produced and carried in stores, and how this boy went for about ten years (until he got into college) trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets (don't ask...it's a Northern Illinois University thing).I can't review ""Star Wars"" as a movie. It represents absolutely everything good, fun and magical about my childhood. There's no separating it in my mind from Christmases, birthdays, summers and winters growing up. In the winter, my friends and I would build snow forts and pretend we were on Hoth (I was always Han Solo). My friends' dad built them a kick-ass tree house, and that served as the Ewok village. They also had a huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it, and this made a great spot to pretend we were in Yoda's home. I am unabashedly dorky when it comes to ""Star Wars"" and I think people either just understand that or they don't. I don't get the appeal of ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Star Trek"" but I understand the rabid flocks of fans that follow them because I am a rabid fan of George Lucas's films.I feel no need to defend my opinion of these movies as some of the greatest of all time. Every time I put them in the DVD player, I feel like I'm eight years old again, when life was simple and the biggest problem I had was figuring out how I was going to track down a figure of Anakin Skywalker.Grade (for the entire trilogy): A+"
"I'm sick of people whining about Ewoks!  True, they're not the best thing that ever happened to Star Wars, but they DID happen, so deal with it! Besides, they ARE cute, and I don't care if they're marketable.  Yubb Nubb!This movie always leaves me in tears.  It's perfect.  The end could not be better.  I'm excited for The Phantom Menace because it will suddenly throw the focus of the whole story from Luke to Anakin.  I love how he is revealed at the end - it would be too unresolved any other way.  So those of you who are complaining that Vader's helmet was removed, take a moment to think about it.  It's very effective.  Vader, the man who hid behind a mask for 20 years, is finally revealed as a sick-looking man.  He is not entirely machine - he's vulnerable.I don't know how the casting director happened to pick such good actors in A New Hope.  They all do so well.  They are believable characters.  Hamill does an excellent job with his dramatic character development.  Fisher does a fine job being a female role model (I mean, come on!  She killed Jabba even when so many others had failed!).  Harrison Ford - need I say more?The music is once again brilliant.  It's so very touching and significant when you can pick out character themes at different parts of the movie. The best climax is when Luke shouts ""NOOO!"" and jumps out to fight his father in the Final Battle.  John Williams is nothing short of a genius!  What an amazing man!Already, the movie has so much more meaning for me because of Episode I. I can't wait to finally see it in the theatres (CAN I WAIT???) and then watch the original trilogy yet again.Bravo!"
"This movie is not as flawless as the first two but everything involved with that throne room scenes were some of the highest points in the saga, the final lightsaber battle is just breathtaking and the lovely ending of it, those moments alone makes this one of the most underrated in the whole franchise and in my opinion it's better than a new hope."
"After ""Star Wars: A New Hope"" redefined science fiction, and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" redefined ""Star Wars"", it's hard to believe that the third and final film of this trilogy can manage to be as good as the other two, but this one really does a nice job.  The first part of the film resolves the cliffhanger left by the previous one, with an elaborate escape plan that is in keeping with the incredible suspense and action of the first two films. Then the film moves back to the rebel alliance and what's going on in the war.  There is a lot of action in the scenes building up to the rebellion's final confrontation with the Emperor.  When the battle begins, the audience is already on the edge of their seats from everything leading up to it, and this final battle is even more intense than those from the other films. This climax is definitely more dense with action than any other part of the trilogy, with the most at stake for the rebellion.  This is continually changing between a ground battle between the rebel strike crew on land (including Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Leia), the battle raging on in space (including Lando), and a confrontation between Luke and the Emperor on the new Death Star, which leads up to another duel with Darth Vader.  It is really intense since the rebels constantly seem to be losing the battle that will determine the outcome of the war, and there seems to be no escape. Although I think the idea of Ewoks overpowering stormtroopers is a bit far-fetched, it didn't seem very unrealistic since they were more of a distraction that the rebels could use, rather than an actual threat to the stormtroopers, although they did have some luck fighting them.  There is also a twist or two at the end that nobody saw coming, which may not be quite as stunning as that of ""The Empire Strikes Back"", but still complete a very spectacular trilogy very well.  With the light tone of ""A New Hope"" and the more sinnister tone of ""The Empire Strikes Back"", this film really completes them by combining the two in this grand finale.  The Special Edition for ""Return of the Jedi"" concentrated on what would have been nice to change, since not much of the original really needed it.  Fifteen years of technology advancements didn't seem to make up for fifteen years of deterioration as far as the rancor scene is concerned, and there still is the occasional disappearing TIE fighter, but other than that it was good. The gaping non-threatening Sarlaac's mouth was given moving tentacles and a huge fly-trap looking head that emerged, which definitely added to the suspense.  Also, the disco was taken out of Jabba's palace, and the lame ending of the original was replaced by a huge victory celebration spanning the entire galaxy, instead of just a small Ewok village, which was the case of the original and that didn't really end a story this big the way it deserved.  It's hard to say which of the three films was the best, but since it's all part of the same story, the over-all trilogy is like one big, outstanding film.  A THIRD must-see for film fans."
"Perspective is a good thing.  Since the release of ""Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace"", claims and counter-claims of just how Episode's II and III will eventuate has taken the spotlight off the 'original' Star Wars films, making them part of a cohesive whole, rather than segregating the older and new films into separate trilogies.  What the new films have done is allow fresh perspectives to be placed on the older films.  This new outlook allows us to greater appreciate what has often been viewed as the weakest of the original trilogy: ""Return of the Jedi"".  Often derided for its overly 'cute' factor, ROTJ is in a sense as strong as the original and only slightly less impressive than the nearly perfect ""The Empire Strikes Back"".  Indeed the 'cute' element of ROTJ, namely the Ewoks, remains a weak link in the entire series.  Did George Lucas place the furry midgets in the film purely for the merchandising possibilities?  Only he can answer that question.This cute factor aside, the film is a brilliant full circle AND evolution of the saga.  Following on from the conclusion of ""The Empire Strikes Back"", Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) follows his Rebel Alliance friends to Tatooine, his home planet, to rescue Han Solo (Harrison Ford), the space pirate turned Rebel hero who was captured by Jabba the Hutt for overdue debts.
Skywalker is a changed man since leaving Tatooine with Ben 'Obi Wan' Kenobi (Alec Guiness) to fight the evil Empire.  Now swathed all in black, Luke's discovery of his origins have left him confused and torn.  His psychological make up is not as strong as his outward appearance would suggest.  While he might aim to always assist his Rebel friends, he yearns for another chance to confront the evil Darth Vader again, despite his unassuredness as to whether he will destroy him or eventually turn to the Dark Side and join Vader at the Emperor's side.Early scenes in Tatooine are impressive, from Jabba's lair, to his floating palace and the 'almighty Sarlac' - an intenstine that lives in the sand. Lucas' CGI enhancements to the film in 1997 actually worsened the overall effect of the Sarlac, making it look fake and overdone.
The battle scene on Tatooine is outstanding, and is one of the more memorable of the saga.  Luke almost singlehandedly anihiliates Jabba and his cronies, proving his prowess as a Jedi is now almost complete.When Luke returns to the Degobah system to visit the ailing Yoda one more time, the viewer is let down by Yoda's distinct lack of screentime. Undoubtably the star of ""The Empire Strikes Back"", Yoda is all but erased from the story as the progression of Luke's destiny is played out on screen.
ROTJ really is Luke's film, perhaps even more so than the original.  His journey carries the movie as he moves closer to his confrontation with Darth Vader and his fate.  The other Rebel characters certainly work in his shadow.  The romance between Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Solo is all but non-existant, unlike in ""Empire"".  In fact only Leia's character is developed in ROTJ, Solo's character seems to fade as the facets of his personality have become too familiar in the first two films.Their roles are consigned to working alongside the Rebels to destroy an all new Death Star that nears completion.  This time the Emperor himself is overseeing the final stages of construction.  The Empire intends to crush the Rebellion once and for all, while the Emperor himself schemes to bring the now powerful Skywalker to his side to work alongside (or is that replace?) Darth Vader.  The Emperor is a different kind of evil for this film, less cunning than Governor Tarkin (Peter Cushing) from ""Star Wars"", more deeply psychologically dark than anything else.  Played brilliantly by Ian McDiarmid, the Emperor is just one of those characters you love to hate.All the other actors are well entrenched in their roles.  Hamill surprises as the more wisened Luke, making his character's progression from whiny teenager, impatient student to enlightened warrior one of the few real character developments of the series.  Ford's role is waring thin, as all his charm and charisma was spent in the first two films -- he was the REAL star of the first film after all.  Fisher's Leia is more of a prop, at least unti the end of the film where she learns things about herself that she was never sure about...  Add in favourites like Alec Guiness as Kenobi, Yoda and the loveable Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2D2 and the series resembles a family more than a cast.Despite the film's corny forest battle involving the Ewoks and the Empire, it ends well and includes a three way battle sequence: on Endor, in space and on the Death Star, each with very impressive special effects.  The music, as always, is brilliant and captures the mood perfectly in every instance.  Just as the 'Blue Danube' worked perfectly for ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", John Williams' score is as much a part of ""Star Wars"" folklore as light sabers and the Force.Lucas left the ending open to interpretation, meaning there could have been more episodes made.  Indeed sci-fi fans have created their own versions of Episodes VII, VIII and IX in their heads over and over again.  ROTJ works when given a chance, and furry cute animals aside is a good finish to the series.When all six episodes get to be viewed together, this saga could well be the best ever made.  Is it already?  The addition of Episode I changed the landscape of the series.  This is why ""Return of the Jedi"" can now be viewed in a different light and be given a whole new appreciation nearly 20 years after its release."
"Star Wars Episode VI - Return of the Jedi was released and 1983 and it is the end of the original Star Wars trilogy.Out of the original trilogy, this film is usually known as the weakest and for the right reasons. Again the director was replaced, this time Irvin Kershner with Richard Marquand which resulted in poor pacing and the introduction of kid-friendly Ewoks who completely undercut the dark tone The Empire Strikes Back set up.Aside from that, I have no issues other with Return of the Jedi. It finally revealed the terrifying Emperor, we saw Luke as a badass and a very powerful Jedi and his battle with Darth Vader eventually leading up to a very satisfying and emotional conclusion. Another quality of Return of the Jedi is that it has the single best opening and the first act of any other Star Wars film. Also, we were introduced to many interesting alien species (not you Ewoks) who played a crucial role in the rebellion's success against the Empire.Like the first two parts of the trilogy, Return of the Jedi is filled with beautiful and detailed scenes, great battles (such as the Battle of Endor) and memorable visual and sound effects.Final Rating - 9-/10"
"Up until the sixth and last episode of the Star Wars saga, which finally ended in 2005, I had always looked at this 1983 entry as my favorite film of the long-running series. The varied action scenes and really different characters (Jabba The Hut, furry woodland creatures, etc.) made this a particularly appealing movie.None of the action ever focused too long in one spot, either. The last half hour exemplifies this the most as the scene switches every few minutes from the woods to the battle among space ships to the individual laser-duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader.Another nice characteristic this film had that the two previous did not was the absence of in-fighting between two of the stars. Gone was the incessant bickering between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. Finally, everyone was on the same page! It was nice to see.In the end, this was simply a wonderful adventure tale, more than anything else."
"My five children were growing up but all still at home when 'Return of the Jedi' came to the theater. While there had been other Sci-Fi movies with a theme of conflict in outer space, the 'Star Wars' trilogy filled our imaginations like no other movies before them. The fantastic, strange worlds were presented almost like we were there too. Aliens sitting around a tavern, enjoying drinks and speaking in all sorts of languages. Nothing before had approached the sheer size of the space ships depicted here, huge cities traveling all over the galaxy. And how about the jump to hyper speed, then disappearing from the screen as the speed exceeds light speed! And the light sabres of the Jedi Knights. The Jedi Knights, a striking parallel to the Japanese Samurai.After the fantastic 'Star Wars' and 'Empire Strikes Back' (now called parts IV and V on DVD), the last episode 'Return of the Jedi' was bound to be somewhat of a let down, but not much of one. It was made to achieve resolution. Of the rebels' battle with the evil Empire. The relationship between Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, and the Princess, and her relationship with Han Solo. We witness Luke's Jedi training at the hands of Yoda, as Luke becomes the Last Samurai, I mean Jedi. The DVDs finally came out last month, and they are near perfect, as we should expect from Lucas Films and THX. The bit rate is high, and the picture is nothing short of superb. As is the Dolby EX surround track. My wife and I watched all three of the movies on DVD this week -- Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi (now on DVD called parts IV, V, and VI) -- compliments of our local public library. It was an appropriate reminder how good these movies are, and still ahead of their time. Nothing else has been made to compare to them."
"This final entry in George Lucas's STAR WARS movies is often regarded as the weakest of the lot. However, this is not to say that it is a totally worthless entry in the series. On the contrary. Sure, it's not as groundbreaking as its predecessors and a bit more slow-going at times, but RETURN OF THE JEDI still offers a lot to warrant the price of admission.The first third of the movie, where Luke and his friends rescue Han from the palace of Jabba the Hutt, is a classic. Jabba, a truly disgusting blob of bloated flesh who speaks in his own language, not only makes a great villain, but a memorable one, too. It must have been a nightmare to construct this giant puppet, much less give it the spark and life that we see on the finished product. Actually, what also makes this sequence fun is the clever use of puppets for the various members of Jabba's court, including the intimidating, slavering Rancor and scary Sarlaac pit monster. It builds masterfully to its climax and pulls punches all the while.Things get a little bit slower around the second act, where Luke discovers that he and Leia are related by blood and when we travel to the forest planet of Endor, home of the cuddlesome yet stalwart Ewoks. Most of the complaints about RETURN OF THE JEDI that I've read seem to be centered on these furry creatures, in that they somehow disrupt the tone of the saga. I don't totally agree with that, although this moment is probably played out a bit longer than it should. However, their leader, Wicket (played by Warrick Davis) is a delightfully memorable creation, and watching how they handle the Imperial Troops' technology with their simple, natural weapons provides a nice contrast.By the time we get to the third act, though, the pace picks up again, as we intercut between the Ewoks battle against the troops, Lando and the Rebel Forces launching an attack against the Empire's all-new half-completed Death Star, and Luke's final showdown with Darth Vader and the Emperor. The latter ties with the Jabba Palace sequence as the highlight of the movie. Mark Hamill flexes his acting chops once again as Luke Skywalker in these scenes, and watching him as a fully matured Jedi Knight makes for an unforgettable performance. Also, as iconic as James Earl Jones' voice as Darth Vader is, he is rivaled only by the shriveled, crone-like Emperor, played with deliciously raspy, frightening evil by Ian McDiarmid. The tension between this trio heightens the excitement of this climactic moment, which is appropriately darkly lit and menacingly underscored.The STAR WARS movies have always set standards for special effects, and the technical work in RETURN OF THE JEDI can easily hold a candle to its predecessors. The space battle fights are as exhilarating as always, and the speeder bike chase through the forest is a knockout. Of course, given that this movie was made after A NEW HOPE and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, it probably shouldn't be so surprising that the special effects have reached an even greater level of excellence. The acting is classic STAR WARS fare; Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher all mature and deepen into their roles, and Anthony Daniels provides more hilarious moments as C-3PO. Frank Oz's Yoda only appears in two scenes, but he makes the most of it. And yes, there's also John Williams' music.All told, while RETURN OF THE JEDI falters a little bit in the middle, the first and third acts deliver in style, making this a rather satisfactory finale to one of the greatest sagas ever.In 1997, George Lucas re-released the classic STAR WARS in digitally restored (and revamped) ""Special Editions"", which featured added-in effects and/or shots as well as some enhancements. Of the three, RETURN OF THE JEDI appears to have caused the most commotion with STAR WARS fans. Perhaps it can be due to the jarringly out-of-place (albeit funny if you're not so easily offended) ""Jedi Rocks"" musical number in Jabba's Palace, which, although technically amazing, does disrupt the flow of the film. However, I DID like the ending montage scenes where we see victory celebrations occurring on the various planets of the galaxy. This DVD version features yet more tweaking--we get to see more montage finale scenes (notably on Naboo, where we hear what sounds like Jar Jar Binks screaming, ""Wesa free!""), and, in what is probably the most controversial change, Hayden Christensen as the specter of Anakin Skywalker in the closing scenes. Probably due to the intense (and unfair) disdain fans have for his somewhat shaky work in EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES it seems inevitable that fans would put this edition down for that alone. However, if you're watching the STAR WARS saga chronologically (and contemplating about it), chances are you may react a little differently. Nonetheless, it is an issue that fans have raised, so it's probably best to be warned beforehand.As nice as it would be to have Lucas release the original versions of these three classic films, he nonetheless stands by what he said about these revamps being the ""definitive"" editions of his classic trilogy, and, when viewing the STAR WARS movies altogether as one complete saga (as Lucas intended), it actually makes sense to keep them technically and aurally consistent. The original films will always be engraved in our memories, but these new incarnations are just as much fun, if one can give them a chance."
"Return of the Jedi is certainly the most action packed of the series, and is a fine conclusion to the Star Wars Saga. With Han Solo imprisoned by Jabba the Hut and the Empire building a new Death Star, the rebel alliance is facing an uphill struggle against the dark side, and only our favourite heroes can pull it off.The Opening sequence, set on Tatooine, we see Jabba's palace, a pit of slavery and scum, and new home to Han Solo, as Luke and the gang prepare for his rescue, and with Luke's Jedi powers, they have the edge.We also witness a tremendous triple battle at the end. Han, Leia and Chewy battle it out on Endor, desperate to deactivate the shields protecting the Death Star. The Rebel Fleet led by Lando, battle with the Imperial Fleet while they wait for the shields to go down, and Luke has a final showdown with Darth Vader. An Epic end to a Classic Saga, and it's only just of the pace of the first two.10/10"
"Despite the feelings of most ""Star Wars"" fans, in my opinion ""Return Of The Jedi"" is the greatest cinematic film ever created. Ever since the first time I saw it, it's depth, intensity, special effects, and moving story have overwhelmed me. The film was so well put together that it has been able to stand the test of time over the last 20 years. Filled with powerful action, as the climax of the original trilogy, George Lucas gives us a rousing finish of the ""Star Wars"" saga in ""Jedi"".Film Summary (Contains Spoilers For Those Who Have Not Seen It)After ""The Empire Strikes Back"" left us hanging for 3 long years we finally find the end of the story in ""Return Of The Jedi"". Darth Vader, in emotional turmoil makes a surprise visit to a new uncompleted Death Star to oversee it's construction. The Emperor is first seen in this film as he has the ultimate plan to destroy the Rebel Alliance and bring young Luke Skywalker to the Dark Side. Luke, Lando, Leia, Chewie, and the droids all travel to Tatooine to rescue the frozen Han Solo from the crime Lord; Jabba The Hutt. After Han has been rescued, and Jabba defeated, Luke returns to Dagobah to find a dying Yoda where he learns the awful truth; Darth Vader is in fact his father. The rebel heroes regroup with the Rebel Fleet. Now joined by other species and races including the Mon Calamari the Rebels must make a all-or-nothing plan of attack to destroy the Death Star before it is completed. While Lando heads the space attack in the Millennium Falcon, the Rebel heroes must disable the Death Star's shield generator on the Forest Moon Of Endor. It is here that the Rebels happen upon the furry, but mighty Ewoks. During the the two part intense battle, a third battle must take place as Luke willingly delivers himself to Vader in an attempt to convince him to leave the Dark Side. In emotionally charged sequences Luke must face his father as the Emperor lures out his dark emotions. As young Skywalker is about to face his death at the hands of Palpatine, Vader turns on his wicked master to save his son's life. Filled with a deep timeless story of good vs. evil, ""Return Of The Jedi"" is a spectacular, emotionally charged film that redeems the good in all of us."
"After watching A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back, it's time to watch the final chapter of the Star Wars film franchise, The Return of the Jedi.It stars Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, David Prowse, Frank Oz, Anthony Daniels, etc.The Empire is more than halfway through construction of a new Death Star - almost twice as big, but more than twice as powerful. When completed, it will spell certain doom for Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and the Rebels. Han Solo (Harrison Ford) is a prisoner of crime lord Jabba the Hutt, and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) soon finds herself in the gangster's hands. Luke Skywalker, aided by C-3PO and R2-D2, makes his way into Jabba's palace, hoping to secure his friends' freedom. But the Hutt has no intention of doing so and tries to kill them all. After escaping from Jabba and the sands of Tatooine, they regroup with the Rebel fleet, which is massing for an attack against the new satellite battle station at Endor. Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) is pressed into action to lead the Rebel fighter attack, while Han is put in charge of a group of soldiers to take out the shield generator protecting the Death Star. Luke, however, surrenders to Vader's soldiers on Endor, and is taken in front of Vader's boss - the Galactic Emperor - on the Death Star for final corruption to the Dark Side of the Force. The fleet of Imperial Star Destroyers ambushes the Rebels, cutting them off. Worse, the new Death Star begins turning its giant laser on the Rebel carriers. It appears that nothing will stop the Empire's triumph - unless things start to change quickly.I thought it was a great end to the Star Wars series.But in 1999, the story took itself back into the beginning with Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace and ended with Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith.So far, I'm finished with the Star Wars original trilogies, and there will be more reviews in the summer.Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi gets 10 stars."
"In many ways, Return of the Jedi cut firmly against the brilliant grain set by Empire Strikes Back. The reason Empire was so effective was that it showed us the rebels were still losing, you can't just destroy the Death Star and have everything go away. But here, Lucas rounds out the trilogy with another climactic space battle and everything wraps up really nicely with no questions ask. Return of the Jedi is clearly the least impressive of the original trilogy. It is full of holes, tonal inconsistencies and plot implausibilities. I'd chalk this up to Richard Marquand not being half as competent as Irvin Kershner, and the departure of Gary Kurtz from the project. Kurtz reportedly left because he and Lucas couldn't agree on whether story or spectacle should take priority (Lucas was obviously in favour of spectacle), and you can tell because Return of the Jedi's story makes absolutely no sense in places.The opening sequences in Jabba's palace entertained me to no end as a child, but now it just confuses me. How long has it been since Empire Strikes Back? Didn't Lando and Chewie go in to try and rescue Han? Chewie and the droids are turned over to Jabba, but Leia seems ready to get Han out of there and leave them behind. Was it the plan to get captured? Was Luke's plan to get captured? Since when can Luke do Jedi mind tricks? Did Luke go back and train with Yoda for a year, and if so, why wasn't ""is Vader really my father"" not asked then? The film's screenplay is quite messy and doesn't flow on from the rest of the saga. In one typical scene, Yoda admonishes Luke for rushing off to face Vader without proper training, then says he doesn't need anymore training and only when he confronts Vader will he be a Jedi. Again, maybe some concrete evidence on how long has passed would help. This film is the point where the story meant little to Lucas and the details even less (Solo is promoted from Captain to General where all he did was get frozen in carbonite, and Calrissian walks off the street into the role of General!). I've always regarded Darth Vader quite lowly on my list of movie villains, and watching Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back I found myself wondering why. I now realise its because Return of the Jedi completely nukes him. The idea of there still being good in Vader comes completely out of nowhere - he tortured his son with the knowledge that his father is the most evil man in the galaxy and then chopped his hand off and let him fall to his likely death. The addition of Emperor Palpatine also relegates Darth Vader to a side character - during the conversations between Luke and the Emperor, Vader sort of stands diffently to the side and chips in with the occasional ""yeah. what he said."" Palpatine's character development pretty much begins and ends with ""evil"" - he seems so sure that Luke will join him, yet Luke's battle with the dark side emerges only as a plot point in those scenes. Even if Luke turns to the dark side, what will make him join Palpatine? The expanded universe implies more information about this, but its not very well established here. The execution is pretty inconsistent - Luke goes from being Alec Guinness-style calm to flailing his lightsaber around like he's never held one before. Now that I mention it, Mark Hamill seems to be playing two characters simultaneously. I've covered what I didn't like, but this is a Star Wars film and there's so much to love. The epic space battle at the second Death Star only reminds me how much I missed it in Empire Strikes Back. Ford is having a lot of fun in this movie, and the rest of the cast delivers pretty solidly as well. The gorgeously shot introduction of Red Guards in stark contrast with the white stormtroopers is a beautiful throwback to Vader's black/white contrast in the original Star Wars, and once again, it tells us the bars have been raised. The sound editing/mixing is always in good form in Star Wars - my favourite scene being a harsh lightsaber ignition sound just as Luke says Vader won't hurt him or turn him over to Palpatine. The Battle of Endor walks a narrow line between cheesy and genuinely exciting, and Marquand keeps the Ewoks just shy of the Gungans.Return of the Jedi is a really fun movie, but its not a cinematic artwork like its predecessors. I grew up watching this film, but when I read about where the story would have gone were it not for Lucas' toy revenue - the death of Han Solo and a tired Luke walking into the distance like an old Western - I'd be lying if I said the film's sickly sweet dance party ending didn't stick in my craw just a bit."
"...Maybe my personal take? The original Star Wars (1977) was genre changing. The second Star Wars (1980) was an unexpected sequel, a blockbuster in every sense of the word. This third one....well, it made it easy to say goodbye for 16 years and to have lowered expectations when the prequels started arriving in 1999.It just takes itself too seriously. ""I know he's OK....I can feeeel it!"". Oh, brother. Talking about The Farce being with you. And no I did not just misspell that word. Obi Wan returns in spirit form to rewrite some history so Luke did not just get thrown over for Han Solo because girls just love the bad boys, but there is some reason and purpose behind it. ""So you told me a bunch of lies?"" Luke asks his one time mentor. ""Well that depends upon what your definition of the word ""IS"" is""...being the gist of how Obi Wan answers him.And we have a fairly meaningless chase through a rain forest, and the most commercial purposeless creature ever created in cinematic history up to that date - the Ewok. Be sure to ask for a miniature for your kids when you order a Big Mac and fries.I've been hard on Episode VI in light of how great IV and V were. I'm giving it a seven because compared to other films, that is what it is. Compared to its two predecessors it is probably a six. Compared to what Disney has done to the franchise, though, it is probably an eleven!"
"This is the film that pretty much answers all the questions.  One thing that I did notice is that it dealt with the theme of redemption.  Luke pretty much wanted to redeem his father's good name and at the end Vader regains his humanity just in time not only to save his son Luke, but to destroy the Emperor, the man who cost Vader his soul.  I also liked the scene in the film where 3PO summarizes the events of the previous chapters for the Ewoks. This also helps to tie everything together as far as the saga is concerned. Also, even though many have called this the weakest film in the trilogy, it still has enough of a story and great special effects to put it on a par with the previous films."
"Long ago, in a Galaxy far away came a film which saved FOX studios from bankruptcy. It was conceived by a 16 year old George Lucas after he saw the 1959 film Ben Hur. This gave him the ideas which are now lynch pins of the entire series - an all powerful force, an evil empire, emperor, a purpose for our universe.This is the best of the series & not just because of the victory over the Empire. It springs a surprise in Luke having a sister, & completes Luke confronting what is left of his father. It destroys an empire & an emperor. It introduces Ewoks & then has them join in an alliance to create the victory. It even makes C3PO a God, & you can't top that.While it does not have a miracle create the complete victory, like Ben Hur does with Christs Crucifixation & events erasing Ben Hur's mother & sisters Leprocey, it does create a man made miracle alliance which ultimately destroys the evil Empire. This really counts big in the scheme of things.There is an ultimate satisfaction in the victory, especially when everyone including Ben, & Darth seem to be a part of it. That is what makes this the ultimate celebration."
"After ''Empire strikes back'' ''Return of the Jedi'' is my second favorite movie from the Star Wars series.Luke went to Tattoine to save Han Solo from Jabba. At the same time, the Galactic Empire is doing in secret, the construction of a new space station like the previous Death Star. If this station stays totally constructed, it will be the end of the Rebel Alliance. Both Vader and the Emperor are impatient because of the delay of the new Death Star,and they need to kill many of their commanders to have the project made in schedule.R2 and C3po are inside Jabba's palace to send a message from Luke to Jabba,where Lukes pretends to negotiate Han's life. He gives R2 and C3po as a gift to Jabba as part of his plan. Jabba does not accept the negotiation,since he is using Han Solo as a piece of his palace's decoration.(Han still is frozen in carbonite) Lando is hidden as Jabba's guard and Chewbacca is also gave to Jabba by a reward hunter. When the same Hunter tries to save Han solo and makes him stay in human form again, we see that is actually princess Leia in a disguise. The problem is that Jabba discovers Leia's plan and takes her as his slave,while Han is thrown away in Chewbacca's cell.Luke comes as a Jedi knight to rescue his friends. At his first try to kill Jabba,he falls into Jabba's monster cell (Bantha),but easily kills it. Jabba stays angry and decides to thrown Han,Chewbacca and Luke to Sarlacc, a big creature from the desert who stays 1.000 years digesting it's 'food'. Luke,Han and Chewie has success in scape again, and even Boba Fett dies when Han accidentally throws him in to Sarlacc's mouth. Leia kills Jabba and goes after Han,Luke and Chewie as well c3po and R2. Everybody's safe again,Luke decides to go to Dagoba to complete his training as a Jedi,as well his promise to Yoda. The problem is that Yoda is too old and sick, since he already has 900 years old, and before he dies, Yoda says to Luke that he does not need more training,but to really be a Jedi, he must fight with Vader again. He confirms to Luke that Vader is Luke's dad, and that there is another Skywalker besides Luke. In his last moments, Yoda asks to Luke to remember his advices about the temptation of the dark side, and to Luke transmit his Jedi knowledge to other people. When Yoda dies,Obi wan's spirit shows up to Luke and tells him that Luke's father killed his good side Anakin to become Darth Vader, and also that he is more machine than a man since he became a sith. Luke stays worried about killing his own dad, and says that he feels that his father still has kindness. Obi Wan tells Luke that his twin sister is Leia, and says the reasons why Luke and Leia were separated since babies. He gives his last advice to Luke saying that if he refuses to kill Vader, the emperor will win the war.At the same time, the Emperor says to Vader that he must give Luke to him when he shows up, since Luke is stronger than before, and they both needs to combine their efforts to bring Luke to the dark side.Now we are going to have one of the best battles from the star war series,when the Rebel Alliance plans to attack the new space station, the '' Death Star 2'', Luke will confront Vader and the Emperor, and Leia, Han and chewie needs to turn off the 'Death star 2' power field, with the help of the EWOKS. (little creatures who looks little bears)This is for sure one of the most exciting star wars of all!"
"Easily my least favorite of the first three films.  WAY too much cutesy-poo, some below-par special effects, and the *worst* extras in the business -- remember the guy who says ""You Rebel Scum?""  How about 87 different Imperials saying ""Freeze! -- Don't move!""  at different points?  What is this, a bad 70's cop show?I have heard rumors that Lucas originally planned to have Endor populated by Wookies, which would have been *far* more interesting than those obnoxious little Ewoks, who simply stretched my credulity past the breaking point.  I mean, the Storm Troopers have *helmets* on -- yet a 3-foot teddy bear with a stick can take one down with a couple of ineffectual whacks to the head? Please..."
"I thought that ROTJ was clearly the best out of the three Star Wars movies. I find it surprising that ROTJ is considered the weakest installment in the Trilogy by many who have voted. To me it seemed like ROTJ was the best because it had the most profound plot, the most suspense, surprises, most emotional,(especially the ending) and definitely the most episodic movie. I personally like the Empire Strikes Back a lot also but I think it is slightly less good than than ROTJ since it was slower-moving, was not as episodic, and I just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as I did with the third movie.It also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for ROTJ being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as a whole. I have heard many strange reasons such as: a) Because Yoda died b) Because Bobba Fett died c) Because small Ewoks defeated a band of stormtroopers d) Because Darth Vader was revealedI would like to debunk each of these reasons because I believe that they miss the point completely. First off, WHO CARES if Bobba Fett died??? If George Lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to die. Don't get me wrong I am fan of Bobba Fett but he made a few cameo appearances and it was not Lucas' intention to make him a central character in the films that Star Wars fans made him out to be. His name was not even mentioned anywhere in the movie... You had to go to the credits to find out Bobba Fett's name!!! Judging ROTJ because a minor character died is a bit much I think... Secondly, many fans did not like Yoda dying. Sure, it was a momentous period in the movie. I was not happy to see him die either but it makes the movie more realistic. All the good guys can't stay alive in a realistic movie, you know. Otherwise if ALL the good guys lived and ALL the bad guys died this movie would have been tantamount to a cheesy Saturday morning cartoon. Another aspect to this point about people not liking Yoda's death.. Well, nobody complained when Darth Vader struck down Obi Wan Kenobi in A New Hope. (Many consider A New Hope to be the best of the Trilogy)  Why was Obi Wan's death okay but Yoda's not... hmmmmmmmmmmmm.... Another reason I just can not believe was even stated was because people found cute Ewoks overpowering stormtroopers to be impossible. That is utterly ridiculous!! I can not believe this one!! First off, the Ewoks are in their native planet Endor so they are cognizant of their home terrain since they live there. If you watch the movie carefully many of the tactics the Ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers was through excellent use of their home field advantage. (Since you lived in the forest all your life I hope you would have learned to use it to your advantage) They had swinging vines, ropes, logs set up to trip those walkers, and other traps. The stormtroopers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware of the advantages of the forest. The only thing they had was their blasters. To add,  it was not like the Ewoks were battling the stormtroopers themselves, they were heavily assisted by the band of rebels in that conquest. I thought that if the stormtroopers were to have defeated a combination of the Star Wars heros, the band of rebels, as well as the huge clan of Ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain, that would have been a great upset. Lastly, if this scene was still unbelievable to you.. How about in Empire Strikes Back or in A New Hope where there were SEVERAL scenes of a group consisting of just Han Solo, Chewbacca, and the Princess, being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters missed while the heros were in full view!! And not only that, the heroes , of course, always hit the Stormtroopers with their blasters. The troopers must have VERY, VERY bad aim then! At least in Empire Strikes Back, the Battle of Endor was much more believable since you had two armies pitted each other not 3 heroes against a legion of stormtroopers. Don't believe me? Check out the battle at Cloud City when our heroes were escaping Lando's base. Or when our heros were rescuing Princess Leia and being shot at  (somehow they missed)as Han Solo and Luke were trying to exit the Death Star.The last reason that I care to discuss (others are just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here.) is that people did not like Darth Vader being revealed! Well, in many ways that was a major part of the plot in the movie. Luke was trying to find whether or not Darth Vader was his father, Annakin Skywalker. It would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without Luke getting to see his father's face because it made it complete. By Annakin's revelation it symbolized the transition Darth Vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side (in his helmet) and to the good person he was Annakin Skywalker (by removing the helmet). The point is that Annakin died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet removal scene was about. In fact, that's is what I would have done in that scene too if I were Luke's father...Isn't that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eyes before you died and not in a mechanized helmet?On another note, I think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel MUST be worse (even if it is better) that preceding movies is another reason that ROTJ does not get as many accolades as it deserves. I never go into a film with that deception in mind, I always try to go into a film with the attitude that ""Well, it might be better or worse that the original .. But I can not know for sure.. Let's see."" That way I go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into thinking that a clearly superior film is not as good as it really was.I am not sure who criticizes these movies but, I have asked many college students and adults about which is their favorite Star Wars movie and they all tell me (except for one person that said that A New Hope was their favorite) that it is ROTJ. I believe that the results on these polls are appalling and quite misleading.Bottom line, the Return of the Jedi was the best of the Trilogy. This movie was the only one of the three that kept me riveted all throughout its 135 minutes. There was not a moment of boredom because each scene was either suspenseful, exciting, surprising, or all of the above. For example, the emotional light saber battle between Luke and his father in ROTJ was better than the one in the Empire Strikes Back any day!!!Finally, I hope people go see the Phantom Menace with an open mind because if fans start looking for nitpicky, insignificant details (or see it as ""just another sequel"") to trash the movie such as ""This movie stinks because Luke is not in it!"" then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like ROTJ suffered unfortunately."
"When it comes to creating a universe George Lucas is the undisputed master and his final Star Wars film is very, very good (and more appropriately rated in comparison to the two previous films in the original saga). Having recently seen Revenge of the Sith really puts this movie in perspective. The final battle seems even more climactic knowing what Anakin Skywalker went through at the manipulative hands of the Emperor. It also makes the final battle between Luke and Vader more bitter considering the love he felt for PadmÃ© and the love she felt for her children. Actually while the new films (especially Episode II) are inferior to the original films they are good for one reason only. They make the old films seem even better.Mark Hamill does an exceptional job in this movie. He really brings the changes Luke has gone through seem real. In all fairness I believe that he should have become a big actor based on these films because he really does a great job. Harrison Ford is still good. However, you can feel that he has done Raiders and Blade Runner in between the two final chapters of Star Wars because he seems to have grown quite a bit. He adds more comedy (obviously inspired from Raiders) to the character which works brilliantly. In short Han Solo is better than ever. Carrie Fisher was never really a good actress but she does a decent job and is certainly passable. Ian McDiarmid appears in this film and having seen Episode III I can safely say that he is one of the most accomplished villains ever. James Earl Jones still provides the voice for Vader and he is still very, very good.In terms of how the movie looks its pretty safe to say that the Star Wars universe looks better than in either of the previous (two) movies but this was always Lucas' fortÃ© so that is really to be expected. The final battle over Endor is very well made both in terms of the general effects and tension wise. It was also a nice touch that Lucas decided to have three battles take place at the same time as it added to the overall tension of the climax. The only thing I feel is dragging the movie down from an otherwise deserved 9 are the Ewoks. These little creatures are so annoying they almost ruin every scene they are in. Besides I find it to be a little to kiddy when a group of teddy bears with bows and arrows can defeat a squadron of Storm Troopers with laser guns and mighty machinery.All in all Return of the Jedi is a very good movie but the fact that Richard Marquand is a less accomplished director than Irvin Kershner does that the overall feel of the movie is less than brilliant. Also George Lucas' stupid decision to add the Ewoks to the universe does that the film falls short of brilliance.8/10"
"I very nearly walked out, but I'd paid my money, and my nearly-as-disgusted friend wanted to hold out. After the endearing, wide-eyed innocence of ""A New Hope"" and the thrilling sophistication of ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" I remember awaiting ""Return of the Jedi"" with almost aching anticipation. But from the opening scene of this insultingly commercial sewage, I was bitterly disappointed, and enraged at Lucas. He should have been ashamed of himself, but this abomination undeniably proves that he doesn't have subatomic particle of shame in his cold, greedy heart. Episode I would go on to reinforce this fact -- your honor, I call Jarjar Binks (but please issue barf bags to the members of the jury first).From the initial raising of the gate at Jabba's lair, this ""film"" was nothing more than a two-plus-hour commercial for as many licensable, profit-making action figures as Lucas could cram into it -- the pig-like guards, the hokey flesh-pigtailed flunky, that vile muppet-pet of Jabba's, the new and recycled cabaret figures, the monsters, etc., etc., ad vomitum. Then there were the detestably cute and marketable Ewoks. Pile on top of that all of the rebel alliance aliens. Fifteen seconds each on-screen (or less) and the kiddies just GOTTA have one for their collection. The blatant, exploitative financial baiting of children is nauseating.Lucas didn't even bother to come up with a new plot -- he just exhumed the Death Star from ""A New Hope"" and heaved in a boatload of cheap sentiment. What an appalling slap in the face to his fans. I can't shake the notion that Lucas took a perverse pleasure in inflicting this dreck on his fans: ""I've got these lemmings hooked so bad that I can crank out the worst piece of stinking, putrid garbage that I could dream up, and they'll flock to the theaters to scarf it up. Plus, all the kiddies will whine and torture their parents until they buy the brats a complete collection of action figures of every single incidental undeveloped, cartoonish caricature that I stuffed in, and I get a cut from every single one. It'll make me even more obscenely rich.""There may have been a paltry, partial handful of redeeming moments in this miserable rip-off. I seem to recall that Harrison Ford managed to just barely keep his nose above the surface of this cesspool. But whatever tiny few bright spots there may be are massively obliterated by the offensive commercialism that Lucas so avariciously embraced in this total, absolute sell-out to profit."
"How can any adult who enjoyed ""Star Wars"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" possibly find anything entertaining, or even interesting, about this abysmal, unimaginative travesty?  A genuinely bad movie, truly awful in every possible way, ""Jedi"" features a screenplay aimed squarely at four year olds and absolutely terrible acting from an understandably embarrassed cast; in addition, the film offers us the shoddiest array of cheap, plastic-looking space aliens since Irwin Allen's ""Lost In Space"" tv series. Yes, I realize it is this very cheapness that endears the movie to a legion of kitsch loving fans, but, as a direct follow-up to ""Empire,"" one of the most entertaining and inventive fantasy movies of the last twenty years, ""Jedi"" comes across as a particularly insulting spit in the face from George Lucas.  And those godawful teddy bears!  Is there anyone out there (over the age of four, that is) who doesn't cringe in horror at just the mere thought of those monstrously cute creatures?"
"So the legendary original trilogy ""Star Wars"" came up to its logical end, for 6 years it excited the minds of the audience. Lucas and the company present to us the long-awaited finale, which will finally put all the points in the fates of the heroes and give us one of the most spectacular space battles between Good and Evil.This time, the little-known Richard Markwand sits in the director's chair. All of us favorite ""father"" STAR WARS George Lucas acted only as a screenwriter. For which it can be praised, because the script was very good, without long actions and dialogues, and most importantly-exciting.The Far-Far Galaxy becomes the battlefield between the Empire and the Rebels. The construction of the second Death Star is coming to an end, and anticipating an early attack of the rebels, the head of the evil galactic state Emperor Palpatine arrives at the station to watch the battle, arrogantly hoping for the victory of the imperial forces. Meanwhile, the drama continues to develop between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. The former farm boy knew the Force and now he is waiting for the final fight with Lord Sith. Luke believes that there is still good in him and that there is still a chance for salvation.In addition to meeting with Vader Luke, in the company of his friends: Leah, Chewbacca and the droids R2D2 and C3PO saves Han Solo from the slippery claws of the gangster Jabba the Hutt. And soon the main characters are reunited with the forces of the Rebellion to prepare for the final battle.Actor's game, once again, you can praise. Mark Hammil again shone. The tension he felt, fighting inside himself with anger, spurred by the Emperor, was transmitted from the screen and made him feel empathic with the protagonist. Carrie Fisher, this time, supplemented her game with a beautiful figure, so often flashed at the beginning of the picture. Harrison Ford once again proved that he is an excellent actor who does not give up his position. I would especially like to note Ian McDiarmid. The image of the Emperor was excellent. How much evil, arrogance, excessive pride. This actor played Palpatine just as well in the prequel trilogy.Visual effects, as it should for STAR WARS, are performed at the highest level of quality. The abundance of space battles, fights on lightsabers, technology - all this due to high quality becomes a matter of good nostalgia. I really liked the new characters - Ewoks, little bear cubs-aborigines of the green planet Endor, on whose orbit the ""Death Star"" was built.I want to say a big thank you to John Williams for the fact that this magnificent composer rejoiced with his delightful melodies throughout all the sagas, both original and prequel trilogy.The picture has once again proved that, no matter how gloomy and dark the world is, even the slightest ray of light can illuminate this world.George, along with Richard, completed the saga dignifiedly, in a big way. But, as we know, Lucas's imagination is unlimited and the departure to the history of the Star Wars has been postponed, since 16 years later a new episode appeared - ""The Hidden Menace"", which marked the return of the phenomenon to the screens."
"I first became a Star Wars fan with the help of my father who would sit with me and watch the entire trilogy together. I always loved A New Hope [which I always called Star Wars up until the re-release because we had the original VHS set], had a semi-dislike of The Empire Strikes Back [but, I have grown to like it now], and absolutely loved The Return of the Jedi. My favorite scene was always the ending scene of Luke looking at the three Jedi Masters of his life.And now I after watching the DVD edition, I miss Sebastian Shaw, the original Anakin Skywalker. Now, I am forced to watch Hayden Christensen take his spot. Yes, he is who portrays Anakin before and during his fall to the dark side in the beginning trilogy, but I feel that Mr.Lucas should have left Mr.Shaw at the end of Return of the Jedi. It is almost like forgetting that Darth Vader turned away from the dark side and became part of the light in the end. Unfortionatly, my family no longer has our original VHS of RotJ due to over watching. It became so well worn with use that it would no longer play. I am deeply enamored of those who still have the pleasure of the original VHS, for I believe that to be the better rendition of a favorite movie of mine."
"This is where it all went wrong -way before the lame modern films. Return of the Jedi was lousy in almost every way a movie can be lousy. How did the following ""ideas"" not get thrown out on day one? -Have a climactic saber battle between Luke and Darth Vadar so someone can get their hand chopped off again. -Build a new deathstar so we can blow it up again. -Reveal that one of the good-guys is the child of one of the bad guys again.The script is awful, the directing is awful, the score is a witless mish-mash of the first two movies, Mark Hamil couldn't act, Harrison Ford had long since forgotten the difference between the Han Solo and Indiana Jones... I could go on and on but I don't want to think about it anymore. God, it was just... awful!"
"If you enjoy movies that look as though a bunch of people randomly threw on some old clothes and masks and began mumbling then this movie is perfect for you. Maybe they had a low budget- if so then I apologize for this review. However, if this is the producer's idea of comedy and sci-fi then he is way off base. This is not to say that the movie was a complete disappointment. Some scenes were quite humorous. I still cannot decide whether I was laughing at the wit of the script or laughing at the poor attempt at a fight scene. So far I am leaning towards the second one.IF you enjoy cheap looking sci-fi films I highly recommend this movie. If you are like me and would rather settle down with a more amusing movie I suggest you look elsewhere."
"Rented the DVD to see if I still found this movie to be as disjunct and trite as I thought it was in '83- it's worse than I remember. It does however warn us that the next two installments will hold together like a flimsy umbrella in a typhoon.As everyone agrees- the cute little animals (Ewoks) really get under your skin and lower this action/sci-fi to Muppets in Space territory. Little did we know that we'd be begging for the Ewoks after meeting Jar Jar Binks in Episode 1 and 2. The plot of the trilogy begins to convolute during this movie, and the ""Days of our Lives come back from the dead"" device is exploited like a bad Vegas stripper."
"What's wrong with this movie?1. Ewoks. I mean come on!!! The Empire that terrorized the galaxy and can destroy an entire planet with a single laser blast can be defeated by cute little teddy bears armed with sticks and stones? Ewoks were an obvious merchandising ploy. It's a damned shame Lucas sold out his masterpiece saga to sell a few cheap toys.2. Luke. He's no longer the young wide eyed panicky novice we knew him as in the first two. He now plays a Mr Migagi like character who talks like he's reading a fortune cookie. ""Your overconfidence is your weakness"" is a perfect example. 3. Han Solo. The man who played vital roles the first two movies is now reduced to comic relief with a few unfunny wisecracks. And I'm no military expert, but how can he go from a self centered smuggling scoundrel barfly who wanted nothing to do with the rebellion against the empire to a general overnight? 4. Luke and Darth. They were furiously swinging light sabers at each other in the previous film but are now calling each other ""Father"" and ""My son""? And when Luke said ""I know there's good in you"". Really Luke? He murdered your mother, mentor/teacher, aunt & uncle, your buddy Biggs, the entire planet of Alderann, and many of your rebel colleagues. He also froze your buddy Han after he tortured him for no reason, and he chopped off your hand. Where exactly do you see the ""good"" in him?5. Darth Vader. The dark, menacing, most bad ass villain in movie history is now a cowering wimp in front of the emperor. Until the end of course.6. Jabba the hut. This ugly wormlike blob who laughs like santa claus with a hangover and speaks some orcish language but always manages to throw about two or three English words into each sentence. ""ME WONG UGH DOOG MA ZUL GUV OLD JEDI MIND TRICK"".7. Boba Fett. This lurking villain has little dialogue in the whole series and none at all in ""Return"" so why is he even in this saga? Just to end up a burp joke? What a waste.8. The Sarlac Pit. OK first of all, who lives to be a thousand? And secondly, with no oxygen in it's belly, they'd probably be dead in less than an hour. ""Slowly digested in over a thousand years""? Wow, just like when you eat a bagel. 9. The Luke/Leia sibling thing. OK George. It worked in ""Empire"" when you shocked your audience with Darth Vader announcing he's Luke's father. But the Luke/Leia thing was an obvious attempt for a second shocking but it missed this time. Don't you remember they tongue kissed each other on Hoth?10. The Death Star. Where's your originality George?"
"The Return of the Jedi was George Lucas's last Star Wars film for 16 years, until he followed it up with the disappointing prequel The Phantom Menace in 1999. At the time that I am writing this review, Episode II has come out and proved that George Lucas is still able to produce an action packed space adventure (although he also proves that he is relying far too much on computer generated effects), and we are eagerly awaiting the release of Episode III in 2005, the film which has more possibilities than any of the Star Wars films since the original in 1977. The Return of the Jedi is the film in which we are introduced to the hideous Jabba the Hutt for the first time, as well as a score of other repugnant creatures. When I first watched this film, the first thing that struck me was an enormous increase in the level of gruesomeness that is seen in the creatures in the film. In the first film, even the antagonist creatures were at least mildly pleasant, but now we see Jabba, we see Jabba's disgusting sidekick with the snake things growing out of his head and around his neck, that tooth-riddled pit in the ground, as well as scores of other sickening things. We also get to the first glimpses of the badly damaged Death Star, whose post-explosive appearance is probably even more famous as an image in film history than its original appearance.  The Death Star is the focus of much of the conflict in the film. The Rebellion is making an elaborate attempt to destroy the Death Star, a nearly impossible excursion that involves timing an attack perfectly so that star-fighters can make an internal attack on the Death Star at just the right moment that their rebel partners are on a nearby planet, shutting down the defense mechanism that the Death Star is deriving from it. Clearly, this is not going to be an easy thing to do, and the majority of the film presents the efforts to get all of the forces coordinated to pull this task off, with the ultimate climax occurring as the rebel attack coincides with the revelation that the Death Star is fully functional as a weapon despite massive damage (a little secret they have tactfully decided not to reveal), and that they are already aware of the impending attack and more than capable of squishing all of the attackers like a lot of space-bugs. 
Great story, I think. And it's a good thing, too, because there were at least a few other things that I was less than impressed with about this particular installment in the Star Wars saga. The Ewoks, for example, just didn't strike me as something that belonged in a Star Wars film. I am more than willing to accept them, if for no other reason than the fact that they are now one of the more recognizable things from the old Star Wars films (although it seems like there are thousands of recognizable things from the old Star Wars films), but there were several battle scenes that failed to generate much excitement due to all of the cuddly little snuggle bears running around. Besides that, the Ewok costumes were some of the least impressive outfits in any Star Wars film to this day. You could almost see the seams along the sides, the faces were about as realistic as any stuffed animal, and the pads of the feet, which occasionally were in view, were just as toy-like. They were little more than cheap Halloween costumes.
On the other hand, the rest of the film is so entertaining that I am willing to forgive things like this. It's 1983, for crying out loud, so I'm not about to downgrade the movie for something like that, even though both of its predecessors had universally better costumes despite being older films. It's clear throughout the film that we are watching the conclusion of the conflict between the Imperial Forces and the Rebellion that we saw develop in the last two films, which is why it does not quite reach the same level of stupendous excitement and entertainment of them. There are a lot of fascinating characters and creatures introduced here, and some of the battles scenes in space far surpass anything in Star Wars or The Empire Strikes Back, but despite the fascinating story, there is just too much an element of conclusion and tying up loose ends for this movie to be as fresh and exhilarating. There is great concern in the last act of the movie with the metaphorical presentation of the dark side and the, well, the light side, I guess. Maybe the bright side? Yeah, the bright side, that sounds better. The dark side and the bright side. Luke is being held captive by Darth Vader and the Emperor and being forced to watch his friends careen helplessly into a battle, unaware that they have no chance of winning. As this happens, we are just itching to see Luke go for that light saber and strike someone down with it and do something heroic, but then the Emperor starts trying to convince him to do this. He encourages Luke to give in to his anger and officially become part of the dark side. It's easy to see how Vader was seduced by the dark side, if all it takes is the killing of someone that you bitterly hate because they are forcing you to watch the deaths of your friends. Throughout the entire Star Wars saga, one of the things that I always wondered about was how exactly Vader was seduced by the dark side, and in this scene I found myself seduced by it because I so badly wanted to see Luke do exactly what the Emperor was asking him to do. 
Clearly, the story of The Return of the Jedi leaves very little to be desired, with the exciting battles that come from the struggle between the Rebels and the Empire, and with Luke's struggles against the dark side as well as his interaction with Vader as Vader lay dying in his arms (another heavily metaphorical representation of the dark and bright sides). And despite a few elements of the film that prevent it from really rising to the level of quality and pure entertainment that it could have risen to, this is a powerful installment in the Star Wars saga. Given the relatively cheesy end that we saw in this film, with all of our heroes partying and hugging at an Ewok party in the woods (and with Luke giving the stereotypical grin to the ghostly images of Obi Wan and Yoda and the image of his father before he became Darth Vader (?)), I am curious about the future of the Star Wars saga. I've heard rumors about the production of Episodes VII, VIII, and IX, which seem a little far-fetched at this point, but it also seems almost as far-fetched that old George would end one of the greatest film sagas of all time with the closing scene of The Return of the Jedi."
"As the concluding section of the Star Wars trilogy, Return of the Jedi is quite disappointing. Most of the same characters from the first two films appear again, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Darth Vader and Chewbacca, but somehow they don't have the same impact as they did before.The main problems with Return of the Jedi are the general tone and the uneven script. The film is at its best when at its darkest, but unfortunately the film is less dark overall than the original Star Wars, let alone The Empire Strikes Back. Most of the film's best scenes are those featuring Emperor Palpatine, who is finally seen in the flesh for the first time. He exudes a believable aura of malevolence, and many of his scenes are electrifying (no pun intended).Return of the Jedi is hampered by an over-abundance of set pieces, which are entertaining enough while on screen but don't do enough to advance the plot, and are quickly forgotten as our heroes move on to tackle the next leg of their adventure.Unfortunately, a large chunk of the film is spent on Endor with the Ewoks. The appearance of these small furry creatures indicates that Return of the Jedi is aiming for a younger demographic than before, but in doing so it sacrifices much of the cross-generational appeal the series used to have.Return of the Jedi marks the point at which the Star Wars series began to lose its way. It undoubtedly has some memorable sequences, but there are also long sections where it becomes boring (yep, the Ewoks), an accusation that couldn't be levelled at the first two films. Viewed on its own terms, or compared with the more recent Star Wars films, Jedi's faults can be forgiven, but as part of the original trilogy it really should have been better."
"The cutesy Ewoks alone drag this disappointment into the gutter, but wait, there's more! Boba Fett's embarrassing death, the teddy-bear behind Darth Vader's mask, Chewbacca's Tarzan yell (is there a more efficient way of totally destroying my belief in the events of the film?), unfunny hijinks in the Ewok village...ugh. If not for the confrontation between Luke, Vader, and the Emperor, I would have given this a zero, were it possible. Too bad the Millennium Falcon wasn't destroyed in the final cut; it would have given at least a little weight to this utter anticlimax."
"Every time I tell people how horrible I thought Return of the Jedi was they give me this puzzled look and say, ""but it's Return of the Jedi! You can't hate Return of the Jedi!"" However, this movie really bothers me every time I see it. The creativity of the first Star Wars made it a great movie, and the shocking twist in Empire made it quite possibly the greatest sequel ever. Yet this incredible scenario presented at the end of Empire was wasted in a movie full of rehash. First of all, could Lucas really come up with nothing better than a SECOND Death Star??! And just like the first one, the movie ended in an all out assault on it. Luke and Vader fought with light sabers (again!). Not to mention, in a desperate attempt to recapture the emotion created in the audience after Vader said his famous ""I AM YOUR FATHER"", Lucas made Leia turn out to be Luke's long-lost sister. Give me a break! A little competition between Han and Luke might show some semblance of conflict among the good guys. Just because it's sci-fi doesn't mean it can't be somewhat realistic in character presentation. Vader's unmasking was disappointing. Instead of Lon Chaney unmasked as the phantom, we got Uncle Fester with acne. Carrie Fischer can't act worth $#\&*! Although I could go on and on, I'll give just one final reason. Three words: Ewoks! Ewoks! Ewoks! I hate those furry little muppet wannabes. They were added for one reason and one reason only, so Lucas could line his pockets by making Ewok stuffed animals, talking Ewok toys, Ewok lunchboxes, and even an Ewok TV show! The bottom line is, this is the most OVERRATED movie in the history of Hollywood!!!"
"""Return of the Jedi"" is almost on par with the previous ""Star Wars"" films. There's more special effects (some good, some cheesy) and more new characters and creatures, including the Ewoks.  What makes Jedi the least perfect, is that it's very routine -- more of a reworking of ""Star Wars."" There's more new surprises, though.  A victory is celebrated at the end.  New scenes are featured in the ""special edition."" The ending is very satisfying.  My evaluation: ***1/2 out of ****."
"Spoilers: I remember looking so forward to this as a kid after loving the first two movies. They had previews for new characters on the back of the action figures boxes I'd get at Toys-R-Us and I'd eagerly wonder what the blacked out Ewok characters would look like. Must have really been something special! I even remember how they switched the name around as ""Revenge of the Jedi."" This was just going to be THE movie of the summer, and waiting in line to get in while hearing the thunderous noise of the climactic battle as the audience of the screening just wrapping up applauded enthusiastically, I was just SO excited. When I saw it even as a kid I knew it was somewhat of a disappointment, watching it now as an adult...Uhgg! Now I see how Lucas went so wrong with the abomination of the prequels, all the threads started to unravel with this Turkey. (Though Return of the Jedi is still much superior to those aforementioned prequels which had a plot harder to follow than Dune.) First of all are notoriously unbearable Ewoks, even as a kid I HATED them. No adult could possibly find anything watchable about the whole Ewok sequence on Endor. The Emperor is ridiculously ""comic book"" evil, tyrants usually have charisma and are more like gangsters than lunatics. The choice to add another family revelation by making Leah Luke's sister is stupid and ruins the relationship from the first two movies. The original Cantina scene with the various aliens was creative, here Lucas has gone overboard with a new bizarre rubber masked actor or puppet cropping up every minute. In some respects this whole thing is nothing more than a commercial to sell action figures to eight year olds. And the Climax: Another Deathstar? Lucas, you already did that before, but considering the fecal ideas he spewed out in the prequels, perhaps a rehashing of the end of the first movie was the best we could hope for. After all, to sum up the cinematic ideas going through Lucas' head during this period: Howard the Duck. Don't even get me started on the vandalism Lucas did to the Original Trilogy with the CGI additions to the new copys of the Star Wars movies for sale. The original 1977 print is a piece of American History, to alter the imagery that swept the nation that summer is akin to someone painting over the Mona Lisa.Still Return of the Jedi it did have it's moments. The Jabba the Hut character is ubiquitously reknown and to this day everyone knows what your talking about if you refer to any gluttonous tard as ""Jabba the Hut."" The chase scene through the Redwoods is also quite memorable although the excitement came to a quick end with the ridiculously infantile Ewok scenes beginning moments later. The final showdown between Luke and Vader was also a glimpse of what this movie could have been had the same people who worked on The Empire Strikes Back had control over this thing. On the whole, a disappointing, childish end to the first two movies."
"I love the first two Star Wars movies of the original trilogy but I'm not a fan of Return Of The Jedi. One of the reasons why Empire Strikes Back is so great was because of how complex and deep with characters and story. Story and characters take a backseat in Return Of The Jedi to action and Ewoks which seem like a heavy handed attempt to capitalize on the younger audience and toy sales. It has some great ideas that are not properly executed. The action and special effects as well as practical effects are very good, and how Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader's story arcs were completed is the best part of the film. But it had potential to be more."
"never has a sequel much less the third installment of a trilogy ever captured the hearts and minds of the people of an age as well as the ""definitive vision"" of george lucas' star wars: return of the jedi. some so-called ""fans"" of star wars dare to call this the least effective of the trilogy; they argue that everything was too simply resolved. to these overstressed cynics and self-proclaimed critics i ask simply: have you ever actually sat down with a bucket of popcorn in your lap and a pepsi in your hand and just enjoyed the greatest science fiction movie, if not the greatest movie of all times. the final resolution between luke and his estranged father could not have been portrayed any better than it was. luke ""found"" the good in anakin long after all else had given up on him. also, the scene in which luke severed vader's hand and looked at his own robotic hand caused him to recall the lesson he had learned in the dagoba system in ""the empire strikes back""; he had learned in the cave as he faced the imaginary vader that if he struck out of fear and hate vader's fate would become his own. the unmasking of darth was the perfect solution. lucas took the ominous and evil vader and, by removing his helmet, exposed a vulnerable and kind man.Finally, in response to certain dogmatists' complaints that all conflicts are settled to perfectly, this is only because of george lucas' incredibly ingenious plot and plot line that without effort or omission of theme finalized itself in a most incredible manner. One must also remember that this movie and movies like it are, in literary terms, considered ""escape fiction,"" which, unlike ""thematic fiction,"" centers itself around plot. in escape fiction the watcher, reader, or listener expects to ""get away"" into another time, place, or even universe, and when the spectator puts himself in the position of the hero he doesn't like it to end in a negative way.in summary, if you don't like happy endings go read hemingway; however, if you enjoy action-filled, thought-provoking, suspense-building, adrenaline-pumping sagas with visual effects and plot-lines that paved the way for science fiction as we know it. go out right now and rent or buy the greatest movie of all time: Star Wars VI: The Return of the Jedi."
"This movie wastes what was a great villain in Boba Fett,and Harrison Ford's Han Solo character is hardly used.In 'The Empire Strikes back',Han Solo was a captain and yet now he is suddenly a General(?)as is Billy Dee Williams character who wasn't even in the army.This is bad writing and makes the film look amateurish.Luke Skywalker's main strategy is to get captured and then fight his way out(pretty silly writing).And the teddy bears,with their spears and stones,defeat the villain's army which is armed with heavy weapons.This is a very disappointing finale,not well written and the characters are wasted."
"This film is how Star Wars should be carried out. Great characters and great serious story line. No comedy in this luke the new films and real Jedi powers that have taken training to learn..
This film is fantastic and Disney has a lot to learn. I loved it and to me it's the best Star Wars film."
"Thanks to Kevin Smith, a bunch of geeks are running around saying that Return of the Jedi isn't any good because it's actually fun to watch.  And oh no!  Muppets are involved!  That makes it bad!  Everyone liked Return of the Jedi until someone in a Kevin Smith movie made a negative comment about it.  Now all of a sudden people people look at you like you have some kind of disease if you mention how much you like it.  This movie is so much better than anything Kevin Smith ever even considered creating that it boggles my mind that the man would even think of denouncing it.  This movie is good fun!  It's just as awesome as I remember it being when I was six! Enjoy this movie for what it is and stop stealing Kevin Smith's opinions! His aren't correct!And that Ewok song at the end ruled!  I bet you people don't even enjoy ""Ewoks: Battle for Endor""!!!!  I'm going to set you all on fire!"
"It really does suck getting old sometimes...you end up doing things like re-watching 'Return of the Jedi' and realizing, ""Wow, this movie kinda sucks."" Actually, it's pretty damn terrible. Han Solo is completely different - pure comic relief, only not funny at all. I'm a little bummed actually. I loved this movie when it came out back in '83 and was very excited to revisit it. As I sat here watching it my heart just kept sinking lower and lower. Is this the same movie I saw in the theatres?? What's up with all the cutesiness? And the myriad issues extend far beyond the infamous and very problematic Ewoks. The whole thing is just cheeseball bad. It's very poorly put together - poorly edited throughout, Boba Fett's demise is cartoonishly out of place, did I mention Han Solo is a complete waste of space? I could go on and on and on. I mean wow, George Lucas jumped the shark 30 years ago! The Phantom Menace was simply a continuation of the already declining quality. I'm sitting here in a state of quiet, disappointed shock."
"We spent years growing up with Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back.. and waited for the super finale. Then Spielberg releases this junk clearly aimed at an audience 8-12 yrs. Cute cuddly creatures beating up on trained soldiers??  Gimme a break."
"The STAR WARS films are a hallmark of our culture. Everyone who wants to study film should see them, because they display quite accurately how not to make a movie, and in particular how not to write a script. I cannot even express how much is wrong is these movies, in every possible respect. Obviously they are cynically manufactured with money in mind (Ewoks!? C'mon!), and obviously they wrecked the notion of film as anything but lightweight, even dull and stupid, entertainment. What even some of the series' detractors fail to see is how awful the movies would be with or without the hype.Let's start with the acting. I can't believe anyone ever took Mark Hamill seriously; meanwhile, Harrison Ford's attempts at emotion are downright laughable. Carrie Fisher does what she can, but like everyone else, she's saddled with some unspeakable dialogue. Far more offensive is the storyline that runs through the three films (and presumably the three prequels as well). You tell me with a straight face that no loser thirteen year-old who reads sci-fi comics couldn't come up with this tripe, and I will applaud you. George Lucas has created a masturbatory set of films in a remarkably self-indulgent attempt to take advantage of the notoriety he achieved with AMERICAN GRAFFITI. Let's not beat around the bush, these movies have one of the dumbest plots ever transferred to celluloid. ""The Force""? Wow, talk about covering your tracks... to try to avoid plot holes, Lucas creates this invisible dimension that can let people do anything, like pick up out-of-reach objects (as seen in the remarkable ""Luke retrieves a Kenner toy which you could go buy right now from the snow while he hangs upside down"" scene, the stuff of great cinema, in the second film). How exciting. I'd like to have a Force in my house so I won't have to get up to change the TV channel when this idiotic movie comes on.The script? Don't even get me started. To be frank, what little plot there is doesn't make much sense. And talk about episodic! It's just one toy commercial after another, from the completely pointless ""speeder-bike"" scene to the seemingly endless chunk of partying from the Care Bears or whatever those things were. Any fan page or even the IMDB will hold a nice collection of ludicrous quotes, and the fans will probably shiver with glee, while I sit and gawk at how a screenplay with no trace of talent to be found can gain the respect of millions. Most offensively, you've got a score that screams and manipulates like a sitcom laugh track or a Nazi anthem (but then, John Williams never offered anything but recycled schmaltz to start with).In essence, I remain fascinated by the fact that more people have seen this than will sit through the infinite number of films that have more imagination and emotion in a single second than the entire ""Star Wars"" series can muster. The worst part is, if you issue any kind of a dissenting opinion on this boring junk, a million raging fanboys will assault you for not showing the proper degree of worship to a supposed American classic. Jonathan Rosenbaum said in 1997 that destroying every print of the Star Wars films wouldn't solve any of the problems caused by them, but that he wouldn't shed a tear at the loss. I would agree. I don't claim to have any authority over anyone's love of the series, and if you genuinely love these films, that's great. I just don't understand why those who disagree are so frequently labeled ""flamers."" I apologize for not wanting my brain to turn to mush.My rating: 0/10"
"This third of the original Star Wars films is probably my weakest. Possibly because the writing is not too tight but for me, more so because the Ewoks take over the thing and they are just stupidly annoying. What had potential to pitch the ultimate evil partnership again the Rebel Alliance became a toy-fight straight out of a Laurel and Hardy comedy - the storyline was infantile. Still a great film to look at, and enough menace and diversion in the first hour to make it well worth watching."
"The rise of this movie on the top 250 - and the praise it receives - is as baffling to me as anything.While Star Wars (1977) is overrated in my view, it is still nonetheless a good film. This movie, on the other hand, is little more than mediocre. The first 35 minutes is spent on a drawn out rescue mission that is stretched to the point of tedium and has maybe 3 interesting or noteworthy moments. That's an entire third of the movie wasted on something that should've taken half the time. How anyone can call the opening of 'Revenge of the Sith' too long while defending this is anyone's guess.After that, we get some truly cringe dialogue and character interactions that make no sense. The one that hits you in the face like a sledgehammer is the relationship between Lando and Han Solo. Like, okay, I could understand Han forgiving Lando for what happened in episode 5, but for God's sake *actually include the forgiveness scene.* Han doesn't even seem to care that Lando was the reason why HE WAS TORTURED. They become instant best buddies chumming it up out of nowhere. It's like he's saying ""Hey man, I know you screwed us over and almost got us all killed before, but oh well boys will be boys amirite?""As for the climax, the space battle is pretty good, and the scenes between Vader, Luke, and the Emperor are the best parts of the movie by far. The fight against the Empire on Endor, on the other hand, is bloody awful. There are exactly 0 stakes in anything, and we essentially get a pack of teddy bears beating up the empire by throwing rocks. There's no tension, and the ""struggle to win"" is played as a joke.How is this the 80th best movie ever made? I bet you there are 10 thousand better films than this one (at least!)
It seems as though only episode 5 actually deserves the praise it gets - that movie is legitimately great. The rest of the original trilogy falls well short of the God-tier quality people attribute to it - and episode 6 is the worst offender by far. It seems like this movie is playing with house money; and not in any positive way where the story takes some risks. Instead, it feels as though not enough effort is put into this, and very poor writing choices are made with far too much confidence. This is a movie that doesn't attempt to hide its flaws, they are all out in the open and blatant - as if the bad writing was intentional."
"Return of the Jedi is a fun and pleasant movie, but adds little to the Star Wars universe in the way of novel ideas or character investment (arguably Anakin aside). The movie runs along two storylines: the darker Luke storyline of him becoming a Jedi and confronting his father, and the lighter storyline of Han and Leia continuing to be in love and work with the Ewok. The latter storyline was cute, but utterly uneventful. Nothing new happens with Han or Leia, and the Ewoks are given far too much screentime for their one-dimensionality as just cute and somewhat strong things, so that storyline ended up being rather boring. The Luke one definitely held more tension - the late scenes with him, Vader, and Palpatine were exciting and built well to the climax. Unfortunately, that climax was quite a disappointment, for several reasons. First, unlike the previous one, we get little in the way of Luke's character development and have little reason to be invested in or root for him. Second, Luke's ability to hold his own with Vader and Palpatine was unrealistic - why not pout some physical restrictions on him until he agrees to serve you? But the biggest frustration is what the plot hinges on: Vader's transition to help Luke. Luke doesn't really do or say anything novel, and Vader is a smart guy who has thought about this issue long and hard, and yet Luke being there is enough to just get him to switch? Vader is so deeply established and has been working as a head of the Empire for years, a conviction that should not be so easily shaken. He didn't raise his son but left him at birth, so there's hardly even a huge familial connection. We aren't given anything to latch on to in explaining Vader's monumental shift. Between the lack of interest in the other storylines and the disappointment in the way the climax is resolved, the pleasant effects, acting, and other peripherals present in all three are not enough to save Return of the Jedi from fun but easily forgettable mediocrity."
"This movie was lame. Many people treat the original ""trilogy"" as a monolith but in fact the fist two movies were great and all of the rest were disappointing. This one gets undeserved points because it came soon enough to feed off of the good will from the earlier ones, but in reality it is more like all of the subsequent ones.If the ""speeder bikes"" that speed between the trees can levitate, then why can't they levitate above tree level? Oh, because that would make too much sense. And the Empire that we've come to know as nearly invincible and galaxy-threatening can be beaten by little stuffed animals with sticks and stones?! It has become an exploitative franchise turning out silly product, eating away at the legacy of A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back. This third installment begins the decline.."
The Return of the Jedi was a movie that was hard to watch.I was a big fan of the first two movies and was very much looking forward to this one. The qualities that made the first two movies so good were missing from 'Jedi'. The plot was unoriginal. The story had nothing interesting or new. The actors seemed like they couldn't wait to get it over with. The new characters in the movie were very boring. It seemed like the target audience for this movie was 5 year-olds based on some of the work of the background actors in the opening act and by many of the other characters in the film. It seems like the movie was sloppily put together. There are only two scenes in the movie that interested me and it was not enough to overcome all the bad. I wanted to like this movie as I had the other two. An overall bad movie.
"Return Of The Jedi is the worst Star Wars film.Many may be surprised to hear this, but Return Of The Jedi is definitely the Star Wars film I enjoy the least. The film is hurt by the first third of the film, the rescue of Han Solo. It does nothing to proceed the plot, it's overly long, it's filled with ridiculous things (droid torturing) as well as unnecessary action scenes (Rancor fight) and prevents the film from dealing with more relevant stuff.Additionally, all characters except for Luke Skywalker are abandoned. Han Solo has become a caricature who gets nothing to do after he has been freed. Leia, who had potential, was let down by the writers and had to stay on Endor and become as redundant as Han Solo. Her family history has been wasted. The second Death Star is unoriginal and boring.Luke, the Emperor and the fate of Darth Vader are the only redeeming qualities of the film. But that's 30% at best.5 stars."
This movie is a bit disappointment after good New Hope and Empire strikes back. This movie has at the same time one of the best moments in Star Wars(emperor Palpatine) and worst(Ewoks). I personally didn't like Jabba the Hutt. It somehow made this movie look a bit comedy. But that wasn't the main reason. Ewoks made this movie bad.As for final battle that was disappointing too. The ground battle was terrible. Ewoks against stormtroopers. Ewoks didn't have any credibility but still Stormtroopers made to look like incompetent clowns..Ground battle was nothing like in the Empire strikes back.As for space battle. That was disappointing too. We didn't get too see what Star destroyer could do in the battle. Actually they didn't too anything. Even the Super Star destroyer was destroyed too fast and too easily. Best scenes in the battle were Luke and Vader scenes with the emperor. But even then light saber duel was not as great as in Empire strikes back.I hope we will get to see great space battles in Star Wars episode VII.
"I'm sitting with my 11 year old daughter and 5 yr. old son watching what they were sure was the mother of all Star Wars movies based on the hype of the most recent installment of the Star Wars saga, Revenge of the Sith. Once again I am appalled that this movie was made and worse, made money.Don't get me wrong, I loved the first Star Wars and respect it for the tour De force it was for the genre. Unfortunately, the rest are rubbish. The problem (and there are many), is that Muppets belong in Manhattan and not in a galaxy far far away.Jabba may work. His minions are crap. His pet, the worst. The guards look like rejects from The Dark Crystal. Most of these creatures should have surely bought the farm a millennium ago according to Darwin's theory. The acting during these scenes is so bad it makes soaps look like Shakespeare.Ewoks are the undying joke of this movie. The costumes are total crap. I would definitely not put ""Ewok costume designer"" on my resume. Their movement is that of midgets in furry costumes (political incorrectness intended) with casts on both legs. Darwin would have been out there clubbing Ewoks himself so as to not embarrass his natural selection theory. Again the acting in these scenes is terrible. Only Chewbacca has any credible acting in this portion of the movie.The rest of the film plays out as a regular B movie. Even the latest installments, with all of the latest special effects, are sabotaged by the stupidest characters (JarJar Binks) and terrible acting (Samuel L. Jackson, et Al), a running curse for these movies.Some say I'm over critical. I don't believe this. I am however, a stickler for details. A great movie, The Hunt for Red October, was ruined for me when the Russian under sea map had English in parenthesis, under the Cyrillic, cow towing to what the producers must feel are the more feeble minded viewers. If the actors say they are heading towards such and such a place, why wouldn't I assume that when they point to the map, in Russian or not, that this is not what they are talking about? I just think it's sad that I have to recommend Star Trek, Next Generation and the Aliens trilogy as the better examples of science fiction to my kids."
"Return of the Jedi is an example of a film that had to many changes before release.
Changing Chewbacca's planet to a teddy bear planet. removing Lucas's original idea of Luke going on a quest for revenge and replacing it with a reunion with daddy.
Jedi proves it's no simple task being a Star Wars film.
While the actors still give their all, the alien design is still good as are the landscapes.
It's the plot itself which kills it, not to mention some dumb character deaths (Boba Fett anyone?) Return of the Jedi lacked the darkness, depth and intensity of Empire.
I'll never be able to understand how anyone can rate this 9 or 10 stars. It's just plain bad.
I don't recommend it, it's a terrible ending to the original trilogy."
"Ok, strike me down with a lightsabre, Jedi-freaks, but I could barely watch this. Why? Spoiler Alert! First of all, EWOKS! Brr...they certainly aren't as bad as Jar-Jar Binks but close enough. I personally think they were created to appeal to girls because Star Wars is more of a guy trilogy. I mean, Princess Leai is in some wooded area on some planet or whatever, and she sees these oversized teddy bears running around in what appears to be bandanas and sling-shots. What? Where? Who? But what really insulted my mind about the Ewoks was that they were able to kill Vaders henchmen (what were they again?) with stones and arrows while the henchmen are wearing hard plastic and metal. What?Oh yeah, and the ending. Vader supposedly becomes a good guy. What? And his face is powder white as I remember it. So, going to the Dark Side pales your face? Was that caused from the lack of light in his helmet or was that supposed to be suspicion of disbelief, or the mystery of science in Star Wars? Well you tell me, how could something like that be Mystery of Science in Star Wars? It isn't even in the same theme as the other MOSISWs, nor even in suspicion of disbelief. It's just idiocy that Lucas thinks the fans will call a MOSISW. Why? Because MOSISWs are words like midicholorines (sp?) or what's going on, they aren't supposed to be of your skin going pale. Or can they be? I dunno. Big hole there.Yoda dies. C'mon, Lucas, he has only been friends with Luke for half an episode, you should have made Episodes 7-9 where he would have been a more devolped friend/Jedi-instructor for Luke. Hell, Luke didn't even finish his Jedi training by this episode well enough to really call him a Jedi. Show Luke as a full experienced Jedi for more than a quarter episode, and Yoda needed to be more devolped in the originals.I could go on but I'll stop here.Nice effects though.4/10"
"I have always been sad that the Trilogy ended with such a weak effort. There are so many things wrong with Jedi symbolically, story-wise and even from a design point of view that I could write a book. All those die-hards (and believe me, I am included in that category in every respect except for this deviation) who proclaim this to be equal or better to the other two are only kidding themselves. Star Wars was genius, Empire was a masterpiece, but Jedi was a pathetic attempt to wrap it all up into a happy, marketable package for the fans."
"The first time you watch this flick, its not too bad. The flaws really start to show themselves when you watch it again. Kids who watch this, though, will love it simply because its star wars.Darth Vader was boring and two-dimensional. He wasn't menacing, merely a second hand fiddle to the Emperor who was by far more sinister. His age really shows when he battles with an also-aged looking Luke! I actually winced when he deliberately threw himself down so Luke could really give his old man a hiding. Darth looked like he'd put on a few pounds and was too tired to put up a good fight! Maybe he needed to do a few aerobics classes!The cast seemed bored with their roles. Dialogue was hokey. Felt like I was watching a typical Disney flick with typical Disney dialogue. Again, much cringing as the large cast simply 'goes through the motions'.Cliches abound.EWOKS!!!!! Amongst the worst movie creatures I have seen: but not quite as bad as Jar Jar Binks. How could these ridiculous furry toys wipe out a highly advanced Imperial navy that employs walking tanks, flying bikes and space stations that blow up planets - with a few stones, wooden clubs and slings????It was dumbed down for the enjoyment of the little kids in the audience. The addition of cuddly cutesy pooh bears was obviously for the entertainment of toddlers. Mr Lucas aimed this flick primarily at the youngest movie-goers, to the detriment of older audiences (those over the age of 8).The franchise has grown woefully tired. Mr Lucas intended the awful Ewoks as torture devices to be used by kids to force their parents into buying everything Ewok for them!CONCLUSION? Well, it WAS better than Phantom Menace...."
"this one lacked a certain edge that the other two had. not to mention that ""Luke, I Am Your Father"" was a lot better than ""Leia's My sister!"" that was just plain silly, not to mention as to how Leia reacted to that. was that the same Princess Leia that said classic lines like: ""I'd rather Kiss A Wookie!""? that was one of the wussiest displays of emotions I have ever seen. The Lightsaber Battles just weren't as intense as in Empire Strikes Back, and the death Star II.  Ha! Like we haven't seen THAT before, and those Ewoks! Man, what a dumb Idea! Living Teddy Bears? what Kind of Allies are that?"
"Several months ago, a friend of mine and I sat down and watched the special edition trilogy of Star Wars films. Not surprisingly, the original I still consider to be one of my favorite films of all time... unfortunately, the same cannot be said of Return of the Jedi (although Empire actually seemed a LOT better than I remember).Both of us were shocked at how truly bad a film this is. The blatant catering to kids is just one of the short-comings (albeit probably the most annoying), but the awful acting of Harrison Ford, the terrible dialogue, the poor storyline all add up to a movie which really doesn't stand the test of time and growing up.Does it matter?  Not really... Star Wars is still my favorite film... it's just sad when those old memories just don't quite seem to hold up."
"I am baffled by the high ratings this film has received. It is actually quite weak, suffering from poor directing, a weak script with stupid (not corny) dialog and improbable situations. Enter the Ewoks, and the whole series ends in a blaze Toys-R-Us glory. The only story line of interest is the one pitting Luke against his father, but unfortunately Mark Hamill is not up to the task. The script calls for him to mourn the loss of Yoda, appeal to a (supposedly) conflicted Vader, fearlessly face the Emporer, be the matured, slightly aloof Jedi to his swashbuckling Solo and Calrisian, but until the very end, when Hamill finally pulls out all the stops, it is simply difficult to accept him as a mature jedi knight. The final fight between Luke, Vader and the Emporer is well-staged and beautifully shot. Unfortunately, one must traverse a lot of goofy material to get there, beginning with Jabba the Hut, who is wonderfully realized but his den of thieves and vagrants comes across more as a children's version of Ali Baba. The standout performance is Dave Prowse/James Earl Jones as Darth Vader, while Carrie Fisher is obviously looking forward to wrapping the series and getting on with her career, as it were. But enough. This film does not warrant deep analysis. A disappointing ending to what could have been one of the most compelling film series in historic. After 20+ years it still hurts."
"After The Empire Strikes Back, which built masterfully on the success of the first Star Wars film -- deepening characters, fleshing out the universe in grand and dramatic space-opera fashion, and adding more ambitious themes about the true nature of heroism -- Return is a significant letdown.On the plus side: it has some enjoyable action sequences and fun special effects. Also, particularly with some brief scenes added at the end after the prequels were made, it manages to do a respectable job of drawing the narrative threads to a close.On the minus side: the Jabba the Hutt episode at the beginning is overstuffed with wacky creatures that are not as interesting as the filmmakers seem to think, and is simply not compelling enough to justify all the space it takes up. (Princess Leia's infamous slave girl costume during these sequences, however, does get the fan-boy seal of approval.) The principle aliens that show up later on are too cutesy to take seriously, especially when they suddenly 'get religion' at a critical point in the narrative. Perhaps most disappointing, the beginnings of a deeper and more challenging characterization of Luke from Empire seem to have been largely abandoned in favor of rather slapdash moral drama. When the forces of evil try to trap Luke in an emotional vice near the end of the film, they are so heavy-handed and obvious about it that it's quite hard to take them as seriously as the logic of the story seems to demand. (I have a similar problem with Darth Vader's conversion to the Dark Side in Revenge of the Sith, although that film has a far more convincing tone overall.)If you're just in it for the gosh-wow, and love the wacky critters, you'll probably enjoy it. It does also feature the Millennium Falcon, which has to count for something.But, yes, in case you are wondering, I find even The Phantom Menace to be a significantly deeper, more compelling, and overall much more enjoyable science fantasy film experience. Give me Jar-Jar over Ewoks (they were supposed to be Wookies, dang it!) any day of the week. Besides, Menace has Qui-Gon, the most spectacularly pointless fusion power plant in the history of cinema (or whatever it is -- but notice how similar it looks to the interiors of the Death Star and to the underbelly of the Cloud City, also settings for crucial light-saber duels; I believe Lucas has dreams of this place), and an evil emperor (to be) who is a convincingly diabolical threat to everything good in the universe."
"Even when I saw it in the theaters as a kid, I thought this was a bit silly. Sappy stuff with the Ewoks, overlong, new creatures not that fantastical (Jabba), an emphasis on the chase scene over the dramatic thrust, a bit of self-importance, and a touch of weariness - the actors look tired and bored, as if publicly greating each other is the way to get audience cheers. Carrie Fisher really needs to quit smoking - sounds like they have too many Marlboros on that planet.  Mark Hammill is starting to look, well, not-so-good.  Not bad overall, but a clear sign of decline - not as precipitous as the next installment, but the first crack in the Jedi's armor."
"The first half of this movie is exceptional.  The second half-however, presages the current, slow demise of the series.  It is here we see the first ever 1 hour theatrical commercial.  The series looses all cohesiveness, the characters become far too trite, and marketing takes place above all else.  C'mon George, make movies, not commercials.  On a scale of 1-10, 5 for the first half, 0 for the second half, for a total of 5 pts."
"What can I say? Return of the Jedi is the second best movie ever made (Next to The Empire Strikes Back) It has everything, good special effects, good acting, interesting story line, and most of all, it is the conclusion to the STAR WARS TRILOGY. One warning, if you see this movie get the original edition (It's much better) and invite the entire family. From the E-Walks to Jaba the Hut you will not be able to leave this movie for a second. So that is why I give it 10 out of 10"
This is my favorite episode. It feels magical and big and epic. The ending scenes and celebrations with the force ghosts are full of heart and jubilation. 10/10.
"The final episode starts with the most hilarious sequence of events you could come up with for a Star Wars movie. It's unnecessarily long, awkward, strange, convoluted and just ridiculous. It then continues on in this spirit, killing off interesting characters like they were nothing, showing off Luke's acquired strength at every turn (he's indestructible, but still seems like a clumsy kid), but that isn't to say this movie is bad. It's just not as good as the other entries in the franchise. What saves it is the storyline leading up to the final scene with Darth Vader, which is incredible. The rest of the movie isn't. The Ewoks especially are terrible. Not only do they look like puppets, they feel completely out of place. It's the only Star Wars movie during which you're taken completely out of the immersion by the movie itself, and it does this repeatedly, only to be saved at the last moment. Storm troopers are a joke."
"I thought this was a typical film ending for the 80's, the good guy always wins.But I thought the beginning seemed rather badly written if I'm honest.
Here Luke and Leia plan to rescue Han from Jabba on Tatooine.
Despite freeing Han the plan fails and is Leia captured, and when Luke appears he too is captured (and dropped into the Rancor pit to die) predictably Luke survives and kills the Rancor, then they are all sentenced to death at the Sarlac pit.
This however was all part of their plan as Lando, Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2-D2 were already in place to help them and turn their execution into an escape.
What kind of a rescue plan is expected to fail from the start?
I can understand having a plan b just in case, but everything about this shows they knew exactly how events would unfold, why else would they place Lando, Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2-D2 in Jabba's palace. How would they get them out if Han's rescue had been successful?Now a little controvential opinion, Ewoks.Han and his team go to destroy the shield generator on Endor in order to destroy the second Death Star, however before they can set charges to destroy the base an Imperial army then ambushed them and fight against the Rebels.
The fight soon turns to the Imperials advantage however the Ewoks then join the fight; using primitive catapults, trip ropes and stones they somehow defeat the Imperials and enable Han to destroy the shield generator.
The Ewoks seem like they were only placed in the film as a means of ensuring victory for the Rebels, the Imperials would have defeated the outnumbered Rebels were it not for them, and the idea that such primitive weapons could defeat the Imperial troops seemed a stretch anyway.Prior to this Luke left Hans team and allowed himself to be captured and taken to the Death Star to confront Palpatine and Vader where he is forced to fight Vader, Luke bests the Sith Lord however his compassion for Vader (after he revealed himself as his father) stops Luke from killing him. Instead he throws down his weapon and faces Palpatine unarmed.
Palpatine attacks Luke with his Force lightning however before he can kill Luke, Vader switchesd allegiance.
Driven by love for his son Vader lifts Palpatine and throws him down a chute into space and kills him, this act however damages his life support suit and soon after he too dies.
Vader seems like a very selfish man and an unreliable ally, having already turned on the Jedi in Episode III when he saw an opportunity to help himself (to save Padme) he again switches sides to save Luke.The Death Star is then destroyed, typically just as Luke escapes with Vaders body.
Luke then holds a private Jedi funeral on Endor attended by ghost Obi-Wan and ghost Yoda (the ghost of an old man then appears and is presumably Anakin) meanwhile everyone else has a pre-fight party in the Ewok village.
The remastered version is good how the head of the old man ghost is replaced with the head of Hayden Christiensen (who playes Anakin in the Prequel series, as this presumably depicts Anakin the last time he was a Jedi) But where is Qui-Gon who was hinted at being able to appear as a ghost to Obi-Wan while in hiding on Tatooine between the two trilogies?
In the remastered version they also show clips of worlds across the universe celebrating the destruction of the Emperor, which is odd since word cannot have spread that fast?"
"As a child, I owned all of the original Star Wars trilogy on VHS, purchased when 'remastering' was all the rage and the iconic sci-fi saga found itself on the receiving end of a much-needed cleaning-up. This was, however, before George Lucas tampered with his already- near-perfect legacy, adding unneeded special effects and elongating certain scenes for seemingly no other reason to show how far CGI had come (although it now looks incredibly dated). Despite the perfection of episodes four and five, my go-to Star Wars movie on a boring Sunday afternoon was always Return of the Jedi, the third instalment now widely remembered as the poorest of the bunch. I don't quite know what it was about Jedi that always caused me to reach for it. It certainly wasn't the Ewoks, those cuddly fur-balls shoe-horned in to sell more merchandise, although they aren't as annoying or distracting as I remembered.Jedi is most certainly the least effective of Lucas' creation, but there's still plenty of charm and excitement to solidify the entry as, at the very least, a satisfying closure to the saga, despite Disney's welcome efforts to further explore the Star Wars universe. The Empire Strikes Back broke up its characters but managed to keep a firm grasp on the various story-threads. Jedi does the same again, but is less successful at holding all the action together. Nevertheless, the characters get to enjoy an early reunion at Jabba the Hutt's palace on Tatooine, where the slug-like abomination hangs Han Solo (Harrison Ford), still frozen in his carbonite prison from the last movie. C- 3PO (Anthony Daniels), R2-D2 (Kenny Baker), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) all arrive at various intervals as part of a rescue operation, as does Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), the latter having completed his Jedi training and going about his business with a brooding confidence.A horrific car crash may have robbed Hamill of some of his boyish good-looks, but it did nothing to dampen his skills as an actor. Skywalker's newly-found intensity, which no doubt stems from his flourishing grasp on the Force and skill with a lightsaber, is matched by Hamill's execution. He stops by to see Yoda (Frank Oz), who confirms that Darth Vader is indeed his father and a fallen Jedi, and has a brief chat with the spirit of his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness). Skywalker's thread is by far the most interesting, inevitably heading towards a showdown with his father and the puppet-master behind the Empire, the rasping Emperor (Ian McDiarmid). Although Vader's brutality has been turned down as he plays lap-dog to his boss, audiences back in 1983 must have been holding their breath as the Emperor tortures Luke in an attempt to turn him to the Dark Side, and Vader is clearly shown to be wrestling with his allegiance.The rest of the action fares less well, as Han Solo and Leia find themselves captured by the community of Ewoks who seem to want to eat them, while C-3PO bares a close resemblance to the God the little critters worship. Their aim is to take down a generator controlling the energy shield of a brand new Death Star - yes, they have somehow managed to nearly complete a bigger, meaner planet- killer in a remarkably short space of time. Lando and the remaining Rebel Alliance are forced to repeat the climax of A New Hope, and while it's certainly a spectacular battle, it can't help but feel like more of the same. Jedi is best remembered as a series of memorable moments than a truly great film. It's easy to forget the film's messy narrative and cynical desire to boost merchandise sales, especially as a child, but it's hard to forget Leia in a gold bikini, Jabba's grotesque rat-like pet, the high-speed chase through the forests of Endor, or the shockingly crap death of fan-favourite Boba Fett. Nowhere near the annoying child-pandering misfire some believe it to be, but also some way off the magnificence of its predecessors."
"Star Wars - Episode VI - Return of the Jedi is not nearly as good as the first two, and is a slightly disappointing conclusion to a series that was doing so well. The acting is slightly better this time around, but the story is the major factor in its downfall.As aforementioned, the acting is much better than A New Hope, but only under-par to The Empire Strikes Back. The moments between Luke and Leia are nicely done, and Harrison Ford steals the show whenever he reappears.The music by John Williams is also sub-par compared to the first two. Not nearly as emotional as The Empire Strikes Back, nor new in themes, the score for The Return of the Jedi is a real miss.As always, the special effects are grand, though lackluster from the re-releases. Jabba is cool, and the various set designs are as well. The speeder-bike chase through the jungle is probably one of the best scenes in the franchise.The screenplay is the ultimate part in this film's disappointment. The character development, while fully realized, is very dull upon completion. To fans, Darth Vader's appearance under the mask will be a disappointment (it wasn't to me). The inclusion of Ewoks, while a nice idea, comes off as a foreshadowing factor for what will become The Phantom Menace. The action is poorly done, making the pace of the film suffer greatly.Overall, while an immense series, the final conclusion of the Star Wars saga is a minor letdown due to a lack in an exciting story. Some of the revelations are disappointing, and the action is less than engaging. The characters are in dull scenes, though fully developed as characters. I recommend it only to finish up the trilogy/saga, because it is still a well done film, it's just not going to meet expectations."
"In contrast to the prequels, the original series sees the 3rd installment to be the weakest of the bunch. After Darth Vader's dramatic revelations and the remarkable battle on Hoth, we delve into quieter, but not necessarily better times.Certainly the scenes of Han's rescue and the epic space battles are there, but they are peppered with the hideously annoying Ewoks, who take the film from a classic, almost serious endeavour to the domain of the cutesy. Certainly Lucas could have placed a more dignified race rather than one that worships C-3PO? O_o That quibble aside, however, ROTJ has plenty of classic moments, including the climactic assault on the incomplete Death Star, the duel between Vader and the Emperor, and also the scenes on Tattooine.A GOOD film, but not an EXCELLENT film like the first two."
"Luke (Mark Hamill), Leia (Carrie Fisher), Lando (Billy Dee Williams), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), C-3PO and R2-D2 go to Taooine to rescue Han Solo (Harrison Ford) from the powerful criminal Jabba the Hutt. After many fights, they are well succeeded in their mission. The group returns to the Rebel Alliance base while Luke heads to Dagobah to finish his training with Yoda; however the Jedi is dying and he confirms that Darth Vader (David Prowse) is his father and Luke also learns that he has a sister, Leia. Meanwhile the rebels discover that the Empire is building a new Death Star more powerful than the first one that is protected by an energy shield generated by a generator in planet Endor. Luke and his group goes to the forest in the planet to destroy the generator while Lando and the rebels wait for the right moment to attack the station. The group in Endor teams-up with the inhabitants, Ewoks, to fight against the Imperial troops but they are captured in a trap; Luke is brought to Darth Vader but he refuses to fight against his father. When he meets the Emperor (Ian McDiarmid), he tries to bring Luke to the dark side of the Force. What will happen to Luke and the rebels? ""Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi"" is the last episode of the fantastic saga. In 1983, this film was a sensation and now, in 2015, it has not lost the impact. On the contrary, now watching the episodes in sequence the viewer can see that George Lucas had the whole story in details in his mind. And now let's see the next episode. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""O Retorno de Jedi"" (""The Return of the Jedi"")"
"This could have been a great film and could have brought the Star Wars trilogy to a find end. Unfortunately, Hollywood had to bring in the Ewoks. Cute, furry, little singing and dancing critters who's only contribution to the film was to give the retailers something to sell really made the final installment of the star wars trilogy a film to be avoided. Had they simply left them as an alien race that helped Luke and his friends they would have been fine but Hollywood and the licensing groups got together and turned them into something entirely unnecessary. Unfortunately, the Ewoks caused this film to fall from what it could have been to what it ended up being: A commercial for action figures and teddy bears."
"After two forced film viewings I decided in for a penny in for a pounding.Painful.After learning of his heritage and escaping capture of the empire our hero decides That hiding and laying low is just not the right thing to do. So he decides that he should Like his father kill a big fat slug . Instead of going to the home and garden section of his Local store and purchasing rock salt , our hero decides that mounting a small war is what laying low looks like.After wisely giving advanced warning to his adversary our hero fires the fist shot gifting him two droids. As the operation moves forward Jabba decides that owing to the 1980s looming recession that staff cut backs are needed. The first to go the green exotic dancer whose salary is way to much. Especially with a half naked slave chained at your feet. The rancor found this decision shall we say ..tasty.Jabba after interviewing our hero decides to expedite him with a side of bacon to the prior mentioned rancor. Jabba's hopes are crushed as is the rancor ( to much iron in the diet maybe?). After that incident both the farm boy and the freezer blind Han are treated to Jabba's rancor. It is decided a feast will be held in their honor. They along with with the audience will be fed lame dialogue and unending cackles from a wingless bird.After the death of Jabba by choking our slave girl unfortunately misses the chicken. This is great fully our final stop on the planet not chosen for David lynch's dune. Our hero returns to the rainy jungle world that even Lt. Dan and Forrest Gump knew better than to explore to find a dying puppet. The puppet apologizes for lying to him claiming it was all in the script and that someone named Qui-Gon made him do it. After the BBQ , our hero returns to the fleet to discover that the rebellion was dumber than he ever suspected.The rebellion has placed all its hopes on a massive coordinated attack on the empires new floating tangerine , but before its slices congeal. Han solo it has been decided will be the mastermind of the key assault owing to his deft ability to be frequently captured by the empire.However things take a bizarre turn as our heroes attempt to lower the shield that protects the giant round "" pardon our dust"" station above the forest moon of Endor. That' s right forest moon . Not moon. Not inhabited moon . There are a lot of trees there and don't you forget that.And teddy bears don't forget the teddy bears. Such a wasted marketing opportunity what were the makers of Teddy Ruxpin thinking? Anyway after C3PO does his best post modern attempt at the robot stalker that followed will Robinson around (only with a more enhanced vocabulary and a better catalog of sound effects than the previous two films) afterwards it is decided that the empire has to go . Which is advantageous as the millennium falcon and a zillion other rebel ships have just shown up and determined that they were expected all along. Our hero in the meantime is engaged is a rather unhealthy encounter session with his abusive father figure. All the time refereed by an aging prune that bears a striking resemblance to grand neagus zek. The empire responds to the show of force in kind.Han and the teddy bear clan continue their plan to sabotage the shield generator. As usual and right on que Han is again captured by the empire. The space fighting continues above as the rebel fighters attempt to shoe a massive amount of tie fighters away from their fleet by bringing the fight to the fleet itself.After successfully stonewalling it opposition on the FOREST moon of endor , the shield falls. In side our hero has unhanded his mechanical father. He rejects the prunes offer of Rotting in evil solidarity whilst ruling the galaxy. The response is well shocking. Outside wedge and lando enter the death star interior in a sort frogger style light cycle race to the stations power core.Yes finally at last the emperor falls from his throne ( still waiting for that thud). Vader faces his son. All is forgiven. The death star explodes. The teddy bears break out the beer. Darth Vader is slow roasted to a fine finish. Everyone lives happily ever after. Except the imperial cleaning crews that are still out there reclaiming use able metals today.On a side note I found the extra behind the scene featurette of Hayden Christensen and Sebastian Shaw throwing it down WWE hardcore style for the little noticed or little cared about non speaking role of the ghost of anakin skywalker enjoyable. Really impressive given Christensen pulled off the upset at all of age 3.Long drawn out and wholly predictable. I thought the droids were the worst. I was soooo wrong. Admiral Akbar. Really?!? OK calamari do not look like that. The garbage eating pacmara from Babylon 5 were much better looking in that sense ( kudos art department). At least the movies are over. Unless the first three films are made. Wiat...NOOOOOOO...."
"Some people have disliked this film, and I truly don't see why. ""Return of the Jedi,"" does not, contrary to popular opinion, ruin the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy but rather ties it up in a perfectly satisfying way. The opening scenes at Jabba the Hutt's palace are well done. Jabba is a much meaner and scarier villain here than the short clip in the 1997 re-release of ""A New Hope"" showed him to be. Luke Skywalker is forced to make his most difficult choices in this film, and the intensity of the film's last half-hour is some of the most compelling film-making I've ever seen. The themes and messages of redemption and good vs. evil are superbly done here. ""Return of the Jedi"" is a very exciting and engaging film, memorable and worth watching many times, especially now that Episode III has been made. It's not as perfect as the previous two Star Wars films were, but it is a very pleasing and happy conclusion to an amazing story. The fourth best in the saga, behind the two originals and Episode III. Nearly perfect.***1/2 out of ****"
"Okay, I give up.  Apparently George Lucas thought that Star Wars did so well because of the merchandising.  Thus, from his head did burst forth the Ewok. (Ewoks seem to be based on Australian tribes people, which is actually a lot better than the crazy Jar-Jar primitive race alien in Ep. 1.)  The story for this movie is excellent, the movie itself is just so half-assed.  I think the entire movie can be judged on the scene in which Luke is fighting off the giant monster creature in Jabba's lair.  The blue screen my weatherman uses looks better than that.  There was really no point in adding new scenes to this film, if not to clean up at least that one shot.  And although Lucas never expected to shoot Empire or Jedi, I'm sure that somewhere in the back of his head he must have been thinking that Mark Hammil would mature into an actor with a more Jedi-like screen personality. Please vote for this movie, I gave it a 5 out of 10, help get it out of the top 50 at least."
"Like most kids from my generation, I grew up on Star Wars.  But if there is such a thing as guilt by association, then there also has to be undue credit by association, and I think Jedi has plenty of that.  As part of the original trilogy, it will always be a hallmark film, and it has plenty of good elements.  But its main contribution, aside from a happy ending, was cramming a record number of elements in the special effects shots.Let's face it:  a new, improved Death Star and a race of teddy bears? How creatively bankrupt can you get?"
