"If I have to say in one word then it'd be MASTERPIECE. It can very well be a classic...a cult classic like Border. This movie doesn't portray blatant Jingoism but strikes the right chords of patriotism with maintaining the right balance. It is so well done that you'd crave for more even if it ends. Everyone performed very well and Vicky Kaushal was stunning. The movie is very inspiring and everyone especially the young generation should watch it to know what the army men do for them. The movie is not political at all but yellow media will try to demean it for 'certain' reasons.
I still can't get over the top notch screenplay, direction, background scores, visuals and performances. A straight 9.5/10 (or may be 10/10 if I don't be skeptical) from me."
"This movie is so real.
Direction is superb.
Vicky kausal is brilliant in his performance.
Script is tightly bound.
Music just complements the action, makes it even better.Must watch !!"
"Watched a wartime movie after long time but I must say this one was the best I saw till date. This movie has a no nonsense plot which is entirely focused on the operation that was conducted for URI. The best part of this movie was there was no unnecessary romantic scene. Another best part of this movie was there was no unnecessary talks, cuss words to show the army's behavior, unlike other movies in past where half of the time is use to convince the audience why the operations are necessary. This is a must watch movie for everyone."
Excellent movie loved it this is the first Indian movie that represents modern Indian Army Aditya dhar done a great job by showing our modern army and special forces and their tactics and operations to civilians my rating is 10/10üáÆüá≥
The movie was very gripping from the very start. Excellent all round acting especially by Vicky Kaushal. The VFX effects were better then most that we have seen recently.Good watch
Awesome movie üëçüëçüëç fill real. Execution of story is great. After Sunny Deoval Border movie. This one is came even better. Background music is just amazing. Everyone should watch this movie.
"Don't get me wrong, movie is good but i feel it is overrated. I know indians are too nationalist but if u look at movie perspective, movie is just average. Lots of thing shown in are wrong."
Huge respect for our soldiers who put their life at risk and neutralized the terrorists. The movie does justice to their heroics.
No doubt this is the best war/ military movie made in india.
"URI:THE SURGICAL STRIKE is not only one of the best indian war films but one of the best international war films ever made. Debutante Aditya Dhar has done an amazing job with his direction. Mitish Mirchandanis amazing cinematography, stellar vfx (the vfx is mind blowing) and an absolute intergalactic background score and music. All the actors in the film have potrayed and amazing job. A great start to 2019 with URI. DEFINITELY A MUST WATCH."
"Hats off to cinematographer , director, script writer for their individual performance rather than only hailing about actors and actresses.This types of movies make india proud, a movie that was waiting to be applauded from us üôè"
"All the characters has done a fantastic job. Well written and directed, awesome music tracks, pounding dialogues. Just go and watch it PERIOD."
It is awesome movie to watch in theater and acting is super awesome by Vick Kausal and song gave me goosebumps.
Perfect. PAISA WASOOL. Vicky Kaushal Brilliant. Nailed It.
"Stop fooling Indian public, put some sense in to movies! This is the first fictional true story."
Its better to watch the documentary available of uri surgical strike available in youtube. That will give a better knowledge of the surgical strike.
I should reccomend everyone to watch this movie.....
"Well it showed many flaws only the emotional drama was bang on targetParesh Rawal is generally a very good actor but in this film..neither his way of speaking nor his attitude convinced me of his high rank portrayed in this movieA high ranking official of the Army (the lady officer) who is an active member of surgical strike plan...would never be sent to someone home as a nurse.. do you think that is believable?The Garood ..that flying surveillance bird which ..could see everything..but it missed the Pakistani boy approaching the window....If i keep on going i can name another 100 flaws...some tactical terms will like ""handler"" and a few others will not really play the trick to convince the viewer of such a skillful operation...Poor execution and flaws pulled it down"
"As the movie is typically bollywood directed movie with the same dialogues filled with hatred, I was expecting the action to be much better.
The shots were either copied or cliched."
I would really like to appreciate Aditya Dharma for his direction and Vicky Kaushal has truly given a lively performance. This is a beautiful movie which tells the surgical strike incident in a precise way.
Just a movie with exaggorated theme.Oroginality and seriousness of the story is lost somewhere.Sucha wasted potential but they are lucky to get a hit with such bad screenplay and direction.Should have been better
This movie was such a masterpiece in bollywood... Great story... Great acting.. Great performance of ever character in this movie.. So good...
"Movies is amazing, good casting, great acting by underrated actors.songs always gave me goosebumps."
"Few movies that get your patriotism to the peak and then leave you speechless at the end of it with sheer brilliance of direction, action direction, writing, acting, and attention to details.Hence proven, superstars don't make films- films make superstars.- Vicky brilliant as usual (Kudos to the leads and the supports)
Eagerly waiting for this winning team to craft many more such high quality cinematic experiences.Go watch the film, now!"
The movie has many such moments which get you to the edge of the seat. A true entertainer with great direction and superb acting.
Go and watch it guysss... Omg!!!!!!!!!!!!................
"------Uri: The Surgical Strike Movie Review: Vicky Kaushals Sterling Performance Adds To The High Josh!Debutant director Aditya Dhar needs to be patted on his back for his well-researched work before transferring his vision on the big screen. In reality, while India and Pakistan's version of this 'surgical strike' have always differed, the film-maker mixes fiction with the facts available in public domain to present a gripping narrative about this covert operation. Without resorting to forced patriotism, the emotions flow naturally in the film.On the flip-side, the film-maker spends a little too much time in building up the drama to establish a personal connect with the characters in the first half of the film. This tends to slow down the pace of the narrative leaving you a bit dry as you eagerly wait for the action to begin.Vicky Kaushal is in a terrific form as the man in uniform and proves yet again why he is one of the best from the current crop of Gen-X actors.Mohit Raina (Mahadev-shiv) makes an impressive transition to the big screen and has a commendable screen presence.Yami Gautam's character begins on an interesting note. However, Aditya Dhar fails to explore more sides to it....yami's role is dull..!!Cinematography is neat and leaves you at the edge of your seats especially in the last 20 minutes of the film.Stefan Richter's action sequences are top-notch and well-choreographed.Every time, Vicky Kaushal's Vihaan screams, 'How's the Josh?' to his battalion of soldiers, you feel the adrenaline rush as you hear, 'Very high, Sir.'Uri manages to make your heart swell with pride for the armed forces who are always ready to sacrifice their lives for the nation."
"This movie, without a doubt, is the best movie I have ever seen. URI THE SURGICAL STRIKE is a very accurate presentation of Surgical strike. In a lot of the parts, I felt like I was actually there. It was all thanks to Aditya Dhar's camera-work.
URI is a remarkable and engaging piece of film making considering the outcome of the story is already well known. We know how it all turns out and You've probably heard about the amount of violence, blood, and gore and that's all true- yet remain mesmerized by familiar details, filmed with a harrowing sense of urgency. That shows debutante Aditya Dhar's skill as a director.
The incredible visuals throughout the movie are captivating from start to finish showing the horrors that befall soldiers at war.
Coming to performances Vicky Kaushal owns the film once again as Vihan as he laughs, cries and shouts in anger, making you root for him all the way. Paresh Rawal deserves a round of applause for his nuanced performance as the NSA. Mohit Raina gets an interesting character to portray and he justifies it completely. Yami Gautam does a fine job as another Intelligence officer but gets a limited scope.MUST WATCH"

Bollywood should release more than 10 movies like this. Its a new level movie. And no songs is the best.
"I saw this movie today, first day first show, I must say what a mature acting by all of them (cast). This movie describe Indian army so beautifully, that how powerful and strong our Army is. Jai Hind, Jai Bharat* Must watch Guyss"
Joke of a movie. How convenient was it to go inside the enemy territory and kill hundreds of them by guns and combats and not even a single casualty? Even the shooting from the chopper was not able to kill one!! Only in Indian movies this can happen !! Disappointed.
This movie is osm thnx for making this great movie
"Movies is amazing, good casting, great acting by underrated actors.songs always gave me goosebumps."
"I cannot believe this is sitting at 9.1 in the ratings, it cannot be????? Not a great film at all, rather boring."
"I was waiting for this movie since I saw its teaser.. and I would say its was worth the wait. I live in Canada and I was feeling so proud by how everyone was screaming Bharat mata ki jai at the end of the movie (even foreigners).
One of the best war movie ever made in Bollywood. Great direction, Top notch cinematography, world class acting and above all best screen portray of a one of the significant event of an Indian history.
Vickey Kaushal yet again proved that he is the next big thing in Bollywood.Every Indian should definitely watch this movie.

"Cinematically flawed yet a praiseworthy attempt to depict an event previously unheard in India's military history. Vicky Kaushal portrays the lead perfectly. Our films do project over emotional or chest thumping Army Officers but Vicky's character is a perfect blend of suppressed emotion coated with a sense of duty. His performance undoubtedly is the greatest asset of the film. Paresh Rawal's character which is based on the lines of NIA chief Ajit Doval keeps the story moving forward. Although I feel certain dialogues like ""Surgical Strike karte hain"" in a closed door meeting with the PM and other top notches or ""Halke halke badhate rahiyega"" could have been better conceived. The Drone selection scene where an intern makes the DRDO chief look like a fool and earn Paresh's compliment ""Son you may have just won us the War"" seemed to be an attempt of comic relief. But only an actor of the calibre of Paresh Rawal could have pulled it off and he did it with a natural candour.There were other plot loopholes. The main mission was made too easy. The strikes were picturesque but the climax lacked nail biting sequences. You are in the enemy's territory furtively and wiping out a selected bunch of dreaded terrorists!!! This is where a Black Hawk Down or a Hurt Locker scores. In the end the resolute of one who decided to overstay to kill the last man standing proved that after all it's Bollywood.Apart from Vicky and Rawal's performance, casting and cinematography deserves a thundering applause. Army thrillers tend to be multistarrers and hence there's always a pressure on the script to accommodate everyone's heroics. Uri is free from this defect and therefore the actors successfully become characters in the plot. Coming to the photogenic part, Uri is visually brilliant. The long range shots of valley, the stretches of Baramulla, the night scenes were wonderfully shot.Overall, definitely a one time watch."
First half is too slow but the second half is full of action. A much hyped ordinary film.
"Go.. Watch it with your family, friends.. Shout out loud ""jai hind"" ""bharat mata ki jai""
If u love your country, your motherland then you r for sure a hypernationalist.
Be proud and get your chest pump 56inch watching the bravery and valour of your soldiers.."
"Vicky Kaushal was exceptional as an Army Major, even though I was well versed with the plot of the film due to the various documentaries I had seen, the movie still kept me on the edge of the seat. The background score was commendable, the action sequences are so well choreographed. Not a foot wrong by a debutant director."
It's by far the best War Movie of Bollywood...The Direction is Picture Perfect...This movie is all about Patriotism Pride and lots off Adrenaline Pumping Moment.. MindBlowing Cinematography...I can gurentee you Your blood will be pumping high also feel very proud of Indian Army after watching this...A Masterpiece..
"Do watch it..The best movie to be watched...
Excellent acting, story, screenplay"
"Yeh naya India Hai !!! The film is cinematically classy, script wise Rock solid and can give tough competition to most of the war genre film's of the world. Real events interpreted bravely and the revenge of the martyrs in NDA's quick decision making governance is showcased thouroughly. For all the martyrsA must watch war film !"
"From start till end, i was not bored for a single moment!. I dont care about who is the hero, but his work was really fantastic, he looks like an army men, strong, hard, brave and action. Please do not expect movie to display whole story in just 2.15hrs. But they have done their best to put down the complete summary.This film force me to that how might a solider would feel when he is on mission, what is the level of planning goes on in our nation to keep indians safe, they put thier life at risk just to make us feel pride of them. I would say, hats off to indian para commandos for their bravery. I am really proud to be an Indian. Thanks for this great master piece given by bollywood which would inspire youngsters to join para commandos and indian army. We expect such great quality movies from bollywood. Must watch for sure."
"Even though I am still wondering the point of Uri, a self-boasting, anti-cantankerous film based on actual events, it did not cross my mind till before the second half when I was honestly enjoying Aditya Dhar's superior craft of war and its storytelling as he gives into the dreamy requirements of every patriotic cinema enthusiast in an action film where Pakistan again plays the bad element for the nth time and Vicky Kaushal moves to the next level of stardom. TN."
"Awesome performance by Vicky.
Aditya dhar has done a great job.
10/10"
One of the great movies based on real events with breathtaking direction and action.
Most useless movie and a waste of time. Nothing but jingoism and utopian ideas
