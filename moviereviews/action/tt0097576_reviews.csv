Reviews
"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) is an Action Classic adventure better film than Temple of Doom , is still the best follow up in the trilogy and clever. It is also the greatest sequel of all time. It is one of my personal favorite adventure movies of all time. I love this movie to death. I loved it as a child and I still love it. After the dark middle chapter it was time for Indy to return to form and more lighthearted fair. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was the answer. Not to mention that bringing in Bond aka Sean Connery as Indy's dad was perfect casting. Connery adds his own whit & charm along with Indy's usual counterparts who where missed in The Temple of Doom. Last Crusade also bookends the trilogy well since the artifact he is after is related to God. While ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" isn't by any means what I would consider a stellar film, it was still an enjoyable and memorable theatrical experience, and in my opinion, easily ranks as the best sequel in the series. For all its faults and shortcomings (perhaps most of all, River Phoenix' laughably terrible haircut as the young Indy), the film succeeds in hitting the key notes at the proper moments, thus drumming up enough of the right combination of story and thematic elements, action and humor to make it worthwhile. Nevertheless, the bottom line is that it still pales in comparison to the level of across-the-board excellence that was achieved in the original 1981 movie. Still though, fans of this one will definitely want to pick up this excellent release, of which, throughout the entire presentation, I only came across a handful of things I thought could possibly be improved upon technically.This is probably the best installment of the Indiana Jones series. Raiders is a spectacular introduction to Dr. Jones and his style, Temple of Doom is an awesome Action, Adventure flick! Last Crusade rights the ship again with a go-for-broke production. Everything about it is huge- Jones is saving the planet from the Nazis for the second time. The budget was in place and off went Spielberg to make an epic, successfully. The film is bookended by two of the best things to appear in any of Spielberg's output: A young Indiana ""beginning"" his archaeological career, losing his treasure- just like the opening of Raiders- and being told by the man in his trademark hat ""You lost today kid, but that doesn't mean you have to like it."" and at the end, riding off into the sunset, literally. Such a conclusion could be seen as contrived but it works so well here. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade has lots of hand-to-hand combat, action-filled chases, and gun fights. Main characters are in near-constant peril, and one is shot point blank and almost bleeds to death. Minor characters are killed in somewhat gruesome ways, including beheading; a bad guy meets his end in a fairly disturbing scene. There's a bit of kissing/banter, and it's implied that two men have slept with the same woman. Language is mild, and there's ultimately a strong message about the importance of the father-son relationship.Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is a 1989 American adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg, from a story co-written by executive producer George Lucas. It is the third installment in the Indiana Jones franchise. A cult film, still one of my favorite films in the series and the last good Indiana Jones movie we didn't need another sequel after third release. There's nothing more exciting than trying to keep up with the Joneses in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Indy's Nazi enemies are back and have kidnapped his father, Professor Henry Jones Sr. (Sean Connery), in their effort to locate the sacred Holy Grail. Following a trail from America to Venice to the deserts of the Middle East, it's up to Indy (Harrison Ford) to save his father, save the Grail and save the day in this non-stop, action-packed adventure the whole family will treasure.The chemistry between Sean Connery and Harrison Ford makes this movie a stand out from the rest of the series. The story of their father and son relationship wrapped in the search for the holy grail is what makes this spectacular Indy movie, a more meaningful adventure. 10/10 Bad Ass Seal Of Approval"
"It's a perfect action-adventure, with elements of fantasy. The best part is the coming together of Sean Connery and Harrison Ford. One is a field agent and the other is strictly an academician.Some films are timeless. This is one of them. No modern adventure film comes close to this."
"Rating: **** out of ****My opinion of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade could be deemed slightly biased. It is the first film I ever saw in theaters and it's also the first movie I purchased on video. I even own the same, worn-down, beat-up copy (and look upon it even more fondly than the widescreen edition, for sentimental reasons, of course) (but nothing beats the pristine quality DVD). I think it's fair to say it's this movie that cemented my love of cinema, the high regard I hold for great escapism, which is sorely lacking from today's cinema; movies that should be fun now drag or bludgeon themselves with relentlessly awful scripts or MTV-style direction that turns relatively simple scenes into chaotic blurs. The Last Crusade may only be thirteen years old, but I think I can safely say they don't make them like they used to.The film stars, of course, Harrison Ford as Indy Jones, the archaeologist/adventurer who's on yet another quest, this time to find his father, who'd been searching for the Holy Grail. Said Dad is played by none other than Sean Connery, whose highly charismatic performance is quick to place this film, acting-wise, above the others in the trilogy by giving Ford a genuine acting equal (let me put it this way, he's only half a notch below Harrison Ford/Indy in charisma and appeal if that tells you anything). The rest of the film focuses on this ongoing journey between father and son (eventually joined along by Sallah and Marcus Brody), complete with amazing action and stunt sequences, clever humor, and nasty (but fun) surprises.The script, by Jeffrey Boam, takes a few cues from Raiders of the Lost Ark, but actually improves upon that story by paying more attention to characterization. The delightful opening scene (all three movies really open with a bang, don't they?); which details how young Indy got his scar, whip, hat, and fear of snakes; makes for a better prequel than Temple of Doom (and any of The Adventure of Young Indiana Jones, for that matter).The story is engrossing because there's a lot of fun clues offered towards the location of the Grail and, thus, there's a lot of engaging little discoveries (love the ""X marks the spot"" scene). I'm quite certain, like with Raiders of the Lost Ark, the plot has a few holes, but they're fairly hard to notice, and I've seen this movie quite a few times, but maybe it's just my enjoyment of the film clouding that up. Either way, it speaks volumes in favor of Spielberg's direction and the performances.Given that action and adventure is the series' selling point, you can expect the thrills and wondrous delight of discovery delivered in spades. The action scenes are terrific (and matched well with John Williams' rousing, memorable score, also the best of the trilogy), the best being a fantastic ten-minute chase sequence on board (and in) a tank, possibly the best action sequence of Spielberg's career. I also loved the motorcycle chase and the Zeppelin setpiece, where the heroes go about dispatching of two enemy fighters in unexpected, but quite hilarious, fashion. The climax, complete with frightening booby traps, is a suspenseful venture into the unknown.The Last Crusade is far more humor-oriented than its predecessors, but part of the movie's effectiveness is that it's able to deliver belly laughs without defusing the tension during the action sequences. Some of the jokes are just brilliant, including one with Indy armed with a Luger in confrontation with a trio of Nazis on board a tank that's even funnier than the swordsman scene in Raiders (well, to me, at least).The supporting cast is all-around superb; John Rhys-Davies is back as Sallah, wonderful as ever and displaying a bit more enthusiasm searching for the Grail than he did digging up the Ark of the Covenant. The late Denholm Elliot also returns as Marcus Brody, the most lovable goof of a museum curator. Alison Doody is interesting as Elsa, the blonde historian whom Indy falls for; a twist involving her character and her actions towards the climax make her not as one-dimensional as she may initially appear. Julian Glover is the best of the main Indy villains, he's far more menacing than Paul Freeman's Belloq and less over-the-top but equally enjoyable as Amrish Pruri's Mola Ram. I also enjoyed Michael Byrne's performance as the Jones hating Colonel Vogel, who relishes in torturing Indy and his father. When it comes to pure delightfully nasty villainy, Byrne is even more fun to watch than Glover.Harrison Ford delivers his best Indy performance (maybe even his best performance, period) in this particular adventure. With the addition of Connery as his father, it reveals a personal side to Indy we haven't seen before. It's his rapport with Connery that separates this film from the rest of the genre. They craft an uncannily touching, funny, and genuine bond. That, coupled with the superb action and thrills, solidifies The Last Crusade as the pinnacle of high adventure summer entertainment."
"Everything clicks in this action-packed cliffhanger. In his third (and what for years what thought to be his last) adventure, Indy is on the hunt for that ultimate treasure, the Holy Grail. Along the way he must contend with Nazis, a secret brotherhood and, of course, snakes. Sean Connery is a wonderful addition as Indy's father, and the chemistry between he and star Harrison Ford may just be one of the best in film history. The movie is a true rarity in that its attempts to outdo each preceding chase sequence succeed. Though children might have trouble interpreting the plot, this crusade is one people of all ages will enjoy."
"One thing you gotta say for this series: it isn't boring.And ""Last Crusade"" has enough thrills, chills and spills to fill up a few dozen old Saturday afternoon serials.  Right down the line, everything about this film is superb.  Ford and Connery do the father and son routine superbly.  Rhys-Davies returns as Sallah, as does Elliott who plays Brody with as much befuddlement as Connery does his role.  And who can blame him? And the FX: there's so many you lose count.  But don't bother, just sit back, relax and get swept up in the moment.  You can't help yourself but to get into this ""Crusade"".Ten stars.  A classic Ford with a bright Sean."
"""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" was supposed to be the final movie in the ""Indiana Jones"" series. At least that's what director Steven Spielberg and producer George Lucas said at the time this film hit theaters. But now they've said there will be a fourth ""Indiana Jones"" film. I really don't know if that's a good idea, because the ""Last Crusade"" was a fitting end to a great movie series. Harrison Ford returns for his third go around as swashbuckling hero Indiana Jones, this time accompanied by Sean Connery as Indy's father, Dr. Henry Jones. These two actors work beautifully together as they fight off the Nazis in search for the Holy Grail. Two actors from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" reprise their roles to great effect in ""Last Crusade"": Denholm Elliott as Marcus Brody and John Rhys-Davies as Sallah. Alison Doody is the heroine (good or bad?); Julian Glover is the villain; River Phoenix portrays a young Indy at the beginning to see how this character really got his start. ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" not only has great characters, it also has a decent story (taking place in 1938), plus exciting action scenes and special effects. It's better than the second film ""Temple of Doom"" and comes very close to topping the first film ""Raiders"". The ""Indiana Jones"" series should stay right where it is with the ""Last Crusade"" as the finale. Unless Spielberg, Lucas, and Ford can prove us wrong and make a really good fourth film in the series, we shall see. I loved all three movies in the ""Indiana Jones"" series. If the fourth film does gets made, I hope it'll be equally as good as the first three.**** (out of four)"
"Indiana Jones, the man, the legend, the whip. Everyone I know has seen at least one of the Indiana Jones movies and usually Raiders of the Lost Ark is their favorite. Now I loved Raiders of the Lost Ark, I also really loved Temple of Doom even though it gets a lot of hate for it's darkness. But The Last Crusade is my favorite of the trilogy and the strongest in my opinion. For goodness's sake we have Sean Connery as Indiana's father, how could we get any better than that? I love his way of saying ""Junior!"", always gets me in a good chuckle. Harrison Ford still has that same Indy charm that swoons the ladies, the adventure that captivates the guys and takes us on an incredible journey that we'll never forget.In 1938, Indiana finally recovers the Cross and donates it to his friend Marcus Brody's museum. Indiana is later taken to the residence of wealthy businessman Walter Donovan, who informs him that his father has vanished while searching for the Holy Grail, leaving behind partial directions from an incomplete stone tablet along with his diary containing his life's work on the Grail. Indiana and Marcus travel to Venice to investigate Henry's disappearance, meeting up with his colleague Elsa Schneider. Discovering catacombs beneath the library where Henry was last seen, Indiana and Elsa find the tomb of Sir Richard, a knight of the First Crusade who is buried with a complete version of the tablet. Indiana finds his father, only to be betrayed by Elsa, who reveals that she and Donovan are working with the Nazis to find the Grail. The Nazis steal the Grail diary and capture Marcus in Iskenderun, where he was sent with pages from the diary to seek the protection of Sallah. The Joneses manage to escape the castle and follow the Nazis to Berlin, where they recover the diary from Elsa. The Joneses, Marcus and Sallah arrive to find that the Nazis are unable to pass through three ""trials"" of God. After Indy's father gets shot, he doesn't have much of a choice as to pass the trials and choose the correct cup to save his father's life.Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is one of my favorite movies of all time, it's just a flawless movie that will always be timeless. My future kids will watch these movies, they're just a lot of fun. Who said archeology can't be fun? This also has one of the most exciting chase scenes of all time, Indiana is trying to rescue his father and a friend from a Nazi tank and he is on a horse, a brutal fight ensues and was just so exciting to watch. I've watched this movie since I was a little girl and I still watch it with pleasure today, even with my friends we love watching Indiana and his adventures. They're an absolute blast and if you haven't seen Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, please take the first opportunity you have to watch it, it's a great movie.10/10"
"Indiana Jones teams up with his father to try and locate the Holy Grail. Something that the Nazis are again particularly interested in themselves.We didn't know it at the time, but every Indiana Jones fan on the planet presumed that The Last Crusade was to be the final film to feature the intrepid archaeologist. As it turned out, another film would surface in 2008, but casting that aside (as many would like to do), Last Crusade should, and is, judged as the trilogy closer it was meant to be.In 1988 Steven Spielberg was deep into bringing Rain Man to fruition, all thoughts of Indiana Jones had gone by the wayside with the harshly judged part two, Temple Of Doom. In stepped George Lucas to politely remind Spielberg that they had an agreement to make another Indiana Jones picture, Spielberg no doubt obliged and humble, passed on his Rain Man work to Barry Levinson who promptly bagged himself an Oscar for the film. It can be guessed that Spielberg was probably grouchy around this period, but he needn't have worried, because The Last Crusade provided a much needed hit for not only himself (post Empire Of The Sun), but also Lucas (Willow) and Harrison Ford (Frantic).I mention the run up to this picture because it explains a lot on why the film is pretty much a retread of Raiders Of The Lost Ark, something that some detractors find unforgivable. Yet Last Crusade is still an immensely enjoyable adventure picture, with Spielberg proving that he was still capable of a popcorn bonanza. Using the Raiders formula and moving away from the dark flourishes of Temple Of Doom, Last Crusade is actually the simplest film of the three, but still it manages, courtesy of a sparkling casting decision, to become the most entertaining of the original trilogy. Is it better than Raiders? Of course not, but it positively rips along with sparky dialogue and an agenda of cliffhanging suspense like the adventure films of yore.In comes Sean Connery as Dr Jones Senior, and its the picture's trump card, because the magnificent interplay and obvious rapport with Ford (cool as a cucumber) is there for all to see. It's this what drives the film on through the more mundane and picture filler sequences, showcasing two top wily professionals with care and consideration to their craft. The casting of Alison Doody as the main female is a poor one, and one only has to look at her subsequent career post Crusade to see she wasn't up to the task here. Bonus comes in the form of the River Phoenix prologue, Phoenix as the young Indiana paves the way for the jaunty path that Crusade takes, whilst simultaneously giving us a nice little back story from which to launch the adventure.Made for $48 million, the film went on to gross $474,171,806 Worldwide, now that's a lot of people who evidently were happy with Raiders Of The Lost Ark 2! And I gleefully count myself amongst that number. 9/10"
"This was an amazing movie, my personal favorite in the Indy series. Has good plot, a lot of humor, and some emotion too. not to mention plot twists"
"When the two greatest filmmakers in the world teamed up to create the best action movie of all time - Raiders of the Lost Ark, it seemed unlikely that they could duplicate their divinely-inspired work. After a miss with the entertaining yet forgettable Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade comes pretty close to doing just that.Film history's most profitable star Harrison Ford returns to his signature role in a performance that speaks for itself, and benefits greatly from a gallery of memorable supporting characters. That includes Sean Connery, the grandest of all modern action day movie heroes (and appropriately cast, as the spiritual father of the character is James Bond). Connery plays against that, in a performance that is different than anything he has ever done, and it works. Even so, Denholm Elliott can't seem to help stealing every scene he's in as Marcus Brody, a lifelong friend of the Jones family.This movie stands by itself in the way it deals with spirituality, and is thick with religious themes throughout, without preaching to you. This is a very difficult balance to achieve in any film, and that alone makes the film stand out as brilliant. It is more abundant with humor than the previous two films, without the characters falling into irritating self-parody. Being a sequel, this is a difficult balance to achieve as well. (Look at action sequels such as Lethal Weapon 4).This film stands among the greatest action adventures of all time. I don't know anyone who hasn't seen it, but if you haven't, don't walk to see it. Run."
"Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade was, in my opinion, the best movie of the Indiana Jones trilogy. This movie featured the same type of humor we have become accustomed to from Jones, as well as another beautiful woman (also probably the best Indy girl) and lots of great action scenes! This movie starts off with a teenage Indy (River Phoenix) which gives us a look at an event that molds his life and character as well as his relationship with his father, Henry (Sean Connery). We also learn he is a ""Junior"" and that he hates to be called that.Back as an adult, Indy's father is kidnapped and he must set out to find him. His only clues are his father's diary notes, which were mysteriously sent to him earlier that day. They lead him to Italy, where he meets the gorgeous blonde, Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody), who becomes an integral part of this story.Once again, the grown up Indy (Harrison Ford) does battle with the Nazis. Apparently, Adolf Hitler is after the Holy Grail, which contains the blood of Christ. So Indiana and his father team up to get there first. Along the way, there is a great action scene where Jones fights a few Nazis on board a moving tank.Overall, as I mentioned earlier, I believe this to be the best Indiana Jones movie of the three. This action movie was good long before movie studios learned to make the great CGI and special effects. It's effects were pretty good anyways but back in 1989, things just did not look as good as they can make them today. Still, highly recommended and worth your time. 9.5/10"
"""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" was the third and final instalment in the original Indiana Jones trilogy. Whereas ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" was a prequel to ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", ""Last Crusade"" is a true sequel. Apart from an opening scene relating an adventure of the teenage Indy as a Boy Scout in 1912, the action takes place in 1938, two years after ""Raiders"". (In this opening scene we learn how the hero got his nickname; Indiana is not, as I had always assumed, his home state, but a name borrowed from his pet dog).Whereas ""Raiders"" was a great commercial and critical success, ""Temple of Doom"" received considerable criticism, both on account of its dark, gloomy atmosphere and its racist treatment of Indian characters. Steven Spielberg, therefore, was determined to make the third film lighter in tone, closer in spirit to ""Raiders"". Once again the villains are the Nazis, once again the plot involves the search for a legendary relic with mystical powers (in this case the Holy Grail which caused such excitement among King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table) and once again much of the action takes place in the Middle East. (This must be the only Hollywood film ever to be set- ostensibly- in the short-lived Republic of Hatay, formerly part of French Syria and today part of southern Turkey, which enjoyed a brief independence for several months in 1938/9. Most of the ""Hatay"" scenes, however, were shot in Spain, with the ruins of Petra, actually in Jordan, standing in for the temple in which the Grail is housed).The film also introduces us to Indy's father, Henry Jones, Sr. The James Bond films were undoubtedly one of the inspirations for this franchise, and it was possibly in their homage that Sean Connery was cast as the elder Jones, even though he is only twelve years older than Harrison Ford. (That speedboat chase along the Venetian canals also seems to be homage to Bond). Like his son, Henry senior is an academic archaeologist and has gone missing while seeking the Holy Grail. Indy believes that his father is in danger and sets out to find him, a quest that will take him to Venice, Germany and ultimately Hatay. The main female character is Henry's colleague, Dr. Elsa Schneider, a glamorous Austrian blonde whose loyalties are ambiguous.There is more stress on character development here than in other episodes of the franchise, with emphasis being placed on the father-son relationship. The film is not just about the search for the physical Holy Grail. Even in the Arthurian legend the Grail was as much a symbol as a physical object, and today the phrase ""holy grail"" is used metaphorically for anything which is desirable and much sought-after. The film is also about Indiana's search for his lost father and their efforts to re-establish a relationship which in the past has often been strained- the story's metaphorical Holy Grail. Ford and Connery are both good at bringing out this aspect of the story. There are also good contributions from Denholm Elliott as Indiana's bumbling colleague Marcus Brody and Alison Doody as the treacherous, seductively sinister Elsa.After the awful ""Temple of Doom"", ""Last Crusade"" represents a welcome return to form, both for Spielberg and for Ford, who seemed ill at ease in the earlier film but here is back to his old ebullient self. The film contains a better balance of suspense and humour than did its predecessor, much of the humour being at the expense of the hapless Marcus. There are some excellent action scenes, such as the train sequence in the opening scene, the escape from the Zeppelin and the tank chase though the desert. ""Last Crusade"" is a very enjoyable adventure film in the same tradition as ""Raiders"". 7/10"
"The second sequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark is an awesome, beautifully crafted film, and arguably the best of the Indiana Jones trilogy. The film is funnier, classier and far more laid back than the other two woody story lines, mostly because of the introduction of the excellent Sean Connery as Indy's eccentric father. Spielberg and Lucas get back on track after their off the rails first sequel in which to many peoples' horror had none of the Nazis or characters that made Raiders so unique, however, what Spielberg does to make this film a classic is the use of historical data with the swashbuckling storyline of adventure and action. Not to mention that this may well be the greatest feel good film ever made..."
This movie had meant more to me than just about any other. Enjoy.
"The Last Crusade is as fine as a finale as you'll ever have. The inclusion of Sean Connery as Indy's stern father makes the chemistry and quips perfect, with another Nazi bound adventure, this time for the Holy Grail. Yes, it may seem like a re-tread or re-hash of the first movie, but its keep the entertainment factor to the maximum, and the film's real star is the relationship between father and son. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is easily one of the best films of all time."
"Even if raiders of the lost ark is the most iconic and the most famous movie of the Indiana Jones saga, the last crusade is far away beyond the other three movies. The plot, combining the goodness of God with Nazis, the actors and their work,(for me professor Henry jones is the best portrayal of Sean Connery after the untouchables) and the music from John Williams that makes this movie a classic that never gets old and that you can watch it over and over again!"
"After two successful big-budget starring vehicles, we finally get an origin story for Indiana Jones. Of course, that's largely to facilitate the addition of a new supporting character (Sean Connery in a wonderful casting as Indy's long lost father, who we'll get to in just a moment) but that extra layer of nostalgia, wrapped around a property that's deeply nostalgic in the first place, manages to avoid numerous pitfalls and serve as an effective prologue. River Phoenix performs especially well as the young Jones, expertly wearing Harrison Ford's mannerisms throughout the long callback, and somewhere along the way we get a worthwhile genesis for the grown-up version's affinity for leather jackets and fedoras.Once the story jumps ahead to a more familiar era (if not precisely the present), it's full speed ahead on the hunt for the mythical holy grail, a lifelong obsession for the father and recent fixation of the third reich. Soon reunited, both Jones boys dance through precarious situations and near-misses in the history books, a full battalion of Nazi soldiers nipping at their heels, before drawing close to the prize. Ford and Connery are dynamic together, boiling down a complicated father-son relationship to a series of glares, grins and grunts. They alternate between bickering testily and slapping each other on the back in camaraderie, and I honestly can't say which makes for a more entertaining watch. There's depth, too, a stinging blend of long-simmering resentment and earnest care for one another, which often bubbles up just in time to enhance the plot's heaviest moments.Naturally, it simply wouldn't be an Indiana Jones movie without big action sets (in which the series somehow manages to one-up itself yet again) or boatloads of witty retorts and punchy one-liners, and those two essential elements combine to give the film a loose, fun-loving quality without compromising any of the more serious moments. All this without going too far over the top, as we saw more than once in the mildly underwhelming Temple of Doom and borderline-disastrous Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. It's well-written and purposeful, successfully intense and humorous, an in-the-wheelhouse serial-styled adventure that spans several continents before confronting superstition and cracking several dusty, life-threatening riddles on the path to a biblical treasure. Indy probably should've left well-enough alone, because this chapter is essentially impossible to top."
"Who are the morons that say the first Indiana Jones movie is the best? Have they entirely missed The Last Crusade? Adventurous? Tick. Music Composer? Tick. Funny? Tick. Just about any category you could think of, George Lucas ticked every box. Sean Connery's chemistry with Harrison Ford was hilarious. ""I like the Austrian way better."" ""So did I..."""
"Last Crusade is without a doubt my favorite of the Indiana Jones series, and I think a lot of people would agree. Sure there are some people who prefer Raiders of the Lost Ark, but this film is often regarded as one of the best sequels of all time. As it should be, it fixes most of the problems with it's predecessors, and enhances on the stuff that made that film work.There really isn't that much wrong with the movie, at it's worst moments it can be a little boring. But I also get confused as to what the movie is trying to do with with Dr. Shnieder. Spoiler Alert, but it turns out she's a Nazi, but then she's crying at the book burning, then she's clearly evil again, then she's good, then evil, by the end I wasn't sure if I was supposed to like her or not.The best part about this movie are the scenes between Indy and his dad. Harrison Ford and Sean Connery are downright hilarious at times, and have great chemistry, I actually believed that they were father and son. The action scenes are fantastic, and unlike Raiders the pacing is perfect, a perfect blend of action, comedy, drama, and adventure. Most of the special effects have held up pretty well, sure some stuff is obvious green screen but most of it's not noticeable. The villains are good, not quite as good as the ones from Raiders, but very threatening. The adventure element is great, it's sort of a mystery as well as a treasure hunt. And River Phoenix looks exactly like a young Harrison Ford.Despite not being a hardcore Indiana Jones fan, I say Last Crusade is one of the best adventure movies ever made. It's funny, exiting, has some great characters, and is very well written and directed."
"The 1930s archaeologist and adventurer Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) , a larger that life hero , with its battered hat and whip wielding will confront evil Nazis for the obtaining the Holy Grail . This time he makes couple with his daddy (Sean Connery) along with a beautiful woman (Alison Doody) and friends (Denholm Elliott and John Rhys Davies) . Brave and daredevil Indiana Jones risks his life facing off villains , taking on armoured tanks , warplane , cliffs and several dangers and adventures.Dr.Indiana executes feats of derring-do in various exotic countries . It's the finale part of adventures trilogy (along with : Raiders of the lost ark and Temple of Doom ) going on the way of the 30s classic films and the Comic-books language .The picture blends comedy , adventures , action , rip-roaring , Cliff-hunger , tongue-in-cheek and being extremely entertaining and fun . Harrison Ford plays magnificently as the valiant and impulsive archaeologist turned into an action man .F or comic relief in charge of continued jokes about the relationship between Indy and his dad .The picture has great loads of action , special effects abundant and habitual and impressive John Williams musical score .The movie has a spectacular intervening period when Indiana is fighting against a tank that will have you on the edge of your seat , but the action never lets up. In this flick appears River Phoenix as an adolescent Indiana in a spectacular and frenetic beginning. The film is followed by the TV series ,also produced by George Lucas : ¨The young Indiana Jones¨ with Sean Patrick Flannery. The motion picture was splendidly directed by Steven Spielberg , being his favorite of the ""Indiana Jones"" films , and it is on record as saying he directed the pic for two reasons: To fulfill a three-picture obligation he had made with George Lucas, and, and to atone for the criticism that he received for the previous installment, Indiana Jones and the temple of Doom (1984). It obtained some Academy Awards, secondary Oscars for editing and sound effects, very well deserved although I miss didn't achieve more. The movie will appeal to Indiana saga fans as well as the neophyte who didn't have seen the previous episodes .It's indispensable and essential watching . Rating : excellent , above average and well worth seeing. It's a winner for Harrison Ford fans."
"By the time of this writing, Blockbuster Inc. stores probably have all but vanished. Each with a sign that indicates that it's ""just this store"" that's closing. Sad, but that's how the story goes. Remember the Beta Video stores?When I was a kid, and we got our very first VCR – man, that was like the invention of television for those around my age – and I was able to save up enough money to buy two previously viewed movies. And get this: I had to actually pre-order previously viewed VCR tapes and they were incredibly $19.95 apiece!No matter; I really wanted both Lethal Weapon 2 and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. And bad.They were like gold for me. And they, along with a birthday gift of the original Batman, certainly earned their weight. I must've watched those three – my only movies – fifty times each.So, you can see: I am very familiar with Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Every inch, score number and frame. I love this movie.Later, I would contest and readily agree, Raiders of the Lost Ark is both a masterpiece and better film, but that doesn't deter on howmuchFUN this third installment is. And I'm not even mentioning the dreadful part two: Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. In my mind, there's only Indy 1 and 3. You can even forget the (yawn) Young Indiana Jones (so-called) Adventures.Everything worked in this movie: suburb acting, hilarious and fun dialogue – mostly from the chemistry (or banter) of the two Jones's, extreme adventure, exciting action, fantastic characters, nostalgia – for fans of Raiders and great twists. And one of the best aspects is also a spoiler, – sorry, but if you haven't seen this 22-year-old epic, that's your fault – it has one of the best endings in the history of cinema: they actually ride off into the sunset. Brilliant and beautiful ending to the series!** - that is until they ruined it with the overkill: Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Best advice? Think of this as the actual LAST adventure and forget that wretched sequel.Heck, I can't really pinpoint many, if any, faults or flaws in Last Crusade. Pooossssibly, the over-long opening segment with the original ""Young Indiana"" played by the late and great River Phoenix? Even that was entertaining, fun and had an awesome score track. So, technically, it's not a setback, but perhaps needed a little more editing.Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is overwhelmed at school, but is more so when his father, Henry Jones, Sr. (Sean Connery – in, Literally one of his best on-screen performances) is listed as missing. Indy is tempted with the prospect of finding the mystical Holy Grail, even though he, himself, doesn't believe it. He does set off on a mission to find his father, but we all know, he'd equally like to find this ""Lost Cup of Jesus Christ.""He meets up with (what I grew up referring to as ""the blonde"") the beautiful and seductive dame Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody) and they quest to find daddy Jones and ward off Nazis. Not so much a spoiler, but he does rescue Henry Jones, Sr. and the race for the Grail is on between the Jones's and the Nazis.I left out a lot, but that's the basic, BASIC, premise. Seriously, if you have not seen this, or have even, see it (again, if you have) and learn to enjoy the film that frankly defines adventure. And a movie that captures the heart of the original, the atmosphere of the serials of before most of our times and how movies were really made: pre-CGI.On a related note: while some people are anti-3D, I am boarder-line anti-CGI. Sure it's a cheaper way of filmmaking, but I feel it's just that: cheap. Rarely will it be believable in my sight, for the most part it's all-but a cartoon and extremely laughable. That said, it can worksometimes. The recent 2010 Alice in Wonderland film is a perfect example of how it can really work and impress me. But, 80% of the time, it's just plain corny, distracting and again, CHEAP. My favorite action/adventures films are how they used to be made: with both inventiveness and heart. Like this one. Heck, I'll take a blue/green screen any day over a computer telling me what's ""real"" looking.But, I digress. I hesitate in calling this a masterpiece (in filmmaking, at least) but in my mind it is. And seeing that this is an opinion piece, I will go on record: it doesn't get much better than this.I remember some of the promotional shots on the late night shows from Harrison Ford, et al, that casually admitted Temple of Doom was a disaster – I AGREE – and this was a make-up movie. It sure the heck was! This was thee number one redemption movie of all time.Note to Hollywood: continue the redemption. Make movies like this, verses the CGI-laced, no-script films of the last decade or so. Remember what it's like to have this much fun in the movie going experience. I remember. I recall 1989 when this was released as my all-time favorite year in films released. Too bad, they haven't come close to '89 in 22 years.And Hollywood won't listen. I ask that you do. Support and watch movies like Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Remember what it was like to have fun in the theatre, what it was like when real special-effect crews did real work on the fields and not in the office and remember what it was like to be a kid again. See this movie!"
"An ideal action-comedy/adventure if there ever was one; in this entertaining third installment archaeologist Ford must travel to Italy in 1938 to try and rescue his estranged father. However, the rescue mission soon turns into a historic quest as he seeks out the Holy Grail, once again finds himself battling Hitler's Nazis, and again encounters dangerous perils every step of the way. Follows basically the same formula as Raiders of the Lost Ark, but Connery is an added bonus as Ford's father and the two make a perfect duo. A good blend of elements as the film provides lots of exciting, cliffhanger action scenes/stunts, memorable lines, and genuine humor, but the relationship between the two leads is what really gives it stability. Lots of fun. ***½"
"I have been a fan of the Indiana Jones franchise since a young child, and this is and always has been my favourite film. It has everything in a film you could want or need. Harrison Ford is fantastic as usual and paired up with James Bond (Sean Connery) it's a perfect match. The humour throughout is in perfect amount used at the right time. The action sequences are phenomenal with some of the best stunts I have seen in a film. The story line is fantastic and flows without a dull moment. If only I could travel back in time and watch this film when it first came out in the cinema, seeing it for the first time! 10 out of 10 all the way. This film set the standard for me for films of this genre."
"Adventure action at its best, fascinating Chemistry between
Harrison Ford and Sean Connery, and of course John Williams with his enthralling magnificent Music. One of my Favorite movies."
"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is set two years after Raiders of the Lost Ark, and three years after Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Indie (Harrison Ford) and his father, Professor Henry Jones (Sean Connery), find themselves in a globe-trotting adventure to find the Holy Grail before the Nazis can get their hands on it.
The film is quite exciting and very funny. It had a much lighter tone and lower violence than the previous films. It's also funnier than the others.
The actors do a good job, especially Sean Connery. He provides such humour to both his role and the film. Many people criticise the Indie-Henry relationship in the film. I think it's the best damn relationship/interaction in the whole series!
The Last Crusade is in my opinion the equal of Raiders."
"Classic adventure story by Steven Spielberg. 10 out of 10. Pure Gold. Spielberg made the mold with this bristling ruptuous vivacious excuberunt quest for the wholy grail.Joyous from beginning to end. Victorious. And hilarously funny. Everything, young or old, could wish for in an adventure story.""The Last Crusade"" is straightforward simple but made so incredibly well: the acting is superb, the stunts are over the top, the story is what childdreams are made of, the photography is gorgeous, the soundtrack by John Willliams is heavenly.The Last Crusade has stood the test of time: it is to this very day by far one of the very best adventure stories ever made!"
"1st watched 4/6/2002 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Steven Spielberg): Fun action and witty dialogue abound in this final(we think...) episode in the Indiana Jones three-some.  What this movie lacked as far as special effects it didn't lack in the witty charm brought to the screen by the pairing of Connery & Ford.  From the very beginning to the end it's hard to keep your eyes of the screen following these outrageous adventures and that's the allure of this series.  This film actually tried to put some serious spiritiual overtones into the storyline by searching for the Holy Grail(the cup that Jesus drank from at the last supper) and the myth that it would give everlasting life to those who drank from it.  There are the usual puzzles and hoops that Indiana has to go through to finish this journey(which make no sense from a realistic perspective), but it's obvious from the very beginning that we're watching an un-realistic hero in a movie and that's okay.  All in all this one is a fun ride for the movie-goer which is the ultimate purpose in this one by the ever-entertaining Steven Spielberg."
"The third and the best of the adventures of Indiana Jones. In this new film, the famous archeologist is searching for a mythical object: ""the Graal"". This is the glass in which the Christ would have drank during the last meal with his apostles. His father assists him in his investigations because he's got precious information about the Graal. So, a long trip begins and will lead our two heroes from Venice to the Middle East in passing by Berlin. You can guess it, this trip has got its rough patches (otherwise the movie would appear devoid of interest). Indeed, the Nazis wish to discover the Graal too because it would make them powerful even dangerous.Steven Spielberg designed his movie like a fascinating treasure hunt and he had the good idea by bringing Sean Connery. Thanks to his presence, the movie's got a certain humor (perhaps a little too convenient but the result works) and allows to lighten the movie.""Indiana Jones and the last crusade"" is also a good surprise because it wipes out the unhappy memory of the previous movie: ""Indiana Jones and the temple of doom"". I found it too horrendous, bloody and even annoying due to Kate Capshaw. Here, to film Indiana Jones' incredible adventures, Spielberg adopted a dramatic and especially efficient film-making. He also avoids all that could make the movie fall in the faults quoted in the second movie. Moreover, there aren't any injury times, the rhythm is skilfully sustained (particularly during the pursuits) and it's better this way because the result is very convincing. Obviously, the movie doesn't go without a few unlikelinesses.Spielberg also brilliantly used the good old recipes for the adventure film: weird and exotic sceneries, the struggle between good and evil, the magic object that possesses supernatural powers etc...The only criticism I have to make of Spielberg is that the screenplay is perhaps well boosted but it doesn't also succeed in hiding a certain manicheism: the Nazis wish to get rid of Jones and his father and to discover the Graal would help them to satisfy their strength.An adventure movie entertaining enough to sustain the interest and rather well performed. Let's add the imposing music (as usual) composed by John Williams."
"I always thought 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' was a great movie and I gave it a rating of A-. I'm surprised that I enjoyed 'Temple of Doom' more than the first one and gave it an A+. I was looking forward to 'The Last Crusade' and now, its pretty evident how much I loved it 'The Last Crusade' joins the adventure of Indiana Jones once more who is on a rescue mission to rescue his father, Henry Jones, who went missing on his search for the Holy Grail. This film is purely brilliant in every way possible. The story is the best of three. The characters in this movie are much better than they are in the first two, even though I like the villain in the second one more than I did in the first one and this one. The musical score by John Williams in this movie is to me, the best its ever been and feels even more magical than the first two. The characters and story are engaging, the movie is directed and written almost perfectly and overall, the movie is very comedic in its tone but also serious, with two such opposing tones mixing together perfectly! There are so many amazing sequences that clearly demonstrate just how amazing the art of film making was back in the glory days. There are so many scenes that are filmed amazingly, the visual effects looking great and the action sequences looking better than most CGI crap today. The film is well aware to not be over the top but is instead a perfect blend of just the right amount of everything necessary to make a movie great.There are however a few goofy scenes with Henry Jones but this is so easily forgotten as everything else in the movie is beyond the credibility of film making.In conclusion, I can easily draw the review down to this and say that this movie is an absolute must see but is always best to watch the first two and come into this. Every aspect of film making is easily surpassed in this masterpiece. Must see A++ In my Top 10 all time favorite movies!"
"The first time I saw this was 1989 at the cinema with my dad in 1989 I thought this as brilliant, a great ending to the trilogy. He was only 4o.
Tonight I'm in a different place. I am 40 with my kids watching it on the bbc at Xmas with me. The magic and adventure is still as good as back in 1989. Ok the effects are a little dated from time to time but in genaral it still holds up.Not as goods as raiders of the lost ark but a very good and entertaining to a saga.A true classic in every sly sense which has and will stand the test of time."
"How often does a third entry to an American produced English language franchise, often worked to spin money irregardless of the critical consensus, sag and just generally disappoint? It is, in that case, a great credit to the team behind this, the third Indiana Jones film of 1989 entitled ""The Last Crusade"", and the fact they done what they've done in creating something as fun and as refreshing as what we've got. We've all been here before, what with the then-latest hijinks preceded by something like four hours of romping; globe trotting; intermittent Nazi-thwarting period-set archaeological causality, but Spielberg doesn't just tread ground: he offers fresh character dynamics; addresses some rather personal issues that affect those caught up in the film's adventure and does his utmost to include action sequences that are every bit as exciting as what preceded them without ever necessarily mirroring them. Where other franchises have in the past faltered through repetition by this stage, Spielberg's film offers fresh wit and flair towards what is essentially the same theme park ride gone again.After the grim fatuity of 1984's Temple of Doom, The Last Crusade slots into a more carefree and relaxed approach to the ""Jones"" material by initially harking back to the man's youth for the opening in a dusty 1912 Utah. In doing so, the messy and misjudged series of bleak horror-shows that was the second entry are somewhat banished and there is this sense of the franchise thus reverting back to all the fun and frolics imbued within that of Raiders of the Lost Ark. The film makes a point to get across the tenaciousness and professionalism of Jones, covering the very first time the character happened upon the need for such characteristics with a delightful array of episodes set aboard a freight train hoarding varying circus acts. He looses a piece of treasure in '12, but gets it back again aboard a large ship on stormy waters in '38 - establishing his skills in combat in the process and how he doesn't necessarily let a loose end pass him by: he's willing to go to the ends of the Earth, it seems, if it means getting that 'just' cause settled.Back home in the American present, life as a university lecturer is draining and the students are demanding. He stands in his class room understating his profession, telling his class that the majority of the pastime is the reading of books and that romanticism has no place in the subject, citing that ""X never, ever marks the spot"". After a series of loosely connected events, Jones is bumped back onto the track spawning adventure and danger thus essentially allowing him to undertake a quest which will go some way to quell these negative emotions through which he expresses about his living. In wanting to get away from his students, there is an opportunity to rekindle that 'spark' and this lies with taking up the challenge to go after The Holy Grail, within which the blood of Chirst was captured as he lay there on the cross at his crucifixion: a goal outlined to him by American Walter Donovan (Glover). The decision teeters over from being a professional one to a personal one when it's revealed his father, Sean Connery's Henry, was swiped by some rivals gunning for the Grail given his credentials in the Grail's makeup and ancient history.Things begin in Venice where splashes of exposition and a good boat chase give way to some suspicions about who's on whose side when elegant German Elsa Schneider (Doody) pops up and seems very keen to guide Indiana through the initial mire. Around about this time, we're provided with a trademark series 'bit' involving rats and human-beings in a tight, centuries old underground place one cannot escape from. We've had bugs; spiders and snakes in the previous films: rats ought to do it this time. Charging across Europe to Austria, father Henry joins the quest and makes for what is probably the best sidekick so far; blowing the likes of the previous entry's Capshaw character and Short Round out of the water and probably topping Allen's from the first. Throughout, the Jones' aren't really on speaking terms and both Ford and Connery bounce off one another really well as these two scholars of archaeology acting as one another's foils: Henry being a man of a more refined and old fashioned sort therein the pastime but clashing head on with Indiana's serial-action hero approach to things.Fleeting substance between the two of them begins in the form of a brief moment on an airship when some truths from years ago rear up, and how Henry was seemingly more in love with his finding of the grail than of his own family. Spielberg's insistence on shooting Connery in the way that he does during the 1912 prologue goes some way to emphasise his anonymity in Indiana's life at that specific time; and without wanting to give anything away, the key denouement in their relationship happens much later on when Henry is forced into uttering the words ""let it go...."" at a crucial time when the decision between putting family before what has since been revealed as a pipe dream plays out. The film is a winner, a franchise entry that sticks in the mind thanks largely to its central pairing; its humour; its action sequences and its off-piste scenes such as the one at a Nazi rally when a certain man's autograph is captured. In a sense, this is probably better than Raiders; the film cracks along at the same sort of pace but there just seems to be more stuff going on here with the capability of leaving a big grin on your face and not have you feel too bad about it. Where Spielberg has garnered praise in the past for his romping, B-movie inclined entertainments, he deserves a little more with this effort."
"When RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK was released, my high school buddy and I were the first one in line. We had no idea what the film was about but we wanted to see something fun and spectacular. Well, we weren't disappointed. I remember this experience fondly.So when I saw INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE when it was released at the movies, I couldn't believe how terrible and pathetic it was from beginning (trite flashback to Indy's youth) to miserable end (sexist death of the sole female character in the whole film).Let's start with the beginning. Then again, maybe not. River Phoenix was totally miscast as the young Indiana Jones. He just doesn't look like he's having fun at all. And to have Indy go through a number of incidents that took place at one time that explains Indy's fear of snakes, his hat, his whip, etc, was so bleeding obvious and badly conceived that I thought it was a parody. But it's not. It's played straight. After seeing that beginning, I knew I was going to suffer much more. And suffer, I did.Practically every aspect of what made the first film so fun and memorable was ruined by the terrible screenplay by Jeffrey Boam. The film is just a collection of crude in-jokes, a boat-load of silly coincidences, badly conceived action scenes (most of them echoing and relying on those from the first film), a story filled with so many mistakes and gargantuan plot-holes, sprinkled with forced comedy bits and all wrapped up in a neat package that made Paramount happy. The fact is, this was a stinker, and they knew it. The series, only after three movies, had already ran out of steam and it ended after this one. Everything felt forced in LAST CRUSADE. Harrison Ford looked bored. Like Phoenix, Sean Connery was miscast as Indy's father. The only reason they hired Connery was to make a link with the Indy series and the James Bond series. Nothing else. Connery added nothing to the series. But the worst aspect of this turkey was its only female character. In the first Indiana Jones, Marion was an equal to Indy. She was spunky, tough and cute. In LAST CRUSADE, Alison Doody plays Elsa, an unpleasant blond NAZI bitch who dies a miserable death at the end. Pretty sad when you think about it.The action throughout the movie was as compelling as a Tom & Jerry cartoon. Case in point, when Connery scares the birds on the beach and makes them fly directly in front of a plane, in order to bring the plane down. Not only is this scene stupid but it's really crass re: the birds' welfare. The coincidences were so moronic and such groaners (Indy bumping into Hitler) that I've never done so much eye rolling during the viewing of of a single film. Had this been the first Indiana Jones film, it would have flopped because it relies so much on RAIDERS' coat tails that if you haven't seen the first one, it wouldn't make much sense. After the bad experience that was TEMPLE OF DOOM, INDIANA JONES & THE LAST CRUSADE was the last straw and my enthusiasm for this ""series"" completely evaporated. That was 18 years ago. Now I hear they're doing an Indy 4. They shouldn't bother with it. Put a fork in it. It's done."
"There are loads of ""action-adventure"" films out there. There are just a select few that combine history and intrigue. Then there are the greats - the ones that combine all of the above, and Nazi bad-guys. And they are called the Indiana Jones Trilogy. Raiders of the Lost Ark is a fantastic film. Temple of Doom is disappointing at best (although there are some great comedic moments - it just isn't in line with the other two films). The best, in my opinion, is Last Crusade. It isn't just that Harrison Ford and Sean Connery have such excellent on-screen chemistry as father and son. Or that the comedy bits are so fun. Nor the brilliant ending... No - what makes it so fantastic is that no film made since has even come close to being as good as this film in any respect. It is the pinnacle of ""scholarly"" action-adventure films. Sorry ""National Treasure"" and ""Sahara"" - you just don't stack up. ""DiVinci Code"" won't either. Take my advice - Netflix the Indiana Jones Trilogy and see for yourself."
"Messy, even ridiculous, tribute to the James Bond films of the 1960s, and a disastrous finale to the original Indiana Jones series.Like the locations, the plot is all over the map. Well, sure adventure films should travel the globe easily - but there ought to be a reason for it. The clues leading to the final discovery really have nothing to do with one another, are forced into patterns that really make no sense, and are simply used as excuses to drag the characters from England to Germany to Italy to Egypt - well, eventually, we loose track of just where.Ford and Connery ham it up something fierce. The sets look like sets. The cinematography is second rate. The editing is competent and not much else. Spielberg seems to have fallen asleep in the director's chair quite a bit (""uh, are we making a movie? why didn't you wake me up?"") The ending: pseudo-Christian pseudo-Mystical blather, not at all in keeping with any Christian mythos or morality, and dependent on B-movie puzzle solving, pratfalls, and cliff-hanging that utterly debase the mythic references to cheap rumors about possible gods.This is cynical cash-in of the worst variety; stay away."
"In my view, the best of the series by a country mile. Action-packed adventure cinema at the top of it's game. Harrison Ford and Alison Doody provide the foundations in an engaging and sexy way and allow Denholm Elliott; John Rhys-Davies and, of course, a series defining Sean Connery as ""Professor Henry Jones"" with such a glint in his eye to add all the icing to a very, very good cake. John Williams provides a cracking score to complement the creativity of Messrs. Spielberg and Boam's words and images. What's not to like?"
"The last crusade is one hell of a ending of awesome trilogy and it defienetly ends with a bang,for me last crusade is by far the most funniest film of all three,which is mostly achived by ford and connery corky and funny relationship and their just mere presance,for some people it has problem by copying plot of first one,but since i really loved first for me it wasnt flaw at all,cause it added also a lot of new things,it also showed that lighthearted tone is better for this kind of films instead darker like temple of doom,at becase of that this film surpasses easly the previous one"
"So Raiders is the OG the classic no matter what but IMO Last Crusade hits those high notes like Raiders and even goes higher.Pros.
-Score is top notch (Holy Grail, Raiders March)
-Clear Story to follow
-Sean Connery and Harrison Ford have great chemistry for father/son
-Sallah Returns and is always fun to see with Indy
-Good Twist for villain
-The Chases in this movie have their comedy and are awesome
-Ending is one of my favorite endings to any movie
-Tank scene has you at the edge of your seat
-Pacing was insanely goodCons.
-Didn't like the 1st scene with Indy young felt way too draggedOverall this 3rd adventure to this wonderful universe with always be my favorite for its score, characters, story, action and so much more that makes me believe that this is the Holy Grail of adventure movies."
"From my perspective, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade's the best of the Indiana Jones movie series and it's always been my favourite, as well as one of my favourite Steven Spielberg movies. It has constant adrenaline-rushing moments, great chemistry between Harrison Ford and Sean Connery, gives more screen time to Sallah and Marcus, introduces a great character in Henry Jones Senior, has great action sequences and provides some of the best laughs of the franchise."
"Of the Indiana Jones films the first, and the third are my favorites. Having watched the film again just now, I am perplexed by the ending. I've watch this film hundreds of times and always: ""went along for the ride"" but for whatever reason I was struck to wonder this.
The Knight with a look on his face of disappointment (waiting 700 years for someone worthy to take his place) raises his hand in farewell.
Really? He should have been giving our heros the middle single finger salute. He waited 700 years, healed Indy's father, and despite warning them, they bungle up the temple?
Okay, sooooo what now? Did the chamber put itself back together again? You know, a divine reset, or something like that? What about the Knight himself? He can't die, he's immortal, and you can't sell me that the cup was lost forever, I don't buy it. There's a reason for that cup being where it was. After all isn't the Ark still stored away in some storage warehouse?Nope, the alternate ending inside the cave, (Behind the behind the scenes) shows the Knight holding out his hand, reclaiming the cup as the temple puts itself back into divine order to await the next worthy successor. Thus the dust outside the Temple to fool our heros into thinking it was dsetryed.
Oh, and the Knight? Patience, always patients.I think there is an angle for another movie that would tie up all these loose ends."
"Loved it as a child even more so as an adult. Honestly can't think of another film which comes close. The humour, adventure, action, all beautifully orchestrated with the fantastic score from John Williams. Wish movies were made like this, movies at their best!!"
"The last crusade is probably one of the best action adventure movies of all time, following from what i consider an ok film temple of doom, the last crusade brings plenty of thrilling action set pieces and the story is top notch, plenty of twists and turns and plenty of Nazis to punch, lets not forget Sean Connery as Indi's dad he is the heart of the film. the last crusade has it all, the action, the laughs and the heart of a great adventure."
"Not much to say, just go watch it, this movie is fenomenal. Every single character is extremely fun to watch, Indiana Jones' relationship with his father is hilarious and every single second of this movie is, not only very entertaining, but also memorable. George Lucas and Steven Spielberg (in there good days) were masters on creating memorable and intriguing scenes. In it's combination of great soundtrack, great characters, great art direction and great action sequences, this movie gets on the top of the top, my list of favorite films. I'm even kind of sad that movies like this aren't released anymore."
"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is set two years after Raiders of the Lost Ark, and three years after Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Indie (Harrison Ford) and his father, Professor Henry Jones (Sean Connery), find themselves in a globe-trotting adventure to find the Holy Grail before the Nazis can get their hands on it. The film is quite exciting and very funny. It had a much lighter tone and lower violence than the previous films. It's also funnier than the others. The actors do a good job, especially Sean Connery. He provides such humour to both his role and the film. Many people criticise the Indie-Henry relationship in the film. I think it's the best damn relationship/interaction in the whole series! The Last Crusade is in my opinion the equal of Raiders."
"In my opinion, this is the third and the best Indiana Jones movie, and the one of my favourite movies of all time. The Last Cursade is like Raiders of the Lost Ark. It has the archeology and adventure fun and fast tempo storytelling like Raiders of the Lost Ark, but there is one difference: it is greater.While following a similar format as Raiders of the Lost Ark, the Last Cursade adds more action sequences, more humour, more greater scale, more fun characters, more emotion, more character development, more backstory, and countless other elements that makes a sequel great, even greater than the original. The chemistry with Indiana Jones and his father Henry is great, there are many laughs, and the chases are more grand and more greater than the original.This could have been a perfect ending to this incredible film series, the phrase ""ending with a bang"" will be actually appropriate. We of course know what happened with the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull crap, but overall, this is a great, fun movie which is the best of the Indiana Jones movies and one of my personal favourites. I strongly recommend this movie to those who haven't watched it."
"While I am addicted to many franchises , I reserve my critique to the part or episode which appeals to me the most. I do pick my battles hence to conserve energy and preserve my sanity as well, I do this selective critique method . The tandem of Harrison Ford as Indy and Sean Connery ( ah the man) as Indy Senior is such a hilariously insane , watermelon combination. Like a watermelon both men are hard on the surface but crack it and what you get is pink-reddish , sweet , succulent fruit, just like these two as Father and Son. The highlight with the Last Knight and the message of sacrifice for family puts a small internal tear with all of us viewers. Solid gold entertainment ."
"Many say that this is the saving grace of the Indiana Jones saga after Temple of Doom. And I most certainly agree. It's got its parallels with Raiders (ie a biblical artifact, agents of the Third Reich, and of course John Rhys-Davies, who is one of my favorite actors), plus Sean Connery as the dad. Aside from that, this also features one of my favorite sites in the whole Middle East. Just watch and see what I mean. For me, this is one of the better father-son movies. Sure they fight a lot but what parent-child duo doesn't? Maybe they should play this movie more on Father's Day. That would prove that not all father-son relationships are as bad as they seem. As for me, this is my favorite Indiana Jones movie. A lot of the actors from Star Wars are in here, including Julian Glover (who played General Veers), Harrison Ford (Han Solo!), and the late Michael Sheard (who played the first guy Darth Vader strangled in The Empire Strikes Back). And this is the only River Phoenix movie I've seen. He did well as a younger Indy. If you have to see one Indy movie, give this a go!"
"The Indiana Jones trilogy concludes with this epic face off between Indiana Jones and the Third Reich. Sean Connery gives a terrific performance as Indiana's father and really adds class to the film. The film is exciting and mystifying, dealing with highly mysterious religious mythology and artifacts.The religious aspect of the film definitely adds to the thrill of the movie, but it's carefully not overdone. The enemy Nazis are very real and Indiana is as down to Earth as always, with refreshing and smart writing throughout the film.The cast is brilliant, with a welcome addition of John Rhys Davies. The score is sweeping and epic. Everything seems to come together for Indiana and his crew at the end of the original trilogy. Great film all around. Great adventure for all."
I love Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. It's one of the best father and son moments in movies. The action is great and I've seen this many times. I loved every scene in this film including the chase scenes. I even liked the part when Donovan drinks the wrong grail and turning into a skeleton. It was almost like Donovan turning into a zombie. The final boss was Donovan's skeleton in Indiana Jones' Greatest Adventures and I played the game many times. The special effects of Donovan decaying and turning into the skeleton was great. The part that I liked was when Indy pushes Donovan's skeleton into the wall and it crumbles into pieces. They did a great job with the effects like always. I loved the ending when Indy and the rest ride off into the sunset. It is still the greatest classic for the franchise.10/10 stars
"Thanks to Blu-ray, I've been revisiting the Indiana Jones movies and have just sat through The Last Crusade. Now, I never much cared for this when it came out, but how on earth this claptrap can have such a high rating on IMDb is a mystery. Maybe Spielberg was trying to make a ""Carry on"" film. This could have been titled Abbott and Costello and the Holy Grail, with it's pathetic attempts at humour. Connery is about as convincing as Ford's father as Jessie Royce Landis was as Cary Grant's mother in North by Northwest. And strange though it may seem, in 1938 it was illegal to kill German soldiers in cold blood, which Indiana Jones does with reckless abandon, and without any official sanction (at least James Bond had a licence to kill). Groan inducing scene follows groan inducing scene until the thing grinds to a halt, unfortunately at least forty five minutes too late."
"""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" is the third film in the series and is very close, in terms of greatness, to the original.  This time Indiana (Harrison Ford) goes after the holy grail, a remnant that the pre-World War II Nazis are trying to obtain.  Sean Connery co-stars as Indiana's father and adds a great wrinkle to the series.  The screenplay is not quite as good as the original's, but the excitement and interest is kept at a fevered-pitch throughout.  Once again Spielberg's direction is the key element that makes the film an overall success.  4.5 out of 5 stars."
"The addition of Sean Connery was presumably intended to add depth to Indy's character. It really just led to tedious ""humorous"" interplay between the two, generally dragging the plot to a thudding stop. This, plus Alison Doody - easily the least distinguished leading lady of the series - and an incoherent plot that veers all over Europe and the Middle East with little dramatic gain, leaves a forgettable film. ""Raiders"" evokes images of 1930s and '40s-era adventure films - only with better production values. ""Temple of Doom"" is like a carnival ride - even to the point of including a runaway mine train! ""Last Crusade""? Ultimately forgettable."
"Even though I don't believe the public needed an apology for the Temple of Doom they just wanted one and Lucas felt obligated to hand one out. This movie is deliberately light hearted and more in tune with the first installment of the trilogy. Ford is great as always and so is Sean Connery even though if he was Harrison's father he would have been 12 when Ford was born. Jones is once again pitted against the most evil force known to man, the Nazis. This time they are coveting the most precious religious artifact in all of Christendom the Holy Grail. So Jones and son must race against the Huns to reclaim it before Hitler drinks out of it and lives forever only to discover that he unknowingly gave Indy a sample of his handwriting which will be used as evidence against him in his upcoming Nuremberg trial. Action, suspense, intrigue, betrayal, and of course love are all included. Soon to be followed by Indiana Jones IV which is hitting theaters summer of 2006 and will feature a 60 year old almost Social Security eligible Harrison Ford and a much updated plot line."
"Still wondering how this movie, INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE (1989) is so revered in the Indiana Jones ""trilogy"". Yeah, I'm not counting Crystal Skull, but not for the reasons people think. It's just that it's painfully obvious that Skull was probably never meant to be made and that it was supposed to all end in 1989 with this movie. There are actually things I like about Skull, but not this copycat of Raiders of the Lost Ark.The movie starts out with a silly, ""childish"" sequence of a Young Indiana Jones (essayed by River Phoenix, who looks NOTHING like a younger version of Harrison Ford) on an exploring trip with his boy scout troop in 1912 Utah, who finds an ancient relic in a cave and is pursued by nefarious villainous types, and goes through all these requisite stunts that mimic action sequences we've already seen in the first 2 movies, but these scenes EXPLAIN Indy's phobias and adult idiosyncrasies. Indy eventually loses the battle, giving up the artifact to the bad guys, but is supposed to have learned a valuable lesson about life....YAWN! We also get a glimpse of Indy's Dad. Flashforward to the film's setting, 1939, where Professor Jones is teaching at university while horny college girls drool over him like a rock star (just like in the original film). Then ANOTHER group of nefarious types approach him about some stone artifact they found in the ocean that is proof of the existence of the Holy Grail, so Indy goes on a trek across the globe (just like in the original film), which encompasses Italy, Germany, and Israel, in search of the Grail. Along for the ride is Indy's Dad Henry Jones (played by Sean Connery in blatant stunt casting), who was the leader of the original mission to find the Grail. And guess how the end up meeting? See, these Nazis are holding Jones Sr. hostage because they are also interested in finding the precious artifact. Does the word ""Nazi"" sound familiar? JUST LIKE IN THE ORIGINAL FILM! I'm sensing a trend here. Also, there is the required female sidekick. Of course, it's never a bad idea to have an attractive lady in a movie, but this one is a stereotypical blonde bimbo who is supposed to be some kind of smart DOCTOR. I've seen half-naked Bond girls who are more convincing as smarties than this chick!Speaking of BOND, back to the stunt casting of Connery! This movie shamelessly plays on Ford and Connery's universal appeal by pairing them as son and father, because they bear absolutely NO resemblance to each other. I can suspend disbelief in a movie like ""Highlander"", because there are so many things that movie has going for it other than just Sean Connery, but not in this movie. He is in no way, shape, or form convincing as Indy's Dad. Ford had way more chemistry with his co-stars in the previous 2 movies. The humor between the 2 actors is very strained and not funny, their dialog composed of endless, annoying bickering.The action in this movie is nothing to write home about either. It's amazing, but I actually thought much of the effects in this movie looked incredibly cheesy! And this movie came out years AFTER the first 2 movies, whose effects to this day look fresh and engaging. Then we have the repetitive battles with Nazis. Now, I actually think that Temple of Doom is the best Indy flick, but Raiders still is entertaining with many positives, and at least the villains in that movie had a panache and mystique about them with talented actors playing them with flair, but the villains in this are incredibly stale with no flair.What boggles my mind even more is that there is a healthy amount of fans that actually think THIS awful movie is the BEST of the original trilogy when it is nothing but a sad clone of the Raiders and not nearly as entertaining as Doom! A case where mindless action wins over real filmmaking. Can't win 'em all!"
"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is not as good as Raiders of the Lost Ark, but it sure beats the crap out of temple of doom and a lot of other films. They brought back everything i missed the Nazi's, Marcus Brody...and just the spirit of the first Indy film and that was everything that was lost intemple of doom. The Chemistry between Indy and his Dad is great and very funny and Sean Connery was the best choice for his dad. There were great action sequences like boat chase scene, the motorbike chase, the Nazi after Indy and Henry all the time and the tank scene. Like the first film Indy is after a christainty artefact, and it's the holy grail. The Story is superb and i loved Elsa she was very smart to trick Indy as to being a Nazi...overall i love this film almost as much as raiders and it's great fun."
"If it wasn't for dumb luck, Indian Jones would have no luck. Indiana, played by Harrison Ford, seems to always end up in the wrong place at the right time. The same is true of the previous 2 installments of this trilogy, we don't talk about the 4th Indiana Jones. The editing in the film is spot on along with the use of the camera to signal the end of a scene and the movie to the next. As is the tradition in all of the films in the trilogy during times of travel a map is used and the stops highlighted with the flight path and the change of direction. This serves well to set the tone that the film will take place in some far way place. I believe that the Indiana Jones trilogy served well to be recreated in the new century as ""National Treasure"". The plot and the character development is the same, right down to the dad who's just not as quick as the main character.
Overall, the film was good. It's a predicable story that is a good blend of fact and fiction. It's the best kind of story, one that blends the fiction elements with the fact and makes it hard to tell the difference."
"When it comes to the most iconic film characters of all time, Indiana Jones is near the top of that list. The amount of unbelievable journeys he has gone on has been unparalleled to say the least. The Last Crusade just adds to the fun with Sean Connery portraying Indi's father. Raiders did a great job in establishing this laid back tone with glimpses of darkness along the way. Where as Temple of Doom in my opinion steered away from the tone of the franchise and never seemed to capture my attention as much as the book ends did. It's very hard at this point to pick which out of the two i liked more, but the franchise is most definitely cemented as one of the greatest of all time.Out of the three The Last Crusade has the most action and the pacing is brilliant. You get a 15-20 scene of chases and adventure and then 10-15 minute of key dialog in the over all story. Much like Big Fish and About Time this film is an adventure film with plenty of mystery, but when it comes down to it, its a story about father and son reconnecting. The story is heartfelt and some of the better acting both Connery and Ford have done. When you get two actors of their caliber you can count on that they will deliver the performances needed to sell this bond between father and son. The film is on the shoulders of those two, and they carried this classic to the very end.It also helps when a movie actually makes you believe the leads are in true danger. With huge franchises it is often tough to sell the audience into thinking our favorite character may actually die, but this film did that. But i can say this film is not without it's problems. While Raiders was special because of the villain, Crusade wasn't anything too spectacular. A villain needs a good back story and motivation to do the things they do. I didn't feel at all intrigued by the Nazi leader. It was just great to see Indi kick his butt in the end. Ford is a movie star so i cant say it wouldn't be great to see him back in the role one day but that time has likely past. They have big shoes to fill but the fan favorites Chris Pratt or Bradley Cooper would do the role justice.+Non stop entertainment+Father-Son duo+Belief that our characters are at risk+Beautifully paced-Weak villain8.5/10"
"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was an action packed, adventurous movie. The character costumes and the settings for the scenes were all appropriate for the 1930's. Early on in the movie, Henry ""Indiana"" Jones Jr., played by Harrison Ford, learns from Walter Donovan that his father Henry Jones, played by Sean Connery, has gone missing while searching for the Grail. One day, Indy receives in the mail his father's diary of all his research and soon realizes that he would not send this to Indy unless something was wrong. The theme throughout this movie shows how a father and sons relationships can be so strong with one mission in common; finding the Holy Grail. Another film that demonstrates a father son's relationship is Field of Dreams starring Kevin Costner. Indy and a local museum owner Marcus Brody, played by Denholm Elliott, travel to Venice in search of Henry. After countless fights, battles, and struggles, Indy is reunited with his father. One thing that I found frustrating with this movie was that the action scenes were so loud and was constantly having to turn the TV down. When it was a calm scene with just the characters talking, I could barely hear them and had to turn the TV back up. This may have been just my version on the movie but I was constantly turning the volume up and down. Indy is told before he leaves for Venice not to trust anyone and learns that very quickly. Indy and his father have to fight to find the Grail themselves with a small amount of help from a few pals. They soon find the temple that holds the Grail after following Henry's clues and research from his diary. As they enter the temple, they find Donovan and Dr. Schneider, who were supposed to be working with Henry as a team to find the Grail. Donovan uses Indy as a chance to get the Grail for himself and use it for his immortality. Donovan shoots Henry and tells Indy that the only way to save his father is to go through the traps and find the Grail. Knowing that his father's diary gave tips and keys to defeat the traps, Indy makes his way through the traps and reaches the Grail chamber successfully. He must choose wisely among a room filled of ancient artifacts as there is only one correct cup. Dr. Schneider chooses one of the cups and gives it to Donovan, fills it with water, and drinks from this ancient cup and soon ages to death. Indy finds the correct one and takes it to his father. Indy pours the water on Henry's wounds and makes him drink some of the water. Henry's wounds are healed. After a quake breaks out, the Grail is lost in a crack and Henry insists on leaving it behind. Indy, Henry and his other two pals ride off into the sunset.Overall, this was a very good movie and I would highly recommend it to everyone. I honestly didn't think I was going to like it and have never seen any of the Indiana Jones. I am glad that I watched this movie. Through the power and importance of a father and a son's bond and love, anything can be accomplished and by sticking together through hard times, it builds a relationship and can make it stronger."
"What could be better than seeing what led to the whip and the hat that became the trade mark of our hero; what could be better than seeing Indiana Jones on a quest with his father and probably his mentor as they face odds and spiritual powers in high places.The thing that makes Indiana Jones movies a must watch is that it crosses various genres like action, adventure, thriller and spiritual/supernatural. Making sure that the viewer is intrigued by the blend. The father and son relationship is one blend that Spielberg did well as it was never a dull moment with the duo.The chase scene in the train where we get to see young Indy in boys scout uniform is one scene that I very much applaud, as it does not play on your intelligence, and it explored the realms of revealing some of the attributes of Indy and what led to them.Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is directed by the legendary director Steven Spielberg who had to drop out of directing Big and Rain Man so as to fulfill his promise of making this movie with executive producer George Lucas.The Last Crusade is the third installment (and was meant to be the last) in the Indiana Jones franchise.The raiders of the Lost Ark was the best of the best when it comes to the Indiana Jones series as Temple of Doom fell short of the pedigree that the previous delivered, Last Crusade was taken through writes and re-writers so that it can serve as an apology to fans and win back their love for the whip and the hat Although to me Temple of Doom is not as bad as some say.The movie plot is centered on the Holy Grail. It starts with an introduction to a younger Indy (played by the late River Phoenix), where we get to see things that made Indy who he is like what led to his fear of snakes.It moves from there to a classroom where Indy is teaching his students and was drawn away from his teaching again to embark on another adventure, to find the Holy Grail and his missing father. His adventure led to Nazi involvement as they want the Holy Grail and the eternal life that comes with it.Shot in Spain, Italy, England, Turkey and Jordan, the movie was a financial success, earning over $474,000,000 in the box office and it went home with an Academy Award for Best Sound Editing.Here is one Indiana Jones you don't want to miss.www.lagsreviews.com"
"The third in a series of Indiana Jones films, INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE is a testament to the team of Harrison Ford and Sean Connery who provide us with two hours of entertainment on a grand scale, thanks to some fine direction from Steven Spielberg and a rollicking good script. The duo exchange some lively banter in a believable way, bringing more depth to both characters and making us care more about their adventures.Keeping the Holy Grail out of the clutches of the Nazis is what makes the story click from the start, with adventures that range from sea to desert to majestic mountain hideaways, all while Indy and his dad are hotly pursued by the Nazis anxious to get their hands on the cup that promises immortality.A good supporting cast is on hand to give the story all the excitement it generates, including Denholm Elliot as a clueless professor and Alison Doody as an adventuress who seems to be helping the Nazis but turns against them at a crucial moment until her own greed works against her fate.All of it is filmed at a breathtaking pace, never stopping long enough to make you dwell on flaws in the logic of Indy's cliffhanging escapes and fights with Nazis aboard tanks in the desert. But aside from action, the script provides plenty of insight into the relationship between father and son, peppered with some witty dialog.All ages should enjoy this one, about as good as the original Indy film with the addition of Sean Connery providing bits of warmth and humor as dad to the world's most beloved archaeologist."
"Given that action and adventure is the series' selling point, you can expect the thrills and wondrous delight of discovery delivered in spades. The action scenes are terrific (and matched well with John Williams' rousing, memorable score, also the best of the trilogy), the best being a fantastic ten-minute chase sequence on board (and in) a tank, possibly the best action sequence of Spielberg's career. I also loved the motorcycle chase and the Zeppelin setpiece, where the heroes go about dispatching of two enemy fighters in unexpected, but quite hilarious, fashion. The climax, complete with frightening booby traps, is a suspenseful venture into the unknown.The Last Crusade is far more humor-oriented than its predecessors, but part of the movie's effectiveness is that it's able to deliver belly laughs without defusing the tension during the action sequences. Some of the jokes are just brilliant, including one with Indy armed with a Luger in confrontation with a trio of Nazis on board a tank that's even funnier than the swordsman scene in Raiders (well, to me, at least).The supporting cast is all-around superb; John Rhys-Davies is back as Sallah, wonderful as ever and displaying a bit more enthusiasm searching for the Grail than he did digging up the Ark of the Covenant. The late Denholm Elliot also returns as Marcus Brody, the most lovable goof of a museum curator. Alison Doody is interesting as Elsa, the blonde historian whom Indy falls for; a twist involving her character and her actions towards the climax make her not as one-dimensional as she may initially appear. Julian Glover is the best of the main Indy villains, he's far more menacing than Paul Freeman's Belloq and less over-the-top but equally enjoyable as Amrish Pruri's Mola Ram. I also enjoyed Michael Byrne's performance as the Jones hating Colonel Vogel, who relishes in torturing Indy and his father. When it comes to pure delightfully nasty villainy, Byrne is even more fun to watch than Glover."
"""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" was made in 1989 and bristles with excitement, humor, suspense, special effects and, as a real plus, character development. In the beginning we get to see young Indy (River Phoenix) and where he got his fear of snakes, etc., and we meet his father, Henry Jones (Sean Connery), a brilliant professor.In this story, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) leaves his teaching job to again save the world from the Nazis. They have kidnapped Indy's father for his diary. The Nazis seek nothing less than the Holy Grail, for which Henry Jones has maps and notations in his diary which can lead to it. The Holy Grail here is a chalice used by Jesus at the Last Supper, received by Joseph of Arimathea and said to possess miraculous powers. Joseph used the Grail to catch Christ's blood while interring him. It's up to Indy to free his father.Directed by Steven Spielberg, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade takes the audience on a thrilling journey to Venice, Austria, Germany and remote locations. The film never lets up its fast pace and around every corner, there's a special effect, or funny dialogue, or a brilliant escape.The great cast also includes Julian Glover, John Rhys-Davies, Denholm Elliott, and Alison Doody."
"Dumping the set-like feel of Temple of Doom and going for location shoot of Raiders Steven Spielberg's vision looks fantastic. There's no denying that some of the effects have dated and Jeffrey Boam's script a little heavy on the comedy, but George Lucas and Menno Meyjes story is exciting and intricate. In this quest Indiana Jones must rescue his kidnapped father and stop the Nazis that are in search of the Holy Grail.Although a little forced the cute flash back opening has exciting gusto as you see the influences on young Indy (played by River Phoenix) that turned him into Indiana the man.The casting is note worthy, Alison Doody as Dr. Elsa Schneider is wonderful, playing the perfect Austrian (even though she's Irish). Harrison Ford is once again flawless in the title role, a part that he was made for. Sean Connery is exceptional as Indy's father and familiar faces return including John Rhys-Davies' Sallah and Denholm Elliott's Marcus Brody. My only complaint is that Brody's character is far more comical than he comes across in the first adventure.With John Williams familiar fantastic score, coupled with globe trotting adventure and action set pieces galore, Last Crusade is an exciting must see classic."
"The third part of the Indiana Jones series, The Last Crusade, is a wonderful Jones film. It has everything. It has excitement, humor, and lots of fun. Harrison Ford returns as Indiana Jones. This time, he must go on a search for his father, who was kidnapped looking for a passage way in a library in Venice. For years, Jones's father(Sean Connery) has kept a grail diary, and has gone looking for the Holy Grail. Jones teams up with his friend Marcus(Denholm Elliot)and Elsa(Allison Doody) to find his father. But once he finds his father, other things start to happen. Marcus is kidnapped and people aren't who they seem. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is a fantastic experience. It's in second place for the Indiana Jones films. The Indiana Jones films are wonderful experiences. Like the original ,which, like this one, is one of my favorites, it mixes Adventure, religion, and, well, not quite romance all in one film. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is an awesome film that doesn't disappoint. It's inventive, smart, entertaining, fun, and funny. I loved Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade very much."
"Third Times A Charm!! 19 December 2005 Author:littlehammer16787 from TexasA great Indy prequel that is prehaps second best.Brave adventurer Indiana Jones teams up with his father and go after the holy grail.Ford is gold as always playing fearless hero Indiana Jones.Sean Connery is his bookish, cantankerous father Henry Jones.Denholm Elliott portrays zany,but highly intelligent Marcus Brody.Davies returns as Indy's loyal,virtuous Egyptian friend Sallah. Allison Doody plays the double-edged role of the devious female villain Elsa Schneider.Julian Glover plays the corrupt art dealer Walter Donovan. A truly great prequel that delivers another ancient,religious discovery thriller."
"Harrison Ford has become one of my favorite actors, and this is yet another movie where he shines. In this third (and possibly final) installment in the Indiana Jones series, Jones (Ford) has been invited to an associates house to translate an ancient tablet. When he translates it, he finds that it is a key to finding the holy grail; that's when he learns that his father (Sean Connery) has already begun the search. Throughout his quest to find his father, and then the grail, Jones encounters unforgettable villains, evil Nazis, and lovable allies, and when you add in lots of adventure, great dialogue, and the bonding between Indie and his dad, you have one of the greatest adventure movies of all time. I would highly recommend it to anyone who has seen Raiders of the Lost Ark, or anyone who loves a great adventure movie with a strong plot, or for anyone who just loves Harrsion Ford.10 out of 10."
"This is, in my opinion, the best Indy film of the series. It is a terrific action movie with bits of humor. The character of Indiana Jones is further developed in this movie. Sean Connery and Harrison Ford work wonderful as ""father and son"". This idea of ""father and son"" adds humor to the wonderful story. What makes this entry slightly different then the two previous films is that Indy is not only searching for the Holy Grail but he is also searching for a antiquity that is more rare then the Holy Grail or any of the artifacts he was searching for in the predecessors, Indy is searching for his father. The music is good. The acting is great especially Sean Connery's performance as Dr. Henry Jones. Do yourself a favor and watch this classic."
"Both this film and Raiders of the Lost Ark are exciting and funny at the same time, in the days when movies could be both, but the Last Crusade is a more modern film, and is therefore more polished. The cast are terrific, and in a way, Harrison Ford is the odd one out, as he is surrounded by many British actors. There is a grandiose feeling about it, and the music amplifies this feeling. It is a bit of a shame that there could be a fourth, as it will have to go a long way to beat this."
"They don't make films like this anymore. It feels genuine, it feels solid and it feels adventurous in a way that no other film has been able to copy. I love the third Indiana Jones for several reasons - but the main one is: the feeling it evokes.The adventure film is a dying concept. The last one to date to really fit into the adventure-genre, ""Cutthroat Island"", didn't work out very well. It had the right feeling, and I kind of liked it. But adventure doesn't really work these days.But with Indiana Jones, it's different. Indiana Jones is set in the perfect time (what other villains are better than nazis, evil Indians or just plain crooks?), has great timing and takes great care to assure that the adventure - i.e. traveling, meeting people, solving tricky problems and gaining something in the end - feels real. To do so, one needs humor (supplied by the animosity between Jones and his father, aptly played by Connery), magic (good ole Christian legends of eternal life) and a villain.The very best part of this film is when Jones faces Hitler and gets his autograph in his fathers notebook - at a book burning fest in Berlin... Great fun."
"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade starts with a great opening scene and never lets up afterwards. River Phoenix is cast as the young Indy and he does a terrific job. There's a great chase on the top of a train and a neat little reminder of how Indy received that scar on his chin. The opening, however, is just the start of a fantastic journey that involves Nazi's, a dogfight with fighter planes, and a well done journey into the lair of the Holy Grail. The screenplay, written by Jeffrey Boam, is terrific. It has the right amount of comedy one-liners and adventure to hold your attention for 2 hours. I have to comment on this character of Indiana Jones again. Harrison Ford plays this character so perfectly that he almost made me forget Han Solo and George Lucas has created one of the most memorable characters in the modern cinema. Steven Spielberg seems very comfortable with the character and the stories. I'm hoping for a new Indiana Jones picture soon."
"What can one say, with 2 stars of the stellar magnitude of Sean Connery and Harrison Ford at their peak, what could go wrong? Nothing goes wrong in this jim-dandy adventure film. It's packed with excitement, humor, and suspense. From first to last, a totally wonderful experience. I have watched time and again and not grown tired of this film.YOU MUST SEE IT!"
"Steven Spielberg did it again, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is not only the Best Indiana Jones film, it's also one of the best films ever made. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade stars Harrison Ford and Sean Connery (don't worry I'll get to Sean Connery later) These two were casted perfectly, if you don't know who they are you might think that they are father and son, that's how good the chemistry is between them. The acting is brilliant in the film, and usually Indy would be the scene stealer like the first two, but no Indy's father Henry Jones steals every scene that they are in, Sean Connery did a spectacular performance, literally his second best Performance of his career (right behind James Bond of Course), he is hilarious resourceful and truthfully he deserved an Oscar Nomination for his performance in this film it's that good. The Villain in this film Walter Donovan is the second best Villain in the Trilogy (not counting Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) right behind Rene Belloq, and that is awesome, the story in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is incredible, and finally the soundtrack is amazing. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is not Only the Best Indiana Jones film, but one of my Favorite films of all time #6 to be precise. If you haven't seen The Last Crusade yet, go watch it NOW!!!!+ Great Acting+ Amazing Story+ Sean Connery+ Harrison Ford's and Sean Connery's chemistry as Father and Son+ Great Villain+ Awesome Rewatchability+ Amazing Intro+ Amazing Outro+ Great Soundtrack+ CompellingFinal Score 10/10 Legendary!!! Epic Win :)"
"Summer 1989. I was 8 years old. I only managed 2 movies that summer, one being Ghostbusters 2 (which blew my eager young mind at the time) and Last Crusade (which also blew my mind). I don't think I could have asked for two bigger blockbusters to choose from. Having been a rabid child fan of Raiders and Temple of Doom all things Indy were fresh in my mind and even as an 8-year-old I truly 'got' Last Crusade.Set 2 years after Raiders, and 3 years after Temple of Doom, Last Crusade opens with a flashback to Indy's youth and an aggravating cameo by River Phoenix in the role. His anachronistic hair, androgynous physiognomy, and that fact that he looks absolutely nothing like Harrison Ford take me out of the film every time, and spoils the long opening scene for me. The opening does nothing apart from establish all of Indy's trademarks (the hat, the whip, the scar, the fear of snakes), which he apparently all got within five minutes. Luckily the film soon jumps forward to 1938 and the opening quickly is forgotten about as shady antique collector Walter Donovan encourages Indy to go after the Holy Grail.With Der Fuhrer also after the sacred chalice Indy must once again face off against the despicable Nazis, rescue his bumbling father (Sean Connery, having the time of his life), and keep one step ahead of Donovan with Sallah and Brody tagging along.There is loads of inventive, exciting action in many exotic, breath-taking locations and all of it is immaculately photographed by Douglas Slocombe in lovely anamorphic Panavision. Even with today's many advancements in movie camera technology you'll rarely see a film as beautifully photographed as this. All very high-key, mind you, the polar opposite of the dark, subterranean Temple of Doom.Now, herein lies my only gripe with Last Crusade (other than River Phoenix) is the fact that it's just too light-hearted. Spielberg expressed regret over the fact that he made Temple of Doom very dark and mean-spirited (which I don't agree with as it is my personal favorite) so he compensated by making Last Crusade more cheerful and bright. It's not an annoying shift in tone, but it could have been balanced out with a bit more blood and gore.Last Crusade makes the perfect end to the real Indiana Jones trilogy. Spielberg really should have left it as our hero, his dad, and his two sidekicks rode off into the sunset. How can you top that? How can you come back from that? But 19 years later he tarnished many reputations and spoiled many memories with the deeply, DEEPLY misjudged Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.It was an amazing film to see as a child, and it's a shame that kids these days are not exposed to anything as good. If you can turn a blind eye to River Phoenix you will surely have a great time with Last Crusade. It's not the Snake Car on the train he ought to worry about, it's the Viper Room on Sunset Boulevard."
"In his third film, Indiana Jones continues to hunt down artifacts and fight bad guys. This flick easily has as much action as the last outings, with plenty of fights and chases to entertain. The setpieces are quite ambitious as Indy outruns villains on a moving train, infiltrates a castle, and takes on a tank on horseback, among other brilliant sequences. And the comedy is probably the best in this film; the dialogue and interplay between characters are often quite witty.The story for this is strong and ambitious as Indy goes out to find the holiest artifact of them all: the Holy Grail. The story is tightly-paced and well planned-out as mysteries unravel and turncoats are revealed as the adventure presses on. But what really propels this story to greatness are the characters; they receive their strongest treatment here as Indy struggles to reconcile things with his dad (not to mention, the opening flashback reveals a lot about their characters).The film is still competently made, with quality photography. Acting is great; Harrison Ford is still perfect as the main hero, Sean Connery is perfectly cast as Indy's father, Alison Doody is appealing, John Rhys-Davies is still the man, Julian Glover is decent as the villain, and River Phoenix was perfect in his role. Writing is good, production value is high, and the music is awesome.Recommended! 5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Perfect | Film: Perfect)"
"A+ The Indiana Jones original trilogy, before it became an anthology with its blundered fourth film, is one of the rare treats in cinema. Here you have a great setup, and it is followed thru for the vast majority of the sequels. In saying so I might as well mention that in my opinion the most perfect trilogies in all of movie history are the Toy Story films, the original Star Wars, and my beloved Evil Dead series. It's debatable whether one likes ""Return of the Jedi"", ""Temple of Doom"", or ""Army of Darkness"", but either way none of those films caused the respective series to crash and burn like ""Batman Forever"".""The Last Crusade"" is an epic success on so many levels it could very well be the best of all three. First off, you get to see Indiana Jones as a kid which was just an awesome sequence. Secondly, it's such an incredibly strong cast. Harrison ford and Sean Connery play off each other so well the father-son concept is both comedic yet emotional. I just never tire of their scenes together. Returning are both Denholm Elliott as Marcus Brody and John Rhys Davies as Sallah, contributing nicely. Alison Doody may be my favorite actress of the three. Karen Allen was pretty awesome, I never really cared for Kate Capshaw, but Doody has a sexy charm to her that appeals the most to me because she pulls of the role of the villainess so well. The joke of how promiscuous she is never gets old. Michael Byrne was pretty menacing, and I really liked the character played by Kevork Malikyan. After all the titular quote is uttered by him.The story is well written, just like the others paying homage to the 30s serial heroes. It's often sophisticated yet always fun, and the awe-inspiring action scenes are some of the best out of frankly all four. The score by John Williams is amazing, adding to the mystic quite nicely. ""The Last Crusade"" is arguably one of Steven Spielberg's and George Lucas' best works."
