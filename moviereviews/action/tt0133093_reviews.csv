"The story of a reluctant Christ-like protagonist set against a baroque, MTV backdrop, The Matrix is the definitive hybrid of technical wizardry and contextual excellence that should be the benchmark for all sci-fi films to come.Hollywood has had some problems combining form and matter in the sci-fi genre.  There have been a lot of visually stunning works but nobody cared about the hero. (Or nobody simply cared about anything.)  There a few, though, which aroused interest and intellect but nobody 'ooh'-ed or 'aah'-ed at the special effects.  With The Matrix, both elements are perfectly en sync.  Not only did we want to cheer on the heroes to victory, we wanted them to bludgeon the opposition.  Not only did we sit in awe as Neo evaded those bullets in limbo-rock fashion, we salivated.But what makes The Matrix several cuts above the rest of the films in its genre is that there are simply no loopholes.  The script, written by the Wachowski brothers is intelligent but carefully not geeky.  The kung-fu sequences were deftly shot -- something even Bruce Lee would've been proud of.  The photography was breathtaking.  (I bet if you had to cut every frame on the reel and had it developed and printed, every single frame would stand on its own.)  And the acting?  Maybe not the best Keanu Reeves but name me an actor who has box-office appeal but could portray the uneasy and vulnerable protagonist, Neo, to a T the way Reeves did.  But, come to think of it, if you pit any actor beside Laurence Fishburne, you're bound to confuse that actor for bad acting.  As Morpheus, Mr. Fishburne is simply wicked!  Shades of his mentor-role in Higher Learning, nobody exudes that aura of quiet intensity than Mr. Fishburne.  His character, battle-scarred but always composed Morpheus, is given an extra dose of mortality (He loves Neo to a fault.) only Mr. Fishburne can flesh out.People will say what they want to say about how good The Matrix is but the bottomline is this: finally there's a philosophical film that has cut through this generation.  My generation. The Wachowski brothers probably scribbled a little P.S. note when they finished the script saying: THINK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT YOUR EXISTENCE.  What is the Matrix, you ask?  Something that's closer to reality than you think.Either that or it's my personal choice for best film of all-time."
"** May contain spoilers **There aren't many movies I watched in the theatre twice  let alone on the same day - but immediately after the credits had rolled (and still pumped up by 'Rage against the Machine'), I queued up for the next screening of 'The Matrix'. I was so blown away by that film, I feared - and probably rightly so - that I hadn't caught every detail of what I'd just seen. I later found out that many of my friends had had a similar reaction to the film, and I know virtually no one who liked the film and didn't watch it at least twice. It's simply one of those rare films that are so rich you just have to watch them several times.In structure, style and concept, 'The Matrix' was ground-breaking; it marked the first time the visual style of Manga comic books and Anime such as 'Akira' or 'Ghost in the Shell' had been successfully translated to a live-action film. Apart from 'Blade Runner', which has a totally different mood and pace (but is also a masterpiece and visionary film-making), there simply hadn't been anything even remotely like it. The jaw-dropping action sequences have such a raw, gripping energy they feel like an adrenalin overdose, but unlike most action films, they never overshadow the story; on the contrary - they enhance it and make complete sense within that universe.As for the story itself, I think this is one of the most original, fascinating Sci-Fi tales you'll likely ever see on screen. Clearly inspired by Japanese Anime and Manga yet also by authors like Isaac Asimov or Philip K. Dick, the story about humanity's war against its own creation, machines of an artificial intelligence that have evolved to the point where they have become the dominant 'species' and vastly superior to their creators, could take place in the same world as 'Blade Runner' or 'The Terminator' - albeit several hundred years later. But there is also a mythical, even religious undercurrent to the story; the themes of a prophecy, a ""liberator"" or even a ""messiah"" make 'The Matrix' transcend the Science-Fiction genre and become even more unique.'The Matrix' was a watershed moment in filmmaking  in every respect  and even though two inferior sequels have left a bit of a stain on the film, they can't distract from what an uncompromising and hugely influential masterpiece this is. Sci-Fi movies that were released after 'The Matrix' have tried very hard to achieve a similar look and tone, but the original still owns them all. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
"Writing a review of The Matrix is a very hard thing for me to do because this film means a lot to me and therefore I want to do the film justice by writing a good review. To tell the truth the first time I saw the film I was enamored by the effects. I remember thinking to myself that this was one of the most visually stunning films I had ever seen in my life. Also having always been a comic book fan and a fan of films that were larger than life, the transitional element of the story was very appealing to me and this probably heightened my enjoyment of the film very much. It wasn't until some time later (and after having seen the film a few times more) that I started to think about the film. I recognized the Christian elements quite quickly but it wasn't until I wrote an actual 15-page essay on the film that I tapped into some of the philosophical and religious elements and that made me appreciate the film even more. I won't say that I have recognized all elements because the film is quite literally packed with them.Acting wise the film works excellently. I won't say that there aren't any issues because there are but overall the acting is pretty flawless. Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix (and the sequels). He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot and I certainly don't wan't to spoil it for anyone. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor (mostly in the sequels). Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.Effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you'll probably agree. The effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopian atmosphere not unlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly. The film looks beautiful at all times and today 6 years later (my God has it already been 6 years?) the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films. Add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands. Very well done.The reason that I think The Matrix is more reviewable than pretty much any other film is the story and the philosophical and religious elements of the story because with every viewing I catch something I didn't see the previous time I watched it. Without spoiling the film I think I can mention a few of the more obvious elements. Obviously the film draws on the Messiah myth as Neo is a clear reference to Jesus with the analogy of his name (Neo = one, as in The One) but also hidden in his other name, Thomas A. Anderson. The first part of his last name, Anderson comes from the Greek Andros meaning ""man"" and combine this with the second part of his last name ""son"" and add a little creativity you will come up with the combination ""son of man"" which was a title Jesus came up with about himself. Also the first time we meet Neo a man calls him (and I quote): ""You're my Saviour man. My own personal Jesus Christ."" It doesn't get any more obvious than that. Aside from the Christianic elements the film also gets its inspiration from Budhism, Gnosticism (Gnosis = knowledge) but is also inspired by Plato and his analogy of the Cave and Jean Baudrillard's essay, Simulacra and Simulations. Explaining these elements would make this review go on forever so aside from mentioning them I will not comment on them further.To all the people who doubt the profound nature of The Matrix I can only give one advice: Free your mind and watch the film again. You won't regret it. If I had to choose a favorite all time film my choice would probably fall on either The Matrix (obviously I don't expect people to agree but if they do thats great) or The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and I recommend it to all fans of sci-fi and people who like philosophy.10/10 - on my top 3 of best films."
"The Matrix...when I first heard about it, I expected just another sci-fi action thriller.  Good and filled with insane stunts, but not terribly intelligent.Boy, was I wrong.  Oh, the stunts are there in spades, all right, and yes, they are awesome.  And the special effects are absolutely amazing (even if similar ones have been used in other movies as a result- and not explained as well).But the movie has plot as well.  It has characters that I cared about.  From Keanu Reeves' excellent portrayal of Neo, the man trying to come to grips with his own identity, to Lawrence Fishburne's mysterious Morpheus, and even the creepy Agents, everyone does a stellar job of making their characters more than just the usual action ""hero that kicks butt"" and ""cannon fodder"" roles.  I cared about each and every one of the heroes, and hated the villains with a passion.  It has a plot, and it has a meaning...and lo and behold, a plot does help the fight scenes!  Just try it, if you haven't seen the movie before.  Watch one of the fight scenes.  Then watch the whole movie.  There's a big difference in the feeling and excitement of the scenes- sure, they're great as standalones, but the whole thing put together is an experience unlike just about everything else that's come to the theaters.  Think about it next time you're watching one of the more brainless action flicks...think how much better it COULD be.All I can say is WATCH THIS MOVIE.  If you haven't, you're missing out on one of the best films of all time.  It isn't just special effects, folks."
"Without a doubt one of the best and most influential movies of all time, the Matrix is the defining science fiction film of the 1990's and the biggest leap the genre has taken since Stanley Kubrick's 2001: a Space Odyssey and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. The Matrix is a ground-breaking motion picture that not only raised the bar for all the science-fiction films to come after it but also redefined the action genre with its thrilling action sequences and revolutionary visual effects.The film tells the story of Thomas Anderson a computer hacker that in the world of hacking goes by the alias of Neo. When he is contacted by the mysterious outlaw Morpheus and having always questioned his reality, he is awakened to the truth that the world he's been living in is a simulated reality called the Matrix and that he's nothing more than a slave in this dystopian world, created and controlled by A.I powered machines.The direction and script by the Wachowskis is fantastic, as they drew ideas and inspirations from every other great sci-fi and cyberpunk movie and anime before the film, combining it with stunning action and putting it into one picture that has enough style, substance and subtext that everyone ended up giving their own interpretation of the story. The research that went into the preparation of the screenplay is quite extensive but the manner in which it is presented on the big screen is also very impressive. Every character presented on the film, has a well-defined arc and a purpose, and their motivations are clear.The cinematography is impeccable. It was very innovative in the use of the camera angles and movements, the zooms, the slow motion captures and the different color palette used to differentiate the Matrix and the real World. The editing is flawless, as it makes sure that every scene is integral to the story and ensures the pace of the film stays ferocious through its entire runtime. Each frame is also packed with so much visual information for the viewer to devour. The visual effects introduced us to the bullet-time effect and their impact can still be felt in today's movies. The performances are also incredible. Each member of the cast gave their best performances and brought the characters they portray to life, but the one that stands out the most is Hugo Weaving's disciplined rendition of his character, Agent Smith; a powerful computer program made to search and destroy the human rebellion, in undoubtedly the greatest performance in his career.In conclusion The Matrix is a masterpiece everyone should see. It is one of the most thought provoking, inventive, pioneering, influential and stylish movies of all time and it's also full of philosophical and religious allegories waiting for interpretation. Immortal for its contribution to cinema and pop culture, its brilliant combination of inventive visual effects, excellent vision and exquisite action easily makes it one of the best, most influential and most entertaining movies ever made."
"The Wachowski brothers really did excel themselves with this movie. It's a brilliant movie on a number of different levels - the directing is excellent, the camera work is great, the visuals are stunning, the kung-fu is A+, acting is executed with style and conviction, and the plot is truly inspired. It's really hard to use enough superlatives on this movie!It'd be a 10/10, except for the ending. Having Neo do what he does at the end really lets it down, in my opinion. However, there's a couple of sequels on the way, so let's see what the Wachowskis can do to make up for it.Other than that, (and like I said above) the movie is operating on so many different levels that each time you watch it, you pick up something new... this isn't by accident, either. The Wachowski brothers had the actors read a number of definitive works (Simulation & Simulcra was one I believe) in modern literature and psychology, and applied liberal dashings of aspects of the major religions to provide the best sci-fi movie of the decade, if not ever.I'm yet to meet somebody who hasn't enjoyed it. It's my favourite movie to watch on a good cinema system, too."
"My review of the best epic Science Fiction Action film, The Matrix (1999) starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, Joe Pantoliano, Marcus Chong and Gloria Foster.This was be the first movie I went to see in the movie theater with my mom when I was 15.years old, when I read in the magazines about The Matrix I was blown away and I wanted to see it right away. The Matrix is the best action sci-fi films that Keanu Reeves made in the 90's. It is one of my personal favorite movies. The Matrix is a (1999) American science fiction action film written and directed by The Wachowskis, starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano. It depicts a dystopia future in which reality as perceived by most humans is actually a simulated reality called ""the Matrix"", created by sentient machines to subdue the human population, while their bodies' heat and electrical activity are used as an energy source. Computer programmer ""Neo"" learns this truth and is drawn into a rebellion against the machines, which involves other people who have been freed from the ""dream world"".Written and directed by the Wachowski brothers, this classic sci-fi action film stars Keanu Reeves as a lowly computer programmer who discovers his entire existence, and that of all mankind, is nothing but a simulation in a computer. The reality within a reality is a concept that's done before... but never like this - The Matrix requires absolute attention from his audience, least you'll be completely lost in a few minutes. With the help of supporting cast members Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne-Moss, Reeves discovers that inside this simulation environment known as The Matrix, he can control, bend, and manipulate space-time... resulting in some of the most incredibly iconic images to ever grace the silver screen. The slow-motion ""bullet-time"" effects as they're known today were groundbreaking and revolutionary when we first saw them 12 years ago. Although Reeves is notorious for his inability to really convey much emotional range, his character here lends itself well to him as an actor. This is a movie that makes you think, makes you gasp, and makes totally forget where the 136-minutes went after finishing it. It's no wonder this film spawned two very successful sequels, and dozens of copy-cats. The Matrix, ""Visually revolutionary, and mind-blowing."" Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix. He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. He also played the roles in Underrated Daredevil (2003)and Bad Boys I & II. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character.

10/10 for one of the best epic American science fiction action film's in the history movies like this and Aliens (1986) don't exist anymore. It is one of my personal favorite movies, it is the movie I saw with my mom in the movie theater it is memories on my mom who is no longer with us anymore and I miss he."
"It's been a while since a movie has generated enough interest in me for me to watch it.  ""The Matrix"" looked exciting enough in the trailers, so I decided to give it a look.  What I found was an amazing movie, with some of the greatest special effects I've ever seen.  The camera angles really work for the action sequences and the choreographed fight scenes made me yearn for more.  Say what you want about Keanu Reeves' acting.  He may not deliver the best dialogue, but his look can carry a film.  He was a great choice for the role of Neo.  Carrie Anne Moss was great as was the underrated Laurence Fishburne.  I highly recommend this film for those who are a fan of visually stunning movies.  It will blow away your senses..."
"The first time i watched this, i was absolutely amazed with the concept of it. The action is just so amazing to watch. I've seen this film 3 times and each time it just gets better. If you like sci fi action films then this is the film for you."
"I remember taking a class in social psychology many years ago. The Joy Luck Club figured prominently in the course. I like the idea of combining movies and theory.I am now studying metaphysics, and any study of reality begins with René Descartes, the father of modern philosophy. Descartes began his intellectual odyssey with this question: How do we know that there is a reality outside our own minds? We each know that we have experiences, and we can be sure of these experiences; therefore, each of us can be sure that we exist. But how do we know that the internal experiences we have corresponds to objects outside our minds?This is the whole theme of The Matrix. Watching this film is like studying metaphysics."
"The Wachowski Brothers vision of a possible future takes the visual and sound aspects of filmmaking to a new high. Incorporating older still photography with computer enhancement to the degree that appears on the screen has raised the genre to a level that will be very hard-pressed by filmmakers for a number of years. Acting was wonderful, script, visual, sound, everything about this film is a tribute to a usually overlooked genre."
"The Matrix is one of the best science fiction action film directed by The Wachowski Brothers. The film has influenced both the cinema industry and the computer entertainment industry. When you watch The Matrix for the first time, it looks like perfect action movie with high-class special effects and good actors.Time passed and we remember only a black cloak, two hands shooting, kung-fu and running on the walls.Recently I watched it again and I was amazed that there was so much hidden behind the spectacular scenes that I needed to watch this film several times, and I would probably find something that I had missed earlier. Reality is the only what we see and feel.We can understand the movie in different ways. You will see what you emphasize. Slavery, the fight against the system, the role of man in this system and the system in life, fanaticism and faith, chosenness and resurrection.I suggest watching The Matrix even if you've already watched it."
"By the end of the 90s, there hadn't been much in terms of fresh, new sci-fi that we hadn't seen before. Or so I thought.The Matrix combined the best of hard science-fiction with Asian cinema's frenetic and masterfully choreographed action sequences, gorgeous direction, pitch-perfect casting, and the best martial arts I'd ever seen in a Hollywood film.I don't think the sequels did it justice, but The Matrix - as a stand-alone film - remains one of my all time favorites in ANY genre."
"Even with the new 4k hdr these the graphics and action scenes area holding up to the test of time. It not only looks better than mainstream movies today, you're hard pressed to tell what was added in visual effects and what was happening at the time of the shoot.The entire tower scene, not just the bottom level, is a thing of beauty. From all of the rain and explosions and bits flying around that you can see clearly now in 4K, to the generated explosion when the bomb hits the basement. Just gorgeous. Give it a watch, or a rewatch. It's worth it even now more than ever."
"The Matrix is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made!I read it used to be one of Tarantino's favourite ones too, but the second and third ones ruined the whole beautiful idea and brought the overall value of the movie pretty low.The story/philosophy is mind-blowing and the directing, special effects and the overall performance absolutely amazing. Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is an IT specialist in his day-to-day job and a hacker (alias Neo) during the night. He is looking for Morpheous (Lawrence Fishburn) who could give him the answer to the question 'What is the Matrix?' The more relevant questions to ask, though, would be ""How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?"" and ""How would you know if what is happening right now is not a virtual reality?""The antagonist, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), is one of my favourite characters. Just watch his mouth - the way he speaks, the tone and pitch of his voice, his pronunciation, even the pauses he makes while speaking, have an incredible effect on the viewer. The concept of people being like cancer to this world is absolutely astounding.Carrie Ann Moss was the perfect choice for Trinity because any other blond, big lipped, big brested 'bimbo' would have totally ruined her character.A few more questions pop up in one's mind. ""Haven't we gone too far creating such super intelligent machines?"", ""What if they become so powerfull one day and take control over humanity?""The acting's just amazing, all of them, no exceptions. The 4 leading characters though... (Morphy, Trinity, Neo & Agent Smith) - (yes, to me there are 4 leads) - I love them all. I can't imagine the movie with any other 4 actors but L. Fishbourn, C.A. Moss, Keanu and H. Weaving. They were born to play those roles.Whoever did the casting did a terrific job. Bravo!Brilliant, absolutely brilliant!"
"At first, I wasn't interested in seeing the Matrix. But after hardly hearing any bad reviews for it (and believe me, I hear bad reviews for every movie I enjoy) I decided to give it a try. At first, although I really loved the fights, graphics and characters, the plot confused me. (Anyone confused by the plot at all should go to www.knowthematrix.com and you'll find out everything you could want to know) By the second time I watched it, I really understood it, which made the movie even more enjoyable.I really loved this movie. Just about every character, good or bad, is very interesting and cool. The acting was excellent. Even though I think this was Keanu Reeves at his best, the best acting jobs were done by Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) and Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity). Hugo Weaving did an excellent job as Agent Smith and Joe Pantoliano was great as Cypher as well.The plot is one of the best movie plots I've seen in a movie. An accountant by day, computer hacker by night guy suddenly finds out that reality as we know it is fake and that we are actually in a giant computer program run by robots (that we created, of course) in order for them to get power. Not only that, but he finds out that he is one who is, according to prophecy, going to put an end to it. The greatest thing is that you learn things just as Neo does, so you can really relate to his character.My favorite thing about this movie is that no matter how many times you watch it, you will learn more about it. I guarantee this. Some may not like this movie because the plot is too complicated, but I recommend that anyone who enjoys movies should go buy this one right away."
"Reality is non-dual, which means that all boundaries, all categories, and all distinctions ultimately collapse, they're all relative. There is no distinction between inside/outside, me/other, right/wrong, black/white, human/non-human, all of these dualities will ultimately collapse.
Your mind constructs all these categories and distinctions. It is beneficial to see how most of the things taught in school, and adult life has just been categories that were constructed by the human mind. Many of these distinctions are purely conceptual, they're not absolute in any sense and that they ultimately all collapse into one unity."

"20 years after its release, and several years since I last saw it, some reflections on the experience of rewatching The Matrix. In no particular order ...1) It still look great. I mean, this is one amazing, stylish looking phone. Very little about the look of the film has dated - the mobile phones, obviously, Neo's computer, and very briefly a couple of visual effects creak. But otherwise, this looks as amazing at it did on release. It's sumptuous.2) I think I was one of the many who misjudged Keanu Reeves all those yeas ago. I made easy jokes about his vacant stare and apparent intelligent. From this vantage point we can see he's been in a good number of successful, intelligent films. It's also become clear that within the industry he as a reputation as decent, hardworking man who is a pleasure to work with.3) It's apparent again how literate and cine-literate the film is. I knew this 20 years ago, but since then I've seen a lot more films and read a lot more books, and this time around I especially loved the way the film nods its head to other film genres and influences. I noticed a lot of Peckinpah, and did I see a nod to Kurosawa there too? And I was reminded that for an English Literature graduate like me, this is a goldmine of quotes, allusions and references.4) Seen 20 years on, its influence on cinema since is clear. There's a lot we could talk about here, but I was especially struck by how indebted a director like Christopher Nolan is (keeper of the flame of intelligent blockbusters), especially with Inception.5) I'd forgotten that the narrative ostensibly maintains uncertainty about Neo's identity until just before the end. I'm not sure this really works - anyone who's read many books or ever done an anagram will not find that the most suspenseful part of the narrative.6) Despite a run time of 2 and a quarter hours, it never flags and attention never wonders. The film fizzes with kinetic energy and the time flies by. It's a lean film, without a wasted moment.7) The film is, of course, packed with religious allusions. When I wrote a chapter on this for my BA Theology dissertation, I said I thought the film was neo-Bhuddist (forgive the pun, please), and I stand by that on rewatching. Of course, there's lots of allusions to Christian and other theology, and The Matrix spawned some really bad reading of film by Christians which has never really stopped. When will some Christians learn to read a film/book etc with integrity and understanding of what the film is trying to do? It's a spiritually confused mish-mash of a film - but still a gloriously entertaining one.8) All these years later, it turns out The Matrix was somewhat prophetic about the role technology would play in our lives. Humans permanently plugged in to networks? Different layers of reality that are somehow more real than what we think of as real? The Wachowskis saw all that and more coming 20 years ago. Artists are the weather vane of society; we really should learn to pay attention to them.9) Bottom line. I still bloody love this film. I'm trying to work out if I have the requisite strength to revisit the sequels...."
"When we will see another movie with the same speed? So deeply philosophical? Sadly, the most likely answer is... NEVER"
"Who is to say what is real or not? We are defined by our view of reality, no matter how twisted or demented it is in comparison to 'normal' people. *evil eye* Yes, I see you all, looking in the mirror, trying to decipher whether or not your view is the reality we all share.The Matrix not only supplies the world with a whole new level of special effects mixed with style and substance, it also brings a whole new meaning to the word 'paranoria'. This is one of those great epics that becomes a milestone in our present day world, a mark for which just about everybody can appreciate. Not since the original Starwars trilogy has a science fiction film reached across almost the entire population and gripped it with awesome special effects, great sound, and a overall feel of ground breaking movie making magic. It also serves up a good dose of paranoid delusions we all need in our lives every now and then.With that, I leave you with the fact that I've seen more different types of people liking this one film than most other films to date. Move over George Lucas, you may have just met your match... :)"
"In the year 1999, ""The Matrix"" and ""Fight Club"" were undoubtedly the best films of the year. The Matrix was truly revolutionary in special effects, specifically in CGI (Computer-Generated-Imaging) technology. The still cameras that were used to capture multiple angles of a single shot, in bullet-time technology, was a creative new approach. The film is initially suspenseful with people not knowing quite what was happening until Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne) reveals that Neo's (Keanu Reeves) reality was actually a fabricated world that is an elaborate simulation created by machines. Neo and the majority of the world's inhabitants have been stuck in simply a mental simulation prison. The magnitude of philosophy in sync with special effects make ""The Matrix"" a one-of-a-kind movie masterpiece. College classes show this movie in their philosophy class, and at the same time can prove to be one of the best special effects movies ever. Supplementally, ""The Matrix"" also provides endless action and a pretty solid storyline that influences the philosophical ideas in the movie. There are so many great things in this movie, it is just crazy.The color palette along with the time and effort put into stunts also accelerates this movie on all filming levels. ""The Matrix"" leaves the viewer a sense of pride in the world he/she can live in to just know that people are capable of creating at this level. Unfortunately, monetary and timing motives offset the potential quality of the sequels. ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and ""The Matrix Revolutions"" were just a waste of time and weren't carefully thought out, as was the first Matrix. 10/10"
"This movie raises one of my favorite questions. What is reality? The biggest strength of The Matrix is the story. The special effects hold up because they did not try to go beyond their technological limits.The biggest weakness of The Matrix is some of the dialogue. It is often times either melodramatic or robotic. It has a few plot holes, the biggest of which being blood. ""If it happens in the matrix your mind makes it real..."" I don't know how your mind could give you a bloody lip.With all that The Matrix is still the best sci-fi/action flick ever made."
"It is funny how it has been 15 years since ""The Matrix Revolutions"", bringing the movie trilogy to a close. I wrote reviews for it and ""Reloaded"" as well back in 2003 and I realized that I had never written a few lines for the first movie. Well, here I am.I will keep it short. We all know how good ""The Matrix"" is. The plot, the visuals, the mythos, it all adds up to a movie experience that is timeless. Almost 20 years later, it now has a ""retro"" vibe that makes it more interesting, with late 90s cars, rotary phones, Nokia cells and CRT monitors.Today sets the 4K HDR release of the trilogy. Coming back to ""The Matrix"" after probably 10 years since my last viewing, it is a constant reminder of how the Wachowski's masterpiece shaped up the movie industry and its echos are still felt today.A true timeless piece of movie history."
"Still in 2019 a lot of people will this this movie as science fiction, I could watch it over and over and still discover need things and details that can relate to real life event.
The characters did an amazing job."
"If you are looking for the answer to this question then you are going to find it in the 1999 masterpiece from The Wachowski brothers which watching in 2019 still feels like it could have comed out last week and you wouldn't really notice it's a 20 year old movie. Everything still holds up and doesn't feel that it has aged too much both visualy and story wise.
I watched this movie last time in 2012 and remembered quite a lot of the story watching it again in 2019 but this time I paid more attention to everything.I want to talk about few aspects of the movie very brieflyThe story. ( Easy to watch, engaging, action packed about a regular guy whose life changes quite drasticly and the growth of becoming the one he never thought he could.
Sound design. (Excellent. When I watched all the fight,action scenes the special effects gave a satisfying feedback in my ears when someone landed a punch or got knocked out.)
Cinematography (Feels like they thought about everything and it has that special Matrix feel to everything.)
Characters (Most mémorable are Neo which needs no introduction and agent Smith which has a way to intimidate even the viewer and they both are just iconic legends.)Probably my favourite scenes were the lobby,the rooftop and all the fighting scenes against agent Smith where an underdog just tries anyway even knowing his chances of winning are slim.To conclude I would say people in the year 2070 could watch this and it would still hold up. Would I reccomend it? Yes. Will I watch it again ? It's great but I will most likely watch it again in few years after somehow my life leads back to Neo."
Watched again recently and still stands up as one of the best movies ever!
"There will be no movie like matrix, thanks for the masterpiece !!"
The Matrix is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made!
"You walk into this film not knowing what the Matrix is. You take your seat and watch the trailers. The green Warner Brothers (green? you ask) trademark comes up, and without warning you are thrust into the Wachowski brothers grand vision. 2 hours of excitement later, you stumble out of the cinema, knowing what the Matrix is.This is one great movie. Keanu Reeves is cooler than cool as Neo. The Wachowski brothers skilful direction is brilliant. The special effects sequences will blow you away, did I mention the government lobby scene?The film starts off with a 'what is real?' first half, and then the first kung-fu sequence makes way for an action- packed, John Woo-esque second half with slomo and style cranked up all the way to the top. Did I mention the government lobby scene?Keanu becomes Cool Keanu, Carrie-Anne Moss is a real find and Hugo Weaving is perfect in his against typecasting role as the evil Agent Smith.You may notice in this review that I have not revealed what the Matrix is. Like the trailer says, 'You have to see it for yourself.'Excellent. Best film of '99. 9/10."
"Right there with Seven and Silence of the Lambs for me.  I love this film, and rate it a notch above some of the other great action films of our time (i.e., Terminator, Predator) because it has a really well thought out (although moderately unbelievable) story line.  A lot of thought provoking material, and some interesting subtleties. I've seen it 10 times (I don't usually watch a movie more than once), and I'll watch it a few more. Enjoy!"
"A large part of the appeal of 'The Matrix' for me was the special effects and action-packed scenes. But, on reflection, part of the appeal is also its philosophical and religious underpinnings...When asked whether Buddhist ideas influenced them, the Wachowski brothers offered an unqualified ""Yes!"" and at a very basic level, the movie portrays two levels of reality: our everyday existence and a deeper, more significant, underlying reality (the matrix). This is very much like the Two Truths in Buddhism: relative truth, in which everything is perception, and ultimate truth which is the way things really are (objective reality). Because of our ignorance, we mistake the everyday world for something real and objective, and this is the cause of our suffering. As in 'The Matrix', breaking through relative truth to direct contact with ultimate truth represents a high spiritual attainment, some would say enlightenment, an awakening. (Remember the message on Neo's computer screen: ""Wake up, Neo!"")Mahayana Buddhism suggests that there are great spiritual warriors (like Neo?) who are walking the path from ignorance to enlightenment, and who can in turn guide us on the path."
Matrix till this day is one of my most watched movies of all time.
"(Correction of a reference I made in my review of April 12,1999)1. The feel of ""The Matrix"": This is a movie that envelops you, and is reminiscent of two works: a movie and an excerpt from a novel. The first is the 1-hour made-for-TV-film ""The Lathe of Heaven,"" by Ursula K. Le Guin which was broadcast on Channel 13 / Educational TV back in 1980: after the film, I felt I was a character living in the film. ""The Lathe of Heaven"" was about a character whose dreams become reality; every time he wakes up, he is in a new future / futuristic setting where everything changes in accordance to his dream.Kurt Vonnegut (in ""Breakfast of Champions"") had a small sci-fi concept in one of his books called (approximately) ""A message from the creator."" In this story, God writes a book to the only person in the world. God tells him that the entire world was created for him, all religions were invented so he could have a choice of religions, and other people were merely robots who had a specific purpose, such as fighting with him. Thus, whatever he does doesn't matter, since no one else is real but him. The character reads this book, and goes insane, thinking that it is true.Similarly, when you leave ""The Matrix,"" you wonder what is real and what is a simulation. After the movie, my friend walked across the street blindly ignoring cars, perhaps trapped in the illusion that this was not real. It took several minutes for him to escape this fantasy world. It affected me similarly.2. Personal Reactions: a) Movie was great (tentatively on my list of ""top 12 movies"" for me). b)I did not like Fishburne's pockmarked face and grimaces. c)Some corniness in the awakening kiss given to Keanu/Neo, that in my mind, could be traced to reality: people in comas do hear and can respond after what appears to be death.3. Plot Holes: How did the Operator recover from being killed/shot? How did the Oracle know what would happen?4. Political Correctness: a) Two to four black heroes who could easily have been white; b) a possible lesbian; c)a Latino; d)a short person; e)bad white guys(and no bad ethnic types); f) a middle-aged kindly motherly type, g)even a few kids as potential heroes, with one being a guru."
"I find it strange that most of the people who watched Matrix were only attracted by the visual effects and overlooked the scientific facts on which this movie was based.People enjoyed the flying mostly and hence liked Matrix 1 more than they did with 2 and 3 although the answer was in part 3 that is who will win the war eventually between humans and machines. Some people they make fun of the idea that one day humans will be in direct war with machines but those people have not read yet about the Nano technology. The latter technology offers something like the software which teaches Neo how to fight in little time. Well through Nano, they will be able to plant a brainlike chip which works 10,000 times faster than our brain and they are now trying to optimize the speed limit in a way that doesn't endanger our brain which might be burnt working under such speed.As for the flying part, it is very possible if the science of Psychokinesis is given more consideration and in the near future I reckon they will with the evolution of human body which is going toward less and less movement. Has anyone seen the prototype of the new cars which have no pedals and we use sticks to drive and direct the car in different directions.Well, I guess the movie has tackled all these scientific aspects alongside psychological and philosophical ones in a very brilliant way and I 100% give this move 20 on a scale out of 10!"
"Ok, I'm getting sick of comments saying stuff like ""The Matrix is the greatest film EVER MADE!""That's complete and utter bullturd. Yes, it had great cinematography and effects, yes it had a great soundtrack but NO WAY was the acting superb and NO WAY was the storyline great.Take that storyline and stick it in any other action movie and you would leave feeling disappointed at the end. It's major selling point was ""What is the Matrix? You have to see it for yourself."" Come on, the only plot twist was that thing to do with Cypher, and that wasn't greatly unforeseeable, there's things like that in every frigging action movie.The thing that set it apart was the ground-breaking camera effects, gnarly special effects and a funky soundtrack, as well as the costume design bit, with all that leather and expensive sunglasses. Without this stuff, all you would be left with is your average action movie.I'm not saying it was a bad film at all, just not one of the greatest. Highly entertaining, great to watch with your mates, definitely one of the most interesting films in recent years. But give me The Third Man, Memento or the Usual Suspects any day.7/10"
If they can recapture 1% of the magic in this film it will be a return to form
"I saw this movie at the theater in 1999. Awesome movie I'm almost every way. I recently watched it with my 10 year old daughter and she absolutely LOVED it as she is into sci fi. I cannot figure out however why it's rated R!! I feel like it should be PG-13. What's with the R rating? It's not like it had major language or violence and gore.. it had no sex or nudity either. Just unsure why was rated R but whatever, still a great movie. Can't say I remember 2 and 3 that we'll though"
"This movie really stands the test of time. I watched it as a kid and it was like nothing i had ever seen. Now, 20 years later and at least 10 years since i saw it last time, it still holds up perfectly. The story, the visuals, the tone. I might be biased but if you never saw it, please give it a try."
"An excellent movie with tons of special effects, fight scenes. A really good film with an interesting story."
"One of the icons at this era, it changes the way I saw life and movies."
It was a very good film and I very much enjoyed watching it.
"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerThe Wachowski Brothers sci-fi classic is a true classic. The story is complex, original, intriguing, and extremely detailed. The characters are all unique and they are all very interesting. The story is full of philosophical questions that make you think and the film is so complex it needs to be watched multiple times.The acting is very good. Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, Gloria Foster, Joe Pantoliano, Marcus Chong, and many others perform perfectly. Keanu Reeves is a very dry actor. He is very dry in this film but he plays his part well.The pacing is perfect and the runtime is perfect.The special effects are good even today. Pros: Complex, original, and extremely detailed story, great philosophical questions asked, unique characters, amazing acting, perfect pacing, a good runtime, and amazing special effectsCons: Keanu Reeves is very dry throughout the filmOverall Rating: 9.8"
After watching this movie i had serious doubts about my sense of reality. A must watch movie. Keenu does a great job with the character of Neo.
"*Deeply exhales* The movie MATRIX was indeed a breaking point for movie makers, and it paved way for both marketers, producers, and film makers generally. The era at the time the MATRIX was released really needed something new and different, and this was what the MATRIX was able to deliver. With ground breaking still motions and effects, it was indeed a movie of the time. While being perfectly casted with Keanu Reeves playing NEO, and Carrie-Anne Moss playing Trinity, while leaving the boss himself in the middle of it all, Laurence Fishburne playing Morpheus. Their roles were imbibed in them as if it were their true nature and this really made a significant difference between the so called science and fiction."
"Overwhelming and spectacular first part from a trilogy with some of the best action scenes ever made . This excitingly original film is full of thrills , cutting-edge visuals, stylist innovations , fights , tension , suspense and groundbreaking races , but also several commercial elements , including computer-simulated violence . This is a dynamic, fast-paced and amusing movie , though overlong . It's an enjoyable , if somewhat light-headed piece of escapism with state-of-art special effects and straightforward screenplay . Big-budgeted film by the great producer Joel Silver led to break into the booming Sci-Fi/adventure/fantasy market plenty of inventiveness and imagination . Full of action, it's complemented by rousing scenes , breathtaking fights and struggles are spotlights . It deals with Neo (Keanu Reeves) ¨who is thought to be the chosen one¨ a computer hacker learns from mysterious rebels about the true nature of his reality and his role in the war against its controllers . One night, a mysterious woman named Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss)seeks him out and introduces him to that faceless character he has been waiting for : Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) who carries him to Oracle (Gloria Foster) . Then Neo is advised by the Oracle about his future . As Neo learns about Matrix , he aware all life on Earth may be nothing more than an elaborate masquerade created by a malevolent cyber-intelligence and he results to be the chosen one . The rebel leaders led by Morpheus estimate that they have little time until 250,000 probes discover Zion and destroy it and its inhabitants. During this, Neo has to decide how he can save Trinity , Morpheus and partners from a dark fate and taking on Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) and his hoodlums . Meanwhile , a traitor betrays the group and the events get worse . It is a dark time for the world in this first adventure as the epic war between man and machine reaches a thundering crescendo : The group desperately battle to hold back the marauding Sentinel invasion from overtaking them . Neo, Morpheus and Trinity race against time to get their purports . While the human city of Zion is preparing for the oncoming war with the machines with very little chances of survival.This is an action-packed , booming following with some of the best action scenes ever filmed , plenty of bounds and leaps over buildings , including awesome visual effects by John Gaeta . This thrilling movie contains impressive fights , chills , breathtaking designs , dense philosophy and many other things . From the beginning to the end the comic-book action-packed and extreme violence is continued and it's fast movement ; for that reason the picture is pretty amusing ; furthermore contains lots of spectacular combats in mart arts style staged by Yue Woo Ping who also made ¨Kill Bill¨ and ¨Crouching tiger, hidden dragon¨ . Contrived beyond belief with spectacular struggles that play like video games , but slickly calculated to please 2000s audiences . Moving and pulsing musical score by Don Davis . Magnificent , glamorous production design by Owen Paterson . Colorful and imaginative cinematography by Bill Pope . The motion picture is stunningly written , produced and directed by Larry and Andy Wachowski-The Wachowski Brothers . It' s followed by ¨Matrix Reload¨ and ¨Matrix revolutions¨ with similar artistic team and cast adding Anthony Zerbe , Harry Lennix, Gina Torres , Harold Perrineau, Jada Pinkett Smith, Nora Gaye , among others in which the the city of Zion , the last outpost of humanity , is defended by valiant warriors against the massive invasion of the machines to save the humanity as Neo , Morpheus and Trinity fight to end the war at another front while also opposing the invasion on the hidden underground refuge ."
"I think there were Action/Sci-Fi movies before The Matrix and there are action/sci-fi movies after The Matrix. It changed everything. This movie was one of it's kind when it came and there was nothing like this seen before. Awesome action sequences, bullet times, slow motions and the concept, everything was awesome.Not just action, the movie is great in other aspects too. The movie is thought provoking and very influential. This movie forced every filmmaker of action/sci-fi movies to step up.I still remember when i watched this movie for the very first time more than 10 years ago, it felt like i'm in a different world. I've never ever seen anything like this. Movie had awesome effects, that might seems outdated these days, but that time it was first time something like that was shown in movies.This movie was really a gamechanger, and we are lucky that this movie actually happened."
"What is real? How do you define real? This question has been explored for its significance in metaphysics in other movies as well. The Thirteenth Floor is one of them and the other is Dark City. I mention these because they were released more or less around the same time as this movie was released. But these two movies do not enjoy the position and the popularity of this movie - The Matrix, why? Look at the box office success of the Matrix. Look at the popularity of this movie. Advertisements have been created based on the themes of this movie. Most people seem to have heard of the movie if not seen it. The Matrix enjoys a prominent position in the top 50 on the IMDb. Even a list of 100 best movies of all times as compiled by a documentary on the Discovery Channel mentioned this movie as among the top 100. The key to the enormous success of the Matrix is the symbiotic combination of two opposing elements. The first one being metaphysics or philosophy and the second element being intense amount of action. The Dark City is limited in its action and stresses more on the metaphysics aspect and so does the Thirteenth floor. When you see The Matrix, you see that there is far more metaphysics and philosophy in this movie when compared to the other two. And when you see the action sequences of the movie, the two movies fade into oblivion. There is so much for the intellectual to busy himself with in this movie. There is a reference to so many mythological places and figures. The character Neo is an anagram of One signifying the One Absolute many cultures believe in and then there is Trinity, an obvious reference to the Holy Trinity. The names of the ships, the numbers on the door, the name of the book Neo takes his CD out from all have a significance, a clue, if that is what one wants to call it. This movie gives enough to the intellectual to study and talk about. And yet the movie does not fail to capture the attention of the average movie goer. The average movie goer does not want to search for hidden symbols, he does not want to discuss the movie for hours and hours. He wants some action and some fun. The movie gives that as well. The movie has a lot of guns, a lot of chases and a lot of fighting. The average movie goer can appreciate the main aspect of this movie without bothering about all the hidden symbols which the intellectual chooses to see in the movie. Yet, he apparently does not deny himself the spirit of the movie and enjoys it. And I believe this is what has made the movie successful - the reconciliation between action and thrill and metaphysics and philosophy. This movie deserves all the praise and success that it has got. My personal all-time favorite. I never get tired of talking about it till date and love to see it with my friends if I get the chance."
"'Frank? Larry here. How are you? Listen, Andy and I are writing a new screenplay and we really want to sell this one. I'm thinking of writing a sci-fi pieceThat's why I'm CALLING you, I was an English major and everyone I know but you is an English major. My mother was a nurse, that's the closest I've ever come to science. You're the only person we know with any scientific education at allWell, we figure to sell, it has to have computers, and it has to have VIOLENCE. We're thinking about an eco-techno-cyberpunk-nuclear winter kind of thing with sequel possibilitiesWell, something like Terminator meets 2001 meets WarGames with some Johnny Mnemonic and Blade Runner thrown inIt's, say, about 200 years from now, and the world has been laid waste and taken over by advanced computers. WHY did they take over the world? Who cares? Because they're bad! What? 'Colossus: The Forbin Project?' Never heard of it. Look, it's just an evil computer, okay? I know computers have no feelings, but it makes a good storybecause it does, that's all. So I have a question: If you had a worldwide computer network, how would you power it?Huge farms of solar cells---talk about boringwhat else?nuclear power plantswhat else?Look, what about electricity from living things? I've been reading about lightning bugs, you know, how they make that light with their bodies? Well, here's what I've been thinking. The human body is the most efficient source of energy on the planet, right?It isn't? It's an energy CONSUMER? Only about 12 percent efficiency? Well, what about the human brain? It produces electricity, right? Electrochemical? Is that different? And it's the most efficient electricity producer on the planet, right?No? About the same as a 22-watt bulb? That's not very bright. What's that? Neither is my idea? Come on, work with me here! Okay, so what would be an EFFICIENT way to produce power for a worldwide computer network?Vast facilities containing huge tanks filled with methane-producing bacteria that drive gas turbinesThat may be EFFICIENT, but it's not EXCITING, Frank. You can't make a MOVIE about that. How about vast facilities containing HUMAN BEINGS who are all plugged into the Matrixthat's our working title, The Matrix. So they're all plugged into the Matrix because the computers of the Matrix are using them as a power source in their quest for control of the worldAGAIN with the nitpicking about why? See, we're thinking that the humans are kept in these vast hives of cells of, like, amniotic fluid, hooked up to tubes that feed them and wires that connect them to the MatrixThey're fed a nutritious liquid. I don't know where it comes from, or who produces it! I don't care and neither will the audience! So the people spend their entire lives floating in these little podsNo, they don't exercise, they just floatAtrophy? Osteoporosis? How do they have babies? I don't know, special mating pods! You don't have to be awake to produce semen; every teenage boy knows that. How are they plugged into the Matrix? Wires, of course, you know, implantsI don't know who implants them---robots! It does seem pretty far-fetched, but if I didn't think of those things, neither will an audienceWell, you see, they're all living in this imaginary virtual world that the Matrix computers have designed to look just like real life in the real worldbecause the computers have found that the people produce more electricity that way than if they're just asleep. Why? To sell the screenplay, that's why! So I figure, if their MINDS think they're exercising, their BODIES will think so, too. You know, it's like if you dream you die, you really will diepseudoscientific claptrap? No, what it is, is SHOWBIZ, Frank. But there is a small population of humans who have disconnected themselves from the Matrix and are alive and aware of the real world. They live in a secret city called Zion and are trying to overthrow the Matrix. How did they get disconnected? What do they eat if the world has been laid waste? Who cares? So they're looking for The One, who is the human who will have the power to control the Matrix instead of the other way around, and they find him, a guy named Neo. They manage to unplug him from the Matrix, and he awakens to the real world. It's really cool; we're going to put in all sorts of metaphysical Zen stuff about reality versus illusion and fate and stuff. Where did we learn about Zen? From our massage therapistNeo joins them in their fight. How do they fight? No, they don't blow up the main computer, that's the neat part: They fight the Matrix in the VIRTUAL world. You see, they can plug back in to the Matrix and so enter and leave the virtual world at will. So they fight enemy COMPUTER PROGRAMS, not the physical computer. How? Get this: Lots of way-cool balletic kung-fu stuff like Jackie Chan and lots of balletic gunfights like Chow Yun-Fat, only computer-enhancedLots of mayhem from beginning to end. Why? Because it SELLS TICKETS, that's why!The evil computers are looking for the rebels with machines in the real world, too, and Neo manages to block the computers from destroying the rebels in reality by fighting them in the virtual worldBecause that's the way to plan for sequels, that's whyWell thanks, Frank, you've been really helpful. If we sell the screenplay and it gets produced, we'll get you some free passes. Then you can see all your great ideas on the screen.'"
"The Matrix is a stunning, fast paced movie with lots of great special effects, high action, and a great soundtrack.But...is that all it is?No.  It isn't.When I listen to people talk about this movie, or read reviews by people who don't like it, the main problem they seem to have is the the plot, which they claim is mind-numbing, inaccessible, or just plain dumb.  They claim that the reason the movie is so popular is because if the special effects.Those who make these claims are just a little clueless, and the true art of storytelling is lost on them.Here's why.  Every story that we see on screen, read in a book or on the web has been told before in one fashion or another.  ""Jurassic Park"" is nothing more than a retelling of ""Frankenstein"" when you get right down to it. What catches our attention is when the story is re-told in such a different light that we like the retelling without really being called back to an earlier version.  The ""Jurassic Park example can work again for this point.  No one sees it as another retelling of ""Frankenstein"" at all, or at least, they don't dwell on the issue.  Shakespeare didn't create any stories....he borrowed from other texts, used other sources, and used words to his advantage.  The whole thing involves what is called ""intertextuality"", a term that I won't go into here, but is what I am trying to explain in the brief example of ""Jurassic Park.""Okay, stop yawning.Now, the Matrix has done the same thing, and what is funny is that very, very few people have recognized the major source of the story ( I wonder if the writers really know ).  I have heard that it is supposed to be Christian themed, and while there is some imagery in that respect, like a character named Trinity, Neo's death and rebirth at the end of the movie, the ship's name, etc. etc. etc., the list can go on.  But it has nothing to do with the story, which borrows very heavily from a philosophy written by Plato, of all people, back when the years were still labeled as BC.Plato wrote a philosophy, the actual name escapes me, but I keep hearing it referred to as ""The Cave.""  In this philosophy on the workings of a society, Plato stated that if you were to take four people from the day they were born, tie them to chairs so that their heads cannot move, and place them in the back of a cave where they cannot see the opening, nor have any daylight. They only have contact with each other.  Now, on the wall that they are facing, they can see shadows moving, be it a shadow puppet play, or whatever you can imagine, but all they see are those shadows.  You leave them in this cave for 20 years.  The only life that they know is the chair, and the playing of shadows on the wall.  They will not know the shadows are merely shadows, nor will they know the idea of freedom, and they will now know anything of the real world.  Then, you release one man, let him wander the world for awhile.  He sees that the world isn't just shadows on a wall, etc etc.  If you put him back in the cave, he will not view the shadows the same way that he once did.  He will also try to enlighten the other three that the images on the wall are only shadows, and that there is a beautiful and colorful world outside their cave.  But they will not believe him, and will even begin to see him as a blasphemer, and an enemy.WHEW!!That's the basic story in the Matrix.  Neo has been removed from the cave, and has seen the real world, and now knows he has been seeing shadows his entire life, and his mission is to make humanity realize that they are seeing shadows as well, but until that time, he will be regarded as an enemy by those still inside the cave.  The agents are the keepers of the cave, and the Matrix itself is the shadows that we see.  When you see this connection, the story can make more sense to those who can't quite understand it.And so by blending old, old stories with modern filming techniques and great acting by all involved and fast paced action, there is something to be said about this movie being a work of art, because it truly is."
