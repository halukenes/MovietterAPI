"I'll be honest, when I went into to cinema to watch this movie I was expecting to not like it. I had seen a little bit of the trailer and it did not really ""speak"" to me and Alita's eyes were off putting. When the movie had begun I was actually searching for things to dislike but surprisingly there were none apart from a few cringeworthy moments. I quickly got used to Alita's eyes and they became in fact likeable. The story began to draw me in and I got completely absorbed into the story and the visuals.The world is extraordinary and beautiful and the action scenes in this movie are fantastic, quite honestly some of the best I have seen. The story is a bit fast paced but not to a degree that it feels rushed. Alita as a character is great, she is kind-hearted, innocent, naive and protective. Throughout the movie Alita grows as a person and learns about sacrifice, loss, love and the horrors of the human mind. Alita is very likeable because she is such a good person in such a horrible world and you can't help feeling very sympathetic for an innocent being like her as she is exposed to the cruel world of Iron City.I watched this movie without knowing the source material and I loved it. I was drawn in very early on and had to watch it a second time. I can definitely recommend this movie to anyone."
"I really love this movie. The storyline is really great. Exciting from start to finish. The graphics are really cool. Its like I didn't wanna blink at all.
The plot is not mind-numbing as critics say. Well it seems like I have to stop listening to them. Because this film is worth watching by everyone.
Thank you for all people behind this movie. I'm sure this movie wasn't easy to make.
Now I really hope I don't have to wait too long for the sequel..."
"Alita Battle Angel is what happens when Hollywood finally get an Anime film right, ive gotta say James Cameron and Robert Rodriguez should work more together because this film is incredible.This film had heart and soul poured into its story and you could tell that 1000 of hours of work have gone into making this film. They've pulled one of the best films this year with incredible visual effects and CGI work that give this film a beautiful setting and background.The visual effect of Alita (voiced by Rosa Salazar) we're incredibly done giving detail in her eyes which made her character on screen look more like an actual human actress. Her character and acting is what made this film, they give her a human soul and a purpose with the writing which is so well done, it gives the audience an emotional journey of a young woman trying to discover who she is.The love interest side of the film is so done right it doesn't feel forced as well which along with its action sequences as well as it supporting cast was nothing short of perfect. The story does a great job of not revealing too much to earlier as slowly building up characters so you understand the story and draws you into every moment, this is matched by the awesome fight scenes and great formidable villains of the film adding to incredible film.This is one of those films that deserves a sequel and to be a successful film as of what they've realised here is one of the best live action anime films, with a damn near perfect if it was for slight pacing issue that doesn't really affect the film but is noticeable.Does it live up to the hype? HELL YES this film live up to the hype this is a must to watch on teh big screen hopefully were see a sequel come from it because it so needs it.Dislikes: The only flaw I spotted as ive said there was a slight issue with pacing, not that it affects the film in any way but was noticeable."
"I'm a 47 year old man who went to film school. I loved this movie. There's no point in trying to dissect what Alita: Battle Angel got right or wrong in terms of script or pacing or character development or whatever else film snobs like to blather on about. This is just a fun, action-packed first installment of what I hope will at least be a trilogy, if not more. And they couldn't have cast Alita more perfectly, even if her on-screen form is completely digital. Great movie. Tons of fun. Don't overthink it."
"I've always loved Anime, and it's always been frustrating watching Hollywood movies destroy it (Ghost in the shell). Alita however did an amazing job in fusing Hollywood and Anime. I believe it was a great story adaptation by James Cameron, breathtaking action scenes and directing by Rodriguez, and great casting. I saw this in 4DX 3D in Seoul and It was a roller coaster ride. I was afraid the movie might put me to sleep, but it kept me engaged and watching from beginning to end. I think the most important element for movies should be the ability to engage the audience and never let them go until the very end. This movie delivers. And also I am very proud of Director Rodriguez for taking on this enormous task. He put a lot on the line to make this film.
An interesting thing I found was for some reason I felt there were elements of John Carpenter here.
Overall one of the best 3D films made so far. I believe the bar has been pushed higher for all filmmakers. A must watch in 3D exerpience!"
"Marvelous effect with some great actions make this movie not to be missed seeing it in the big screen. But the thing I love the most is Alita herself. There were a few times I had a smile on myself watching Alita as she was so loveable and badass.
Really really hope it will goes beyond just this one movie as the world building in Alita was so fascinating and of course, need to see more Alita."
"But the romance threw us off a bit. But this is way much better than Ghost in the Shell and Ready player one.
The story was amazing, made sense, didn't jump from one element to another and the pasting was perfect. The visuals are stunning! Absolutely 10/10. But the romance...everyone in the cinema giggled when Hugo died, it just didn't work, nobody cared about the character anyway. He was simply there to have a love interest for Alita.
Summing it up, definitely worth watching, looking forward for the next one!"
"As a longtime fan of Gunnm(Battle Angel Alita), I am satisfied. I appreciate the production team took their time to do the research of the original serials. The adaptation is great, they filtered out few ""acquire taste"" and swapped in elements that would make much more appeal to general public. The film really kept true to the original manga and reassembled almost everything from the manga the scenes, mechanical bodies, characters and the world they lived in. They did a great job on capturing Alita's slightly na√Øve stubbornness, the ""all in or all out"" euthanasic, and the pursuit of who she is.
Storywise, the film ingeniously weaved the first 11 books of manga together, brought up few events that was happening in the 2nd chapter of Alita's adventure to the 1st movie. Which is nice since I bet they're already thinking of the next Alita movie. But as few of Cameron's work, the dark side and the ugliness of irontown wasn't rendered enough. The lack of depth on the ugliness made the whole plot a bit light, the emotional conflict wasn't intense enough and the romance plotline which is very important in the 1st chapter a little bit lack of depth.
The overall CG is stunning. Other than the wanted flyer and the parasite's face the rest of CG is absolute marvelous.
All in all, definite a great Gunnm movie, will definite watch it again and again till the sequel is out!!!"
"""I WILL NOT STAND BY IN THE PRESENCE OF EVIL"", an inspiring line spoken by the protagonist in Alita: Battle Angel when facing an indomitable and frightening villain got me thinking that I will not stand by in the presence of clueless movie critics giving lukewarm reviews to this excellent movie. Hence my motivation in writing this review to a film that I consider a great visionary triumph with such groundbreaking special effects not experienced since Avatar and a world-building as dazzling as last year's critically acclaimed Blade Runner 2049.Based on the manga by Kishiro, the creative combo of Rodriguez and Cameron have created a world so technically stunning and cinematically immersive that it stirred and delighted my soul during the whole movie.At its heart, Alita is a tantalizing adventure about teenage self discovery and self fulfillment, although disguised by the plot which stated the protagonist as a 300 year-old alien berserker. The story combines science fiction with martial arts in a dystopian future. The fight scenes are as well choreographed as say The Matrix but avoid over indulging in extended and repetitive fight sequences. There's a lot of exposition fitted into a 2-hour movie, hence some scenes seemed to be truncated in order for the story to advance accordingly.That said, the plot has familiar elements made new but in more interesting ways. Elements of a world constantly being monitored borrow heavily from The Hunger Games, with the adrenaline infusing Motorball acting as ""the game"". The action scenes are thrilling, at times violent but as explained earlier, never over indulges. And when such scenes are short, I found myself wanting for more, hence repeat viewing ensues.The film ends with somewhat of a cliffhanger, with fanboys like me hoping against pessimistic box office forecast that this movie will make enough money to warrant 2 more sequels to complete the overarching story of one of the most interesting female characters in one of the most visually arresting, imaginative and energetic science fiction movies of all time.Go watch Alita: Battle Angel. Highly recommended."
"Coming from the producing mind of James Cameron, Alita: Battle Angel is one of the most visually impressive films of recent memory, though it doesn't necessarily have the script to go along with those dazzling visuals. Rosa Salazar is fantastic as the titular Alita, and once again proves that she deserves more starring roles in Hollywood. The problem lies with the screenplay, a cringe worthy romance, and underdeveloped characters. But at the very least, it's a fun action film in a universe that I would love to see more films take place in.7.5/10"
"Since Titanic and Avatar, I've stopped expecting Cameron movies to be great, but having seen this on 3D Imax the other day... let's just say he and Robert Rodriguez won me over again! Alita is the best big sci-fi action movie I've seen in a _long_ time. In an age where we're just seeing the same plots recycled again and again with interchangeable, soulless super-heroes, I enjoyed the hell out of this. I'm not saying it was perfect, but I was pleasantly surprised. I could have sat in that cinema for another couple of hours, without any worry of boredom. I can't remember the last time I watched a big effects movie and felt so completely lost in it.Although I was aware of Battle Angel Alita, I've never been a massive Anime fan and never read or watched the original anime, so I had no preconceptions or expectations going in. Many of the plot themes and ideas may have been done before(**cough** Rollerball - amongst others **cough**), but you can say that about almost any movie. The real question is whether those ideas are packaged in a new engrossing story with interesting characters and the answer, in Alita's case, is a big yes.Rosa Salazar is brilliant as Alita. The level of emotion she gets through the mo-cap is astonishing, and quite honestly puts many live action stars to shame. The large eyes may stem from honouring her anime origins, but you soon forget them, and only see the character. Not only that, but in the context of the story and her past, they feel quite logical.There's a hefty dose of Robocop to her story, in a good way, whilst her character has a sincerity and (non-annoying) innocence that all combines to make her a sympathetic hero that you want to see succeed. So from my perspective, I can't recommend Alita enough! This is the kind of blockbuster I hope is successful, because I truly want to watch the sequel.As with so many big-budget effects movies, I went in hoping for the best, but expecting yet another 'all-flash, no-substance' movie, like so many of the Marvel films. I was happy to be wrong for a change.I can't wait for the 3D Blu Ray to enjoy this again, and especially watch how it was made. I may even have to see it again at the cinema, before it finishes its run... It's been a while since I could say that about a big blockbuster!"
"I don't know what to say... This movie is perfect as an Action-Sci Fi movie!.
Not too much drama. Just enough.
Cool action/fighting scene. Fights are not too long. Short and sweet.
I guess people who rated this so low.. they don't even like a Scifi/Action genre or don't know how to enjoy this type of movie.CGI is always very smooth except at the near ending scene where they going up on the pipe. Real face of his boyfriend with cyborg body looks disappointing...not neat at all...
We need a sequel!!! better.. badder!!"
"Rating 9.9/10
Wow !! Truly amazing film of this year !! Great story telling !! For director Robert Rodriguez you has created a good film !! With three oscar winning actor/actress and with a name as big as James Cameron already make this film so amazing !! Dear Alita i'm falling in love with your 'BIG EYE '. For all of you , go see it you wont regret it !!"
"I love the way the director delevoped the character. He's been successfully made not only the character fearless, but also considerate. The action sequences are also the essential elements of this movie and they executed them perfectly. I wish the script could be better knowing that it is almost impossible to build a 2-hour movie script based on a multi-volume manga to explain the whole story. But overall, this movie is worth watching and deserves to be at least nominated for Best Visual Effects"
"This movie was an absolute joy to watch and captured so much of what makes a great character driven action movie. Alita is visually mesmerizing and seamless, the CGI is as good as anything you've ever seen. What's more impressive though is not the ""realness"" of it, but how well they capture facial movements. Alita LOOKS ALIVE. She isn't lost in the uncanny valley, she EMOTES. She pulls you in and allows the full suspension of disbelief. She demands that you see her as real, despite the glaringly obvious unreal elements about her. The action sequences are done so well that they never feel like jittery clutter, that despite the incredible amount of movement and shear number of things in non-parallel motion the whole of the imagery is coherent. The actors do what they are supposed to do but make no giant waves doing so, and the story is what is clearly derived from a comicbook style, but is not wholly derivative either. Alita is a character that is both extremely powerful and yet fragile at the same time, reminiscent of Leeloo in the 5th Element. She is portrayed as real, and it is easy to cheer for her and feel for her. If you like scifi action with spectacular visuals and extraordinary characters then this is the movie for you."
"Alita is not a movie, it's a dream made real. Cyborgs + Motorball + Flying city ? In a Sci-Fi universe, with a Big Brother/ bodysnatching villain ?The manga is a masterpiece, and the movie, well, is more than that. It's a masterpiece on screen. Even better."
"I never read the books and didn't know what to expect, but honestly this was a great movie. It reminded me of several different films, but at the same time still felt like it's own unique story. Acting and directing were both superb. I'll stay posted for the sequel!"
"WHAT A MOVIE , I LOVED IT AND SO WILL YOU , GOOD STORY LINE.
I WISH THERE A NUMBER 2"
"Watched a movie with exlusive interviews on a premiere night. James Cameron and Robert Rodriguez an amazing combo created a really entertaining movie. It was fun, captivating, not too complicated, but really enjoyable none the less.It is really different from Avatar so there is no comparison here. The movie itself is really beautiful, colorful and vivid. The actors performed on real sets not CGI ones and it really shows so I would count acting as really top shelf.10/10 would watch again!"
"Was a little disappointed with the end portion(the scene where they were on the pipe) as it just felt like the plot just plummeted in the final moments. Although so, they managed to sort of save it with the final scene in the stadium! As such, i recommend giving this movie a chance due to the intense build up of the story, which was easy to follow and gave me nothing to get confused upon. A key thing to note is unlike many movies of this age, the humour in Alita: battle angel felt natural and did not feel forced in any way!"
"Screenplay Co written and adapted by Avatar creator, James Cameron and Sin City creator Robert Rodriguez. Alita is a deep film that covers a wide range of themes such as female empowerment, personal growth, sacrifice and loss.The world is wonderfully imagined. Its also incredibly beautiful. In 3D, Alita looks amazing, she's vibrant and full of life, her skin looks so natural. Some people are moaning about the eyes. But those people are missing the point that Alita isn't human. Battle Angel borrows from other sci-fi stories in places. But this is a 20 year old graphic novel series. You can't expect total originality here. But like it's cousin, Avatar, Alita manages to carve out an interesting new world for itself, which in some ways is similar to its protagonist.The film had drawn some criticism for Alita's portrayal, as overly sexualized. I would argue those critics have entirely missed points made in the film. Or perhaps they haven't even seen it yet. Without giving anything away: calling Alita out for having an unrealistically small waist and big eyes is like moaning that the terminator sets an unfair standard for men. They're not human!Whilst I really enjoyed Alita, it could have, should have, been two films. There's so much going on that at times, some scenes can seem insignificant on reflection. In the grand scope of the story some moving moments are lost. Some feel a little rushed.So overall, a good film. Personally I loved it. Visually it's stunning. If you love sci-fi, if you liked Avatar or if you're a film lover, go see it! But watch it in IMAX 3D or at least 3D. Most films aren't worth it. But like Avatar: This isn't just 3D, this is James Cameron 3D. It's made for 3D."
"Alita: Battle Angel is the first ever anime adaptation that works, and its flawless. It stays true to the source material and does the original characters and themes of the manga justice. Rosa Salizars (Alita) is some of the best acting I have seen, the facial performance and overall dynamics will leave you wanting more time with her. Genuine and fresh as well as an inspiration for many of the movies you see today, waiting for the technology to be created for this movie was completely worth it. An ambitious technological marvel that will impress you every time you watch it."
"With 3 Oscar winning actors/actress and with a director name as big as James Cameron, you wondered what is wrong with all the Critics? Yes, I wondered. So I went and watched it for myself in Hong Kong on Feb-4th 9:40am 3D IMAX showing; I'm from Los Angeles, CA on vacation. The movie delivers, on so many levels where do I begin? First, I love the continuity and the flow of the story from the first second of the opening sequence. There are just enough element and focus on each character to push the story forward and you actually care about Alita, which is where Marvel shines and DC failed; but DC have recently learned with Wonder Woman and Aquaman and their box office numbers reflected those lessons. The 3D was filmed in such a way to only use it when necessary to highlight depth and does not create nausea for even the most sensitive audiences during action sequences - super big plus on that aspect. If anyone doubt James Cameron has a hand in this movie's directing, this alone should put any doubts to rest; Alita is an improvement on top of what Avatar did for its cinematography. Some critics made comments on Alita not caring for where she comes from, I would like to dispute that here. She emphatically on many levels and many parts of the movie wanting to look back toward her past - I believe the movie made enough effort on this. I feel its balanced, any more would have been annoying and I would even tell Alita myself, focus on your present and the future. Musical scores is a 10 in my opinion, the same group that did Mad Max, powerful, spot on.Now for its negatives, they're not a big deal in my opinion. I wish the movie would be 30-45 mins longer and felt like they're reserving it for sequels with an ""s"". Gone are the days when a single blockbuster movie is meant to stand on its own, so I agree with many critics on this aspect. But can we really do anything about it? That's the big question.My personal opinion is a must see Sci-fi action flick in IMAX and in IMAX 3D, do not wait until even for your 65, 70 or 80 inch TV at home. Was going to give it 9/10 but due to idiotic critics, I move it 1 over to 10/10 to counter balance the B.S."
"I have totally underestimate the movie Alita Battle
Angel.The trailers did not seem to change my expectation of this film in the beginning. But after watching this film.
My views has changed completely.She has shown character and positivity of a example that all of us should follow. By being absolutely fearless in the present obstacles. Overcoming and outperform. To fight situations when no one dare-ed and when it seems unfavorable. To speak when no one have the courage to do so.The romance is cringy but overall I absolutely love this film. Motorball is a eye opener for me. Loved it when she leaped across the fallen robot and speed like a winner.I sincerely hope everyone catch this movie and support for a sequel.Thanks for reading my review."
Execellent story and movie! Characters are enduring and engaging. Never a dull moment. Character developments were great. Superb CG effects. Much better than any Marvel franchises which are so generic! Must see! Love it!
"Battle Angel Alita surprised me as one of the best story driven action movies of the past years and here is why:Story:
solid story-telling, no cheesy and time wasting flashbacks. Characters actions/choices are relatable and comprehensible and things do not just happen because somebody just did something totally stupid or unreasonable. Also the relationships between Alita, her ""father"" and boyfriend are built up well. Furthermore this movie was clearly made for a mature audience which is a great decision. Many movies like Star Wars and DC Hero movies have failed because they want to cater to kids, teens, families, men all at the same time additionally filling their movies up with bad/badly placed comedic elements. Alita, fortunately, has none of these flaws.Acting:
very solid acting from everyone, but the Oscar goes to Rosa Salazar who did the motion capture for Alita. She did an amazing job! When I saw the trailer and those big eyes I thought this could only go wrong but Rosa Salazar gave real life to Alita.CGI:
Fantastic! The design choices are impressive and the distinction between high-tech and low-tech battle equipment was nicely done. Movement is smooth and very realistic. Alita's facial expressions are, in my opinion, the closest to reality we can get thus far.Action:
Very well choreographed action that refrains from many cheesy slow-motions and keeps it down to the point. It is also well placed and not too scarce. Plenty of action well interwoven with story driving elements - good job!Music:
Elegantly placed and perfectly connected with each scene. Not as memorable as Jurassic Park, Indiana Jones, Star Wars or other Blockbusters, but it did it's job well.Score: 10/10 - can't wait for part 2"
"My biggest issue is that there is no clear plot and nothing actually happens. One minute it's about becoming a bounty hunter, then we're trying to go to a city in the sky and the next thing everyone's enjoying roller derby. I honestly didn't know whether I was coming or going, the whole thing have me whiplash, The special effects are stunning but without plot the whole film is just dull, superficial and a waste of time."
"First review I've ever written cause I want, no I need to promote this movie in every way I can, emotional stories, fantastic characters and an amazing plot line filled with epic moments and fight scenes that blew me away"
"Certainly one of the best movies I've seen in years. Too many critics have a PC axe to grind, and they use that filter to the detriment of doing their job in a fairminded manner.
Go and enjoy."
I have had very high expectations for Alita: Battle Angel ever since this colab between Cameron and Rodriguez were first announced. Since Last Jedi I have decided not to watch any reviews before seeing the movie myself. I watched an early screening yesterday and I were not disappointed. Reading up on some of the reviews after I were very surprised to find that especially the very first reviews from the press screenings were actually rather negative. For me this is one of the best Action Adventure Sci-Fi movies in a very long time. For me it is an easy 10.
"Gorgeous visuals, non-stop action and incredible story based off a Japanese manga. I saw it last night and I cant shut up about it today. I even went back and watched the old 90s anime OVA to see how it matched up and I wasn't dissapointed! You really gotta see it in the theaters this is some of the best CGI I have ever seen. Don't get why people are leaving bad reviews, but don't trust the haters! Alita is a winner!"
"What starts as ""Robocop with a teen girl"" turns into ""Rollerball"" and ends as ""Elysium"". There isn't anything original with the plot here and the characters are all bland and two dimensional and none of them stand out from any other generic interpretation of the same tropes that we've seen in countless previous blockbusters.
For years, Hollywood blockbusters have been ramping up the special effects and the visuals and sidelining storytelling and characters. And finally we reach the epitome of that style of film making.
No amount of visual pizazz can compensate for bland characters and bland story."
Alita was very wonderful experience of my life i really enjoyed all movie. even i dont like Robert type movies but alita was awesome attraction. i never stop my self to wath all movie and i really enjoyed. iam wating for 2nd part of alita üòç
"Seriously, this might be the best movie of 2019. Alita is one of the most likeable protagonists I've seen in a while. She almost makes you not care about the others (well, except Ido). And man, is the soundtrack phenomenal too thanks to the work of Tom Holkenborg. It is outright disappointing that as of right now a sequel has either been delayed or isn't in the works. I guarantee if a sequel of this were to come out the box office this time would outpace the original just because of how well this release sets up the next one."
"At its heart Alita is a very sweet first love story. That's the spine, and with such an adorable heroine, in so many ways, this is one movie that is impossible not to like. Add to that the fantastic city, yet another masterpiece, as impressive as movies such as Judge Dredd, Total Recall, Blade Runner, Elysium or Star Wars, to name a few. I liked the ideas behind the cyborgs, the vision of a future where what for us would be very advanced tech indeed, has in Akita's world been around for hundreds of years and comes with all sorts of possibilities, and that doctors may be as much mechanic technicians as serious medical men. The back story is sophisticated and well thought out. If you buy the dvd watch the extras first. This will greatly enhance watching the movie. All up, Alita is perfect entertainment."
"I've watched it twice and I will watch it again. This movie is full of excitement and emotions. The environment, back story, history, and the whole world that were build for it just fill my heart with joy.
As a sci-fi and fantasy fan, Alita is like Matrix, LoTR, Harry Potter, and Star Wars to me. They are movies that I can't enough of and have a never ending world for me to explore and to dig deeper into."
"I don't write reviews very often but I was so awestruck after watching Alita I've been watching the trailers again non-stop since I got home and am seriously considering watching the movie again maybe on iMax, so why not write a review.
I've been waiting for Alita to hit theaters since the first trailer came out last year, and it didn't disappoint: she is simply adorable, and to accomplish something like this with a CGI character is an incredible feat on its own. But on top of that there's a good story, some of the best action scenes I've ever seen, and what's also great is that it feels like an actual movie, as opposed to a bunch of action scenes stitched together.
I'm not giving out any spoilers but I'll say this, Alita is now one of my favorite heroes of all time, it got me excited and with misty eyes throughout the entire flick and I left the theater with a smile on my face, can't wait for part 2! So, I'd have to say that it's as good as it gets."
"Loved it. Cameron finally striked it with me this time. Never liked any of his movies, haven't even seen Titanic nor Avatar. Alita would be the exception. Loved the animation, the CGI details on Alita was awesome. I love the interaction between Ido and Alita, wished there was more on Waltz's expressing his paternal love. There is a scene there with Hugo that I felt a bit too much but I like how this heroine is vulnerable as she is strong making it feel like Alita is almost real. I wish they could use Keean a bit more than just the love interest though. He's gorgeous and he would have been Alita's awesome sidekick. I would be super disappointing if there isn't a sequel to this."
"In the twenty-third century, a colossal war known as ""The Fall"" took place and wiped out a majority of the people and resources on Earth. The only two places that remain is the poverty-stricken wasteland of Iron City and the luxurious sky city of Zalem.Now in the year 2563, Dr. Dyson Ido scouts through the scraps and finds a broken female cyborg that appears to be a relic from the great war. After her body and human brain are repaired, she wakes up and is named Alita, the same name as the doctor's deceased daughter.Not remembering her past, Alita sets out to discover her past and the purpose that she serves in this divided time. Her journey takes her through the streets of Iron City as she interacts with a mix of both humans and robots each fighting to survive in the tough world.After years of lying dormant, Robert Rodriguez was appointed to direct this adaptation of the first four manga book in the ""Alita"" series.Best known for making fast and cheap films focused more on action than story, right away it becomes clear that Rodriguez was the wrong man for the job. Needlessly setting the pace to maximum overdrive and never looking back, Rodriguez blitzes past all the background information and shoves the audience straight into the narrative. Important questions are never answered or given a passing thought as the film either expects the audience to already know all the answers or to just not care enough to bother asking.Along with the fast-paced story comes some rapid action set pieces that share the same miserable fate. Keeping track of what is going on becomes a chore as the characters whisk around the screen with their superhuman abilities. Anyone wishing to see this in 3D should pack some ibuprofen.Despite being written by the usually brilliant James Cameron, the screenplay is filled with some of the most atrocious dialogue of the modern era. Cameron's ham-fisted approach towards the themes of humanity and morals are so predictable and cheesy that is sparks a feeling of nausea every time a character opens their mouth.Even weaker than the dialogue is the overall plot, which is absolutely incoherent with no rhyme or reason for anything. Even when Cameron tries to explain anything, he lazily falls into drab expository dialogue that creates more questions than it gives answers.""Alita: Battle Angel"" boasts a solid cast on paper, but the script fails to develop any of its characters in a meaningful way. Arcs and clear motivations are nonexistent as characters do whatever the script needs them to do even if it makes no sense.Quite possibly the worst part of the script and film as a whole is is the downright insulting cliffhanger ending. After answering zero questions and setting up nothing interesting, the film has the audacity to stare right at the audience and tell them that all will be revealed once they come back and pay more money.Fairing just a smidge better than other departments, the acting is still subpar across the board, which comes at a bit of a surprise considering the supporting roles are filled by three Oscar winners.Playing the titular character is Rosa Salazar, who does an alright job. She does pretty well at blending her human emotions and robotic body into a believable character, but she tends to overact during the most important scenes.Keean Johnson plays Hugo, a motorcycle riding drifter who gets romantically involved with Alita. Johnson is mostly just a pretty boy and is never able to make his character even tolerable enough to care about.Jennifer Connelly is very cold and stilted as Chiren, the ex-wife of Ido. Not speaking above a monotone, Connelly tries to make her character mysterious but ends up being boring and uninteresting.Both Christoph Waltz and Mahershala Ali are below average in their supporting roles as Ido and Vector, respectively. Each one doesn't really seem to care and just kind of pass through each scene with little energy.With Robert Rodriguez, James Cameron, and a $200 million production budget, ""Alita: Battle Angel"" proves yet again that money can't buy quality and that even the best talent in the industry can still make a truly awful film."
"If this movie had been released 30 years ago, I would have excused it for the lack of any logic behind the behaviour of its characters because this movie leaves so many questions unanswered you are left constantly scratching your head while trying to find an explanation/rationale to the things going on on the screen.Every five minutes of the screen time you keep asking yourself why this or that thing is happening and the film gives you no answers whatsoever. A lot of things make no sense at all. To add insult to injury the end is a huge cliff-hanger.If you are a sucker for CGI, you'll be amazed. If you're seeking for a good script, developed characters and any logic you'll be left hugely disappointed.This film could be saved by the 3.5 hours long director's cut but that's not what I watched in the movie theater."
"First off I have to say I wanted to see this movie. The trailer had me and I was very intrigued. After finally getting around to seeing the film I wasn't disappointed. For me, Robert Rodriguez is hot or miss as a director, but the collaboration between him and James Cameron was everything this movie needed. The mixture of CG and visionary filming style made this movie great. I found myself really invested in the story. I hope they follow it up with a great sequel. The series is quite long and deserves more movies."
"I was hoping this movie would not disappoint, and it did not... at least in the aspect of action, and some drama, but not so much on the storyline. I understand there's only so much one can fit in a 2 hour span for a story that was originally a multi-volume Japanese Manga (a graphic novel equivalent to western standards), though I think a director's cut release would alleviate some of the over-fast paced developments and some 'holes' in the story. Overall, as mentioned in the headline, the action is AMAZING, the visuals can at times make you forget that the scenes and characters are done CGI (I saw it in IMAX and it was GREAT). Even though as mentioned, that the storyline is a bit wanting (in my honest opinion), it's enough to make one care for the characters and for the final outcome of the story. Music, sets the tone and mood as to be expected of such a release and acting is top notch from all actors.~Final verdict~
Action: 10/10
Music: 9/10
Storyline: 7/10
OVERALL: 9/10 (must see as a 'Sci-fi action flick of the year')"
"Easily my most entertaining film of this year and probably my favourite so far. This is a film that is designed to be seen on the biggest screen possible, the visual effects are incredible, action sequences are unique and well choreographed. The movie is worth seeing alone for the 'Motorball' sequences. The acting is good all around, Alita is well voiced and motion captured, her personality is likeable and it's great seeing her go from friendly to unkillable badass. Christoph Waltz/Jennifer Connelly & Mahershaha Ali are all as good as expected and everyone is clearly having a blast. Yeah the dialogue is very cheesy at times, the plot skips around at a bit and loses some focus and the ending is a bit of a cliffhanger and hopefully this film is financially successful enough to get a sequel as it does deserve it. Go and see Alita on the biggest screen possible, it's a cinematic visual blast and well worth watching."
So many years of preparation and so many millions invested. The result? A lot to see and just to get bored from a story that is just another story to forget and nothing to learn from.
"Ever bored on a random weeknight, where you end up looking for a movie to watch? This particular night, you feel like seeing an action flick and one that is available is a movie called Alita: Battle Angel with pretty bad critic reviews. *shrug* A little cookie-cutter mindless action flick can't be too bad. And then... the moment you finish watching the movie and say to yourself ""My god... What in the world did I just watch? Rather... Experience?!?"" Well, this was me. After watching it a second time, my conclusion is that Alita: Battle Angel is one of the most spectacular cinematic experiences in a really, really long time.Alita is a cyborg whose core (a human brain with a unique and powerful heart, in more ways than one) is salvaged from a scrapyard by Dr. Ido, a cybernetics surgeon (or a doctor for cyborgs). He gives her a new lease on life, and when she wakes up, she has no memory of her past. As an innocent teenage girl (that is 300 years old), she goes through a journey of self-discovery.This is not a superhero with superpowers crushing the villain at the end kind of movie. Yes, Alita kicks the snot out of baddies throughout, but the real enemy she defeats is the enemy within... her naivety, lack of self confidence, and finding purpose. Even her awkward teen romance (which was intentional...) grows into a mature one full of forgiveness, faithfulness and devotion. She wins a lot and she loses a lot but through it all, continues to learn, never gives up and keeps on fighting. By the end, she is a warrior who knows her mission.Alita is not the only hero in the story. There were heroes in Alita's life that defined the hero Alita would become. Alita is empowered by those around her, and in return she empowers and inspires others, even people she doesn't even directly interact with. This is real empowerment... people empowering each other to be better. It is NOT someone who ""empowers"" themselves... especially by putting down or blaming others.The visual effects are literally out of this world. As a live action movie, it's nearly impossible to figure out what is real and what is not, allowing to you to really get immersed in the world they built. The attention to details is just amazing. Great characters paired with incredible action and an emotional roller-coaster of a journey makes this movie a winner.Rosa Salazar is the real gem in her genuine and convincing performance. She give her heart (figuratively and literally) in it and it shows. Christoph Waltz is also amazing as usual. Mahershala Ali and Jennifer Connelly (actually pretty interesting character arc if you look into it) are also great. Keean Johnson was a slight miss for me, but even then, he gave his best as Hugo.The score is perfectly crafted by JunkieXL (Mad Max: Fury Road). You can actually watch videos of how he built the themes for each of the characters on his YouTube channel. If you understand the themes, you can literally re-experience the entire movie just by listening to the soundtrack, which masterfully tells the story.Considerations: The movie is extremely violent, borderline Rated-R. There is also one use of the F-bomb (though... probably the only way to convey the intended message in that dire situation).Recommendation: 10/10. HD a must, 3D if possible (The movie was meant to be seen in 3D). Also, buy the Blu-Ray for family and friends, and tell them to do the same if they like Alita!!"
"Heart felt story of a naive young woman/cyborg transforming into an empowering heroine. Story is fast pace and dialog tight; combination of which makes Alita Battle Angel 122 minute movie felt short. CGI, especially in IMAX, is enriching and superbly detailed. Alita, despite her enlarge pupil and cyborg body, looks and feels like a real character. This is a must own 4K Blu-Ray for repeat viewing because lots of details are overlooked on first viewing due to sensory overload. Highly recommended and a must see movie because like fine wine, Alita:BA ages better with time."
"With so the abysmal movies Hollywood is making these days this movie was a breath of fresh air. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. Not just stunning CGI, but great writing, good character development, compelling story, and amazing performance by Rosa Salazar! This is a strong female lead I can get onboard with. This is one of those rare films that will have a cult following. I really hope we get a second installment."
"Alita as a character is so great. The CGI is probably the best I have ever seen. She is charming and her story arc is beautiful to witness. For me the relationship between Alita and Dr. Ido is really beautiful. Two broken people coming together and helping to heal each other. I would go into more detail but don't want to spoil it for people that haven't seen the film. This is a must watch, even for people not into manga. I know nothing about manga and absolutely loved it."
"I don't get why many critics are too much harshing on this movie, I also did worried about this project ever since they announced that Robert Rodriguez was going to direct this movie (Because he doesn't made a good movie for a really really long time since Sin City 2005, the original Manga comic is such a masterpiece). But I did gave it a try after I keep saw the 2nd and 3rd trailers, it getting looks better and better in each trailers.With that said, I gotta says this movie blew me out of the water. With low expectation comes with better than I was expected about it, and it doesn't look messy like the critics said or I pictured of at all.In fact, this is the Best Hollywood Anime-Manga Adaptation Movie since Speed Racer 2008 (Edge of Tomorrow doesn't count because of the whitewashed) and it's RR's best since Sin City too. This movie goes boyond through the wall than I even expected, and I love the original Manga comic I felt like this movie is a dream came true for Manga's hardcore fans. A lot of things that Manga's fans want to see from the comic to the big screen finally at last.The Visual, the Storytelling, the Spectacle, the Action-Sequences, and the Execution are so perfect. Robert Rodriguez redeemed himself in this movie with his mind combine to James Cameron's heart turn out to be a good hybrid unique movie that got James Cameron's signature and Rodriguez's soul into one movie. Rodriguez brought his action sequences' style from Desperado, From Dusk Till Dawn and Sin City back into this movie, but this one beyond his level into Mad Max: Fury Road or The Matrix's territories.Rosa Salazar is the standout of this movie, she is the best Mo-Cap performer I've seen so far since Andy Serkis (Caesar, Gollum, King Kong). Her portrayal of Alita is the heart and soul to this movie, and her facial expression into Alita's CG face was beyond speechless. Rosa did brought the unique level to this amazing movie, and the rest of the cast are so impressive too. Even Marhershala Ali did gave another great performance in this movie too, and there are some surprise cameos that you don't want to miss (One came by the CG character but you will recognize her voice, one came at the end of the movie that will make your jaw-dropping so hard.)Another great thing that I want to says is Tom Holkeborg's score (Junkie XL), that will make it to be another great one of his works, just like his' score in Mad Max: Fury Road, Batman V Superman, and Divergent.I hope that the public wouldn't bullying this movie like Speed Racer, I wish it would be great enough to make the audiences love this so much that make it hit enough to get a sequel or a trilogy. My belief would be if this had a trilogy, this will be one of the best trilogies along with Star Wars original trilogy, Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Bourne trilogy, and The Dark Knight trilogy. Please go see this movie a lot, and you will have another great trilogy that you will love forever !Recommended to see it in IMAX 3D, you're going to be WOWED in this great full 2-hours experience."
"For zero and tenths, we have seen such a number of attempts to adapt anime for a Western audience, that each new project in the nineties (albeit a cult) opened from the depths of the work is perceived as being prejudiced.
Fortunately, 'Alyta' is completely different. About this we are immediately informed by familiar names from the poster - Rodriguez and Cameron. The first is the main thrashmaker in the world, Tarantino's best friend in every sense. The second is a Canadian genius, each project of which makes one draw attention to himself, even a producer.
'Alita' is a huge and developed world of the future with the good old idea about the inequality of two cities. One soars in the sky, the other rusts on the ruined earth. It is here that Dr. Ido finds a broken cyborg, recreates it and gives the name Alita.
Scenally the picture does not sag and, in general, goes smoothly along the manga with deviations into other volumes. The adaptation of the original source is always thin ice, but Rodriguez almost cracked it. He is trying to organically compare the different events of manga. And it turns out. And I understand why the director mixed different events not in chronology. This adds to the entertainment, and goes much better for the audience.
The original manga pro masters of panzer kunst were distinguished by magnificently traced fights. In this film you can rely on. Beautiful, juicy and not at all brutal battles cyborgs - it just does not seem boring.Especially when the company in such a cyberpunk adventure you make up Christoph Waltz, Mahershala Ali, and even Edward Norton. Look for him, he is somewhere in the film.'Alita' is a very simple, but pleasing to the eye and not a brain-diluting attraction, which is carefully related to the original. After all, Rodriguez himself loves everything connected with this world."
You can't help but admire the world they have created with remarkable CGI and special effects as-well as having some amazing action scenes. Its not without its problems though as they tried to cram far too much into the movie making it feel bloated. There are also pacing issues and a lack of emotional connection but it's still worth watching and preferably on the biggest screen you can find.
When I saw the previews for this movie I had no interest in it. But my gf wanted to see it. Gotta say I loved it I was into it from first second all the way to the end. Beautiful cgi and a wonderful character. You could admire this strong female character. She showed relatable characteristics while simultaneously possessing astonishing powers. This was a great example of a film showing a strong empowered female character done right. Captain marvel trash should take notes
"I would like to start off with saying that the BAA graphic novels played a large role in my growing up as a kid as they helped me get introduced to philosophy, complex character development, and grey morals. I had a feeling this film would be a dumbed down adaptation of the novels, but I was not prepared for this. The directors of this film did very little justice to the complex characters and philosophy displayed in the graphic novels. They took the most interesting and chaotic neutral character, and villainized him for no reason, taking away some of his best quirks and personality. Visual effects couldn't save the drudgery of cheesy unrealistic dialogue, inconsistent plotline, and flat character development produced by this film. My friend had to hold me back from throwing my popcorn at the screen (I am often quite a composed person)."
"Best Visual so far, the kind of movie worth it 100% watch in big screen , you will regret if you miss this amaxing experience.
Alita is amazingly great and adictive character.
the script could be better? is not perfect and little rush but good enought for a opening franchize.
I did enjoy like Kid"
"If you're into anime and special effects, I guess so.I hated it. No story. 'Human side'? Please. Like so many other stories we're supposed to buy in on this 'great love'.. based on what exactly?? Why do they 'love' each other again? Geeesh.Its dumb. If you just want lots of flashing lights and visuals then go for it, I'm definitely glad I saw it in the theater and not at home - at home this movie gets the 1 it probably deserves."
"This is a movie in the same way that Avatar the Last Airbender (2010) was a movie.It's not even really a movie.It's a wikipedia recap of a bunch of volumes.Everyone speaks in exposition, all the dialogue is cliche, there is no good acting, the pacing is all over the place, there is no build up to any scenes, no tension to any of the action, no focus on what the main plot is, little to no good character development and very few reasons to feel invested in the characters.I can't even tell you what Alita's character arc is! This movie is just all over the place and is an incoherent mess. It feels like a movie that was meant to be 3+ hours long that got chopped down to 2 hours. There is just a ton of content that is missing that is required to build up characters and to make them interesting, but instead this movie decides to use the worst possible cliches at every possible moment to try and summarize what the audience should be feeling. This movie only really works because cliches exist and audiences understand what they mean and the context in which they are used so the movie doesn't waste the time in making those moments its own.For instance, there is a scene where Alita gives a big speech, ""We need to join forces and work to find the big bad guy."" yet the movie hasn't put ANY TIME into establishing that Alita was even planning this or aiming to bring this bad guy down. Never. The audience simply understands, ""Oh, this is the riveting failed speech cliche where the protag tries to get everyone to work together."" However, the movie itself never explains why the moment is in the movie and why we should be invested in it. The entire film is like this. Just a string of movie cliches tied together to the point where the audience understands what they should be feeling at what time but they have never been given an actual explanation within the movie for the existence of those moments.This movie is literally on par with Avatar: The Last Airbender. Terrible pacing and writing and trying to cram in too much exposition too quickly.Gaah, it's just such a frustrating film to watch and I desperately wanted to like it, but couldn't. I really truly want anime/manga live-action adaptations to succeed but you can't try to cram in exposition at an insane rate."
"Stupid mess with no point. Full of loud battle scenes, nothing else. LOL. Alita has plaStic face and human brains, but was the skull metal or what? The rest of the body is metal, plastic and wires but still she eats normal food. So Alita has robot-based intestines. Yep. And Alita has a pulsating heart but how could Alita's head survive in scrapyard without any food if the brain needs organic energy and blood or some other liquid circulation? The film is full of stupid moments. Alita asks from human boy (that she loves) that does it matter thar she is a cyborg? Hah! The funniest part was when that same boy was lying in doctors bunk constructed as cyborg with only his original head left and Alita said ""He looks like feeling fine"" It is not passible this film has anything to do with Cameron."
"Think of an amazing concept, add some mind-blowing action sequences for 15 minutes, then vomit with cliche romance & boring drama for the rest 1:45 hours. None of the characters were established, no surprise element & don't know what the lead really wanted all the time.
Movie was so boring, people left right after intermission.
Great action sequences, (15 mins) good movie, so two stars for it."
"Was really looking forward to seeing this movie, massive let down. Fantastic visual effects but apart from that the rest is very poor. The story doesn't make sense, casting was poor. I really didn't care who lived or died at any part of this film. Oh sorry apart from the small dog who i think was the star of the film."
"Great movie, a good anime adaptation if there ever was one. The big thing people have a hard time getting over is the eyes, and it's hard to explain, but they actually bring her out of uncanny valley and you accept the look of the character soon enough after she is introduced. Good on James Cameron for not listening to critics. Hoping for another movie!"
I was expecting a movie for decerebrated teenagers. The result is rather nice. 3D is immersive and ... it's rare!... useful. I'm waiting for the sequel (if any) !
"Once in a while, there comes a time when a movie is constantly talked about due to its huge CGI element. Like Ready Player One, Alita: Battle Angel shares the same genes as those movies. It's already coming to an end of a decade, the beginning of the spectrum successfully wowed people merely with dazzling images and outstanding camera tricks but as viewers see this over and over again, they are numb by that so-called 'WOW' aspect. Hollywood may not acquire the thinking, but viewers want something more than 'just' CGI. Can and will Alita: Battle Angel surpass audience and critics' expectations?The dystopian city is engaging to see as it manages to explore for the first 30 mins of the film, with groundbreaking motorball sport, new gladiatorial arena, visually striking neon-coloured lights and inventive vehicles.Alita undoubtedly keeps the movie going by concentrating on the character development to drive the plot forward. Of course, it is imperative to possess the former however, it gets too dependent that the audience feels as if the movie is void of storytelling because of the meticulous details of the robotic-machinery cyborg's life.Alita: Battle Angel truly deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Visual Effects. The attention to visual details on Alita's figures is precisely well done as it blends the real-life human feat. CGI vessels into a character played by Maze Runner and Bird Box's actress, Rosa Salazar. What's spectacular is the audience will feel the humanity side of Alita as she makes careful nuances of expressions on her robotic face.It does not deliver an action-packed showcase but every time Alita knocks down on enemies, she punches just the right angles to amaze you with her slick choreographed attack movements that neither bores or disappoints viewers.Leaving the viewers bewildered, Alita: Battle Angel puts away the spotlight for introducing the focal point of an antagonist, instead we are provided by a foggy gallery of villians with each of them serves different agendas that lead back to square one, Alita.Humorless script as it is, Alita stays away from the typical sideline jokes but one will wonder hilarious things that may be bared as plot holes unless are answered such as, 'Will Alita get pregnant after an intimate relationship?', 'How does she have intercourse?' and etc.Most of the roles here are wasted due to the tremendous amount of time is sacrificed for Alita's story. Mahershala Ali's fails to show off his true villain, Lana Condor's only on the screen for a line of dialogues, Jennifer Connelly's chemistry with Alita and Ido is unbearable and Baby Driver hot girl, Eiza Gonzalez's character... erk... just shoot me already.A few scenes fail to impress the viewers, as the contents may be lame or tedious albeit they move the story forward.Verdict: Alita certainly captures the eyes of every beholder in theaters by the stunning and mesmerizing visual experience but the crew's lackadaisical attitude may drain down the greasy malfunctioning plot and it surely targets to produce half a dozen sequel after this beforehand predecessor or the least, a set of 'bermuda trilogy'."
"Believe me when I say I am hard to impress when I watch a film. This one is an absolute masterpiece. If you're still having doubts, I'll help you out. If you like the genre of science fiction, you HAVE to see this in the theatre. If you like anime, then again, you HAVE to see this in the theatre. If you like action movies, again, you HAVE to see this in the theatre. Even if you are new to these genres, this is still an objectively excellent film by the highest of standards. Instant classic, 10/10.My final thoughts go to the filmmakers:Make. A. Sequel. And if you DO make a sequel, let me just say, it had BETTER be just as DARK, VIOLENT, and MATURE as the first. Hell, you can make it DARKER and MORE VIOLENT, give it an R rating even. I loved the violence.If you come out with a sequel that is less dark/violent/mature than the first, I'll be the first person to tear apart. Don't pull a Pacific Rim Transformers Edition on me, and THANK YOU for making this beautiful, sexy, excellent movie."
"I loved this film from beginning to end, the action scenes are sensational and storyline is great!"
"I'll be honest I obviously did not know who Alita battle angel was until I saw the movie. I just knew James Cameron produced it and I was there. The movie is simply inspiring. I walked out of the theater wanting to see it again and of course I did. Graphics are off this world story is good l, Robert Rodriguez definitely knew how take make us the audience care for doc ido especially Alita. Even my father saw the movie twice of how much he liked it. Alita you deserve much more than what you are given"
"Fantastic! For what it is (a crazy futuristic distopia), Alita delivers an awesome ride with an added bonus of an old fashioned romance you don't see anymore!"
Captivating visual effects a badass backstory and an inspiring righteousness in a new world of injustice. Beautiful beautiful beautiful can't wait for the sequel. üëçüëç If you have the chance to see it in imax to really feel the action.
"One of my best movies I watched this movie 4 times lol I really like it, it is awesome!!"
"I've watched countless anime adaptions and I've not been happy with any of them to be honest. This is the first anime adaption that I have thoroughly enjoyed and it was refreshing to watch something unique. Will only people who enjoy anime like it? No. None of my friends watch anime and they all loved it.This isn't a spoiler, but a time saver: there is no post credit scene, so save yourself time when you finish watching the movie :)."
"A masterpiece, the best movie of the year and one of the best I've seen. Special care was taken to respect the work of the master Yukito Kishiro. Rosa's performance is excellent and the CGI is fantastic. Do not listen to the critics who gave very high scores to the disgusting TLJ. Please judge it for yourself."
"Don't read reviews giving this film low scores , it's pathetic and smacks of people having an agenda to misrepresent . This film is up there with the best cinematic experiences you can have , from start to finish . CGI is just enough and not fussy , unlike Transformers ,for instance , which has far too much going on in the fight scenes to take in what is happening. It's one of those films that you have to watch more than once as there is so many beautiful little touches that you don't notice first time round . Hopefully we see an Alita 2 , with the same producer/director format , a must see"
Was sceptical about this movie. Glad I watched it. Acting was great and the storyline was well written. Special effects were excellent. Well worth watching
"Alita feels like a 10 hour TV season that has been fan-edited into 2 hours. If you were a fan of the season, you wouldn't mind, because it might be fun to just chop around between episodes you remember loving.As a film though, you don't have this reference, so there is no clear arc to be aware of in the background. What you suspect would be a whole majestic episode about Alita being taken to the sunken ship, and discovering the suit is cut down into a few significant but flippant minutes culminating in a character saying ""that can't be good"" as she walks out of the water. Every potential story is treated like this, casually chopped to pieces and inter-spliced with the other.As a result, you can't engage or care about any particular element. You won't get those 'Iron Man' feelings of Alita finally emerging victorious with her battlesuit, because the build-up and empathy just isn't there. You won't feel the philosophical soul of AI or Ghost in the Machine, because there is no room for her confusion or self-awareness to breathe. You won't feel any anxiety or tension in the fight-scenes, because you've seen the slick-CGI-pre-vis'd beyond all credibility so many times before you know there is nothing really at stake.You've seen every element before, but delivered with more story-telling skill. If you have any sense of taste, judgement or cinema whatsoever, you'll be distracted by thinking what this project could have been, if someone had actually ADAPTED the source material rather than been intimidated by it and thrown everything at the wall to see what sticks.Its cheesy, corny, bland, vanilla, generic and predictable in all the ways you deeply hope we've moved beyond. Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey feels wildly interesting and inventive in comparison. Its certainly more SPY KIDS (the sequels even) than Avatar (and I'm no Avatar fan-boy)."
"I am compelled to give this movie a 10, not because I think it is perfect, I rate a movie based on the impact it had on me and how much I enjoyed it.This is one of the best SciFi movies I have seen, no longer interested in Star Wars sequels, but I can't wait to see the next Alita film.I was immersed from start to finish, the CGI and actions are groundbreaking, beautiful scenes with extraordinary details and clarity. Another showcase on the possibilities of new technology. Characters are well built.The story was enjoyable, even though so many have adapted the ideas in other films, there are still elements of originality here."
"There has been a long list of reasons why this movie may fail (bad previous manga adaptations, usage of cgi, etc), I went into this movie with alot of skepticism. However, it was more than I expected. You would think I should learn to appreciate the cinematic works of James Cameron by now, as many of his movies stand as some of my favorites. The only thing disappointing about the movie is that it never really ends, therefore I hope they do make a sequel. Christoph Waltz does an amazing job as an actor. I am deeply sold on his father-daughter relationship with Rosa Salazar's Alita. Rosa and Christoph does such a fantastic job, they deserve more praise. I would highly recommend watching it!"
