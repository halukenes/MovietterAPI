"This is what cinema is supposed to be! Amazing chemistry and acting by both leads, seamless CGI and practical effects to enhance the film, a firecracker script, a true story, pulse pounding soundtrack, booming sound mix, and edited so well that 2.5 hours flies by! Completely and utterly engaging . So good in fact I saw it twice within 24 hours . Once in Imax and once in Dolby cinema ."
"Rating 10/10
Inspired movie of the year. It is wonderfully made. A good story well told. Tightly written, well acted and directed. I hope Matt Damon and Christian Bale can winning an oscar awards because he already deliver the character very well. Thank you to all of you because make it this movie so amazing . A masterpiece !!"
"I was at the Philadelphia Film center premiere on 11/11/19 to view this terrific movie. At the age of 68 and a tifoso of Ferrari since age 8, ( 1959 ), this movie hit a nerve. Truth vs Fiction. This was a David vs Goliath movie, however Goliath wins. The movie recreates a golden era of auto Racing. It was seriously dangerous with death and injury a guarantee at every race. These drivers were absolute warriors and we're fearless. Now Ferrari winning LeMans six straight years in a row from 1960-1965 is actually the David in this movie. Ferrari for all their dominant winning form was still a tiny company that sold fancy $15,000 sportcars to support his racing team. Winning LeMans was a $16,500 team prize. These Ferrari drivers were salaried. The prototype class at that time was wide open with no upper limit on engine size. There was an under 2 liter class that Porsche and Ferrari dino control, but the over 2 liter was unlimited. I read carefully about the Ford move to acquire Ferrari, as daily news reports would cross the associated press. The movie is spot-on about Ford cars lacking desire back then. Chevrolet had the Corvette, Corvair and sporty looking Impala and Chevelle. Now Ford is the Goliath in this movie. They are the big corporate giant with unlimited resources. Ford paid for the Ford GT. It was really a Lola Gt with a Ford badge put on it. Ford put their name on every innovation provided by all the racing/equipment suppliers that went into that race car. Unlike Ferrari being designed, engineered and built handmade in that Italian factory. Ford spent more money on developing a racecar than the total price to buy Ferrari outright. Hired every Nascar team to provide expert pit crews, engine builders and offered 80,000-100,000 to each driver for one race . Now the movie, it's a movie that non race cars fans can and will enjoy. It shows how Shelby and Miles are really the heroes of the winning team. This was true. Their relationship is spot on in the movie and they know what is needed to win. They battle off the track against Ford executives and against Ferrari on the track. What is not disclosed in the movie is the quitting of the Ferrari ace driver John Surtees. When he left Ferrari, the team was devastated. He along with Ford's Ken Miles were two true warriors. Also not shown but lightly covered in the movie is the three years of disastrous outing for the Ford racing team. Did Shelby steal the Ferrari pits stop watches? Did Shelby actually throw spear lug nuts into the Ferrari pit lane to make the Ferrari pit crew think that the race car was missing a nut on the car out on the track? Did Enzo Ferrari actually tip his hat to honor Ken Miles? Who really knows. Everybody is dead. I remember the lug nut rumour in the 1960s, as that was a southern stock car trick. I never heard about the theft of Ferrari stop watches by Shelby. As far as Ferrari tipping his hat. Ferrari was known for or not attending many races. All that aside, did I as a Ferrari fan enjoy this movie. My answer is a Yes, Yes, Yes. With the exception of James Garner in Grand Prix, this is the best movie to deal with the sport of autoracing. Bonus is that it is also a great human interest story and they create the mood of the sixties as U vividly remember it. I rate this movie a ten and should be nominated for Oscars."
"Just saw F v F at the Telluride Film Festival and it is phenomenal. Perfect performances, incredible visuals and editing, immersive sound, and a riveting story. A real winner. Christian Bale lost 70 pounds Defoe the role and is a delight. Damon is spot on. Catriona Balfe is excellent. All the actors playing Ford executives are excellent as well. Masterful direction from James Mangold. A must see."
"Biopics can be a hard sell at times. Whether you're diving into the troubled life of an addict or exploring someone's sexuality, there are many touchy subjects these days. With that said, I feel there are also those that will stand the test of time, in terms of being able to please a wide audience. Ford v Ferrari is one of the latest true stories out of Hollywood that will be hitting the big screen soon, and here's why I believe it absolutely deserves attention.Following multiple characters throughout, Ford v Ferrari focussed on the fact that Henry Ford II was given an idea to create the fastest race car in the world. His mission is to take down the likes of the company Ferrari, who have held the title for years. Carol Shelby (Matt Damon) is approached by a member of the Ford team and is recruited, only to be the one finding himself recruiting the driver in Ken Miles (Christian Bale). That's the core premise and there's a lot to dive into from there.If you're a fan of racing or cars in general, this movie will be for you. This is a very well-directed film by James Mangold, and the racing sequences are quite long, taking up a good chunk of the nearly 150-minute run time. Luckily, they are very intense, practically shot, with a fantastic score to back it up, and sound effects to get your heart pumping. Everything about the exciting aspects of this film was top notch.Christian Bale and Matt Damon give stellar performances here as the two leading men in the film and I totally bought their rigid friendship that slowly developed. Sadly, without giving anything away, there is an incident that I feel was not explored enough, which slightly took away when a certain moment is meant to impact the movie. Other than that, this is a fantastic movie from beginning to end.In the end, Ford v Ferrari is engaging, emotional, and downright thrilling when it wants to be. I was invested in these characters and on the edge of my seat during the climactic races. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with this movie. There is a missed opportunity in terms of emotion during a certain scene, but I was able to forgive that, seeing as the rest of the movie was so impressive. Ford v Ferrari is one of the best movies I've seen so far this year and it will be one to see when it officially releases."
"A lot of notes were hit by Ford v Ferrari. The characters are fleshed out very well and give you the emotional attachment you're looking for in a movie. Bale and Damon's performances are great; they pull you into the story and completely disappear into their roles. James Mangold proves, once again, to be a master behind the camera. The action scenes are shot to perfection and will have you biting your nails.The film's technical aspects were top-notch as well. Wait for this film to be nominated for sound design and editing. These technical aspects, during the climax of the film, will blow your hair back and give you goosebumps.All in all, this film provides a pleasing experience for the crowd that not many films can even come close to delivering. I loved about every second of it, despite its long runtime."
"When you think of great sports movies, Rocky, Remember the titans and Rush comes to your mind. This movie won't be know as the best sports movie of all time but would surely be among the top 20. Everything that needs to be said has already been said about the two leading stars in the movie but big shout out to the supporting cast including Jon Bernthal who was great.The story is good but it's a biographical drama so not much can be changed even though there were few liberties were taken with few facts that were presented.The sound design was excellent which made your heart race faster when you heard the roar of the Ford GT 40!Cinematography by Phedon (who was also the cinematographer for the pursuit of happiness) gives us some nice shots of the race which immerses you into action.I got to watch it as part of secret preview show! It will get few Oscar nominations but doubt it would claim any big prize.
Solid 9 out of 10 for me. A must watch if you are a racing fan or a fan of good sports movie."
"I attended the screening at Fox Studios yesterday and It was so good I want to see it again in IMAX. Christian Bale deserves an Oscar nom and definitely so far, the Best Film of the Year!"
"Jesus Christ - Bale does it again.Great script, great casting, incredible acting from everyone, but especially Bale."
"The Actors were magnificent, fit their characters so well. They're performances added so much to the movie.The story, which obviously is a true tell was emotional and I recommend not looking into anything before seeing the film if you don't know already. Though I'm sure if you know the story you'll still enjoy it.Shot well too. Highly recommend this film."
"You have to have a big dump in your pants if all you're gonna do is complain about ""historical inaccuracies"" of a movie. Extremely entertaining film. Great cast, fun movie. Bale crushes it per usual."
"Ford V Ferrari is one of the best movies I've seen this year, and for someone who has little interest in cars besides minivans and SUVs, that's saying a lot. Just like the race cars produced by its namesakes, Ford v. Ferrari is sleek and fast; a powerful and expensive machine. A supremely well-balanced combination of corporate rivalry, on-track competitiveness and human drama."
Both Matt Damon and Bales performances were fantastic and brilliantly directed by James ( by far his best directed film to date!)Along with the excellent duo Oscar worthy performances the racing sequences were upmost beautifully made along with the films cinematography!Im fully confident and expecting multiple Oscar nominations on all fronts for this joyful movie!!
"Nice surprise at the Cineworld secret screening with this. Bale and Damon have great chemistry. I struggled with Bale's UK Northern accent occasionally, but a story of risk, achievement and friendship, with some great driving scenes. Would recommended, especially for any race fans.
8/10"
Honestly I went to watch this movie with zero expectation and knowledge of the plot. The film is a history of Le Mans '66 told with a thrill ride from Bale and Damon with stunning visual racing scenes. James Mangold has done a fantastic job as a director. Worth the watch in a movie theater.
"I must confess that sports car racing is probably at the bottom of my list when it comes to the type of spectator sports I like to watch. Granted, it takes a lot of courage to be a race driver. But why risk your life especially if you're married and have children? (as in the case of one of the protagonists here, Ken Miles, played quite effectively by Christian Bale).
What's more, most of the glory seems to go to the companies that put up the money for these spectacles. So in this case, we're asked to root for the Ford Motor Company with their obnoxious, win-at-all-costs boss, Henry Ford II (Tracie Letts), and his minions, who propose that Ford enter the racing game as a grand marketing promotion opportunity.
In looking at the title of this film, one can get the wrong first impression that the antagonist is Ferrari, the small Italian car manufacturer, known for its output of luxury vehicles as well as success in sports car racing. After Henry Ford attempts to buy Ferrari and is turned down, this is his impetus for getting involved in the racing game. His goal is to develop a new, blazing fast car that can usurp Ferrari's dominant position in winning one prestigious race after another (particularly on the French Le Mans circuit).
Ferrari thus has little screen time after the initial rejection of the Ford buyout. Instead, Ford hires Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) a famous driver forced to retire due to a heart condition, now with an up and coming reputation as a top notch car designer. Shelby, an aggressive straight-shooter, hires the loose cannon Brit, Ken Miles, as his driver and mechanic consultant, just as he's about to lose his auto body shop due to non-payment of taxes.
Meanwhile, Henry Ford appoints Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) as his Senior Vice President in charge of developing the Ford GT40 Mk I prototype, the super car that's ultimately supposed to best Ferrari at Le Mans. Bebbe, a buffoon of a character, becomes the antagonist, when he opposes Shelby and his insistence that Miles take the wheel during the big race. Bebbe can't stomach such a ""politically incorrect"" character as Miles and insists that other drivers test out the new Ford car at the upcoming Le Mans race. Sure enough, Ford ends up losing badly against Ferrari.
A cursory glance of the true history of all these machinations reveals that Beebe's push back against Shelby was exaggerated: the main sticking point in the film is his insistence that Davis not be the appointed driver. Historically, that never happened: the year before success, Davis actually DID race at Le Mans and lost to Ferrari.
There's more standard Hollywood treatment here with the specious suggestion that the development of the GT40 Mk 1 was mainly due to Davis's innate knowledge of car mechanics-there's a scene where Shelby rejects a computer analysis by Ford engineers and trusts Davis, with his more home-grown approach, to fine tune the car. In actuality, the Ford engineers worked in close conjunction with Shelby and Davis, and the ultimate success was truly a team effort.
While Damon's part as Shelby in the first half of the film revolves around defending Miles and convincing Ford that Beebe's approach at micro-managing will not work, in the second half, his role is really reduced to a glorified cheerleader, as Christian Bale ends up with the much juicier part of actually driving the car during the Daytona 500 ""tune-up"" and the ultimate challenge at Le Mans.
All the behind-the-scenes drama ends up as a kind of mixed bag. Shelby trying to rein in the aforementioned ""loose cannon"" Miles can be entertaining but sometimes gets a bit much (especially when Damon and Bale fight like five year olds, tussling on the ground while Miles' wife looks on). Speaking of Miles' wife, Mollie (played by the sultry British actress Caitriona Balfe), she and their young son Peter, have little to do throughout, also often acting as glorified cheerleaders.
The aforementioned behind-the-scenes drama also applies to the goings-on at the Ford Motor Company. There's a good scene where Shelby takes Henry Ford for a test drive which causes him to have an epiphany regarding the danger of driving these type of cars. As a result, Ford entrusts Shelby with calling the shots after the initial loss to Ferrari at Le Mans.
Less successful is the way the scenarists handle Beebe who is reduced to the aforementioned buffoon. I'm thinking especially of that ridiculous scene where Shelby locks Beebe in an office, preventing him from giving orders during one of the critical test races.
Ultimately, a film such as this needs to present a credible and entertaining enough behind-the-scenes drama in addition to its actual racing sequences. On that score, I will reiterate, the Ford v Ferrari ""drama"" is passable, which will hold your interest (not all of it is that ""believable"" however, on the other hand).
The racing scenes (particularly the ones at Le Mans) are particularly well done and the outcome is a bit of a curve ball (SPOILERS: with Ferrari out of the race, Miles, who is way ahead, is ordered to slow down so that all three Ford cars cross the finish line at the same time!).
The film also manages some pathos at the climax, when Miles ends up being killed in a test drive accident two months after his triumph at Le Mans. Racing aficionados will probably dig this wholeheartedly. Much lesser enthusiasts (such as myself) can appreciate the screenwriting effort, despite the Hollywood treatment."
"Based on A.J. Baime's Go Like Hell: Ford, Ferrari, and Their Battle for Speed and Glory at Le Mans (2009), written by Jason Keller, Jez Butterworth, and John-Henry Butterworth, and directed by James Mangold, Le Mans '66 (released in North American with the equally generic title of Ford v Ferrari) counts Michael Mann as an executive producer. This is notable, as Mann himself has been trying to bring an adaptation of Brock Yates's Enzo Ferrari: The Man, the Cars, the Races (1991) to the screen since at least 1993. Indeed, at one point, Mann's Enzo Ferrari was set to star Christian Bale, before he was replaced with Hugh Jackman. Whether or not it will ever be made is open to speculation, but it seems unlikely in the wake of Mann's involvement with Le Mans '66, an excellently made but unadventurous movie.Mangold is a fine director, but he's no Mann, nowhere near, and the film did, to a certain extent, leave me pondering what kind of kinetic brilliance Mann would have brought to similar material. In contrast to Mann's body of work, Le Mans '66 could never be accused of breaking any new ground or trying anything especially original - it hits all the beats, it hits them well, but it never strays from the formula. Looking at issues such as friendship, male pride, personal integrity, sticking it to the Man, art v commerce, individuals v corporations; it is, in essence, a thematically broad and aesthetically anonymous pre-auteur theory audience-pleaser made with the technology and aesthetic sensibilities of modernity. And whilst the individual parts may be unsatisfactorily safe and familiar, the whole is unexpectedly accomplished and immensely enjoyable.The film begins in 1959 as Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) wins that year's Le Mans, only to be told he has a heart condition and must stop racing. Cut to 1963, and Henry Ford II (a superb Tracy Letts, who steals every scene he's in) has just had an offer to purchase Ferrari rejected and been personally insulted by Ferrari himself (Remo Girone). Livid, Ford II determines to build a car capable of winning Le Mans, which Ferrari has won in 1958, 1960, 1961, 1962, and 1963. Ford Vice President and General Manager Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) contacts Shelby, the last non-Ferrari driver to have won the event, and asks him to design a car. He gets to work but says they'll need a great driver as well as a well-designed car. He reaches out to Ken Miles (Bale), who has a reputation as one of the best drivers in the world, and is renowned for his almost supernatural ability to identify problems in test cars after only one or two laps. However, because of his volatility and unpredictable personality, few want to work with him. He comes on board, but immediately clashes with the Ford executives, particularly Senior Executive Vice President Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas).Le Mans '66 is somewhat similar to Michael Mann's Ali (2001), insofar as it uses the grandiose moments of history to tell an intimate story - Mangold uses the determination to win Le Mans '66 as the background against which to examine issues such as friendship and the clash between gifted individuals for whom success is its own reward and corporations who don't see value in anything unless it's monetarily successful. Indeed, the argument could be made that the film is actually a commentary on the Hollywood studio system, with Shelby and Miles representing independent filmmakers who love the craft and see the medium as an art-form, whilst the Ford executives represent the studio, always more concerned with the bottom dollar than artistic integrity, always getting in the way of the people who, if left alone to work, could produce something spectacular (we'll ignore the fact that the whole thing feels like it was made by an algorithm designed to hit as many clichéd feel-good moments as possible).The film is also extremely funny in places, especially in a scene where Shelby shows up at Miles's house, and the two get into a fight on the street. Miles's wife Mollie (an underused Caitriona Balfe) emerges from the house, looks at the two men fighting, goes back inside, and remerges with a garden chair, a drink, and a copy of Better Living. She then sits down to watch the action. It's a hilarious moment, but it's one with great thematic importance - this is very much an androcentric world (Mollie is virtually the only female in the entire film), but for this brief moment, the audience is allowed to pull back and laugh at the utter ridiculousness of competitive maleness - boys will be clichéd boys, always trying to outdo each other, and getting all worked up over something as pointless as a fast car.This thematic focus, however, is not to say the film ignores the intricacies of racing; on the contrary, there's a huge amount of techno-babble concerning vectors, aerodynamics, the mathematics of torque, the torsion of metal, and the ins and outs of physics. Additionally, although thematically, the focus isn't on the races themselves, there's no denying that the aesthetic design of these scenes is exemplary, albeit familiar. Mann would have done wonders here, but Mangold, cinematographer Phedon Papamichael, and sound designers David Giammarco and Jay Wilkinson have crafted some truly intense moments. For the most part, Mangold and Papamichael avoid any objective shots (for example, there are no overheads giving us a good vantage of the entire race), and there are very few shots showing us something that Miles is unable to see. The scenes aren't shot in the first-person, but our vision is anchored to his. This, of course, contributes to a subjective focalisation and creates the sense of being in the car with him, which brings a default level of intensity, as well as giving the viewer a perfect vantage point from which to see just how fast these guys are going and how difficult what they do actually is.In terms of problems, there are only two of significance. The first concerns just how safe and rudimentary the film is. Aesthetically, although the race scenes are kinetic and exciting, there isn't anything new or inventive in them; thematically, the film doesn't say anything we haven't heard before; and structurally, it walks a very well-worn path - chances are that everything that you think might happen in Le Mans '66 does happen. This is your basic underdog story, and it adheres rigidly to that template. The character of Beebe is a good example of just how rigidly. In essence, he's a poorly written token villain because you can't have an underdog story without a token villain (usually in the form of bureaucratic interference). In this case, when Mangold feels the need to inject some conflict into proceedings, Beebe will pop up to throw a wrench into the works. His motivation? Apart from some brief references to how he doesn't think Miles is a ""Ford man"", his antipathy is never explained - the character is a Swiss army knife villain who can be used for multiple purposes, a one-size-fits-all bad guy without an iota of nuance or interiority. The second problem concerns Shelby himself, who is disappointingly one-dimensional (at best), as we learn absolutely nothing about his personal life - for example, the film makes no reference to the fact that by 1963 he was on wife number three (of seven!). Who is the film's Carroll Shelby, and why should non-racing fans care about him? We never get an answer - he's Matt Damon wearing a Stetson and speaking with a Texas drawl. And that's about all the character development he gets.Although these issues are significant in isolation, the thing about Le Mans '66 is that it's so well made, it rises above the clichéd and overly-familiar nature of many of the individual scenes, resulting in a whole that is very much more than the sum of its parts. A film about friendship and integrity rather than racing, it doesn't take any risks, nor does it bend any rules. Indeed it does nothing that could be labelled innovative. For all that, however, I couldn't help but enjoy it. It won't surprise you, it probably won't move you, it certainly won't change your life, but the storytelling is clear and refined, and the journey is one well worth taking."
"Le Mans '66 is a fast paced thrill ride from beginning to end. It tells the story of how carol shelby and ken miles built a car that could beat Ferrari in 24hr race at Le Mans where they had won the previous 4 years. The biggest strength in this film is the chemistry between the cast, good performances all round from Josh Lucas to Ray McKinnon but the whole film hinges on the chemistry between the two leads. it delivers on that front with the highlights of the film being scenes with Damon & Bale genuinely feeling like two old friends bantering back & forth about cars. Matt Damon does a great job as Shelby but can't help be overshadowed by Christian Bale who steals the movie with his performance as ken miles a man on the journey to find that one perfect lap. James Mangold does a good job with the direction you feel the gear shifts & the tension when the Ford Gt40 screeches it's breaks around right corners. There could probably more ambitious or creative shots in some of the races but in my honest opinion I think the performances Mangold got out of this cast outshines the technical stuff. The writing isn't the best and can come off as cheesy & predictable in certain areas but for the most part I felt it was well written and had a good pace to it. I'd recommend Le Mans '66 it's not 1st place but it's a near perfect lap."
"Going in, I knew this film had no shot of being a 10/10 for me. I am about as far from a gearhead or racing fan as one can be. With that being said, I was still intrigued throughout the entire 2.5 hour run time. Christian Bale dominated the screen with his performance. I expect great things from him, but he really did outdo himself by portraying the oddities and ego of his character. If you are a fan of cars or racing, I imagine you will love Ford v Ferrari."
Excellent acting by the entire cast. The race scenes convey the power and danger of the races.
"Once in a while, a big Hollywood film is made with big Hollywood stars, and big Hollywood production values and occasionally everything works to deliver a dynamic cinematic event.
Such is the case with director James Mangold's new film ""Ford v Ferrari"". Armed with superior talent in front and behind the camera, Mr. Mangold has directed his best film yet with bravado. A strong screenplay is the foundation of a great story involving the characters portrayed by Matt Damon playing American Car Designer Carroll Shelby, driver Christian Bale, and Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II, all involved in challenging the famous Italian car maker Ferrari at the famous race at Le Mans in 1966.
From the very first frame, James Mangold sets the tone with exciting, bold and energetic images that are visually arresting, alongside a great score that never overwhelms or feels generic. The editing is outstanding, as the pace is so fast moving, pulsating with nail biting excitement, especially in the racing sequences.
Cinematographer Phedon Papamichael, along with Production Designer Francois Audouy, and Costume Designer Daniel Orlandi, have created a rich canvas, always authentic in feel, full of subtleties resulting in a formidable palette that comes together beautifully.
Flawless performances are a high point under the guidance of James Mangold's direction. Matt Damon has rarely had the opportunity to show quite a range from confidant showman to a vulnerability we rarely see. Christian Bale as always disappears into his character and delivers another stellar performance, and Tracy Letts layers his performance with strength and flair.
Ultimately, James Mangold's master work delivers on all fronts, and on the whole one of the most satisfying films of the year, and certain to be a major contender for many well deserved awards !"
"Despite the love affair cinema has had with cars over the years, the sport of motor racing on film has been patchy. Too often the drama on the track has been deluged with melodrama off the track, as in John Frankenheimer's ""Grand Prix"" from 1966. While recent efforts such as Ron Howard's ""Rush"" have brought modern filming techniques to better convey the speed and excitement, it is Steve McQueen's ""Le Mans"" from 1971 that had previously set the bar for realism in the sport. But even there, there were a few off-track love stories to interweave into the action.I wouldn't hesitate to suggest that ""Le Mans '66"" is a strong contender for the motor racing high-water mark.The film was marketed as ""Ford v Ferrari"" in the US. (What... do the American distributors think their film-goers are so stupid that if ""Le"" is in the title they will think it sub-titled foreign language??). But it's a valid title, since the movie tells the true story of when Henry Ford... the second... (Tracy Letts) throws his toys out of the pram at Ford's faltering progress. (""James Bond does not drive a Ford"". ""That's because he's a degenerate!"" snaps back Ford, which kind of typifies the problem""). Marketing man Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) persuades retired hot-shot racer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) to take Ford's blank-cheque to build a car to win the Le Mans 24 hour race.Shelby enlists maverick Brit racer Ken Miles (Christian Bale) to help design and drive the next-generation machine. But neither had banked on the interference of the hoards of Ford suits, led by VP Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas). An explosion is imminent! And its not just from the over-heated brake pads!What's really odd about this film is how linear the story is. While we get to see the family life of Miles (to add necessary context to what follows) these are merely minor diversions. There are no sub-plots or flashback scenes. It just relates the history from beginning to end, enlivened by some of the best and most exciting motor-racing footage put to celluloid.At a bladder-testing 152 minutes, this really shouldn't have worked. I should have got bored and restless. But I really didn't.In many ways - bladders aside - I think this will appeal in particular to an older breed of movie-goer. It's a 100% 'sit back in your seat and enjoy' cinema treat.This is the first film Matt Damon and Christian Bale have made together, and I understand that Damon specifically signed on since he wanted to work with Bale. And there is palpable chemistry there. The movie includes one of the best 'bad-fights' since Colin Firth and Hugh Grant locked horns in the Bridget Jones films. And Damon - never one of the most expressive actors in the world - here really shines.Bale also appears to be having a whale of a time. Not having to adopt a US accent suits him, as he blasts and swears his way through various UK-specific expletives that probably passed the US-censors by! He often tends to play characters in movies that are difficult to warm to, but here - although suitably spiky and irascible - the family man really shines through and you feel a real warmth for the guy.There's a strong supporting cast behind the leads, with Tracy Letts' fast-driving breakdown being a standout moment. I wonder how many takes they needed on that for Damon to keep a semi-straight face?! Also impressive as the son Peter Miles is Noah Jupe. If you're wondering where the hell you've seen him before, he was young (Marcus in ""A Quiet Place"").Where the film comes alive is on the track, and a particular shout out should to to the technical teams. Cinematography is by Phedon Papamichael (""Walk the Line""), film editing is led by Andrew Buckland and Michael McCusker. And sound mixing - which to my ear was piston-valve perfect - is by Steven Morrow. Also worthy of note is a kick-ass driving soundtrack by Marco Beltrami that genuinely excited. These categories are fearsomly hard to predict in awards season, but you might like to listen out for those names.If I was going to pick at any faults in the film, it would be that Ford exec Leo Beebe is painted a little too much as a ""boo-hiss"" pantomime villain in the piece. It could have been perhaps toned down 20% or so.James Mangold (""Logan""; ""Walk the Line"") directs in style. From the rather po-faced trailer, you might think this is a ""car movie that's not for me"". But it really is a tremendously fun movie, with some genuinely laugh-out-loud moments mixed in with edge-of-your-seat action and some heart-rending moments.Above all, this is a film that really benefits from the wide-screen and sound-system that only a big cinema can provide. As such this goes on my ""get out and see it"" list without any hesitation! It's going to make my movies of the year: and I'm off to see it again on Saturday!(Read the full graphical review on One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook. Thanks)."
"I used to race cars, still spend a bit of time on the track, so I know this story,
even met some of the actual people involved here (I'm old), and I wanted to really like the movie more than I did. Of course the car porn was fantastic, the casual way in which iconic multi-million dollar cars were placed around the set and even some of the scenes showing the GT40 moving around the airport tarmac were very good. For the latter, they captured speed well here, which is very difficult. So, kudos. But the actual danger involved, although shown to some extent, was not given the attention really needed. I understand the dramatic demands for a movie, but I would think emphasizing the danger would only help. Just to be clear, there were two deaths in a five month period, Miles and Macdonald, although deaths and massive injuries were very common then, these deaths actually had an effect on the racing community. Also, to be clear, the Ford effort was massive, they simply hired the very best in the US to get the GT40 developed. It really was a huge disparity between Ford and any other team. In reality, once Ford got out the kinks, it was a foregone conclusion, no matter that Ferrari made amazing cars. In this regard, little was made of the genius and absolute necessity of Phil Remmington to the entire GT40 project, he was the actual development lead on the car and he was made out to be a Disney -like character, uncle Phil with almost no real role to play. Well, actually, the character of Miles, also an engineer on the project was a compiled character that included ""Rem"" but because Rem was the essential piece for GT40 development, they had to gesture towards him, I suppose. Again, it was an okay movie, very much in the genre, although a bit better acted, Damon and Bale fighting with each other, using food, a thrown wrench, the supportive, loving wife. Within the context of a buddy movie, the movie does work, but its too long and you feel it, although I did like the way Miles death accident was shown, not a lot of buildup, save for the music, and then a highspeed muffled crash, no huge histrionics after and then the both true and movie cliche line ""sometimes they don't come home."" I wanted more of the internal mechanics of that, I wanted more of Henry Ford crying in the car, a great scene, actually because both the absolute insanity of being in a racing car as well as his joy were conveyed, I thought that was a magnificent human moment, unexpected and worth the movie, on it's own."
One of the best movies I've seen this year. A reminder that not all modern movies suck.
"People who love cars must watch this movie. Those who are not interested in cars must watch. :) The acting is great, the script is great."
I generally don't enjoy going to the movies anymore since I can wait a few months and watch on our big screen in the comfort of my own home but I was excited to see this movie. We saw it the day it opened in our local theater and I was not disappointed. What a great film. Damon and Bale were fantastic from beginning to end. The characters were very well developed and you actually felt like you knew these guys! The whole cast was phenomenal. I'm not much of a race car fan but this movie had suspense and humor that made it entertaining for everyone! Well done!!
"This movie has as much traction and grip, as the car that won Le Mans 66!Another stunning performance by Christian Bale (without any body transformation this time!) and the same goes for Jon Bernthal! Yes, this movie might be 20mins to long, but it takes you on a long and exciting ride with an end you won't see coming, unless you spoil yourself with how the race in '66 ended - my advice: DON'T! it will pay off.I'm a Formula 1 enthusiast and occasionally watch the Le Mans races as well, so I wasn't aware how the race in '66 ended. I wasn't even aware of the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari back then, but this movie won't bore you with the details to much. It gives the necessary overview of the needed context, so that every viewer understands what's on the line here.I'd recommend a viewing in an IMAX for sure, to feel the sound and experience the race for yourself. Much like Rush, this movie manages to get the excitement of racing transformed to the audience, without focussing on any crashes or the (back then) still live threatening motorsport."
"Not a massive fan of motor racing or motor racing movies but i did enjoy this.
The major asset for the film is the cast, Matt Damon is very good but the real star of this is the fantastic Christian Bale, a superb performance from a great actor.
The story of an unsung British hero, a very modest and a very real hero, he did really drive a tank in WW2, is a tale very much worth telling.
It is long bit flies by - go see."
"I didn't know anything about Ford's history with 24 Hours of Le Man, really, but Ford v Ferrari does a good job of conveying of how important it was to those involved. Christian Bale's portrayal of Ken Miles is particularly impressive, making him both aggravating and sympathetic at the same time. This film is educational, engaging and it gives us the epic Batman vs. Jason Bourne fight scene we've all been waiting for."
"This movie was perfect. I really don't care about cars or racing at all. I just love Christian Bale movies so I thought I'd take my dad to go see it. He's a big car junkie so I thought he'd like it. When the movie finished, the entire movie theater clapped. That was a first for me in my lifetime (I'm 25). Bale and Damon's acting was incredible. For a long movie, it went by quickly. The writing THANK GOD was perfect. There are so many awful movies and TV shows with some of the worst writing I've ever heard. I seriously feel like we are in the dark ages of theater. There are about 2 movies a year that are good. I rarely mark movies as a 10, but when I left the theater, I couldn't help but mark it down as a 10. I loved the movie from start to finish."
Bit surprised to see the overall Box office collection... This movie deserves more....
"An enjoyable film with fun racing scenes and a great performance from Christian Bale. I'm not a car nut, which kept me from loving the movie, but not from enjoying it. It has some good comedy, important ideas about human ingenuity and passion projects, family, and business relations. A good movie, for me not a great one. Anybody who is passionate about cars and/or technology might love this movie."
"Well, this is probably the best movie released in 2019. Such a great story, such a great cast and last but not least great cars! Loved every minute at the cinema. Totally worth your money and time. Recommend this to your friends and family and they will be grateful for that."
"This Movie is fantastic, the performance of Christian Bale and Matt Damon is terrific and a very good movie overall. If you're looking for a fast speed car movie or a fast action movie like Transporter or Men In Black: International then this is not for you.
8.5/10"
"The Movie is brilliantly edited With an all cast Christian Bale & Matt Damon together its a perfect match for likeness of their characters. Matt Damon has certainly grown as an actor with versatility and we all know Christian Bale Becomes any character he portrays and is well suited to play another amazing man, Ken Miles. I love how they showed us the true Politics of the Motor Industry. Great true story, but as a Ford lover, Ford couldn't see the Forest through the trees! If wasn't for Miles And even then!!!"
"Decided to make an account and write this review just because how much I liked the movie, the acting was spot on and so was the cinematography.
watch the movie, you won't regret it."
"Ford v Ferrari is a well-made, well-shot film with some very good acting. It is also an utterly boring, predictable, by-the-numbers sports/competition success story, and that is its damning flaw. The plot contains almost conceivable cliche that can be found in this sort of movie, hitting all the usual story beats. A hastily-assembled crew of outcasts being given a seemingly impossible task against an unbeatable sports rival, dealing with their personal problems and struggling against the interference of smug, suited corporate figures who do not like the fact that our heroes are not types who play by the book, and growing as characters along the way. Directing-wise, this plot comes with all the usual accoutrements, the most obvious of which is montages where the team of underdogs progress in their quest.The result is a movie where one can easily guess all the plot points and how the next scene is going to play out. Even the lighthearted, comedic moments happen exactly the way such scenes happen in every other movie of this kind. All of this especially becomes a problem when it is far longer than it should be. And despite the bloated runtime, some story elements somehow remain underwhelming. We know that the main characters are good friends simply because the script pretty much tells us so, but this is not properly set up. Some of the context and the events that drive the story forward are difficult to figure out, although this may be less so for viewers who are familiar with the racing context and the real-life events. In addition, it is sad that for a movie titled Ford v Ferrari, we never really see the events from the Italians' side, who remain bumbling foes beset by their overconfidence throughout the film.All of this is not the say that the movie is not well-made. It is, despite the obvious CGI-y look of some of the racing scenes, and this is pretty much the reason behind my 6/10 score. If you are a diehard racing fan, or -for whatever reason- have never seen a sports/competition movie of this kind, you might really like it. Otherwise, the redeeming qualities of the picture are not enough to save it from being pretty much a total bore."
"You know the best part of the whole movie? It's not Bale, Damon or the cars. They and the cars are already on the respected list. It's the ""background music"". Every time BGM began, it pumped me up. My adrenaline rush felt amazing. It makes any car/bike enthusiast, respect their ride. I had some good cars and I'm missing them all so much right now. Returning back home from the movie, the music in my car was all the way to the sky and I sat for another few mins in the car even after reaching my destination. This is what the movie did to me.Peace out!"
"One hell of a ride, your heart will beat and race faster while watching this movie especially if you are a fan of racing cars or etc. Directed by James Mangold (Logan, Walk the Line). Based on true story about American automotive designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and British race car driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale), together they plan to compete against the race cars of Enzo Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in France in 1966. The story itself was so emotional and adrenalin pumping, I'd really recommend if you haven't know the story yet before watching this movie. I'm not really a fan of racing cars but I'm not disappointed either with this one, either you fan or not- you'll enjoy this movie.It's not just about the cars even the race or the business, that's why I liked this movie. It is personal, heartfelt, and touching. With all the long racing scene it won't even bore you, I wasn't even know before about the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari back then but big bravo on the writer and director, the racing scenes had me sitting up on the edge of my seat! This movie manages to get the audience feel the excitement and thrill of racing. A strong screenplay with phenomenal performance by Christian Bale and Matt Damon, not to mention other supporting actors like Noah Jupe and Josh Lucas. The chemistry between Bale and Damon is engaging, their characters fit so well.Solid movie from start to finish, I'd really recommend you to watch it with IMAX. One of the best movies for this year. The ending may wasn't explored enough but if you know the real story, you might know why it wasn't explored enough. It is for the best I guess."
"Well at thirty years of age this was the first time my partner and I had ever walked out of a cinema before the movie had finished...As a petrolhead I should have loved this film. I know the story, I have seen the documentaries, I have watched the old films. An actor I had been working with mentioned it to me a year previously as he had landed a supporting role, I was excited by the prospect of a new film for motorsport fans such as myself. After seeing the trailer I remained excited, and yet slightly nervous about the handling of it.After the first twenty minutes I turned to my fiance and stated ""this had better improve""....after 45 minutes, I was ready to leave. We stayed for an hour as we had bought drinks and hoped things would improve. But there was simply no way I was going to make it through the full runtime of this movie.The writing and direction is just so cliche and cheesy, it wreaks of hamfisted Americanism, how people are claiming this will be up for awards is beyond me. It could have been written by a high school drama student. There were moments that were pure cringeworthy.I am deeply disappointed by this movie, I expected far more from everybody involved. Visually it's okay to look at, as it has the budget of a Hollywood Blockbuster. But beyond that, you'll be watching much of it through gritted teeth."
"If you know bugger all about racing and don't care about an avalanche of Hollywood cliches, I'm sure you will love this. It's beautiful, Bale and Damon are wonderful as always, the sound it wonderful and there are more than one funny scene that made me laugh.However, if you are interested in racing and Le Mans, you will find this toe curling. First of all because of all the cliches are just standing in line for the full length of the movie. Most of all the ever-present protagonist-driver-changes-gear-and-reveals-that-he-hadn't-floored-the-accelerator-until-now stupidity. In fact they repeat this once every five minutes. And of course the drivers' ability to look over at other drivers for seconds at a time while they sit in a race car that does 974 km/h! Oh and of course the Hollywood cliche that never fails: Le Mans drivers that drive like it's stock car racing. Slamming into each other, going off the road intentionally, spinning and crashing out in epic fireballs ... they are all there in their vomit inducing glory. There's the totally unrealistic racing environment, handling of the race cars, driver and pit crew behaviour, a totally unbelievable person gallery and a farcical historical depiction. And of course there is the oh-so-evil suit and tie wearing villains and the oh-so-good heroes, which we are supposed to believe actually existed.Sigh! I felt absolutely nothing for any of the people at the end. Neither for the good guys nor the bad. If you are a racing fan, don't go watch this garbage."
"Few movies I will pay the expense of going to see because of the high prices of theaters these days. This is one of those films. Just came back and must say. It delivered! Well thought out and told. Matt and Christian as always shined in this project. In my personal opinion Matt & Christian are two of our times greatest actors. They don't play a role, they live it. Go see this feature. You wont be disappointed. it's a great story that needed to be told, and in the hands of those two. Well worth your time. 5 Stars*****!"
"Outstanding acting, Great movie very refreshing to watch, watch this twice rather than watching Charlie's angels."
A huge disappointment for racing fans ( and who else would watch this sort of film ?). No mention of the original designer of the GT40 Eric Broadley of British car maker Lola on whose GT mk VI the Ford was based. No mention of Denny Hulme who co-drove with Ken Miles. It's as if he didn't exist. WTF ?!The largely hammy acting by Christian Bale also a let down as Miles' brummie accent sounded more like cockney in Bale's portrayal. Really poor dialogue and not even close to the real story. The best thing about the film was the racing machinery used but in the driving sequences a car wouldn't have lasted 5 minutes the way Bale smashed through the gears.Nowhere near the class of the racing classics Grand Prix and Le Mans.
"If you're unfamiliar with the titular race, you won't slip behind. Le Mans '66 requires no prior interest in the sport in the same way that you don't need to be a boxing fanatic to enjoy Rocky. At heart, it's a character piece; a platonic romance between two men best able to express themselves behind the wheel. Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon, affable as ever) is a former racerturned-car designer. In the '60s he's hired by Ford to head up the ailing motor company's morale-boosting effort to win the famous 24 Hours Of Le Mans endurance race. And, more specifically, to beat the reigning Ferrari team while doing so.
Shelby brings in his buddy Ken Miles (Christian Bale) not only to help design the vehicle that Ford is betting the farm on, but also to drive it. The aptly named Miles is purely driven by his passion for the automotive arts and an unquenchable need for speed. Wayward Brummie accent aside, it's a lovely, warm performance from Bale. There's the trademark intensity - heightened by his geometrically sharp cheekbones - but here it's in service to a common goal, and a love of the sport. Miles doesn't suffer fools, but there's a sweetness to his family-man side and the sheer thrill he gets from racing, hooting things like ""Giddy-up!"" as he pushes the rev counter to its limit. If Miles is the heart of the team, Shelby's the head, bringing his own racing expertise to bear while also managing the expectations of the suits upstairs, including the irascible Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) and smarmy marketing type Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas). (There's a barely hidden filmmaking analogy here, as the creative visionaries struggle to keep their ideas on track while placating the needs of the executives.) Throw in Jon Bernthal as another, more amenable, exec and the cast starts to feel a little bloated, especially given that the two-hours-30 runtime is generous for a film on a largely predictable track. Bernthal's good, but did we really need another middle-man in the mix, given that Shelby already occupies that negotiator role?
Le Mans '66 truly roars into life during the racing scenes, particularly the final act show-stopper. The visceral, pulsequickening laps instantly join the canon of great race sequences, and they're a testament to the skill of director James Mangold and his team, equalling the set-pieces in any more obviously 'bankable' blockbusters. But Mangold's film isn't quite as compelling when not behind the wheel of a record-breaking sports car. For one thing, the US title Ford V Ferrari is somewhat misleading - yes, Ford are looking to unseat the Italian giants, but the latter are so little seen that there's never a palpable sense of a head-to-head rivalry. In their minimal screentime, the Italians come across as scowling stereotypes. And on the subject of stereotypes, Outlander's Caitriona Balfe is lumbered with a limited supportive-wife role as Mollie Miles. It's clear she knows her way around an engine, but she's rarely required to do more that squint with concern at a radio while her husband races. The family scenes don't quite get under the skin of Miles' compulsions in the way that First Man explored the more selfish aspects of Neil Armstrong's pursuits. It's on the physical side that Le Mans '66 really delivers - not only in the aforementioned races, but in the lo-fi mechanics, and the pit stops that canon of great race sequences, and they're a testament to the skill of director James Mangold and his team, equalling the set-pieces in any more obviously 'bankable' blockbusters. But Mangold's film isn't quite as compelling when not behind the wheel of a record-breaking sports car. For one thing, the US title Ford V Ferrari is somewhat misleading - yes, Ford are looking to unseat the Italian giants, but the latter are so little seen take an eternity in comparison to modern-day refuelling methods. The film is a visual treat, an expertly crafted piece of sun-burnished Americana, with no shortage of big-screen thrills. Mangold's career to date has seen a mix of straightforward blockbusters (Knight And Day, The Wolverine) and character pieces (Girl, Interrupted, Cop Land, Walk The Line) but, for all its strengths, Le Mans '66 doesn't straddle that divide as effectively as Mangold's last film, Logan, did."
"Laugh, cry, get the feels, this movie has it all. Christian bale shines as always and Matt damon loves chewing gum. I wonder what kind of gum he was chewing for 78% of the movie. Anyway it was great I just thought that was funny. If you love cars it's a plus. I almost skeeted my pants like 4 times during this movie."
"James Mangold fires a dart and hits the mark once again in his unique style and vision of the facts. A perfect film, exciting and with incredible energy. Perfect cast, from Jon Bernthal to Matt Damon, from Remo Girone to, of course, Mr. Christian Bale, the one who steals the scene and certainly in one of the strongest and most expressive interpretations of his career. Film that tells the story of the American dream in the racing circus and of the indomitable Ferrari. Flawless, beautiful and risky: perfect."
"I don't care about the historical accuracy. I'm not a big racing fan. I saw this movie at the request of spending a birthday with family. WOW. Bale is beyond amazing. Damon is excellent but Bale had a better character to portray. If he doesn't win an Oscar, he's been robbed. This movie is not what you expect and it's superb."
"Great cast, great script, just works on every level as a fun and complex father/son story. Watch this on a big screen!"
"The movie was done really, really good. I enjoyed it very much and i have no cons to disclose. The movie was simply fantastic, and you'll learn a few critical things as well about the history of Ford & Ferrari. Two thumbs up."
"Outstanding performances - Bale was perfect, but this film was and felt too long. Some scenes weren't needed and others could've been trimmed down to make this film more inviting for the entire ride. The father-son relationship took up way too much of the films time as it really was pointless to be that relevant when nothing really came out from it. Pacing could've also been better in most of the non-relevant scenes. Production value, sets and era cars were outstanding, the score/soundtrack very fitting, and the cinematography incredible. Great biopic story that needed to be told. It's an 8/10 from me"
"I went into Ford v Ferrari a little unsure, as I'm not a huge racing fan, and wondered if the movie might be boring to me. My worry was unfounded - Ford v Ferrari is the best movie I've seen all year. It's surprisingly funny, completely engaging, historically accurate, and now my favorite Christian Bale movie. In fact, you'll forget you're watching Matt Damon and Christian Bale as they both completely disappear into their characters. So no spoilers here, just a recommendation to go see a great movie."
"Ford V Ferrari (Director. James Mangold)James Magild once again delivers us another bloody great film. Ford v Ferrari is wild and thrilling film which I seriously did it expect to enjoy so much.At 153 minutes, the pacing honestly flies by. I wouldn't say it needed trimming down at all. The whole film is a load of fun, thanks to brilliant performances, a great script and racing scenes which are brilliantly directed and filled with so much energy. The last race is honestly so well done, it is one of the best film moments of the year. The visual effects are for the most part spectacular. Even the more drama scenes are still just as interesting.
Also ther racing scenes are downright brilliant with their sound mixing and editing.
Christian Bale once again proves he is one of the best actors of this generation. He alone makes the film worth watching. Noah Jupe, Matt Damon, Jon Berthnal and the rest of the cast are so amazing as well.
Overall it's one of the most energetic and memorable films of the year. Mangold is such an ace director and his talent really shines here. It's a really stylish film and such a likeable film and definitely worth watching.Overall Rating: A-"
"""There's a point at 7000 RPM where everything fades. The machine becomes weightless. It disappears. All that's left, a body moving through space and time. At 7000 RPM, that's where you meet it. That's where it waits for you.""Incredible movie! 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼 I've always loved car racing & this film that tells about the events in the 3 years leading up to & the actual 1966 24 hours of Le Mans race that showcases the rivalry between Ford & Ferrari totally brings home the trophy. Well written, acted, directed, edited, etc. it's the whole damn package. What heart & soul Christian Bale pours into the role of sports car racing engineer & driver, Ken Miles, with Matt Damon as Carroll Shelby (automotive designer & race car driver) coming in with a very close second. Great supporting cast with Jon Bernthal as the famous Lee Iacocca, Josh Lucas as Leo Beebe, Ray McKinnon as Phil Remington, Caitriona Balfe as Mollie Miles, & Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II. Not once in its 2 & a half hour run time did I get bored.The score by Marco Beltrami & Buck Sanders drove the movie just right & even has a track called ""7000 RPM"".Well done & major kudos all around. I predict some Oscar noms for this.."
"Matt Damon, Christian Bale and Caitriona Balfe thoroughly inhabit their characters - that's the best thing about this movie, I think. Each of them has multiple scenes in which they are alternately charming and sympathetic. I was a teen when the historical events depicted in the movie occurred, and I remember some of them, which made this especially interesting to me. Occasionally the film falters when it succumbs to cliche, for example when it depicts the relentless efforts of Henry Ford II's kissing, sniveling right-hand man to undermine our heroes. But when the focus is in the lead characters and the road racing, it's a strong pic. I recommend it, especially if you have any interest in international racing history."
"Matt Damon and Christian Bale both gave terrific performances, but I felt like the movie was lacking something throughout. In a movie about trying to build the world's fastest car they never show anyone actually build a car. It sets up a problem and then cuts immediately to the solution. I also feel like the ending is 20 minutes too long."
"Like many American films this title attempts to rewrite history.
The truth is that Ferrari were the complete underdog. What actually happened is that huge behemoth motor company Ford tried to buy the tiny Ferrari and Enzo said no. Ford threw their toys out of the pram and decided to build the GT40. With their limitless budget it took a few years for them to finally succeed at beating the tiny Ferrari company at Le Mans. And even when they did, Ford used a 5 litre engine versus Ferrari's 3 litre.
This film needs remaking to tell what really happened and who the reall heroes were. They would be wearing red overalls thats for sure."
"It is inherently uninteresting. A mega corporation gives a blank check to win a race, and they do. The film's crime however is it won't commit to this-Americanism is unfashionable today, so it wants it both ways, they're soulless villains same time as the Italians are othered bordering on Red Dawn-esque (for the crime of being a competent boutique car company?) Similar to First Man they hope no one will notice the misfire. Plus too many scenes of life lessons and a trademark killjoy biopic wife extend this half an hour too long...how many times can they bring out the exact same scene of Josh Lucas being a jerk or the wife being movie-wifey? But that is a great Christian Bale performance. He knows exactly how to register and where to pinpoint every beat. He's like the ultimate older brother. It's an example where good taste should have brought others into its wavelength, expanding why what he was doing worked and pulling the monotonous and contrived Josh Lucas nonsense they hammer into the ground scene after scene."
"Ford v Ferrari was really a great movie. Just solid on all levels. Great script, acting, and story was told in a really great way. The driving sequences were really exciting and felt like we were there on the race track. Enjoyed this one alot!"
"Ford v Ferrari thrills by simulating the record-breaking pace of the cars on the tracks, but really captivates because we care deeply about the men trying to make the victory happen.
Before his back-to-back dips into the comic-book universes of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and the X-Men - in the films Logan and The Wolverine - James Mangold nimbly danced through genres in search of compelling characters. He'd make a Tom Cruise actioner like Knight & Day, but add on a bumbling innocent character to spice up the routine spy genre. He'd plunge into a conventional biopic like Walk the Line, but reinvent it with the aide of two commanding performance at the head of his Johnny Cash story.
Mangold's back at the helm of a sturdy, red-blooded American story of ingenuity and stick-to-your-guns re-invention for the spectacular new Ford v Ferrari. You've probably seen this type of story told before, but rarely this well, with supreme talents overcoming nearly impossible odds to achieve a goal everyone tells them they can't get.
It's the late 1960s, and Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) faces a serious issue. The Ford brand, time-tested and baked into the American popular culture, is struggling to contend against an onslaught of cooler, hipper cars. Kids coming back from the war hardly want to plunk down cash on the cars on which their dads used to depend. Ford needs bold, company-saving ideas, and Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) has one.
Iacocca wants Ford to compete on the global racing circuit. Specifically, Iacocca wants Ford to go head-to-head with the dominant force of the international circuit: Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone). To do that, Ford recruits two men with intimate knowledge of this field: celebrated automotive designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon), who raced in and won the annual 24 Hours of LeMans in 1959; and Ken Miles (Christian Bale), a hard-headed and short-tempered grease monkey who has a seamless connection to his automobiles, and might be the only person talented enough to drive the car Ford needs to build from scratch.
Even if you know the results of the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans - and the outcome has been famous in the race world since the moment the event concluded - Mangold's Ford v Ferrari captivates and entertains with the peaks and valleys of the team's journey. The riveting drama spins a classic narrative of teamwork and ingenuity in the face of stifling adversity, as Shelby and Miles constantly had to convince Ford of the risks that needed to be taken if they actually wanted to win the race, and not just contend.
Mangold recruits two of the greatest male actors working today to play his leads, but they are overshadowed by one intangible co-star I like to call ""speed."" The racing scenes in Ford v Ferrari are breathtakingly innovative, with Mangold and his team routinely figuring out new ways to put us in the driver's seat of some of the fastest vehicles on the planet. The chief obstacle facing Shelby and Miles was making their protoptype race car faster, so the tests performed in the film had to convey that achievement. Ferrari thrills by simulating the record-breaking pace of the cars on the tracks, but really captivates because we care deeply about the men trying to make the victory happen.
Bale, in particular, is fantastic as the flawed and conceited Ken Miles, a dedicated husband and father who can't help but put his passion for cars ahead of the family he loves. He's conflicted by his desire to be around for them, but unable to resist the temptation that comes with the challenge of being right about the cars that Shelby fights to design. Arguably, Ford could not have competed at 24 Hours of Le Mans without Ken Miles' contributions, and I'd shudder to think of a version of Ford v Ferrari without Bale behind the wheel.
Under Mangold's watchful eye, Ford v Ferrari tells a stirring, inspirational story about professional pride, and tells it extremely well. The screenplay creates rich, complicated characters out of its underdog-sport template (though two supporting characters drag the main plot down with their unnecessary contributions), and Mangold's precision for filmmaking helps the ride stay perpetually smooth and swift. Hollywood used to specialize in these audience-bonding crowd pleasers. Now they are few and far between, so when one speeds along and is firing on all cylinders, so out of your way to support it."
"I have to say, I am a big fan of fast cars. And I am a big fan of Christian Bale and Matt Damon. So this Movie should be good. But this Movie was Awesome! It has it all. You Laugh, you cry and it is exciting!This Movie is not made for Petrolheads only, its a Movie for everyone!"
"Greetings again from the darkness. 7000 RPM. Racing legend Carroll Shelby describes that as the moment of racing bliss in the opening of the film. We are reminded of early test pilots breaking the sound barrier, or explorers reaching the peak of Mt. Everest. What follows is two-and-a-half hours of history, rivalries, egos, and sport. The racing scenes are exhilarating, and the men are driven by testosterone and compelled to be the best. They are throwbacks to a different era. An era that wasn't about fairness and feelings, but of determination and focus that produced results - either success or failure. There were winners and losers, and the ceremonies awarded no participation ribbons.Who are these men? They are Carroll Shelby, Ken Miles, Henry Ford II, and Enzo Ferrari. Director James Mangold (LOGAN, WALK THE LINE) takes the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans and turns it into a rivalry between car makers, a friendship between racing icons, a look at corporate buffoonery that still exists today, and an old-fashioned movie that is fun to watch ... regardless of whether you know the first thing about racing or cars.Matt Damon plays Carroll Shelby, the war veteran race driver-turned-designer hired to push Ford racing into world class status. Shelby is an industry icon who won the 1959 Le Mans before retiring due to a heart condition. He then founded and ran Shelby-American for designing and improving cars. He wore cowboy hats that were only eclipsed in size by his bravura in most situations. Christian Bale plays legendary driver Ken Miles, another war veteran and bombastic friend of Shelby, who can best be described as a race car savant. Contrary to the film's title, the story belongs to these two men, and the film belongs to these two actors.Co-writers Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and Jason Keller take some liberties with the script and bend a few historical details to make the parts fit a Hollywood production ... but for the most part, the story is pretty accurate. Just a few years after the Edsel fiasco, Henry Ford II is agitated at the state of Ford Motor Company, and after a bitter and personally insulting failed buyout of Ferrari, Mr. Ford (played with proper arrogance by Tracy Letts) decides to engage in motor-measuring with the Italian company run by Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone). He hires Shelby to elevate Ford racing to elite status with one main goal - beating Ferrari at Le Mans. Shelby's cocksure approach manages to keep Miles onboard despite the internal battles with Ford executives, especially Leo Beebe (a smarmy Josh Lucas). Beebe doesn't see Miles as ""a Ford man"", and in what is all too common in corporate life, prefers style over substance.The film could have easily been titled Corporate vs Cars. Although the Henry Ford vs Enzo Ferrari segment is quite entertaining, most of the time is spent with Shelby and Miles trying to reach their dream while negotiating corporate obstacles. These two men have a love for racing and each other - in an old school, manly-respect kind of way. They are simpatico in their quest for the perfect car, and as Miles explains to his son (Noah Jupe) in a terrific scene, the perfect lap.Additional supporting roles include Jon Bernthal as young visionary Lee Iacocca (who died earlier this year), Caitriona Balfe as Miles' supportive wife, and Ray McKinnon as Phil Remington, the lead engineer on Shelby's team. Of course, Iacocca went on to become Chairman of Chrysler, where he brought in Shelby to consult on the Dodge Viper, among other models. Supposedly Le Mans racing legend and 6-time winner Jackie Ickx appears in a crowd shot, but I missed it.There is a stark contrast between the Ferrari factory and the Ford assembly line, but the egos at the top are remarkably similar. A bruised ego lit the fuse for the rivalry, but it was the car guys who made it happen. The racing scenes are adrenaline-packed and the sound in the theatre, combined with Cinematographer Phedon Papamichael (SIDEWAYS, NEBRASKA) close-ups inside the car, allow us to feel the rumble and vibration and speed sensation inside the Ford GT40. Damon and Bale are terrific. Damon struts with Shelby's confidence, and Bale (after a huge weight loss from his role as Dick Cheney in VICE) captures the cantankerous genius of Miles - plus seeing his yell at other drivers during races is hilarious. There is a comical rumble between Miles and Shelby that will remind no one of Batman and Jason Bourne, but as difficult as it is to make popping a clutch exciting on the big screen, Mangold's team comes through."
"From a production standpoint: this film is bloody brilliant. Expert craftsmanship all around from the photography, editing, acting. I imagine this was a very difficult film to make and was handled with expertise.The screenplay was very disappointing, however.The racing scenes are fantastic, but most of the non-racing scenes are just cookie-cutter and uninspired. If the racing scenes weren't so thrilling and engaging, this movie wouldn't have a leg to stand on. There are certain themes and elements which James Mangold does so well-and you can expect to see them in this film-but they're never really explored with much depth. Themes such as fatherhood, sacrifice, independence in spite of authority, what a man must do to take care of his family, a child's expectations of their father; all of these are just lifeless, dead on arrival.There's one female character in the film and she gets to sit at home and be the supportive wife to Christian Bale's character. That said, this is one of Christian Bale's best performances. He steals every scene he's in-but, unfortunately he only is ever given the same 3 beats to play. How many times can you watch him get angry when someone tells him he can't do something? Entertaining as it may be, it grows stale after a while.The two-and-a-half-hour run time feels like three. Fantastic editing not withstanding, at least thirty minutes of the film could have cut. Cut this film down by thirty minutes, and you have a serious Oscar contender. Keep it the way it is, and you have a real letdown of what could have been one of the year's best."
"Nothing really surprising or deep here, by the numbers script, showing the all-american cliches: manly American men, each more charismatic and talented than a hundred Italian men, their loving and hot American housewives, great professionals at wonderful Ford, etc. You know: USA Is No. 1. Yaaawn."
"Every year there is a film that has a little bit of everything to please anyone out there. A film that has heart, passion for a craft, strong performers, dreams that become reality - a film worth watching on the big screen, that keeps you entertained for 150 minutes. Well, Ford v Ferrari is that film.American car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) battle corporate interference, the laws of physics and their own personal demons to build a revolutionary race car for Ford and challenge Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the world's oldest active sports car race in endurance racing, in 1966.Shelby and Miles aren't doing this for fame or the prize at the end of the finish line, they do it because they love racing, building something from scratch and making it even better than ever thought possible. That's where the heart of this film lies. Just like those guys, you can tell director James Mangold and his team made this film with a passion for filmmaking. From production design, to camera movements in- and outside the race cars, to the attention to detail when it comes to costume design and historic accuracy. A true feat for Hollywood and for cinema goers worldwide.20th Century Fox/Disney does seem to want to attract an audience that's interested in cars and racing, but this film is more than just that. It's about business and family, the message this film tells without any hesitance is universal and will keep everyone intrigued for its entire two and a half hour runtime. There's never a dull moment in this what might seem boring on paper event-film. Even the longest dialogues are riddled with Bale's over-the-top face acting and writers Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth and Jason Keller made sure to have serious conversations supercharged with dry humour. Bale proves how much of an acting-chameleon he is - I've never seen him do anything like this before. Even Damon, who I'm personally not the biggest fan of, since I find him very one-note, deserves my recognition as being simply incredible as Bale's on screen ""co-driver"".The supporting cast might not be filled with household Hollywood names, but this cast is without a doubt one of the best ensembles you'll see all year. Noah Jupe (A Quiet Place) and Caitriona Balfe (Outlander) as Miles' son and wife will have many viewers look up their names. Jupe has a joyful screen presence that makes you want to protect him at all costs, while Balfe stands her ground with her mesmerising charisma. Her chemistry with Bale feels so naturally intimate, as if they're a married couple in real life - I found myself smiling every time they interacted with each other - magical! Jon Bernthal, Tracy Letts and Remo Girone each give compelling performances in every scene they bump and run.Although I said this wasn't just a movie about racing, it does have the most spectacular race sequences I've seen in years, thanks to Phedon Papamichael's off the charts cinematography, flawless VFX and the amazing sound design team. Following the cars on ground level in hair clip turns is sweat inducing and will have you gasping for clean air when stuff completely goes wrong. There's never a moment you won't believe it's not Bale himself who sits behind the wheel.Ford v Ferrari is the kind of movie everyone will enjoy. It has big Hollywood stars telling a timeless story about friendship and making dreams come true. In a year, full of sequels and remakes, what more do you want? This is one of the most entertaining films you'll see this year."
Truly awful. A more appropriate title would be Ford: the meaningless death of Ken Miles. Nothing is done to make any characters meaningful or interesting. Ferrari is absent from the film almost entirely and Italians in general are portrayed as foolish caricatures. Ford management is made to look so dumb it is a wonder the racing program even existed. This movie is not fun or entertaining. Cinematically it is also a dud. I have never been so bored looking at a GT40. The driving sequences are nonsensical and without consequence. Save yourself the embarrassment and watch James May's Grand Tour GT40 film instead.
"It's not a bad movie, but it's quite flat and nothing that you haven't seen before. Lacks in epic qualities and in depicting the true dangers of racing in those days. Forgettable soundtrack. See ""Rush"" for a far better outcome on all these aspects. The worst flaw is in the way they filmed the circuit De La Sarthe: first, there's no iconic shot on the Mulsanne straight, that's something I don't understand; secondly, they failed in showing what a grind was driving at 300kmh for three minutes, with a couple of very hard brakes. Also, they didn't show the slower classes of cars racing simultaneously, that were a true hazard. Overall, little remains for racing enthusiasts."
"Automotive geniuses sell their soul to corporate bureaucracy in effort to develop killer endurance race car. Carroll Shelby, the most beloved car designer in American history, faces the music when it comes to dealing with the Big Boys. His desire for endurance race success coincides with Ford's corporate decision to get racier, inspired by Lee Iacocco (the father of the Mustang). After that it's all individualism vs. corporate bullxxxx. I think Damon is the most reliable star out there, and it's a stretch but not too much of a stretch for him to play country outlaw Shelby. Bale is also stretch but a workable stretch for the equally individualistic Miles, a Brit racer and car designer. Henry Ford II is also magnificently played. The CGI was under control, the movie ran long but not unpleasantly so, the wrap up was a tad awkward but that happens. Appears to have captured the basic facts and feelings of the true life events, for which it deserves kudos. Could be enjoyed by non-racing fans."
"I don't what to say - it just wasn't for me. If you're not into racing or cars or the ""american dream"" I think this is probably a movie to miss. For me, it was already not my style, but on top of that it felt like a film that had recycled the plot and characters of every other sports movie and re-skinned it.Both Bale and Damon's accents were laid on thicker than ""fur on a frog"". Did I do that right? Apart from that - the performances were likely the highlight in the otherwise underwhelming film.Another issue is that at least in other sports films there's a clearer, unifying theme to the movie. This film felt confused at times. Was Ford's bureaucracy a detriment or a strength? It flipped on a dime between what seemed like demonizing and congratulating Ford. Was it about friendship? That theme did not seem apart until its final scene - leaving it as a last ditch effort to move and connect the audience to the characters. At the very least we could say it celebrated Ken Miles for his achievements in the racing world - so kudos to that."
"My Rating : 4/10Extremely average movie, OK for a one-time viewing.The high ratings are absolutely fake according to me. The story also has been embellished to confuse the facts for cinematic effect. A real downer!I am not 'H-A-P-P-Y' after watching it - that's for sure!"
"I gave this a 1 start because of the historical inaccuracies. It would seem that a large part of their target audience would be race fans, and I hope they'd know this history. Just a couple of points ... it took Ford 3 years (not 2) to beat Ferrari, and, Shelby America came up with a system for changing brakes without changing the whole front suspension (which isn't what they showed in the movie). Sure, they changed out the caliper, but the rotor and caliper, and that was it. This seems like making a movie about the moon landing and claiming Apollo 10 got their first. If you're going to make this movie, get the facts straight."
"I've never taken Christian Bale for a great actor. His appeal is for people who enjoy some kind of technical perfection and fake authenticity over substance. His performance should keep rubes occupied, thinking they have witnessed something genuine, an example of what acting is supposed to be.Moving on to the story. Naturally, much of this didn't happen. The pitting of big corporatist Ford Motors against Miles the humble car racer was all made up and I guessed it while watching the film - they just put these cliches in knowing that millions of not so bright members of the public will never get tired how many thousands of times they have experienced these tropes. Anything to get people punching their fists in the air and rooting for their hero. Read the facts of the Miles story if you care at all.The only real recommendable parts of the film and the reason I bothered seeing it, were the racing scenes which are thrilling. The rest, acting, plot are still somewhere on the starting line."
"One of the best films of the year! Great enlightenment of incredible acting and magic in editing! Christian Bale's performance is a spark of excellence as always, he's one of the best actors in this generation. If I had one complaint it'd be that Matt Damon chews way to much gum but part of me thinks that added on his glorious performance. I really hope Ford Vs. Ferrari gets Oscar praise, it deserves every bit of love."
"Maybe it's because we know the race result, so the suspense isnt really there. Some good cinematography but the race sequences are so repetitive."
"Really low effort, made-by-committee fare with no soul here, sorry.Absolutely hated Christian Bale's character and his family. Bale played a Brit loudmouth with a temper, his wife and kid played stereotypical posh Brits with a heart of gold and zero personality. They all came across as phony. Every character in this movie seemed like they were playing their modern day selves, just on a sixties set with sixties clothing.Matt Damon basically plays himself, almost like he walked off the Bourne set and put a cowboy hat on. Bam, that' was the extent of his attempt to play Carol Shelby. Total joke, I wouldn't have paid him a dollar to play this role. They really could have found someone better.The movie was an hour too long. It was dumbed down for the Thanksgiving Dinner crowd. If you didn't see the documentary, you wouldn't know what was going on. There really was nothing about the engineering that went on with making the car. It was all about Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles.Things about the movie were just weird. One character had a bubble jacket that I don't think would have been around back then. Matt Damon's character goes to meet Ken Miles' wife after a certain event, doesn't go speak to her...also, in spite of a tragic event recently happening, she and the kid act like nothing is wrong and life is great. It's really bizarre and lazy directing.I can't recommend the movie, it was terrible, sorry. The documentary is far superior. This was just bad."
