"I'm one of those people who tend to think that South Korean movies are perhaps a bit too slow-paced for my taste. Memories of Murder isn't a fast-paced film, by any means, but this time the slow pace made this movie about an investigation of serial killings so much better than 95% of its American counterparts.Essentially, Memories of Murder is a drama first with thriller and comedy elements (yes, in the first hour or so the movie is actually quite funny). Kang-ho Song and Sang-kyung Kim are brilliant as the two cops who have drastically different views on how to solve a crime. The character development is fascinating and believable thanks to a great script.Highly recommended."
"This is probably the best crime thriller I've seen since ""Insomnia,"" and contains the most haunting climax of any serial killer flick since ""Seven."" But like most films reaching for greatness, this is most admirable for its striking details.The filmmakers here craft a taut, careful, and delicately strung together motion picture that relishes in its amazing development of mood, place, and character.First, the mood: Haunting cinematography (rain falling on a small village at night, shadows darting across a thick field of grass, figures lurking in the woods, a masterfully choreographed hot pursuit scene on foot), a poignant music score (aided by the creepy use of a Korean pop song that accompanies each murder), and no-nonsense direction (peppered with fabulous doses of comic relief--how Shakespearan!) keep the film more and more intriguing at each turn and fascinating to watch.Second, the place: South Korea, circa the late 1980's, and apparently under some sort of militia rule. This is inspired by the true story of Korea's first publicized (and still unsolved) serial killer case. This unique time and place serves as a wonderful respite from the typical American big-city setting of so many other films of this ilk.Finally, the character development: The small details revealing the haunted souls of the detectives on the case is nothing short of brilliant. Witness the tiny executions of minutae: The cloth one rogue cop wraps around his boot so as not to leave scars when he kick-boxes suspects into submission, the harried chief of police checking his own blood pressure while trying to keep his off-the-cuff detectives in line or fighting to keep headline-starved reporters at bay, the young female officer desperately trying to showcase her abilities in crime solving between serving the chauvinistic detectives cups of fresh coffee, the outsider detective from Seoul's insistence that documents never lie (and the brutal irony at the climax that challenges his entire sense of being), and the main village detective's scathing speech on the difference between American FBI agents and Koren policemen. The beauty is in the details, and this film, like all the great ones, revels in their uncovering.One flaw is that some might find the film a bit long in the tooth, but this is not to be missed for fans of serial killer thrillers and police procedural movies. For the Korean filmmakers, and the amazing cast...this is their master stroke."
"I read a review about this movie and am aware what business it made in Korea, but nothing (I mean NOTHING) prepares me for this great work. With the exception of, perhaps, SE7EN, serial-killer movie has never been this good. The story (about real-life killings of 10 women in Korea during the 1986-1991) is compelling enough, but the actors (Song Kang-ho cuts you deep even when he's silent, and his big-city partner offers emotional jolts at the end), the director (effectively plays some scenes in docu-style approach), the cinematography (a shadow creeps out in the paddy field will give you, well, creeps. big one.), and the music (haunting) are welcome bonuses.One scene that impresses me most is the crime-scene midnight chase between a suspect, 2 local detectives, and a big-city detective (who doesn't know his local partners are there watching him). Humorously intense, or intensely humorous, whichever serves you well.The only regret is I saw this one on DVD, while I believe a movie this big (in many senses) deserves to be seen in theaters. Korean movies rarely touch Indonesian theaters.**** out of ****Try to listen the song SAD LETTER in this movie and tell me it's not haunting you. A magnum opus."
"Beginning in the fall of 1986 and continuing for the next four years South Korea was haunted by the nation's first recorded serial killer. Preying upon women in a remote rural community the killer was both vicious and meticulous, strangling his victims with their own undergarments and leaving nothing of any use to the police investigating the crimes. The killer was never caught.I do not envy any director trying to make a true crime film, particularly not one so high profile and so recent that the crimes still live on in the public consciousness. Stray too far in one direction and you devolve into saccharine sentimentality, go the other direction and you risk crass exploitation. Director Bong Joon-Ho avoided both of these traps by charting an altogether different route: he has made a film that is not about the killer or the crimes or the victims but one that is purely about the police officers charged with the case and the devastating emotional toll it took on their lives. In charting his unusual route Bong has created a bleak masterpiece, one that took home a stack of film awards in its native land but which has been largely neglected on these shores until now.The film begins with the first body discovered, a woman strangled with her own stockings, raped, tightly bound, and hidden in a drainage culvert. The detective in charge of the case is Park Du-Man (Song Kang-Ho) and it is immediately clear that he is out of his depth, that the entire local police force, in fact, are out of their depth. The crime scene is chaos, crowded by reporters and locals trampling over potentially vital evidence. Park himself is not what you'd call a systematic investigator, scoffing at the scientific approach and trusting in his supposedly unerring eye at picking out criminals just by looking at them. He relies on swagger and bravado and the brute force of his uneducated assisting officer Jo Yong-Gu.Serving as a foil to Park and Jo is Seo Tae-Yun (Kim Sang-Kyung) a detective from Seoul who has volunteered to assist with the investigation. Seo is the polar opposite of Park - methodical and rational - and it takes mere moments for the two to clash, clashes that lead to the two of them overlooking some key pieces of evidence.As the film progresses and the body count continues to rise you can feel a sense of desperation slowly settle over the department. Under educated, under manned and woefully under equipped the local force is simply not up to the task. As the realisation that they will not find the evidence they so badly need begins to set in Park and Jo resort to planting evidence to bring in suspects Park picks out with his 'keen eye', suspects they then set out to extract coached confessions from. The process inevitably leads to public humiliation. Soon even Seo begins to lose his faith in reason and just as things bottom out they finally catch a break and settle on a prime suspect, one who truly appears likely to be their man. But can they make it stick? What sets Memories of Murder apart from the crowd are the rich performances from its leads and the sure hand of Bong Joon-Ho. Bong knows exactly what he wants to do with this film and he steers the ship with a firm hand. He has a keen eye for imagery but he consistently avoids the cheap resolve, the quick hit, in favour of a slowly building mood and the film is all the stronger because of it. Song and Kim are both stellar in their roles, giving their characters much needed depth. You can feel their frustration and helplessness continually growing and when the final crushing blow is delivered you can feel their utter despair at being abandoned by a system that they have given their lives to. Bong isn't just asking how this could happen, how someone could be as evil as this killer, but how could a government allow this to happen? How could the police not be given the tools and manpower they so obviously needed to protect the people? The DVD release has been given the standard Palm treatment. The transfer is strong and presented in anamorphic widescreen. The film is presented with both the original Korean language track in 2.0 stereo and an English dub in both 2.0 and 5.1. The English subtitles are solid, clearly translated and easy to read. The disc also includes a reel of cast and crew interviews discussing their characters and the creation of the film as well as an extensive reel of deleted scenes.Memories of Murder is a minor masterpiece, a film that moved Bong immediately onto Korea's A-list of directing talent. It is richly detailed, beautifully performed and disturbing in precisely the way that people need to be disturbed in from time to time. Don't miss it."
"After two women are found dead in a rural community, a detective arrives from the big city to help out. Things quickly mushroom with the discovery of more bodies, more suspects and no end in sight.Whether you like police films or not you should see this movie about the real hunt for Korea's first known serial killer simply because its a great movie. This is a movie that alters your expectations and changes your view of things. Its impossible to guess whats going to happen simply because the twists and turns are so unexpected. At times this is a funny funny movie, especially if you like shows like Law and Order or CSI since what we take for granted in those shows is stood on its head. At other times this is a very taut thriller and you become as desperate as the police in needing to put an end to the madness.On top of all of this is a picture of Korea in 1986, a place with political unrest and civil defense drills that for me at least makes it seem like something out of the 1950's.This is brilliant brilliant film-making.I've given the film an 8 out of 10, even though it probably deserves to be higher, simply because some 12 hours after seeing the film, I'm still pondering what I thought of it, how good is it? At least an 8. I'm sure a second and third and fourth viewings will change my mind.Yea its that good"
"What a good movie.What a great work of casting. Perhaps a little bit long, but the most part the movie is enjoyable and there's no perfection without mistakes. I think i haven't ever seen before a Korean movie and if there are much of them like this one i shall become Korean movie fan. The tempo, the thrill, the development of characters, everything it has been well worked.The direction is good yet without emphatic resources, there are just two moments with a little much use of slow motion but it doesn't arrive to be an abuse of it.If you can see it don't loose your time with Hollywood sad-bad thrillers bet for this Korean present.9/10 cause perfection doesn't exist."
"Being a movie buff and a director in the making, I watched this film (with English subtitles, Korean not being my mother tongue), I was completely blown away by this piece of cinematic excellence. There is not a single thing about this film that I can think of in a negative connotation. I wouldn't want to give away anything about this masterpiece. All I would like to say is that this is a film not to be missed. If I want any of my movies to be globally renowned one day, I hope it resembles ""memories of murder"" in any form whatsoever.This film simply belongs in the top 10 of the greatest movies ever made. 10/10."
"My ""one line summary"" might be too subjective (well it's just an opinion after all), but that's what kind of thought came to my mind after seeing this film. It just sucked me in and didn't let away until the ending credits appeared. I'm really not a fan of this genre which is popular in various ""detective"" TV series but this film was something exceptional. A perfectly made detective film based on a real shocking murder case in S.Korea in 80's. This is a must see Korean film for everybody and this must be a real pearl for those who love detective stories because perhaps it's the best detective film ever...I give it a 10/10 this film is worth it."
"Since a synopsis would be redundant here, I'll confine myself to praise alone.Each positive comment that precedes this is accurate. I watched this movie yesterday. I couldn't take my eyes off it. Everything taking place on screen was riveting, from the simple act of walking down a dark lonely road in the rain, to a wild chase by three desperate detectives. This movie held me in thrall.As a new viewer of Asian movies, I try to analyze the reason I tend not to be interested in western works any longer. I finally came to the conclusion that it has to do with the accessibility of the players. They seem to be people first, actors by choice, and stars, by the public making them so.In Memories of Murder, I saw this human factor almost too painfully. By the end of the story, I was in tears. Even now, the mood prevails. It's been so long since these crimes took place, and I don't know absolutely that they remain unsolved, but I think it's the case, and I think about that, and how frustrating it still must be to those who worked on the case.The actors have become the people in my mind, and the horrible sense of defeat that becomes palpable eventually, is heartbreaking. When one relates to the inroads made on the health; mental and physical; of the detectives, who are ultimately portrayed as tireless and completely dedicated to the case, you realize that you've watched something that is historic. You have seen the probable truth.The way this movie draws you into it, so that you are walking through dangerous rain, with a warning shout in your throat, points to the brilliance of the director and the players.It is difficult to say, ""I love this movie"", just as it is hard to say, I love Silence of the Lambs, because love is a peculiar word to use for such fare.But yes, I love it for the fact that during it, I was in a small village in South Korea in a terrible era of sirens blaring, military dictatorship, and the hopeless pursuit of a serial killer. I landed back here in this time and place with a thud, only after turning off the DVD player, and going to the kitchen for a glass of water. While I was caught there mentally---I felt the desperation, and I felt the defeat and the sorrow of the detectives, who were essentially decent enough human beings when all was said and done.There are not many movies that can time-travel you into their present. This will do it.I most seriously recommend that you view the interviews with the director and the stars (all of them are stars of a special kind in my mind) in order to dispel some of the hold the story will have on you.These are incredibly interesting people, and it's a sheer joy to see them smiling and peaceful. They're intelligent, educated and articulate. The younger members of the cast, the less seasoned, are so beautiful in their desire to do it right.They definitely did it right. They were wonderful, and they thanked the interviewer. How lovely that was to see.I watched the movie using the English subtitles rather than the English dubbing because I wanted the authenticity. The subtitles were very good."
"Two weeks ago I happened to watch David Fincher's ""Zodiac"", then (thanks to IMDb) I found out about ""Salinui chueok"". I got the DVD of the movie instantly and saw it the very next day I saw ""Zodiac"" and the outcome? I have then decided that no other crime/detective movie can be as goo as this South Korean masterpiece. It is power packed Two and half hour movie with equal amounts of action and emotion.Set in the times of mid 80's, the period in which the military rule imposed strict rules on the civilians, a serial killer raped women and killed them. The movie follows the investigation sequences of the village policeman with the help of the police officer from Seoul. The story deepens as it goes ahead, revealing a whole lot of sub plots, each one telling the complexity of team work and human nature. The last scenes of the movie can set your tear glands to work.The last scene of the movie needs a special mention in which Inspector Park comes to the scene of crime after a long time and a girl approaches him and asks him what he is looking for. And she then tell that a man had been there at that place earlier before (suggestively the Murderer). Inspector Park asks the kid how he looked like and the girl replies, ""He looked Normal"" saying that she goes away and Inspector Park looks at the camera indicating that the killer might be one of the audience watching the movie. This scene by far is the best one I have ever seen on celluloid so far. Kudos to the director Bong Joon Ho for making a crime master piece.Note: Please do not watch this movie if you do not have respect towards cinema made in other languages and also towards other countries culture and also this movie is not for people who always want a villain in the end!. Saying that I conclude saying, one of the best two and a half hours you can ever spend your life is watching this movie!Cheers!"
"Joon-ho Bong directs ""Memories of Murder"". A police procedural, the film's first act flows along conventional lines. Here a murder takes place and detective Park Doo-Man is assigned to the case. He's a hotshot cop, hardworking and determined, who thinks he can spot a criminal simply by ""looking into their eyes"". Joon-ho Bong, however, repeatedly questions Park's abilities. Early in the film, for example, Park's commander points at two men at the far side of a room and asks Park to pick out the criminal. Park looks deeply into each man's eyes, but before he gives his answer, the director cuts to black. We assume that Park has picked the right guy.But 20 minutes into the film, and our faith in Park begins to crumble. Indeed, he begins to come across as a bit of an idiot. He's deeply superstitious, relies on fortune tellers, believes in hunches, and is highly insecure.At this point the film introduces another detective. His name is Sae Yoon, and he's been assigned to help Park on his case. The film's second act is thus a repetition of the first act, Sae Yoon re-enacting all the scenes that we just witnessed Park do. The way Park handles the film's first crime scene is contrasted with how Sae Yoon handles the film's second crime scene. The way Park handles an interrogation is contrasted with how Sae Yoon handles an interrogation. In seeing how a methodical, clever and genuinely skilled detective like Sae Yoon handles his job, the audience is forced to reconsider their views of Park. Maybe Park wasn't a hotshot cop after all. The juxtaposition between the way the two men handle the film's first two murders forces us to re-evaluate our perceptions.This notion of reassessing what our eyes see, is constant throughout the film. A mentally ill kid seems like a likely suspect, but is actually not. A local pervert seems like the killer, but is actually a caring husband. An effeminate loner may be the rapist, but DNA samples prove otherwise. Detective Sae Yoon, himself a ""by the books"" cop, eventually becomes a violent, loose cannon, determined to throw away rules and regulations based on a hunch, whilst Park, the very cop who consults shamans and witch doctors and stages false confessions, becomes the film's voice of law-abiding righteousness.And so it is the way the film's characters are constantly in a state of moral flux that makes ""Memories of Murder"" so exciting. The audience is constantly asked to ""look the characters in the eyes"" and reassess what they're seeing.But what makes the film great is its ending. If surface perceptions are inadequate, then how can we truly understand another human being? If personal emotions get in the way of objective truth, how can we ever trust our own acuity? And so because the criminal is never identified or caught, suddenly everyone is guilty. There can be no closure because everyone, police included, is implicated. Watch how the director contrasts the film's first shot (the innocence of a child's face) with the film's final shot (the retired face of detective Frank staring down the camera and directly at the audience). Frank's catch phrase, ""look into my eyes"", now takes on a whole new level of meaning. He's a cop again, and everyone including we the audience are now under suspicion. And so while most serial killer films end with closure, or in the case of the recent ""Zodiac"", with the comfortable knowledge that our killer is now old and largely impotent, ""Memories of Murder"" leaves us on a note of profound paranoia. We're left uncomfortable, disturbed, and everyone now seems a potential suspect. 8.5/10 – Though it isn't brave enough to stray far from genre conventions, this is a stylish, engrossing film. Worth two viewings."
"I have long since heard of the excellence of this korean movie on koreanfilm.org, but it was only after reading the review in detail and realizing that the score was written by Taro Ishiwaro ( a well known Japanese musician who also wrote scores for Shohei Imamura and Japanese TV serials, including The Inanimate World ), and that the DOP was Kim Hyung-gu (who also shot Musa, One Fine Spring Day and Chen Kaige's Together) that it stumped on me I was indeed missing a masterpiece.And a masterpiece it is, one deeply haunting and disturbing asian crime thriller. The mood invoked during the last few minutes of the film is something you would probably never forget.Watch this film not only for its cinematic brilliance, but also because of the mezmerising score written by Taro Ishiwaro, track no 29 on the OST the favourite on my list."
"This film is based on the true series homicide happened in the country of Korea from 1986 to 1990.Salinui chueok is similar to Seven but focuses more on the back ground of Korea at that time and explains why the police couldn't catch the murder.  The murder is very careful and cruel.  The cops are dying to catch the murder but the military government uses the police force to cease the protest.  The cops, also uses violence to the suspects to get the false confession rather than using a scientificinvestigation.After the film, I felt sympathy for the victims and was furious at the murder who hasn't got caught, yet.  This is the director's intention to make the audience look back the sad past of Korea.Excellent directing, acting, cinematography.  The best Korea film lately."
"Having seen a lot of good films this year, I picked this up after watching Thirst and wanting to see more of Song Kang Ho, remembering him being great in the Host. However, I was blown away by the fact that I never found this film earlier and while Song is excellent in it, the film and nearly everything about it is flawless in execution. The story about a detective in a small countryside town who finds a serial killer yet it's the incompetencies of the police force in general and human error which leads more and more murders. As the murders continue they find themselves powerless to use whatever clues they have to find the murderer. I'll leave it at that in terms of plot as it the film beautifully pulls you in until it's frustratingly simple conclusion. The cinematography is outstanding with a haunting score worthy of the film's amazing direction. I simply cannot find the words to describe how great this film is. I rarely watch films twice and never watched a film again without getting bored. On repeated viewings, you begin to appreciate the little scenes the director has put in and i didn't pick up one of the running gags until the third time though, they add little to the plot but are enjoyable and fascinating as the director chooses to move at his own pace. While not perfect, the quality of the film brings the smallest niggles to light and while there are only a few, this film does not get the recognition it deserves in the west, yet at the same time, it's like a little secret that is appreciated by those who are lucky enough to find it. As with any murder and mystery, you'll be looking for clues, even on multiple viewings but at best you'll be grasping at straws and jumping to conclusions until the frustratingly simple ending"
"""Memories of Murder (Salinui chueok)"" is an involving, cross-cultural take on the ""L.A. Confidential"" noir genre of a murder mystery with a political filter, layered with elements that gritty British TV detectives have mastered, from ""Prime Suspect"" on.While co-writer/director Joon-ho Bong uses the conventions of the contrasting buddy cop movie, sometimes simplistically for comic effect, he has more social commentary on his mind than a captivating investigation into a serial killer and avoids the usual titillating gore fest.Set specifically in 1986, the film visually captures the changes in industrializing, modernizing and politically restive South Korea, where new, dark, noisy factories were sprouting up in the middle of agricultural areas. From the opening shot that could be out of ""Witness,"" we see a peasant bring what looks like a city sophisticated cop to a crime scene.But that's just the start of the conflicting comparisons. We've seen enough ""CSI""s to sympathize with him immediately as he hopelessly tries to secure the crime scene for clues despite a Keystone Cops-incompetent forensics and investigative team who keep sliding into the irrigation ditch. But he starts to seem a bit of a buffoon to us as he gives more credence to gossipy tips from his girlfriend than clues from the scene and he manufactures ""evidence."" Our sympathies are curdled even more as we see him conduct an old-fashioned coercive interrogation of a developmentally disabled suspect -- and he's the good cop. Even without knowing anything about Korean law, it certainly looks like they are compromising the investigation, as his thug partner, who is nowhere as complex as Russell Crowe's Bud White, gets as out of control as a cartoonish ""Lethal Weapon"" cop, and that cop never grows and develops in the story beyond being a brutality enforcer so becomes a pathetic comic figure. Their complicit boss just seems ineffectual as he's clearly over his head with this kind of murder investigation.But through the background TV broadcasts of demonstrations and civil defense alerts and drills, we gather that their interrogation procedures were more developed through oppressing political dissidents and forcing confessions than professional criminal detective work. Ironically, they ultimately can't get the resources they need in this difficult case because of these politically-drummed up time-consumers, especially for manpower and sophisticated forensic tools that they have to beg from the FBI.The film changes tone and settles down into an intellectual thriller as a classic big city detective is sent from Seoul, and we have some of the interchanges we've seen in ""In the Heat of the Night"" and in ""Insomnia,"" as the first cop now seems even more of a simpleton in his standard operating procedures of relying on his knowledge of the locals and instincts about human nature (though even a fellow officer teases him about whether he can tell apart a rapist and victim's brother), while the city guy is looking and listening for clues and real evidence, like a Korean ""Dalziel and Pascoe."" But the tension is ramped up as the killer keeps killing  and the film starts showing us the murders as they are about to happen just as the cops are getting hints about his modus operandi and even after the police are on alert. Their frustration at not being able to stop him is grippingly conveyed by the lead actors, as each starts to abandon their usual procedures out of mounting frustration, and by the editing.A droll side bar is that the macho team is given a key clue by a policewoman who they otherwise relegate to getting them refreshments. Their macho attitudes also keep them from learning vital clues from the marginalized men they pick up as suspects.The coda in contemporary Korea is effective, reinforcing a sense of societal complicity is letting such murders happen and go on, though I was curious what happened to the city cop as well as the local guy. I had no idea until I read the IMDb message board that this was a based on a real case, so I appreciate even more that a cheap ending wasn't tacked on.The cinematography and editing are terrific throughout, with many of the scenes in the dark and rain. Particularly dramatic are harrowing scenes along railroad tracks and a tunnel that are reminiscent of stark imagery from Mervyn LeRoy's ""I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang."" It is frustrating for English subtitle readers that not more of the Korean on the screen, such as newspaper headlines or heard, such as the TV broadcasts and pop tunes, isn't translated."
"If you want to know why koreans (especially south koreans) are really into the movie you gotta know the history of 80's korea. during 80's south korea had been ruled by military government. Do you remember the siren which sounded when the killing is happen? that siren was controlled by military government. after the siren, nobody is allowed walking outside. they might think it could suppress commiees or anti-Gov gruop action.  AS you've seen the siren had become the perfect chance for murder."
"Memories Of Murder, is a highly entertaining well grafted and nigh on perfectly designed piece of cinema about the real life killings of local village girls during the 1980s in South Korea. Memories sets out to make a serious film and not trivialise these events, which it does in a very simple manner coupled with exceptional cinematography and highly idiosyncratic characters whose introductions never over shadow the films events.Memories Of Murder has its own agenda on commentating on these events, making it quite clear that the social situation created in Korea at the time meant the government was ""too busy suppressing its own citizens to put resources into a proper investigation"". And it is that which is the overriding theme throughout. There is a sense when you watch this film that the operation was completely botched. Not only did the police forces lack the necessary forces to cope with such a killer, but also that the police were more concerned with finding a 'scapegoat', as is seen in the interrogation sequences. They adopted a 'any face will do' motif, and they lost not only valuable time, but face with the public.Memories is marked by a trio of outstanding performances by Song Kang Ho, Kim Sang Kyung and Park Hae-Il who each bring something unique to this creation. Their rivalry and own internal issues mean they clash with each other and must look deep within themselves for answers while yet never distracting from the film. Kang-Ho Song provides the most intriguing of all the three detectives. At the start of the film we see he has no actual intent in catching the killer and a forced confession is enough for him to sleep easy at night, as long as he thinks he's right. However he has a gift for being able to deduce whether people are telling the truth or not by looking into their eyes. The legitimacy of this 'gift' however is questioned throughout the course of the films duration, even by his own family, which is well done in keeping the audience hooked as we want to believe in him but don't know if we should. Detective Seo Tae-Yoon (played by Sang-kyung Kim) is the enforcer of the trio, a high flying, heavy boot wearing, hot headed time bomb. His deep seated anger issues and a a somewhat noticeable lack of refined sensibilities in policing enquiries hamper a man who in the end wishes to do good and we can still sympathise if not empathise. Roe-ha Kim as Detective Cho Yong-koo is the most gripping of the three as his transformation throughout the film as he delves deeper into the depraved mind of a sadistic serial killer, begins to haunt him more than it does the other two. Having been sent in from Soeul he is charged with responsibility of finding this man and the toll it takes on him as a human being is remarkable. There are obviously more issues to discuss about how good this film is but the acting speaks for itself and is truly the driving force of this film, and 'will' keep you watching.Memories is a wonderful film, which is by no means perfect, but its fusion of serial killer thriller will drama and black humour gives this all too familiar genre a refreshing new twist, if Zodiac were any good this is the type of film it would be like, and is more often than not provocative. It's nail biting tension provides the audience with moral qualms throughout, questions over our honour, our integrity and our principles. The notion of What Is Justice? rings out loud and inevitably there are only answers to be found within yourself. While some may find the ending forced, I found it pleasant within the context of the film as it served its purpose to highlight the damage done to our three protagonists. Memories is a must watch film if you are a fan of Korean cinema or the genre, but more importantly, this is a really good film that anyone interested in film (from anywhere) should view and enjoy. This is one you 'will' remember."
"Memories Of Murder is based on a true story of a south-Korean little village in which someone begins to murder young women. The Police can't catch the killer so an agent comes from Seoul to give a hand in the investigation. Soon he'll find that local police's methods are rather brutal, and that they're most interested on finding a scapegoat, someone to blame in order to ease the in tranquility of the population, than on catching the real killer (according to the real facts, they never catched the author of those crimes).The script is solid as a rock, and it's been filmed in a realistic style. trying to show the facts as they happened. Maybe they should've made a shorter movie, and cut some sequences out (the scenes of the interrogations to the three different suspects are a little bit reiterative), and the ending seems a little forced to me. Anyway, Memories Of Murder is much more effective and serious than the most of nowadays' Hollywood detective films.My rate: 7.5/10"
"It is difficult to know how best to describe the merits of this gripping yarn. The story is very well done; funny and horrifying, like life itself. the direction, action, lighting, acting, sound; all superb. The characters are entirely believable and engaging. While the movie deals with adult themes in an adult way, it is not in the least distasteful, even when for instance one hapless suspect is apprehended masturbating at a crime scene. The one sex scene is borderline hilarious and true to life. Funniest sequence of all is when the lead detective is looking in the sauna for the hairless suspect. And when he told the sauna staff to look out for the hairless one ""They just smirked at me!"" The various interrogation scenes are very well done. The conflict among the detectives is very convincing. The economy of storytelling is such that the viewer cannot afford to miss a single minute, unlike typical Hollywood pap where you could practically go and take a bath or a a shower, come back and you won't have missed a thing. A great, fascinating commentary on Korea at that time also."
"There are only a handful of serial killer films that actually work, and with the Korean-based ""Memories of Murder,"" it's evident that director Joon-ho Bong has done his homework.Successful examples include ""Seven"" and ""Silence of the Lambs,"" a pair of films that expose their audience to grisly and suspenseful sights, but all the while creating vivid characters and memorable stories. Other films like ""Fallen"" and ""The Bone Collector"" do not. What makes ""Memories"" as unforgettable and dynamic as say ""M,"" is that the actors of this film are realistic, the story is believable, and the climax is original. You feel the apprehension of the characters, you struggle to understand the killer's motives, and you grimace at the way his victims are taken. Getting under your skin is what serial killer films are all about, and this is no exception.In South Korea in 1986, a naked woman is found bound and gagged in a drainage ditch in a field, and a pair of detectives and a special agent from Seoul has been assigned to find the murderer/rapist. Their efforts are numerous in trying to track down the killer, not taking anything for granted; they even attempt to find clues through the help of a fortune teller, and by even giving merit to the possibility that the killer may shave his pubic hair. Their crime scenes are routinely disturbed by locales, key pieces of evidence are run over by tractors, their forensic team is always a no-show, and their only help at solving the crime thus far is a handicapped boy, who may or may not be the killer. Yet with the boy in custody, and the murders continuing, a serial killer is indeed on the loose.The film has numerous touches of comedy that arguably helps the film numb down its depressing nature; many of these comedic touches involve one of the detective's constantly jump-kicking witnesses and suspects. The detective so habitually beats any and all suspects that he made a custom ""bootie,"" as to assure that his kicks won't leave any scratches. The way the film handles the humor is quite ingenious though, simultaneously showing the downfall and wrongs of police justice, the fallibility of investigative methods, and how a homicide system works without the prevalence of DNA tests. The musical score is terrific and adds tension to every scene, the camera work is top-notch and South Korea's fields and forests remain a visually scenic and eerily set landscape. The acting is genuine by everyone involved, especially from Kang-ho Song, the lead detective who sees the wrongs of the system but can only stand by and watch. The director does a fantastic job creating the mood, and like all atmospheric thrillers, the film is almost consistently covered with rain-shadow. His uncanny ability to create suspense when nothing is visibly threatening also earns the director much praise, and he makes the viewer see what the killer sees, with expert detail. As the murderer lurks behind trees, hides behind field stocks, and picks his prey, so do you and it works wonderfully. Based on the first recorded serial killer in Korean history, ""Memories of Murder"" is a film not easily forgotten. With memorable visuals, a haunting score, and quite hilariously brutal police work, the film adds realism to a very mature subject matter and succeeds brilliantly. The film was released in 2004 in limited release, and most video stores do not carry it. You can get it off Netflix or any online store that sells dvds."
"Recent Korean (and other international) films have surpassed Hollywood films in many ways except in the department of special effects. Special effects and big names is the main reason Hollywood still rules. However, for sheer originality and creativity, look away from Los Angeles towards Seoul.This grisly, dark, eccentric film shows why. ""Salinui chueok"" is a quirky, moody film that starts off not quite serious, almost comic. Well, not surprising, since the two naive, rural cops don't deal with much crime in the countryside in a militia-ruled Korea (set in the mid- 1980s). They find themselves in a case they can't handle: they have to deal with a serial murder that gathers press coverage and scrutiny. As the murders grow, detective Park has to compete with the smarter detective Seo from the big city (Seoul) and he learns solving crimes isn't just about intimidating suspects. The city and rural cops have to cooperate increasingly to try to capture the murderer. But the teaser, as all unsolved murders remains. The witnesses are unable to help, confessions are worthless, and the killer runs free. The film evolves into a serious masterpiece as Park matures throughout the movie from using police brutality to dealing with the press and proper evidence. As the end the film shows a more mature Park with a family maybe moving on...but not quite, he is still haunted by memories of a murder.Acting and cinematography are outstanding. It's a nice cultural peek into a rural Korea with unadorned eateries, schools with outhouses and broken-down police cars. The quirky fascinating characters (the half-crazy detective Cho or the simpleton Kwang-ho) add to the fun."
"This definitely is one of my favorite Korean films. On the surface ""Memories of Murder"" might appear as a simple cop-genre film. Yet underneath this costume lies an honest depiction of South Korea during the military dictatorship in the 80's. The lead actor Song Kang-ho's performance is outstanding as ever under the direction of Bong Joon Ho (The Host). The style and tone of the film constantly alludes and reminds the audience of the Japanese director Immamura Showei(Unagi, Vengeance is Mine), while the narrative structure seems too plotted according to the film's genre predecessors. For instance serial killer who gets stimulated by color red and rain while good/bad cop buddies come together in an expected fashion. However, I give 9/10 for its subtext rather than the film's outer appearance. Strongly recommend it!"
"The more South Korean films I see, the more I understand how it came to pass that filmmakers from that part of Asia are basically leading the world in terms of cinema in the 21st century.These films are always very well made, with interesting plots and characterisation. But above all, they have nuance in spades. Nothing on screen is as simple as it appears. None of the characters are typical heroes or typical villains. None of the responses to anything on-screen are simple, either.Scenes unfold in comedy and then tragedy, or the other way around - or both at once.The additional layers to every scene and every character add a panoramic realism to what unfolds. These characters live and breathe on the screen. After watching ""Memories of Murder"", ""The Wailing"", or ""The Host"", you imagine that the characters are still doing what they were doing when the credits played.That's the gift the South Koreans have given us with their wonderful and inventive cinema.Forget America, unless you are addicted to comic book movies or remakes.Korea is the one to watch."
"This one is a interesting film with a deliberate pace that starts slow, then, builds to a surprising ending.There have been several murders of pretty girls in a small country town. The two local detectives, quickly grab up a mentally challenged kid from the village. It was known that the lad liked the one victim.The two detectives administer some rather forceful third degree to the lad. They then get the lad to record a scripted confession. The case is solved and the two are local heroes.That is, till, a detective sent from Seoul arrives. This detective goes over everything and realizes the boy is not guilty. The boy is released and the local cops are less than amused with the new cop on the block.The new guy quickly shows his stuff though by going over the evidence and finding more victims. The local boys again grab up the first suspect for some country justice. Of course they are a bit too quick off the mark and this man is also innocent. The pace picks up steam as more women are added to the victim list. A woman cop helps out by pointing out all the murders happen on rainy nights, and when a certain song on the radio is played that same night.The net is thrown wider and a girl who survived an attack is located. Off her somewhat cloudy description, a new suspect is rounded up. This time the locals do not resort to the ""in your face"" interview tactics. They do not want anything that could foul up the court case. The man though does not break, and is set free. The police do however have people tail the suspect.There is a mix-up with the assignments and the tail is lost. Another dead girl is the result. On this victim there is a small bit of DNA evidence not ruined by the rain. This is sent off to the States for the FBI to examine.The evidence comes back as inconclusive. The Seoul detective knows they have the right man no matter what the evidence says. Now he goes off the dead end, he intends to kill the suspect. Does he? Not saying."
"This isn't your typical serial killer thriller. That's something that elevates this above other movies right from the beginning. But as that is, the question is if you're ready for a change? There's nothing wrong with most of the serial killer thrillers, that follow the rule book, of how to make a movie like that.Back to this Korean thriller, that shows us how cops are dealing with a killer on the loose. The behaviour of the cops (the sort of ""good"" guys) is strange to say the least. Their methods to interrogate people is at least unorthodox! And that's things you have to keep in mind before you watch the movie. Because if you think that this might be a problem for you, then it will be a problem for you for sure, after you watch the movie!"
"Based on an actual series of murders in South Korea between the years 1986 and 1991, Bong Joon-ho's Memories of Murder is a well performed, thought-provoking film about the investigation into Korea's first serial killings. The film, which combines bleak reality with dark comedy, is less about the actual crimes than about the emotional toll it took on the police officers investigating the case.The film opens in 1986 when South Korea was still under the control of a repressive military dictatorship. A woman's body is found in Gyunggi province in a drainage pipe in a rural area outside of Seoul, raped and strangled by her own stockings. The crime scene is chaotic. Reporters and spectators mill about and a tractor rides over the area destroying footprints and other potential evidence. Local police officers Park Doo-man (Song Kang-ho) and his aggressive partner, Cho Yong-ku (Kim Roe-ha) are in charge of the investigation but are joined later by a volunteer from Seoul, detective Seo Tae-yoon (Kim Sang-kyung).The police, however, are preoccupied with protest demonstrations against the government, and do not put the necessary manpower and resources into a proper investigation. A rivalry soon develops between the intuitive Park and the cerebral Seo. Park claims that he can detect a killer by simply looking into a suspect's eyes. Seo is more rational and scientific but both overlook crucial evidence and both do not hesitate to brutalize suspects. Although they force confessions from Baek Kwang-ho (Park No-shik), a retarded man, and a man who masturbates at the crime scene, they know that the confessions will not stand up in court. Showing signs of desperation, they torture an eyewitness to the murders to the point where he tries to escape and is run over by a passing train.Eventually the detectives locate a suspect who admits that he requested a song heard on the radio each night a murder has been committed, but not a shred of evidence is ever found. After they beat him, he tells the police, ""People know you torture innocent people.... You'll never victimize me."" Memories of Murder presents a powerfully haunting picture of a society so inured to violence and repression that a serial killer is a minor annoyance. As more strangled women are found, a sense of sadness and frustration begins to settle on the investigation and it becomes obvious that the police force is not prepared either by education or methodology to achieve results until the society it operates in can be purged of its authoritarian past."
"Echo many of the excellent reviews here - I didn't realise how much the film was a subtle criticism of the 80s dictatorship, though one murder takes place precisely because too many police have been sent to halt disturbances so that there aren't enough to protect the town hit by a series of sex killings. The first half-hour to hour is blackly comic, slightly farcical (forensic evidence destroyed by incompetence), but, for me, the film's greatness is when its tone changes - and the borders between the two leading detectives, Park, &, Suh, become blurred until Suh breaks down. The downbeat ending lingers in the mind, and its realistic portrayal of a desperate police investigation is head and shoulders above most Hollywood sensational crime pics."
"Memories of murder is a masterpiece.WOW! what a brilliant piece of film making!.The colors are filled with suspense and saturated with Korean attitude. I have seen a lot of movies about detective. Memory of murder is the best ever made.This definitely is one of my favorite film. The atmosphere create tension that keeps you at edge of the seat and keep you guessing.You want to understand this movie? You should know Korea history .This movie has many symbols,refer to﻿ dictatorship. This movie is based on a true serial murder case and they never caught the﻿ culprit. Between 1986 and 1991 ten women were murdered. There were nearly 3000 suspects questioned and 1.8 million police tried to find the murderer, but he has not been caught yet.I won't hesitate to give this a 10/10 rating. To be very honest, no other thriller impressed me this much.Surely Hollywood must learn lot from this Mesmerizing film.Each and every frame of this movie is important.Bye Hollywood, hello Korea.Almost best film in Korea﻿ right now so far.Trust me, you wouldn't wan't to miss this brilliantly acted, brilliantly paced, brilliantly shot, brilliantly written, brilliantly directed (etc.) BRILLIANT FILM. the BEST detective&thriller movie! And i﻿ really have to say the ending scene is once again, just beautiful.Highly Recommend."
"I gave the above heading for a reason. It was given due to concrete reasons, not for a catchy headline. I do not understand the Korean language, but the subtitles helped me a great deal. But what made understanding the movie easy was the acting and direction, which was fabulous. Especially towards the end of the film the viewer just have the same emotions of the police detectives and understands their emotions as well as the suspect. Normally in Hollywood films, the hero would be the detective. So he might be shown as a very cool as a cucumber sort of guy. But here we can feel their desperation. This is not a fast paced lots of action kind of film, but after watching the entire film, I must say I was touched by it and Mr. Bong Joon-ho, I am a fan of yours."
"I recorded this on the Sundance Channel and knew nothing about it. Wow! It was such a treat! The story started out kind of slow and satisfying ... reminded me of some Hong Kong police procedurals I have watched. But then this cop from the big city shows up (the murders are happening way out in the countryside), and we start to see a really interesting interaction among the cops (the city cop, two country cops, and their supervisor).If you like watching police try to solve a tough puzzle -- and people keep on being murdered, so the stakes are high -- this is an excellent film. I was a little surprised at how long it was, but the story kept shifting and I didn't feel bored. In fact, I was a little sorry when it ended."
"Just everything from the corrupt cops to the subtleties of the acting was top class believable stuff. I loved how corruption was shown not to work but yet at the same time you understood why cops get frustrated with the job. It would be interesting to know if the songs on the radio evidence was actually true because it seemed very credible as evidence for the factory workers guilt. This is unfortunately the reality of policing when often they don't catch the guy and it is frustrating and not at all satisfying for them or the viewers. I still remember The Pledge by Sean Penn. That left me more dissatisfied than this film and i suppose it was because this smart university trained cop was pushed to this frustrating point where violence was his only release. The conclusion was understanding how difficult it is and also why morally crime doesn't pay. The violent cop lost his foot, the one for kicking suspects. lol"
"A long film that grows stronger in its last hour. After some initial disappointment at what seemed a conventional city/rural conflict in police-work, I was surprised by the power of what emerges by the end-- enough so that I looked through the extended cast-interviews included on the domestic DVD. Someone who likes the film will be interested in the interview with the actor playing the second suspect: the film is apparently developed from a successful Seoul stageplay, in which he played all three suspects. Fragments of videotaped stage-performance shows him with very different affect-- and you realize the obsessive, haunted conclusion of the film indicates its open-case presence in South Korea's collective awareness."
"Eh, South Corean cinema... What cinematic art coming out of this backyard, small country. Recently I have seen several Corean films and I admired them all: the vengeance trilogy, Tae-Guk, Castaway on the Moon, and this one. All highly recommended. What shocked me most about this one is the ending, unlike anything u could expect from a Hollywood blockbuster. True, Se7en had an unexpected, bitter-sweet, emotional ending, not a happy one for sure, but this one is impossible for Hollywood, because here it all ends so true to life and reality, almost leaves u hanging there. The film is not only a brilliant crime drama, it also is a study of the changing South Corea and how rural life looked there 20 years ago. It also makes fun at the Asian kick-culture of violence and trying to solve problems this way, embodied by the detectives' third side-kick (oh the pun:)) and his fate. It also shows a piece of rural life that contains misery, loneliness, deviations. All washed in a sepia, gray-brownish colors of the Corean countryside. I think South Corean people can be proud of their film industry."
"I don't really need to see another serial killer movie but I'm inevitably drawn to look. Most are stupid, clichéd, and incredibly disappointing -- the obvious exceptions are the two classics: ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Seven"".The performances are superb. Rich, fully realized, fully human characters that are sometimes very faulted, sometimes funny, sometimes surprisingly heroic. The tech credits in this movie are uniformly excellent. The cinematography and editing are as good as anything you'll see.This is a first rate investigation that has plenty of twists and turns, red herrings, drama, suspense, and humor. But what sets this apart from most is its focus on the detectives -- their foibles, weaknesses, faults, and humanity.SPOILER ALERT: The key difference between this and most serial killer movies is that the killer is never found. But this movie is ultimately not about finding a killer. It is about the effect the investigation has on the detectives -- something we almost never see.A superb film. If you liked ""Seven"" don't miss this one!"
"Memories of murder is a beautiful thriller movie set in a very unusual setting, in a culturally distant country. It might well appear as the usual find-the-assassin movie that we see in rows every month on TV but it is not the case, absolutely. What set this movie apart and makes it a gem is the perfect psychological exploration of the characters and the astonishing poor means they have at disposal to reach the solution of the case, the distorted and terrible way to get information and confessions, the portrait of the distant and impotent countryside victim of its poverty and too far from political interest and from the eye of the media and the politicians who only seek scapegoats and not the real assassin because it's easier and at low cost, given that only poor farmers are involved and accused of the murders.A mind opening movie, very well directed and totally enticing till the last minute. A gem that must be seen."
"Sadly, this is loosely based on a true story, but the killer was finally caught a couple of weeks ago 33 years after the murders.Dark, gritty and humorous at times in a way only Korean film can pull off.If you're an avid fan of the serial killer genre this is an absolute must see."
"My Rating : 8/10You'll often see it listed in Top 5 Korean thrillers and rightfully so. The slow-pace, the performances and the dark cinematography make it an excellent moody atmospheric crime thriller.Highly recommended."
"Salinui chueok (2003), a little known South Korean crime-drama film, absolutely blew me away - as the title implies, the recollections from a job as mentally scarring as a detective can be difficult to forget. This story takes its time in developing its characters, tone and overall story and does so with an amazing amount of beauty, suspense and even a little bit of humour. The cinematography is gorgeous, the musical score is both poignant and haunting and the characters develop in such an honest and believable manner. It masterfully shows how the murders become so internalized by the detectives, to the point where rationality ceases to exist. These different character views are so intriguing and it's really what makes this one of the best character studies I've ever seen.Don't miss this minor cinematic masterpiece. It is in the smaller details where this film escapes formulaic development and becomes something so much more. Great stuff."
"Memories of Murder is based on the case of the first serial killer in South Korean history. Said murders took place in a town of Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province and attracted attention from the capital as well as from international sources. The movie naturally takes some liberties with the events in order to keep the story flowing, as it should, but it still means that it's a thriller with real weight behind it.The movie has garnered a lot of praise for its acting. Song Kang-ho playing the role of Park Doo-man, the local detective in charge of the investigations, won numerous awards for his performance, while I personally also really liked the performance by Kim Sang-kyung, playing the role of an investigator sent from Seoul to lend his expertise to the local police, who have never dealt with a case of such magnitude.The cinematography, directing and camera work have also gathered wide praise, and for a reason. The colours are vibrant and lush, the score it utilized with care, the camera angles are inventive and it's just a very nice film to follow visually.What keeps me from enjoying this film more is the fact that it's so stereotypically Korean. And don't get me wrong, I like Korean films and Korean style of filmmaking. But every other Korean film I've seen has been completely over the top and outlandish, with crazy stunts, characters and story lines. Normally that's the strength in those films, but imagine if that kind of style was utilized in a thriller based on a real life serial killer case. The movie lost me the first time a cop jump kicked a criminal. Granted, it's the most grounded Korean film I've ever seen, but I still felt detached from the story because I couldn't take it seriously.But, I can easily see how some might consider that an upside. So, let us simply say that while Memories of Murder might not be for every single thriller fan, it's still more than proficient enough for everyone to at least own it a chance."
"This is the first Korean movie I have seen and this is my first review in IMDb. This movie is based on true story that happened during 1986 in Korea about an unsolved murder. The movie starts off slowly and builds up as it progresses. The haunting music, the location, cinematography and finally the cast just keep you riveted to your seat till the end credits roll. The two lead characters, one a local detective who is just not intelligent enough and the other person who comes from Seoul are just magnificent and carry the movie. There are also some heart wrenching moments when one of the witnesses is crushed by a train and a rouge cop who uses his leg during investigation and then have to have his leg amputated. The lead up to the climax is just cinema at its best.Not to be missed if you are a thriller movie buff. This is how movies should be made. A first rate thriller/mystery movie. My vote 9/10"
"It gives me chills to write about this one. This movies has so much patience that it reminds me the golden '70s films from Hollywood. like The French Connection.It's kind of a buddy cop movie, but done right. It's also a period piece. The setup is so delicate, the payoff so cerebral yet it doesn't seem to compromise.Most memorable for me is a fantastic chase scene. What is memorable is how it came to be. But the chase is just as exciting..on foot no less .. at night no less.There's good acting from the 2 leads and there's a good (supposedly true) story. What more can you ask for?"
"This movie was recommended to me by a fellow screenwriter, and I was able to watch it online via Netflix. I thoroughly enjoyed it! It's a terrific look at the frustrations of police, when they don't have the evidence necessary to stop a killer in a small town.The movie is top notch, very well made, and Korea should be very proud of their film community.The array of characters are interesting and plausible. Great casting and acting in all roles.It's a completely believable yet complex plot. There was only one point where it felt formulaic and typical, but they pulled me back in immediately, and I forgave them for that one ""Oh, come on, now you're getting ridiculous,"" moment.The contrast between the local cop and the city cop, and the changes they both go through - excellent! The irony in the arcs these characters go through is rich.The ending is strong, especially the very last thing said. Provocative. This is a film that makes you think about many things for a long time after watching it.Very well done!"
"Set in 1986, ""Memories of Murder"" chronicles the first serial killer case in South Korean history. The victims are all beautiful young women whose bodies have been found raped and strangled in local fields and ditches. The initial agents who have been put on the case are two incompetent bunglers - one a dropout from college, the other a dropout from high school - who seem to have gleaned the majority of their investigative techniques from cheesy TV crime dramas. Enter Seo Tae-yoon, a forensic investigator from Seoul, who wrests control from the locals and brings some big-city know-how to the case.Given the grim subject matter at hand, it's amazing just how funny so much of this movie turns out to be. Blessed with a sly sardonic humor and a willingness to make fun of its characters even while evincing a great deal of affection for them, ""Memories of Murder"" plays less like a conventional cop movie and more like a regional comedy filled with rich insights into the subtle truths of human nature. The relationship between Seo, the investigator from Seoul, and Park Doo-man, the more rational of the two local officers, is intriguing and complex, as we watch them bicker and brawl and engage in petty power struggles, while slowly coming to realize that each has something of value to teach the other if only they can set aside their egos long enough to listen. Saddled with even-then antiquated technologies, Seo and Park are forced to rely on good old investigative footwork and informed intuition to try and solve the case.There are strong performances by one and all, and a fine sense of atmosphere in the setting. Those looking for a neatly tied-up resolution to the case may find themselves disappointed at movie's end. But the rich rewards of setting and character should be compensation enough."
"A well-made mystery based on a series of murders committed in Korea in 1986.The film has humor, suspense, action, and tragedy. The portrayal of police brutality of suspects might offend some viewers, but it's consistent with the known tactics that were practiced and tolerated at that time by South Korean law enforcement officers.Good acting by this fine Korean cast.This film and a few other recent ones show that South Korean film-makers are appealing to broader international audiences. Don't miss this one."
"I have seen this movie after recommendation from my friend. I like the mystery/suspense genre of movies, if anyone has seen the 'The Pledge' by Sean Penn where the main lead was played by legend Jack Nicholson then somewhere you will find the both story meets at some point in the movie. The actors are superb. The movie is all about the serial killer who kills womens on rainy day and whenever there is song 'Sad Letter'is played on radio. But nobody has clue who is the killer, the movie is bit over stretched,but the good thing is that the suspense remained through out. The detective from Seol joins the investigation and he is the one who actually do progress to find some facts which make this movie interesting to watch. But killer is too smart for them and the chase begins for nailing him.The problem about these kind of movies are that more and more short lived characters are introduced just to divert the curious viewer's interest to somebody else who actually has not killed anyone, but all evidence are found against him. Movie is superb and it retain the tension behind the complex characters and the relationship the detectives shared their anger,jealousy and competition are clear and understood well.The ending is also satisfying and it made sense because the case which is not solved ever in Korea is not manipulated into some strange ending.So friends what are you waiting for go and watch this movie and enjoy the suspense."
"Based on a real murder case in the 80s that now is now closed. It starts out almost as a comedy, the investigator is an amateur and resorts to tae kwondo kicks as soon as the suspects don't tell him what he want to. After a while it turns into a tense thriller.The Koreans really know how to make movies like these. Its well cast, especially the district investigator and Park He-il as the factory worker. Its well directed, and the turn in style is successful.Bong Joon-ho, being the director of the fantastic 'Flandersui Gae' made this, and since I heard a lot of praise for it I had big expectations. Only problem is that it had a few slow moments."
"A complete mess. Overlong, boring and offering no resolution, this film is more than bad; it's an embarrassment. That it's been so highly praised internationally is the kind of ""affirmative action"" pandering that occasionally strikes film festivals; it's success at home just confirms Koreans flock to bad movies too.The major responsibility of a director is to present a movie that is of a piece, that is, it is unified as a story in tone, time and place, and offers a believable and interesting plot. This movie is all over the place tonally: it has moments of madcap wannabe Jackie Chan-style buffoonery with Three Stooges-level relationships among the leads, offers serious policier pretensions for most its second half. As for running time: the whole thing is incredibly long, all the more so for a film that offers no real suspense, no threat to its protagonists and clues that come out of nowhere, like the female officer's sudden, out-of-the-blue discovery that a certain song is played whenever the murderer strikes. (And we're asked to believe that these cops are dimwitted enough to think that the murderer himself may have requested the song with a postcard that gives his accurate name and address!)It doesn't matter that the movie is built on a true case. So what? You don't go and make a movie about an unsolved crime unless it offers some other insight other than the banal idea that the serial killer-rapist could be anyone (which of course isn't true; we're not all killers). After slogging through an interminable running time, to then be offered no resolution (even after a meaningless flash-forward to ten or so years later) is an anticlimax of the worst kind. An absolute piece of total pretension with bungling characters and lousy story-telling (e.g., the retarded suspect obviously has been an eyewitness to a killing but the cops realize this two hours after you will), this movie may sour you for other, good Korean films. Don't let that happen."
"In 1986, in the province of Gyunggi, in South Korea, a second young and beautiful woman is found dead, raped and tied and gagged with her underwear. Detective Park Doo-Man (Kang-ho Song) and Detective Cho Yong-koo (Roe-ha Kim), two brutal and stupid local detectives without any technique, investigate the murder using brutality and torturing the suspects, without any practical result. The Detective Seo Tae-Yoon (Sang-kyung Kim) from Seul comes to the country to help the investigations and is convinced that a serial-killer is killing the women. When a third woman is found dead in the same ""modus-operandi"", the detectives find leads of the assassin.""Salinui chueok"" is a very realistic movie based on a true story. The performances are stunning, showing the flaws of a Third World police department in a country under dictatorship, without respect to the human rights, using torture to force the confession and without skilled agents and resources. Unfortunately the identity of the killer is not disclosed and the unsolved investigation gives a sensation that the films has not finished. I am really impressed with the excellent quality of South Korea cinema, with the movies that have been released in Brazil in the last years. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Memórias de um Assassino"" (""Memories of an Assassin"")"
"Belongs in my top ten list, never seen something like it before, better than se7en by ages, the direction is just super-fictionally amazing with music that will leave you breathless, and a plot that's complicated as the most professional maze, and the acting that so real that you would go looking for the characters in archives, it's a shame that a movie like this one is greatly underrated, this movie proves that the Korean film industry is gap-ply more amazing than any other film industry found anywhere else, film is not suitable for children at all, Stanley Kubrick wouldn't have been able to direct a movie like that in that way of perfection, Kwang-rim Kim and Sung Bo Shim wrote the most perfected plot i've ever seen so far"
It's been a while since I've seen this great murder mystery based on South Korea's only known serial killer but it was one hell of a movie.You've got your inept cops just looking to appease the scared public by finding any way and using any means to pin the murder of girls on a mentally slow guy who isn't smart enough to know he's being used and framed all the while a smart detective figures out the killer's modus operandi and tries to get the information to the cops but they are dismissive and plod on their own frustrated and angry path to finding the killer. But a break in the case is when the mentally slow person reveals he has seen the murder and is about to tell them who it is when all of a sudden....And I'll leave it at that.
"Bong Joon-Ho is a director that I knew a little about back in 2006 when I saw his wildly entertaining monster movie the Host. I had only seen that one film from him, but kept him in mind as someone good in the Korean film world (that is someone not Chanwook Park or Kim Ki-Duk). With this film, Memories of Murder, he's more than that now. As one goes through this tight murder mystery, based more on character and on the frustration of a clear pattern of a killer who makes it just a little too hard for the detectives to track down, you forget about the world around you or the time and just focus in on this story, of the grim line that delineates how to find a serial killer. Maybe it's because Joon-Ho knew that he was making a movie about the first ever serial killer in South Korea that he had to make it this way, about clash between inexperience and professionalism and right and wrong that's demonstrated here.It's not an action movie, but a character study, as non-conventional in its outcome or in its style as something like Fincher's films Se7en and Zodiac (for the former there's even so much as a specific shot and scene that is lovingly ripped-off, and the latter, well, just see the results of the case to know what I mean). It's the story of a series of rape/murders in a rural area of South Korea during a time of military dictatorship (watch out those 'citizen' alarms!), where women are being murdered and all in a pattern: wearing a red item of clothing, when it's raining, and when a specific and *sad* song is requested and played on the radio. While the local detectives Park Doo-Man and Cho Yong-koo try and shake down a confession out of a couple of suspects, one obviously mentally retarded, a seemingly hot-shot cop out of Seoul, Seo Tae-Yoon, comes in to help with the investigation and practically takes it over since he is, frankly, best at the job. This is not without some protest from the other detectives, of course, who feel threatened by their means of (nasty) interrogation to get a confession.One of the things that marks this as a departure from a lot of familiar serial killer mystery movies in America is the nature of the characters and how they relate to each other. Take the interrogation scenes early on: would you see in a typical movie an interrogation of a suspect where the suspect starts to go along with the detectives' premise just to get the hell out of the room? It's all about the details in the way the scenes are played out, how specifically and different Song and Kim play their roles, even as they're in the same profession and wanting the same end goal.Bong Joon-Ho also gives actors in small parts some fantastic scenes, such as the actor playing the mentally challenged man, or even the woman who somehow escaped the murderer's grasp but didn't see his face. And we get a real sense of these characters as having real conflicts and lives outside of this- sometimes with humor like Park's attempt to find a ""hairless man"" suspect at a sauna, or with some dark and violent ways like detective Cho who meets a nasty fate after a bar fight. Barely anyone is just two-dimensional, and even the main suspect-killer in the second half plays his blank-faced part perfectly.The characters all work, and the scenario is played out in a superior style (or if nothing else than with efficiency and a clear eye for details in the case arising naturally and without unnecessary melodrama), and on top of this the film looks gorgeous. Joon-Ho and his DP shoot and shoot away, getting some fantastic shots in these fields of the 'Boondocks' where the detectives find the bodies, or in the rain, or in a short burst in slow-motion that is just the right touch. A similar approach to artistry could be found in the Host, where an attention to light and dark and how to paint black and night scenes don't mare anything with the story itself. Particularly haunting is how he films the glimpses of the killer's-scenes-at-work, or in that masterful climax at the railroad tracks at the tunnel. By the end of the film, we don't know for sure if it's all entirely the truth and the whole truth (based on a true case), but it attains a hyper-reality that one can't shake off once it ends. It's a chilling tale that needs to be told, about the dire straits of breaking ground and not everything falling in to place."
"I am moved to comment after seeing references to the film ""Seven"". I found ""Memories of Murder"" to be as unlike ""Seven"" in style and form as ""Star Wars"" and ""Alphaville"" are different sci-fi films.Anyone should enjoy this movie because it is as well made as any film you have seen that you thought was great. Story, acting and filmcraft all are first rate and come together to show what life was like in South Korea in the mid 80's and weaves the story of of a small group of policemen and policewomen around and through that daily life. The portrayal of the cops is honest and brutal. They are as flawed as any of us are and do things they shouldn't. Their own frustration with the system is apparent as they take it out on suspects and each other. The Korea of the 80's is also fascinating as students riot and the whole population practices Civil Defense drills.The murders are dealt with almost entirely from the cops POV; that is, we see the aftermath and search for clues and evidence. There is plenty of frustration there as the cops we get to know can't get enough uniformed police to control crowds of gawkers and stop people destroying evidence by stepping on it as the murders continue.See this movie if you like detective stories, or murder mysteries or if you like true event dramatizations.But the main reason to see is it's just an all around good movie."
"This one got it all, beautiful camera work, a great plot, superb actors and an excellent story.This is eye candy, and mind candy! You get funny moment and suspense, thrilling moments and some gore! The only movie I can think of to rival this masterpiece is Joint security area (also starring Kang-ho Sung) and that's saying a lot.I had the chance to see it during a film festival in Sweden a few years ago, and I've watched it 3 times on DVD after that, and it gets even better the more I watch it. The film present you with a lot of gags together with several deep moments of sharing the pain of the victims. So don't just expect a heavy Asian flick, filled with understated emotions, try this and you will go on a roller coaster of emotions, from total happiness to complete sadness within a few minutes."
"A total knockout film. A piece of art which has everything one goes to cinema for. From funny to hilarious and then dramatic, emotional, sad and finally shocked. It's a movie without any ending and the one that attaches a hook to you brain and won't let it go. From the publicity posters to the editing, writing and acting this movie is a thoughtful work. At times it would seem like reading an old novel and at times it would seem like watching a nemesis film. There are many flavors which work because of the terrific acting jobs everyone has done. Every character is a perfect fit. Both of the lead cops are opposite to each other and then the shift in their personality to take each other's place. The suspense is very strongly kept through out the movie and there is a ground breaking background score to lift it to new heights. The chase seen from the woods into the village and then the factory site is very thrilling. Another scene involving the train accident is also placed right. There would not be any department or field this movie could be less then great at. Kang-ho Song, is the best thing in the movie. His portrayal of an aggressive cop is top notch. He brings all the humor and then the intensity in the movie. Sang-kyung Kim, also gave wonderful performance. A cop with less known background which is civilized and honest to his job and then loses his control over the event. A movie which will be on your favorite lift forever."
"Beginning of this movie and the ending are highlights. in the beginning, the child's innocence and the ruthless of the murder contrast and shock.the scenario is warm, with the sun shining, contrast to the cold scene later. then a woman was found killed, the other two women who were killed in the same way were found.Thanks to the foreign senior police, no one was blamed mistakenly by the local polices, one was utilitarian, the other one is violent and ignorant.There is not much description of the procedure of solution to the case, but the movie did highlight the hero , including his wisdom, his upright, his insistent, his kind and his responsibility. The movie also showed the irresponsibility of some policies that just want to close the case and play in dirty to condemn innocent people.Women were killed one by one, while there was still these policies to deal with this case, with no other policies responding to the request of support or may due to the limitation of the number of the policies. In the final scene, the hero's anger reflect people's anger that the murderer murdered many women and he may murder more while we can't do anything due to subjective or objective facts.The case wasn't close in the end ,while we can infer that the two polices may keep investigating if there is some trace of the murderer, because of their responsibility to be a policy."
"Korean films are just so remarkable and brilliant,I haven't seen one bad Korean film till date but memories of murder is just another level all together though as a woman I find the film sad and disturbing I cannot deny that it is one of the most intriguing film I have seen,it was so realistic and the acting and atmosphere they created was just splendid.Based on true case which happened in Korea and where they could never find the serial killer this film is a masterpiece from Korea though you need real guts to sit and watch the film.The acting,direction and story telling is engrossing and deserves special mention,loved the two chase scenes esp the one in the paddy fields was so damn scary.THe film creates all the thrill and scare with the atmosphere it creates like late evening darkness,rains,red dress it just send some chills down my spine.Hats off to the whole team of this film for making a memorable film."
"This is a film I would consider an art piece. There are few films that I consider legitimate works of art and this is one of them. The entire film felt like an expression of conscience rather than the usual film that creates falsified emotions and hogwash character development. This film was trying to express the confusion and frustration that a person feels when they border on unknown territory. The fact that this was based on a true story creates an atmosphere where the audience should stop questioning the plot, and start examining the human condition. Start to analyze what the film is trying to represent with the idea of being without fulfillment. The visceral frustration that comes out when you just don't have any answers.The cinematography is fairly standard, but it can be gorgeous at times. The characters are well developed. The acting is fine. All of the standard film criteria is met, but this film transcends the standard because of how thoroughly, and originally it examines the frustration of the unknown. I will definitely watch this again.9.7/10!!"
"A suspenseful crime drama, crafted with beautiful cinematography, wonderful direction and acting. It is almost void of the extreme and gratuitous violence we often see in Korean movies. The music is hauntingly beautiful and the setting plays as a silent character. Eerie, yet mesmerizing at the same time. Like the real life case, the circle of mystery is left incomplete and wanting. Although I'm glad the main characters reach a certain impasse and transformation. The karmic resonance that befell one of the detectives alone will serve you a cold justice up your spine. A really well made film that surpasses Zodiac on all accounts. . "
"This is one of the most interesting thrillers I have seen in quite a while. The acting is quite good ans especially authentic, the story of the murderer is gripping, the conditions at the time when the movie takes place are different, unusual and mostly based on intuition and courageous ideas so that this movie is easily distinguishable from other ones of the same kind. This is a psycho thriller that takes a look a the souls and feelings of its different characters and doesn't need any technical forensic analysis as it is a quite mature old school movie. This charm is underlined by some very brutal scenes and a lot of dark humour. One could easily describe this movie as an Asian film noir. You also learn a lot about Korea and about Asian culture in this unique movie as this is mostly based on true events. The ending of the movie might surely not please to some people but it is once again unusual and different from the mostly boring Hollywood stuff nowadays.The movie is highly entertaining as new possibilities and surprises arise throughout the whole story and create a complex and mysterious story. Maybe the characters are doing some mistakes in the movie (they don't realize that they have an important eyewitness until the end of the movie, they don't follow the hints of that disturbed witness and they are way too brutal with the different suspects) but this imperfect behaviour is somewhat the charm of those characters and the movie. The only reason why I didn't give the highest rating is that the movie was not always as suspenseful as I expected. This movie has a slow development and prefers to show us the conditions and the personalities of the movie rather than the fear of the victims and the pitiless brutality of the murderer and I think that a little mixture of both could have helped to not only create a very good movie but a true gripping masterpiece. Nevertheless, this is only a small detail and the movie is truly entertaining and original and wants to be authentic rather than being weird or shocking."
"Memories of Murder is set in a town/village in S Korea, and is based on the real events of a serial murderer, where a pair of detectives are working with (and even in conflict with) a detective brought from the capital Seoul to assist.The face of the serial murderer is unknown, and his executions of his kills are practically perfect leaving practically no trail leading to him. His victims, all females, are all brutally attacked, and one of the main emphasis of the movie plays strongly on the detectives condition and the impact that this is all having on them, as the strain and stress of not being able to crack the case weighs down on them.The murder hunt is very intriguing, but this is not your usual Saturday night detective program. If anything, this film is original with stunning camera work and scenery complemented by some great acting by all the characters. Storyline is not overbearing, and overall IMO it seems to walk the line well between acceptable and unacceptable with respect to violence and horror.This is another excellent film from the wonderful Korean stable. Not one many will have heard of, but if you get a chance I would definitely recommend it."
"This movie definitely caught me off guard. I had this movie lying around the house for a month and I finally managed to watch it. Man I wish I had seen this movie earlier.The plot is nothing special. Set in a rural area a killer kidnaps, rapes and then kills girls. The local police are having a tough time catching him so a detective from the city is assigned to the area to help them investigate the crime. You would think that this is a straight forward action packed crime thriller of a movie however this is far from it.I particularly like the fact that this film actually engages the audience with it's character development. For example, at the start of the movie we are introduced to a local cop Park Doo-Man (Kang-ho Song) who is portrayed almost as a street-wise smooth talking cop who use brutality to get what he wants. This image of him stays the same throughout the film until near the end. Whereas the detective from the city Seo Tae-Yoon played brilliantly by Sang-Kyung Kim is the opposite of Park Doo-Man. He prefers to do things with rationality, fair judgement and the usage of scientific methods rather than basing decisions on instincts and irrational thoughts which Park Doo-Man is best at doing. As the film progresses, the murderer continues to kill and the detectives are left with useless clues which lead them to another.And this is where the character development aspect of the movie really shines. After wandering around fruitlessly they become exhausted. Seo Tae Yoon who, originally was opposed to Park Doo-Man's brutal and vicious interrogation methods goes and says 'we just need to beat a confession out of him'. As an audience we can feel the detective's exhaustion and frustration and it just makes you eagerly wanting to know who the killer is.The whole setting itself, in a rural area adds to the tension and suspense. Technology is scarce, and in a period where protests and riots are occurring, you can't help but think that these detectives are on their own in this case. They have to use old methods to get what they want. The change in weather also adds to the suspense. When it is raining it creates a sense of feeling that the killer is about to strike which he inevitably does.The ending itself is what will tick most people off but not in a bad way. It certainly got to me but I should've known since it is based on a true story. I won't spoil it there for you however it should be obvious to you at the start of the movie.Overall this is Korean cinema at it's best. This film has some great comedy moments blend with great drama, tension and suspense. There are some disturbing scenes however that shouldn't put most viewers off. The whole film is shot beautifully with some scenes being gritty and others being peaceful. Its one of the best crime thriller I've seen in my life. I would certainly say its up there with Insomnia and Se7en. I wish to see more of these kind of movies in the future."
"It's been a while since I wrote a movie review, but so blown away was I by this masterpiece of moody suspense that I had to pen down something. I have seen only two Korean movies in my life so far and both have been among my favorites – this one and Oldboy. If that's not a sign to watch a few more of Korean cinema, I don't know what is.At its heart, the story is based on a real life incident in the 1980's in a small province in South Korea. A couple of women are found murdered - their corpses mutilated and their faces gagged with their underwear. It's a brutal crimes, the kinds of which has probably not been witnessed before in this sleepy town and the bumbling local detectives prove themselves hardly adept at apprehending the perpetrator. Crimes scenes are muddied over, evidence mishandles and suspects brought in on a whim to be tortured or otherwise brutally interrogated by the two cops put in charge. A third detective, who comes from Seoul, is assigned to help them and his evident disdain for the local cops' methods and his reasoning of this being in fact the work of a serial killer puts him initially on the wrong foot. However, when a third murder in similarly creepy circumstances is uncovered, the serial killer theory appears validated.That may seem like another cop movie on serial killers and their hunt, but it is anything but. The story is taken as merely a canvas to paint a wide tapestry of human emotion and character which focuses more on the internal demons which haunts each of these characters. The cinematography and music perfectly captures this mood – slow burning, understated, grime tinted and devastatingly effective. This is not a neatly wrapped up ready to order thriller. This is a movie where the cinematic techniques and writing are at their most superlative. The ending can be considered open ended, unsettling and maybe unsatisfying for some, but bear in mind – this was based on a true story, and this was never meant to be just about the case. A more popular movie which it brings to mind is David Fincher's underrated but very good movie, Zodiac, in terms of its similarities of theme and approach, but I would say this is still miles ahead of that little gem. This is brilliance painted on the canvas of our movie screen. One of the rare 10's I'm giving."
"A crime-thriller movie has never been this better I think. 'Memories of Murder' offers some elements that some kind of crime movies don't have. First hour of this movie moves quite slowly, many investigations and jokes in it which is enjoyable to see. It shows how real-life detective investigates, makes suspect confess and sometimes cheats the evidence if it's necessary. And last an hour of this movie is so tense and brilliant, especially near ending of it. Bong Joon Ho shows his genius idea by adapted an unsolved true story into a terrifying and memorable film, also combining with some jokes that makes 'Memories of Murder' not boring to watch. What makes it different from other detective movies are some unclear evidence doesn't always lead it to the killer, perhaps it's just an accidental or coincidence. For me, 'Memories of Murder' is one of the best crime movie ever created and the one that could be remembered for a long time."
"Any film chosen by Quentin Tarantino in his list of top films is a cause of celebration for the film's director as the metteur en scène would get the feeling of being accepted by a wider audience.However,by being a complete family entertainer,Bong Joon-Ho's film ""Memories of Murder"" outsmarts any move to include his film to any list.It is not so often that you see comedy, suspense and thriller in the same film.Bong Joon Ho achieves this feat with his wry sense of humor which is able to convince viewers to mock some of life's incongruities.His talent at revealing black humor comes in a hilarious scene which features a chief detective for whom nice shoes are as good as Nike shoes.It is often believed that the bad portrayal of women in South Korean films is heavily resented outside of South Korea too.However, positive portrayal of feminine characters in this film reveals itself as a redeeming quality.If one were to single out the most important element of this film, then it would emerge that the endless frustration faced by police forces when the crooked criminal positions himself a step ahead of detectives would take the large piece of cake.The film features nice performances by its leading men Song Kang-ho and Kim Sang-kyung.Film critic Lalit Rao watched this film at South Korean Embassy Cultural Centre,New Delhi."
"I won't hesitate to give this a 10/10 rating and a double thumps up because this movie truly deserves it. It was my second Korean movie (first one was Oldboy). To be very honest, no other thriller, be it English, Spanish, or any other language, impressed me this much. The movie started to make a different atmosphere around me from the very beginning and in the end, it took my breath away. I was speechless. Everything about the movie is perfect. Acting, direction, screenplay... the movie is full of life. A perfect blend for a stunning crime thriller. It is the best Korean movie & the best thriller I've ever seen. Highly recommended!"
"It doesn't have the theatrics of The Silence of the Lambs, or the eerie quality of Se7en. But what this film has is a concoction of humour, satire, suspense and characterisation that places it a league above those two great films. This film isn't your average serial killer drama, it has no Noirish quality, and the look is one of beauty and nostalgia. What I think it is, is more of a social commentary and a documentation of a real life event and South Korean politics in the 1980's. The film is highly original, the cinematography has deservedly been highly praised, the acting is top notch (and I wouldn't expect any less from Korean veterans like Song Kang-ho), but what really propels this film into movie masterpiece is the quality of the characters involved. Every character evolves with the story; these are very real three dimensional characters that offer no ""police thriller"" stereotype. Miami Vice these cops are not.South Korean cinema has been consistently one of the world's best this decade and with visionary filmmakers like Park Chan Wook and Bong Joon-ho. This is one of the best films of the past decade, and it's easy to see why Quentin Tarantino agrees with that sentiment. I couldn't recommend this film highly enough. It's breathtaking."
"I was lucky enough to check some discussion on Oldboy when many people were suggesting this movie is good. In fact its a lie, this is a masterpiece. I actually felt the local cop approach to being more comical, only after realizing it was a metaphor of the Korean Dictators who used similar approach to keep control of the people. The story based on a series of deaths at Gyunggi, in South Korea and the police department's individual handling the case. The initial supposedly random death becomes a thrilling game between the serial killer and the cops. The clues which they use to identify the misfortune involved in finding the result of each of the case is what really the core ideology of this masterpiece. The actors are uniformly brilliant , be it the chief investigator from the town, his mental sidekick, the inspector from Seoul and the chief. The various suspects add more mystery to the case than reveal it. The methods used for identifying the culprit are innovative and refreshing. I love the sound track, the classic ending and on the whole this special movie. If you love thrillers and don't have a problem reading subtitles then I can promise you will not be disappointed. For making a masterpiece this one gets 10/10."
"a film about the corrosive power of evil in destroying lives, not only the obvious ones but everyone who is remotely touched by it. And also a reflection on the ordinariness of the same evil. Don't miss it.I didn't get the political side, but, in a way , it also enabled to have a bigger picture of it. Also don't miss a Tale of Two sisters, A very good movie about guilt.Interesting enough the message doesn't interfere with the content, so this is a very suspenseful film, you can't take your eyes of it. Also Cat of nine Tails is one of the least inspired serial killers movies I've have ever seen, although I like director Dario Argento (less and less with the passing of time)."
"I don't want to point any fingers, or to suggest that a filmmaker like David Fincher would crib from another director, but if ZODIAC harks back to any other movie in the history of motion pictures, it's this one. The suspenseful stories unfold in likewise fashion; the trio of sleuths charged with finding and capturing the killer(s) in each movie go about their task(s) in three more or less individual ways; and the overall feel (not to mention the lack of resolution) is the same. There are, of course, cultural and philosophical differences between the two films, but there seem to me to be far more similarities than dissimilarities here. Had I seen this one before seeing ZODIAC, these similarities most definitely would've leapt out at me. Or you. If you found ZODIAC absorbing (or disturbing, or both), you'll find MEMORIES OF MURDER just as chilling."
"Two rural detectives, their chief & a well-educated Seoul detective search for a serial killer who specifically chooses certain victims when it rains, using their own undergarments to bound and strangle them while he rapes their tied up bodies. We watch as the rural detectives, who often use rough tactics to secure their admittance of guilt from those they question, try to find the killer and how the effected the city detective is when attempts to catch him often fail. We see their dogged, weary pursuit of suspects and the exhaustive, emotional let-down when each is ruled out by one way or another. When a possible suspect emerges, and seems the ideal candidate fitting the profile of the rapist who nearly murdered one living victim(..and also requested a specific song only on the nights the murders took place, not to mention the fact that he started working at a factory right before the murders), they believe that their misery might finally end as they await a DNA semen report from America possibly pinpointing him as the murderer. But, is this suspect the murderer, and better yet, can the rural detectives keep from exploding in anger when they interrogate the suspect? It'll all come to a head when the city detective looses his suspect after falling asleep on his watch and yet another young woman is horribly butchered in a much more heinous manner during one of the town's common blackouts..the detective will take his suspect to an isolated location claiming him guilty even though the American lab results may say otherwise.Powerful, haunting, gut-wrenching, & heartbreaking..we see how these men fail at their methods despite giving their heart and souls to the case day after day. Developed obsessions with possibly suspects even have the detectives at each others' throats. The film is quite absorbing as we see how each detective loses a bit of their humanity as they cripple at the leads that fail them or at an eyewitness who perishes accidentally during a horrible train accident. The Korean leads all bring much to their roles..during the film each character is fleshed out and exposed of their flaws at trying desperately to catch a killer against many odds such as unavailable forensic techniques or civilians trampling over crime scenes. Beautifully crafted by director Joon-ho Bong who adds many humorous bits sprinkled throughout so that the achingly tragic story will not be such a burden to sit through. Bong respects the victims by not dwelling on the murdered bodies too long."
"It's not hyperbole to claim that Korean cinema is the finest in the world, of course there may be hundreds of turkeys that are never seen in the West, but those films that do make it to our screens are almost always excellent. 'Memories of Murder' is no exception, a gripping mix of detection, character study and black humour. Based on a true story it involves the incompetent and under-resourced investigation of a serial murder spree in a rural Korean village. The script and acting are very good, the two mismatched Inspectors are both changed by their ordeal and the differences between them become blurred towards the end. No doubt the inevitable Hollywood remake is not too far away, what a depressing thought."
"Don't believe all those reviews that say ""the last scene will haunt you for ages"", it might as well not. If you're like me, you'll probably won't get any closure at the end, just sitting there with a ""was that it?"" face, wishing you wouldn't spend two hours of your life on something that dull and shallow.Comparing this to ""Seven"" is ridiculous. In ""Seven"", you had a gripping story, gory killings and a few ""holy sh.."" plot twists. This movie is a linear narrative about couple of stupid clueless cops running around in circles, randomly busting and torturing vulnerable people without any reason. Most of the traces go nowhere, most of the ""Chekhov's guns"" never fire.I didn't like ""Zodiac"", and I didn't like this movie. Looks like the writers of both just tried too much to recreate the ""actual events"", forgetting that the real life isn't so interesting to watch on the screen.Oh yeah, some good cinematography. But that's it."
"I don't' understand the reason why so much people rates this movie so high... to me it's just a quite nice story. Direction and interpretation are low-average. Some nice shots here and there. Pretty good photography. Nothing more. In some points I couldn't really follow the logic of the story, some characters look like complete idiots. There are some senseless dialogs (sometimes this happens in Asian movies) that displace you from the storyline. I understand that it's from a real story (i hate this kind of movies, because they must forcedly follow the events of the original story) but they could have done better anyway. Absolutely not an 8,1... I give 5 to lower the exaggerated current rating..."
"The first fifteen minutes or so seem kind of slapdash, with over-emphatic acting, undistinguished photography, and exposition that seems to be going nowhere. But if you make it over that bar, you'll find a police procedural with a good deal of personality and a more subtle story than you might have expected.It could easily have been a typical Hollywood serial murder movie. Maybe it still will be. It will star Brad Depp and Julia Theron and will sport a ten-billion dollar budget. Here, in its original form, we have a small-scale story of an unsolved case of serial murders in a small Korean town.Detective Park, a beefy guy with a big chin who is not too bright, investigates a murder. His partner is Detective Cho, even less bright and more impulsive. Soon another corpse turns up and Detective Seo arrives from Seoul, the big city. While the two rural cops are beating the bushes (and some suspects) looking for a solution, Seo intuits that a third murder has been committed, and he's right. The girls were all young, beautiful, wearing red clothes on a rainy night, and the killings were preceded by requests for a rare pop song at a radio station. I know. It all sounds a little familiar and maybe Dennis Hopper should turn up as the crazed murderer.There are quite a few comic scenes in the first half of the film as the cops bang their heads against the wall and follow false leads. They all go out to dinner with the dour Chief of Police. The intense Chief unexpectedly gets so drunk his head falls on the dinner table, but he wakes up when two of the others begin scuffling with one another. Then he vomits and brightens, claiming he's had an inspiration regarding the case. The drunken Detective Cho explains the difference between the Korean police and the American FBI in terms of geography. The FBI has to use brains because the country is so big that they must sit in one place and figure things out, whereas South Korea is the size of Cho's member and can be covered by detectives on foot in no time. Cho doesn't use the word ""member"". There's at least as much obscenity in this film as there will be in the Hollywood remake.By this time, I suspect, you'll be grabbed by the story and it gets more serious. And, I have to say, it's curious to see the law exercised in the Republic of Korea. A public announcement tells us that the president is about to make a visit and we expect bands, speeches, and cheers. What we see instead is a tank growling through the crowded streets and protesters throwing firecrackers and stones at it. The cops beat hell out of whomever they want. If a suspect is confessing on tape to a crime he knows nothing about, the cops don't mind giving him hints. ""Yes -- I strangled her! I strangled her with -- with -- (a cop cups a pair of imaginary breasts) -- with her BRASSIERE!"" They hang an obviously psychotic suspect by his heels and hold him for four days without charging him. On the other hand, only once does a gun appear in a cop's hand, and then in a context that defines it clearly as disapproved of.Things, unanticipated things, happen the way they do in real life. Detective Cho is taken off the case for police brutality, gets drunk, starts a brawl over some bul-kogi, and a bystander interferes by whacking him in the calf with a wooden board, but the board happens to have a rusty nail in it, and Cho winds up with tetanus. Seo, the big-city cop, falls asleep on a stakeout, an important suspect slips away, and another murder takes place.By the end of the movie, the corpses that have provided the occasions for smiles, have become the dead bodies of girls we've gotten to know a little about and it's no longer an occasion for amusement. A suspect is finally identified who looks like the real thing. A young man who operates a computer, handsome almost to the point of femininity, but the FBI's DNA analysis yields ambiguous results. I don't think I'll spoil the ending that, in its own quiet way, is memorable.Well worth seeing."
"This is one of the best Korean movies I have seen. The photography is equal to Janghwa, Hongryeon. It is amazing. Some shots are so perfect it makes your eyes hurt. The colors are filled with suspense and saturated with Korean attitude.It is a slow-paced movie with all the sub-parts you need for a great movie. I seldom sit on edge for over two hours watching a movie, but now I did. This is a great Korean movie; The Rain, local cops, great photo, cool attitudes, comedy, sadness, love, action.... It is simply put in class of ""Chan-wook Park"" and ""Ki-duk Kim"". There is suspense throughout the movie; a creeping feeling of frustration as the murders go on and no new evidence turns up. We, the audience, get to share their despair and impotence of the case. It's an haunting experience. I LOVED IT."
