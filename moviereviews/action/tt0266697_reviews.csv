"Having seen Tarantino's 3 previous films, going into the cinema, my expectations for 'Kill Bill' were already over the roof. However, regardless of my high hopes for quality entertainment, I was not prepared for this film. I was dumbfounded. I was blown away. I had quite simply never seen anything even remotely like it.In 'Kill Bill', the revenge plot serves only as a larger story arc, thus allowing Tarantino to play with as many different genres as he likes, and boy - what a mix he dishes out! With complete disregard for the conventions of filmmaking, he paints an expressionistic masterpiece in his own unique style, the likes of which the world has never seen before. Cinema rarely gets this exciting. With 'Kill Bill', Tarantino proved once and for all that all the hype around his persona is justified: he IS the most daring, original - and entertaining! - filmmaker of his generation. Simply amazing: 10 stars out of 10.Lesser-Known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget And B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/All-Time Favorite Films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/"
"Just saw Kill Bill: Vol. 1 and was surprised, to be honest, at how incredibly GOOD this film is. Here is a craftsman (or artist, if you prefer) at the top of his game. Some of the shots are simply incredible; the score is, for the most part, vintage Tarantino selections- and the RZA does a very good job at filling the blanks; Uma Thurman is a great female lead, for sheer presence (and decent acting chops). Even Lucy Liu, who I expected was going to re-hash her Charlie's Angel character, burst on the scene like a flaming nunchuck.The stringing together of the scenes was impeccable. The transitions, the intercutting between dialogue, the flashbacks... I simply could not get enough. Tarantino IS, indeed, having fun here. He is giving us a film that may not go down as a classic, Pulp Fiction style, but that shows us what is yet to come. I doubt that he's lost his writing talents (as some have claimed), and I actually disagree that the dialogue in the film is ""poor"", or that there are ""no memorable lines"" (Empire). The kung-fu genre has never been a particularly good park to display Shakespearean writing virtuosisms. The lines work fine. The plot is simple enough, but Tarantino takes a burger and serves it as ""steak tartare with sauce au poivre and asparagus terrine"". He basically manages to cram so much information into the film that plot is simply irrelevent. What is relevent is the Bride's thirst for blood, her primal sense of vengeance and our total devotion to her. Bill, of course, is one of the greatest characters to ever NOT appear on screen. Overall, a great movie and an example of how a filmmaker's tool is not his pen: it's his eye."
"This is movie is unusual, but it works for me. It kept me intrigued from the beginning with the plot which is not entirely clearly, but that made it more interesting for me. There's a lot of action in the movie which I found excellent and enjoyed a lot. It might not be realistic, but its a movie so it doesn't have to be. The plot is amazing and I can't wait to watch volume 2 soon because of how intriguing volume 1 was."
"A lot of people have come up to me and said ""How can you love Quentin that much, he is just too extreme!"" or ""Oh come on, Kill Bill is just SO not realistic.."" Yes. No.Mr. Quentin Tarantino is rather extreme, yes, and it's lovely! And No. Kill Bill is not realistic, but it's not meant to be realistic! Just like... Lord of the Rings, that's not realistic either! But because it has clear unreal elements, like wizards, it's acceptable?You don't go to see Kill Bill, or any other Q.T-film to see ""Stepmom"", in the same way you don't go to a Marilyn Manson concert hoping that they will play some Spice Girls..Kill Bill, both volume 1 and 2, is absolutely gorgeous! The art direction is beautiful! The camera angles are perfect... just Gorgeous! The lighting, the sound, the dialogs... and of course, the details! No one works with small details the way Quentin does. I must also say that the soundtrack is brilliant and the whole film is just so well casted! Uma Thurman is perfect in the leading role, Darryl Hannah has never been this good before, ever! And Chiaki Kuriyama, even though she has a quite small role, is excellent, even better than she is in ""Battle Royale"". David Carradine is painfully perfect, Michael Madsen is ALWAYS excellent, but never as good as when he works with Tarantino. I must also say that Sonny Chiba was great. I've never been a big fan of Vivica A Fox until now, and I used to think that Lucy Liu was just your average actor but she turned out to be fierce. Pretty much everyone who is in this film is ten times better than they've ever been.But above all things, Kill Bill is artistic, beautiful... Perfect colors, perfect everything... gotta love it."
"I know it's a couple years late, but I had to write a review for some of the few people that haven't seen one of my favorite and refreshing I've seen over the last few years. Kill Bill Vol. 1 is yet another quality film of Tarantino's short, but distinguished list.Kill Bill involves a nameless woman (Uma Thurman) who is slowing seeking revenge on her former hit squad the Viper Squad and her boss Bill (David Caradine.) Her former hit squad wronged her by gunning down her closest friends and family during her wedding and putting her into a coma while being pregnant. A few years later she awakens in a hospital, without child, and tries to track down each member of the squad. As the story progresses (through this film and the sequel), you find out who she really, why Bill wanted her dead and the fate of her daughter.The movie is really a combination of Tarantino's love for the 70's over-dramatized Kung-Fu movie era and story of revenge with rich dialog. Yes, this movie is violent, but in a cheesy way. This created some controversy and really had audiences stirred up, failing to realize it was supposed to be over the top without no sense of realism. Like I said, it was supposed to be a tribute more so than a gruesome action flick. With all cheesiness aside, I can understand how some people could feel a little woozy after seeing someone lose an arm and having 4 gallons of Kool-Aid red blood shoot out of the body like a whale's blow hole. What really makes this movie is Tarantino ability to make bad to mediocre actors seem like good ones, a smart and hilarious dialog and a good storyline. Of course, this is what he does in pretty much in all of his movies.There are various plot holes in the story, but we are really meant to ignore them unlike most movies. Just like the gory scenes, come to grips to the fact that the most of the implausibilities are there just to fill in the gaps of the movie. The movie also features a couple of classic Tarantino showdowns, including an unforgettable one with the Japanese infamous crime lord, O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Lui.) Once again, Tarantino puts his imagination at work again in his story telling by using some of his old techniques like jumping timelines and some new ones like adding Japanese animation for character backgrounds.I wouldn't really recommend this film to someone who is really not from the Pulp Fiction era. This film is really just homage to flicks that frequently appear on Sunday Samurai Showcase, revenge and Tarantino's continuous fascination with Uma Thurman. This film contains extreme violence and sometimes strange dialog coupled with some pretty good acting and directing. If you're not a fan of Tarantino's films, you should pass on this one because it is doesn't stray to far from his other stuff. If you like his other works, this is a must see due to its originality and quality. And, if you just don't like Tarantino himself, and find him annoying like everybody else, I don't blame you but it's still worth your while seeing."
"Man, what a film. As a fan of 70's martial arts movies, it was great to see all of the references. I also thought the use of B&W throughout was extremely effective. The cartoon sequences seemed a bit much, but did fit in with the overall feel of the film. I have seen many people posting about the sheer amount of blood and guts, but you have to remember this was Tarantino's homage to Bruce Lee-era action pictures. In those movies, the stories were very similar epics of revenge, and they never had much of a budget for good ""gore"" effects. It was more or less ""throw some fake blood on the guy who just got killed"" type of effects, which were duplicated accurately by some of the deaths in this movie. The plot also followed closely the plot of most 70's Kung Fu movies; something despicable happens to the weak hero (whole village razed, family slaughtered, etc..) and the hero goes away for years to learn the secrets of a particular style of Kung Fu. All of these movies contained the ""secret move"" which the master normally does not teach, except of course, in this rare instance. That move, as depicted in Kill Bill Vol. 2, is always used on the evil leader of the clan whom had brought death and chaos to the hero.Kill Bill was a terrific modern take on those movies which were always set in ancient China. I was very impressed with Uma Thurman's swordplay, at no point did I feel that it looked scripted or fake. Even when fighting against more than 50 Crazy 8's, it replicated admirably the incredibly one-sided fights from some of the best martial arts movies made 30 years ago.All in all, a great and original film! R."
"Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) is a unique film. I've never seen anything quite like it. My commentary for this film is almost all positive. First off, the cast really blew me away, each and every actor did a great job with their respective roles. Uma Thurman is a terrific actress and she was definitely the right choice to play the lead character. Thurman commands this role and you are transfixed by her in every scene she's in. It's not just the action sequences that she is great in, she's just perfect for the role all around. And it wasn't just her that I loved, I also liked Vivica A. Fox, Daryl Hannah, and Lucy Lui. They all showed off their acting chops here, especially Fox, I personally loved her short time she's in the film. The writing is well done, I especially enjoyed Thurman's dialogue, the well written dialogue and the impressive way that she delivers that dialogue all comes together to make something great. I think most movie goers will enjoy this acclaimed movie, as long as they're not too conservative that is. I say that because the violence is truly graphic and very bloody, but in a strange way it kinda works for this one. I'm usually not a big fan of that, but here it works. Good job Tarantino! 8/10."
"Sure it's outlandishly violent and bloody. Can anyone expect Tarantino's movie not to be a true mind-blowing, adrenaline-pumping shocker?  Of course not!  Gritty and slick, his first installment of KB rocks with moody western imagery, the '60s and '70s-era of Hong Kong martial arts-action, the influences of the ritualistic samurai swordsmanship, and Japanese anime. Like in all his films, Tarantino never fails to merge dark humor with terror. It's impossible not to smile over the Shaw Bros.' iconic introduction ploy and the De Palma-esque split screens. Observe the `Carrie' blank-starry eyed image settled on The Bride's gory face as she's introduced to the audience. Perhaps, Uma Thurman in her yellow suit is a salute to the yellow-suited Bruce Lee in his last film, The Game of Death. Or is The Bride 'Just another little Western girl playing at being a samurai' - as O-Ren Ishii blatantly puts it?This film's a sampling of the Tarantino 'fury,' short of the Tarantino customary fiery tongue. It celebrates the Tarantino trademark of avoiding the use of computer-generated CGI special effects. It's almost as if I'm watching a colorful and bloodied kabuki stage that's displaying a stunningly massive tournament of multi-layered kung-fu and female samura sword-fighting styles to dazzle the audience. It's examining how Tarantino catalogues the great stylistic elements of his favorite 'old-school' filmmakers and transforms them into a phenomenally creative and mesmerizing film. Yep, there's a great deal of captivatingly artistic boldness in this film. Powerfully portrayed and not to be easily forgotten. Violently brutal and gloriously gory without doubt, and yet so aesthetically operatic and astoundingly artful. The music and lyrics that accompany the scenes are astounding. They set the moods so appropriately with the events.
Even at 'The House Of Blue Leaves', we get to see Tarantino weaving the artistic styles of Lucio Fulci, Chang-Che, Sergio Leone, Kurosawa, Zhang Yimou and Busby Berkeley to bring the audience a stylistic exhibit of remarkable montage grandeur. The themes of betrayal and revenge come off strong. Every camera shot and scene seems to scream out, non-stop, `Kill Bill and all of Bill's DVAS members.'  My adrenaline's still flowing as I'm recalling the scenes. Tarantino has make a solid point with this film to show that martial arts scenes should stick to the artful and realistic choreographic treatment to sustain the true spiritual spirit of martial arts. A+"
"***MILD SPOILERS***What a dissappointment, especially after the awesome trailer.  I had several problems with this film:1)  I didn't care about any of the characters.  There was no introduction to any of them (apart from the super-violent anime section introducing Lucy Liu), so I did not understand or care about their  motivation.  Why was any of this happening?2)  It lacked the dark humour of Tarantino's earlier films, especially in terms of the sparkling character dialogue (e.g. Samuel L Jackson & John Travolta in Pulp Fiction), of which there was none.  The dark moments (e.g. the rapist hospital worker) were humour free and quite sickening.3)  Swapping the timelines around is an old Tarantino trick that worked brilliantly in Pulp Fiction, but added nothing to this movie except you knew the ending about 5 minutes into the film.4)  I got bored.  The final battle lasts forever and becomes dull after the first few people get their limbs removed.  The scenes where Uma Thurman convinces Sonny Chiba to make her a sword add nothing but minutes to the movie.Why wasn't it edited down and made into a single, complete, BETTER movie? So dissappointed."
"Do I think this movie is absolutely brilliant? Yes. Do I think this is the all time greatest movie ever, or even a top 50? Nope. I find the dichotomy between people who hate this movie and those that think it's the greatest film ever made is interesting. Even more interesting is the apparent split between fans of Volumes 1 and 2. Like the thread says, I think most of it's a matter of those who prefer style to substance. For my past, Volume 1 destroys Volume 2, but I concede that everyone has their own tastes and experiences and that no one pinion has any more weight than the other. Two scenes in particular really make this movie brilliant in my opinion, and both are fairly subtle in their portrayal but fascinating by their tone and the cinematic elements that come together to carry them off:1.) The scene where Oren and the Crazy 88 enter the House of the Blue Leaves. Absolutely magical. The score, the pacing, the atmosphere....simply magnificent. The slow motion pull away and the obvious hierarchy of characters, Lucy Liu was absolutely made for that part and that part was made for that scene. The beautiful and menacing Gogo Yubari and the goofy 88s trailing behind. You can also feel the tension the owners feel at having such esteemed guests but one's who admittedly exude as much fear as they do respect. Add to this the nameless, faceless people dancing who are oblivious to the regality (and lethality) of Oren's entourage. 2.) Oren is called out by Kiddo who subsequently whacks off Sophie's arm in a highly symbolic gesture. Words can't describe how moving that scene is. The score is superb and the timing is nothing short of perfect. I especially love the way the crowd pauses after the arm slicing...like they're all stunned or still convincing themselves it rally happened...then all rush out screaming. Kiddo makes a slow, deliberate plod through the panicked crowd, a march to destiny filmed from several perspectives that combine holistically to give the segment a life of it's own.One aspect of this movie that puzzles me is the emphasis it's critics make of the gore. For my part the gore was so outlandish it's hard for me to see how anyone could take it seriously, and that was part of the appeal. Buckets of blood spraying 15 feet in the air is so beyond the realm of reality how could you possibly take it seriously? For my part it was borderline comical and really brought out the flavor of the scenes, rather than being their focus. And regardless of what you think of Tarrentino as a director, the man is bar none the best at matching musical scores to a scene in the business. A few other noteworthy scenes...*The end-fight between Oren and Kiddo....marvelous stuff. The backdrop of the snow and the water, the smooth silence interrupted by the fountain, again, a great accompanying score. Fine piece of film craftsmanship.*Kiddo's overhead film shot while walking to the bathroom of the House of the Blue Leaves. Simply amazing. 5,6,7,8s performing live is just quirky yet proper enough to really add some depth and the unique filming make this a scene to behold."
"It has been six years since we have seen a movie from one of the world's most talked about directors, Quentin Tarantino, but the wait for me, has been worth the while. Tarantino can now add the martial arts masterpiece 'Kill Bill' to his resume, a film that left me speechless after I had seen it.  It certainly is one intense, hateful movie, containing some of the greatest sword fighting sequences ever filmed in a movie. Tarantino has made KB with class, precision and close intense attention to every detail. But, what else should we expect from a movie freak, like Quentin Tarantino?An entire wedding party is slaughtered during a dress rehearsal in a rural chapel: the pregnant woman in the blood-splattered wedding dress is Black Mamba, better known as 'The Bride'. The assassin, Bill, and his circle known as 'The Vipers' leave 'TB' for dead, however she was merely comatose. Four years later, 'TB' suddenly awakes from her coma, ferociously focused on one mission, to seek revenge on her former master. One by one, she will kill the various assassins. She is saving Bill for last.I am not sure where I want to start with my review of Kill Bill. I love parts of it, but then find other parts to be extremely difficult to watch. Quentin Tarantino has written and directed another powerful piece of cinema, in a way that only he could. This time we see more violence, the action and the result of that violence, with it being a bit over-powering in the end. But without the violence, KB would have not been the movie it was.This time Tarantino has not focussed on the dialogue in this movie, when it came to writing its script, more he wanted to show what the characters he had created, and why they were in the position they were in. For me I can appreciate both aspects of what Tarantino shows, as he can express himself either visually or with dialogue.The other part I like about KB is the way Tarantino dedicated the movie to certain aspects of cinema history. To quote Quentin he said Kill Bill is 'my yakuza movie, my samurai movie, my spaghetti western movie', and it was quite clear for me how passionate Tarantino was in showing these parts. However it was also so much more, with one of the great sections of the movie being presented in Japanese animation. I also believe that there was a clear reference to black and white movies and silent movies, as KB had these sections a few times. I also feel that Tarantino is in some way trying to show his appreciation to Pulp Fiction, the movie that made him successful, via KB. If this is true, I do not feel it is gloating, rather I give Tarantino great praise, because some movie makers ignore the movies that give them success, but not here.While 'KB' has some interesting characters, none are what I would call 'likeable'. 'The Bride', aka Black Mamba (Uma Thurman) is a girl totally driven by the desire to get revenge. Thurman really suits her part well, as she not only looks attractive, but is really believable as this American martial arts tough girl. Helping 'TB' on her quest is Samuri sword expert Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba). This character brings a very oriental feel to the movie, something I liked. The bickering with his assistant was fun to see being played out.'The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad' are the cruel callous people who inflict horrific harm on 'TB'. Bill (David Carradine) is their leader, a person we only hear and see in hand gestures, which is reminiscent of Marsellus Wallace in Pulp Fiction. Bill still has a very strong presence in the film, even though we never see him. Under Bill are killers like O-Ren Ishii, aka Cottonmouth (Lucy Liu), whose introduction, via the Japanese Animation, was great. Under Cottonmouth is her personal assistant, lawyer and translator, Sofie Fatale (Julie Dreyfus), who was present at the slaughtering of 'TB'. When 'TB' sees Sofie once again, she is pretty bitter about what Sofie let have happen to her. What we hear has happened to Sofie at the hands of 'TB', is truly unbelievable.Another of Cottonmouth's women is a little girl, Go Go Yubari (Chiaki Kuriyama), who is more deadly than she looks. Her school girl sound and look is very interesting, while her confrontation with 'TB' highly entertaining. Then there is the evil nurse, Elle Driver, aka Californian Mountain Snake (Daryl Hannah), who shows very little emotion towards 'TB', other than hate. Vernita Green (Vivica A Fox) is another woman that 'TB' has on her hit list. Her demise was highly entertaining to say the least, again reminiscent of Pulp Fiction.All the scenes with fighting in KB are a highlight for me, especially the sword fighting, as they are so fun and intense, with the last hour of the movie purely exhausting, with the final showdown between 'TB' and Cottonmouth & co. being terrific. The middle section of film was also great, as it tells the majority of the KB Vol. 1 story, although parts are pretty disturbing.Kill Bill is another film by Quentin Tarantino, where I have to say it was 'exceptionally well made'. There is a scene in Volume 1, which reminded me of 'Matrix Reloaded'. Now I have heard that Tarantino hates the Matrix franchise, and you can see what he is making a stand against, film's laden with SFX. KB is 'not guilty' of being that. The violence is very graphic in KB, but at certain times the violence was 'laughable', as it seemed to look deliberately fake. But perhaps I am wrong? Volume 1 ended at a good point, setting up the conclusion, Volume 2 beautifully. So Kill Bill: Volume 2, get here, A.S.A.P.CMRS gives 'Kill Bill: Volume 1': 4.5 (Very Good - Brilliant Film)"
"Probably Tarantino's most universal movie to date, with a little less character dependency than most of his films and a more linear approach than usual, Kill Bill Volume 1 is a great place to start for anyone new to his movies. I don't mean to imply this is a shallow film (far from it), i simply found it easier on the mind than Tarantino's other movies.Uma Thurman, left for dead by her ex-boyfriend (Bill) doesn't die and begins her quest for vengeance, by hunting down Bill's gang members in a search for Bill. Armed with a Samurai sword and a deadly blend of martial arts skills, Uma delivers action, violence and passion as she plays out the character with beautiful precision.Need i say, this is excellently directed, brilliantly scripted and cast, and should be in everyone's Tarantino collection.10/10 Second only to Pulp Fiction. Although it has wider appeal (I think)"
"I don't know what people like about this movie. Everyone told me to see it: the critics, my aunt and the kids I went with. However, I was in for a major surprise. The kids I was with didn't even enjoy the gratutious blood or the ""really cool"" ninja action. This type of movie (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon clone) is getting really old and I wish other moviegoers would start to agree. I really can't think of too much I liked about this movie other than one side character who was particularily interesting. However, she will not be enough reason to go to see part two (I have a feeling she'll make a comeback). Quentin Tarantino is just getting worse with every movie. As a 13 year old boy said tome as we walked out, ""It's like they were trying to be funny, but it really wasn't funny. It was just stupid."""
"`The fourth film by Quinton Tarantino', as the credits shamelessly explain, is yet another bankable classic from a director who's already changed the art with `Reservoir Dogs', `Pulp Fiction' and `Jackie Brown'.From `Kill Bill's first surprising gunshot to its monumental cliffhanger ending (right up there with `Luke, I am your father'),  the movie is relentlessly intense, tearing an audience between wanting more action and wanting a cigarette to calm frayed nerves. We follow the tale of `The Bride' (played to convincing, vengeful perfection by Uma Thurman) as she sets out to murder her former colleagues, members of the `Deadly Viper Assassination Squad', and their leader, the enigmatic, faceless Bill. After attempting to leave the group of assassins for a normal life, the Bride is tracked down on her wedding day and witnesses the murder of her wedding party, right before Bill puts her in a coma. Four years later, a very angry Bride wakes up.Tarantino pulls no punches, creating, as one critic put it, `The most violent film ever released by an American film distributor'. Squirting blood and flying limbs abound, but the director does it all with a breathtaking sense of style. We witness one sword-dance in silhouette, one in black and white, one over a beautifully filmed snow-covered Japanese garden, and even a sequence in Anime. `KB's story is minimal, but Tarantino's aim is style: Sergio Leone, Cheh Chang and Bruce Lee are all paid homage, and then gracefully outdone.The soundtrack, primarily Japanese artists performing American styles, is haunting: Tarantino breaks form by not using well-known American classic rock (who could forget being `Stuck in the Middle' of Mr. Blonde and a helpless cop?), but by doing so sets the perfect mood of the film. They're songs we've never heard before, but feel strangely connected to.Yes, the movie is in two volumes. However, the end feels right, coming after an epic battle that puts `Reloaded's `Burly Brawl' to shame. `Kill Bill' is a testament to Tarantino's ability to take the craft of his idols and make it his own, mixing classic cult film style and mixing it with his own wicked sense of Cool. Not for the faint of heart or anyone looking for a `feel-good' film, but `Kill Bill' is at the very least an instant classic."
"Well,ladies and gentlemen,it's a new millennium and Quentin Tarantino has got a new movie for us. After changing the popular film landscape in the 1990's with the classics ""Reservoir Dogs"",""Pulp Fiction"",and to a much lesser extent,""Jackie Brown"",Tarantino spent a half a decade in hibernation,accompanied by little more than a television set,a movie projector,and collection of Johnny Cash records and a bong. But now he is back after a six year hiatus with ""Kill Bill"",a thrill ride with the grand style of his earlier films and a brilliant tribute to those Shaw Brothers martial arts flicks of the 1970's and the action heroes of that same decade with includs Charles Bronson,Telly Savalas,Burt Reynolds,Clint Eastwood,Fred Williamson,Steve McQueen,Jim Brown and James Coburn. ""Kill Bill"" is also a chockablock of references to bygone movies like ""Master Of The Flying Guillotine"",""The Wu"",and the television shows like ""Hattori Hanzo"". This contains many of the elements that have made his earlier films so entertaining and he continues the tradition of that to.You have the wicked wit,the funky score,the hip-retro cultural artifacts and lots of non-stop,brace in your face action that is not to be missed. Also once again,he has divided the action into chapters with voiceover narrattion to boot,plus he's even got a new trick up his sleeve in which the story is told with some fancy Japanese anime. Basically the film gives much of the screen time to actress Uma Therman and she carries the film with the assurance of a golden diva that she is. The film rises and falls with her,and Thurman pulls that off beautifully in one of the best performances of the year. Thurman plays a professional assassin,attached to a criminal group of bodacious martial arts-trained killers(Vivica A. Fox,Daryl Hannah,and Lucy Liu)who are lead by the unseen,shadowy Bill(unseen in the first installment played by David Carradine). Among the crew she was called Black Mamba,but otherwise simply known as The Bride because she was betrayed on her wedding day when they gunned her down and left her and her near-term child for dead. But she gets her revenge against the ones that tried to kill her and from there the story is a thrill ride of sorts leading up to the next so expect the unexpected. However,a lot of body parts get slashed here and some of it is very gruesome includes scenes of decapitation of heads and a half a head,a leg in severely cut off and a Achilles Tendon gets slashed,a eye and some fingers get chopped off too. This film also has brought back some really good Kung-Fu stars from the 1970's which includes Sonny Chiba,aka ""The Street Fighter"",and so many more....... I'm surprised that martial arts actress Michelle Yeoh is not in this one. And by the way,what Quentin Tarantino movie wouldn't be correct without his main man Samuel L. Jackson in the role as The Organ Man. Jackson,however was in two Tarantino films including the role he should have gotten the Oscar for in ""Pulp Fiction"",which also starred Thurman and opposite Pam Grier in ""Jackie Brown"".However,the film ends in a cliffhanger so we will have to wait for the next installment which will be out in early 2004. Be forewarned,this not for the kiddies,so use caution when seeing it. In all,one hellva thrill ride."
"Gone is Tarantinos stylish dialogue. It's hard to believe the man that kept us entertained with a conversation about a cheeseburger is the same guy responsible for this.It's in desperate need of editing. There's so much that should have been cut, apart from the end fight the movie lacks pace and feels stretched. Talk about Miramax cashing in! :(Unfortunately unless you're in HK you will be watching a censored version which switches to B&W in the final fight as soon as the blood starts flowing. Thankfully fans should be able to pickup a R3 Uncut DVD.The only thing I did enjoy was the music, end fight (colour would have been nice!) and surprisingly (the part I was most sceptical about) the anime.
Save your money, its only half a movie and not a very good one at that."
"Spoiler Alert!!! I like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. The story line was strong in RD and less so in PF. PF, though, had interesting sub-plots that loosely wove together to make a good movie.I also see the genius in the dialog in RD and in the characters in Pulp Fiction. I was expecting to see something in this movie.Unfortunately, Kill Bill was not interesting, nor genius and did not have a plot. Basically, the main character was screwed over in a previous time in her life and made a top 5 hit-list of people from which to extract revenge.The way she extracts revenge is to engage in hand-to-hand or martial weapon on weapon combat. Of course, the protagonist wins the fights and the people are checked off the list.I think Luci Liu (sp?) is the 3rd person on the list. The movie goes into a 20 minute section on how she gets a Okinawan curved sword. Now armed with the best weapon, she takes on Liu's whole team of trained martial artists - and whips them all single handedly. I'm talking 20, 30, 40 individuals who all attack her at the same time in the same room. She still wins.Then, she battles the ""board leader"", and after sufficient scenery changes, she wins again.Each of these battles is full of graphic violence and blood, as you'd expect from the director (I won't try to spell his name). But, you can only show an arm getting lopped off and the resulting gieser of blood so many times. Wait, my mistake, you can show it for 2 hours if you are the movie Kill Bill.After the Liu's character is killed, #3 is checked off and the movie ends.There is no plot. The special effects and battle scenes were state of the art, but do not make a movie.I have no interest in ""Part 2"" because I have no interest in any of the characters or in more film about Uma killing people with swords. 2 hours was 1.5 hours too much.Two thumbs down. Don't believe the (if any) hype."
"If Tarantino is a genius, then I was a genius at age twelve.  With dialog like `silly rabbit, trix are for kids,' I don't understand why people fawn over this juvenile imbecile.  His `homages' are just blatant rip offs of movies that we've already seen .  Some of which, are so dumb that only Tarantino could be impressed by them. Kill Bill is just an idiotic excuse for teenage mentality violence.  How dare they call this excellent film making."
"*SPOILERS*First of all, let me warn you. I've always detested Tarantino, so I didnt'go see this film free of prejudice.That said, I can't think of a worse film I've seen lately, except ""The Matrix Reloaded"". The reason is that Tarantino shows too much violence, and that he doesn't show anything else. ""But that's the point!"" some will say. The point of what? Ok, lets' make a film and let's show a rape and say that that's the point. Does that mean that the film is good?Tarantino has always been overrated (I disliked ""Pulp Fiction"" as well). The reason is that he manages to feel unconventional and artsy, so many will feel smart by saying that he's a genius, that his films are masterpieces and all that crap. The plain truth is that he's either a sadistic voyeur or a cunning man who's found a way to make pots of money by exploiting people's naivety. Or both.Although I don't like gore or black humour, I sometimes appreciate it (eg some films with Vincent Price). The point is trivial, but worth making: black humour has to be, well, humorous. The problem with Tarantino is that he's nothing. A vacuum.Some reviewers have said that if you don't understand what this film is about, you just won't get it; that it's a mockery and so on. The problem is that if one treats himself to shallow, uninspired, unoriginal, uninventive films, who are shot chiefly for the purpose of using some glitzy special effects and for solvin someone's money problems for the rest of his life, you may find such a film creative or inspired, instead of just the trick it is.Tarantino is in quotations. He quotes all the time. But a film full of quotations and references is a trick that is worth doing once or twice. After that, it can't hide any more the outright lack of creativity that hides behind the references.If you watch a gory b-movie (or any b-movie, for that matter), you may like it, even love it, but you'd never go so far as to claim it's a work of ""art"". Tarantino is ""hip"" (for the time being), so it's fashionable to call this lame director a genius.But time will tell.Remember David Lynch."
"I hate this movie a lot. I have been going on about it for a while, so I think it's time to take my anger out by making a review. I think I may have offended some people, and I apologize. So, here it goes: ""Kill Bill"" is a very bad movie. I assume that Quentin Tarintino immediately drew in fans with ""Pulp Fiction,"" because of its wit and it was high on the ""cool"" factor. I saw some of it, and I will say that it was impressive. But, it looks like Tartintino became lazy by making this and co-directing the crappy ""Sin City.""The storyline of ""Kill Bill"" is about its name. Bill attacked a woman who we know as ""The Bride."" Her name is censored when mentioned. Now, ""The Bride"" wants revenge on Bill, and members of a gang called ""The Deadly Viper Assassin Squad."" So, she goes out and finds them and attacks them. The story ends there and it does well, sort of.The story is something that was thought up in a few minutes. The Bride wants to kill people, and she does. As simple as that. ""Kill Bill Volume One"" really is just shallow characters killing each other. First, she battles some woman. I have no clue what her name is though. Then, we find some history of The Bride. After, we find that The Bride was somehow knocked out. I forgot why. When she wakes up, we experience more brutal torture of people. Then, she gets a sword and kills lots of other people. The End.I find this very similar to ""Sin City."" It's a gory, shallow and pretentious action film that was made to show off a visual style and action scenes. The only real difference is that ""Sin City"" had something close to a storyline. This one didn't.Supposedly, this is Tarintino's homage to martial-arts films. So, that makes it a masterpiece? That makes it get onto the Top 250 Movies? Is that why it's rated so highly? It has plenty of references to other martial-arts films. For example, Uma Thurman wears a suit that looks similar to the suit worn by Bruce Lee in one of his previous films.Well, ""The Ring"" has loads of homages to horror films, including ""Rosemary's Baby,"" ""Silence of the Lambs,"" and ""Poltergeist."" Where's that on the Top 250 movies? Well, the homages seem as a cover-up for the story's' weakness. Why does a bodyguard fight in a skirt? I know people get attacked in a number of outfits, but since when does a bodyguard decide to fight in a schoolgirl outfit? The anime scene is near pointless, and doesn't even look like anime! It looks more like an attempt at drawing realistically, and ends up looking pretty ugly.Maybe it's because of the action. Well, there are only about two or three fight scenes, and they are only a bit exciting. There are plenty of other movies, which have better action. For example, ""Ultraviolet"" (Another bad movie) had more action than ""Kill Bill"" and a number of good fight scenes with good camera angles that gave it some flair. If that had homages to other films, would that be on the Top 250? I must say, even the action in ""The Karate Kid"" seemed to have a certain wit to it.All the action in ""Kill Bill"" is meaningless. It is meant to entertain. But, with loads of blood, what fun could it be? Its fun to watch The Bride slash her way through people, but after severed limbs appear, it loses it's fun. The violence in ""Saving Private Ryan"" and (I think) the violence in ""The Wild Bunch"" had purpose. But this, like ""Sin City,"" is just sick, cruel violence.With that, there are PLENTY of movies with good action such as ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"" ""Princess Monoke,"" ""House of Flying Daggers"" and ""The Quick and the Dead."" All of these had better storyline that ""Kill Bill"", even if ""The Quick and the Dead"" seemed a little weak in that department.Backing up to horror films, I see that this film plays out like a mix of ""Scream"" and ""Hellraiser: Bloodline."" One person repeatedly tortures victims (like Pinhead) with a blade. (Like ""Scream"") Sadly, it's not as thrilling as ""Scream."" It's as thrilling as ""Hellraiser: Bloodline."" The characters are thin. I'm not talking about thin, as in skinny, but lacking detail. Sure, ""The Bride"" gives a bit of inside info on them (The ""inside info"" is showing the character killing somebody else.) but the characters usually die after that.The action seems too unrealistic. Our main character kills plenty of people, but how? She jumps in the air and lands on her sword (It's stuck into the stairs.) but how does she do that? There are some movies with unrealistic action sequences (""House of Flying Daggers,"" ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"") but those take place in ancient China. This takes place in a modern day setting and doesn't feel like either one of those films.That's why I hate the film. I can go on and on, but why should I have to? I suppose I hate it for all these reasons. Maybe the hype killed it. Or, it could be because Dan Grant's review influenced me to hate it. Either way, I don't like it.Yet, there are some good points to this movie. The action can be fun for some. I don't think torture is necessary though. The music was excellent. I liked the ""Bang Bang"" and ""Twisted Nerve"" song. I suppose it does seem interesting at parts, like when it turns into anime (even if the scene seemed pointless) or black-and-white. (But, this was already used in MANY other movies.)But, it still stinks. To me, this is about as bad as ""Ultraviolet""; it's shallow and uses style to cover up its crappiness.2/10"
"Just goes to prove how moronic most present day movie-goers are. How anyone could give this a rating above 3 is totally beyond me. The movie is badly written and directed, end of story. The visuals are just a compendium of clichés stolen from countless other films. The plot is just any excuse for a bunch of over-the-top scenes of martial arts violence stolen from every bad 'B' martial arts film in existence. The only exception being the bad 'B' martial arts films are 50 times more entertaining than this overblown garbage-fest. And if I were Uma or Lucy or any of the other actors, I would be embarrassed to see my name on the credits. If you want to see a good film of this nature, see Peter Jackson's Dead Alive or Sam Raimi's Evil Dead. Those are at least fun, over-the-top violent films. The chances of my seeing part 2 after this are 0 to none. At least I didn't pay anything to see it, because that's what it was worth."
"When I saw Kill Bill for the first time I just fell in love with the film. Kill Bill is definitely a true masterpiece with a classic story about a brutal betrayal and an epic vendetta! Four years after taking a bullet in the head at her own wedding, The Bride emerges from a coma and decides it's time for payback...with a vengeance. Casting was excellent everyone did a fantastic job in their own place, Uma was the best and no other actress could of taken her place. My favourite member of the deadly viper squad is Elle driver the one with the eye patch I also liked the tune she was whistling in the hospital, I was wondering that how did she lose her eye which was explained in Vol 2. They never showed Bill's face in the film that kept the suspense for the sequel which was a terrific idea especially for me because I never knew what the actor looked like before. The two best scenes are: 1. The animated sequence because it was a different story from the film's which made a suitable mood for the perspective. Overall it is the best idea ever the other two films I've seen with animated sequences are Lola Rennt a German movie & Karam an Indian movie and both of them are my all time most favourite films as well as Kill Bill.2. The sword fight with the Crazy 88s just before her revenge with O-Ren-Ishi because it was so unexpected when hundreds of them jumped out of nowhere ready to fight. I thought it was going to be simple because Bill was the main target but it turned out to be more difficult.The main reason why it is one of my favourite is because I'm a huge fan of revenge movies and Kill Bill gives a very deep insight of the topic e.g. Like the Old Klingon Proverb on the screen before the film which is ""Revenge is a dish best served cold"" & when Hattori Hanzo said that ""Revenge is never a straight line. It's a forest and like a forest it's easy to lose your way...to get lost...to forget where you came in"". It definitely deserves to be on the IMDb top 250 and Vol 2 was also good but not better than Vol 1."
"Quentin Tarantino is certainly a cinephile's director. Many of the reviews that gut this film laud his abilities and his other works. An undeniably distinctive auteur, Tarantino is often criticized for self-indulgence, but that is what makes each of his works feel like a monument to a vision.""Kill Bill"" feels like a schoolboy's dream about an unstoppable protagonist who faces impossible odds. Take Bruce Lee's ""Enter the Dragon"", infuse it with the stylistic sensibilities of anime, and accent it with pop culture references, especially some strong musical numbers. The result is a personal saga that is the stuff of mythology.Uma Thurman is the nameless protagonist who virtually rises from the dead to seek a vengeance of desolation and mutilation. A perfect blade is fashioned for her mission, and it amplifies her lethality. Thurman gives a multi-leveled performance full of emotion and cold determination. She faces some strong adversaries and their minions, and she suffers through the terrible toll of her quest.Stylistically, KB plays with slo-mo, bold colors, silhouettes, and ""Crouching Tiger"" physics. Tarantino uses angles and viewpoints effortlessly.In one of the film's best moments, Thurman faces off against Lucy Liu, circling to the strains of Santa Esmerelda's introduction to ""Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood""---one of the greatest dance tracks of all time. In a less subtle scene, she takes to the dance floor in a break-dance killing frenzy to ""Nobody But Me"" by the Human Beinz.A major question for each viewer is: how much gore is too much? Tarantino never shies from depicting carnage and dismemberment. In fact, he glorifies it in this film which, for my sensibilities, is an unnecessary distraction and a tasteless extravagance. In one scene he creates a literal bloodbath (bath of blood). Consequently, this film is not for everyone."
"******Spoilers*****and a lot of them too****Since I am not a brainwashed cult follower of Quentin I was able to actually see the movie before rating it as the best thing ever made.
The first minutes were incredible, and I was having the time of my life. Opening scene in black and white bloodied Uma, then fade to black, melancholy music, fading out to perfection, suburbia (toys in yard, nice pretty house) then we have a funny as hell chick fight which is made all the better by a little kid that just stays there.. and says nothing. Basically the imagery is great and sets a mood. Then we have a flashback to the wedding, followed by a hospital scene giving some background of what just happened. And it ends. The moment you see black mamba telling her big toe to move while the camera repeats this a few times, you have a problem. The first thing you realize in the frames after we finally stop zooming on the toes, is that well, this is nothing more than a Charlie's Angels rip. Concept and idea. Ok there is still time for salvation right? Not really. Because then comes an anime scene that has no purpose at all, and unless you are an anime fan, it will simply suck. Lots of animated blood, still motion drawings and all other things we have seen in countless anime toons on cartoon network come to life. You can safely skip it, not like something valuable will occur. Which is the problem with this whole movie. It has no coherence. You can watch it at any point and not miss a thing. But it gets worse. Next on the murder list is the same girl we saw in the anime scene, and she is in Japan. So Black Mamba goes to Japan, and what follows for the other half of the movie is mindless kung fu that is bad, a lot of stupid time wasting moments of Japanese people speaking Japanese wise words, which are translated in annoying captions. Actually that would have been a nice touch, but they literally NEVER end. Japanese. Subtititles. More useless preaching. Wise men advice. Captions. Japanese. Captions. Repeat.
Although it is basically badly executed kung fu, even it suffers from some pretty obvious faults. Booze drinking schoolgirl uniform wearing underage female guard? Come on. And just to mention the tie wearing, sword swinging guards (samurai?) that just keep on coming. Please its a parody. A pathetic attempt to mix the infamous Japanese gangs of the 80s and 90s with ancient kung fu and traditions. At least that's the best I could make of it.
I am not going to guess what that movie was trying to be because it clearly had no point. It started great, it fell apart in about 2 minutes. Literally 2 minutes and that is even sadder. Save your time, watch the first thirty minutes, then go rent a real kung fu flick to fill in the rest."
"This movie is a visual experience of different styles, all combined with also some trademark Tarantino elements.The movie is obviously a case of style over substance. In essence the movie is just a basic revenge flick without too much depth or meaning. This however is exactly like how Tarantino intended it to be. ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" is simple, straightforward, completely over-the-top but above all beautifully shot and superbly directed. The movie its story comes totally secondary, as Tarantino used this movie as an experimental tool to mix several, mostly Asian cinema, styles together and blend it into one big visual experience of violence and unusual over-the-top looking sequences. His aim was style and with that this movie most certainly does not disappoint.Always when looking at a Tarantino movie, it becomes obviously that he's a big movie buff and movie lover. Tarantino really shows his love for- and pays homage to Asian cinema and especially anime. Most notably of course in the animated segment (that is great by the way) but also in almost every action/fight sequence in the movie and its violence. It gives the movie its own unique style and an overall atmosphere of 'coolness'.The violence is definitely brutal and straightforward, as gallons of blood are spilled in this movie. But all of the violence is done in such a, deliberately, over-the-top and fake looking way, that it becomes entertaining, rather than shocking or stomach turning. It even becomes poetically beautiful to watch at times. The action sequences are definitely the best parts of the movie and they are well choreographed and shot. When things get too graphic the movie simple conveniently switches to black & white or turns to other creative cinematic solutions.The power of this movie is definitely in its visual style and overall style of directing. The movie uses different themes throughout the movie but yet the movie manages to create one big unique identity. The movie never feels incoherent or disjointed in its style or storytelling, though it all widely differs from each other at times. I think that this is mainly thanks to Tarantino's directing, who keeps the movie and different styles all on one and the same line. Visually the movie is also definitely helped by Robert Richardson fantastic cinematography, who should at least had been rewarded with an Oscar nomination for it.The movie is filled with some big name actors, though not all play a significant part in the movie yet (see ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" for that). Uma Thurman is truly superb as the Bride and I can honestly say that this is her best role out of her career. She also was rewarded with a Golden Globe nomination for it. Also really superb in her role was Lucy Liu. Again, also her best role yet.Not of all the trademark Tarantino elements work out well in the movie I definitely missed the typical trademark Tarantino dialog in this movie and for also for most part the trademark non-linear storytelling felled pointless and didn't really served a purpose for the story. It therefor really isn't Tarantino's best but it's definitely his most experimental and most visually orientated, style-full, splendid movie.Unusual, over-the-top but strangely intriguing, entertaining and overall brilliant. Yet another Tarantino must-see!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"Before you jump to any conclusions after reading the title of my review, let me clear a couple things up. One, I usually love Tarantino--his directing, writing, the films he's produced, etc.--and two, the reason I didn't like Kill Bill Volume 1 had nothing to do with not liking the fight scenes or violence/gore. I love that stuff and that's the only part of the film that I found even mildly entertaining.Instead, the problem with Kill Bill Volume 1 is that it is extremely boring, almost completely lacks suspense, has awful pacing, and makes a number of self-indulgent stylistic missteps. I say ""almost completely lacks suspense"" only because of the first, relatively short section, where Uma Thurman's character, a former ""hitperson"", fights with another of the same kind, played by Vivica A. Fox. Suspense arises here because we don't know who the characters are yet, we don't know anything about the plot, we don't know what their motives are, etc. There is a sense of venturing into the unknown, where anything could happen.However, after this, Tarantino chooses to cling too tightly to his beloved device of non-sequential story construction, and the bulk of the film concerns Uma Thurman's attempt to take down a character whom we already know she has killed. That saps all of the tension from the rest of the film and makes it plod along as a fulfillment of something we're already aware of. It has all the drama of listening to your spouse tell _that_ story for the fiftieth time, this instantiation being filled with enough detail to take up an hour or two, and you're trying to read a book while they're telling it.Yes, Tarantino references tens of other films and genres in a ""homage"" that geeky fanboys can have a party game with--the one who names the most receives a free graphic novel and a case of Hawaiian Punch. Who cares? That in itself doesn't make Kill Bill a good story any more than a pointless clipfest of those films would make a good story. There is a reason that DVD's consisting only of promotional trailers aren't usually bestsellers.Yes, there are some interesting shots and intriguingly blocked scenes in Kill Bill. However, there aren't enough of them to make the film succeed if looked at merely as a series of images rather than a story.And yes, as I mentioned, I thought the over-the-top violence/gore was entertaining. If looked at isolated from its context, Quentin almost outdoes Sam Raimi ala Evil Dead here. However, and this is a big however due to having to consider context, Raimi's gallons of blood worked much better-because they were in an engaging, suspenseful story. In Kill Bill, the violence was almost boring.In an effort to be ""retro hip"", Tarantino includes a number of elements that blend with the film as seamlessly as President Bush in an Iraqi mosque. These are ubiquitous and varied, ranging from the stilted dialogue in the kitchen scene near the beginning (and this coming from someone who usually writes brilliant dialogue), to the strained inclusion of Sonny Chiba, to the ridiculous presence of a female Japanese band who can't sing or play their instruments--even though they're only trying to play I-IV-V ""rockabilly"" (and by the way, if this is what Tarantino think counts as quality music, what was he doing as a judge on American Idol?), to the almost obligatory occurrence of an anime scene. The latter is there just because Quentin and the fanboys think it's cool. For me, however, it underscores both the problem with most anime and with Kill Bill--yes, the subject matter, the violence, the attitude, etc. are interesting, but the animation, the storytelling, the pacing, and just about everything else sucks, and there are a number of inexplicable stylistic choices (such as the Caucasian-looking, big-eyed characters in anime). 'Forced' is probably the best way to describe the plethora of references and stylistic decisions in Kill Bill. Even the foot fetish stuff didn't work for me this time around, and I share the fetish with Tarantino. I'm not usually one to recommend tempering self-indulgence, and I suppose it doesn't matter anyway, since at this point people are going to love Tarantino films just because they're Tarantino, although if this film were made by anyone else, it would have earned the reputation of the 1998 Jeremiah Chechik-directed The Avengers instead. But if this is a sign of the quality to come, if Quentin is going to make further films that amount to laundry lists of all the stuff he likes _just because he likes it_, like a mega-budget mix-tape for a new girlfriend, I'm not watching any longer."
"I'm a fan of QT and much admire his earlier films, but sorry sports fans, Kill Bill is a tedious piece of junk. That Tarantino planned at one point to release both ""volumes"" as one three-hour film is astonishing. After the first hundred severed limbs, I couldn't stop yawning. With its inexorable cartoon violence; the predictable BS posturing of virtually every major character; and the obvious trajectory of its threadbare plot, Bill is technically flawless, emotionally antiseptic, and dramatically dormant. Clearly, QT has spent himself.  To be fair, Reservoir Dogs was a masterpiece; Pulp Fiction, audacious and brilliant...tick tock tick tock... Then Jackie Brown, a nice adaptation, but hardly earth shaking.  And now comes Bill, which owes everything to cheesy, grade-C, 1970s Japanese fight-flicks.  Buckets of blood and meat-grinding mayhem do not of themselves make for scintillating cinema.  The trick that eludes Tarantino is how to keep the viewers' attention while he attempts a hybrid of Seven Samauri and the World Wrestling Federation.  The sensual aspects alone should have been enough to sustain interest, but no.  Ultimately, Bill becomes an exercise in fever-pitched tedium.  Perfecting the cinematic equivalent of crap is hardly an achievement, no matter how well-crafted the montages."
I heard a lot of hype over the release of this movie.  The previews and commercials promised heavy kung-fu action in a charlies angels fashion. What I ended up with was a movie heavy on the vulgar language filled with short moments of violence for shock value only.  Other things that didn't sit too well were the cutting in an out of anime shorts.  Very annoying retro harmonica music and the fact that there will be more of these kill bill films coming.  I haven't seen such an over-hyped piece of garbage since Titanic.I'm sure this movie has its fan base but for hollywood to market it as a flashy chick martial arts flick is just wrong.
"This could have been a great movie if Quentin Tarantino had not directed. He really has no idea how to film martial arts scenes. (The second volume, which contains very little fighting, is terrific).One reviewer on IMDb wrote that a good martial arts scene makes you wish it would keep going on. For instance, you could watch 3 hours of one continuous Jackie Chan fight scene and never get tired. I would add that another quality is that is stimulates the little, imaginative, childish nerve in all of us and makes us want to do martial arts. This movie had neither quality. The fight scenes were embarrassing--I was cringing, waiting for them to end. They looked ugly and absurd.There was, however, some kind of strange, perverse beauty in how quickly the Bride could kill. Had Q.T. focused on that, he could have compressed this into about 20 minutes, and combined both movies. There was no real plot, and the dialogue was horrendous, so compression could only help.Not only were the fight scenes choreographed badly, they were filmed badly as well. The battle with the crazy 88s: Too many people on the screen, poor camera work, and then Q.T. makes it even harder to see whats going on with stupid tricks, like going black and white.An English professor of mine gave me some wise advice, saying ""A good artist knows what to leave out."" Too many things should have been left out because they had no point, and did not move the plot. For instance, the Bride sitting on airplanes and people driving places filmed in what I suppose was meant to be an ""artsy"" way added 20+ minutes to the film. When an artist indulges himself and not his audience, he insults his audience."
"That there are so many sheep out there whose goodwill towards Tarantino extends towards giving this film anything other than a firm thumbs down. What a mess. A genuinely embarrassing effort with terrible characters, wooden performances and no plot to speak of all covered up with glossy production design and ludicrous fight sequences. Most critics agree it is his worst film by a country mile.I am prepared that the whole thing should be redeemed by Kill Bill 2. But this on its own, Kill Bill 1 is rated so highly on IMDb that it makes the Top 250 above films such as Butch Cassidy, Life of Brian, Annie Hall to name just three. That is because there are a lot of complete idiots out there. Hopefully this will go towards redressing the balance"
"Against the advice of a couple people I generally trust, I saw Kill Bill this evening.  I thought it was a disaster.  I didn't find it hip, funny, cool, or anything remotely related. I've seen and mostly enjoyed QT's other films, so I can't begin to describe how disappointed I was--this is self-indulgent, overhyped crap, with no redeeming features.As a friend said, ""Despite what you may have read, it's not a tribute to kung fu movies, it's not clever, hip or slick - it's tedious, pointless and empty drivel."" I unfortunately could not agree more.  As Denis Leary's character says in ""Wag the Dog"" after seeing a reelect the President commercial, I feel insulted just having seen it."
"I saw the movie tonight (not by choice) and surprise surprise . it sucked! The last good film that QT made was pulp fiction.  IMO - I don't think QT is a bad director, but there's no depth and not much thought to his films. all he basically does is make a film look `cool"" and that's exactly what this film was! A total disappointment and no surprise there. Plus I think the guy is totally tasteless - he's a professional, he should know better than to talk trash on high-profile films just to bring attention to himself. sad sad sad!"
"So there is a lot of cult movie hype about how great Kill Bill is.....well, the first scene was just a shot of Uma Therman's incredibly beat up face which put a bad taste in my mouth. I gave it some time to get going, but all in all, this, even in its edited form, was such a violently grotesque movie, that I quickly decided it was not for me. I even had TiVo-ed Vol. 2 of the series, but if its anything like the first volume, I don't want anything to do with it. Sure there are plenty of violent movies, but this is just plain gross. So if you ask me, I wouldn't ever ever ever recommend it. I doubt there will be a cleaner version of it too, because it appears that the whole movie is going to be grossly violent. Who likes to look at Uma Therman, anyway? She freaks me out without portraying a white trash assassin in a movie.Of course I can see how this is very much a homage to the old-school 70's era martial arts movies, but I just cannot get past the blatant violence. I'm all for realism, but do I really need to know exactly what it is like to see hundreds of people killed all in different ways? The answer is no, thank you."
"Some people might like this! People who love watching arms & legs being cut and blood spread all over will love this... I really wonder how this movie is getting such high ratings.. Just because of producer & actress? I haven't seen a more serious trash in a very long time! I was so relieved when the movie finished! The first time in a long time I felt like asking for my money back.. Such a disgrace for filmmaking!I've read here some reviews saying that some people bash it because they do not understand it?! What is there to understand? And really how sick someone must be to enjoy a ""bloody master piece"" as you call it?"
"Uma Thurman is the avenging angel in this long-awaited fourth film from Quentin Tarantino. Intense gory martial arts action Crime boss O'Ren-Ishii (Liu) paces the gallery of the House Of Blue Leaves, watching her subordinates take on The Bride (Thurman), a samurai-sword wielding blonde dressed in a natty, blood-stained yellow tracksuit. As The Bride disembowels and decapitates a dozen yakuza flunkies, pausing only to rip out the eye of one assailant to uncork another plume of blood, one wonders: what does all this mean for feminism? The first volume of Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill sees women stalk one another as remorselessly as Sergio Leone's nameless gunfighters. Men hardly get a look in. The face of the titular Bill is concealed from us throughout. In place of machismo, we have a ferocious femininity - the snarl of a mother protecting her child. A different strain of aggression drives this action movie, maternal yet predatory. Tarantino riffs on this with his opening fight where the Bride and Vernita Green (Fox) break off from their knife duel when Green's daughter returns from school. The Bride is after vengeance. After taking a beating at the hands of her former colleagues from the The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, the final bullet to her head is delivered by Bill, who also happens to be father of the unborn child. Waking from a four-year long coma, the Bride clutches at her empty womb and unleashes a feral howl. It is a searing moment from Thurman, who showed up to work on the film only two months after giving birth. What does this mean for feminism? Hard to say, except perhaps that hell hath no fury like a heavily pregnant woman gunned down on her wedding day. A self-conscious interweaving of numerous exploitation genres - in this volume, the influence of Japanese samurai movies and the ultra violence of Takeshi Miike (Ichi The Killer) are particularly strong - unfortunately one also thinks of McG's Charlie's Angels films. Superficially, at least. What with all these kick-ass chicks and Lucy Liu strutting her stuff. In fact, Kill Bill is the anti-Charlie's Angels. It is a deliberate riposte to the cartoon kung fu, lukewarm Matrix leftovers, and shoddy CGI - what Tarantino dismisses as all that ""computer game bullshit"" - that Hollywood has been dallying with while the director was away. Where McG's franchise speeds you through its incompetence, Tarantino dawdles to shade in more characterisation, to fill in back story, to embellish every inch of the plot before marking it with a signature flourish. The director of the 90s is back and he might as well have signed the right hand corner of every frame.Unfortunately, he is so brimming with ideas and ambition that his film had to cut in two to meet the needs of distributors. Miramax took this course of action rather than edit their one-time wunderkind. An unsympathetic studio might have trimmed the extended anime sequence about O'Ren-Ishii's troubled childhood, for example, although this is an intense treat depicting events almost too agonizing and heartbreaking to witness in live action.Kill Bill arrives at a moment in mainstream movies - between the second and third Matrix films, before the final part of The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, ahead of another bloated Harry Potter installment - where Hollywood is willing to test the bladder strength and patience of its audience like never before. Whether it is the fashion for director's cuts or DVD deleted scenes, it is a contemporary truism that art is best served if the excised portions are restored. With this spirit in mind, the dividing of Tarantino's epic into two volumes may be seen as a victory for integrity. However, cynics may suggest that numerous installments mean punters shelling out more times for the same film, both in the cinemas and again for the various extended DVD editions. Whichever way you want to slice it, this is only half a film. Though it contains many pleasures - and it's great to see such an influential director returning with such a stylistically exuberant work - it is missing the classic satisfying element of any story: an ending. Verdict A blood-stained love letter to exploitation movies that seems to be missing a few pages."
"We have been waiting many years for this new Tarantino movie. It was better waiting more and get something else. How people could rate this mess 8.5? Unbelieveble. This movie seems a chinese movie from 35 years ago which has been remade using famous occidental actors. The plot is pretty cheap, banal and simple. The movie is monotonous and also a little beat boring. Based just on some sword duel (all identical) and that's it. It is not spectacular, too few crowd in the movie, nothing is new. The real vote for this movie should be 1 but, as other many times, the director of the cinematography helps the director to raise some vote more using nice games of colors and giving a nice look to a real useless filmband. I'll don't see for sure the next one (Kill Bill chapter 2). I already know that, after killing, in this one, 3 of her 5 ennemies, Mamba will kill the other 2 in the next one. Just one difference: the duel between Mamba an Bill will be longer. For that reason she killed 3 people in the first movie and just 2 in the second one. If you wanna waste 9$ and be scammed from this fake 8.5 go and gape."
"I fail to see what makes this so appealing. Way too over-the-top, bad screenplay. I didn't care what happened to any of these people, and the fights were not that mind-boggling. Some say that the Bride's battle with the Super 88 puts the Burly Brawl to shame, but that is simply not true. If you want a movie that does this kind of thing well, watch Crouching Tiger, because this movie blows. Dumb Dumb Dumb Dumb Dumb Dumb Dumb Dumb Dumb Dumb Dumb Dumb Dumb Dumb Dumb Dumb

"The past several years have been amazing for the film industry. Amazing in that never before in the history of the craft have so many highly financed and talented houses produced such incredible pieces of garbage. The only thing worse than this film is the fact that people are supporting it.The creation and success of this gratuitous rubbish masquerading as film is hard and disappointing proof that our nation is being overtaken by the stupid. Welcome to generation-perpleXed!Q.T.: seek help. Also, please don't reproduce. Same goes for the fans of this film.Fans of real film: Instead of spending your money here, donate it to genetic research. Maybe DNA scientists can unlock the 'stupid' gene and create a treatment which could be administered to the suffering at the next Q.T. showing.
ZERO of 10! Avoid!"
"Over the course of approx. 12 years, Tarantino has only done one thing: take other people's ideas, mash them together, and call it his own. This is no exception. In fact, it's the best example.Literally everything in this amalgam was taken (without permission) from another source. Plot points, dialogue, costumes, locations, music, even characters themselves were stolen and placed in this film. Like the movie all you want to, but it won't change the fact that this is perhaps the most unoriginal movie anybody has ever made.Some day (hopefully soon), Tarantino will steal from someone who doesn't want to be stolen from, and he will be sued for every penny in his unoriginal pockets. But as for the movie itself...what can I say about it that you can't see for yourself by watching other films? Nothing. Many many many people have caught on to what Tarantino has done over and over again since 1992, and many many many people really don't appreciate it.Keep this in mind if you decide to subject yourself to this horrible excuse for a film: the person who supposedly wrote pulp fiction actually wrote this. This is what that person is capable of. Someone by the name of Roger Avary wrote a vast majority (if not almost all) of pulp fiction...and True Romance...and Natural Born Killers...and perhaps even Reservoir Dogs. But it doesn't end there. In part two of kill bill, Tarantino even steals some more from Avary! It's no wonder why they aren't working together any more...and it's painfully obvious that Tarantino's movies are suffering because of it.So I have a challenge to anyone and everyone in the world: name one director, besides Tarantino, who has done nothing in their entire cinematic career except steal other people's work. Name one other director, living or dead, who has created nothing on their own. I'll bet my house that you can't."
"I caught Mr. Tarantino's latest piece at the Stockholm Film Festival and I was greatly disappointed, to put it mildly. This film is a piece of sh*t. There's just no two ways about it. It stinks.The characters are flatter than racoons on a highway, and the depth and development of the story is put to shame by most Italian operas. There is no trace of the intricate story building of Pulp Fiction, nor of the empathy for the characters sometimes found in Jackie Brown.All we get here is an endless orgy of über-cool nasty people in designer clothing cutting off feet on highly stylized stage sets, with fountaineous gushes of blood the high-point of the fun.The action scenes are tired, bleak copies only. They have already been done better in countless asian genre movies. Uma Thurman fights a large number of black-suited opponents at the same time? Well, wasn't that already done in Matrix II? It's not really funny the second time around, is it?There is no longer any originality in Tarantino's work. Everything is borrowed, everything is an hommage to something or other. But with no focus of its own, no vision to guide it along, the movie just disintegrates into a hodge-podge of stolen scenes and stolen ideas. Kill Bill just doesn't have a ""soul"". It is empty, void, a pointless excursion into excessive, stupid violence.With this movie, Tarantino has finally proven his critics right. Now, he really is just another panderer of speculative ultra violence."
"So many similarities between this QT movie and Sergio Leone's action films (once upon a time in the west; the good, the bad and the ugly). The storyline, the action, the soundtrack etc... There's nothing wrong in trying to imitate (or cover) a great classic, but what's wrong is the out-of-taste disgusting butchery and repulsive gore that prevails in this movie. It could have been as good (if not better) if the 'butchery' scenes have been made less explicit. For this reason I give Kill Bill a low rating."
"Arguably this should not be a difficult film to review. It is nothing less than brilliant. The story, the direction, the musical score, the casting, the acting, the dialog, the fight choreography, the inset homage to past films ... brilliant.Just brilliant.What makes this film tricky to review is not the film but ironically the film-maker.I do not know the deep background here but I am guessing that QT, at the very height of his creative powers, locked himself in a cabin in the woods for a month and put this opus together. And essentially (in the view of this reviewer) not only created one of the best films of all time but essentially defined his own career by setting a bar so high that even his own future work could not equal it.And there you have it. The hard part of the review.The film is perfection. But in my view QT has yet to produce anything that comes close either in terms of final product or even in terms of effort expended."
"Kill Bill is an extremely pointless movie.  Bad acting, bad editing, poor character development, some fight scenes were OK but nothing compared to Zatoichi films, old Jet Li films or even Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. It's empty, it's hollow and it's much worse than Jackie Brown.  The stylised violence is so ridiculous that the audience laughs at it.  What is this world coming to when people laugh when someone's head gets cut off? What is the point of all the violence anyway?  This movie is a sociopathic juvenile fantasy and there is no way that it came from the heart of an artist. I've heard several comments about how Kill Bill is an homage to kung fu and anime movies, and this may have been QT's intent. Unfortunately for him, it comes across as stereotyping and an insult to kung fu movies at best, and appropriation of voice and prejudicial at worse. Yes, Tarantino can put together a great soundtrack and a slick, stylized pa ckage, but this movie has zero substance.  If Kill Bill is the emperor, then he has no clothes, he is up there on the screen buck naked and boy is he ugly.  Don't believe the hype. And does anyone else get the feeling that vol 1 and 2 are just one movie cut in half so we can pay twice to see it?"
"Calvin: Isn't it strange that evolution would give us a sense of humor? It's weird that we have a physiological response to absurdity. We laugh at nonsense.Hobbes, walking away: I suppose if we couldn't laugh at things that don't make sense, we couldn't react to a lot of life.Calvin, now alone: I can't tell if that's funny or really scary.*There will be spoilers in here* Many audience members at the sneak preview screening of ""Kill Bill vol.1"" felt compelled to laugh a the absurd senselessness of this film. The movie seems to play as a spoof and I wished it was at times so that I could laugh along with the grotesque display of constant dismemberments, beheadings and occasional disembowelments I was watching.  However there is little comical about this film.  It decides to focus on things such as raping women in comas, a pre-teen girl killing a man while she's having sex with him, a little girl being dowsed in her mother's blood (and another little girl watching her mother die in a knife fight) as well as the good old 'sword chopping off the top of a head to expose brain' shot.  At least Tarantino didn't use the slowly falling apart body/head cliché.  A memorable laugh getter from the audience is from a women writhing in pain on the floor after her arm is severed.  She is seen in the background of numerous shots in a pool of her blood, much like Mr. Orange in `Reservoir Dogs'.  Nobody laughs at Mr. Orange's predicament because you feel for the character and the situation he's in, however the woman in `Kill Bill' got an awkward chuckle from the audience do to the nonsense that was being experienced.The movie is chocked full of horrific images that have no purpose but to move the numbingly simplistic plot towards the next gory visual explosion. And all without the witty dialogue that Tarantino's other films have possessed.I won't be recommending this film to anyone, and neither are the other five people I went to see it with."
"I'll admit being a die hard fan of Tarantino I had a somewhat blinkered view of what this film would be like. However, my obsession was not dissapointed.I'm not sure what effect Tarantino has on his girl friday Uma Thurman, but there is something dramatically different in her performances in his films than in any others. Thurman in this film is enigmatic from start to finish!The plot loosely is, although I am expecting more twists and turns in the second installment, that Uma Thurman is left for dead by her colleagues, a deadly group of assasins, working for somebody called Bill and Charlie's angels they aren't! Thurman is in a coma for four years, in which she supposedly looses her unborn child, and when she wakes up she is looking for revenge. She makes a list of these people and when she has killed them crosses them off her list.From the start to the finish this film shocks. And yes extreme violence is not that shocking these days as it is old hat, however, Tarantino does something a little bit more. It will sound very disturbing, but it is the creativity of the violence which makes it memorable. Like for instance the scene in the hospital when the man is about to rape the comatosed Thurman. As an audience we know that Thurman, anticipating the mans actions, will not just lay there and think of England, and will react with some sort of violence. However, I didn't think that she would tear his tongue off with her teeth.The film is Tarantino's usual hip and slick self. Whilst with all of his films there will be bitching about the violence. I think that the film in its self is so compelling and atmospheric, that the violence in a way blends in. Like with Resevoir Dogs, much was made about the scene of ear cutting. However, I wonder had Michael Marsden not been so compelling to watch as an actor and the song stuck in the middle with you wasn't playing in the background, would the scene have been so memorable.Speaking of acting, although Thurman has been mentioned, the ensemble cast were all very good too. I am especially looking forward the showdown with Daryl Hannah's character and Uma's.Although at first it took me a little while to adjust to not seeing Tarantino's trade mark hipper than hip gansters replaced by kung foo, I still could see Tarrantino all over this film, and although some may complain about the two part thing, it did what it set out to do, left me wanting more."
"I am a real movie fan whose two favorite movies are ""The Sand Pebbles"" and ""Flight of the Phoenix"" (the 1965 original, not the pathetic recent remake with Dennis Quaid trying to better Jimmy Stewart). I was excited when a friend gave me Kill Bill Vol. 1 and Kill Bill Vol. 2 on DVD for Christmas. Last night my SO and I watched Vol. 1. Or tried to. This is easily the most loathsome, gratuitously violent and sickening film I've ever tried, and the ONLY gift DVD I've shut off part way through.I don't know what compels anyone to make a film like this, nor makes otherwise intelligent people praise such a work. By the time we got to chapter 4 -- the animated segment in which a child watches her parents being slaughtered like animals by sadistic killers -- we had had it. By unanimous consent, we switched it off and put both DVDs in the trash.I can't truly express how horrid and disgusting is this film, devoid of any entertainment value except for the mentally ill. If you have not seen it, don't. If you have been given a DVD, pitch it. That this film has been honored says a lot about Hollywood, and none of what it says is flattering.Ugh!"
"I'm so glad that I didn't go to the cinema to see ""Kill Bill"". I mean, I should like Quentin Tarantino's films. I thought that ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Jackie Brown"" were superb and I sort of liked ""Pulp Fiction"". Tarantino hadn't done much for a while before ""Kill Bill"" so there was a high level of expectation before the film's release.What put me off the cinema release was the ""Volume One"" tag. I didn't want to pay to sit through a film that I wasn't going to like and that only took me halfway through the story. Now that the film has made it to TV in the UK, I'm disappointed to tell you that my suspicions were correct.Major problem: Kill Bill Filler - (1) The faux anime sequence that gives you the back story of Lucy Liu's character. Presumably the budget wouldn't stretch to having piece done by a real Japanese anime studio, so we get some American guy's version of what he thinks anime should look like. Wrong. Just to pile on the disappointment, it's predictable and pointless, a complete waste of screen time. (2) Tarantino also drags us back to the blood-drenched chapel too many times. OK, The Bride's been left for dead by a bunch of murderers, Quentin. We've got that. Can we move on please? (3) The Bride emerging from her coma, la la, drone drone, sexual perversion, violence, drag drag, shuffle shuffle, more violence, pimp my ride, drag drag, wiggle your toe, yawn, wake me up when it's over. I'm not sure how long all this filler guff goes on for but I knew that I'd been watching for ALMOST 2 HOURS OH GOD THE PAIN by the time the credits rolled.The action sequences are impressively staged but are too ""stagey"" to be exciting. In particular, the showdown with the Crazy 88 gang plays out like the climax of a TV Batman episode. The bride deals with wave upon wave of sword-wielding goons before reaching the ""Boss Level"" and despatching Lucy Liu's character in a couple of minutes. After watching a Japanese schoolgirl and the entire Tokyo Branch of the Reservoir Dogs Fan Club line up to get slaughtered, I was expecting something more interesting and involving. Tarantino's dialogue is well written and well observed, and he has a knack for creating fully-formed characters in short order. Unfortunately in ""Kill Bill"" he has eschewed the intelligent side of his film making skills in favour of crude splatter, pointless-endless violence and more cheap TV/film references than you can throw a katana at. This is what happens when you let a film geek loose with a big budget and carte-blanche. It's one of the few times that I've wished the Hollywood Suits had reined in a writer/director. ""Kill Bill""? More like ""Overkill, Bill"". You'll have to look elsewhere to see a good example of Quentin Tarantino's talent.Finally, there's the issue of the supposedly Star Trek Klingon proverb used in the opening titles. (A) ""Revenge is a dish which is best served cold"" is used in ""Star Trek II"" by Khan, a genetically-engineered human renegade, not by a Klingon. (B) the phrase ""La vengeance est un plat qui se mange froid"" was originally coined by Pierre Ambroise Francois Choderios de LaClos in his classic novel, ""Les Liasons Dangereuses"". If you're going to use an over-quoted phrase, Quentin, at least acknowledge the correct author."
"Before you can fairly review 'Kill Bill' please watch some true Asian cinema first. Such as: The Killer, Hard Boiled, Bullet in the Head, Shogun Asassin, Lone Wolf series, Ninja Scroll, Fist of the North Star, Crying Freeman, Blood, Invincible Shaolin, Master Killer, Legend of the Wolf, Five Deadly Venoms, Battle Royale and I don't recommend it, but the Guinea Pig series. Then, honestly see if you don't say Kill Bill is simply a poor copy of truly gritty cinema. Hell, QT even got Woo Ping, probably the best stunt choreographer of all time, thats why the fight scenes are so good, in essence he copied everything from the best of Asian cinema, except a good story. Liking Kill Bill is like liking frozen pizza, then one day going to Italy and tasting the real deal, big difference. I have seen all the movies I mentioned, and each surpasses Kill Bill in violence, story, choreography, or all three, people are heaping undue praise on QT. Real creativity is watching 'Hidden Fortress' then making 'Star Wars', but that was in a galaxy far,far, away. Hollywood nowadays is ""the asians have a movie called Ringu, I hear its scary"" ""well let's copy it for America"" ""Ringu 2?"" ""copy that too!"" ""Ju-on"" ""copy!!"", and the zombie moviegoers are none the wiser. Want to see an AMAZING movie? City Of God, its what QT wished he could have made. Some reviewers need to expand their viewing habits, there's a world of good movies out there. And if you can't read subtitles, there's always night school."
"Gone is Tarantinos stylish dialogue.  It's hard to believe the man that kept us entertained with a conversation about a cheeseburger is the same guy responsible for this.It's in desperate need of editing.  There's so much that should have been cut, apart from the end fight the movie lacks pace and feels stretched. Talk about Miramax cashing in! :(Unfortunately unless you're in HK you will be watching a censored version which switches to B&W in the final fight as soon as the blood starts flowing. Thankfully fans should be able to pickup a R3 Uncut DVD.The only thing I did enjoy was the music, end fight (colour would have been nice!) and surprisingly (the part I was most sceptical about) the anime.
Save your money, its only half a movie and not a very good one at that."
"Oh my! Tarantino really lost it this time. RESERVOIR DOGS was his only really good film in my book, PULP FICTION and JACKIE BROWN were enjoyable but rather derivative. Let's face it! If you know your b-movie history there is hardly anything original or challenging in an Tarantino movie. KILL BILL is even more annoying, as it is really boring and tame compared with the movies it rips of. Give me the original 70s Sonny Chiba films, anything by Chang Cheh or Lui Chia-Liang any day. Hell, even the Flying Guillotine. The SAMURAI FICTION sequence replacing the red background with simply a blue one was the most annoying one for me. I never believes Uma Thurman to be capable of the things she does in the movie. I won't bore you with all the plot holes this movie has. Unbelievably sloppy in any way. And the music (f*cking panflute music of Zamphir, get me the hell out of here!). This, my friends, is no labor of love, this is not even a good puzzle of hommages to other (more capable) filmmakers. And it's boring too, I nearly fell asleep. I can hardly wait to see something original again. I, for one, will not bother watching Vol.2 of this piece of rubbish. Avoid!"
"Frequently boring, extremely disjointed, and way too self-congratulatory. My biggest personal pet peeve was that it was very noncinematic in its heavy use of  voiceover narration, on-screen titles, and speechifying by characters. I like film to convey points of plot and character and mood and attitude through imagery and action... that's what the medium excels at, no? To have these points conveyed through narration and bad dialogue is inexcusable to me. As for the vaunted action sequences... yes, they are well done, but I found myself wanting to go home and watch all of a Leone western, or a early-70's Japanese pop-Samurai film, or ""Battle Royale,"" or one of my favorite HK action flicks, rather than Tarantino's far-too-short pastiches of same. I so desperately want this film to bomb at the box office. If this travesty spawns imitators, I'm packing it in and bidding farewell to multiplex cinema. On a positive note, Uma was enjoyable in the lead and Lucy Liu made a fine villainess. It was great to see Sonny Chiba on the big screen, also."
"This movie has no story, no character development, no reasonable dialogue and no intelligence. The plot is a weak and empty bus that serves no purpose other than to drive the movie from one fight scene to the next. What this movie does have: a blond-haired, blue eyed girl that wears this totally cool motorcycle suit and, like, totally kills 200 people, single-handedly, with one sword, Awesome!!!!! Doesn't take much to impress at the box office anymore."
"This film should come with a warning that it is only suited to those adults who never outgrew watching Batman on TV, and would like to see the same thing with swords. Despite its many pretensions - and a great opening scene - the ""movie"" immediately degenerates into nothing more than a cartoon. The ""acting"" ranges from pathetic down to non-existent, with Thurman on the top end. A lot of it is based on people reverentially pulling swords out of sheaths and then pushing them back in, and similar ripponese mummery. The special effects are right down there with the acting, with awful gaps between what Thurman, for example, does in FX and what she can do on her own.And what is it with this being Tarantino's fourth film? Perhaps he's aiming at Beethoven and Mozart status, and we can look forward to speaking in hushed voices of ""Tarantino's Fifth"". Oh, and we have ""The Making Of..."" titles too. What claptrap!Altogether, though many try to justify it as homage to this and that, or coo over its uniqueness, it is only a silly pastiche, thrown together in the expectation that enough people will be fooled into paying for it. It insults the viewer, especially viewers like myself who think Tarantino does have some talent. You wouldn't know it from this turkey. Don't waste your time on it."
"I know my opinion will be in minority. I think this movie is a speculation, a  movie which glorify violence. This movie is nothing else but a trip which worship violence. I wonder how this skinny uma thurman should be able to kill a whole Japanese mafia when the usa used 4 years to fight japan in the war, and then they needed a nuclear bomb to win it. So why did the usa use hundred of thousands of soldiers to win the war when they could have used some one like uma thurman. What did i get out of the movie besides seeing blood flooding in all directions?? nothing. It is nothing but glorifying of violence and mocking japanese people. I am not japanese but i felt this was mocking japanese people. I Will not see the second movie for sure. And by the way, this movie was not original.. just look at Matrix.."
"This movie is over rated. The soundtrack is terrible, the fights are poor and worse of all, the plot is linear. Tons of cliches, only the first 30 minutes has a few cool ideas.. Can't believe they will make a volume 2!! I love Gore & Kung-fu but Kill Bill is a bad attempt. Come on Tarantino, I know you can do a lot better than that."
"I might be mixing KB 1 and 2 below, sorry for that, it all blends together. Being no fan of Tarantino (except for Jackie Brown, end of the list), I could not say that there has been anything that specifically great about Kill Bill. The fight scenes are spectacular. Period. This is a movie in my eyes that tries to say ""hey, in case you do not like or understand me, you are just not at an appropriate level of evolution yet, okay?"". It is bloody, and illogical. This is often true for Tarantino's movies, I think (I did not like Pulp Fiction either and could not get through it once).Many have stated this before, but pray tell me, in case you wake up on your hospital bed after years of coma, how on Earth are you meant to grasp the whole situation immediately. And in the first place, why did they wait patiently for Uma Thurman's character to wake up? Did they assume they could chat it over in the end and be good friends again? The genre works with Asians - all-round, real, not imported Asians I mean- as in Wo hu cang long, but is in my opinion a total miss here. The same is true for the Anime part, which I found ridiculous and overdone. Why bother that much with Lucy Liu's character anyway? I do not believe there was much originality in this movie. The Charlie's Angels up against each other thing might have worked but did not. I suggest Tarantino and manga fans watch. Martial arts fans pick something decent instead."
"This movie was directed by that guy who likes to kill things. so he killed things. in Asia. so it's automatically cooler, right? oh and let's put in uma thurman. because we need a butch actress to make it big. over-budget and overused unimpressive special effects? check. no real dialogue? of course let's keep the mystery because we have asians and you can't communicate. samurai swords? cuz what's hotter(read: scarier) than an 8 ft amazon of a woman wielding a samurai sword. Lets abandon cinematic value for more fight scenes. GREAT IDEA!!! I can just see Quentin 'I want blood and chicks with swords, that's it' He is a genius. Undoubtedly. Because he knows that no matter how bad the actual movie is, geeks will flock in mass to hot chicks with weapons. Review written ignoring the opinions I hold that Uma is neither hot, nor Asian enough to wield a samurai sword."
"I've seen Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown and Pulp Fiction. There was a lot of blood and gore in these movies, but they had a story - something ""Kill Bill"" is totally lacking.I was rather appalled to see this movie so many people are mad about - and to see that it's nothing else but a meaningless bunch of fight scenes, full of blood and bad taste.Has Tarantino finally lost his mind? Violence for the sake of violence? No plot whatsoever? Fight scenes ten minutes long that make Matrix 2 look like Citizen Kane? What has happened that our society embraces a movie like this which has nothing to show but blood and chopped of arms and feet?"
"Quentin Tarantino has made some great movies, most of which are highly over rated. So this fits the bill perfectly, ho ho ho. Virtually every scene has the usual cheese soaked dialogue, the macho one liners, the stereotypical characters; including my favourite - the Japanese school girl assassin! Oh the sheer mundane, cheesy crap of it makes me want to hurl. I'm really not sure what Tarantino was on when he made this but it surely must have been hallucinogenic and must have caused brain damage. This movie sucked. The absolutely comic amount of severed limbs, heads and fountains of blood were like something out of a bad B movie horror from the mid 80s. Virtually every character has been lifted, no scratch that, STOLEN from anime movies. It's like a bad kung fu movie - oh wait it IS a bad kung fu movie.Do not watch this, it is a waste of your time. If you want to see a good Tarrantino movie do not look to this one, if you want to see a good anime movie do not go here, if you want to see a decent kung fu movie simply watch a Bruce Lee movie - since most of the ideas were blatantly taken from these things anyway.Now onto the 'quirky' direction in Kill Bill. First off - anime mixed in with real actors is not a new idea so that's one more idea that QT robbed. Then we get the oh so original 'black and white' moment where an entire fight scene, one which contained so many fountains of blood they should have been swimming at the end, suddenly losses colour then for no apparent reason comes back? I mean really Mr Tarantino what was the point? You used to make decent movies but frankly I think in this one you were just seeing how many dumb ideas you could put into a movie without people noticing. Do yourself a favour QT and go back to the drawing board. Mr Tarantino has proved himself far, far better than this and frankly it is a waste of a perfectly good budget to produce something this awful.So why did I give it a 3 and not a 0? Well there were a few good moments, the plot was relatively interesting, the soundtrack went from great to annoying and, lets face it, you've got to give it a couple of points simply for the sheer amount of blood and violence for no reason other than the director had got a load of fake blood on the cheap.If you like this movie you need your head examining since it is by far the worst movie I have seen all year."
"Possibly one of the most pointless, crass films it has ever been our misfortune to view. I say view but in fact we gave up half way through. We then flicked through the rest of the DVD and concluded it was more of the same and just gave up.Where is the justification for the graphic violence? Where is the quality acting? WHERE IS THE PLOT?At least if you watch a true martial arts film you know what to expect but this? This was just pure garbage and a waste of all the hot air about the film.There's a part 2 - somebody please save us!"
"What puzzles me is not the film itself, but the popularity such a piece of non-cinema has risen in this country and elsewhere. The very same plot was already very successfully approached in 1968, by Francois Truffaut, in his 'The Bride Wore Black'. The difference being that, at that time, there really was a story, there really was suspense, and whoever the characters, they all seemed human. In other words, they had FEELINGS. Tarantino seems so much hypnotized by style, that unless you're not a movie-freak, there is no way in which you can't keep on noticing references after references of a superficially exploited collection of stylish movements (mangas, comic strips, Samurai movies, pop culture, watered down atmospheres specific to such or such director, etc.)This time, his only apparent goal is how to overwhelm the viewer under a shower of violence and ox-blood No storyline whatsoever, no purpose, no way to identify ourselves with any of the characters, except for Bill's, the only one who seems to have some sort of emotions, and who incidentally is a psychopath (any contradiction here?)After viewing it, mostly in fast forward mode during those endless figures of sword combats, I asked myself what kind of irreconcilable trauma poor Quent must have suffered in his youth  And again, the targets of his spurs of most sadistic creativity are either women, gays, colored people, or figures of authority (I let you decide which belongs to which in his 3 previous movies). After having had to swallow the exhibitionist and sadistic stances of a New-Born Hollywood shark, here we are again, force-fed with hardly digestible matter and wondering what could be the next step Hard-core porn, real rapes, real mutilations (how much would an actor take to accept to have a limb actually severed in front of the camera?), feces, children's sacrifice??? Besides, the level of language - mostly sarcasms and insults  is in total contradiction with the argument of the movie that 'revenge is a dish that must be eaten cold', thus dispassionately. I really invite you to watch Truffaut's version and a real contribution to breaking taboos or at least, to allowing us to reflect on tricky matters such as vengeance.Sadly, Tarantino only talks about Tarantino, and about his obvious failure in processing his personal loads of hostility towards the world or God only knows what else. Pathetic and, even more dangerously, totally deprived of any sense of humor. To be discarded Quentin, you are perverting the very purpose of the 7th Art Will that be your last film? In the meanwhile, you are fired Next, please!"
"i'll make it short:the fight scenes are filmed quite good. problem i have with it is that uma thurman's swordplay by no means matches that of any asian martial arts actor. the only reason it looks kinda good is that they made a cut after each of uma's swing. it must have taken an eternity to film. the sword fights in hero or zaitoichi are far more impressive. heck, any asian martial arts movie will show you more impressive scenes. but they might have something this film doesn't have: a story!and that is my main gripe with this 'piece of art'. a 247 minute movie cannot consist of only a handful of action scenes with no story. it gets boring quickly. normally i don't have a problem with long movies, but kill bill's simple story would even be insufficient for a 70 minute movie, let alone a four hour movie!! it's ridiculous. a good movie (especially if it's in the top 100) must have a good story. only good action's not sufficient.but you have to be realistic and see what kill bill is: a remake of scenes from old action films and a minimal, bound together by a ridiculous plot, made up in 15 minutes. i can't see anything original in here, except for putting it all together in one (or two) movies. even the camera angles are 'borrowed'. same with music, story, scenes,...save yourself some time and money: don't watch it. watch the originals.."
"I was expecting a lot from this film, as a friend of mine told me it was good. But I should have known better as i often say to him I cant trust his judgments on films, as he is easily pleased. Bottom line is, this is a very average film at best, & only saved by the fact that some of the fight scenes are very fast & look the part, if tarentino had had a bit more money to put into the film it could have been a classic............wasted opportunity."
"I want two hours of my life back.  Tarantino set out to create a homage to those martial arts movies he watched as a clerk in a video store. Sadly, he succeeded.  This movie is plain and simply unwatchable.  It has the same badly and unbelievable action scenes, extremely corny dialogue, and an almost complete lack of plot. If this movie had been a foreign import, instead of coming from a cult filmmaker, it would be sitting collecting dust in the C section of your video store, probably right next to the pornos. The Matrix and the Run Lola Run movies were cool in that they mixed genres in truly original and entertaining ways.  Tarantino just makes a pathetic attempt at copying those films, trying to recover the aura of genious that he earned with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction and later lost with all his other films. There's plenty of gimmicks in this one to spare:  amputated limbs and decapitations that quickly become hilarious, anime thrown in for no reason, a final battle in black and white, and Tarantino's trademark of non-linear storytelling... take away that, and quite frankly, you will be left with not much more."
"We all know that Tarantino can do better, and has done much better. HE knows he doesn't have to bother, as people will watch his movies anyway.This movie is a 10 out of 10 for beauty and entertainment, but a 3 out of 10 for substance.6.5 out of 10"
"This movie is swill.  A linear, boring plot; weak, silly dialog; self-conscious, odd editing; poor acting--especially the poorly-cast Uma Thurman; and that's the good part. That remainder of this review, which I'll truncate in the interest of self-restraint, deals with the subject of this trash.  It appeals to the basest components of the culture that has been created by the visual media, exploits those ugly forces and allows QT to laugh all the way to the bank, which I am certain was his only purpose.  Fortunately, he's done such a poor job, proving once again that he's a two-and-out moviemaker, that he'll lose his butt on this garbage, ensuring that we needn't endure volume 2.At least I can hope."
"Watching this movie was a strange experience. i sat here getting more and more disgusted with the blood. (Yeesh Quentine, what's with the fire-hose-spew effect every time someone gets cut???) Admittedly, there WAS moments of style, but these are altogether smothered under a constant rain of blood and gore and a COMPLETE lack of a story line. My experience of this movie was one of ""waiting""...   i was waiting for the story to begin. What it ends up being is a mishmash of imagery. Some stylish, but all two dimensional. What ever happened to character developement??? i found myself rooting more for the SWORD buddy made, than for the blonde bimbo weilding it. One question i had for Quentine was this: Hey pal, if you went through all the trouble of making every scene with a wound in it so blatantly bloody, why not go for the hat-trick and have the cow getting killed in the end a fire-hose scene as well? Heck, all i saw was some hair flying and the bimbo dropping to the ground. Lame movie. If i could have given it a zero i might have except for some (VERY little) style."
"I went into this flick expecting more.  When I go to see a Tarantino film, I want to hear some witty meaningless dialogue.  When I saw this, all I got was meaningless revenge action.  Pure stupidity.  There are a number of arguments that this is Quentin's homage to kung-fu action flicks.  Advice: Go see any Bruce Lee flick where fists are used instead of swords, the fighting is less repetitive, and blood doesn't flow like Niagara Falls.  You will be saving some time."
"This has got to be the worst movie that I have seen. The story is jumbled with short segments of movie broken by carton segments. There is nothing to make this movie worth seeing, in fact it was bad enough that the entire group voted to leave after 50 minutes.The scene transitions are so poorly done I thought it could be done better as a school project."
"How did this make it into the top 250 list on the IMDb. It was a very disappointing film, and this comes from a Tarantino fan. Both reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction are classics of the highest order and rightfully Tarantino was recognised as a good director for these films. Yet because of the reputation he gained from these two films, anything he makes is branded a classic? Jackie Brown was OK, not great but entertaining. Kill Bill doesn't even match this. Its just a load of unrealistic cartoon violence, but is branded as excellent because Tarantino himself says it is (cos he gets off on this sort of thing). The plot is terrible compared to his earlier work. To me, Vol 1 is just Tarantino cashing in. The story of the Bride could be told with just Vol.2 as this is where most of the plot lies. Vol 1 is an excuse for all involved just to make more money. Vol.2 isn't much better, but with good performances from Michael Madsen and Daryll Hannah, its at least watchable. I hereby advise you to skip Vol.1 if you still intend to watch vol.2, as you wont miss anything important or remotely entertaining."
"A action/crime/thriller about a women named ""the Bride""(Uma Thurman) who was at one time a part of a group of world class female assassins until the leader of the group ""bill""(David Carradine) and the other assassins turn on her.They beat her up so bad she goes into a coma 4 1/2 years later she awakens from the coma and seeks the people who tried to kill her and her unborn child so she can kill them.Give me a break this is a very very stupid movie the story is ridiculous a total peace of vile crap.The gore in this movie is like no other movie I have ever seen they must have spent 2 million dollars on fake blood.It was almost sickening to watch the violence in this movie it makes ""fargo"" look like ""the lion king"".Uma Thurman's acting was absolutely dreadful.The screenplay was very bad also Quentin Tarantino tried to get clever with the directing but didn't quiet pull it off in my opinion.Best actor/actress-Lucy LiuTerrible,Vile,Disgusting,Movie-Jake HydenI rated this 2 out of 102/10"
"After I finishes this one, I am thinking: this movie is produced in Hollywood? And this movie is widely praised by the American audience? This is a joke! I see many bad movies. But rarely I can find something like this: conceptually stupid, action-wise naive, and even produced with a lot of hard work!!! It's not a comic-like action movie. It looks like this movie is produced when the director has never known how to make it. Avoid this. You will find nothing inside. No emotion, No action, No inspiration, No conversation. It's just somebody doing some scratch. (I really hate to say anything more about this junk. Just to condemn it and let you guys save sometime to get movies with more meanings or more actions or more entertainings. I hope this will fill up to 10 lines for my comments.)"
"It's certainly arousing to see a woman in a skintight motorsuit get smeared in sweat and blood and guts for hours on end and Tarantino certainly revels in the humiliation of his muse.The camera dwells with relish on her bruised and bloodied face as she pleads with Bill to spare her life, before she gets shot in the head. We share an intimate appraisal of Uma's potential as a comatose sex object. We partake in every painful fumble when Uma, her legs paralyzed and her nightgown drenched in blood, drags herself to safety.And it goes on and on and on: she gets buried alive, beats her fists into a bloody pulp trying to escape, then, covered in dirt, staggers across the road: a horrible mess of a woman, a mindless zombie. Funny, to be sure. But also something else.All throughout both films she gets shot, stabbed, slashed and thrown across rooms with such remarkable gusto, and she slams into walls and furniture with such satisfying thuds, that you start to wonder how the hell you're supposed to maintain an attitude of ironic detachment and cool appreciation of Tarantino's kitschy aesthetic.Underneath the stunning visuals, the beautiful choreography, and clever references, is the rousing lure of sadism and brutality. If only Tarantino would be honest about it, instead of coming up with a paper-thin ""strong woman"" motif to justify his indulgence.""Kill Bill"" is thrilling and pretty, but also dishonest and demeaning."
"The film is horrific. There's plenty of comments above that should convince you that this is a just plain bad film, almost unwatchable, but that's not what I want to talk about. What really concerned me was the messages that lay at the core of the film- I'll comment on a couple. The entire storyline is a glorification of sadomasochistic violence by and against women, usually of an either totally or heavily implied sexual nature. The film is absolutely riddled with it. Bill even says as much in the opening scene, while 'executing' the bride. It's no coincidence that the Bride holds hostage and mutilates another woman instead of the 88 male Yakuzas. When the Bride fights other women, both are usually portrayed as gratuitously enjoying the violence. Most horrifically, this is repeatedly extended to children. Who thought that a sixteen year old murderess being decapitated was a pleasant image? Or the image of her stabbing a man to death with the crushingly bad line 'now i have penetrated you'? The film actually praised the violence inherent in the plot- especially the murder of the mother in front of her daughter. Thurmann's performance was as a piece of drama unspeakably poor, it's fairly clear that all the above was intended to appeal exclusively in a sexual way to a male audience. The film runs like a bad and extremely disturbing porn movie, if that's what QT intended, he should have been more clear about it, and not disguised it as a real film. Almost as worrying in my mind is the portrayal of the Japanese culture that the film was intended to convey. Instead of focusing on the often stunningly beautiful, delicate and precise background setting- the true Japan- the film dredges up uninspiring wartime stereotypes. All the Japanese fall into one of two camps- a handful are portrayed in as near to a positive light as Kill Bill manages- like the Okinawan Sword smith or 'Charlie Brown'- but these are seen as weak willed cowards. The Sword maker is actually praised for giving up his renunciation of violence. By far the majority of the Japanese, however, are portrayed as sadistic, violent, bigoted, mindless, incompetent murderous thugs, with precious little differentiation between them. The most beautiful irony of all is that many of them are played as being racist!!!By the way, I'm a practitioner of Kendo, Japanese fencing. Whatever they were doing had NOTHING to do with martial arts. A sad reflection on Hollywood's cultural concepts; and a tragic corruption in the anti-violent philosophy of Kendo and other martial arts, and an unforgivable betrayal of the Japanese who participated in the film.Someone on IMDb commented that the film was comic. I had no idea that this was so until reading that comment."
"Fade inClankity clank, bang, bang, bang, swear, clank, ping, swear, twirl, swizzle, swear, pan in slow motion, clank, clank, clankity clank, clang, bang, frown, swear, bang, bang, BOOM! (Funky music with opening credits) Clankity clank, bang, bang, bang, swear, clank, ping, swear, twirl, swizzle, swear, pan in slow motion, clank, clank, clankity clank, clang, bang, frown, swear, bang, bang, BOOM, swear, swear, stare moodily into the distance, clang, band BOOM! Repeat repeat repeat repeat Fade out.And that, ladies and gentlemen, is it. To say that the Kill Bill lacks depth is a bit like saying that dogs lack table manners or the primordial swamp lacks a good opera company. To say that it's a bit tasteless and tacky is a bit like saying Californians need to sit voting exams.I fear Kill Bill proves only two things. Never assume that just because a man has made three great films he is not capable of something as crass as this. Secondly, never, ever listen to Uma Thurman when she says she has a great idea for a film. 3/10"
