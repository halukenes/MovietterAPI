"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.I didn't know man could build such things.Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10"
"Once again, Director Ridley Scott proves to be as professional as one can be. The recreation of ancient Rome is splendid, with all its magnificent buildings and atmosphere and he is able to show with all brightness the greatness of the Roman Empire, with its political problems and military discipline, and love and treason, of hate and jealousy, that still have a place in our world today. But the story has a glow of its own, to which all the beautiful scenery (believe me, it's awesome!!!) and great cinematography are just balancing factors. The plot is a rich one, that is as dynamic as it is present. He once again, after Blade Runner, 1492, and others helps us visit the depths of the human soul, which remains the same over all our historical and social experience. Even the fights, are displayed in such a way that all the blood is quite discrete, but still, making us feel like screaming and jumping out of our seats. I would also like to point out the performances of the cast, that is surprisingly good. We have some actors and actresses, who are not Hollywood icons, but are are greatly able to move the audience among screams and tears. All in all, we have guys like Russel Crowe, who are coming out to be part of a new and extremely promising harvest of people who are making each time more fans around the world. Well, you should see for yourself!"
"Gladiator, 2000's Best Picture winner, was undoubtedly one of the biggest successes of the decade. It made tons of box-office cash, nearly swept the Oscars, and revitalized the sword-and-sandals genre for years to come. Does the movie warrant the massive success it received? For the most part, yes. Ridley Scott's Roman blockbuster doesn't have quite the overwhelming emotion of another Oscar-winning epic, Braveheart, but as a brawny action spectacle, Gladiator soars. With a strong story, a profound sense of character, and action and special effects that are suitably exciting, Gladiator is a special kind of sword-and-sandals picture; One with a true dramatic core.Like the great epics of Hollywood's past, Gladiator is simple in its story. Russell Crowe stars as the Roman General, Maximus, whose life is thrown into chaos after the jealous Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) arranges for his execution. Maximus is sold into slavery where he meets Proximo, a former gladiator played by Oliver Reed who shepherds him through life as a gladiator as Commodus scrambles to stop Maximus' influence among the people. The story of Gladiator is a rock-solid tale of revenge, bolstered by well written characters, some sly political subtext, and a couple of stellar performances from Crowe and Phoenix. The two principle characters, Maximus and Commodus, are what separates Gladiator from the slew of sword-and-sandals epics that came after it. They are simply but elegantly written as characters; Maximus, a man singularly driven by a need to return to his family, Commodus, a confused young man singularly driven by a need to be loved. However, it is the performances from Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix that really elevate this material. Phoenix gives a brilliant portrait of an emotionally frustrated young man. He is completely unpredictable, but he never becomes campy. He is a real person with real problems, and there is an underlying sadness to his character that makes him so much more interesting than your typical stock villain. As for Crowe, his performance is all about physical presence. Apart from a few big emotional scenes, Crowe's performance is one of quiet masculine stoicism. He adds a remarkable gravitas to this character that all but makes the movie. You feel for him, you relate to him, you root for him, and you become inspired by him. It is a perfect heroic performance. The character stuff in Gladiator really works. Coming from a genre that made do with archetypal characters doing obligatory British accents for years, it is nothing short of a revelation that Gladiator is such a fulfilling dramatic experience. Here are characters you actually care about and not simply placeholders to string up the plot in between action scenes.When it comes to general filmmaking, Gladiator is rarely pedestrian and often astounding. Apart from some strange quirks in the filmmaking like the seemingly digitized zooms or the moments when the frame rate seems to cause a weird flicker effect, Gladiator is a deep, rich, and meticulously detailed visual experience. Hollywood production values don't get much higher than this. The technical departments are tops in terms of production design and costuming. The movie looks expensive, but there is something else in Gladiator's visual style that keeps your eyes glued to the screen. The look of the film, with its mix of traditional, large- scale sets and CG enhancements, is almost dreamlike. The environments of Ridley Scott's version of ancient Rome, including a painstakingly crafted digital recreation of the famous Colosseum, seem untethered to any kind of physical reality. It's as if what Scott has created is an environment that reflects the feeling of Ancient Rome rather than the reality of it. Just as with the deep characters and eloquent script, there's a modern feeling to Ridley Scott's filmmaking in Gladiator. The reliance on CGI is sometimes overdone, but in conjunction with the costumes, sets, and impressively grandiose score from Hans Zimmer, it adds to the intoxicating atmosphere of Ridley Scott's world.The main attraction of Gladiator is its scenes of gladiatorial combat, and on that front, Ridley Scott aptly gets the job done. There are a few moments when Scott falls back on to standard sword clashing and disorientating shaky cam, but for the most part, the action scenes are exciting, bloody, and imaginatively staged. The best action scenes are the opening Barbarian battle and a fantastic fight scene between Maximus, a veteran gladiator, and a Colosseum full of bloodthirsty tigers. In those scenes, Scott's emphasis on close-up, sweaty, brutal action is totally effective. I felt the cold of the forest mud, the heat of the flaming trees, the sharpness of the swords, and the dusty claustrophobia of the Arena. The action of Gladiator is visceral and bloody, and there is plenty of it. Those hungry for bloodsport will find more than enough manly derring-do to satiate their red-blooded desire.For all its dramatic depth, I can't say I came out of Gladiator heavily affected by feeling. This is still, at its core, a visceral experience, but the small character moments and the textured performances are miraculously riveting. I was intrigued by every second of Gladiator. The action scenes are thrilling, the dramatic scenes are mesmerizing, and the $103 million budget is all up there on the screen in every frame. Ridley Scott's direction is superlative, especially in the third act, as the story, action, and emotions reach a fever pitch. The last few scenes, including the climactic final showdown and the closing 'Elysium' scene, exhibit a crescendo of the kind of daring artistry that permeates the film's best sections. Gladiator is a meaty Hollywood epic of the best kind. It's visually sumptuous and supremely thrilling, but there is a beating heart within this beast. Sure there are a couple of bumps along the way, but with Crowe as the sturdy hero and a simple story of returning home, Gladiator stays with you long after the credits roll.92/100"
"Most films require that the viewer identifies with the character to truly be engrossed with the film. If you can't feel something for the character, than the audience is lost.Luckily, in Ridley Scott's case, Russel Crowe is so captivating and convincing as a general loved by his troops and as a slave loved by the people that the movie really works. Possibly one of the greatest actors today, Crowe carries this epic film on his very capable shoulders.Not to say that he is the only reason this works. The supporting cast, most notably Connie Neilsen, buoy the film to new perspectives.Jacquin Phoenix definitely captures the egotisitcal persona he should display, stealing every scene he's in. Phoenix will surely be put on the map with Gladiator.But the real shining star in this film are the incredible action sequences which jolt the viewer right in with the opening sequences, as Maximus' true worth to the Roman Empire is displayed. Scott's camera work within these completed sequences takes a modern twist that really works for the gruesome scenes.Crowe will now get the respect he deserves for this collosal performance. Gladiator makes the most of its 2 and a half hours, marking a triumphant comeback for the long forgotten epics of the classic days of film. ALL HAIL MAXIMUS!"
"Great Story!  Great Writing!  Great Acting!  Great Directing!  Great Score! This movie has it all.  I especially enjoyed the mood of the film.  Even though it has a lot of action, there is a subtle elegance throughout the picture that gives it great style.  The movie flows effortlessly from scene to scene, while at the same time creating wonderful intensity and nail-biting excitement.The acting in the movie more than lives up to expectations.  Russell Crowe is brilliant in his role as Maximus, the ""general who became a slave, who became a gladiator, who defied an emperor.""  Crowe's intense style is perfect for the relentless determination and confidence of Maximus.  Joaquin Phoenix is equally wonderful in his role as Commodus, the corrupt emperor. He plays a great villain because he is able to give Commodus depth by showing certain vulnerable or fragile sides, while at the same time instantly transforming to let the ruthless nature of his volatile character shine.  It also helps that Joaquin has the classic Caesar look that works perfectly with his role.Connie Nielsen is also very good as Lucilla.  However, perhaps the two finest performances in the movie were given by a couple of acting veterans in supporting roles.  Richard Harris and Oliver Reed were exceptional in what will be remembered as crowning achievements at the end of their careers.  Harris was perfect as Marcus Aurelius, the aging Caesar who reflects upon his life and contemplates how the world will remember him. And Reed, especially, gave my personal favorite performance in the movie as Proximo, the trainer for the gladiators.  The way he spoke about the life of a gladiator, the splendor of Rome, and the ""thrill of the Coliseum"" really added excitement and anticipation during the viewing of the movie.Gladiator is filled with many memorable moments that one would need to see more than once to fully appreciate.  The excitement felt for me when Rome is first shown in all its wonder and marvel is my favorite scene.  But the whole movie is a rush!  Hans Zimmer provides the absolute perfect score to capture the different moods in the movie.  Ridley Scott sets the perfect tone with his artistic and creative directing.  I would recommend it to anyone who can stomach intensity and enjoy an epic story for the ages.  Next to Braveheart, this movie is the greatest of all-time!"
"""Gladiator"" definitely is a classic film as it combines a simple, but moving, story with beautiful scenery, filming, direction and score  it is truly a ""complete"" movie.I am mostly compelled with the beautiful script which in a way reminds me of poetry, though it is still everyday language. I love the acting portrayed by the late Oliver Reed and also Richard Harris. Russell Crowe, Djimon Housou and Joaquin Phoenix are also superb and the parts suit them perfectly. There are also a number of less ""popular"" artists who also deserve a big ""bravo"". Amongst them I have to mention ex-Mr Universe Ralph Moeller who is mostly used as the comic relief of the movie. In Gladiator we can also the beautiful and popular Maltese TV Star and actress Ruth Frendo, who although has a small part, she is totally brilliant and outstanding.Actually I got to IMDb while I was looking for her name on the internet, in fact on IMDb she has some very stunning photos. I was lucky to meet Ruth Frendo whilst she was filming in another Maltese production. Ruth Frendo is not only a gorgeous and talented actress but she is also amazingly intelligent and very down-to-earth. We will definitely be seeing more of her work in the future... The scenery used for ""Gladiator"" is brilliant  and the opening battle scene is definitely one of my top favorite scenes. The modern camera technique contrasts sharply to the brutality of the gladiators actions and blood shed during the movie; and I love the light contrasts thanks to the lenses which most definitely have been used to create a surreal feel to the entire movie.""Gladiator"" deserves all the awards and great reviews it has received, and for those of you who still haven't gone and watched it  I can assure you that it will be well worth your time and money. So go on and rent it now!"
Seriously the best fantasy film of the modern area with great acting and emotional rollercoastering all the way through. The soundtrack by Zimmer really propels this film
"The epic blockbuster returns with the 21st Century's answer to Cecil B DeMille, Ridley Scott and his dramatic tale of courage and revenge, GLADIATOR - ""the general who became a slave, the slave who became a gladiator, the gladiator who defied an emperor"".Once a great roman General, and as good as adopted son of Marcus Aurelius Caesar (Harris), Maximus (Crowe) is forced into exile by Commodus (Phoenix), heir to the throne, after the death of Marcus. Saved from death by slavers, he is purchased for use as a gladiator by Proximo (Reed) and ends up in the arena of all arena's, the Colloseum, where he proves unbeatable under his guise as ""The Spaniard"".And with a budget of over $100m, Scott certainly delivers the goods. GLADIATOR transcends the notion of 'blockbuster' that we have become accustomed to in the age of electronic and special effects wizardry and instead offers a good old fashioned action film along the lines of Spartacus and and Ben Hur. Not only are we drawn into an archetypal story that contains all the classic elements a filmgoer could dream of (love, loss, courage, despair, good triumphing over evil etc etc) - also on offer is a visual feast of cinematic painting after painting - a rich tapestry of images that are breathtaking and ultimately visually satisfying. From the plains of Germania, to the desert stronghold of Zuchobar, and finally to great Rome herself, John Mathiesion, the cinematographer is to be commended highly for his general inventiveness and ability to capture so much on film. The opening  battle scene is superb as a cast of thousands erupt across the screen and provide an indication that we are about to see a film that pays incredible attention to detail throughout its entirety. In every way, Scott has created a world for us that scuttles films of similar epic undertakings (and budgets!) and sends them to their dooms at the bottom of the murky depths of film history where they belong.The cast is generally very strong. Crowe proves himself very suitable to the task with a great emotional range and depth of character. His accent ocassionally bugged me (as did the mish mash of accents on offer - but that is I guess a legacy of 'internationally casted films'), but this aside, he was well and truly up to the task. Phoenix is also excellent as the disturbed Commodus, as is Nielson as Lucilla, the daughter of Marcus who ""should have been a son"" and finds herself torn between loyalty to her brother and doing what is 'right'. The old guard thesps of Harris, Reed and Jacobi (Grachus) are uniformly strong as supporting characters, and Spencer Treat Clark (Lucius) does a fine job as the young heir to the throne.Add to this great cast excellent editing and post production work, and an intricate soundscape (including a magnificent Hans Zimmer score), and you have a film that, despite its length, was highly palatable and had me in there from beginning to end. A must see."
"The movie is the story of Maximus (Crowe), a general who leads the Roman army to victory over Germania in the beginning of the movie. The dying emperor of Rome, Marcus Aurelius, is watching this battle.The emperor's son, Commodus, then arrives with his sister Lucilla, and it is discovered that Commodus fully expects to be announced the new emperor of Rome in a few days. Aurelius, however, has other plans--he wants to make Maximus emperor, and requests that of the general, who wants nothing more than to go home to his family.I went into this movie having just watched Ben-Hur in my film studies class and having watched an episode of Xena only a couple of weeks earlier that featured the story of Marc Anthony and Cleopatra. So you could say I was in the perfect mindset to watch a ""sword-and-sandal"" movie. I wasn't sure what to expect, having somehow avoided all the hype that accompanied this movie. But I was not disappointed.Gladiator features some wonderful cinematography by John Mathieson. The battle scenes are very graphic. (This movie is not for the squeamish, that's for sure.) There were some scenes in particular that really struck me, such as when Crowe appears to be floating over the ground very fast.  The use of color and color tones added a great deal to the mood of the movie. Excellent.The script was being written and re-written as the filming was going on, yet it doesn't show that the actors had no idea how the movie was going to end when they began filming.  The acting is terrific. Russell Crowe is wonderfully cast as Maximus. Many reviewers agree that he is now officially a star. Joaquin Phoenix also proves his mettle as the emotionally troubled Commodus, whose behavior and emotion toward his sister could give anyone the creeps. Connie Nielsen makes you believe that, as Lucilla, she really is torn between natural loyalty to her brother and doing what she knows is right. Oliver Reed, in his last performance, is memorable in his role of Proximo, the former gladiator who is the owner of Maximus and brings him to Rome.  In short, the actors were brilliant in their roles, not over-acting, but giving subtle, strong performances.The script itself is very good.  Although some elements are a little hard to believe--the fact that no one recognizes Maximus when he's a slave?--this film calls for a willing suspension of disbelief, which one would happily comply with.  (It's really no fun to nitpick such a movie.)It's true that this movie does pretty much follow the Braveheart formula. However, this movie includes some elements, such as the cinematography and the incredibly graphic battle scenes (one reviewer likened it to Saving Private Ryan, ""only better""), that are spectacular in itself. Overall, a great movie that I highly recommend."
"I love history, and to me, Gladiator is a masterpiece. It is the most accurate picture of the Roman Empire Hollywood has ever put out.  People declare Spartacus a masterpiece, but Gladiator far outdoes Spartacus in quality.  The costuming, the acting, the screenplay, the scenery, and the fighting styles made me think that I had traveled back to 180 A.D. Russell Crowe is a true Hollywood tough guy, and he is superb in this movie. Joaquin Phoenix is outstanding as a villain, one of the best in movie history.  He played his character as if it were a psychologist's dream case. Connie Nielsen plays one of the strongest female characters that I have ever seen.  The choreographer of the action sequences was brilliant. Ridley Scott did an outstanding job in recreating the Empire, including the multitude of ethnic groups within the Empire and accurately depicting everyday life.  If you're looking for insight into what the Roman Empire was like, this is a perfect depiction."
"This is wonderful storytelling.  The opening Battle Scene simply mesmerizes, showing the brutal nature of combat for Roman conquests.  I went back to see the film again.  The first time I didn't hear anything Crowe said before the battle.  I was just too visually caught-up.  The second time I listened very closely and caught the wise yet succinct line from Maximus ""what we do in life... echoes in eternity.""  Awesome.A simple man v. an emperor.  I just loved the resilience Maximus showed throughout the movie.  I find in most movies, there is an irritatingly slow process where the character has to ""find himself,"" not so with Gladiator. Maximus does what is needed.I liked how there were only two or three issues within this film.  One was the afterlife.  Aspects of the afterlife are opened, but not overdone.  Love of family is given sizable focus. I liked the theme of love of country that we see as well, although it may not be justly deserved, it is never questioned.The visual effects were amazing.  It actually had me wanting to believe that's the way Rome actually looked in all it's glory.  The battle of Carthage reenactment was really great.The ending is just hypnotic. Intentionally or unintentionally it was simply emotional.  The music is wonderfully beautiful as if Maximus' family are telling him...you have arrived.Bottom line: magnificent.  Visually and emotionally satisfying."
"An intense Roman epic, a la ""Ben-Hur"" or ""Spartacus,"" it was nice to see something like this made again. It had been since the 1960s that we had seen a 3-hour extravaganza like this.Like Ben-Hur, this is a story of a successful man who loses everything thanks to an evil man, and then has to fight his way back up to seek revenge on that man and to obtain his freedom back. It's a tried-and-true formula. This movie doesn't go to excess on the violence as some of the other more recent epic films did, such as ""Braveheart"" or ""The Patriot.""The acting is excellent, beginning with Russell Crowe, who has established himself as one of the best actors of today. Joaquin Phoenix also put himself ""on the map"" as an actor with his portrayal of the evil ""Commodus."" He's so annoying you want to slap that sucker, which means he's doing a good job acting. Kudos to the rest of the cast, too.Too bad they don't make more of these type of films, as they did in the 1950s and 1960s."
"Gladiator! A thrilling tale of a Roman general who must battle against all thinkable odds to avenge the death of his family and restore justice to the empire. The plot is simple, legendary general Maximus Decimus Meridius, after many victorious campaigns and battles wants to return to his peaceful home in Spain, However the kind, fair and dying Emperor Marcus Aurelius wishes to bestow his title on him over his cruel son, Commodus. Commodus is understandably annoyed and kills his father calming the title of Emperor. Maximus is sentenced to death along with the rest of his family back at his home in Spain. Maximus escapes but is unable to save his wife and son. His loss of will to live makes him an east target for slavers and he is soon sold as a gladiator. He fights his way into the coliseum in Rome were he wins over the crowd and uses his celebrity status to defy the Emperor, to whom he swears his vengeance for the death of his family, after many battles and political backstabbing he gets his chance to fight the Emperor in the Arena.This is just such an amazing film, it captures every emotion possible in only the way an expert director can achieve, we can go on for whole scenes without the need for speaking, everything is told through the genuine body language and expressions. And when there is conversing we get such emotion and wonderfully powerful quotes  ""What we do in life, echoes in eternity"" Wow.The opening scene is spellbinding, showing the true gore of battle, the fight scenes are marvellously realistic, discarding the popular ""pretty"" sword fighting for brutal aggressive force. The audience in the arena express every emotion, surprise, anger, and enjoyment. The cast is brilliantly chosen; we can really see Russell Crowe as a gladiator, in Commodus, Joaquin Phoenix gives us a man we can really hate, Connie Nielson shows real emotion and passion in the role of Lucilla. So apart from the spellbinding acting, scarily realistic fight scenes and the amazing script, what else can we look for? The music is just stunning, its exactly what we need brought in at exactly the right time, truly wonderful directing. And then we have the stunning special effects, we can really visualise the greatness that is Rome, the fight scenes really make you believe. Some critics have condemned the lack of historical fact, for instance an emperor would never fight a gladiator, and these comments cannot be denied, its true.But I think we can forgive them that one fault for such an amazing movie. Without hesitation I give this movie a truly deserved 10/10!"
"I borrowed this movie on DVD, but I wish I had seen it in the theater for it would have been a lot more fun and powerful there. Despite this, Gladiator is one of the most powerful and moving films I've ever seen. The plot goes so smooth together, as well as the acting and the terrific musical score. Director Ridley Scott puts all effort into making this film an epic, and he does just that. I'd have to say that anyone who likes Ridley Scott (I sure do) should see this. It is a lot like Ridley's other movies (Black Hawk Down was also amazing). If you can stand a little bit--well, ok a LOT of blood and gore, then you should see this. Russell Crowe shows an excellent performance like no other. I don't think there's one bad movie that Ridley Scott has made or that Russell Crowe has acted in. The fact that the brutal battles involving innocent slaves in this film actually happened in real life centuries ago makes it even more interesting and powerful. Emperor Commodus is a truely evil and life-like villian who shows a lot of his wits in attempts to get his revenge against Maximus.Ridley Scott went to many different locations to shoot this film to make it real, and he does. The film is set in Rome, and it looks just like it. You feel as if you are there in the crowd, hearing them cheer and cheer to see the death. To some of you, this may sound a little barbaric, and believe me the film is VERY barbaric and brutual, however it teaches a very strong lesson of what happens when an economy turns as violent as Rome was. Ridley Scott goes to many lengths to make this movie real, because even though the characters are fictitious, all of this really did happen. Innocent people had to go through brutual fighting while thousands of people cheered for either their death or the enemy's death. If you were an inexperienced fighter, chances are you would get killed. But the strange thing is that Rome LOVED this. People came from all over to see these fights and to see the blood that was shed, that is why you can't blame the characters in this film for being so forlorn and saddened the whole time. The film itself is very dark. The theme is dark and the ending is dark. From beginning to end there is excessive violence (for those action movie-goers, this is a movie for you). But if the violence is concerning you, don't let it. The special effects make the movie great, but it's the acting and storyline that make it spectacular. HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED for anyone who wants a good time. Definitely makes you think. ***** out of *****."
"Gladiator is not just director Ridley Scott's ultimate masterpiece ( And i am also keeping the fantastic Alien & Blade Runner in mind when i say this ), it is also undoubtedly one of the most viscerally effective and emotionally compelling of motion pictures ever made.It plays somewhat like a modern Ben-Hur, as a very respectable character is forced into slavery due to him standing up for what is right. Of course, being a much more modern epic, the editing is a lot quicker, as is the entire pace of the picture. However,with 171 minutes playtime in the extended edition, Scott doesn't haste through this picture, and takes his time to set up his characters & their respective arcs. Gladiator is however not a flawless film, as several action sequences ( Particularly in the introduction in the battle of Germania ) feature quite a lot of shaky cam and quick editing, but admittedly this is nowhere near as bad as something like Taken or The Bourne Trilogy. Most of the action sequences are superbly edited, with widescreen shots to create an overview, combined with mediums to immerse the viewer into the action. A couple of times there is a shakycam shot in the middle of this, but it's a very minor issue. Another minor fault is in some of the backdrops. The 'Am i not merciful' scene features an obvious greenscreen, saturated a bit too brightly, and Proximo is obviously not physically there near the end of the film ( When actor Oliver Reed had already died ). Again these minor issues feature only in 1 scene respectively, and therefore do not really do anything to truly diminish the cinematic power that Gladiator provides.On the whole, the cinematography & art direction of Gladiator is impeccable. It is not the best, since as stated before there are a couple of lesser backdrops easily recognizable as greenscreens, but for most of the picture the viewer is subjected to beautiful angles, backdrops & sets. The scenes in Zuccabar are an example of the seductive natural beauty Gladiator provides, and Maximus's ride to his family after his execution attempt also feature some stunning environmental shots. Sets are elegantly crafted and varied in a beautiful color palette, becoming most apparent in Commodus's & Lucilla's scenes. The titanic image of the Colosseum is also one that is difficult to get rid of, despite the fact that i believe it was filmed in full CGI, but apart from perhaps the absolute final shot ( Burying the sculptures ), that is hardly noticable.The art of acting is utilized at its finest in Gladiator, with three absolute superb performances by leads Russel Crowe as Maximus, Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus & Connie Nielsen as Lucilla. Not to mention the fantastic supporting performances of legendary actor Richard Harris & Oliver Reed. Crowe is the epitome of a brick of stoic masculinity, yet he gave an utterly convincing and extended sob fest when gazing upon the sight of his crucified family, showing us his versatility as an actor. We see him win a battle against Germanians through his discipline, intelligence and courage, and we are rooting for his character from this moment forth. He is in his heart a simple man that just wants to go home to his family, but he is also honor bound to Rome, and proves this through his courageous actions. Not interested by the corruptions of power, he lives only to see justice done. Phoenix is superb as the corrupted emperor, showing us his envy of Maximus simply with one look into the eyes ( Look at Phoenix's superb facial acting in the scene where Maximus reveals himself to him in the arena ), his arrogance & his brutality. Nielsen is also quite underrated, as her disguised fear during every scene with her brother after their father's death is a stunning feat of acting within acting, culminating with her utter terror at the end when Commodus demands a 'pure blood' heir with her.Of course one cannot forget Hans Zimmer's fantastic contribution to his masterpiece, creating arguably his finest score to date, with this especially being the case during the transition between the (Again) 'Am i not merciful' scene and the shots of the arena. Obviously 'Now we are free' is also one of the most emotionally powerful scores ever created. It is also one of Zimmer's most varied scores, as a slight criticism of him is often his repeated melodies ( Admittedly, a lot of the themes in Gladiator still sound similar to The Rock, but a lot of them also do not ). In any case, it is rare to imagine the brilliance and emotional resonance of Gladiator without Zimmer's score.While the narrative is fairly straightforward as a revenge story, the dialogue written is superb, with many incredible lines such as 'What we do in life, echoes in eternity', not to mention the slow character development and character arcs, even within seemingly minor characters like Proximo & Quintus ( You will need to see the extended edition to witness Quintus's arc ) who have their original ideals challenged and overcome throughout the events in the film. Even though Maximus's sole purpose in life has become to kill Commodus in revenge for his family, it is in a way a very hopeful film. A film about standing up for what is right, and being granted redemption and a reunion with loved ones in the end. Maximus does not want to rule Rome, but in slaying Commodus, he secures the feature of it for is people, while also acquiring his personal goal. He demands respect for his valor and his morals throughout the film, and this makes sure that we as an audience are emotionally drained by the time he enters the Elysium fields, and is hailed as a hero by the people of Rome, and a hero he was.One of the all-time greats of epic motion pictures, Gladiator features impeccable acting, writing ,cinematography, art direction & a phenomenal original score. It also features possibly the most relatable main character ever written, which is partly why there are very little films that can equal the emotional power that Gladiator creates."
"When you go to the ruins of Rome now, you get really no sense of the scale and the grandeur of what that forum would have been It's hard to get it anywhere except from some of the great epic films of the past like ""Quo Vadis,"" ""Ben-Hur,"" ""Demetrius and the Gladiators,"" ""Barabbas,"" and ""The Fall of the Roman Empire."" Scott's ""Gladiator"" is build around a mythic character, a man trying to find his way home... It is around someone finding inner strength in a tough time Maximus is somebody who doesn't want to be a soldier We realize this is a man who is pursuing the ultimate which is transcending death and finding love after death which completely transforms your reaction to the man, a man who is very, very strong but very, very loving The plot, familiar from Anthony Mann's "" Fall of the Roman Empire,"" had Crowe as Maximus, the proud well-loved Roman general in the army of Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). Maximus whose motto is 'Strength and Honor' is like a son to Aurelius, a statement that left Aurelius' own son, Commodus perturbed...Disappointed by the news that his father privately decides to name Maximus his successor, and being a young ambitious son lusting for power, he murders his father, and orders a strike against the general... One of the best scenes of the motion picture is where Commodus is told by his father that he is not going to be the emperor Joaquin Phoenix is easy to hate in a frightening and vile character...Ridley Scott creates a lot of beautiful scenes between the characters He did some fantastic work in all of those wonderful scenes in the film But there's another moment between the emperor and his daughter Lucilla (the Danish beauty Connie Nielsen) that I loved very much Harris says, ""Let's not speak of politics. Let us pretend that you are a loving daughter and I'm a good father. "" They walk for a few seconds and Lucilla says, ""This is a pleasant fiction."" I felt this short scene so sophisticated It seemed to me wonderfully insightful, simple in terms of amount of words, but complex in terms of understanding this strange relationship One of the most successful bits of casting was Oliver Reed He's a harsh and rough businessman who makes his living off the death machine and yet, inside, there was some kind of ethical person that would come out at the right momentRidley Scott's epic film does not romanticize a democratic Golden Age of Rome but a decaying, blood thirsty empire on the edge of its fall... Through its beautiful music, through Russell's performance and through Ridley's soulfulness, ""Gladiator"" brought a poetic vision in a new and very cinematically richly way that really gave the audience something different, so emotional and so intimate"
"Germania, 150 AD, the setting of Gladiator's opening scene. Far from the blazing sun and dazzlingly beauty of ancient Rome, Ridley Scott shoots the opening sequence in a subdued light. The Roman legions are nonetheless impeccably turned out as they face the comparatively disorganised rabble that inhabits this miserable environment. Caesar's soldiers seem somewhat misplaced here. However, Russell Crowe is at home in this environment of knee-deep mud and merciless snow. He commands the screen with all the virtues of his motto: Strength and Honour.'The plot, with its hero-to-zero-to-hero nature, runs through Gladiator's every vein. As General Maximus, Russell Crowe is welcomed by Marcus Aurelius Caesar (Richard Harris) to take the Roman throne as Emperor of a new Republic. All does not run smoothly however as mislead heir to the throne Commodus (Phoenix) takes over Rome with ill-gotten domination, having dispatched his own Father. Maximus is cast out to find his family murdered and his Spanish farm burnt to the ground. Taken in as a slave by Proximo (Reed), Maximus becomes a Gladiator and starts his journey to the Coliseum and revenge against Commodus.Scott's cast is powerful and he is not left wanting as powerful performances are delivered by all. Due to his untimely mid-production death, Oliver Reed is created in some scenes by the grace of computer graphics, which are as convincing as they come; sometimes making it difficult to differentiate between Reed himself and his computerised counterpart.
It is, however, the supporting actors who create many of Gladiator's best dialogue-based scenes. In an accomplished demonstration of her acting ability as Lucilla, Connie Nielsen saves the occasional scene as Joaquim Phoenix shows us that he can do evil', but is less convincing when it comes to the more emotional qualities of his role.As a vehicle for the plot, Scott's beautifully created and highly symbolic (there is an image of fire in nearly every shot of the film) dialogue scenes are of a certain merit with digitally created backgrounds that encompass the meticulous nature of the Roman Empire. However, dialogue alone does not an epic movie make, and it is in the film's spectacular action sequences that Gladiator come into its own. Shot on location in Malta, Scott's first arena was built by an army of locals and commanded some 5000 extras (a large majority of whom were of a cardboard variety). All of this pales in comparison as we arrive in a digitally created Rome which makes some scenes in Ben Hur some somewhat small scale. The Coliseum is immense, both inside and out, and the computerised provides the electric atmosphere in which Crowe and his feline companions (four sizeable, and real, Bengal tigers) perform.The battle sequences are perfectly choreographed and shot as iconic masks and typically Roman chariots are abundant in their power and imagery. As swords clash and heads roll, Ridley Scott is triumphant in the application of special effects technology and his directorial prowess.Always one to embrace technology, Scott's views over Rome's landscape are reminiscent of the beautifully created cityscape of Blade Runner. This is a film that fears so little and boasts so much, even a lady archer being sliced clean in half by a spiked chariot wheel!All those involved with Gladiator should be delighted and confident with their creation, for indeed this is a convincing and enthralling display with epic proportions to take the wind from James Cameron's titanic sails."
"If only Peter Jackson hadn't come along and done a rather good trilogy of films, we might possibly be talking about the greatest film of the 21st Century so far. Its sweeping but simplistic heroic tale, crunching fight scenes, award-winning special effects, towering acting and soaring score set this film apart from all the pretenders that followed it. Ridley Scott single-handedly re-invented the epic genre with this story of a Roman solider who is betrayed, loses everything and is sold into slavery, only to fight his way back as a gladiator, all the while driven by vengeance for his murdered family.Russell Crowe gives quite simply the performance of a lifetime as the Gladiator Maximus, one that deservedly won him Best Actor at the 2000 Academy Awards (although his performance in the following year's Beautiful Mind was arguably even better, even if it didn't win him his second consecutive Oscar), and provided a thinking woman's alternative to the likes of Pitt, Cruise and Clooney to swoon over. His gravely voice and impressive physique combine to give him a huge presence, which literally fills the screen. His dialogue is sparing, but his actions speak far louder, adding a stoic sadness to his vengeance-driven heroic character. Before Gladiator, Crowe was a good secondary actor; after Gladiator he was catapulted to the top of Hollywood's A-list, and remains there, thanks to this career-making performance proving him to be one of the finest actors of his generation.Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic as the scheming and corrupt Emperor Commodus who betrays Maximus and has his family killed. He manages to be delightfully and totally evil without ever descending into the realms of pantomime villain, which is a tricky line to walk, and manages to avoid being overshadowed by Crowe's monumental performance.The fight scenes are rousing and superbly choreographed, in particular a scene where Maximus marshals his fellow slaves into an army against marauding chariot archers in the Colosseum. The dialogue is kept simple and never overbearing (no need to worry why all of Europe speaks the same language) and culminates in one of the most memorable pieces of script that is destined to join the ranks of 'Play it Sam' and 'Are you talking' to me' as one of the most quoted (and misquoted) lines in movie history  although it is rather wordy. But here it is, in full; 'My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius. Commander of the Armies of the North, General of the Felix Legions, loyal servant to the true Emperor Marcus Aurelius; Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife, and I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next.' As Crowe turns to the Emperor in the arena and delivers this line, it proves to be one of the most electrifying moments in cinema history  hairs will stand up, spines will tingle, guaranteed.The action is set to some truly beautiful music, and it is shameful Hans Zimmer missed out on the Oscar for Best Score. Ridley Scott was similarly unlucky in the Director category.The film is however tinged with sadness, as it proved to be the final (but triumphant) swansong for the careers of Oliver Reed and Richard Harris, both of whom died shortly after making this film. Neither could have delivered much finer performances, and if any performance had to be a final one, both delivered one worthy of such a status here. Reed in particular is a revelation, reminding older generations and showing a new generation of his considerable talent.An inspiring film, rousing, exhilarating, exciting and moving. Superbly acted, directed, scored and visualised. A tribute to how great films could be once, and could be again."
"A great film and easily one of the better his ancient history films. Ridley Scott created a new wave for this genre and rightly so. Russell Crowe is incredible in the lead and provides one of great central performances. The film didn't deserve to be this great, but the filmmaking of Scott and the grand cast create one of the better films of the genre."
"This movie is awesome! I think it's great to be in one of IMDb's top 250 best movies, because it deserves it. Every time I watch 'Gladiator'I stay touched by the story and I never get bored of it.It's one of the most excellent movies already made in the movie's history! Russel Crowe is terrific in the role of Maximus and so is Joaquim phoenix great as commodus. For people who enjoys history,specially ancient history,is a chance to see how was Rome many centuries ago, and also know better about the gladiators, the Colosseum and how some things worked in that time.I will not write about the plot here, because many people already did this; I will only say for people that never watched this movie, that it deserves to be watched and, if you have some money, buy the DVD!"
"There is so little to find wanting in this film and not wanting to merely repeat its many deserved praises, all I can do is question a couple of historical points.It is unlikely that a Roman general would be sold into slavery and forced to fight in the arena. Exiled, yes. Killed maybe. Asked to commit suicide to retain his property, most likely. It is unlikely that he would return to find his family crucified, of all things. Romans were very specific about who got crucified and why. Romans usually avoided it, no matter how cruel the tyrant(?) was.Roman legionnaires would NEVER have a tattoo unless they were barbarians who got one BEFORE joining a legion. Marking or mutilating the human body was expressedly anti- Roman. No statue or depiction exists of a main-period Roman showing a body-marking. The bonding feature the writer was attempting was an inappropriate borrowing from the 20th century German SS.Great entertaining movie nonetheless."
"Breathtaking Sword and Sandals plenty of swordplay , perfect cast ,lively pacing , massed action ,dastardly plots and many other things . The late second century : the Roman army is fighting Germania where takes place a bloody carnage . Troops are commanded by general Maximus (Russell Crowe). Ailing Marcus Aurelius ( Richard Harris) would like his confident and favorite to take over empire , but the events go wrong . Mean heir Comodus's (Joaquin Phoenix) vices arise from poor parental care as he takes power. When the Roman general is betrayed and his family murdered by an emperor's corrupt son , the insecure Commodus feels powerful . Having ensured father dies in his arms , the new emperor exerts his killer fury . Maximus , then comes to Rome as a gladiator to seek revenge .He won't swear loyalty and gets a chance to redeem himself .Father of a murdered son , husband to a murdered wife and I shall have my revenge in this life or the next .This bloody good movie has great action sequences well staged with stylish and vitality , thrills ,fundamental emotions , fortright spectacle ,fierce combats including scud catapults , and is pretty entertaining . The film results to be a special remake to ¨Fall of Roman Empire¨ directed by Antony Mann with Stephen Boyd , Sofia Loren and Christopher Plummer as Commodus , though is a little revisionist about characters , history and time when is developed the action . Before directing ¨Robin Hood , Kingdom of heaven¨ films , director Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe teamed but with much bigger budget . The final product looked as although the actors learn the screenplay and decided the best issue was to take a good time and amuse themselves and both managed to stage some excellent action scenes . Great performances abound , as stalwart Russell Crowe playing an enslaved ex-general who bent on vengeance , he is very fine ; in addition , vacilating empress Connie Nielsen is memorable and attractive , she comes up the film as a valiant and obstinate woman . Special mention to gladiator owner magnetically performed by Oliver Reed and Joaquin Phoenix as evil and crazed emperor in a sensationalistic interpretation . Marvelous relationship between Maximus-Russel Crowe and an African slave-Dijimon Honsou , the deep bond lends a P.C. historicity. Ample support cast formed by notorious British secondaries as David Hemmings David Schofield , John Schrapnel and endearing Derek Jacobi . There are great action sequences including the battle against Barbarians and the final confrontation in arena at the climax of the film. Impeccable but sometimes dark cinematography by John Mathieson . Movie is shot on natural sets and interior scenarios with impressive production design by Arthur Max , but also excessive use of computer generator images . Magnificent and sensible musical score by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard , including wonderful songs .I found it fun , well-acted , in Peplum tradition and fast-paced.The motion picture packed with pomp and pageantry is lavishly produced by the prestigious Douglas Wick and David Franzoni , also screenwriter ; being glamorously directed by Ridley Scott , at his best and as stylish as ever , similarly his previous film ¨Someone to watch over me¨ and others as ¨Blade runner¨, ¨Black rain¨ , ¨Legend¨ in which his visual style is impressive . The picture belongs to his speciality ,the historical genre , as ¨Robin Hood¨ , ¨Kingdom of heaven¨ , ¨Duelists¨ and ¨Black Hawk down¨ . Rating : Above average . Essential and indispensable watching for Ridley Scott followers"
"Can you still make a great period movie, which is commercially viable too in these days? Apparently you can, as Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe prove with this magnum opus.What strikes you most about ""Gladiator"" are not the dazzling sets and costumes - though they contribute to the effect too. Where ""Gladiator"" delivers is in the area of raw human emotions we are so familiar with.As somebody said, switching to the other mind-set is half the fun, and Gladiator takes you right to the midst of Romans' politics, their passions, their dreams and their weaknesses.After Ben-Hur, I feel this is the best period movie to have ever emerged from Hollywood.-Murali Chari"
"Gladiator is the prime example of filmmaking at its best: massive set pieces, honest acting, and a plot to back up the gravity of the scenes. Moving from the forests of Germany and the fighting pits of Zucchabar, before culminating in the Colosseum of Rome, Scott's historical epic flows seamlessly. Russell Crowe gives an Oscar-worthy performance as the grizzled but vengeful Maximus, plotting a course back to the Emperor Commodus (equally brilliantly played by Joaquin Phoenix). The fighting pits emulate the unrest within the capital, as discord grows between the emperor and the Senate.Fighting scenes are appropriately epic: realistic imagery and brutal military style are on full show, accentuated by the devotion paid to the costume design of the film. Hans Zimmer is, as usual, perfect in scoring the film, adding both a solemness to darker scenes, whilst capturing the heat of battle when required. The fine acting is merely the icing on the cake. Not a wrong step is taken, from the leads down to the more minor roles (a personal favourite is Djimon Hounsou as Maximus' gladiatorial ally Juba).Gladiator comes together perfectly in all facets of film - there is a perfectly good reason this is such a highly acclaimed film, and for all the right reasons. Ridley Scott has earned his reputation here."
"This movie is brilliant, one of the all time-greats. It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time and I would recommend it to anyone. Specifically, Russel Crowe did an incredible job and was believable in his performance. He took me right back to the time of Ancient Rome. This movie is bound to have a visceral effect on anyone who watches it, this much I can guarantee."
"Take one part awesome, one part incredible, and one part inspiring and you have one of the greatest movies of all time. Easily on my top ten list this movie ""defines"" good movie making. With incredible cinematic deftness Mr. Scott has outdone himself, I doubt he will ever be able to top this masterpiece he has created with no little help from incredible actors, Crowe, Phoenix, and the rest of the spectacular cast helped to bring life to this film in ways I have never seen before. The talent brought on by all creative teams involved is amazing and I can only hope that more films will follow in the footsteps of excellence that this fine production has laid out. A true 10 without question."
"Gladiator is terrific.  It is definitely one of my top 5 films of all time. I'm sure everyone knows the plot by now. Russell Crowe is one bad a**  MF that kicks major b*tt.  Not to mention he looks so hot as he is decapitating and slashing the competition.  But what makes this movie great is the story line is heart felt and you feel for Maximus after his family is murdered. It is the ultimate tale of revenge.
Russell Crowe is a great actor. I never heard of him before Gladiator but since seeing this I have watched a bunch of other films he is in. He's pretty good in them all. He should have won the oscar for The Insider and for A Beautiful Mind rather than Gladiator though, but just because those two movies were more ""oscar-like"".
FINAL VERDICT:  A definite must see. I have this one on tape to watch it over and over again."
"The acting, action sequences and everything make this a great film. Gladtior was one of the best DVD's of the year 2000. The amazing transfer is one of the best on the market. The sound quailty and picture make you feel as if you're in the theater again. The first disc is the feature and the detailed commentary by Ridley Scott. While the second disc is tv spots, trailers , documentary's and my personla favorite delted scenes. The dvd has over thirty mintues of delted scenes. This DVD's gives good character devloepment and has veyr cool montage."
"Gladiator is one of those movies where you just know what's going to happen next.  After returning from war, Maximus (Russell Crowe) is to be given the crown as emperor of Rome, but instead is sent to be executed once the Emperor's son (Joaquin Phoenix) kills the emperor and takes it for himself. After escaping execution and winding up a slave and a gladiator, you just know how the movie is going to go.  While the scenery and battle sequences are great, the predictability and general lack of caring about most of the characters makes this a rather unspectacular movie.  Crowe does a decent, but not Oscar-worthy job of portraying Maximus while Phoenix does an equally decent job as portraying the evil, self-centered emperor Commodus.  No one else in the cast is really given all that much for character depth and thus I never really cared about most of them. I give the movie 9/10 stars for the special effects and 7/10 for everything else, averaging an 8/10 for the movie."
"Gladiator was an excellent example of what action films can be, when the writer and director truly care about the total presentation.  The film is mostly accurate with it's portrayal of the time period, and the writing gives the viewer a sense of connection with these men.  The violence was shown in a manner that did not detract from the story.  Before I saw the film I had trepidations due to the subject matter, but all the graphic shots were quick and to the point, showing the nature of the combat, but not ""gore for gore's sake"".Overall, one of the finest films I have seen."
"When I first saw this movie it reminded me of Braveheart.  Then I thought to myself that this movie posses a quality that Braveheart does not.  It possesses the quality that you get satisfaction at the end of the movie.  In Braveheart you do not get satisfaction at the end and it is difficult to watch many times.  I believe that that is the reason why Braveheart didn't do as well as Gladiator did in the box office but did win 5 Oscars.  This movie is a work of art.  The score complements the movie so well. Lisa Gerrard and Hans Zimmer deliver the movie in music notes rather than words. Russell Crowe is great in the movie and reminds me alot of Richard Burton. He is an up and coming star who is destined 2 win an Oscar.  Joaquin Phoenix also delivers a great performance worthy of an Oscar.  The late Oliver Reed is outstanding.  Reed seems to steal the scene that he is in from all the other actors because of his acting power.  Ridley Scott delivers a classic film that will remain in our memory and our hearts.  If you haven't seen this movie, please do, you will not regret it."
"All I can say about this movie is that it is absolutely brilliant. The story is strong, the acting (especially Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix) is exceptional, the fight scenes are thrilling, and the computer generated Rome is great. This is hands down my favorite movie of the year, when I first saw the previews I immediately was interested, there hasn't been a Roman epic in Hollywood for years, my expectations were high and it delivered! Everything from the incredible cinematography to the powerful score fit the movie perfectly, this is a great movie, I give a 10 out of 10."
I think this a Great movie with a great story.  The actors did a superb performance. There is rarely a movie that I can watch over and over but this is truly one I can because every time you watch it there is always something else to see.  The scenery is great and the music is wonderful. I think this is a must see movie.
"I saw this movie first when it came out on the big screen, but unfortunately was not able to fully appreciate it because of the people in the movie theater. Fortunately this Christmas I received the DVD as a gift and was delighted when I watched it. It is just one of those movies that when it ended I wanted to know more. I HIGHLY recommend this movie to EVERYONE! So if you have not seen it yet, please do!"
"My daughter bought me the video for Christmas, and we watched it on Christmas Day.We all flinched, gasped, sighed and cried right to the very end. I fell in love, and my daughter, who is nine and a half and has almost 300 videos, said it was the best film she had ever seen.I am one of those people who watches movies to be entertained, and this did it for me.10/10"
"We thought that the star of director Ridley Scott was going to disappear thanks to unsuccessful movies like the good  ""Albatross"" or the really weird ""G. I. Jane"", but fortunately he is came back with a success like ""Gladiator"" and a promising title like ""Hannibal"". Even if doesn't absolutely respect history, this movie is a beautiful work and a great wonder for our eyes. Scott directs the battle with great ability, helped by the editing of the great Italian Pietro Scalia (Academy Award winner for ""JFK""): the initial battle in the woods is frenetic and impressive with the force of a thunder and the fights in the arenas are exceptional, a demonstration of what the evolution in movies can do. And also the cast, which sometimes is sacrificed for the show, shows a very great power: Russell Crowe is a suffering but determined Maximus, Joaquin Phoenix an evil, weak and complex Commodus, Connie Nielsen is so beautiful than good actress and then there is a great english trio formed by Richard Harris, Derek Jacobi and Oliver Reed (dead during the shots). Giorgio Cantarini (Benigni's son in ""La Vita è Bella"") plays the brief role of Maximus' son. We mustn't also forget the red photography by John Mathieson, the rich art direction of Arthur Max (a name, a program) and the wonderful themes composed by Hans Zimmer, featuring the splendid vocals of Lisa Gerrard. Wonderful!"
"This movie is so well done, that you are overwhelmed. I can frankly say that there is not even a single boring moment during the whole length. I will begin my description with the shooting. The movie has such great shots, that you will be truly impressed. There wasn't any saving made by the producers with the staging of the scenery. It has been set to resemble perfectly the Roman times. The fighting scenes in the gladiator's arena are shocking, but tastefully done. Actually, the movie begins with a battle between a Roman legion and a German tribe's army. Great shots! It is much better than the fights in Braveheart. The other impressive side of the movie is the consistency of the plot. The movie has a coherent plot which sends us a clear picture of the happenings, without limiting the suspension. You cannot guess the end of the movie at all, and neither the next step, but as it happens it is logic. The last but not least is Crowe's acting. I have never heard about this actor until this movie, but he plays very well. He is manly and sensitive altogether. I commend its casting, when other candidates were more known. You just have to see this movie, and you will be convinced that the great epic era of the fifties was finally reproduced and surpassed."
"I was expecting a action flick and to my delight found a beautifully crafted historically accurate and totally engrossing masterpiece. Wow! Who would have thought anything this good could come out in the so-called ""New Millennium""? It harkens back to the great movies of yesteryear in its honesty, its willingness to treat the viewer as an intelligent human being. Perhaps there is hope for humans after all."
"I saw the movie on video because I was nervous of the gore others had mentioned, but the movie was like a poem. You could not have left out one drop of blood, one terrifying character, one disturbing dream, nor could you have added anything at all. Deeply violent, yet not one gratuitous drop of blood was shed, not one encounter without reason. A classically made film, and a beaut. Don't miss it, whether or not you've seen something that disappointed you, or had a bad day at the arena. Think ""Spartacus"" and you've got it."
"Gladiator is the best epic war film. Gladiator has the best war scenes I've ever scene. Better than Troy and much better than Alexander. I liked the digital effects in Gladiator. Troy and Alexander are pretty fun to watch, but in Alexander, i really want to forward it to exciting scenes, like war sequences. Gladiator, I can just sit there and watch it, because if you miss a part, you won't get it. The end was great, i really liked it. It was the best fight scene at the end. Every part kept me interested and there wasn't one part that bored me. It had one of the best endings ever. So if your tired of crappy, imitating war movies go to this one it's the best there is.10/10"
"Great action, story and acting. Full marks for being one of the best films ever made.It is not historically accurate with the plot but that's not the point (it seems a mash of different events and people who existed at one time or another in during the Roman Empire. From what I know of ancient Rome the story is within the realms of possibility.) The characters are all great. Pheonix is annoying but intentionally so - he acts his character perfectly. The script is kind of poetic at times - it seems it underwent at least three full scale revisions by different masters of script writing.There are a number of different accents in the film but then Rome was probably a pretty multicultural place and we're hardly going to wish they had made it in Latin."
"There's all you might imagine, a real life situation for an epic. Remember that such battles where very common, not to mention the thousands of lives lost. Ridley Scott put the viewer into suspense and tension during the very first battle we had, not to mention the grandiose strategy Maximus had.Shot in Malta: Ricasli and other locations, the arena built had over 5000 extras. All awaiting for the signal...Roar did the crowd when Maximus entered. They loved him, a man of honour, a normal being, a prisoner, a warrior. Their HERO!Ridley Scott direction excelled at its best in Gladiator conveying the authenticity of life, our ancestors have lived!"
"Even before seeing this movie in the theater I fell in love with the score. Once I saw the movie I knew I had to add it to my collection. This was the only movie I had to see in the theater more than once. As soon as it came out on DVD I bought it and watched it over and over again. The plot is awesome, the effects are absolutely amazing and the score pulls it all together magnificently. The added documentaries and features on the DVD set are well worth watching again also. I highly recommend this movie for anyone's collection and also recommend checking out Hans Zimmer's other works."
"There is much to appreciate about about this picture but at the same time there is much to castigate as well. What could have been a thoroughly involving story turns out to be crippled by a lean script, some very indecisive direction and choppy editing. Not to mention some bad casting in the form of Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius, a role which cries out to have been the last role played by Anthony Quinn.The film starts out well and looks bleakly authentic in its depiction of the pivotal battle in the wars between the barbarian tribes of Germania and the Roman Empire. But as the story gives way to 40 minutes of exposition following Commodus and Lucilla's introduction, Ridley Scott seems to tack things on whenever the script runs into weak spots. This leaves the film without a flowing narrative and it seems to want to please a mindless summer movie action market while at the same time aspiring to be something deeper. What it leaves us with is a schizophrenic, unequivocal story full of contradictions. There seems to be an epidemic in the past three or four years - films like this, Titanic, The Patriot, Pearl Harbor, Enemy at the Gates etc, try hard to be great epic films but at their core they are very slight and even trivial. The story in Gladiator holds promise but what little conflict there is set up and thrown at us in the first hour, leaving just a linear resolution to unfold for the remainder. A shame because so many elements could have been introduced in this story to make it truly an awesome and thoughtful epic. I guess complex stories like Spartacus and Ben-Hur will never be made again. This one falls somewhere short, though better than Demitrius and the Gladiators and the film it heavily borrows its narrative structure from - The fall of the Roman Empire.Technically the CGI is at times seamless and other times poor. When our troop of Gladiators run into the colosseum for the first time however the effect is absolutely jaw dropping and the scene that follows certainly delivers the action goods. The acting is very good throughout except for Tomas Arana as Quintus (about as bad as John Dall in Spartacus) and the aforementioned Richard Harris. Like Braveheart, not a bad entertainment experience but highly Hollywoodized and with an uneven narrative. But unlike Braveheart, the ending to Gladiator is a just a little embarrassing as it rips off both Braveheart and Titanic to far less effect. If you can get past the flaws, not the worst Roman spectacle on offer. Too highly rated at 8.1/10."
"I am usually worried that I'm in for a big let-down when I am looking forward to a film as much as I was to this one.  This time however, I was very pleasantly suprised, when Gladiator not only fulfilled but surpassed my expectations.  It's a brilliant film, which (while containing weaknesses such as a script which wasn't quite as good as it could have been, and one climactic scene which completely changes, and ruins, the ending) manages to engage your heart and mind.The performances are without exception excellent (although the accents may distract a bit, there is such a wide variety of them).  I must single out for commendation Mr. Phoenix, who despite his youth manages to portray a character with such conviction that you never for a moment doubt his interpretation.  His physical performance is as good as his mental one.The film rests firmly on the (extremely attractive and capable) shoulders of one Russell Crowe.  In a tour-de-force performance, he manages to convey a man (not a superhuman) with frailties and doubts and fears and heart.  I cannot convey to you how brilliant this man's performance was.  If anyone else had been this character, the film would have rated at best a five out of ten.Kudos to Russell Crowe, and to Ridley Scott, for managing to keep this film on a level with humanity, rather than one in which the characters become killing machines.A must see, five stars out of five."
"Ridley Scott was drawn to direct this project by a painting entitled ""Thumbs down"", which depicted a scene (seen a few times in the film) where a gladiator is sentenced to death by the emperor. It is a moment of pure theatre and that is part of the cinematic appeal of the idea of Rome – an idea which had for forty years or so been ignored. Scott's resulting vision was an epic which has been one of the most influential films of the decade.The story is epic in scope, but powerful in its detail. Maximus, general of the armies of the north, is favoured by the Emperor to become the protector of Rome. The Emperor's son, Commodus, kills his father before this happens and condemns Maximus to death. Maximus escapes execution and flees to his home where he finds his wife and child murdered. He is caught by slave traders and becomes a popular gladiator intent on revenge. The work on the script should not be underestimated as this is an effective story of a man trying to avenge his family and, on some level, get home.Maximus sees Russell Crowe in one of his finest performances. He brings charisma and magnetism to the screen which makes Maximus sympathetic and engaging for both genders: a proper, fully developed character and not just an action hero to be adored by teenage boys. Joaquin Phoenix was underrated as Commodus, bringing to bear insecurity and weakness with a terrifying edge, making him one of the greatest villains of recent years. Richard Harris's appearance is all too brief in this film but is memorable enough to be counted as his last great performance. Oliver Reed meets Crowe's performance stroke for stroke and is a great presence in this film (his performance became noted for being completed with the aid of CGI after his death toward the end of filming).Scott, however, is the real star of this film, making a world as rich and detailed as the one he created in ""Blade Runner"" and delivering a terrific story masterfully. The film looks stunning and has a fine Hans Zimmer score. Once again, the computer effects were another step forward (the Coliseum was largely created by visual effects) and have not dated much in nearly ten years.The film's influence cannot be denied (wheat is now a staple image of otherworldliness) and the decade that has followed has been stuffed with historical epics (""Troy"", ""Alexander"", ""300""), none of which have been as successful or as effective. Its claim to greatness however comes from its ability to satisfy those who had come for story and character and those who came for action and excitement. It is the ultimate blockbuster."
"The beginning of ""Gladiator"" is powerful. We see the Roman Legion fighting against the Germanic tribes in what surely must be one of the most spectacular battle scenes ever filmed; one which truly does give the viewer a taste of what warfare in that era must have been like. The ending is powerful, as the quest for vengeance finally comes to a head, with General Maximus facing the Emperor Commodus in a gladiatorial contest in the Roman arena. In between - well - things could have been a little better.The acting in this movie, I thought, was first-rate. Russell Crowe as General Maximus, Joaquin Phoenix as Emperor Commodus and Connie Nielsen as Lucilla, sister of Commodus, all played their parts perfectly. The gladiatorial bouts were superbly choreographed. The set decoration was magnificent, and looked exactly as I would expect Imperial Rome to have looked. So, why do I say this could have been better?(POSSIBLE SPOILERS)Basically, the whole thing was just a bit too clear-cut for me. Maximus was too obviously the good guy, Commodus too obviously the bad guy. With this being so clear, we know that the movie must be heading for the final confrontation between the two, and it makes watching the middle 90 minutes or so difficult. ""Get on with it,"" I found myself thinking from time to time. It didn't have to be quite so clear cut. The potential was there to give the viewer a real ethical choice to make. I mean, one can understand Commodus being angry when Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) - his father - takes away the throne that Commodus had believed all his life would be his, and hands control of Rome over to Maximus. Commodus could have been a sympathetic character. He didn't have to murder his father. His father was elderly; a natural death wouldn't have been out of the question. And why the incestuous fascination with Lucilla? I didn't think it added anything to the movie - except to make Commodus even more repulsive. In the end, the movie didn't make me think about anything; it didn't challenge me with any moral decision-making; it didn't make choosing sides in this battle even remotely difficult.Don't get me wrong. This was a very good movie. One can always argue whether this movie or that should have been named best picture; one certainly has to agree that ""Gladiator"" was worthy of consideration. I just felt it could have been better. In the end, I give it a rating of 7/10."
"In Rome circa 185 AD, General Maximus (Russell Crowe) leads a successful expedition against Germanic tribes in the northern empire. Dying Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) confides that he is to succeed as Emperor, to the chagrin of the vain, ego-maniacal Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), who kills Marcus and usurps the throne. Maximus is expelled from the army, his family is killed, and he ultimately ends up in Rome as a gladiator for Proximo (Oliver Reed). Defying the will of the Emperor and eager to have his revenge, Maximus becomes a hero to the masses and joins Commodus's sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) and a cabal of Senators led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) in an attempt to bring down Commodus.Gladiator is something of a paradox. As a well-made, entertaining action film, it's hard to beat. Its attempts to be something more, however... not so much. It's very entertaining, an excellent crowd-pleaser to be sure, but it's far from the great film it's widely considered to be.Gladiator wants to be something significant. Its multi-faceted plot, its commentary on society, its distinguished cast of actors, epic battle scenes, and great musical score almost push it there. The movie borrows heavily from ""Fall of the Roman Empire"" (settings and characters), ""Spartacus"" and ""Ben-Hur"" (for the plot). This is not a criticism, merely an observation. And the movie does have an inkling of being something more than just another action movie. And yet it fails, because at heart it is basically ""Braveheart"" in a toga.Perhaps I'm just not enthralled by the film's basic storyline. See if this sounds familiar: A successful warrior who wants only to live in peace is roused to ass-kicking action by the death of his family at the hands of cartoonishly evil villains. This is the plot of ""Braveheart"", ""The Patriot"", and innumerable Westerns, action films, and Steven Seagal/Chuck Norris slugfests. Death of family members is an easy motivation for a character, and dare I suggest a lazy one. Maximus isn't a thoughtful, conflicted hero like T.E. Lawrence or Spartacus, he's just a man of action who wants to wreak vengeance on those who wronged him. In spite of its attempts to convince us otherwise, the movie is basically a Schwarzenegger or Van Damme flick set in Roman times with a lead actor who can act.The subplots of the film don't fare much better. The character of Commodus in particular is a disappointment. One of the few good things about ""Fall of the Roman Empire"" is Christopher Plummer's portrayal of Commodus. Commodus is an egomaniac with delusions of grandeur. He's not horribly complex in that film but Plummer makes it work. Whether it's the script or Joaquin Phoenix's acting, this film's Commodus is a sniveling weakling. I appreciate the effort to give him motivation (his father never truly loved him) but in his big scene with Marcus Aurelius, Commodus doesn't come across as heart-broken, merely insincere. Commodus is a petulant child who lacks menace. David Schofield's duplictious Senator Falco is a much more effective bad guy. The Senate plot against the Emperor is under-developed and comes across as a bad pastiche of ""Spartacus"".On a purely action level, the movie is pretty good. The epic battle which opens the film is not particularly impressive in my opinion, but the gladiator combats later in the film are impressive. The visceral thrill of a gladiatorial match comes across well, particularly when Proximo's gladiators ""upset"" an enemy team. The fight between Maximus and the ""Tigress of Gaul"" is very well-handled, as is the final duel between Commodus and Maximus. The CGI is of mixed quality. It's impressive in some scenes (notably Commodus's entry into Rome) but in other parts it's murky and distracting. Hans Zimmer's score is haunting and helps drive the film's more powerful moments.The movie excels largely because of Russell Crowe. FOTRE failed because Stephen Boyd is a block of wood; Crowe, playing a very similar role, excels. Maximus is not a particularly noble hero but he's a fabulous action star, and Crowe does bring a degree of intelligence and complexity to complement the ass-kicking. The supporting cast is mostly under-used. Djimon Honsou, Oliver Reed, David Schofield and Derek Jacobi give the most memorable supporting performances in the film despite very limited screen time. Richard Harris is disappointing as Marcus Aurelius, and Joaquin Phoenix and Connie Nielsen aren't particularly compelling either.""Gladiator"" is one of the best action films ever made, on a purely action level. But in its attempts to be something more... well, not so much, I'm afraid.7/10"
"Movie is technically very fine i have watched in theater twice and i like it much as lots of turks but sometime after the reason why we loved this movie became clear this was only a western look over an old Turkish movie series Tarkan... Maximus was so Turkic that he was wearing lamb fur(lamb was introduced by Huns to Europe) instead of bright armors of Romans,Like Tarkan he rides along his wolf, his family has been murdered by his foes ... you can claim that these may be inspirations of Ridley Scott from Tarkan but there are some scenes taken directly from Tarkan movies...1- Maximus fights a big German guy - Tarkan's fight against Giant Orso both are under snow.. 2- After the fight in arena, emperor orders death- neither Tarkan nor Maximus kill the victims. 3-The scene of birds over Rome 4-The appear order and camera movements in the arena at least the final is different, Maximus dies though Tarkan is immortal"
"There is an unwritten rule in movie making that if you have an excellent script it doesn't matter how you film it. If you have a lousy script - then everything else matters, the direction, the cinematography, the acting, the music... ""Gladiator"" is an epitome of the latter half of that rule. The case where direction, music, acting and art direction completely redeemed a crappy story.For me it took watching it in German overdubbing. As I don't speak German there was nothing to detract me from visuals and music. And it's a new experience on another level. But more on that later. First the crappy part. The story.Make no mistake, whether you care about history or not, this is a horrible script. It's taking huge (and quite unacceptable) liberties with the period it purports to portray, it's unconvincing even on its own terms, the dialog is pretty much high school and in its core it's a predictable revenge story told a zillion times before. Apparently (according to a documentary about Hollywood screenwriters) only Russell Crowe didn't know what turd the script was so he contributed himself with the juvenile ""husband of the dead wife"" speech.Ridley Scott and his crew apparently knew what stinker they had to work with and did their best to defeat it with excellence in all areas and actually made two films in one.On the surface it's a revenge story. The hero, a favorite army general turned gladiator, seeks revenge against a young emperor, who had general's family killed during the tumultuous succession to the throne. The military battles and the gladiatorial bouts required for this aspect of the movie are done both to tremendous detail and on a grand scale. With the help of CGI they are seen in all their glory and gore. Some accuse Scott of shying away from action but his direction shows everything one needs to see. Yes, the cuts are brief, the camera sometimes doesn't follow through, but the editing is pure poetry and you miss nothing. Cinematography-wise every frame is shot in a way that you could just hang it on a wall as a nice picture. Costumes and scenery are impeccable. A revenge story, yes, but well worth watching.But on another level ""Gladiator"" plays out like a remake of ""Fall of a Roman Empire"". But it's not in the script. It's in the mood set again by production. This other story is about the decline and death of classical Rome and its ideals. There is simple yet effective symbolism to express it, the play on dark and light and the sunrise-sunset arc. The movie starts with a battle at dawn, the way the Rome itself had once dawned, fighting. There is an ideal Roman hero, valiant and dutiful, there's a typical Roman villain, clandestine and scheming. Hero does his best in the light, the villain does his worst in the dark, whenever they swap environments during the movie they fail miserably. The story ends at sunset, symbolizing the end of the Empire itself, and although an uplifting speech is given at that point it is defeated by the setting sun.The feeling of the doom is constantly emphasized by melancholic music. The dreamlike experience of the main character who is already dead but doesn't yet know it is enhanced when he finally visits Rome and the city is an idealistic, blown in proportions version of itself. The script may be a complete falsification of history, but the feeling of decline one gets when watching those scenes is probably completely faithful.So forget the story and the closing speech. Watch and listen the movie. The Roman Empire is living and dying once more before your very eyes."
"I think Gladiator is really the best movie I've ever seen. Everything is just perfect, the image, the story and of course the music. The first time I saw the movie I was really overwhelmed by the movie. Than I rented it a dozen times before I could buy it. Since the time the movie came out I've seen him at least 30 times. And now I'm still overwhelmed by the feeling the movie gives me. It just the most perfect movie there is!!! The movie starts with a great opening, the only bad thing about the opening and maybe the whole movie is that when the soldiers fire the missiles you can see very good that this missiles are animated by a computer, they go to straight to be real. After that the movie starts slowly and keeps going faster till the end. Thats another reason why it is good. From the beginning till the end you just are watching as if you were there, this is meanly done by the music which fits perfectly by the pictures you see. Great work from Hans Zimmer just like the latest movie King Arthur."
"You have to watch this movie at least 3 times in your life: First time - in puberty for the special effects and epic battles. Like the little Lucius, this movie will likely make you to dream of being a gladiator.Second time - in your 30's for the love, life choices and loses. This is the time when you fight all your battles for yourself and your family. Like Maximus you will dream to get out of your Colosseum and break the chains.Third time - when you feel your life is close to an end - just to remember what you have achieved. Like the old emperor Marcus Aurelius you will have to realize if your name would be remembered or forgotten forever. Is your family close to you in your final hours or you are going to see them in the afterlife. Have you been a good parent?I really enjoy this movie every time I watch it."
"Probably one of the best movies I have ever seen.Every minute brings forth more intrigue to Gladiator. Non-stop action keeps the adrenaline pumping, the portrayal of the characters makes us see what the director and writer wants us to see, and a story that keeps us coming for more.Russell Crowe does an excellent job in his portrayal of Maximus, a man cut down from a general to a slave, and then became more powerful than the emperor, exactly as the tag-line says. His despair over the death of his family and the future he's denied, his disgust over the games, and his quest for vengeance when he finds the man who killed his family and his close friend.Joaquin Phoenix also does a marvelous job for Commodus. Successfully showing him as a spoiled rich boy lusting for more power, and viewing his as someone not to be feared, but pitied.Even though Oliver Reed died before he could shoot some very important scenes, they flawlessly brought him back from the dead digitally to say his final words, ""Shadows and Dust,"" from a test shoot earlier making the approach of the climax even more gripping.Alien, Blade Runner, and now Gladiator. What ever Ridley Scott does for these movies, he should keep it up and other directors should take notes."
"Perfection! Every single detail: from a perfect cast, to flawless acting, flawless script, the most ascetically amazing and magnificent sets of all time, costume design's are flawless, the directing and editing was absolutely brilliant: you can go frame by frame line by line detail to detail and you will not find any flaws. Even the greatest movies of all time have either a minor plot flaw, or someone does a bad acting job, or their was a casting flaw (someone who just stuck out your head that would be better for a certain part), their is almost always flaws in a certain scene's that could be improved upon or if you could go back in time and change certain things you would. In this movie there is not one single thing in that could be improved upon down to smallest of details. Their is are not any scene's, line's, setting, or expressions in the movie that could be improved upon. No other film has ever been this perfect on so many levels. If it was possible to go back in time and re-shoot this movie again and again starting with everything the same everything, the chances of everything being executed this perfect again are extremely slim for a film of this scale. This movie raised the bar as high as it can go and the bar cannot be raised any higher. Just like you cannot travel faster than speed of light this movie cannot be surpassed. The best any future movie can do is tie and chances of a future movie being this perfect are not very likely. You would have better chances of winning the LOTTO several times then to see another movie that is executed so perfectly in every way.You may enjoy another movie more, because of different factors like your favorite genre or you, somehow dislike some part of this movie for some strange reason like you are scarred of a little blood or violence. But no one could logically argue that any other movie has been developed and executed this perfectly."
"Their are no words to describe this grand historic epic. Gladiator is a film everybody would enjoy, for it has a great story, great action and superb acting (no wonder Crowe got an Oscar!) Gladiator recounts the story of one of the greatest Roman generals Maximus, who was forced to slavery by the corrupt incestuous heir to the throne Commodus (Phoenix) who killed Marcus Aurelius the emperor for he knew he offered Maximus power over his own son. Maximus has then become his worst enemy. Commodus having ordered to kill him and his family, Maximus escapes death and as becomes the general who became a slave, the slave who became gladiator, and the gladiator who defied an emperor. Gladiator has some of the most beautiful scenery and CGI effects I have ever seen. IT really is one of the best ""recent"" films out there. The script is also very effective and suiting, and somehow adds a poetic feel to it and so does the superb music used. The actors all did very well in their roles, though Crowe dominated, it is also a memorable performance by Phoenix and Nielsen most memorably and also Hounsou and Harris. Gladiator really does deserve all the awards and nominations it has received. I can assure you, that if you haven't seen this films yet, it should really be the next on your list!"
"This movie is one of the great true-to-the-human-heart movie. It has a good story and good ending. I enjoyed this movie so much that I recommended this movie to all my friends and even my teachers. Actually, my World Literature teacher liked it so much that she got permission to show it to our class. It has great actors in it as well. Joaquin Phoenix is hot and is perfect for the part of Commodus. He has the look and the acting attitude for the evil emperor. Russel Crowe is an awesome actor in anything that he is in. He also has his part down pat. I could not imagine anyone else playing the part of Maximus. I also like what Hans Zimmer did to the music for this film. I love the instruments and the word choices for the film. I am actually listening to the second soundtrack to the movie. I love the way the music reminds me of the different parts of the movie. I get the shivers just thinking about the ending music especially."
"Joaquin Phoenix is the perfect Roman Emperor for portraying any of the Roman Ceasars in a continuation of the mini series ""Rome"" or another movie about Emperor ruled Rome. The viewers loved the series Rome and would embrace seeing Joaquin Phoenix play Ceasar again. His demeanor, physical features, and intensity make him the perfectly credible Ceasar. Unforgettable, unmistakable regal presence.His portrayal of Commodus in The Gladiator proved this. Ceasar is the role that Joaquin Phoenix was born to play. Would be a serious mistake if a producer in Hollywood does not recognize this.Bring back Rome...and Joaquin Phoenix as Ceasar."
"The only thing that could be said about Gladiator, the last Ridley Scott's movie, is good entertainment.  But is not far from the scheme of the classical American action movie: the male protagonist, his revenge to obtain, the final duel with the villain.  The initial scene of the night battle promised other and higher emotions...By the way I was born in Rome and I live in Rome and the ancient Rome of the movie is not a good representation."
"Evaluating opinion of this movie by the 'Hated It' selection, I lost count of the number of contributors who gave it just one star. I thought they were being unnecessarily 'Roman' in their ruthlessness, but the result does show how disappointed so many viewers were and the extent to which this movie has polarised opinion.I diplomatically place myself somewhere in the middle.For me, scepticism set-in at the outset. That much-vaunted battle scene didn't sit right at all. In combat, the greatest Roman strength lay in the legion. The scrupulously drilled and disciplined foot-soldiers worked in unison, advancing upon enemies in their orderly units and maniples.Their Shields interlocked to create a mobile wall that could form-up on all flanks and even provide overhead protection. In between, they used their short, stabbing swords.The legions, then, were only at their best in the open. In dense forest, their advantages would have been squandered, any fight being a brawl upon the same terms as the enemy. Morover, their big Shields would have been an encumbrance and the short swords inadequate. A good Roman general drew the enemy out to fight on his terms, not the other way round. I'm not a scholar of Roman warfare; it may be there were occasions when Romans had no choice, but this is where the question marks began to pop-up. Check out the impeccable piece in 'Spartacus', where the Roman legions deploy by the textbook, drawing their enemy down from the hill. Perhaps Mr Scott felt that a more faithful rendering would seem like too much of a rip-off. In any case, this battle is quite incidental, and seems to exist only to grip the viewer's attention for the next couple of flatulent hours.Neither was I aware that the Roman army employed fire-bombs. It's not for me to say they didn't, but I have no reference to this tactic at all.I thought Ridley Scott made a futile attempt to create an 'arty' film. The frequent dream-like flashbacks to a hand running through spears of corn reminded me of the recurrent unicorn dream from his fascinating but equally pretentious 'Blade Runner'. From time to time there's even the same high-pitched warbling 'oriental' chorus, intended to project mood, but failing again. Some directors don't seem to realise that cinema-goers have memories.General Gruntus Maximus (Russel Crowe) surely got the easiest Oscar in history. He was believable as an uneducated slob in the way, perhaps, Spartacus should have been; but cerebral enough to be a general? I don't think so. And you don't rise to be a career general in an army whilst obsessing as a farmer about your harvest. You're either one, or the other.There was one particularly absurd scene in the arena when he was chopping-down competitors as quickly as they could be set against him. What then - weren't they trained gladiators, too? I was half-expecting him to begin walking sideways along the arena walls like 'Neo' from 'Matrixus'.As to the 'spectacle' of Rome; well, that was all just computer-generated hokum. The back-room boys can whip-up anything in that way now just by tapping a few keys, so what's the big deal? Check-out the 'real' thing in 'Fall Of The Roman Empire'.As with 'Titanic' and 'Pearl Harbour' a splendid opportunity was missed here to do something really wonderful, but because of flawed vision and misplaced directorial self-belief we finished up with mediocrity. Glorious mediocrity.Still, bread and circuses usually please the crowds."
"It's starts out like any good epic should with a masterfully filmed and executed exciting battle sequence that sets up the audience for one of those rare Hollywoodian confections that are both entertaining and artsy. Unfortunately, it all goes downhill from there. It isn't the performers faults since every single one of them give amazing, emotional, even, at times, riveting performances (the kinds you should find in better movies) and who give the whole picture more class than it deserves. It isn't Hanz Zimmer's nor Lisa Gerrard's fault since they have composed a score that's almost (and I do mean almost) as unforgettable as the Godfather's. And it certainly isn't Ridely Scott's fault since he yet again succeeds in immersing the audience in the world he has created. No, the ones who are to blame are the people who wrote the saccharine, clichéd, soap-opery script and who, in the process, have wasted all of this incredible talent. They should be fed to the lions. It's an entertaining B-movie that could have been a classic. Just like Titanic in a way."
"Historical epics used to be ""the thing."" Nobody is making Ben Hur today, but at least we have Gladiator. It has all the best aspects of the genre: a great hero, a nasty villain, a love story, huge crowds, dazzling locations, and strong music."
I like movie but him have some wrongs like the co2 tube under soldier or the airplane. Btw is a nice movie for 2000
"What can I say?  Gladiator was a great film.  It cunningly blends political satire, acting, action, and fun into to a film, right? WRONG.Gladiator is more than just a fun-filled, oscar-winning, controversial action-fest.  If you look below the surface, Gladiator has many facets of itself that makes a step above the rest.First, compliments to Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix (who was wrongly denied the Supporting Actor Oscar.)  One of the best examples of why this film is unusual is because of how varied and developed (or fleshed-out) the characters are.Another important thing to remember is that the film is not necessarily meant to be taken as a pinnacle masterpiece of the ages.  Though the film is portrayed quite artistically and has the ability to touch the audience on an emotional level, some scenes are just intended for fun (or shock value, whichever suits you best.)And so, though I haven't much to say for this one, I enjoyed, and its one that will make a small impression on the American public (emotionally, not economically.)"
"I too was very sceptical of this film. It looked like Braveheartwhich I hated. A Big macho fest that pumped up the killingaspect but I was Pleasantly surprised. An interesting character piece and I am glad I was proven wrong. I like tobe proven wrong if it's a good film. Russel Crowe shinesand Joaquin Pheonix, well what can I say except Wow. Heis living up to his Brothers name. Ridley Scott proves once again that he is one of the bestdirectors around and one of the most visual. So for all you sceptics, check it out; you might  be surprised."
"As a Roman History Buff, the ending destroyed it. You have the ending where the fictional Maximus kills Commodus (a real Roman Emperor) in gladiatorial combat. (Commodus was actually strangled in his bath when poison wasn't killing him fast enough.) The sister of Commedus, Lucilla (who had actually been executed at the beginning of Commedus' reign) announces that we are all going to honor Maximus and restore the Republic.For a Roman history buff, this is like saying World War II was Hitler giving us all Ice Cream.What actually happened was that after Commedus (who wasn't that bad of a guy, really) Rome went into an embarrassing period known as the ""Year of the Five Emperors, where a decent man was assassinated, the office of emperor was auctioned off, and three rival generals launched a civil war.This is universally agreed to be the tipping point of Rome's inevitable decline."
"The denizens of the Roman Empire were a particularly bloodthirsty lot, and apparently not that far off in mentality from our own culture. The vox populi, bored to the heavens with the multitudinous burdens inflicted on them by their government, seek escape in the mind-numbingly bland entertainment provided within the Colosseum. Gladiators fend for their lives against a series of uniquely dressed foes and beasts, all in the hope of winning their freedom. Everything about this testosterone-toned epic is meant to cater to a population who likes their filmed landscapes served to them WWF-style.Maximus (Russell Crowe) is a top army general in the army of Marcus Auerlius (Richard Harris), a dying patriarch who (in predictable fashion) unwittingly causes trouble within the family ranks by offering his throne to Maximus instead of to his son Commodus (Joaquin Pheonix). Auerlius' son is the kind of whinny, pussy-whipped boy that your audience likes to hate because the character's moral fiber makes the character so easily expendable. Commodus' temper tantrums lead to patricide and the film turns into an interminably messy three-hour affair simply centering on the standard theme of revenge.Maximus is sent to die in the woods but manages to get the upper hand and kill Commodus' henchmen. He returns to his homestead only to find his wife and son lynched from trees. Poor Maximus is denied the throne of Rome and is now being fueled to wage a one-man war against the sissy who wiped away his entire family. As Maximus works his way back to Rome, unbeknownst to the new king Commodus, our foppish king swishes around the kingdom ridiculously hitting on his sister Lucilla (Connie Nielson) and hovering inappropriately over his nephew Lucius (Spencer Treat Clark).In the first hour Ridley Scott has expertly painted his archetypal figures, forcing us to love the brave Maximus, wifeless and sonless, and hate the creepy teenager with the thirst for forbidden fruit. Maximus, once back in Rome, manages to enter a gladiator troop manned by one Proximo, the late Oliver Reed. This little group of circus freaks will provide Maximus with the proper cover through which he can maneuver himself into the hearts of Rome's people. Not only is the man driven by revenge but he is also cocky enough to believe that he has what it takes to accomplish the sort of feats no other gladiator has been able to accomplish. By his side is Juba (Djimon Hounsou), the proverbial Black voice of wisdom. If not for Will Smith's more unfortunately stereotypical role in Legend of Bagger Vance, this would have been the kind of role that would have garnered the deserved scorn of people like Spike Lee.For two hours, Scott inundates us with endless arena fireworks that would serve the acrobatics of the Rock and Hulk Hogan to a much better effect. The characterization of Crowe's character amounts to nothing more than a cocksure man, full of false bravado, whose only apparent skill is to raise his arm into the air and scream for his men to surge into battle. He is the kind of screen character who wages war against hundreds of foes within the course of a movie and manages to dispose of all of them with relative ease. He is also the kind of superhero archetype that garners the admiration of young boys like Lucius, something which causes our dear Commodus to go even further over the edge.Scott is to be admired in the end for at least not being a hypocrite, as he practices what he preaches. Since the citizens of Rome seem only to live for bloodlust, Scott manages to paint Gladiator as nothing else than that: entertainment geared for audiences whose sole interest is seeing men and tigers beat the s**t out of each other for three hours. But if this is all there was to the film then one would see little complaints from my person but Scott makes the mistake of filling his film with arty flourishes.The film opens with Maximus walking across a field, his hands slowly caressing tall blades of grass. These flashbacks, along with various cutaways to fast-moving skyscapes, amount to nothing more than pretentious attempts to add artistic credibility to an otherwise sophomoric film. Its as if he is aware of the fact that his film is devoid of any three-dimensional resonance that he tries to quickly interject soft touches of humanity into the proceedings. The end result is nothing less than visual illiteracy, ringing completely false and cowardly.When it comes to epics none come better than Tarkovsky's Andrei Rublev or Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky, two masterworks from Russia's greatest directors that fully captured the three-dimensional scope of war. The bad guys in these films, unlike the one played by Phoenix in Gladiator, are the kinds of foes whose selfishly malicious journeys are never cartoonishly drawn. The landscapes created by the Russian masters were poetic and grand, full of visual and emotional urgency. Scott's film is amounts to nothing more than being beat over the head by a club for three hours."
"This movie is the very epitome of what I hate about movies.  The Hollywood-ization/bastardization of what could have been a great movie. The FX and action were great, the characterization was adequate, the plot was dumb, and the ending was abysmal.  Why doesn't anyone in Hollywood have the courage to take a movie where it ought to go instead of where the test audiences say it should go?This is a gladiator movie.  You know what that means?  It was set during the Roman Empire.  During the reigns of Marcus Aurelius and his son Commodus. It was NOT a fantasy.  When you set a movie during a historical time frame, there are certain rules you have to abide by.  One of those is, you do not rewrite history on a grand scale.  The main reason to set a movie within a historical context is to give it plausibility.  You do not then crap on that plausibility by having the characters do things that would have caused all of history to lumber down a different path.In Braveheart, William Wallace did not rally the Scots, defeat the English, march into London, kill the king of England in a duel, and establish a democracy.  Why?  Because that isn't what happened; and it would have turned a great movie into a crappy movie.  In Dances With Wolves, John Dunbar does not rally the Sioux nation in a war to conquer the United States, kill Ulysses S. Grant in a duel, and establish a new form of government in Washington based on Sioux practices.  Why?  Because that isn't what happened; and it would have turned a great movie into a crappy movie.  In Gangs of New York, Leo DiCaprio's character did not face Abe Lincoln in an arena, kill him, and establish a new form of government in Washington where the Irish were the ruling class.  Why?  Because that isn't what happened; and it would have turned a mediocre movie into a crappy movie.
***SPOILER ALERT!!!***
So in Gladiator, an exiled Roman general kills the Emperor in the arena and in so doing allows the reestablishment of the Roman Republic in 182 A.D. You know what?  It didn't happen that way, and it turned a great movie into a crappy movie.  The makers of this movie took all the plausibility of setting and trashed it.  They took a pretty good historical action movie and turned it into a suck-ass fantasy.  And the better the movie is before the movie-makers pull their pants down and squat over it, the more I resent the dump being taken on it.  And that's the case here."
"If you know ANYTHING about the history of Rome, please do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie.Lets see: Film opening sequence. General Maximus speaks such nonsense about troops, casualties etc. The massive battle in the movie would have been fine if they didn't have archers or catapults in the scene. After that, they should have used the scene in ""braveheart"", instead of a film about Romans.Remember that Roman army didn't charge into combat without controlled formations? Not considering this fact, the battle is the BEST part of the film. After this incident, the plot of the movie is sooooo predictable, as if the manuscript had been written by someone with the imagination of 12 year old child.Actors then...I have only seen worse acting performed by mr. Sylvester Stallone than the Aussie playing the role of Maximus. Even a wooden log could have put more feeling into the scene when he finds his family slaughtered. Besides, he rode a huge journey in one day, came to the smoking ruins of his villa from a distance of 1000 klicks (try that yourself).And the final scene: Emperor challenging a gladiator into a duel, how stupid is that? This movie has the same value as a historical movie as Rambo III."
"This movie is one of the worst I've ever been forced to watch. I mean, I came out of the cinema and wondered why the sun wasn't already up. I thought it must have been at least 8 hours long. It's just so BORING! When you think about it, what happens in this movie? Tough guy kills some dudes. Tough guy talks about honour with old guy. Mean guy kills old guy. Tough guy kills some other dudes. Mean guy talks about honor with girl. Tough guy weeps for his family. Tough guy talks about honor with black guy, then kills some dudes. (Repeat last three lines until bored, and then some more). If they would have just stuck to the killing part, then it would have been a mediocre action film. But no, they had to add ""depth"" (=lots of ""philosophical"" (=clicheed) truisms, with about 30 seconds of pauses/reaction shots between sentences). Actually, the screenwriter packed the script with so many clichees he actually only missed one: Flavius (the nephew of the mean guy) is not Maximus's son. Bummer. I thought I knew everything that would happen after the first quarter of an hour.O.K. The good points: The first three fights or so ARE compelling (the other 20 or so cease to be). Ancient Rome never looked so real (Shame about the rest of the movie). The actors can act (their roles are just so clicheed the creators could have done with Muppets).One final question : Does Crowe really go from Germania to Spain in one day (Some horse that must be...), and from Spain to North Africa in another two? In a CART? I Refuse to have seen that. I must have fallen asleep for a few hours. It's possible with this movie. Zero stars."
"The old Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius wanted to give the power to his favorite general Maximus. Due to envy, Commodus killed his father Marcus and claimed him as the lawful successor. The misfortune fell on Maximus. After he lost his family, he did not want to live anymore. However life did not go on as he wanted. He was trained as a gladiator. It mattered life and death. If you wanted to survive, you had to kill the opponent.The final duel between Maximus and Commodus was the most soul-stirring duel I ever watched. Although Maximus was a powerful general, he was a kind and generous person. It was his kindness that made him become the victim of insidious Commodus. Maybe he was just fit for leading an army.Russell Crowe convincingly played the brave general Maximus. He was deserved to win the best actor (the academy award). It was a pity that Ridley Scott did not win the best director.A movie that can push you forward. 9/10"
"Regular readers of my comments note my penchant for pointing out that film is a modern medium, meaning that films -- good ones anyway -- are often largely about themselves. When the nature of this self-comment is interesting, I point it out. But I failed to do so in an earlier comment on Gladiator, so here is the remedy.Summer movies target the lowest of our sensibilities. The plots are highly simplified morality plays where good and evil are radically drawn; the form is of violent spectacle. In other words, our civilized society wants the same things we observe in later Rome, to which we insist on feeling superior.So the master Scott gives us a violent spectacle about a violent spectacle. He makes fun of us by pandering to our baser tastes while slyly getting us to agree with the wise senator who observes how simple, stupid and manipulable is the mob. He did much the same in Blade Runner, but there the comment was on the sharpness, complexity of the audience not its dullness.
Is this a maturing cynicism, an adventure into a new challenge (mastering the art of painting with a blunt palette), or a striking out against Hollywood's financial politics? I suppose we've have to wait a decade to find out -- until after the power-hungry Caesars die and the medium is returned to the enlightened leaders of the people."
"Firstly, Romans never referred to the Colloseum as the ""Colloseum"".  It was called the Flavian Amphitheatre.Commodus was an actual emperor who ruled from A.D. 180 to 192.  He did indeed fight in the Colloseum against gladiators, and was quite good at it because he never lost (Maybe he cheated like in the movie).His sister, Lucilla, did conspire with his wife Crispina to have him killed. They were caught and banished to an island and later killed.His mistress Marcia tried to drug him to death but failed, so they had some athlete strangle him to death.  He died on New Year's Eve A.D. 192.He was a nut case, and was quite murderous, but that's about the only things real about the movie.Other than the historical problems, the story was great.  I liked Maximus and really hated Commodus.  It was your basic struggle between good and evil."
"In the event of his death, ageing Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) intends to leave his trusted Hispano-Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius (Russell Crowe) in charge of Rome, instead of allowing his son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) to become his successor. Commodus has other ideas: he murders his father and orders Maximus to be executed. Maximus, not one to give up quietly, makes a daring escape, and, badly wounded, heads for home, where he discovers that his wife and son have been crucified on Commodus' orders. Passing out from the pain of his injury, Maximus is captured by slavers, nursed back to health and forced to fight as a gladiator. This new life eventually leads him to the Colosseum of Rome, where he finally comes face to face with the man who betrayed him.From director Ridley Scott, Gladiator is a historical epic to rival the classics from the 'golden age' of Hollywood. Opening in 180 A.D., with a brilliantly orchestrated battle between the Roman armies and the tribes of Germania, Scott's film grabs the viewer's full attention from the outset and doesn't let go until the end, having delivered an Oscar-winning central performance from Crowe, a memorable score by Hans Zimmer, excellent supporting roles from the likes of Harris, Phoenix, Connie Nielsen and Oliver Reed, and some of the most impressively bloody scenes of hand to hand combat ever filmed.If I were to choose my favourite scene, it would be the 're-enactment' of the battle of Carthage, a savage piece of action cinema in which Maximus and his fellow gladiators are ushered into the arena like cattle to the slaughter, only to turn the tables on their attackers, winning the hearts of the Roman masses in the process. A rousing, blood drenched spectacle, it's a fine example of Scott's expert direction, a masterclass in camera placement and movement, editing (the violence is extreme, but the film doesn't wallow in the gore), sound design and special effects, which still thrills even after all of these years."
"Watched one of All time Favorite Ridley Scott Films thats Gladiator one of my favorite Revenge/Sword & Sandals flick Films Featured an Amazing Performance from a Stellar Lead By Russell Crowe(L.A. Confidential ) as Maximus a former General Betrayed then turned Gladiator. Also Featuring the Late Richard Harris(Harry Potter and The Sorcerers Stone)as Emperor Marcus Aurelius ,Connie Nielson(Mission To Mars) as Lucilla, Derek Jacobi(Doctor Who) as Senator Gracchus, Djimon Hounsou (Amistad) as Juba Maximus close friend and confidant , Joaquin Phoenix(Walk The Line) as Commodus The films Main Villain. Scott does a brilliant job with STORY you feel the same rage as Maximus when you understand what he does after having his own friends turn on him simple because he wants to be with his family . Arguably crowes best film the story is filled with epic period spectacle when we go from the smaller arenas to the The roman the story also moves forward in a grand way amazing performance from Crowe as the Anger filled Maximus. Great Production design from Arthur Max(G.I. Jane) Period films aren't easy to do also fantastic costume design from Janty Yates(Welcome to Sarajevo) and Amazing Direction from Ridley Scott(Blade Runner). Gladiator is truly the best out of the Sword & Sandals Genre and a well deserved best picture. 9/10"
