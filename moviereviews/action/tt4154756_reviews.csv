"This movie is the beginning of the culmination of Marvel's masterfully woven cinematic universe. Beginning back in 2008 with iron man, we are finally seeing the results of all the movies have been pointing to; and it did not disappoint. Thanos is a complex villain, with deeper and more interesting desires than just ""world domination."" The dilemmas all the characters face in this movie (both the heroes and the villains) are truly thought provoking and leave you on the edge of your seat. No other set of movies has beeen so involved, so expanded, and encompassed so many story lines/characters and previous movies. The sheer amount of star power alone in this film is insane; and they do a masterful job of weaving all these unique and various characters into a common storyline."
"Over the past decade, Marvel has earned itself the benefit of the doubt. The studio has consistently delivered smart, funny, brave films that both embrace and transcend their comic-book origins. The 18 blockbuster movies produced since Iron Man first blasted off into the stratosphere in 2008 have not only reinvented superhero films as a genre - they've helped to legitimise it. Indeed, Marvel's two most recent films - Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther - have received the kind of accolades usually reserved for edgy arthouse flicks. And yet, it's perfectly reasonable to be apprehensive about Avengers: Infinity War. This is a blockbuster film that's been ten years in the making, its plot hinted at and scattered throughout 18 other movies. It features 30 or so characters, each with their own complex backstories and motivations. And all of them are coming together in a bid to stop a giant purple alien dude from destroying the universe. It sounds ridiculous, and feels impossible. But that's precisely what makes the final product such a monumental achievement. Masterfully directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, Infinity War is bold, brainy filmmaking at its very best: the kind that will lift your spirits, blow your mind and shatter your soul - occasionally in the same scene. It demonstrates on an epic scale what Marvel has known all along: that special effects and tightly choreographed action are there to serve the story. For all its blockbuster spectacle (and there's almost too much of that), the film works because it's anchored by the heart, humour and humanity of its characters.The film's basic plot is simple: Thanos (played via motion-capture by Josh Brolin), intergalactic purveyor of death and destruction, has long been on the hunt for the six Infinity Stones that will give him complete control over the elemental building blocks of the universe. He dispatches his acolytes to Earth to retrieve the Time Stone, currently in the possession of Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and carve the Mind Stone out of the forehead of Vision (Paul Bettany). It's a literal existential threat so terrifying that all the heroes we've come to know and love - from the Avengers to the Guardians of the Galaxy - must put aside their differences and unite against a common foe. From the outset, it's immediately clear that neither the film's directors nor screenwriters (Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) are interested in playing it safe. Most other superhero films are bled of high stakes - the hero in the title might suffer untold trauma, but it's a super-safe bet that he or she will make it to the end alive. There's no such guarantee here. Within the first ten minutes, we are confronted with the dark, twisted depths to which Thanos and his acolytes in the Black Order will sink in order to achieve their goals. Death, as well as genuine loss and sacrifice, is intrinsic to the narrative drumbeat that drives Infinity War ever forward, and the film is all the better for it. That's not to say the movie is a morbid and depressing experience. What's so impressive about Infinity War is how it expertly juggles its constantly shifting tones and moods. When it's funny (and it very often is), it's deeply, truly funny. The film finds maximum joy in flinging characters together with merry abandon, mixing and matching ones you'd never have expected to share scenes or trade banter. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is floored by Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) godly muscles. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) is charmed by the wit and intelligence of Shuri (Letitia Wright). And it'd be impossible to not be utterly delighted by Peter Dinklage's inspired cameo. It's a blithely tongue-in-cheek sensibility shared by Marvel's best comic books, which understand that humour can make you care when it really counts.And, boy, does Infinity War make it count. There are many heartbreakingly human moments threaded throughout the film: from the charming surrogate father-son dynamic shared by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Peter Parker (Tom Holland), to the undeniable love that ties Vision and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) together. In many ways, the film stands as a testament to the human capacity not just to love, but to love fiercely and beyond all logic. It's right there when the unfailingly noble Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) declares, ""We don't trade lives"", even when giving up one could save billions. There's even a chilling echo of it in Thanos himself. A lesser film would have turned Thanos into a one-dimensional villain, much the way he's all monster and maniac in the comic books. In Infinity War, however, Thanos' end goal is surprisingly relevant when it comes to thinking and talking about the staggeringly overpopulated world in which we live today. There is, as it turns out, method to Thanos' madness. It makes the tragic twists and turns in his relationships with his estranged adopted daughters, Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Nebula (Karen Gillan), all the more unsettling. For the most part, Infinity War does justice, too, to the many heroes who have been assembled for the film. The Russo brothers displayed great skill at interweaving multiple perspectives and character trajectories in Captain America: Civil War, and they do so again here, with twice as many characters. Even the most minor of supporting players, like Don Cheadle's James Rhodes/War Machine, are given story beats that land. It helps that Marvel has always taken care to cast genuinely good actors in roles that might otherwise come off as silly and slight. Even so, there are a few standouts amongst this enormous and enormously talented cast. Emotionally speaking, this is Downey's film. He plays every note of Tony's reluctant courage and bone-deep trauma, as he embarks on what he's convinced is a suicide mission. He's ably matched by Cumberbatch, who finds vulnerability even in his character's most cunning and calculative move. Hemsworth, meanwhile, is given free rein to import the big-hearted comedic swagger of Thor: Ragnarok into this film - while also layering it with a deeply-felt, jagged grief for the losses he has suffered at the hands of Thanos and the universe.In a film with so many moving parts, some elements don't work quite as well. A couple of characters that you might have expected to be right at the forefront - including an original Avenger or two - fade into the background. The film tumbles from dizzying fight scene to dizzying fight scene, and while most of them are fantastically choreographed, there are some purely dumb moments that literally revolve around attempts to prevent Thanos from clenching his fist. In effect, this is a superhero mêlée that's part over-the-top and part overkill, and might prove too much for those who don't already care for this franchise and the characters in it.Minor quibbles aside, though, Infinity War is yet another step in the right direction for Marvel. It continues the studio's tradition of placing a premium on rich, complex storytelling that respects both its characters and its audiences. But it also refuses to make things easy for itself. The film ends even more bravely than it began, with a final ten minutes that will haunt and horrify you in equal measure. It's a stroke of bold, brilliant genius - a narrative risk so audacious that you'll want to follow Marvel wherever it goes next."
"This film is way better than endgame!
The actions better
The writings better
The dialogues better
The cgi is better
More shocks and more emotional.
Watching both in the cinema , the reactions to this in cinema was unbelievable compared to endgame. Dont get me wrong endgame is good but to say its the best marvel film is jus marvel fan boys being stupid.
I just dont see how people are saying endgame is the best marvel film when theres clearly other marvel films better than it!
But trust me this is the film that changed the mcu , lol maybe it because i wanted them to lose because thanos is badass!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Summer movies often hype themselves as spectacular events not to be missed and their ad campaigns use words like ""epic"", ""spectacle"", and ""smash"" as ways to build the hype to increase advanced box office sales.
The summer 2018 film season kicks off in a big way with ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and it is the rare summer film that exceeds is lofty expectations and delivers a crowning achievement for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
When Thanos (Josh Brolin), embarks on a deadly campaign to find and possess the Infinity Stones, he leaves a path of death and destruction in his path. When his pursuit leading him to Earth, Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), who enlist a reluctant Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), to the cause just as the minions of Thanos arrive.
With The Avengers fractured and scattered following the events of ""Captain America: Civil War"" the teams find themselves dealing with the threat in various groups as fate steps in to divide many key members of the team. This allows for a great entry by the Guardians of the Galaxy and allows the film to take a very enjoyable path. Essentially the movie weaves separate storylines into one cohesive and very satisfying epic. You have a story with the Guardians as well as one with many of the key Avengers, as well as others with characters old and new. As such it is like a Guardians, Avengers, and Marvel film all rolled into one and each one supports the other very well yet has the charm and identity you would expect. While the tone is very dark as you would expect with literally half of the known universe facing destruction, there is also some solid humor in the film that never once undermines the story or pacing.
Naturally the effects are stunning as you would expect as Marvel has put a significant amount of money into the film and it shows in every eye-popping action sequence.
What really impressed me the most was that the Russo Brothers never let the FX of the film overshadow the characters and with a very large cast, it was nice to see everyone got their moment and you did not see members of the cast trying to one up each other.
There are some real surprise moments along the way and the action is easily the best of any Marvel film to date. Many fans had expressed disappointment with ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" for me this film is significantly better than the prior film and is everything that a Marvel fan would want in a film.
I was also surprised by how well Thanos was portrayed as while you hopefully will not agree with his deductions and methods; you could actually understand his motivations and it help him transcend from the usual megalomaniacs which are so common in films of his type. I am really looking forward to seeing what comes next and make sure you stay through the credits for a bonus scene.
Believe the hype, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is an epic not to be missed and is an example of what a summer event film should be.
5 stars out of 5"
"I was amazed to see so many negative reviews; so many people are impossible to please. This movie was 2 1/2 hours long, but I could have sat there another 2 1/2 hours and not noticed. Thoroughly entertaining, and I love how the directors weren't afraid to take chances. I've read a lot of other user reviews that claim that there's no plot. Unless you're mentally handicapped or not paying attention because you're on your phone the entire movie, the plot is pretty clear, and decent in my opinion."
"All the reviews that say this movie has no plot are either trolls, idiots, or didn't are to take the time to watch previous marvel movies. Every single one of those ratings and reviews should be taken down and not added to the rating for Infinity War because of their fundamental lack of understanding. It's like coming in and watching the last 2 minutes of an hour long drama show and saying this episode sucks because it has no plot. It's utterly ridiculous!There have been 31 marvel movies leading up to this point. All 31 has have some plot that leads to infinity war. Infinity War IS the end game movie. There is nothing left to explain, nothing left to discuss, it is all-out fight for control of the most powerful items in existence, the infinity stones. There have been 31 movies to explain in someway the power of these stones and/or the heroes that come together to fight Thanos in this movie. It's like a long game of chess where Thanos finally makes his move, and it's a huge one.So I beg of any of you who reads this. Don't listen to anyone who says this movie has no plot, has no reason and is only fighting. They aren't worth listening to, Infinity Wars has roughly 60 hours of plot from 31 precious movies leading up to this monumental fight for life or death, and the movie is done to near perfection. The movie is glorious, the CGI is fantastic, the battles are awe-inspiring, and Thanos is made worth of your fear from the very beginning. He is truly the Mad Titan that captures your heart and crushes it right in front of your eyes. Anyone who doesn't think this clearly didn't see the same movie."
"I absolutely loved this movie. It was intense, action-packed and emotional. Also delivering comedy when needed, but it was a relatively dark film. All of the actors delivered great performances and the characters continue to be fleshed out and be made human despite the fact that they're superheroes. This is easily the best superhero movie ever made. Thanos is one of the best villains of the MCU, as well as one of the best of Cinematic history in general. Upon first viewing, I hated him, but found his character intriguing. Similar to Emperor Palpatine in the Original and Prequel trilogies of Star Wars. The more times I rewatch it though, I start to understand Thanos' point of view more and more. The blurred lines with his motivations make the movie more compelling. Even driving some people to say that Thanos was right in all this. I wouldn't go that far, but I would say his character is misunderstood. Definitely a compelling villain in Thanos. The ending of the movie was insanely emotional, but I love how they (mainly) set aside the original Avengers team to take on Thanos in the fourth Avengers movie. I, for one, cannot wait.That eerie ""Thanos will return"" at the end of the film sent a chill down my spine. It truly is the end game now, and I can't wait to see the Avengers rise up and likely defeat Thanos in the next movie.+Every Hero has their moment to shine (Much like the villain wants, the movie achieves balance in this way)
+Good Comedic moments to balance (again pun intended) the dark tone of the film
+Emotional and Heavy ending (Seeing Earths Mightiest fail is something devastating to watch)
+Complete hype moments that reward you for being a fan of this franchise for 10 years
+Incredible performances
+Phenomenal original score 
Etc. Not much you can find that's wrong with this movie. It's literally the perfect movie Marvel has been building up to for 10 years. And those that claim it didn't have an ending as a negative, I beg to differ. Just because the villain won doesn't mean it didn't have an ending. My Rating: 10/10"
"I went and looked, and I want to express my thoughts.I went to this film with very high expectations, with a sense of something. I went to him twice, the first time, myself, and the second with the family, and I was even surprised that my mother, sister and dad (who do not understand this movie at all) brought unreal pleasure and an ocean of emotions.Each frame, each scene does not let you get bored, from the Marvel logo, and to the stage after the credits. Favorite heroes once again experienced side by side and you feel it, you are completely absorbed in a hurricane of events and you are watching it in one breath. In comparison with the War of Infinity, even the Confrontation looks like an ordinary fight in the sandbox.Uuuu, and the villain, the best as for me the best in this kirovoveselennoy, he is not just a bot at once, without motivation, no, it's just the opposite. I liked Thanos so much that you do not want to, and he began to impress me, in terms of his convictions (I had it only once, with Joker Heath Ledger). He has feelings, he makes choices, he's alive.Tense scenes are beautiful, in one moment I still let off a meager male tear (and this happens to me very, very rarely). What about the humor, the jokes are correct for me, and they do not bother you like Thor: Ragnarok, although in the beginning they look a little tight. Well, the action, it is very high-quality, and in comparison with the Black Panther is generally ideal.And of course the film can not be without punctures. The lack of predictability of some story lines, and a couple of moments that were very predictable, but they are fade against the background of all this scale.Yes, you will not find anything in this film about something, something, but, what, what, what, steep humor. Thanks to Marvel and of course the Rousseau brothers, the beautiful actors and the wonderful movie that I've been waiting for for 3 years.Out of 10, I give the War of Infinity 9."
"Engrossing, Epic, Emotional. Those are the three E's that define this movie. The latest instalment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise is at its very best, culminating ten years of marvel adventure and spectacle with the biggest and most boldest movie in the superhero genre. 
So let's start with Anthony and Joe Russo, the geniuses that made this beast of a movie. After announcing that they will be directing the next two Avengers movies, Marvel fans knew at once that this will be the darkest Avengers movie yet. Yes, it was very dark with more of a serious tone. More than Winter Soldier and Civil War (previous marvel movies directed by the Russo Bothers) combined but they also had what the other Avengers movies had as well, the humour and it was not at all tasteless. Nobody really cared if it was necessary or not because the humour worked along with the edgy parts of the movie. This is by far the Russo brothers best work among the Marvel movies completely raising the bar of superhero movies to it's highest. Praise to Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for writing the amazing script (they also wrote the scripts of Captain America, The Avengers, Winter Soldier, Age of Ultron and Civil War also known to be the best marvel movies). 
Now, the characters and story. Practically everyone that you've seen in the previous marvel movies that aren't dead, are in this movie. Everyone had the chance to shine even if it's the smallest way possible. There were so many character arcs in this movie and none of them were cut short or boring. Every scene is in the movie was worth digesting and deciphering, along with the surprises and the twists and turns that will get audiences on the edge of their seat. Everything from character development to the pacing of the storyline, makes you jump, scream, gasp or cry. 
And of course, the one and only, Thanos. The villain that has been teased one too many times is finally here and he delivers. Josh Brolin officially portrays the best villain in the MCU, completely pissing on Marvel's villain problem. He brings all out on the table with everything he's got. Not only will you hate Thanos by the end of the movie, but you will understand him and maybe even feel sorry for him for a few seconds. They brought layers into him that no one has seen in a movie portrayal of a Marvel villain. They made him scary and strong at the same time vulnerable and understandable. The motivation of his doing and his character development made him the best character in the movie, making the movie all about him. 
I cannot tell you anymore about this movie because then I would be spoiling. All I have to say is that whether you're a marvel fan or not, and if you at least know what has been going on in the previous marvel movies, GO AND WATCH IT. It will not be a waste of your time or money. Digest this to prepare for what's to come. I may be bias once again but I just have to. I have to rate this movie 10/10. If I don't, I would be betraying myself."
"Well, Well, Well....I was so ready to tear this down - 19th MCU film, too many stars, bloated CGI, first of a two parter, and so on and so on...Yet, this is so much fun. Pure popcorn...now in the dictionary under ""popcorn film"" is just the poster for this film. Somehow, the Russo Brothers have juggled all the parts to give everyone some time in the sun. They are helped immensely by two things: the premise is so pure Mcguffin that you just watch Thanos look for Infinity Stones which gives a primal momentum and that the film's stars/characters are looking to move on - that means, actual stakes for once as people could really die and not just comic book dying either.The DC people must be kicking themselves. The lightness and comedic touches are brilliant. You are laughing out loud, comedy level, but at totally organic character humour. It means you are so entertained throughout its rather long running time.The other big surprise is Thanos himself. Normally, I hate CGI characters but somehow they have made Thanos and Josh Brolin work enough to give the character an actual arc. This is one of the better MCU villains and I never thought I would write that.The stakes are real, the charisma levels are amazing, it is like ""Oceans 28"" and I can't wait for the sequel...that says an enormous amount considering the challenges this film faced."
"Oh. My. God. What an incredible film! I've never done a review of a movie before, I've only done TV shows. So bare with me, I'm gonna discuss the major points and chuck in a theory or two. But to start off...Wow. This film could be the best Marvel movie ever! But I will give it a few days to digest and probably a second viewing before deciding on that. It absolutely lived up to the 10 year build up since Iron Man 1, how far we've come in a quick 10 years is remarkable. The Thanos character absolutely hit the mark. He was menacing, intimidating, vicious and so much more. Props to the actor who played him. Thanos' plan succeeds (for the time being) and we get a whole lot of ""death"" because of it. In this movie there was death, and ""death"". The former refers to characters such as Loki, Vision and Gamora. We saw these characters die and there bodies be left behind. For this movie not to lose credibility, these characters, in my opinion, must remain dead. Now ""death"" refers to what we saw at the end, Thanos, with all infinity stones, clicked his fingers and half of humanity, including half of the avengers (important to note that all the original avengers are still alive) dissolved into dust giving the impression of death. I expect these characters to come back at some point during the next Avengers film, most likely due to the originals saving them. My final theory regards Doctor Strange. On the ship with Stark and Spidey, Strange said that if it came to it he would save his stone over Stark and Spidey's lives. However, in the end we see Strange give up the stone to Thanos on the condition Stark stay alive. My prediction is that when Strange saw all the possible futures, the only future in which they win must heavily rely on Tony Stark. Which makes sense, Tony started it all so he should finish it. Incredible film, can't wait for the next one to see how it all resolves. 9.8/10"
"I consider myself a big comic book marvel fan. My favorite films from the franchise so far, are Cap. American: Winter Soldier and Thor: Ragnarok. As this movie was directed by the same guys as Winter Soldier and Civil War, I went into this movie with sky-high expectations. I am gonna keep this brief: Avengers: Infinity War blew me away! If I should mention just one thing that really amazed me was the character of Thanos. He is so well developed and makes for a super interesting and complex villain. As an audience, we are actually capable of sympathizing with a guy, who wants to kill off half of the universe. It's not about power or dominance. It's about preserving life in a Universe with finite resources - a goal with leads him (and the avengers) into several interesting moral dilemmas. I agree with the other reviews here. This movie is such a beautiful calamity of 10 years of the best superhero entertainment there is. Thinking about it, I can't really grasp how the director pulled this off. So many well developed characters from different story lines are working together in a true cinematic symphony. I give this movie my highest recommendations. It's a must-see for anyone with just a remote interest in the franchise."
"This movie has made me feel things that I haven't about a movie in a very long time. If you are anything like me you will definitely feel a sense of ""everything is gonna be alright"" because of the generous sprinkling of light humour that makes the situation feel less serious than it actually is. The emotional roller coaster that begins right at the beginning of the movie to the very end has you feeling more and more frustrated and on edge as it goes on. Don't get me wrong this movie is absolutely stunning and amazing and a cliffhanger at the end has you wanting more and more. I'm definitely very excited to see how this storyline will carry out in the next Avengers movie."
"I don't mean to be negative here, but Avengers: Infinity War's 8.9 on IMDb is entirely undeserved. Marvel superfan or not, this movie has nothing on films like The Dark Night, La La Land, Pulp Fiction, or Inception, all films which it either outranks based on it's 8.9 rating or comes close to. I get that there was an insane amount of hype around this film, and it's awesome to see our favorite Marvel characters come together (The Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor, Spiderman, Captain America, Black Panther, etc.), but we shouldn't let our excitement over all of our favorite characters coming together cloud the fact that ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is an overly long movie that relies on cheap, unbelievable deaths to generate excitement and that isn't particularly well written or edited. I commend the directors and writers on being able to successfully interweave so many stories, but the movie just felt too long. It's fight scene after fight scene, and while the performances are good and the script is pretty funny, the film isn't really original and its only redeeming factor is that it's full of characters we all know and love. It's funny to see Thor poke fun at the Guardians of the Galaxy and to see Iron Man and Spiderman interact with Doctor Strange, but when we look at the film objectively, it's really just a standard superhero film (with more superheroes than normal) that relies on cheap plot twists to generate excitement and emotion. No matter how much we love Marvel, we all know that there's no way any of the characters who ""died"" are actually going to die. The filmmakers expect us to believe that Black Panther (who just made Marvel over one billion dollars), Spiderman, and the Guardians of the Galaxy have all met the end of their respective stories, even when there are publicly announced sequels for all three franchises. I hate to say it, but all the character deaths at the end are just there for shock value, and it's cheap. From a technical perspective, the fight scenes are directed well, but that's about it. The editing isn't particularly great and the film feels too long at 2 hours and 40 minutes. I feel like half of the time spent hopping from planet to planet could have been cut and the movie would have been about as good if not better. OVERALL: ""Avengers: Infinity War"" could have been amazing, but it's too long and relies on cheap deaths to generate hype. This film is not deserving of it's 8.9 rating on IMDb. I think that Captain America: Civil War was a *much* better movie.6.5 out of 10."
"This movie was an underwhelming, chaotic blend of several different movies. I'm going to break down several of the different elements of the movie and why they either worked or really did not work. I'll start with the villain:Thanos, as a whole, is a pretty good villain. He is intimidating and the movie gave him a good script. The problem is that his powers are so freakin inconsistent. Guardians of the Galaxy already established just how powerful infinity stones are, but Infinity War seems to forget that. In the battle on Titan, Iron Man and about five others are able to hold Thanos down and nearly get his gauntlet off. At this point, Thanos has four infinity stones. Sorry, but there is no way they could restrain him at that point.  Infinity War also includes four other villains which the directors apparently felt had no need for an introduction. Collectively, they are called the Black Order (or dark order) and their names are never said so, I'll give them nicknames. There is Noseless the Terrible(who is terrible), Avatar Lady with Horns (also terrible), Rock Dude (basically Korg but bigger with a goatee), and Guy with Pointy Axe. The only people who understand who the heck these characters are, are Marvel comic fans. The biggest problem with Infinity War is the character developments and inconsistencies. I'll describe the worst cases:Star-Lord: When the first Guardians of the Galaxy came out, Star-Lord was a great character. Infinity War completely ruins him. He turns into a jealous jerk and an actual idiot. There are brief flashes of the old Star-Lord but mostly he is just a character that you despise. At one point during the battle on Titan (Thanos's home planet), Iron Man, Doctor Strange, and the Guardians of the Galaxy have Thanos held down and they nearly remove his gauntlet (which makes no sense in the first place because at this point Thanos has four feakin infinity stones). As they are removing the glove from Thanos's hand, Star-Lord finds out that Thanos killed Gamora earlier in the movie. 
Star-Lord then starts punching him and this wakes him up from Mantis's mind powers and this time he demolishes them before going on to destroy half the galaxy. Vision: The development of Vision is also really, really bad. In Age of Ultron he is strong enough to wield Thor's hammer but in Infinity War, he has developed and updated to the point that he never wins a single fight against anyone because it fits the plot. Thor: So in Thor: Ragnarok it was established that Thor is the god of thunder and doesn't need a hammer to be powerful. Then in Infinity War they completely forget this and make him get tossed around like a ragdoll. In fact, he never even uses his lightning abilities until he forges his new weapon. Did the directors forget about what got established in Ragnarok or did they just make Thor weak because once again it fits the plot and Marvel can get away with whatever the heck they want?Scarlet Witch: Wow! Her character was inconsistent. One minute she is getting demolished by some dark order member and the next she is holding off Thanos (who has five infinity stones at this point) for an extended period of time. Once again her powers are only as powerful as the directors need them to be for any given scene. Hulk: So apparently the Hulk is now scared to come out? Ahh, poor little guy. This is a terrible plot twist and really doesn't make much sense. Another thing that did not work about this movie was the sheer amount of characters. I was worried that it might be too many and it was. As a result, there were too many different subplots going on and they couldn't even have one final battle. They had to have two climactic battles going on at one time and the result was a bloated mass of CGI filled action for the last forty-five minutes of the movie. Now, I'll discuss the action in the movie by rating each of the major battles with a brief description:New York battle: 2/10 This battle was absolutely terrible. Noseless the Terrible comes in with the Rock Dude and tears up the city to take Doctor Strange away and nothing about the action is even slightly thrilling. The action in Alicia Vikander's Tomb Raider was better than the action in this battle.Wakanda battle: 8/10 This battle was actually pretty thrilling with great background music and some really cool action. The first half of this battle is a lot better than the second though. It also gets annoying because it's only fed to you in short segments while flashing back to the battle on Titan or Thor forging his hammer-axe-thingy. Overall though, this battle was good and part of the reason that I give Infinity War a 6 and not something much lower.Battle on Titan: 6/10 While, there is some good action in this battle, there are also a ton of inconsistencies revolving around Thanos and how powerful he is. Overall, I wasn't super impressed.I also need to discuss Thanos's plan for a second. He wants to wipe out half of the universe's population because the universe is overcrowded. Then he can finally rest. Did he think of the fact that the universe will repopulate again and all his hard work will be for nothing? I definitely prefer a storyline that involves the threat of total destruction of earth. Finally, I am going to discuss the characters that are killed in the movie and why it makes Avengers 4 really predictable. So at the end of the movie, Thanos snaps his fingers with all the infinity stones and half of the universe is killed. Somehow by random selection, all the original avengers survive. The odds of that happening are 1 in 64 assuming Hawkeye survived the dreaded finger snap of Thanos or 1 in 32 if he died while having his epic gaming session with friends (guess he got bored of the whole avengers thing). The characters that die are almost all new characters like Black Panther, Spiderman, Doctor Strange, etc. Several of these characters already have planned sequels so we know they are going to come back when the original Avengers find a way to time travel and reverse everything. It's just too predictable.Overall, Infinity War was not a very good movie. I do not understand the hype. It was choppy, inconsistent, overcrowded and overall just not the great movie it's cracked up to be. I would not recommend going to the theater for this one. I left feeling exhausted and tired of the MCU."
"Infinity War is a astonishing film which serves as the culmination of everything that occurred in MCU since the first pictures. Would seem, the movie had to turn out obscure and overloaded, but screenwriters so skillfully bring one moment to another that the movie bewitches with the first until the last minute. ""War"" connects those who didn't know about existence of each other, divides the teams which developed in the past, transfers characters from one region of the Galaxy in another, accompanying everything with grandiose battles. At the same time the narration remains clear and fascinating. Of course, if you've watched the previous movies. It's not a movie for those who want to get acquainted with Captain America, Thor, Hulk and other famous characters. The film is shot for fans, and the better you know the MCU story, the you derive bigger pleasure from viewing."
"Infinity War does a brilliant job by seamlessly combining the last few films together. It picks up where Ragnarok left off on the space shuttle with Thor, Loki, Hulk and all the remaining Asgardians. It opens with a distress call as Thanos and his Dark Order have slaughtered most of passengers including some of the remaining Asgardians. He interrogates Thor and beats Hulk so bad he is too scared to ever turn green again. A defeated Hulk/Bruce Banner is then transported to Doctor Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum so he can warn him of Thanos' arrival. It is down to Doctor Strange, Wong, Tony Stark and Spider Man to prevent Thanos' evil minions from destroying New York and taking the time stone. It's a thrilling action sequence that introduces Starks cool new nano-bot armour that creates its own swords and shields. Thanos has been teased since 2012 and the wait has paid off here as he is by far one of the best villains. The story is more about him achieving his goals which is refreshing to see as the villains are normally sidelined in these films. He is so determined to get all six gems, each gem making him stronger. The Avengers and Guardians have to race against time to stop him from finding all six. One sequence on his home planet 'Titan' is worth mentioning and like most of the film, it is breathtaking and tense. His crew (Dark Order) also seem unbeatable as they battle the rest of the Avengers in Wakanda with their alien army which also proves difficult. Thanos gets some interesting backstory, it would have been even better if the menacing Dark Order got some backstory themselves as we never really understand them or their motivations.Even though it enters familiar ground, it is often done differently and most of the time it's unpredictable. It's full of surprises and twists which will leave you exhausted by the end. Although Infinity War feels over stuffed with characters and storylines, the Russo Brothers do an exceptional job by giving each character enough to do. Its great to see some focus on characters like Gamora and Thor as previous films have kept it prominently on characters Iron Man, Hulk and Captain America. That's not to say they don't get anything to do because they do, it's just not as much as usual. This entry really does require you to see all of the ones before it as it can become confusing. They often call back to previous events and storylines, so it's a better experience if you are familiar with all of them. There are also so many fun references like Rocket Racoon's need for artificial limbs, Thor's new haircut and Drax's constant quips. There are too many visual effects shots which could have been avoided using practical effects. The CGI shots don't look bad, but sometimes they can be distracting. However it's a technique that is quicker than any other, and with studio films of this scale that's just a small price to pay. The action scenes are so well directed accompanied by a music score by Alan Silvestri who always adds that extra level of excitement to them. It is a relief to say Infinity War runs well over 2 hours 30 minutes which is the longest Marvel film. There is no point saying its ""baggy"" or ""overlong"" as fans of the franchise will greatly appreciate this and with so much going on the runtime is justified."
"Let me be clear Infinity War is not flawless, it has its faults but thankfully they are overshadowed by two hours of awesomeness.Every movie in the Marvel universe for the last decade has ultimately been building up to this therefore expectations were through the roof and for the most part it delivers.Almost every character from the MCU teams up to face its most dangerous foe yet, the mad titan himself Thanos and if you know anything about the comics then going in you'd know to brace yourself for heartache.With all the hype as to who wouldn't survive the film I'm left wondering just how many deaths are permanent, this is a superhero universe after all so never say never.Though the story and Thanos's motivations differ from the comic this can be forgiven as the new story is wafer thin but competent.As you can imagine one of the most exciting things about Infinity War was uniting heroes we've never seen side by side and that certainly delivers on all fronts. The action is thick and fast, despite the dark overtone we have plenty of comedy and teenage Groot didn't ruin the film like I feared he would.Obviously this is not a big finale and merely a high profile chapter in a much larger story but the movie is highly climatic regardless.I am saddened that this wasn't a two parter, alike Civil War (2016) this was a huge story and perhaps should have been broken up across movies.Infinity War is a contender for the best Marvel movie and instead of feeling burnt out after the never ending stream of films this has wet my appetite for more and I can't wait for the next film.Excellent stuff, though where in the blue hell was Ant Man?The Good:Children of ThanosThanosAll out action as expectedTies everything together nicelyThe Bad:Peter Dinklage (Never thought I'd say that)So many characters were spread too thinThings I Learnt From This Movie:If Thanos and Cable ever meet its going to be super weirdDishonest footage/photos are commonplace now (Look up the footage of Hulk in Wakanda running with the rest of the team) Seriously, never happened.Somewhere out there right now are DC fans claiming this is a bad film"
"The most anticipated movie of 2018 has now been released and my word, I have to say that Infinity War was brilliant on each scale, whether be its story, Visual Effects and the ensemble cast consisting all the Marvel characters. Every Marvel Fan needs to watch the movie as words cannot describe the magnificience of the movie."
"With the beggining of the movie it was full of surpises. 
What I really liked in the movie was the serious tone and the real threat hanging over the Avengers. Yes...this is THANOS ! He is an amazing villain ! 
MARVEL Studious show us once again that their production are spectacular visual!"
"Just WOW , The Russo nailed it, hand down from me they did it again. Part by part is interesting to watch , some of scene make me shock some scene make me wanna punch people so bad. Thanos is the best villain I've ever seen. He not just normal villain to kill bunch of people because he love but his motivation so clear why he wanna do that and most people know he is collecting all the infinity stones. One of the best part of it the team up Guardian & Avengers just amazing, full of humor cannot stop laughing watching their scene together. For 1st time my brain cannot process what going to happen in Avengers 4 really hype about it.Really worth watching it , if u non Marvel fans or superheroes fan this movie is worth to watch , really enjoy it . Of course every good movie always have some issue with it but just MINOR issue can close eye and let it go. Going to watch it again soon . Love from Malaysia."
"Infinity War is the same predictable mediocre flick for children as usual, only one that's too big for its own good.The previous team-up movies had a generic structure: some unmenacing bad guy arrives so the heroes have to unite - the heroes do unite, but the bad guy seems to take the upper hand - the heroes regroup and defeat the bad guy. Since IW was planned as two movies (more movies = more cash, not like there's some story to be told here), the structure is split between them, so the first one ends with the heroes seemingly defeated. But since we know that a sequel releases literally next year, the many character deaths feel cheap and pointless, kind of like that of Superman in BvS. And there are way too many heroes to give everyone proper screen time and things to do anyway.There's literally nothing to see here apart from these forced deaths - there's no original plot involved, it's just another CGI purple Homer Simpson lookalike who wants to kill everyone ""for balance"" with added amounts of forced drama and tedious dialogues. He also has some CGI minions that look like early-2000's video game villains, but I don't think those were even named. Also the film's largest battle is that between some CGI 4-armed monkeys and an African tribe armed with spears. Yeah.Also, still remember Thor Ragnarok? You know, the one which was mostly pointless as usual, but it did have Thor lose his hammer and eye? Well now it's completely pointless as he has both back. Just like IW will become pointless next year when the follow-up comes around.I quite liked the first two Avengers movies, and while the third one (Civil War) was already slightly overstuffed, it was still serviceable. This, however, just continues the downward trend of movies like Guardians 2 and Thor 3."
"I adored this movie. In my opinion, it is one of the best Marvel movies ever made. The Russo Brothers did an outstanding job at directing the movie, and made sure that there was just enough humour, battle scenes, and plot moments to not make the movie boring, but also not make it confusing, either.In the first few opening scenes, the villain, Thanos, and his henchmen are immediately portrayed as being very ruthless, dark and evil, when they massacre many innocent people; we are immediately given a apocalyptic scenario in the movie's introduction, but I think it shows what the heroes are up against, and definitely makes 'the Mad Titan' live up to his name.Throughout the film, different heroes from the franchise meet up for the first time to team up against the villains, and makes for some hilarious cross-over moments that you wouldn't find in any other Marvel movie. Despite all the humour and pop-culture references, there are some very dark scenes such as the torturing of Thanos' own daughter, and the slaughter of entire planet's populations ordered by the most interesting member of 'The Black Order', Ebony Maw (who is one of the best secondary villains in all of the Marvel movies, and really comes across as a terrifying character).Towards the end of the movie, Thanos is forced to make some terrible decisions to fulfil his quest to collect the Infinity Stones. Probably the most exciting scene is the blood-thirsty battle that takes place in the futuristic, African country of Wakanda. This is the ultimate fight between Thanos and the superheroes. This scene provides some amazing cinematic shots and definitely makes the whole movie worth watching. The movie's plot twist comes into place just when you think that the heroes have won. Some people may find the ending confusing, but I believe that it was the perfect choice, and sets up for its even more exciting sequel (which releases Spring 2019). It is interesting to see that the 'good guys' don't always win, and that Marvel is taking risky steps to improve the quality of their films.In conclusion, I would highly recommend that you watch this dark, but amazing movie as soon as you can. It is definitely one of my favourites, and I cannot wait to watch it again once the Blu-Ray releases."
"Infinity War is a good super hero movie. But I thought Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther were better.Marvel has a problem with level and types of power of the super heroes in their movies.
1) if a battle between the Hulk and Thor in Ragnarok nearly destroy an arena made for super powered combat I'm pretty sure Hulk vs Thanos in a spaceship would last one punch.2) Star-lord is just a dude, he does not catch and hold Spider-man.3) If Tony Stark can have dozens of flying robot iron men helping to fight bad guys in Iron Man 3 why not have 100s of them to help in Waconda? I'm sure War Machine would have access to activate them.4) If Scarlet Witch can pickup and drop 1000 ton alien attack blades near Wakonda why do 2 dudes in Scotland give her a hard time?5) Steve Rogers isn't invulnerable. When swarmed by alien soldiers with sharp claws and teeth he's apparently unharmed after Thor's hammer clears the baddies away. They had time to rip Steve up but didn't?Don't take the easy way out when writing the story. A lot of it was good but some of it was not. Writing poorly can break suspension of disbelief.
1) When an elaborate plan pins Thanos in order to remove his gauntlet so he can't DESTROY THE UNIVERSE nobody would stop to talk to Thanos about anything until that gauntlet is removed and someplace safe. At the very least you shut up and HELP REMOVE THE GAUNTLET so Thanos can't destroy the UNIVERSE!2) Gamora really thinks Thanos doesn't love her? All that time she was talking about Thanos not loving anyone made no sense. I kept thinking, Gamora, you're being really stupid, everybody knows what's going to happen... maybe you should try running or anything?3) When Thor arrives at Wakonda he apparently can crush 100s of those alien baddies with one jump/smash. Banner even feels he has time to stop, open his helmet to say ""You guys are so screwed now!"". But when all the heroes go to protect Vision from Thanos.... Thor arrives AFTER Thanos gets the last stone?I know I'm picking. It's because to much of these things can degrade a movie a lot and I'd rather not have anymore X-men The Last Stand or Fantastic Four (2015)."
"I'm not a huge fan of the superhero genre, but I'm able to appreciate these movies and have a good time when I watch them, however I can't say the same for Infinity War. Overall it was just a huge mess. A basic cliché formula which consisted entirely of several over-the-top action sequences with snarky one-liners from the ""characters"" every now and then. The plot barely made any sense, in fact most of the time I barely knew what was going on and the villain's motives were unoriginal and cliché There was apparently supposed to be a lot of emotional weight to this film but it just wasn't there for me. The balance between all the humor and high stakes was just completely off so I didn't know which scenes to take seriously or not.I think the weirdest part of this movie for me was that the Avengers felt oddly out of place for most of it. The Guardians Of The Galaxy are featured far more prominently so the rest of the characters just feel like random background soldiers who show up every few minutes to kick some ass."
"This film is disappointing, at best. Its plot is a series of battle set-pieces, in which a cast overstuffed with hero figures engage in pointless fights with an unbeatable enemy. The dialogue is throwaway, the scenes of human interaction brief and trivial, and the moral seems to be ""you can't win"". The ending is particularly offensive, because it violates the prime rule of narrative-- providing the viewer with a sense of closure. At the end (almost) everybody dies and then. . .The End. Tiresome, overwrought, and banal"
Studios making bad content in order to appeal to the masses and shareholders is like fracking - you get the best return right now but you wreck the earth. It's ruining the viewing habits of the American population and then ultimately the rest of the world. ~Jodie Foster
"When you hold ALL the Infinity Stones and can do anything with the grip of your hand, instead of killing off half of the population of the Universe, why not just provide a way for all to live and prosper?Make some more planets inhabitable for more space; make other's solely for growing crops to feed the population! When you have the power to do anything; and your goal is for people to prosper...think it through! Maybe the next film will have him sit in his chair and come to this conclusion! Bring everybody back; make life good for all! Certainly that's at least as easy as killing off half the population. And making a sucky movie in the process..."
"The ending ruined literally everything about the movie, they shouldn't split it from the next movie that fixes everything, the ending shouls have been the start of the next movie, it should have ended when thanos traveled back to seeing his daughter still young."
"Good action scenes, but that's about all this has to offer.
Oh, and the dialogue between Stark and Strange was at least interesting.
I thought Thanos would be a real badass, but then he has a crying scene! Give me a break! Also, Banner could not transform into Hulk! 
Acting was just okay, Downey and Cumberbatch were best, by far.
Story was predictable and pretty boring, ending was confusing.
Another movie that fails to live up to the hype."
"Avengers: Infinity War is the seventh film in Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the nineteenth film overall. Directed by The Russo Brothers (Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War), it is truly a terrific film of its kind and a near-perfect culmination of everything the cinematic universe has been building up to for ten years.Two years after the events of Captain America: Civil War, the Avengers team remain a fractured group of heroes, with some completely dropping off the radar altogether. However, one day, the powerful intergalactic tyrant Thanos (Josh Brolin) arrives on Earth to complete his collection of Infinity Stones, which upon acquiring all six, will allow him to control half of the known universe. With time quickly running out, The Avengers must reunite and team up with the Guardians of the Galaxy to put an end to Thanos' unquenchable thirst for power.Avengers: Infinity War is more than a typical MCU superhero film. It is a celebration of ten wonderful years of entertainment and overall fun. While the film does struggle with some tonal shifts during the first act, its brilliant action scenes and clever dialogue more than make up for these shortcomings. The film's ending will be overwhelming to some and most likely will divide fans over how it is executed. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo do a superb job developing Thanos' personality outside of simply wanting universal domination. His motivations feel somewhat morally ambiguous and at times even make him seem sympathetic. Despite the film's darker tone, there are still some hilarious scenes of banter among the heroes, particularly between Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Steven Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch). As is the tradition, be sure to stay after the credits for one bonus scene.I rate it a solid 9/10"
"Two and a half hours of film that'll be reversed in the first 10 minutes of Captain Marvel. Fun fight scenes, garbage plot, and yes I know it's allegedly building up to something, doesn't matter, still big let down...at least Deadpool 2 is only a month away"
"The 10/10's just go to show how shallow general audiences have become!! Far from a masterpiece... lots of camera shaking, too many characters, sensational garbage. Jam packing every single marvel hero into 1 film and an ending that is far from 'deep' and just forces you to watch the next installment to make sense of it.3 stars and that's generous!"
"This movie has various problems and the first major one is the lack of focus. We keep jumping around to various places and I can't even keep where all of them were.One moment, we are on earth, the next on Knowhere, the next on some other planet to which I can't even remember the name. And it's not just the places, it's the characters too. There isn't one lead or even 5 lead characters we can somewhat focus on. They try to focus on everybody which means nobody is the actual lead character. There was another movie that was initially praised but in the end was heavily critizised for lacking focus on a real main character - that was Star Wars The Phantom Menace. I see the same problem in this regard here with the story.Due to the lack of focus the movie also has pacing issues and therefore to me felt boring. And then this goes on for 150 minutes. And the biggest problem at the end of the movie is that there is no payoff.......ok stop, I have to correct myself there. The payoff (here comes the spoiler) is, that the bad guy wins. Everything the heroes tried to do failed and you know what I was actually kinda rooting for Thanos, because I couldn't care enough about any of the other characters. He became the protagonist for me, which makes me feel terrible as well, because he kills half the population in the universe.In the end I was just happy that the movie was over. However the writers put themselfes in a corner. Thanos is pretty much god at this point and objectively speaking there is no way anyone could defeat him at this point except if they go for something like ""his glove lost the power after he used it"" which is cheap. That will then result in the heroes trying to get back the time stone and then turning back time or something similar stupid.I will not see the next one in cinema. At this point I am pretty much done with superhero movies. I guess I can thank Disney now for first pushing me away from Star Wars and now Marvel.The effects and sound were decent though."
"We occasionally use IMDB to judge whether a film is worth watching at our local Odeon. Generally, that works well but a score of 8.9 for this film (currently) is hugely misleading IMHO. This is clearly a film that polarizes audiences - those who have bought into the Marvel franchise and have watched every previous film (31 apparently) mostly love it; those (like us) who have watched a few here and there seem to be disappointed / puzzled / bored.For a non-fan there are a couple of major issues: Too many characters and too much back story that we can't remember or never knew. The fights seemed rather perfunctory and, I know it's the fashion these days, but the shortness of each shot (a second? half a second between cuts?) makes them impossible to follow. One positive reviewer has criticised low scorers saying it's like watching the last 2 minutes of an hour-long drama and expecting to understand it. I think that's unfair. Surely a film should make sense in and of itself - I wasn't charged less to watch this one, so surely I should be able to enjoy it on some level? For the record, we recently went to see Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther and enjoyed them both (particularly the last one).Which I guess brings us back to where we started... redressing the balance of that crazy 8.9 score. No, this film is NOT better than Apocalypse Now (8.5) or The Terminator (8.0) or Citizen Kane (8.4) or Taxi Driver (8.3) or Raging Bull (8.2)... that's just crazy! My honest advice: If you like Marvel, you'll probably love this; if you're not a big fan, save your money for something else."
"Warning: spoilers.There is not much one anticipates from a superhero movie. Spectacle (with lots of CGI), iconic characters, some basic story arc, and saving the world in the end.
Infinity War didn't deliver. And I hate to utter that. I hate to command movies to stay within they genre... But if they don't, there must be reason. There must be good reason. The makers stripped this movie of the most important superhero-flick-features and what remains, just falls apart.First of all, there are way too many characters (could this have been the reason behind the ""end result""?). And then the story arc: it's a downward spiral. The heroes try to stop the villain(s) at multiple locations only to fail one time after another, letting the villain march through with his plan and collect each and every one of the stones. And finally the world is not saved. The end. Cast. Oh, wow. Thank you.Now for the spectacle: that was ok - though most of the fight scenes were too shaky and chaotic for me. I would have preferred less and more detailed scenes, but I don't complain. It a little bit felt like a Japanese anime though, where one combatant pulls a big ass weapon only to have their opponent pull an even bigger ass weapon, and on and on, until one time an entire moon (!) was dropped onto our heroes...For the positives: we did have some good laughs, and the main villain is well detailed (for a superhero movie). Also, Peter Dinklage!Lastly I hate to be blackmailed to watch next episode like this. So no, I will not watch the next one, at least not in the movie theater."
"Film was entertaining, ive watched all marvel movies multiple times.
This film is great fun but is far to rushed, of cause with so many characters involved was always going to be a tough one to do, part 2 may improve it.Happy i saw in Imax but would def wait till on tv to watch again.
overall an entertaining but average film with lots missed, nothing special and worse than some of the stand alone movies."
"Not a fan of superheroes but I attended the movie with my wife, who is a fan (promise of popcorn). 
I had no idea what was going on and the tedious CGI and probable impossible situations and loud music and interminable explosions made this a tortuous event to sit through. I recommend that if you go, you must be a fan of the genre otherwise it will produce a terrible tension headache. The popcorn was good, however."
"Marvels studios Avengers: Infinity War certainly lives up to the hype it generates.
Now take a slow peek beneath the 'hype' and what do you find?
You will see a repeat of what previous MCU chain movies offered:
Slick action and stunning visuals.
The producers know this mix works very well at the box office and so it comes to no surprise they apply this same formula again here. Supposedly the culmination of previous MCU movies, Avengers: Infinity War is where superheroes gather to prevent the main villain Thanos from acquiring a set of supernatural stones in order to become the most powerful being in the entire universe and beyond.With a disjointed plot, mediocre story line and poor character development for the main villain, Avengers: Infinity War falls below expectation as a standalone movie.
The story line totally fails in building up the viewer's eagerness for their superheroes to give Thanos a good thrashing.
(The exception maybe fanboy's for Bruce Banner)
The supers are made to look as if they are a bumbling bunch, caring more for their kin than saving the entire universe.
 On the opposing side, Thanos is a grey brooding being waiting a chance to tell his (or it's) dull life story....yawn.
Thano's screen presence doesn't invoke anything out of the viewer's emotions. No fear, anger or even sympathy; Nothing! Towards the end of the movie I thought it would have been just super if Dr. Strange opened up a portal from the 'other' alternate superhero universe for the man of steel to come and beat Thanos out of his boring stone hunting life.As of previous MCU movies, nutty one liners are a prerequisite and here in one glaring instance the scriptwriters stooped low for this. Is Avengers: Infinity war a great movie?
Opinions differ on opposite ends and with respect to that, let me say that Avengers: Infinity war is not great and not even good a movie.Parents (If family values are high on your list) with young kids wanting to see this, be aware that Avengers: Infinity War has a dark underlying theme.2 stars, one for Tom Holland and the other for Tom Vaughan-Lawlor."
I don't know how or who rated it above 8. Really disappointed
"Whole movies feels rushed . Most of the time fight starts --> fight ends and Thanos gets the stone lets move to next stone .
rushed story elements.
sub par action sequences .
most of the important actions sequences are not even present in the movie.
( fight sequence to get power stone , fight sequence when they capture thor, fight sequence on nowhere ........) it felt like fast forwarding through whole movie. well they ruined the joy of infinity war. too disappointed 
lets hope infinity war get a remake its deserve in future.( and by the time they do lets hope i forget this disappointment)
story in the movie could have easily divided into 2 parts"
"Keep in mind that just because s movie makes billions, that does not make it a good movie. Like most of Marvel movies this is an insipid mess. The entire plot took 10 years to develop and is summed up in this latest entry in 4 or 5 sentences. Acting isn't necessary or required, just grimace and look sweaty and vacant. Meanwhile we'll fill the screen with 50,000 CGI lights and explosions and convince you what is happening matters. Well it doesn't."
High section of people say infinity war is best movie of mcu even they know it is not perfect except thanos character development and nothing more and it dont appeal to every one with the over crowd and lack of character developments and they try to sell the emotion in the movie by the climax but majority people know there was upcoming spideman2 coming 2019 and gaurdians of the galaxy coming 2020 . i agree it is a complete entertainment movie but it doesn't carry the movie to be great movie this is only for the people who say infinity war is best mcu movie. for me i only liked thanos and thor stuff rest is come and go but i loved the movie whole but not in top 3 mcu films if marvel dint announce the upcoming films that's complete different opinion from me. #NoStakesEntertainment
"When you take 16 movies to build to one - remember to tell the actual history. You can't get to the apex of 16 movies, forget what you said, disconnect the dots, throw all the characters in and call it an epic. You really need a connected story. A team isn't a team when there's no tactics, no strategy, and no unified goal. With the amount of money spent making these films give a little money to the story tellers."
"We all know that these movies are blockbusters , we know that we should not expect much , when someone sits through one of these he /she should not expect citizen Kane , or the seventh seal , these movies are almost always mindless action scenes and big bangs and boom ( throw in a few punch line and some lame one liners and voila you have have your self an action movie ) but , at the same time these movies must be compared with other movies of the same genre , even the same universe to see pros and cons and for this i like to review it based on two of my favorite MCU movies. Winter soldier and Ragnarok , one being very serious the other choosing a very light and sarcastic approach ( almost parody like ) for their subjects , both i think did a far better job than this . As infinity war stumbles between being dark and fun and ends up tedious and stupid , characters do stuff which makes zero sense Heimadall can see all but he could not see Thanoses big ass ship ? Loki is holding the stone and he sends Hulk to earth ? Thanos acquires all the stones , becomes the most powerful being in the universe but has to kill people to save the universe ? cant he.. i don't know make the resources infinite and be everyone's hero ? If no , then why did it take him this long to act upon his plans ? Heroes run head on towards the bad guys LOTR style ? Its the 21 century guys humans don't fight that way you know , Thor has the power of lightening and thunder but needs an axe ? then why didn't he just chop off Thanoses head ? And the most important question , who invented these stones and don't they have something to say about how these things are used ? You see this is what makes a movie this big this bad . And since we are sure that the people who died are bound to be revived again ( don't bring visions back that guy is a nightmare ) there is no sense of tragedy or loss just a very lame move to pull on our heart strings ."
"(mild spoilers ahead)The movie is designed to appeal the viewers by the familiarity the audience has with the cast from all the previous installments. There are some humorous dialogues that are funny, which makes the movie deserve my second star. The effects are of course top notch, and one has to commend the technical aspect. 
 
Other than that, there is no logic whatsoever in the movie. Every exaggeration from the past has now been multiplied by a thousand. The plot could be summarized in a couple lines, with room to spare. I wish I had a time stone so that I can return to the past a few hours ago and tell me not to spend money on this disaster."
"First off i'll start by saying that i'm a marvel/superhero fanatic, i have an imdb account older than 10 years and this is my FIRST AND ONLY REVIEW. I'm still a little kid inside which loves superheroes. If you are the same, then you should understand the following. This movie is NOTHING except some fancy effects and some funny lines here and there. The only thing that made me give this movie 3 stars are the actors which gave me goosebumps when i saw them, the hope they bring (yes, i'm naive that way). Besides these facts, Infinity War is the biggest marvel movie dissapointment in their history which lead to an ending that couldn't be more evil (100% victory for Thanos), half the universe dies, heroes included. If you are one of those people who like happy endings, like me, this movie will dissapoint you to your core. It is sad that we have to witness the biggest weekend boxoffice for such a horrible movie. DO NOT be fooled by the big ratings on IMBD, we all know nowadays movie reviews in here are rigged more than the national lotery."
"This was crap to be honest. 
It had some good action but made no logical sense! A good movie must make good sense. First, Hulk is so toned down that Thanos didn't even employ any of the stones to beat him! In less than a minute he knocks Hulk out! ""We have a Hulk"" is so meaningless right now. Then Banner is forced into and kept in an iron man suit. Agrhhhh! Thanos is so hyped that he shouldn't be beaten even in part 5. How is it that Dr Strange never used the time stone? Then Iron Man and Spiderman (humans) are able to breathe freely on Titan?Also annoying, Vision is carried about like a baby, limp and powerless. You just wonder whether it's the same vision that was so powerful in Civil War and could walk through walls. Quite frankly, I wasn't expecting the Avengers to win Thanos in this part since it's a 2-part movie but let's put it this way; the avengers were humiliated! Probably should have been called - Avengers: Thanos the powerful.Waste of 2+ hrs for me."
"Once Thanos has the time stone, simply shoot back a thousand or so years so he can sit on his mountain side and relax. After a thousand years, do it again. If he's so concerned about his ""daughter"", why wouldn't he be concerned about wiping out half of the universe population? Doesn't make sense. Why wipe out millions of lives if you can go back in time and prevent them from even existing? 
Wonderful visuals and audio, but the scriptwriting is lazy at best. 
I wonder how much the actor who played Loki got paid for 10 min of screen time?"
"Man, i miss those days when superhero movies were actually good. tou know like the dark knight trilogy or spider man 2 and even LOGAN made me restore a little faith in this genre .this movie was the most overstuffed and over the top and unnecessary movie i'v ever seen. the dialogue as always seems like its written for 10 year old kids, but what else can you expect from Disney. and of course this movie will make a lot of money and so do the fast and furious movies. people seem to want garbage these days. oh and btw SPOILER! a lot of them die a the en, but guess what. they are guaranteed to come back in Avengers . smh. and i don't fault marvel for their universe filled with MEDIOCRE movies. we blame Disney. kind of how like they ruined last Jedi. we should bring back Sam Raimi or Christopher Nolan to save the superhero genre"
