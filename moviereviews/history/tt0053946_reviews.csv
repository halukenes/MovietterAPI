"We have been blessed with many, many wonderful films over the decades, and we have also been blessed with seeing many, many fine actors and actresses. Here you have a film, with a host of stars; brilliantly portraying characters from a true story, with acting that is sublime. The dialogue is sharp, witty, and each performance is gripping. Small town America, religious bigotry are all handled in a sympathetic manner by the use of powerful acting. I gave this film a 10 purely because it is one of those rare gems that stay in the mind forever. It is truly memorable, and one can watch it time and time again to marvel at the superb portrayals. There is a saying that they don't make 'em like they use to. No sir, they certainly don't!"
"Like Elmer Gantry I first saw Inherit the Wind in the theater in Brooklyn when I was 13 years old. Both of those films dealt with issues arising from the Roaring Twenties out of religion. At the time I thought both were great dramatic pieces dealing with issues of the past. I thought how much we'd grown up as a country from 1925 to 1960.If you had told me that 46 years later we'd be fighting these same battles and that preachers had as much political power as they do I and many others would have said you were nuts. Yet here we are today in an age when Pat Robertson is taken as a serious political figure. Inherit the Wind is a dramatization of the famous Scopes Monkey Trial of 1925 when a biology teacher was arrested and challenged a law passed by the Tennessee State legislature making it a crime to teach anything other than the account of creation as set down in the Book of Genesis. Dick York is the biology teacher here, renamed Bertram Cates for the play and the film version of that play.In fact all the names of the dramatis personae of the Scopes Trial have been changed to allow some creativity by the authors Jerome Lawrence and Robert Lee. Spencer Tracy and Fredric March play fictionalizations of Clarence Darrow and William Jennings Bryan named Henry Drummond and Matthew Harrison Brady respectively.Of course that is what Inherit the Wind is primarily known for, a duel of double Academy Award winners. In fact Spencer Tracy received another Academy Award nomination for this film, but lost to Burt Lancaster for Elmer Gantry. That's ironic to me because I thought March captured the essence of William Jennings Bryan better. Bryan is a man whose time has passed him by. But he's still a hero to the folks of small town rural America in the south and middle west. One thing to remember is that while Bryan was a great orator and advocate, he had not practiced law in over 30 years when he stepped into the courtroom for the trial. If he had been a better lawyer, he might not have fallen into the one big trap Tracy set for him and the trial and the attending publicity might have been better for his side.As good as Tracy is, the year before in Compulsion I think that Orson Welles captured the real Clarence Darrow in his character of Jonathan Wilk. No one in Hollywood could do long take speeches quite like Spencer Tracy though. I'm sure that's why Director Stanley Kramer hired him and they developed quite the screen partnership with Tracy doing four of his last five screen roles for Kramer. Stanley Kramer made some impeccable casting choices filling out the minor roles of the various townspeople of Hillsboro, Tennessee. There are two that I would single out. Claude Akins who usually played tough guys in various action films was astounding as the town preacher, the Reverend Jeremiah Brown. Sad to say there are still many like him out there. Akins's offbeat casting worked wonders, it turned out to be the high point of his screen career. On the opposite end of the spectrum was Noah Beery, Jr. who is a farmer and who's son was drowned some time before the events of the film. Beery is the town non-conformist, he refused to allow his son to be baptized and Akins has said the adolescent is in hell because of it.In a key scene when Tracy draws the ire of Judge Harry Morgan who sentences him to jail for contempt of court, Beery offers to put up his farm for collateral for Tracy's bail. Tracy's about to quit the case, but that simple gesture gives him hope, in the ultimate decency and clearheadedness of ordinary people. It's my favorite scene in Inherit the Wind.Stanley Kramer lived long enough to see this film become so relevant for today's times. I wonder what he must have thought."
"This movie is made by the performances. The material is very good, but at time its a bit melodramatic and obvious, which is the way the play is. Were it not for the collision of Spencer Tracy and Frederick March this would be just an excellent Hollywood film instead of the classic that it is.I would be tempted to say that all you need is a basic knowledge of the plot and the ability to jump straight to the court room scenes, but that would be unfair. Watch the movie once  and then after that you can simply watch the fireworks.What can I say about the battle between Tracy and March? Nothing. Words fail me. This is one of the great battles on screen in any film. It should be seen by anyone who wants to see how ""easy"" acting should appear. All the more important is the fact that this is a battle of ideas that still matter today as much as then. If only all of the world's problem could be debated this perfectly we'd live in a happier place.See this movie."
"It's a rare American film that takes the grand clash of ideas as almost its entire central subject matter, and Inherit The Wind has for that reason alone for long been a personal favourite. It's also a film that features some outstanding, larger than life acting, notably from the leads, whether it is Tracy, playing the crusty liberal for whom ""an idea is more important than a monument"" or the superb March, his performance full of facial tics and movement, and whose fundamentalist character does ""not think about what I do not think about."" Director Kramer clearly places his sympathies in the former camp, although he does not bludgeon the audience with preconceptions. In fact as a filmmaker he had a reputation for making movies that held opinions and took stands, with a particular weakness for courtroom scenarios. Inherit The Wind came after the post-apocalyptic On The Beach, and just before the sombre Judgement At Nuremberg (also with Tracy). In the mid-1970s the director also made three 'judgement' films for TV based on other real trials.Whilst On The Beach offers a verdict of its own on humanity's military foolishness, and Judgement At Nuremberg is a just as sombre account of another judicial milestone of different significance, arguably Inherit The Wind falls neatly between the two in ways other than just the order of production. Like On The Beach, it makes its judgement too: not on a worldwide disaster visited by man upon himself, but on the perils of stifling free thought. And, as in Judgement At Nuremberg, it's a trial of ideas here too. But whereas the evil ideology of the Nazis ultimately brought millions to their deaths and stands condemned with its architects, it is enough in Hillsboro that ""That if you take a law like evolution and you make it a crime to teach it... tomorrow you may make it a crime to read about it. And soon you may ban books... because fanaticism and ignorance is forever busy, and needs feeding."" In fact Tracy and March, with Kelly's able help, hold the centre stage for so much of the time that despite their best efforts the supporting cast seem a little enervated. The romantic subplot between Cates and his girlfriend (ostracised by her father for straying into the wrong camp) is occasionally a little cloying and, upon reflection is too much of a reflection from the main event. More damagingly, the character of the Rev. Jeremiah Brown, as portrayed by a miscast Claude Akins, is so fervent and cold hearted in the cause of the righteous that it occasionally wonders too close to self parody. An improvement to historical events is made by the introduction of a, for the most part, even-handed trial Judge Mel. It is he who provides an anchor for the audience in court as the two heavy weights slug it over points of order and procedural objections. Judge Mel also provides one of the trials more memorable, quiet moments when, just as it did in the real case, he finds the increasingly frustrated Drummond in contempt of court - only to see the fine which he levies paid for by the parents of a drowned child condemned by the fundamentalist lobby.In the light of today's religious debates in the US, Inherit The Wind seems braver than ever, and Tracy's character is allowed several hard hitting outbursts which, one wonders, would remain as so powerfully expressed if rewritten for a modern retelling. When he says, ""I don't swear for the hell of it. Language is a poor enough means of communication. We've got to use all the words we've got. Besides, there are damn few words anybody understands"" we all know what he means. And when he campaigns for a man to have the same right to think ""as a sponge"" it's a moment that remains starkly memorable. Curiously, a less emotional Darrow variant was essayed a year earlier by Orson Welles in Compulsion (1959), a version of another famous criminal trial. Inherit The Wind has been remade thrice more to good, but ultimately less memorable, effect (including once with Kirk Douglas) but the Kramer version remains ahead.Dramatic variances aside, inevitably any presentation of the Scopes trial, and such controversial material as it contains, will never please everyone. The source play upon which Kramer's film is based simplifies matters a little too readily and other criticisms can be made: for instance the original textbook from which the schoolteacher was convicted of teaching illegally evidently contained an advocacy of racist policies and eugenics unacceptable today while it also accepted the notorious Piltdown forgery as genuine proof of a 'missing link' and so on. Again, the relationship between Bryan and Darrow was more complicated in real life than the film has time or care to show - although ultimately one is so caught up in the fairground of judicial combat as the case progresses that one forgives such accommodations with the truth.Inherit The Wind stands badly in need of a decent special edition, a golden opportunity perhaps being offered by the widely followed 2005 debate that took place in Pennsylvania. The current disc offers little more than the film, although the widescreen presentation does justice to the splendid black-and-white cinematography of Ernest Laszlo, which effectively conveys the sweaty claustrophobia of small town, Bible-belt America. Whether or not the hesitation in bringing out such a potentially controversial, expanded package is a matter of intelligent design or just random selection, the public will have to judge for itself."
"This movie is well acted both March and Tracy perform remarkably.  The story line depicts how ignorance and blind faith can generate a mob mentality. It beautifully reflects the social values of the time and depicts very well the attitudes of the time in which the movie was set. Like 12 angry men, it has simple sets and gives hope to the notion that not only can movies be educational and entertaining, there are producers that care about making a meaningful statement using a plot and acting to entertain."
"The pleasure! Spencer Tracy and Frederic March going at each other. Masterfully spot on. As in most works of art, the passing of time adds to its relevance. Very much true in this case. Fanaticism without reason, such an everyday occurrence in our daily 2007 lives. There is nobody more deaf than the one who doesn't want to hear.Spencer Tracy personifies the truth, everything he utters is immediately believable. The cross examination of Frederic March is a classic on his own. The only discording notes are: the presence of Gene Kelly - very distracting indeed -and Claude Aikens in a way over the top performance. The way the trial is shot reminded me of the brilliant blocking of another Stanley Kramer film with Acting Giants And Relevant Themes ""Judgement At Neuremberg"" If you haven' seen ""Inherit The Wind"" do so, if you have, see it again and share the experience with your kids. I highly recommend it."
"I have recently seen this movie on t.v. and was highly impressed with direction, photography and of course the acting! Spencer Tracy is one of my all time greats along with Frederic March so imagine seeing them together! Some may thing March a little over the top but personally I find his performance one of the most riviting and engaging I have ever come across in film, he should have received an Oscar for this. Somehow although acting styles have become more naturalistic over the years the spark and energy given by the greats of the past is simply missing in the vast majority of modern performances. That God they are preserved on film."
"People like to comment on this film's ""overacting"". Try watching any of Joan Crawford's movies from this period and then get back to me. Inherit the Wind is a totally compelling story of the traditional school of thought versus a new scientific one. It centers on a small southern town coming to terms with Darwinism and its implications on Christianity. Spencer Tracy is an eloquent defense lawyer fighting to let evolution stay in the public schools. The script is quite good. The court room exchanges are thought provoking and moving especially when one knows about the real people and events behind the story. It's very difficult to come up with a criticism here. Not a weak performance to be seen."
"After recently watching each remake of this film, one can easily appreciate what an incredible film the 1960 version is.  It is the perfectly made film and should be held up to all as the pinnacle of film making.  It has the perfect director and the perfect actors.  It probably has the best behind-the-scenes crew ever assembled including the perfect film editor. The choice of black and white is also perfect.  This is one of those few gems where every element of film making came together to make the perfect movie.The story is very thought provoking from both points of view, the evolutionist and the fundamental Christian.  While I am not even close to being a Christian of any kind, I am haunted by the speech given by Matthew Harrison Brady that says how our children will turn into a godless mob with no direction without the teachings of the Bible (paraphrasing).  But, isn't that what has happened some 80+ years after the story takes place?  The actors effortlessly sell each character's point of view.There is very little that can be said about Spencer Tracy, Frederick March and Gene Kelly that hasn't already been said.  When you see the new version of this film, you can really understand why these actors are held in such high esteem.  These guys are actors!In short, this is one of the finest films ever made and should be seen by everyone."
"The last time I saw this movie, which was the first time I saw it, it played on TV when I was a kid, in the 1960s. I appreciated even then that it was a good movie, with fine acting, but it was a history lesson: a story about bigotry and ignorance in a part of the country that had been bigoted and ignorant back in the 1920s. Looking at it from a northern suburb in the 1960s, it was a source of laughter. How could those bible-thumpers have been so ignorant as to have denied science? In 2007, when polls show that 40+ percent of Americans - not just small town Southerners, but Americans in general - believe the story of the creation of the world as told in Genesis, when state after state finds itself debating whether ""creationism"" should be taught along side science in public schools, Kramer's film is if anything more powerful and prophetic than when he first made it. It demands the right of men to think freely, to be different, and that right has never been more under attack in this country.This is truly a film that, unfortunately, has gotten ""better"" with age."
"To see brilliant acting at by well-seasoned professionals at their very peak,  rent or buy this great American film classic.  Timing that is impeccable, nuance as subtle as could be, bravura declamations that are almost stunning in their power and intensity--this film has it all.  It should be studied and analyzed by any serious actor in the profession.  (It should also be studied and analyzed by any trial attorney as well!)  Who'da thought that Fredric March's raging bullpersonality could at times be so touching and tragic--or that Spencer Tracy's character should show such emotional and heartfelt depth when he is simplygrilling witnesses on the stand.  The trial is the very heart of the movie--and yet it is supported by a wealth of early 20th century Americana--the fire-and- brimstone preacher, the look and feel of that hot Tennessee Summer, theboistrous singing of ""Gimme that Ole Time Religion"" that makes the audiencewant to join right in, these are all terrific details that add to the keen enjoyment of this film.  But the trial's the thing.  And it is riveting!"
"Sometimes a film becomes dated over time, that it lacks relevancy due to the way its filmed and its content. But in the case of Inherit the Wind, Stanley Kramer's production in terms of acting and staging is dated, but the themes are sadly still painfully relevant. Evolution vs. Creationism is still a hot button topic, though of course it shouldn't be (and the Supreme Court has ruled against Creationism as unconstitutional), but maybe even more shocking is to see the town of Hillsboro and how it could be like some small towns in America, mostly the South and the Midwest. One wonders if the mob could be as large and howling and fervent today as it was in Hillsboro (or how it was during the actual Scopes-Monkey trial in the 1920's).But what stays most passionate about the film, and also at its most flawed, is its conviction about the issue. Kramer is a right director for this material, if not the best. It's full of passionate speeches- it could also be said 'preachy' not too ironically enough in some scenes- and blazing courtroom scenes that are not very realistic (the way the lawyers speak and speechify to the jury and the people in the courtroom and, of course, the audience in the theater), but somehow they're highly enjoyable. This doesn't mean the writing in the film is always great, or all of the characters. But the film is compulsively watchable 'issue' film-making, self-important but full of poignant touches.The wisest choice that Kramer made, akin to what he did with The Defiant Ones, is put BIG actors in these BIG roles. Chiefly these are for Henry Drummond, the defense attorney played by Spencer Tracy, and the prosecutor Matt Brady played by Federic March (or rather, devoured by March). Like Frost/Nixon, the film becomes really as much about these two men, two old characters who have known each other over the years and have a real respect/hate relationship with one another (see the scene where they're on the rocking chairs to see their connection). So throughout the film, while the issue of evolution vs creationism is brought simmering to a boil, Tracy, a sensational actor, has to try to keep up with March who is so over the top that he cracks the ceiling with a sledgehammer.Best of all is to see their showdown when Drummond puts Brady on the stand, a theatrical gesture but in keeping with the fact of the case (William Jennings Bryant really was called to stand during his own trial), and in having these two actors yell and stare and make big gestures at each other. If nothing else, it's worth it to watch the film for these two, though I might consider Tracy the winner overall, while March gets points in individual scenes, like when he grandstands towards the end when the case is dismissed (also when he stands up for the girl Rachel Brown when she is ""damned"" by her father, but as a calculating move to get her on the stand).Which brings me to some of the flaws in the film. Kramer has a lot that he wants to say as a filmmaker, but he doesn't know how to tweak anything down past it being super theatrical. It would've helped, for example, to cut just a little of the dialog, some of the pompous exchanges between characters (albeit some of the dialog is actually pretty funny, mostly when Gene Kelly's reporter disses Brady). Another problem was Rachel Brown, who firstly is concocted as a contrivance (hey, let's make the daughter of the evangelical reverend also the fiancé of the science teacher), but more-so that she's just a lame character, poorly written like many characters end up being in Kramer films, if not anywhere near as bad as the daughter in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. And the last little moment of the film, when Drummond puts together two specific books together, is a completely tasteless gesture, meant to appease both the believer and non-believer sect after what was a satisfactory ending between Tracy and Kelly where the former tells off the latter.But faults aside, the film does carry some legitimate power, and if nothing else I would watch it again just for the scenes between the two big stars. It's an actor's picture as much as a ""message"" picture, and as the themes carry some strong weight for discussion, not to mention the impressive semi-frightening sight of the Hillsboro religious mobs, it's really the actors who make it a (near) must-see."
"I happen to be watching this film (on television) for something like the 12th time in my lifetime, after having missed the opening titles as usual, and it finally dawned on me, this time, that the part of the benighted Bible-thumping counselor is played by Fredric March. That Fredric March, whom I have seen in every phase of his evolution from matinée idol in ""Sign of the Cross"" to middle-aged war veteran in ""The Best Years of Our Lives"". It never dawned on me before that that majestic and imposing but frightening patriarchal figure was actually achieved by purely actorly means - great talent, hard work, supreme concentration, attention to details and to the actors around him, magnificent make-up and outstanding mimicry. I somehow always assumed they had found a stage actor who fit the part to a ""t"", both physically and mentally, and who had never done film work before. Or maybe I thought they asked the real guy to reprise his courtroom performance for the cinema... That's how good March's performance is in this film. And he's just one of a hundred elements (including Gold's film score and Spencer Tracy's performance, of course) that make this a stupendous film."
"1. One of the greatest movies ever produced, ever, mesmerizing, perfectly acted directed and written. Perfectly cast. If you are a fledgling reviewer and want to see perfection so you can judge all future movies against something, start here.2.There is irony in the fact that the movie is about faith when in fact the hidden text here is the faith of Hollywood in itself. The year was 1960. According to many, the Golden Age of Hollywood had ended some 10 years earlier, and the 50s brought some of the strangest product ever to issue from the large studios and even the new indies. The late 50s catered mainly to teenagers and produced little that was memorable. Yet this masterpiece was done in 1960, just before Tinsel Town went into a bikini-world, Doris Day and Jerry Lewis and Elvis featured, spy and comedy fest that was so dreadful it would take another two decades before it could once again start entertaining people.3. This film is a testament to Old Hollywood's faith in its ability to once again produce a masterpiece of the kind that made film and film stars icons. Incredible."
"This film - about the 'Monkey trial' of a teacher who supported the theory of evolution over the teachings of the Bible - has two great reasons for watching it.  Spencer Tracy and Fredric March.  Together or apart, they are as wonderful as ever.  The film has great pace and energy and there is never a dull moment.  Simply a joy to watch."
"A couple years back, I watched a movie called *God's Not Dead*. And I hated it. All the Christians in the movie are flawless saints, all the non-Christians in the movie are worse than Hitler, the ""argument"" it gives for the existence of God at the end has more holes than Swiss cheese on a firing range, and it's overall completely biased and manipulative in its message. It remains the most insulting movie I've ever seen.Which is why, when making a film about a topic as sensitive as religion, you have to be careful. If you have a message to send which you see as important, it's so easy to make your side the good guys and the opposing side completely evil. But that's not the case in reality, and that's not the case in Stanley Kramer's 1960 movie *Inherit the Wind*.This story is loosely based on the Scopes Trial of 1925, where a Tennessee schoolteacher got in trouble for teaching evolution in the classroom, which was against state law at the time. It revolves around the trial, the questions it raises about religion and morality and law and government, and its human repercussions. And while it clearly seems to favor the side which believes scientific fact has a place in education, it shows both sides in a fair, sympathetic light. The trial in this movie, as in reality, takes place in a small town where the locals have a deep fundamentalist faith. But, it doesn't treat them as stupid. It shows how their faith gives the people meaning and purpose in life, how they'd naturally feel defensive if anyone challenged it, and how they're susceptible, like everyone, to human blunders. The movie's sympathies clearly lie with the modern viewpoint that public schools shouldn't base their curriculum on a Christian worldview (who would disagree?), but rather than demonizing the other side, it presents them as well-meaning but misguided.The movie also criticizes the other side - namely, any atheist who tries to shatter people's beliefs for no reason. One character, a journalist named E.K. Hornbeck played by Gene Kelly, is a slimy city-slicker and cynical atheist who constantly has a condescending remark about the uneducated townsfolk and the ""fairy tales"" they believe in. He rightfully gets a verbal slap in the face at the end. The defense is Henry Drummond, who's more quiet about his atheism and respects the beliefs of others, only lashing out when the separation of church and state is being undermined, so I identified with him the most. The teacher himself is actually a fairly minor character, but he's shown to be what I think most people would identify with - a Christian who doesn't take the Bible literally and has moments of doubt when times are tough, but takes to heart Jesus' message of love and tolerance. The prosecution is Matthew Harrison Brady, who's probably the most interesting character. A loud-mouthed politician and fundamentalist who's a nationwide celebrity for his preaching, kind of the equivalent of a modern-day televangelist. He's charismatic, eloquent, and larger than life. It's interesting how conservatives and reactionaries tend to rally behind confident men who are great at public speaking and telling people how to think, act, and live. It was William Jennings Bryan back then, and nowadays it's Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson. Still, unlike Ben Shapiro, Brady in this movie has moments of humanity. He has a strong, loving connection with his wife. He's shown to be former best friends with Drummond, making their arguments in the trial all the more gut-wrenching. He's firm and convincing in his arguments for his faith, coming across not as a strawman but as very much how a modern fundamentalist talks. But even he can acknowledge when religion goes too far. In the most chilling moment in the movie, a pastor damns his daughter to Hell for supporting the pro-evolution teacher (her husband), and Brady, visibly shaken, interrupts the sermon, gives a Bible verse which suggests being kind to your family (and gives the movie its title), and tells everyone to go home.One of the main complaints I hear about this movie is that it doesn't really follow the events of the Scopes Trial, and alters them quite a bit. But it never claims to be a portrayal of real events. As a History major, I can say that the real story of the Scopes Trial is a lot more boring than this one, and would've made for a worse movie. The differences were all conscious decisions, not mistakes. Hell, they even changed the names! It's pretty easy to figure out who's who if you know your history, but they clearly wanted just to get at the *spirit* of what the Scopes Trial meant for our culture, without worrying about getting every single tiny little detail right so condescending critics wouldn't point out the inevitable goofs. And yet they did anyway. It seems to me that the changes they made, or rather that the two playwrights made for the play this was based on, was meant to make it a more flowing, meaningful narrative. I support all the changes, and it's really cool to see the parallels and differences. It'd be incredibly easy to go on Wikipedia and fact-check every unimportant detail they got ""wrong"" in this movie. But I'd like to see those smug critics try and type up a better script than this one.Oof. Sorry, I just had to rant after reading some of the 1-star reviews for this movie. Anyway, in the same way *12 Angry Men* should be viewed by anyone who plans to practice law, I think *Inherit the Wind* should be viewed by anyone who's religious, or not religious, or...well, just everyone. It really examines all sides (except for religions other than Christianity, but eh, it was the early 60s) and gives them a fair hearing. It seems that American people have been split into not just into two different parties, but two different worldviews which have entirely different values, speech patterns, role models, and news sources: the more secular, liberal, cosmopolitan worldview, and the more religious, libertarian, patriotic worldview. This movie shows what our country desperately needs right now: real, honest dialogue between both sides. Few movies openly and fairly discuss religion nowadays - and I'm excluding those mass-produced evangelical flicks from the likes of Kirk Cameron, which are meant only to reaffirm the beliefs of people who already believe. Not meant to challenge you or make you think in the least, at *Inherit the Wind* does. My hope is to see another movie like this one in theaters sometime before I die. Our country sorely needs it."
"Dick York plays a young schoolteacher who deliberately breaks Tennessee state law in the 1920s by teaching evolution in the classroom, and afterwards he is arrested and put on trial in what is an intentional test case - the ""Scopes Monkey Trial"". Only here it would be the Cates Monkey Trial since the names have been completely changed. So Spencer Tracy plays Henry Drummond instead of Clarence Darrow, Fredric March plays Matthew Harrison Brady instead of blow-hard populist Williams Jennings Bryant, York plays Bertram Cates instead of John Scopes - an earnest young man who wonders if this is all worth it, and Gene Kelly plays E. K. Hornbeck instead of H. L. Mencken, eating hot dogs and airing satirical pieces and just getting under Tracy's character's skin in general in an early non-musical role.I suppose most observers would say this film leans pretty left, and I'm not going to argue with that, but there's some effort to give the Fredric March character some dignity, like when he intervenes in Claude Aikens' let-'em-all-burn-in-hell diatribe and when he cuts off his own inquisition-like haranguing of Aikens' daughter after his wife calls out his name. And the movie hedges its bets a bit at the end by having Spencer Tracy revealed as ""the atheist who believes in God"" and the way he balances the Bible and the Darwin book as if they carry the exact same weight.Also, all that singing about old time religion at both the beginning and end. And Dick York declaring that what we're witnessing locally ""is not necessarily the Christian religion everywhere"". The filmmakers certainly didn't want to cause riots or alienate Christians to the point that they wouldn't buy a ticket. If it doesn't offend your sensibilities too much, it's a nice acting tour-de-force with Tracy and March going at it. Florence Eldridge, the actual Mrs. Fredric March, plays her own husband's character's wife and shines in the role.I'd recommend this one as it has the overall spirit of the actual Scopes Monkey trial down pretty pat, in spite of all of the subterfuges and renaming of characters."
"O.K. -- maybe the Scopes trial was simplified, and maybe Kramer and the scriptwriters are a little too careful to tell you what to think at every minute. The Bible-thumpers are caricatures, Tracy practically wears a halo, and an overacting March keeps making monkey faces, as if to undercut his own anti-Darwin argument. The Kelly character, based on H.L. Mencken, is strictly a device; and even if Mencken did speak in constant epigrams in real life (which I doubt), the actor oversells the character's cleverness. With all that taken into consideration, it's still a handsome and gripping courtroom drama. The First Amendment arguments were brave in the late-McCarthy era in which the play was written, and they may once again be pertinent in these one-nation-under-God days. The central argument boils down to: People have the right to think, even if it leads to opinions that go against the common throng. That's a philosophy that will never go out of style."
"There are many actors who spend a lifetime making films and creating special roles which live in the hearts of millions. Other actors reject characters which limit their artistic efforts and struggle for years not to be typed casted by them. Some do, others do not break free of them. As one of millions of Spenser Tracy fans, the film ""Inherit the Wind"" will always be his defining character for me. The film itself is taken from the actual 1925 Scope's Monkey Trial which is the factual record wherein the Theory of Evolution was put on trial. Although few actual facts from the trial are used in the film, the stifling, courtroom drama itself, re-creates the volatile life, times and mood of the era. Bringing the sensational atmosphere to life are a treasury of excellent actors which offer some of the finest moments in cinematic history. Henry Drummond the defense attorney is superbly played by Spenser Tracy. His eloquent and formidable adversary is none other than Fredric March who plays, religiously infallible Matthew Harrison Brady. Gene Kelly is superior as E. K. Hornbeck, a cynical, but event savvy newspaper man. Dick York is Bertram T. Cates, the teacher on trial. Harry Morgan is interesting as Judge Mel. Claude Akins is surprising as Rev. Jeremiah Brown. The most interesting part of the film which is hailed by film historians, is the final courtroom confrontation. Tracy and March once friends are now battling in opposite ends of the legal issue. As a 'special' witness, March is hammered by the relentless Tracy who discovers that his life time friend does in fact have a fallibility after all. This film is a Classic in every sense of the word. *****"
"Writers had a very realistic and sympathetic view of human beings on opposing sides of religious/ moral/ intellectual viewpoints,(who are too often not sympathetic to each other). I found it to be profoundly thought provoking and well acted. It should be in theaters today given the resurgence of creationism nonsense in our public school systems. Plus it's just a heck of a good movie."
"Top cast assembled in a dramatized history lesson roughly based on the ""Scopes monkey trial.""  Tracy defends the embattled high school teacher and March tries to stir up the local opposition.  March is a bit too overstated as the Southern minister/politician (clearly based on William Jennings Bryant), but Spence is right on as the cynical worldwise lawyer who tries to defend people's rights to be different.  Kelly shines as a smarmy newsman, the type of role best suited to his character-style acting (as in his debut as a star in the broadway play ""Pal Joey"").  Morgan is the judge, who seems more wearied by all of this than anything.  Excellent atmospheric photography -- particularly memorable in the opening sequences."
"Science and Religion battle for supremacy in ""Inherit the Wind"", another one of director Stanley Kramer's middlebrow ""message movies"". Religion, the Holocaust, slavery, racism...Kramer liked big topics. But like Edward Zwick and Steven Spielberg, Kramer had a tendency to tackle them in the most dumb ways possible, his ""serious topics"" often treated in a frivolous or condescending manner.And so ""Inherit the Wind"" revolves around lawyer Henry Drummond (played by Spencer Tracy), who travels to small town Tennessee in order to defend a schoolteacher arrested for teaching Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. His opponent? Fundamentalist Christian Leader Matthew Harrison Brady, who has the entire town on his side.The film features an iconic performance by Spencer Tracy and Kramer's direction is at times wonderful, but one can't escape how ridiculously heavy-handed this film is. Kramer portrays American Southerners as being universally stupid and lemming-like, bashes creationists, paints agnostics/atheists in a saintly light and demonizes everyone who believes in the Bible. This is bigotry in reverse, the film deliberately stacking the decks by giving all the well-argued points to the pro-evolutionists and portraying creationists as goofy mad men. There's no debate here – just smart people on one side and fools on the other.The irony is, in the real world, the case upon which this film was based only started because the American Civil Liberties Union were itching for a fight with the World's Christian Fundamentals Association. They encouraged the teacher to teach evolution and convinced local mining associations and politicians that the trial's publicity would be good for tourism. Throw in the fact that high profile lawyers like Clarence Darrow were only attracted to this case for the free publicity, and you had a huge circus which highlighted, not the greatness of Science over Religion, but the ugly similarities which bridged seemingly opposing ideologies.Ultimately, however, the truth of evolution is not the theme of ""Inherit the Wind"", but the ""right to think,"" and the ""right to question."" What the film seeks ultimately to defend are the larger prerogatives of ""the broad, liberal, critical, cynical, sceptical, and tolerant mind."" In other words, this is a remake of Sidney Lumet's ""12 Angry Men"", a far better courtroom movie.7.9/10 – Kramer's heavy-handed preaching is made tolerable by a powerhouse performance by the legendary Spencer Tracy. Less applicable to modern audiences are the film's critiques of McCarthyism. Throughout the film, Brady's bullying and anti-intellectualism conjure up images of US Sensator Joseph McCarthy, and by extension an American tendency towards a kind of populism/fascism that hammers people into silence and crushes individual thinking; the very atmosphere of fear that McCarthy's tactics and power generated."
"This Movie was awesome. There have rarely been such titles where there is a major issue like religious ideas been questioned with the advancing of science. Spencer Tracy plays a magnificent part as an attorney to defend a school teacher who taught his students the theory of Charles Darwin. There Henry (Spencer) finds himself against a community who take the words of the bible as too sacred to question even by science while Spencer tries convincing them that the humans should be given liberty to think in order to advance. A witty script, well performed overall. Gene Kelly adds some good humor to keep it going. Overall a wonderful watch!"
"This film is truly the greatest picture of all time. The film brings together the greatest talent of the time and creates a masterpiece which shall stand for all time. Spencer Tracy, Fredric March, and Gene Kelly show how the craft of acting should always be done. Few actors today can re-create this same greatness. This film should be viewed as an inspiration to all, not just simply because of its great acting, but because of its message to the world of the dangers of who get lost in their religion. they ""... search to high up and to far away.""- Henry Drummond. And the idea of how something as expanding as science should never be limited simply by religious beliefs. Thank you and good night!"
"I have seen this film three or four times, recently on TCM. It was shot in black and white with actors now gone, but the topic itself is still very relevant. I know this because I recently visited an anti-evolution website and was witness to much of the same anti-science, anti-evolution jargon heard in Inherit The Wind.The acting in the film is first rate all the way through. Some of the performances are actually kind of scary (Claude Akins as Rev. Jeremiah Brown ) while others are more amusingly folksy (Harry Morgan as Judge Mel Coffey). The performances of Tracy and March although not exactly riveting, are top-notch. I will say that I found Gene Kelly to be somewhat miscast as smart aleck newspaper reporter E. K. Hornbeck. Maybe Tony Curtis would have been better. A trivial complaint for an excellent movie."
"Being (almost) right on the issues doesn't make this a good movie. Okay, okay I get the point that suppressing free thought in defense of orthodoxy is bad, just stop beating me over the head with it. Inherit the Wind is neither subtle nor complex - it is essentially a propaganda film (as others have noted), albeit one whose point of view most people would agree with.
With the exception of the enjoyably smarmy Gene Kelly as journalist EK Hornbeck, I found the over-acting by the lead players tiresome. The writing too seemed quite poor. As an exposition of the issues at stake, the court room arguments were completely garbled. Either attorney would be hard-pressed to win a high school debate, let alone a high profile court case. Defense attorney Henry Drummond's private reasons for supporting his client (and the moral of the story) are particularly wishy-washy. Rather than supporting the teaching of evolution on the grounds that it is the best-substantiated hypothesis while creationism is demonstrably false, he instead defends it on the basis that minority thoughts and viewpoints should be freely expressed. Unfortunately, the logical implication of this line of argument is that, in the current day and age, when evolutionary theory is universally accepted, any biology teacher who wanted to teach the minority view of creationism should be allowed to do so. The film's biggest sin, however, is its lack of courage towards the end. [Possible spoiler ahead] Rather than fully developing the idea of the moral culpability of the citizens of Hillsboro, this film ends up focusing all the blame on the intellectual arrogance of a single man, the prosecuting attorney, Matthew Brady. What a cop out! This movie just didn't have the guts to come out explicitly with the conclusion that the biggest villains were the southern voters who elected those supporting this silly legislation."
"None of the actual events around Mr. Scopes' trial happened like they showed in the play, which was so successful at lying that it became a movie. The city's were competing with each other to get the publicity this trial obviously meant, and the locals openly welcomed the ACLU people with open arms. William Jennings Bryan did not devolve into reciting the books of the Bible out of frustration. What the script does not show is that Darrow put Bryan on the witness stand first in an effort to discredit him and his theories, failed (every piece of ""evidence"" he produced has since been discredited), and then cowardly pled guilty to avoid having his client go thru the same thing. Why it's the worst? The kind folks here think it's ""story line depicts how ignorance and blind faith can generate a mob mentality."" Nuh uh. While the script shows those things, that isn't how the citizens behaved. At all."
"This movie is supposed to be a retelling of the 1925 Scopes Trial (aka The Scopes Monkey Trial) in Dayton, TN. The names of people and places have been altered slightly. Nevertheless, the movie (and play) hardly resemble what really took place in Dayton that summer. It was illegal to teach evolution in the classroom in Dayton at that time. John Scopes (Bert in the movie), who happened to be a substitute biology teacher - normally the PE teacher, was on trial for allegedly teaching that man evolved from the apes. The ACLU defended Scopes with well-known defense attorney Clarence Darrow. The prosecution was headed by William Jennings Bryan, a popular politician and self-proclaimed theologian. The townsfolk in the movie are portrayed as cruel and intolerant and in one scene want to lynch Scopes. In real life, Clarence Darrow remarked that the people of Dayton, TN were some of the nicest people on earth and had treated him and his client with great respect. This is just one of the many misrepresentations of what really happened. The actual transcript of the trial has recently been made available. I would encourage anyone who is interested in the truth of this event to read that. Unfortunately, this movie (and play) are nothing more than an attack on the Christian faith, especially concerning the Genesis account of creation. While Bryan had great intentions, he did a poor job of defending Christianity yet still won the case. This movie could have been very good if it accurately portrayed what happened and it still would have succeeded in making Christians look bad because Bryan performed poorly when he took the witness stand. Don't waste your time with this propaganda piece unless you have read the transcript or watched Dr. David Menton's video entitled ""Inherently Wind"" which compares and contrasts the movie with the facts of the case."
"A lot of people think this movie is attacking religion, but that's not what the movie is about. It's about not forcing your fanaticism on others. Let them have their opinion. Let us come together in discussion without persecuting one another. Let's get along and find your own intellectual and spiritual path. You really must sit down with an open mind and watch this movie from the very beginning to know what the movie is about. This film, as I'm sure you are aware, was based on a play, which was in turn based on a real trial in the 1920s known as the Scopes Trial or 'The State of Tennessee v. John Thomas Scopes'. In 1925, a high school teacher, John Scopes, was accused of violating Tennessee's Butler Act, which made it unlawful to teach human evolution in any state-funded school. He was put onto trial. In my opinion, I think he was frame. The trial was deliberately staged in order to attract publicity to the small town of Dayton, Tennessee, where it was held, and Scopes himself state out that he was unsure whether he had ever actually taught evolution. The trial served its purpose of drawing intense national publicity, as national reporters flocked to Dayton to cover the big-name lawyers who had agreed to represent each side. On one side was prosecution, William Jennings Bryan -time presidential candidate for the Democrats, and a devout Christian. Then on the defense was Clarence Darrow, a famed defense attorney that spoke for Scopes. The play Inherit the Wind (1955), by Jerome Lawrence and Robert Edwin Lee, is loosely based on this trial. It turns Darrow and Bryan into characters named Henry Drummond and Matthew Brady. Other character were change as well in the movie version, as well as numerous changes in the plot. Directed by Stanley Kramer, the movie and play was written as a criticism of McCarthyism in the US. One of the playwrights himself said (and I'm paraphrasing) that the play wasn't about science Vs religion, it was about a man's right to think for himself. This movie respects both religion and science but makes the point that God put us on this earth to think and question. Evolution is the only legitimate theory that has been put forward by thinking people that explains HOW? It is the purpose of all world religions to try and explain WHY? I think many critics fail to see the point of the movie which is the right to think differently. Secular political correctness is no different than banning the teaching of evolution. In my opinion, this film is one of the finest pieces of cinema ever to see the screen. I've never encountered a movie so dense, so full of ideas, so laden with brilliant dialogue. Such strong characters, so much tension in the air you can almost touch it. Spencer Tracy is legendary as Henry Drummond. I love the speeches he made in the trial. Tracey does manage to look effortless. He really embodies the character, making it appear that he's doing very little when he's actually doing quite a lot. Fredric March starts as Matthew Brady. Fredric March is brilliant in the role. Dick York was well cast as Bertram Cates (John Scopes in real life) in this movie. He was a young and sensitive actor and you see this in all of his pre-Bewitched roles. Surprising, Gene Kelly as supporting character, reporter E. K. Hornbeck (H.L Mencken in real life) is giving some of the best lines in the film. It's rare to see Gene Kelly in some a dramatic role. I surprise he wasn't nominated. He made it work. I do like the music in the film. 'Gimme that old time religion', song fit the film so well. This was an eye-opener. The music was perfect. The final scene shows Drummond walking out of the court room alone with the song ""Battle Hymn Of The Republic"" being sung in the background is amazing. The film was later remake starring Jason Robards and Kirk Douglas aired in 1988. It was again remade in 1999, co-starring Jack Lemmon as Drummond and George C. Scott as Brady. I have yet to see those films, but it's worth checking out. I just wish they had accurate version of the Scopes Trial. The movie is a Hollywood Interpretation of the trial with 99% of that movie is completely opposite of what really happened in the trial. I would love to see a great documentary of it. Maybe one day. The biggest different was Brady. The real Bryan was far more sophisticated in his outlook than contemporary anti-Darwinist fundies- and he'd find the modern religious right as objectionable as his contemporary social Darwinists. Overall: It's a classic creative movie that will evolute over time, reaching new generations of people to look into the film and ask themselves, the big question. Where did we come from? The more thinkers, the better."
"When INHERIT THE WIND first came out in 1960, I saw it in my native New York City as a college senior. Having majored in science as a pre-med student, I naively supposed this was an excellent movie about the 1920s. How could I imagine that it would be a harbinger of 2000?  Now, we have the Kansas state board of education excluding evolution from public school science classrooms.  So then Stanley Kramer's movie was a futuristic film in an early 20th Century setting.  Considering his film was made during the communist witch hunting McCarthy era, and now Evil-utionists (using Matthew Harrison Brady's pronunciation) are in season, INHERIT THE WIND is even politically relevant (I almost wrote ""correct"" but today that word has lost its meaning) today.  Now, I am a medical school professor who purchased two video cassettes of this movie right here.  I can't stop watching this movie because the excellence of the acting and filmmaking is timelessly exciting. I certainly encourage all of my students and children to see this film for two reasons.  The script provides a balanced insight into the personal issues associated with conflicts between scientific and religious (fundamentalist? extremist?) viewpoints;  and also these are, even now, contemporary issues playing out in the theopolitical system that American democracy has become.  And so Drummond's point to Brady is well taken:  "" ... does a man have the same right to think as a sponge?""  This is still a valid question raised  by a truly great, thought provoking and most entertaining American film. [Footnote criticism:  Gene Kelly an otherwise good actor (and certainly great Hollywood dancer), seemed a bit out of place as the cynical newspaper man.]"
"I am appalled at how many reviewers think that this is a factual or educational film. The movie is supposed to be about truth, but it is really a fictionalization with different names that completely reverses some of the events. The actual events of the 1925 Scopes trial would have been a better story.The textbook used by Scopes (Hunter's Civic Biology taught that Piltdown Man was a missing link, that the caucasian is the highest of the races, and advocated eugenics. In reality, Piltdown Man was a fraud and so was some of the eugenics evidence. Darrow refused to let either his experts or himself be cross-examined about what was really being taught by the text.Bryan was not a Biblical literalist. He opposed the teaching of evolution largely because of his longstanding opposition to eugenics."
"The performances and story telling are excellent but there are negatives. The depiction of Christianity is rather stereotypically negative (although some Christians are really almost like that). But the central premise of the film is highly questionable. It is in essence that a public school teacher has the right not merely to think what he thinks but to teach it to the students who are his captive audience at government expense. What if a teacher is a believer in ""creationism"", i.e., that the creation of the universe is literally as depicted in scripture and that the earth is less than 6,000 years old? Do you really think he has the right to teach his public school students that his belief is truth, or even that it has an equal truth claim to opposing views? Or is he required to teach the curriculum mandated by the elected school board, while free to think what he thinks outside the classroom?"
"Inherit the Wind is a great comedy. Unfortunately it was supposed to be a drama.I excitedly rented this film hoping for an intelligent and engrossing film on the famous monkey trial. Spencer Tracy is perhaps one of the finest actors of the 20th century and I figured I couldn't go wrong. What I got was a cartoon.It's obvious that those who love this film do so not for the quality of the film, but because it presents those of a liberal mindset their perfect fantasy -- that all those that disagree with ordained PC thought are a mix between Elmer Gantry and Foghorn Leghorn. As one previous reviewer stated ""Yes, it's a great shout for open-mindedness, so long as open-mindedness is in the end Darwinian.""This film was intellectually lazy and not even one of Tracy's better performances. Rent ""Bad Day at Black Rock"" if your looking for a better performance for Spencer at the tail end of his career. Or rent Inherit the Wind - but view it as the cartoon/comedy it is."
"When I was a kid, I loved ""Inherit the Wind"" so much that I had much of the dialogue memorized. Viewing it as an adult, I am horrified. This movie, oh so heavy-handedly, brainwashed me, and countless other viewers, into bigotry and lies. ""Inherit the Wind"" hates. It wants you to hate. In that, it is in the same category as, though less toxic than, propaganda films like ""The Eternal Jew."" To be clear: I'm a Northern liberal, I learned evolution in Catholic school, and I never had any reason to doubt Darwin's theory. I love old movies, and have eagerly followed Frederic March from ""Death Takes a Holiday"" to ""Best Years of Our Lives"" to this. In short, I might have continued to love this movie.There's a lot in ""Inherit the Wind"" to love -- or, rather, to seduce.Gene Kelly is E.K. Hornbeck, a character based on journalist H.L. Mencken. Hornbeck delivers one lapidary, laugh-out-loud jibe after another. Kelly's feet don't dance, but his tongue does, and impressively, Kelly was never smoother or sexier. His quick wit penetrates clods' phony piety; he's a hero with only his tongue as a weapon; you want to be like him.Spencer Tracy is monumental; he took a break from posing as the fifth face on Mount Rushmore (and getting drunk and cheating on his wife) to pontificate as Henry Drummond, a character based on Clarence Darrow. Tracy's Drummond is integrity's last, best hope against a world of small-town, Southern, Christian, ignorance and malice.Frederic March as Matthew Harrison Brady, based on William Jennings Bryan, depicts Tracy's opponent as a fat, befuddled, self-deluded old man.Overall, ""Inherit the Wind"" depicts the battle of light -- Northerners, atheists, and white collar types -- against the forces of darkness -- Southerners, Christians, and too many blue collars or rednecks.Thank God, or H.L. Mencken, I've grown up a lot since I first saw, and loved, this movie.There are two problems here: the movie is a pack of twisted lies. There is a very good site devoted to debunking this movie; it's called ""The Monkey Trial."" Point by point, and with quotes and full citations, the site goes through the film's many lies, and history's truths.HL Mencken was a bigot; his real comments about the South, not to mention African Americans and Jews, are atrocious.William Jennings Bryan was one of America's greatest orators, not the befuddled dunce Frederick March portrays in this film. WJB was a champion of the working man; see the 2006 WJB biography by Michael Kazin. This biography points out that WJB electrified the masses with his speeches, helped make FDR's New Deal possible, and fought against Social Darwinism, the truly evil application of Darwin's theories to elitist, classist, racist, anti-immigrant, eugenic purposes.The entire plot of the movie is nonsense; the Monkey Trial was a publicity stunt hosted by the town itself.So, given that ""Inherit the Wind"" is a pack of lies, what *is* its underlying logic? Its underlying logic is hate, pure and simple. Christians: BAD BAD BAD!!! Southerners: BAD BAD BAD!!! Working people, or, as Mencken labeled them, ""peasants"": EW! Atheists: GOOD. Our Best hope.When it comes to movies like this, we don't need to try to imagine what it was like to live under Stalinist regimes. We Americans were subject to brainwashing ourselves."
"I believe in Darwin ( I actually have his book in my modest library, and have read it). I My property has fossils that are 400 million years old. I recently viewed this film on TCM, I couldn't help but come to the conclusion that the film is a well crafted and entertaining bit of propaganda. This film is a thinly disguised reenact ion of the Scopes ""Monkey"" trial. For the record, the defendant, a teacher who believed in Darwinism was convicted for teaching a concept that was against the prevailing law at the time. In the real trial, Spencer Tracy played Clarence Darrow, and Frederick March played William Jennings Bryan. For the record, Mr. Bryan was a three time nominee of the Democratic Party for President. In his time, he was considered a great progressive who represented the common man, particularly the people who worked in the farms and factories. For some, his only fault was that he was a devout Christian who believed, as most people in his time believed, that the Bible was the highest authority.Clarence Darrow was one of the most famous lawyers in the country, who also took on cases that represented the common man. He was also the man who defended two very rich children who on a whim of arrogance killed a child. It was one of Darrow's last cases, and in my mind, blemished his otherwise noble career. He did it for money, not for any altruistic purpose that was a hallmark of his career. He was also a ""devout"" atheist.The problem I have with the overriding theme of this film is its portrayal of bigotry and ignorance. Bigotry and ignorance is not limited to people who lived in the ""bible belt"". For every instance of defects in those people in those times we have the example of intolerant people using Darwinism and ""survival of the fittest"" as building blocks of the totalitarian political parties that made the 20th Century the bloodiest yet.Darwin's theory of evolution was incorrectly popularized into the ""survival of the fitness."" which replaced religion as the foundation of the totalitarian political parties such as Communism, Nazism and Fascism. The people who held these new views of society misused Darwinism in the same fashion that many misused Christian beliefs. This film seems tainted by an obvious ""we know, you don't know"" bias that is no different than those who thought that the Nazi's had all the answers to the problems of mankind. This film seems to be an odd and unfair way of condemning bigotry by portraying those who believed in the old Christian beliefs as oafs, and those who believed in Darwin as enlightened and likable characters. This is not art, this is propaganda. I give the movie 9 out of 10 because it has taken me years to see the film as propaganda."
"I remember reading Inherit the Wind in my high school, we kinda watched most of the film, but since I haven't seen it in almost 5 years, I figured to watch this movie again and give an adult's point of view. Another thing that was interesting to me about this film is that my dad is a minister and I am still searching for what I truly believe in, so I could relate to this story fully now and really understand the pain that Bert must have been going through. It's a scary thing standing up to someone who will never accept anything other than their beliefs.Bert is a biology teacher in one of the most religious towns in the south and he has begun teaching evolution vs. creation, meaning he's not teaching from the bible, he's teaching the scientific ways. It's not that he doesn't believe, he's just giving a different view to the kids other than religion is the be all and end all of their world. Well, the town goes crazy and wants Bert to burn for his teachings, so two lawyers have been assigned to battle it out for the case of science vs. religion.The reason why this movie is so excellent isn't just the terrific acting, it's the story that a lot of people I'm sure could relate to one way or another. Religion is such a huge deal still to this day and I'm sure that there are many families who are either highly religious or don't believe, this is the story for them. Inherit the Wind is a timeless tale that forever will be an important addition to today's society.10/10"
"This film is based on a unique play - one of the few successful stage dramas based on actual dialog from a classic courtroom clash. The play, INHERIT THE WIND, was written by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee. Produced in the middle 1950s on Broadway, it starred Paul Muni as Henry Drummond, Ed Begley (Sr.) as Matthew Harrison Brady, and Tony Randall as E. J. Hornbeck. It has never stopped being one of the most revived of American plays, both on stage but also on the television screen (three times!) and once on film (the present subject of description). It is based on the trial, in Dayton, Tennessee, of the State of Tennessee v. John Scopes, which happened in 1925. Scopes had the temerity to break a current statute which made it illegal to teach Darwin's theory of Evolution in biology classes. The state legislature of Tennessee had passed the anti-evolution statute because the majority of the voters felt uncomfortable with Darwin's theory as opposed to the version of creation as found in Judeo-Christian scripture (in the book of Genessis).It was a bad period in America in much of the south and Midwest for unpopular foreign ideas and foreigners. It is no accident that the national argument against Darwin arose in the 1920s just as the Ku Klux Klan revitalized, grew to nearly 10 million members across the country, and captured several state legislatures (such as Indiana). Anti-Catholic, anti-Semitic, anti-Black, anti-Foreign, it was powerful in this period - a period that also saw Senator Hiram Johnson embracing bigotry and setting up those immigration quotas that helped doom so many Jews trying to flee Nazi Germany in the 1930s. So the anti-evolution law was a product of it's time.In the trial, Scopes was defended by Clarence Darrow. Darrow was normally a criminal trial attorney, but Scopes faced possible imprisonment under the law (the terms of punishment were vague). The prosecution was handled by three time Presidential candidate and former Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan. On the fringe as a reporter of the trial was the great cynic and words-smith H.L.Mencken, representing the Baltimore SUN.In the years since 1925 much legend has grown about this clash. In the present age, given the rise of the anti-Evolution movement to push ""Creationism"", what happened at the trial seems in vain. There is some truth to this, but there is some fiction. Creationism, in the modern age, is based on the same religious dislike Darwin's atheistic views, but it is embraced by many non-Christians as well as Christians in America. Also, it by-steps the problems of the original crusade by stressing that the schools teach Evolution as one of competing theories for the creation of life on earth. The trial was to show the problems of over-reliance by the right on the Bible, for Darrow (thwarted in bringing scientific information into the trial) cross-examined Bryan on the stand. Bryan (rather stupidly) agreed to this, and was shown to be remarkably close minded on scientific progress. But worse, he did show (to his followers) that he was willing to interpret the Bible and not accept everything literally. It was a shocker to his supporters in the country.The result was that Bryan won a Pyrrhic victory - Scopes was convicted. But publicity of how backward Tennessee looked made the state's leaders tell the judge to go easy on the punishment. Scopes was ordered to pay a small fine. It shattered the effect of the law. A week after the trial Bryan died in his sleep.Want of time prevents a full scale discussion of the case - there is evidence, for instance, that Scopes was asked by politicians to break the law as a test case. The textbook Scopes used had racist (anti-Black) ideas in it that were then perfectly acceptable in Darwinian circles in 1925. Bryan's slap at Darwinism was not totally without merit - a believer in Jeffersonian democracy all his career, he disliked the perverted form of the biological theory that was known as ""Social Darwinism"" pushed by eastern elitists to control the masses. In fact, Bryan planned to cross-examine Darrow on his explanation of this theory but was prevented by the Judge. Pity, it might have been interesting.Spencer Tracy and Frederick March are wonderful in their capturing Darrow and Bryan (here renamed Henry Drummond, after a 19th Century agnostic, and Matthew Harrison Brady, after the Civil War photographer). Their clash on screen is well worth seeing. So is Gene Kelly as Hornbeck/Mencken - a man in love with the language (""Ah, Heavenly Hillborough"" he intones about the play's location), and with his anti-democratic cynicism that turns off Tracy at the end. Dick York as Cates/Scopes is properly stoic until he prevents Tracy from putting his girlfriend through a cross-examination after March tears her apart on the stand. Florence Eldritch (as Mrs. Brady) gives a fine performance as his most loyal and loving supporter (and one whose fears for him come true). Harry Morgan as the Judge, Claude Atkins as a rabid fundamentalist minister, and Noah Beery Jr. as a farmer who helps Tracy out for personal reasons are all fine too. A first rate film."
"The 1925 Scopes ""Monkey"" Trial launched the debate between evolution and creationism. In ""Inherit the Wind"", the story is fictionalized. High school teacher Bertram T. Cates (Dick York, before ""Bewitched"") is arrested for teaching evolution. A trial ensues, at which civil rights lawyer Henry Drummond (Spencer Tracy) represents Cates, while Bible-thumper Matthew Harrison Brady (Fredric March) represents the state.What stuck in my mind as much as (if not more than) the trial was the revolting attitude of the townspeople: in one scene, they march through town carrying a burning effigy of Cates, singing about how they'll hang him. Once more, religion gone too far.I don't know exactly how accurate the movie is, but it still manages to show an important event in our nation's history. One that continues getting fought to this day.I wonder what those hell-fire-brimstone townspeople would have thought if they'd known that this man whom they believed was working for the Devil, would be played by a man whose most famous role would be on a TV show about a witch."
"I suspect the reason that this film is not on the top ten list is because it is pro evolution. Some folks believe otherwise and surely voted negatively. Being a staunch proponent of evolution myself this movie is my all time favorite. It touches on a upon a theme which has made man great:  men, faced with great opposition, who choose to think! There was a remake with almost the very same script and it clearly shows just how good the original actors were. The remake was very good but pales in comparison. The only improvement over the original was Kirk Douglas did a better job as Matthew Harrison Brady"
"It is hard to believe this movie was filmed quite a long time ago, let alone the events it was based on (1925 i believe). Spencer Tracey is Damn Good as always. This issue is still a heated one even today, but i think the answer is best symbolized at the end of the film with Tracey grasping the Bible and Darwin's book together under his arm. Evolution and the belief in God(I said God...not religion) can coexist and one without the other will leave you with an unhappy(Hornsbeck)or unfulfilled(Brady)life."
"Bosley Crowther of the New York Times on (10/12/1960)said it best "" Director Stanley Kramer has wonderfully accomplished not only a graphic fleshing of his theme, but he also has got one of the most brilliant and engrossing displays of acting ever witnessed on the screen.... When the two men come down to their final showdown and the barrier of dogma is breached, it is a triumphant moment for human dignity--and for Mr. Tracy and Mr. March."" YOU BET. If you want to see the zenith in the field of acting,be it on the stage or screen, then seeing Fredric March and Spencer Tracy ""go at it,"" is your bag. I sat GLUED before that TV screen for the entire 2:00. The most amazing thing about the film is its timeliness because in many instances, here in 2007,we are still annoyed by those who think they are God's lawyers or spokesmen, providing of course there is a God. I would assume so but I couldn't place my hand on a bible and swear to it.Oh what Charles Darwin did to us all with his ""Origin of Species."" One man came along and opened, much to the chagrin of bible thumpers, the idea of the evolution of man from lower species, then to simians and down from trees we came. Once upon a time in 1925 Tennessee, a teacher named Scopes had the audacity to question creation in front of his students and it ended up as ""The Monkey Trial""---a war between celebrity barristers Clarence Darrow and William Jennings Bryan played by Spencer Tracy and Fredrich March respectively. Mind you, the film is BASED on that trial and was never meant to be an accurate portrayal of it.In today's America, are not Presidents chosen due to religious sentiments of the voting constituency instead of solely on their ability? Of course it's true so have we Americans ever awakened 80+ years after that Scopes trial? Hardly. Has not the RELIGIOUS issue of abort or not to abort taken over the Republican Party? In 1925, Darrow asked what happened to the idea of separation of church and state. That question is still being asked now. Why can't we get the religious ""monkey"" off our backs and learn to keep God in houses of worship instead of in houses of Congress? Put on the TV and watch for yourselves all these bible thumpers who know it all and hello? We are back to Fredric March playing W.J.Bryan in ""Inherit the Wind."" The concept of God is so beautiful but organized religion can be so ugly,intellectually constricting and prejudicial to the concept of brotherhood, it detracts from the very concept of a Creator which is the exact opposite of its purpose. ""Inherit the Wind"" is certainly a masterful film and is for any THINKING person. It's for anyone who appreciates a film that makes one think instead of simply munching on popcorn. It's a ""horizon broadening"" motion picture, totally captivating, intriguing and powerful. Rent it or watch it on TCM. You'll never regret it."
"A souped-up Hollywood adaptation of the historical Scopes ""Monkey"" Trial in 1925: a high school science teacher is tried for teaching Darwin's theory of the evolution to his students on account of the violation of a Tennessee's state law. Under the able hands of Stanley Kramer, INHERIT THE WIND sets two Hollywood titans (Mr. Tracy and Mr. March, both two-times Oscar recipients) against each other in their friend-and-foe collision in this sweat box courtroom drama. Sometimes, one has to see it to believe (although paradoxically, cinema is an art-form of illusion in its nexus) that, barely one century ago, humanity has once descended onto a level so hidebound and fanatically idiotic, and it is not a beauteous sight at any rate (unnervingly relevant to today's milieu, one has a fair reason to be vigilant that a giant and similar regression might be right in the offing). To a liberal mind, why ""the right to think"" needs to be pointed up in a legal court is beyond belief, and one's mild contempt cannot be mitigated by Kramer's rip-snorting deployment aiming to heighten religious bigotry and hostility: whether it is that poignant chanting of OLD TIME RELIGION by an uncredited Leslie Uggams opens the film, or a grand pageantry to glad-hand Matthew Harrison Brady (March), a beloved statesman and the standard-bearer of biblical piety, to join the prosecution team; or the appended fictitious story between Rev. Brown (an imposingly conflicted Claude Akins) and his daughter Rachel (an equally conflicted and tormented Donna Anderson), who is the fiancée of the defendant; or the townsfolk's relentless marching demonstration of baying for blood, all of which ultimately render the ending a shade anticlimactic. Henry Drummond (Tracy), Mr. Brady's arch enemy in the regard of religious fervor, comes to the aid of the ill-fated defendant Bertram Cates (a callow but unshrinking, martyrdom-seeking Dick York), along with a cynical newspaperman E. K. Hornbeck (a boater clad Kelly, blithely shooting sideswipes with his scarcely tapped straight-facedness) to warrant a national coverage of this hot debate. Needless to say, the meat of the film is the verbal face-off, Mr. March (won a Silver Berlin Bear for his grandiose hyperbole but snubbed in the Oscar race), firstly comes off as a vainglorious dogmatist, repugnant prima facie, but significantly blunts our antipathy through the scenes with Ms. Brody (played by his real-life wife Florence Eldridge, graced with a hallmark of sensibility and empathy), Mr. Brody is nothing less than a buffoon blinkered by a misinterpreted belief to a point, after his feet of clay is disclosed, he is summarily deserted by his followers, and when his cant- ridden peroration sounds his death knell precipitated by his undue gluttony, there is pathos oozing. Mr. Tracy, chalked up his 7th Oscar nomination out of an aggregate of 9, is indisputably at his best whenever he gushes with meticulous long-takes (as in other two Tracy-Kramer collaborations: JUDGEMENT AT NUREMBERG 1961 and GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER 1967), potently elicits searing emotion with immaculate immediacy but also conspicuously serves justice to the script's dialectics, and what can one say? Just watch and wait to be awestruck. A quintessential pedagogic lesson about human and humanity, INHERIT THE WIND should be promulgated as an elementary school staple for every pupil to acquire how to accept and embrace inclusivity and individuality among others, maybe, that is the cure for massive cock-ups scouring our present universe."
"I agree with Joe Karlosi's general assessment of the film (I've watched it twice so far), which I consider to be Stanley Kramer's best; I don't have MGM/UA's bare-bones DVD but do own it on VHS, taped off Cable TV. The film pits two acting giants against one another for the only time in their illustrious careers: even if essentially understated, I think that Spencer Tracy delivers perhaps his greatest performance in this film (which deservedly earned him an Academy Award nomination) portraying famed lawyer Clarence Darrow  who was played by a burly Orson Welles a year earlier in COMPULSION (1959) - in all but name; Fredric March, who by this time had slipped into supporting roles, countered this with a showy (and necessarily hammy) portrayal of his flamboyant adversary, the true if misguided 'villain' of the piece  his flustered death scene is very moving and he managed to capture the character's every nuance perfectly, in my opinion; I would have liked to see the Academy recognize his contribution equally but at least he did win the coveted Best Actor Prize at the Berlin Film Festival! I have to wonder at this point whether the two actors ever threaded the subject of their respective DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE movies during shootingINHERIT THE WIND also features Gene Kelly's most satisfactory non-musical film performance as a cynical reporter, who is also an opportunist and something of a heel; it's interesting, too, that Kramer had just utilized Kelly's dancing 'rival' Fred Astaire in a straight role in his previous film, the excellent if depressing end-of-the-world opus ON THE BEACH (1959).By the way, Joe, I don't feel that Kramer intended to bash Christianity at all with this film: his main concern was freedom-of-speech which the teacher put under trial was prevented from exercising by the bigoted community, which in this case happened to be over-zealous practitioners of the Faith! Still, you shouldn't underestimate the implications of that final scene  the confrontation between Tracy and Kelly and its aftermath  where the agnostic lawyer's true (and, in retrospect, contradictory) beliefs come out into the open, and the harmonious co-existence of science and religion is entertained."
"I've heard all the praise heaped on this movie, and it was the first American movie to win two awards at the Berlin Film Festival.  For the life of me I don't understand why.  The performances are overblown; the script is a mixture of speeches, sermons and cliches; the props look like they were made by a high school drama club; the sets look like Disneyland.  The singing and music drive me insane about thirty minutes into the film.  If you want to see a great courtroom movie from the sixties set in the old Deep South, you should rent ""To Kill a Mockingbird""."
"If this was a fictional courtroom drama, it would be a great movie. However, it is meant to be a true retelling of actual historical events. It is nothing of the sort. Most of this movie is totally false and skewed to make the Christians look like witch burning idiots. Unfortunately, most of you will take this movie to be 100% fact and run with that. I challenge anyone who has watched this movie to search the web for the true history of the Scopes trial. This movie is nothing but pure fantasy/propaganda for atheists and Christophobes. If you are truly open minded and care about real history, look into it. You will be shocked at how false and misleading this movie is."
"I have read a number of your readers' comments about the film and could add very little of usefulness to the many plaudits expressed, which plaudits the film so richly deserves. However, I would like to comment upon a very interesting coincidence involving the role of one of the characters in this film, E.K. Hornbeck, a newspaper reporter covering the ""Monkey"" trial (played brilliantly by Gene Kelly, the character being, most agree, after H.L. Mencken, the prominent newspaperman, book reviewer and political commentator who covered the actual Scopes trial in 1925.) Kelly plays a cynical newspaperman who is the ""bete noire,"" the gadfly of both Henry Drummond (the Spencer Tracy character) and Matthew Harrison Brady (the Frederic March character.) For Hornbeck everything is false, everything is a ""con"" in one way or another, including Brady's old-style religion and Drummond's belief that modern science and philosophy belie a literal reading of the Bible.In another fine film - some say also one of the finest ever produced by Hollywood - Elmer Gantry - Arthur Kennedy also plays the role of a newspaperman, covering the religious ""revivals"" held by the lead characters, played to perfection by Jean Simmons and the incomparable Burt Lancaster. Simmons plays Sister Sharon Falconer, who really believes - at least at the right moments - that she's speaking to God and God to her, especially when her minions are passing the trays for contributions in the revival tents. Lancaster, as Gantry, is a down-and outer with a silver tongue who charms his way into Falconer's inner circle (and later into her boudoir) who believes only in separating the marks from enough of their money so that he and Sharon can get out while the getting's good and ride off together into the sunset. The coincidence is that Kennedy - the cynical reporter who sees and understands all that is going on, expresses his contempt and cynicism at every opportunity, thus playing the role of a ""foil"" strikingly like the role played by Kelly in Inherit the Wind. (The Greeks had a name for such a character - the leader of the Greek chorus, or ""Choragos,"" who commented upon the action in a play but took no part in it.) As Kelly did, Kennedy played the part to perfection.So anyone who enjoyed Kennedy's role in Gantry should definitely see and carefully study Kelly's role in Inherit the Wind, and vice versa. The are both extremely intelligent, provocative roles, incomparably acted, with similar messages to convey."
"Regardless of your personal view of Darwin, INHERIT THE WIND was an awful movie. There are two basic and serious flaws with it.As an agenda-film it deserves a big fat F. Any good courtroom drama has got to have tension and suspense, so when the deck is stacked by making the Darwin advocate (TRACY) as a powerful Mr. Stoneface who never misses, never stumbles; while Creation advocate (MARCH) is literally played as a blithering idiot --- where is the alleged drama? In point of fact, the character March is playing was William Jennings Bryan who three times was a candidate for president of the United States, based on his oratory skills. Not exactly a babbling idiot.The second thing is that INHERIT THE WIND is a lie from A to Z. The play has replaced real history in the minds of many, and that's not good. I challenge anyone to Google Scopes Monkey Trial --- spend 90 to 150 seconds --- and read the true facts. I promise you they are nothing like this BIG LIE snow job of a movie."
"This Movie and it's remake are among the worst movie travesties that exist and are pushed on us. sure the acting is good the stars were huge. my question is why was this trash ever made into a movie. regardless of your view upon the subject matter this film should offend you. when I see people use the term ""loosely based"" or simply ""based"" on the Scopes Monkey Trial, I'm shocked. even the most casual looking into the matter reveals the outright defamation of the actual events. in other bio pics such as Patton or Ghandi the actual names of the participants of these historical events are used, why not in this movie? the answer is simple, if they used the proper names they would be obligated to stick to the facts of this interesting and historically relevant case. since this was never the intent, the expedience of changing the names offered deniability as to the actual identities of the characters portrayed. in my final analysis this is a well acted well made propaganda film not worth the time it will take to watch it. it certainly should be banned from ever being played to school children as factual! revisionist rubbish!"
"""Inherit the Wind"" makes for an undeniably good watch. Its inspiration, the Scopes Trial of 1925, holds inherent fascination and (depressingly) ongoing relevance, as evidenced by the recent battle in Dover. Two great actors, Spencer Tracy and Fredric March, get to play parts bursting with juice in the tastiest of dramatic settings, a courtroom. Even mediocre courtroom dramas are usually watchable -- trials are instant theater -- but the Scopes Trial was heaven-sent for a scenarist: crackling dialogue, charged issues, and a pair of titans at the center. Clarence Darrow and William Jennings Bryan were both masterful performers, two real-life one-man shows. No playwright could hope to invent better.But the script hedges its bets. The hit stage play that spawned the film nominally fictionalized the story and the characters to avoid the necessity of absolute historical accuracy, and that's fine. Dramatic compression and embellishment are the norm even without the veneer of fiction. But here we have a case of both too much and not enough, and the result distorts not just the facts but the social issues at stake.Henry Drummond (the Darrow character) and Matthew Brady (Bryan) aren't exactly impenetrably disguised.  Ditto E. W. Hornbeck (played by Gene Kelly), a famous, cynical Baltimore journalist who arrives to kibitz and mock the proceedings... well exactly how many famous cynical Baltimore journalists are there? The script freely appropriates biographical details, trial tidbits (like the squabble over Brady's ""colonel"" title), and whole chunks of dialogue straight from the court transcript. Yet frustratingly the screenwriters can't leave well enough alone.The real John Scopes was approached by a group of local citizens eager to get Dayton, TN on the national radar. He agreed to be a test case to allow the ACLU to challenge the state's statutory ban on teaching evolution. The ban was hardly a hot-button issue; it was being quietly ignored by teachers and indeed by the legislature itself. The text that Scopes taught was not only already in use but in fact required by state law.But the movie takes the popcorn route: the teacher Gates (Dick York) is a lone crusader for truth, while the townspeople are a monolithic fundamentalist entity, all but gnashing their teeth in eagerness for a lynching. Worse, the script invents a fiancée for Gates, and -- gasp! -- she's the daughter of the fiery town minister! It's enough to make you groan. The dramatic signposting in these scenes is so obvious that it amounts to an insult. We KNOW the issue is divisive; there's all those people yelling. The subplot's too heavy-handed to be poignant so you just sit through it and wait for Tracy and March to show up again.The resolution (following a terrific and reasonably accurate witness box showdown) similarly feels forced and false, as does the final scene between Drummond and Hornbeck/Mencken (which feels like a writer's afterthought to ""balance the message""). Kelly has a natural big-city dash that is quite effective in the role -- dapper and graceful, he shows up like a neon sign in the rural setting. A local woman asks him if he needs ""a nice clean place to stay."" He doffs his boater, smiles sweetly, and replies, ""I had a nice clean place to stay, ma'am, but I left it to come here."" It's funny, and fleetingly you can imagine what the movie might have been like with somebody like Preston Sturges in charge to seize on the satirical possibilities of the events. But the authors and director Stanley Kramer are too well-intentioned to empathize with the H. L. Menckens of the world, so Hornbeck's snarky cynicism earns him an inevitable condemnation as well. (Stanley Kramer may never have had a bad intention in his life. He was the anti-John Waters.)So we're here to be taught a lesson about bigotry, ignorance, and the sacredness of truth. Yet the truth gets compromised, a baffling choice when the reality contains enough drama for five movies. At one point Brady, cornered by Drummond, announces: ""I do not think about things I don't think about."" Drummond returns, ""Do you think about things you DO think about?"", to which the flustered Brady blurts, ""Well, sometimes."" The lines have a classic screenwriter's ring, too good to be true -- and they come verbatim from Darrow and Bryan. With material like that, who needs fiction?"
"""Inherit the Wind"" may be the best example of Hollywood's general policy of not letting actual facts get in the way of telling a ""true"" story when over-the-top melodrama is the goal.Spencer Tracy never looked worse than in this film, with his pants pulled up to his chest and his egg-beater hairstyle. But that is nit-picking a minor problem with what is supposed to be part of the intended charm of the story...the outnumbered, rumpled defender of common sense versus the ignorant religious nuts. Ironically, the intent of the film would have been far better served by a more straight-forward telling of the actual historical events of the events that this movie represents. (You can easily check the internet for what really happened before, during, and after the Scopes trial). Instead, the gross caricatures of fundamentalist ""Christians"" stereotyped as bug-eyed, lynch-mob fanatics, coupled with the smirking, sanctimonious pontificating of the Tracy and Gene Kelley characters, results in something that comes across more like hysterical propaganda than effective historical storytelling.But my biggest objections to this movie are with regard to its pretension as court-room drama. Call me crazy, but to me the makings of a good courtroom drama include lawyers skillfully and cleverly presenting evidence, craftily examining and cross-examining witnesses, and developing strategies that will challenge the jurors, and have them, along with the viewers, swaying back and forth between a proclamation of guilt and innocence. Think of ""Anatomy of a Murder"" or ""The Verdict."" ""Inherit the Wind"" doesn't come within the same universe of films like those. All we get in the courtroom is emotional preaching and pontificating - by both sides.The gross simplification of the characters and the issues, the general lack of subtlety, and the unchecked melodrama leaves me wondering how a film like this can attain the status it has."
"A brilliant dramatization of the Scopes Monkey Trial, one that takes a few liberties with history but gets the essence of it right. It's mind-blowing how relevant the clash between evolution/creationism in schools continues to be, and in a larger sense, the film is a defense of science, intellectuals, and freedom of thought. It's also a cautionary tale of the literal interpretation of the Bible vs. its use as a spiritual guide, and the danger of the mob. I loved the performances from Spencer Tracy and Frederic March as (essentially) Clarence Darrow and William Jennings Bryan, and even with their fundamental differences of opinion, how the two are civil and friendly to one another, which is just as important as a lesson."
"Before deciding to read this review, know I mention certain scenes in this review. Please skip this review if you want to avoid this, but know I think you should definitely see this brilliant movie!Inherit the Wind is one of the finest religious-themed movies ever made. I just watched it for the 2nd time in my life today on TCM, and it's even better the second time!The movie, which derives it's name from Proverbs 11:29(""He who causes trouble on his family will only inherit the wind""), is a fictional retelling of the Scopes Trial from 1928, where a high school teacher was arrested for teaching Darwinian evolution against Tennessee state law.There are many objectors to this movie due to the fact that the movie fudges many of the actual historical facts. Well, was there a nude drawing that took place on the Titanic? Did Pocahontas have a romance with John Smith and ""paint with all the colors of the wind?""No, and yet Titanic and Pocahontas are both beloved movies! While I am against biblical inaccuracies, I have no issues with that done with histories since the spirit of such stories still remain.In the courtroom, the intended purpose is to decide if the teacher should go to jail for teaching kids of a religious town ""that man descended from a low order of animals"" as the police put it, or could there me more to the Earth's formation than just the beginning of Genesis?Many aspects of both sides are debated in court. Henry Drummond, the evolutionist defending the side, has arguments such as the teacher has a right to think bout what he wants to believe, there is geological evidence for evolution, etc.Creationism is defended by Matthew Harrison Brady, a politician who refuses to even consider a belief against biblical theology. His main argument is that the Bible is true, and it's correct simply because he says so. He is so stubborn in his position, he even directly states that he would never even read Darwin's book On The Origin of Species.So both sides fight like cats and dogs, until an official position on the case can be concluded.My favorite scene is an argument where Drummond actually puts Brady on trial as a witness. He asks him if events in the Bible can really occur-can Jonah be swallowed by a big fish and live? Can Joshua make the sun stand still and not affect astrological function? If the Bible says one event of creation took a day-can it be a full 24 hour day if the sun was not made until day 3?Brady then realizes that there may be a reason for other ideas of the beginning of time...which he finds upsetting.The movie ends with Drummond smacking a Bible and Origin of Species together. There are different interpretations of what this means, I personally think it means that evolution and Biblical creationism will always be believed by different people.As a creationist myself, I really take this to heart. I will always believe in creation, but as Brady learns, maybe there is a reason to at least listen to the other side. We get into trouble otherwise. And ""he who causes trouble on his family will only inherit the wind.""Final verdict: This is the best courtroom drama of all time and a must see for anyone!"
My Rating : 7/10Darwin was wrong. Man is still an ape. An excellent courtroom drama.
"Too bad the battle over evolution still seethes in certain parts of the country, which means the movie still has topicality. This earnest version of the famous Scopes trial recounts that milestone event Stanley Kramer style, which means the message comes through loud and clear. It's an actor's hothouse, two hours of dialog with little action except for the marching mobs. Tracy wisely low-keys it much of the time while March, unfortunately, sometimes borders on loud-mouth parody. At the same time, Kelly manages the professional cynic in amiable style. And I really like York as the skinny, slightly befuddled teacher whose dedication to science in the classroom causes the big ruckus. Then there's the rather plain- faced Donna Anderson (Rachel) shrewdly cast as Cates' (York) girl friend, but more importantly, functions as the town's barometer of opinion.All in all, there's no doubt whose side the movie's on. At times the backwoods fundamentalists are near caricatures, aggressively smug in their trust in the Bible and loud rejection of science as to humanity's origin. But it's important to note that Drummond's (Tracy) basically arguing for freedom of thought and not atheism per-se. Doing the latter would, of course, have spelled box-office doom. Still, it was pretty gutsy of Kramer to take on biblical literalism, even in 1960. In fact, Drummond's religious views are never made clear, though Kramer has him add the Bible to Darwin's tome as the movie closes.I think it's fair to say that the movie takes a basically liberal position toward religion and reason, rejecting only that which cannot stand up to science. All in all, it's a histrionic powerhouse that at times fairly crackles with emotional give and take in an epic cultural clash."
"""I didn't come here to make Hillsboro different. I came here to defend the right to be different. And that's the point."" Based on a real-life case in 1925, two great lawyers argue the case for and against a science teacher accused of the crime of teaching evolution. Starring Dick York, Spencer Tracy and Gene Kelly.The people of Hillsboro were caught between (in their view) defending the Lord and saving face as the country ridiculed them. Popular opinion is a strong thing, but if you have a conviction, you should stand up for it. So I can understand both sides of the issue in that light.The film makes it seem as though the whole world accepts evolution aside from this small community, which is just not the case. Over fifty years later, a considerable percentage of the country accepts some version of creation. A newspaper making the bold pro-evolution claims that we see in this film, even if done today, would get some concerned letters. The Catholic Church may accept evolution as of the 1950s, but this does not mean the people in the pews do.Today we see some parallels with intelligent design. A pro-Darwin argument could be that all ideas should be presented, whether right or wrong, to let the students decide. Today, this is much the point of the intelligent design group. The difference is that Darwin is backed by science, of course. (I hesitate to go further for fear of offending anyone.) What a wonder about films with political messages is whether all the actors support the messages or simply accept the role as part of their job. It would certainly seem that to be part of a film means you endorse it, but I am unsure. Gary Cooper starred in ""High Noon"" while remaining anti-communist, so it is hard to say for certain where a job ends and a conviction begins.I do have to say the judge in the film is remarkably fair. One might expect him to naturally side with the people of Hillsboro, but he is pretty even-handed. He sustains objections that a more biased judge might let slide. I am impressed. The argument against the literal interpretation of the Bible is very well stated, and the judge probably should have stepped in at some point during this... it is quite the badgering of a witness, and of questionable relevancy. (Although, the prosecution at no time objected, so they are at fault, too.)"
"Okay, let me make one thing perfectly clear: The characters had to be different from their inspirations for LEGAL reasons! This film may not be historically sound, but that is, again for legal reasons so don't make a fuss. The people of Dayton (Hillsboro in the film) weren't acting any different, read a history book. For the most part, people who have been spitting on this film are religious and there is nothing wrong with that. Funny thing, the movie doesn't disagree. The movie does speak poorly of the insanely fanatical religious, but not of people who are religious. TRACY'S CHARACTER TURNS OUT TO BE JUST AS MUCH A BELIEVER AS THE NEXT MAN AND TRIES TO MAKE A POINT THAT BOTH EVOLUTION AND CREATION COULD POSSIBLY BE TRUE. And considering what many of the people with negative comments because of (misunderstood) religious implications have probably said about Islamic fanatics in the Mid. East they really should think twice.The people who seem to hate this movie because ""it's to boring"" might be happier with the latest summer ""boobs and blood"" film."
"Although Fredric March and Spencer Tracy had been acting in films for some time before Inherit the Wind, each turns in such a masterly performance here, it is as if they were inventing acting from scratch. These men ARE Brady and Drummond, by the end of the film they are as familiar to us as if we met them on the street. Kramer's direction is understated and let's the language of the play itself propel the movie forward; and a powerful play it is, part historical retrospect, part philosophical confrontation.A note on the historical and legal problems with which the play deals. A couple of reviewers complain about some historical inaccuracy, and apparently there's even a fundamentalist web-site set up to 'debunk' the film.This is a film, based on a play, and hence a work of fiction. It is thus not required to present the Scopes trial with historical accuracy. The play did draw not only on the newspaper accounts of the Scopes trial, but much of the trial dialog is in fact lifted from court records - which are still available in some libraries, and in public records. Yet the purpose of the play, and thus the movie, is dramatic, not journalistic.It is notable that one such reviewer claimed the 'evidence' presented by Drummond was discredited - demonstrating that he had not seen the movie, since Drummond is not allowed to present evidence, but merely ask questions of Brady that Brady can not answer.The legal issues of the play may also be obscured in our culturally regressive era, when so few Americans understand their own Constitutional government and its justice system. Although at issue is a State law applied in a local court, both Drummond and the judge (masterfully played by Henry Morgan in his finest supporting performance) understand what the prosecutors, including Brady, choose to ignore - since the ultimate issue is a matter of Constitutional law, failure before the jury (which is inevitable) is not the end but the beginning - Drummond is merely playing the first move in a game of repeated appeals ultimately leading to the Supreme Court. He would certainly have preferred placing scientific testimony into the record at the start, but he settles for Brady's incoherent religious fanaticism, since what is at issue is the separation of church and state. Religion cannot be allowed to determine law - or education - in a pluralistic society because religious faith is incoherent as social policy, and frequently in conflict with opposing interpretations.Oh, by the way, the best evidence for evolution happens to be genetic mutation, not dinosaur fossils. But fossils now really have this importance: if the carbon dating of fossils is ineffective, then obviously radioactivity is ineffective, and nuclear power never happened.It is sad that children like Brady - or Palin or Robertson, et al - choose to befuddle their followers (just for the sake of their own aggrandizement) into believing they live in an era before technology and science effectively reinforce each other. It remains a curiosity that supposed 'Christians' continue to speak falsehoods while practicing some weird paganism masquerading as ""literal word of God."" Can God's ""day"" be 12 million human years long? Isn't it disrespectful to God to assume otherwise? Augustine said God is outside of any time at all, thus such measure is irrelevant to his being; Ambrose thought it possible that God regenerated the universe in its entirety every moment, making such measure irrelevant to our being. If it matters to a scientist for the sake of greater investigation, discovery, invention, then let us travel that road, since such concerns God only insofar as he loves us and these benefit us - if He fears such discoveries, or would deny us such benefit, ""then he is not God, and we have nothing to fear"" (as the hero of Scott's ""Kingdom of Heaven"" remarks).The theory of evolution was among the theories that medical scientists were able to use to develop such benefits as penicillin and the polio vaccine. Those unwilling to live with Darwin are free to abjure these benefits as well. But they are NOT free to deny these benefits to me or my family - including the benefit of a good secular education with scientific (not spuriously 'religious')foundations.The teaching of evolution in publicly funded schools is Constitutional; the teaching of Creationism, or other religious credo, is not. Those unhappy with that may withdraw their children into private church-sponsored schools where they can be kept ignorant as rocks.Following the State Supreme Court's attempt to preserve the law while remarking it as 'poorly written,' and overturning Scopes' conviction, the ultimate result of the Scopes trial on which this film is based, was for the law to be repealed by the state legislature as unenforcible.""The first major court battle over evolution in the federal courts was decided in 1968, when the United States Supreme Court ruled in Epperson v. Arkansas that a state statute prohibiting the teaching of evolution was unconstitutional because it catered to a religious doctrine, thereby violating the establishment clause of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution."" From www.tungate.com/evolution_court_cases.htm"
"This film, more than any other single factor, affected my way of thinking about Life, Religion, and everything. The message of Inherit the Wind is, if anything, even more relevant in the new millennium as the forces of legislated morality strive ever harder to write their particular mythology into the legal fabric of our country.It is sad that these self-righteous, pious individuals fail to recognize that the only reason their own religions are allowed to exist is because of the very freedoms that allowed Bertram Cates to speak his mind in this superb rendering of a classic play. As Henry Drummond says when talking about suppression of speech and thought by one ideology toward another, ""...if you can do one, then you can do the other."" Truth is, and shall always be, in the eye of the beholder. You cannot and should not attempt to cram your Truth down the throat of another."
"Inherit the Wind directed by Stanley Kramer in 1960 was based on the play of the same name by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee.  They wrote Inherit the Wind as a response to the threat to intellectual freedom presented by the anti-communist hysteria of the McCarthy era.  The movie depicts the famous Scopes trial where schoolteacher John T. Scopes in movie Bertram T. Cates (Dick York) was arrested in Hillsboro, Tennessee for teaching Darwin's theory of evolution, which was against state law.  The law forbade the teaching of any doctrine denying the divine creation of man as taught by the bible. The trial shows the confrontation between fundamentalist literal belief of the bible and people who believed the bible was allegory or myth. The attorney paid for by Baltimore journalist E.K. Hornbeck (Gene Kelly) for the defense was the famed trial lawyer Henry Drummond (Spencer Tracy) and the prosecutor was the orator and statesman Matthew Harrison Brady (Fredric March).  The trial is set to decide whether God's word or the word of science should be taught in school.Inherit the Wind does not purport to be a historically accurate depiction of the Scopes trial. The place names and names of trial participants have been changed.  The trial actually took place in Dayton, Tennessee not Hillsboro, Tennessee, but the carnival like atmosphere surrounding the trial did exist. The case should not have gone as far as it did, but it was a publicty stunt by the people of Dayton.  Lest there be any doubt, even the pattern of the names and the number of syllables in each name carefully match the real names of the people they purport to portray.  The prosecutor, Matthew Harrison Brady, represents William Jennings Bryan from the real event is portrayed as an almost comical fanatic who dramatically dies of a heart attack while attempting to deliver his summation in a chaotic courtroom. The Bryan actually died five days later after the trial ended of a cerebral hemorage not a `busted belly' as said in the movie.  Bryan had in fact run for president three times as said in the movie (1896, 1900, and 1908).  He was a democrat who appealed to the common man including many farmers and was the secretary of state before.  Fredric March's physical portrayal of the balding Bryan bears a striking resemblance as well.  Furthermore, Henry Drummond is actually the famed defense lawyer Clarence Darrow.  Darrow was a great defense attorney from Chicago who opposed the fyndamentalist beliefs of his rival Bryan.  He had been in many important cases in his years as an attorney but the Scopes trial was his last case.  Darrow is less cynical and biting than as his Drummond character he was shown.  In addition, the journalist E.K. Hornbeck from the Baltimore Herald is actually H.L. Menkein from the Baltimore Sun.  H.L. Menkein did work with the Baltimore Herald, but in 1906, he switched to the Baltimore Sun long before the Scopes Trial. Menkein was a great writer and and incredible intellectual.  He was accurately portrayed as a biting, sarcastic critic in the film.  As mentioned above, John T. Scopes is shown as Bertam T. Cates in the film. Scopes actually was not even a real teacher but rather a long-term substitute teacher instead.  After the trial he never taught school again and became a geologist.  In an effort to dramatize the movie several fictional characters were created, including a fundamentalist preacher, Reverand Jeremiah Brown, and his daughter, Rachel Brown, who is the fiancé of John Scopes. The townspeople of fictional Hillsboro are far more frenzied, mean-spirited, and ignorant than were the real denizens of Dayton.Some theatrical liberties were exercised in developing the plot but the courtroom screenplay was adapted word for word from the transcript of the Scopes trial.  The events that take place around the courtroom drama are largely fictional.  The movie begins with John Scopes getting caught teaching evolution and he is indicted for breaking the law against teaching evolution.  Scopes is immediately jailed and remains in jail throughout the trial.  Where as in reality no one ever intruded in John Scopes' classroom. Scopes was not kept in jail as shown and he only agreed to a trial because he thought it would be very low key.  The law that provided the basis for Scopes' arrest in Tennessee was the Butler Act.  The Butler Act was rarely enforced and was only an issue because the ACLU approached Scopes.  During the trial, it was in fact very hot and the people had fans.  The trial which went on for several weeks not just a few days as the film made it seem was moved outside to deal with the excessive heat.  Scopes was found guilty and ordered to pay a fine of one hundred dollars. Later, on appeal, the state Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law but acquitted Scopes on the technicality that he had been fined excessively. The Butler Actwas finally repealed in 1967.  William Jennings Bryan died five days after the initial trial not on the courtroom floor as depicted in the film.  This was the first major trial that radio was a part of and the involvement of radio was accurately depicted in the movie.  The material culture was very accurate.  The suits, broad brimmed hats, and suspenders of the men were accurately depicted.  The wearing of shifty, loose dresses by the women was well done too.  The lawyers and men in the court did ask to take their coats off, as socially at the time the coat was an important component of men's clothes.  The film was very well produced and incorporates song components that better set the feeling for the time-period of the movie.Inherit the Wind in following closely on the heels of the McCarthy era, was very much an allegory of its time.  This dimension is fully exploited by Kramer and his screenwriters. Indeed, if he film can be faulted at all, it is on this level: The townspeople seems a trifle too bigoted, while Drummond's unrelenting altruism is equally suspect.  Just the right degree of cynical detachment is brought to the pivotal role of E. K. Hornbeck without once sacrificing the empathy of the audience.  Kramer's version therefore, becomes an affirmation of the worth of all people, modernist, or fundamentalist, orthodox and progressive. Even the final scene is an attempt to downplay this cultural conflict and look for some consensus. As Drummond walks out of the courtroom, with the Bible and Darwin side by side in his briefcase, an old religious hymn begins to play. As `Glory, Glory Hallelujah' echoes throughout the courtroom, this atheist evolutionist, defender of the modernist viewpoint, seems more religious than ever.Technically this film was very sound.  The use of black and white color sets the audience in the early 20th century scene in the great South of America. Stanley Kreimer is quite a fine director with many movies to his credit and his talents were fully displayed in Inherit the Wind.  Using many visuals and signs throughout the length of the movie, the film is clear and easy to follow.Overall, I thought that Inherit the Wind is a very valuable film. It is not the most entertaining film for modern audiences but if you enjoy classic acting and a classic plot this film is definitely for you.  I feel that all students should view this movie at some point in time for their own educational purposes.  For to fully understand why they are learning certain ideas in school as opposed to others and the struggle that has insued to determine which ideas should be taught in our schools. This trial raised for the first time in people's mind the question of academic freedom of speech and may do the same for modern viewers facing similar problems with the educational system that conflict with their own personal beliefs."
"""Inherit the Wind"" is a rare thing - a truly wonderful film that doesn't re-write history TOO much. The issue addressed here continues to be topical--the power of a State to dictate exactly what dogma may or may not be taught in a public school.The bone of contention in the real-life 1925 trial, starring William Jennings Bryan and Clarance Darrow, was the so-called Butler Act. In March of 1925 the Tennessee legislature had declared unlawful the teaching of any doctrine denying the divine creation of man as taught by the Bible. The trial has often been called ""The Scopes Monkey Trial.""World attention focused on the trial proceedings, which promised confrontation between Fundamentalist literal belief and liberal interpretation of the Scriptures.Even after making Bryan look foolish on the stand, Darrow lost the case because Scopes admitted he broke the law. Darrow became world famous as a result of this trial.Just a few points are omitted from the original play, and the film.What was not clear to many was that John Scopes was encouraged by the ACLU to intentionally break this law so it could be tested in a public trial. This strategy backfired, however, when the judge ruled out any test of the law's constitutionality or argument on the validity of Darwin's theory, limiting the trial to the single question of whether or not Scopes had taught evolution, which he admittedly had.Scopes was convicted and fined $100. On appeal, the state supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the 1925 law but acquitted Scopes on the technicality that he had been fined excessively. The law was repealed in 1967.Note the law stood for forty-two years AFTER the trial."
"Jerome Lawrence made the timely decision to remove the Scopes Monkey Trial of 1925 and place it in the middle of the Red Scare of the 1950s where a rabid mob of people convinced of their superiority tried to impose their beliefs on the rest of the country.  Inherit the Wind still takes place in the 1920s and the issue is still evolution, but the extreme right-wing mania is undeniably a reflection of the paranoia andbitter hate of the witch-hunters.Tracy and March make sparks fly in a 15-minute scene where Drummond grills Brady and leaves nothing but a shuddering wreck of a once-great, but stubborn and narrow-minded man.  Tracy expertly brings Darrow's banteringly sarcastic courtroom manner to the screen as he lays the trap for his adversary.  Gene Kelly, in a surprising departure for him, plays sarcastic reporter, E.K. Hornbeck (in reality, H.L. Mencken) effectively."
"The film Inherit the Wind is an adaptation of a play of the same name that enjoyed some success on Broadway in the fifties. The movie version is respectful to its source, and I'm not sure why. As a play it wasn't much, and as a movie it is, well, not dull as dishwater but dreadfully mediocre, trying awfully hard to please everyone in the audience at once. Why try to please everyone,--or even anyone? Why not just make a good movie and let the chips fall where they may? As most people know the play and film were about the famous Tennessee 'monkey trial' in the twenties, when the forces of Good (the Bible thumpers) and the voice of Darwin (the pointy-headed intellctuals and city folk) came to blows in a small court-house. The former were represented by former presidential candidate and national icon William Jennings Bryan, while the latter were served by famous trial lawyer Clarence Darrow. The issue was whether a high school teacher could intruct his pupils in the theory of evolution. A heated and bitter debate ensued between these two aging titans, and though he won, Bryan left courtroom a broken man and died shortly thereafter. The movie highlights the trial, and is at its best during the the exchanges between the Darrow and Bryan characters (the names were changed for legal reasons). Stanley Kramer produced and directed the film and is to blame for its poor quality. Kramer was in his heyday a daring producer, but never much of a director, and in this film his flaws are glaringly apparent. He has no feeling for the camera, no editing sense, he doesn't know how to build tension, has no sense of time or place, and he is blind to nuance and subtlety. This film is incredibly flat and obvious, and it's as preachy as old Bryan himself out on the Chatauqua circuit, though it offers a more 'enlightened' and 'thoughtful' viewpoint. Essentially one watches the film to see Bryan go down, just as in old-time melodramas one wanted to see the snarling villain get his just desserts, as they used to say. The acting is mostly pedestrian and uninteresting, and a lot of key supporting roles are weirdly miscast. Spencer Tracy performance as the Darrow character, though, is quite good, rising above both the script and the director's too-indulgent handling of his star. Tracy really rallied for this late entry in his canon, and while he's a far cry from the charming rogue he was twenty or thirty years earlier, he's still as charismatic as ever, always commanding and deserving of respect. Fredric March is a disaster as Bryan, and I wondered when watching his god-awful, hammy performance why he was ever thought of as a good let alone great actor. March is a Western Union actor, telegraphing and underlining each response to the action. His double-takes and the gurgling noises he frequently deploys are meant to indicate a.) confusion, and b.) insecurity. I found myeslf continually talking to him, saying things like, ""Yes, Freddie old boy, we got it the first time"". The same should have been said to Stanley Kramer when the film was being made, ""Okay, Stan, I understand. We have to learn to trust one another and respect our differences"". But in 1960, when the film was made, Hollywood was getting quite serious, even solemn about certain topics, tolerance being one of them. Inherit the Wind was a harbinger of the sort of movie soon to come,--To Kill a Mockingbird, Fail-Safe, The Best Man, The Birdman Of Alcatraz--and as such isn't even a very good example of its type, as unlike it successor films it has neither wit or even the faux-Bohemianism of these loping dinosaurs of the New Frontier and Great Society."
"This film is absolutely marvellous. Never the stupid ideas of religious fanaticism have been better portrayed. To view it should be a duty in EVERY school to see how the opression of ""right and moral majority"" can be worst than the Nazi regime.Spencer Tracy is fantastic performing the Drummond/Darrow lawyer and Gene Kelly has a brilliant and edged speech that cuts like a knife! I'd like to be as his character!State of Kansas: go to see this movie! Maybe you'll learn something and you'll leave the 19th Century!My rate:  10 / 10."
"In this day and age, you wouldn't think we'd put up with a film that incites hate against a group of people by using an unfair stereotype. We wouldn't put up with a work of Nazi propaganda that demonizes Jews, or a story that celebrates the lynching of a black man, or one that portrays gangs of ""fags"" preying on young men.Well, it may sound extremist to say this, because we're not used to thinking in these terms, but such works would hardly be any worse than INHERIT THE WIND's portrayal of Christians is. WIND is especially harmful because so many people think it's a true story where only the names have been changed. But the actual Scopes Trial did not happen as WIND portrays it; in particular, the actions of WIND's ""religious villains"" are not based on reality whatsoever. People often mention the Scopes Trial to make a point, thinking WIND is an accurate account of it, but its actual events would not support their viewpoint at all. What the real trial mainly showed is the extent to which some -- in this case, those who used Scopes and Darrow -- will play dirty to achieve their end.There's no telling how many seeds of bigotry WIND, whether as a movie or a play, has sown. No doubt it has contributed to the damage that EXPELLED has begun to try to clean up. If we really want to oppose works of fiction that promote intolerance, WIND should be at the top of the list. Whatever its merits may be in the areas of acting, production, etc., they are more than countered by its false and destructive message."
"Movies like this are rare.. they come along every ten years. Actors like this are rare. Stories like this are rare. The point is– the film is still as fresh now as when it was made. As I write this we have a President Trump telling Congress he's going to repeal Medical Care for the poor. A bunch of Congressmen rise to cheer him. In the film, a teacher is charged with teaching Darwin's Law of Evolution to his high school students. He's put in jail. A bunch of fundamentalist southerners rise to cheer for it.Trump and his supporters want to march America backwards into the 19th century. Wall Street runs the country. He's has a few things right and 90% wrong. His lawyer was Roy Cohn, a sidekick of Joe McCarthy. Would that we had men like Clarence Darrow (played by Spencer Tracy) now, or even actors like Spencer Tracy and Frederick March to fight for us now. We need men and women like these giants.Marching backward never works in history. It always leads to eventual revolutions and lurches forward, or sometimes to a bad place.""Inherit the Wind"" is about an attempt to march backward, and a clear courtroom battle of the issues of Darwin's Law of Evolution vs religious fundamentalism written into the law of the land. Sad to say, these issues, and more, are still with us now– 50 years after this great film was made. ."
"I first saw this movie shortly after it came out in 1960. I was a kid and it was shown on television. It was through this movie that I first learned about the Scopes trial.Now, 50 years later, what I see is not a ""docudrama,"" but rather a truly remarkable movie that conveys the terror of closed minds and a world where men and women are not free to carry on rational thought. It is like Orwell's 1984, or Fahrenheit 451: the story of a society that tries to repress free thought.That alone would make it a powerful story, but it is the way Kramer put it together that makes it the masterpiece that it is. What struck me this time was his use of hymns and some of the crowd scenes, which truly portray this small town world as one capable of violence and hatred, of completely irrational lack of thought, in a chilling way. Yes, when the preacher damns his own daughter to hell chills go down your spine. But so many of the scenes are so effective.Supporting this masterful direction is brilliant screen dialogue. Some of the speeches accorded the two stars are as fine as anything in any movie I have seen.And then there is the acting of Frederic March and Spencer Tracy. Two masters of their craft performing brilliantly. Gene Kelly also does a great job with the often too cynical journalist.Once this movie gets going, you can't stop watching. There is not a wasted moment. It is truly one remarkable movie."
"Watch this movie, and one of the summer offerings of 2001, and ask yourself, ""Is the dumbing down of America true?""  Hint: Yep, since we decided to elevate ignorance to a level paralleling our 'religiosity' (which hides a lot of hatred under pious hypocrisy), we have become dumber and dumber. Dayton, Tenn. where the Scopes trial was held is close to my birthplace. Tracy and March do a superior job of playing the old war-horses, who have also been friends at another time.  The young Dick York (in his pre-AIDs acting days) plays Scopes.  All have pseudonyms, which makes me wonder.  Why was it necessary?  The acting and screenplay and direction by Stanly Kramer are all superb. In a book on Stanley Kramer, the author says that it is still against the law in Tenn. to teach evolution.!!!!Noting that there was a time when 'Does it make money?' did not represent an excuse to rape the planet and cheat the consumer, we see the banker offering to back the farmer, who offers to put up bail for Tracey (playing Clarence Darrow).  He also makes the wonderful point that ""If our town is seen to be ignorant, industry will not come here, and our children will not be accepted into Ivy League schools"".  Hey, morality always was based on economics. The girl playing Scope's fiance does NOT speak 'Southern'.  Why is my accent so hard to emulate?  You hear it from every politican in DC, just about, which is probably why I'm thought to be ignorant by people who listen to me speak. And I understand why.The only fake note in the film is the final scene.  The H.L. Mencken character (Gene Kelly) left behind a well-thumbed Bible, although he was as much as agnostic as I am.  Darrow was an atheist, yet Tracy ends this excellent film preaching a bunch of pap to Kelly about 'being miserable unless you believe in something'.  That wasn't true to either of the real people being depicted.  Many of us agnostics pray more sincerely and as often as any Bible-totin' church-goin' hypocrite.This movie won beacoup awards, as well it should.  It went a little over the top with the good townspeople parading through Dayton waving torches, and yelling for Darrow's and Scopes' heads, even throwing a rock at the jail window, breaking it ....with no repercussions.  No, you don't have to demonize the 'good, respectable people of small-town Tenness'.  The point is better made when you keep them human, as we all have this mob mentality/psychosis within us.  Read any treatise on 'group psychology' and it's apparent.I watched this movie, and will have to go at it again, now that I've read the various encyclopedia treatments of the Scopes trial.  Are our kids even being taught about this anymore?  Are the children of Kansas being taught about ignorance/religiosity?. With the appallingly low standards we have for teachers now, accompanied by their appallingly low salaries, it's a wonder that anyone would have the courage to bring up such a 'controversial' subject. Having been raised in the Bible Belt, I am more appalled as time goes by at the evil done and still being committed under the guise of Christianity. And Jesus wept."
"While this movie is outstanding across the board: writing, set designs, cinematography, supporting cast (even the uncredited actors are good) and Leslie Uggams rendition of ""Give Me That Old Time Religion"", I barely notice those things in this movie. This movie, for me, is a two man show. Spencer Tracy and Frederic March play off of each other to perfection. Tracy received a much deserved Oscar nomination for his performance but I think Frederic March was probably even better. Later versions, e.g. the recent made for TV one with Jack Lemmon and George C. Scott, pale in comparison with the power these two great actors bring to their roles. I rank their performances with those of Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke in ""The Miracle Worker""."
"Inherit the Wind is a beautiful, artistic movie.  This is a film that stimulates the mind with thought provoking ideas.  Among many other ponderings, it suggests that fighting for a cause can be crucial, while fighting individual people will only result in pain.March, Tracy and Kelly are a spectacularly dynamic trio, each making his character a vital mix of human emotions, transcending the black and white in which the world sees him.  We as viewers are presented with this concept through the black and white cinematography itself.The material around which the story is centered is naturally controversial, even today.  It's actually quite impressive that a movie studio was willing to pay for its production in 1960. No matter your beliefs, this is a movie every thinking person owes it to him or herself to see."
"INHERIT THE WIND is a history drama about a controversial but somewhat theatrical judicial conflict between the two well-known lawyers, or conflict between religion and science. The film is based on the famous Scopes ""Monkey"" Trial. Mr. Kramer has tried to indirectly criticize McCarthyism through themes in this movie.In a small Southern town, a school teacher is about to stand trial. He has violated state law by introducing to his students the concept that man descended from the lower life forms. He was condemned by all city officials, religious communities and almost all citizens. The prosecutor is a noted statesman, three-time presidential candidate and a Biblical scholar. The teacher's defense is one of America's most controversial legal minds. The trial is open to the public. There is room for one cynical journalist. Madness can begin ...The judicial conflict full of enthusiasm and personal disagreements has exceeded the limits of the courtroom. That is the biggest asset of this film. Subjects is too controversial for such a trial. Of course, there is, always present, political background. An amount of demagogy and ignorance is justified in this film. This problem is evident in all spheres of life. This can be explained through an aggressive imposition of certain opinions or conclusions. The trial is not realistic, conflicts are very passionate, but judicial decision is important. There are no winners in this showdown. Well, maybe politics .... It's ironic.Spencer Tracy as Henry Drummond is a calm, eloquent and poised as teacher's defender. Character, who in addition to law and justice tries to hit the truth. Fredric March as Matthew Harrison Brady is a loud and passionate demagogue. The prosecutor, who uses religious environment and ignorance of people for an overly theatrical performance. A bigoted duel has ended with emphasis on human dignity. Gene Kelly as E. K. Hornbeck is a resourceful and brisk journalist. He supports, despite his cynicism and irony, one side of an ideology.Mr. Kramer has caught the essence, however, consider this film as a conflict between the traditional and the modern or the past and the future is not serious."
"This film is a reworking and dramatization of the so-called 'Scopes Monkey Trial' which was held in Dayton, Tennessee in 1925. It's about a teacher who was prosecuted for teaching evolution--even though the state legislature prohibited this at the time. ""Inherit the Wind"" is a very good film. I liked the acting of Spencer Tracy and most of the characters (though Frederic March did seem to overact a tad). However, as I watched, it became obvious that it was based on a play and the historical accuracy wasn't that important. Again and again, the film stresses big moments and soliloquies over the actual story. This isn't so much a complaint-- more about the style of the film as well as its being seen as a history lesson when it really isn't. After all, if it's supposed to be a history lesson, why not use the real names of the characters?! Why not say that the lawyers are William Jennings Bryan and Clarence Darrow and that the defendant is Mr. Scopes?"
"Ever since Charles Darwin published his ""On the Origin of Species"" in 1859, which established evolution by common descent as the dominant scientific explanation of diversification in nature, fierce debate has raged on the validity of his evolutionary theories, and their effect upon religious doctrine. Fortunately, given the research of Darwin and Wallace, as well as Mendel's studies of genetic inheritance  not to mention a host of equally-important scientists who followed  evolution is now almost universally accepted as a proved scientific theory. However, back in 1925, a considerable proportion of intelligent and educated individuals simply refused to believe that man and ape had descended from a common ancestor, and many people's complete reliance on the Bible implied that any conflicting theories must certainly be incorrect and, needless to say, blasphemous. At this time, the Tennessee legislature passed a law that forbade the teaching, in state-funded schools, of ""any theory that denies the story of the Divine Creation of man as taught in the Bible, and to teach instead that man has descended from a lower order of animals."" A young teacher, John Scopes, was charged with this precise crime, and the ensuing court case is often known as the ""Scopes Monkey Trial.""In 1955, Jerome Lawrence and Robert Edwin Lee first adapted the trial into a fictionalised play, which was successful enough to spawn a Hollywood film version in 1960, directed by noted ""message movie"" director Stanley Kramer. There are few genres more exciting than a well-made courtroom drama, a melting-pot for sudden revelations, flaring tempers and impassioned monologues. Though perhaps lacking the sense of realism apparent in other similar pictures, such as '12 Angry Men (1957)' and 'The Verdict (1982),' Kramer's film is both an important and entertaining film, maturely approaching the roots of the Creation-Evolution debate and offering a perspective that certainly skews towards Darwinism, but is never anti-religion {in fact, the play was originally intended as a critique of Macarthyism}. The main acting performances are assuredly phenomenal, employing an impeccable selection of cinema's most seasoned performers: Spencer Tracy plays the honest and likable Henry Drummond, defending lawyer of the accused man, whose laid-back, profanity-laden demeanour in court suggests world-weariness rather than impertinence. Fredric March is the celebrated religious advocate Matthew Harrison Brady, whose sterling reputation earns him a rousing welcome to the small town, but has his success swung the worship from the Lord to himself?The biggest surprise of the film comes from Gene Kelly, who completely abandons all notions of being a musical performer. As controversial journalist E. K. Hornbeck, Kelly is hilariously smug and sarcastic, regularly uttering succinct and scathing witticisms that often leave his subjects shocked and offended. Though he's undoubtedly not a very nice person to know, and admits to having a lonely existence, his eventual response to Drummond's accusations proves one of the film's more memorable lines: ""You'll be there. You're the type. Who else would defend my right to be lonely?"" The superb, multi-faceted characterisations of each of the main characters is ultimately what makes 'Inherit the Wind' so admirable, with both Drummond and Brady revealing truths about themselves that we never would have expected. An interesting dimension to Tracy's character is that he is revealed to be a quietly-religious man, placing his faith in both the Holy Bible and the teachings of science. After all, Drummond isn't at all refuting the validity of religion in a person's life, but is merely arguing that every man has the right to think for himself, to strive to understand the glorious world that he inhabits, whether he believes God to have created it or not."
"As a boy of 12 or so, sick and home from school for about a week, I had the pleasure to discover Inherit the Wind on NYC's ""Million Dollar Movie"". By week's end I had much of Drummond's dialogue memorized. Last nite, nearly 40 years later, I got to revisit this classic on TCM (without commercial interruption). Most of the scenes were unfamiliar to me except for Tracy's cross-exam of March. Gene Kelly as HL Menken was more sympathetic then I recall. Dick York (as Scopes) was also more important then I remembered. This movie is a must for anyone interested in the underlying debate, or fearful of a zealous majority that knows they are right. Nice to watch March in Elmore Leonard's Hombre with Paul Newman after seeing his performance as Bryan here. That's evolution. :-)"
"How often do you see a film that truly does have a gripping basic premise, an excellent script, superb performances and memorable atmospheric direction? I think I've only seen one film that ticks a 10 in all four of these boxes - and this is it.The plot is straightforward enough: two famous charismatic lawyers come to small town America to fight it out in court over the question of God vs. Science. The fact that this actually happened makes it even more compelling. The script zips along, is absolutely hilarious in parts and deeply moving and inspirational at others. You feel, meanwhile, that you are sweltering in the intense heat of the Deep South, as the sweat-stained shirts and huge fans captivate you in the same cloying atmosphere as the players.Which brings me to the best single thing about this movie: How to describe Tracy and March. They personify a time when great actors didn't have to look like Gods, but just had to act like people. These two extraordinary characters collide in explosive but authentic verbal jousting, and there are some magnificent speeches - particularly from Tracy's character, in defence of individual mind and thought.But what truly marks their playing out as special is the way they bring out the fact that these two great protagonists are in fact great friends who have known each other all their lives. The best scene in the film, for me, is that after a day of intense fighting in court, when they meet outside their hotel late at night and enjoy a friendly old-time reminiscence on the porch. There is no sense of hypocrisy in them getting along, just a genuine portrayal of respect and affection between two old rivals despite their profound disagreements on the issue. You wouldn't get that in films today - and if you did, it would not be played so authentically well.March in particular manages to present his character, though a staunch and harshly intolerant man, as extremely sympathetic and motivated by a true desire to do what he believes is in people's best interests. His character should be a villain. But by the end of the film we see him as a good man who was merely misguided.I can't recommend this film too highly. It is brilliant. The two leads are well supported by an excellent cast - so avoid the well-meaning re-makes and make sure you see this one. For those of us who love movies, the question, ""what is your favourite film of all?"" is never an easy one to answer. But I think, on balance, this is mine. See it."
"I wrote that famous saying because, if you have respect for history, you know about how in 1925, one biology teacher, John T. Scopes, was arrested and tried in Dayton, Tennessee for teaching the theory of evolution to his high school students in a state where the act was illegal (Scopes, for accurate history's sake, volunteered to challenge the law on a bet). Nowadays, creationism, the belief that God created life, is being decorated as ""intelligence design"" by fundamental Christians who want the idea taught in public schools. Though a judicial defeat came in Dover, Pennsylvania, the idea hasn't lost steam. Just look at the public school system in the state of Kansas. Yeech!!!!Anyway, ""Inherit The Wind"" is a fictional account of the ""Monkey Trial"" Scopes endured, written by Joseph Lawrence and Robert E. Lee as a play. Socially conscious filmmaker Stanley Kramer (""Judgment At Nuremberg"", ""Guess Who's Coming To Dinner?"") took the play to the silver screen and the conclusion is smart, quart-amount funny and proves that having an opinion different from the status quo doesn't (and shouldn't) mean a person should suffer the wrath of judicial condemnation (Hear that, you McCarthies and Asscrofties!).Bertram T. Cates (a gaunt, brave Dick York) replaces Scopes as the accused in the town of Hillsboro, ""the buckle of the Bible belt"". His fiancée, Rachel Brown (Donna Anderson) wants to him to admit his guilt and apologize, so their marriage could be a holy union in the eyes of the town's citizens, particularly her preacher father. Cates stands firm, even though high-confidence biblical lawyer and three-times Presidential candidate Matthew Harrison Brady (a spirited Frederic March, whose character swaps with William Jennings Bryant) has volunteered to assist the prosecution. Brady sees ""God's on trial"", but he didn't count on an old friend, civil rights attorney Henry Drummond (an aging yet scrappy Spencer Tracy), a trade for Clarence Darrow, to defend Cates.""Wind"" is an unusual but heated boxing match. Pro and con opinion holders are boxers meeting in the ring, facing each other and sizing each other up. Onlookers are referees. Nobody throws fists, only words, and thanks must given to Ernest Laszlo, the genius behind the film's cinematography. Two-time Oscar holders Tracy (nominated for this acting gig) and March defend the opposing beliefs as ""colonels"", deemed by judicial power. And when they argue, they argue! Critics have deemed famed song-and-dance man Gene Kelly (""On The Town"", ""Singing In The Rain"") miscast for the role of E.K. Hornbeck, the faux version of holy ideal-scoffing newsman, H.L. Mencken, who delightfully demeans Brady, his supporters and their belief in God, but the performance is eye-wink ironic. Kelly pokes righteous fun at the ""moral people"" who have enjoyed his usual musical performances yet have bigoted views against people and ideas different from themselves. However, Kelly's Hornbeck learns he's no different from them in his championing of Cates.A sharp cast occupies the film, littered with future TV players. York is best known as the first Darrin Stevens of the sitcom ""Bewitched""; Claude Atkins (""B.J. And the Bear) is a vehement sour puss as the Reverend Jeremiah Brown; Brady cheerleader Jesse H. Dunlap is played by Ray Teal, of the western drama, ""Bonanza""; Harry Morgan (the late 1960s TV version of ""Dragnet"", M.A.S.H.: The Sitcom) is the no-nonsense judge; a simple farmer is played by Noah Berry Jr. of the detective drama, ""The Rockford Files"", and Norman Fell (""Three's Company"") has a funny, little part as a radio technician.Two interesting notes: Florence Eldridge, March's real-life wife, plays Brady's wife, Sarah, who shows not everyone on her husband's side is fanatical, and her husband's is ""just a man"". Also, the film's co-writer, Nedrick Young, had to use the pseudonym, Nathan E. Douglas, in order to be credited with fellow scribe Harold Jacob Smith on the film, let alone work in Hollywood, despite his then-blacklisted status for having Communist ties. How real life and fantasy can intertwine The 1988 TV remake is a wooden penny, with Jason Robards and Kirk Douglas miscast as Drummond and Brady. The producers probably wanted ""a theatrical play"" to the film, but a play and a film are two different animals. However, Darren McGavin of the pre-""X Files"", sci-fi/horror/fantasy drama, ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"" is more than suitable as Hornbeck, since he played an outlaw newsman on TV, and gives the snail-like story some sparks. Superiority is present in the 1999 version with Jack Lemmon as Drummond (he won an Golden Globe), George C. Scott as Brady, Piper Laurie as Sarah, a crackerjack tongued Beau Bridges (his and his brother Jeff's dad, Lloyd Bridges, was also blacklisted) as Hornbeck, Tom Everett Scott as Cates and a pretty, pre-""Cold Case"" Kathryn Morris as Rachel. I hope Sony/MGM will release the better version on DVD soon.""Wind"", as the play, the 1960 and the 1999 film versions, should be mandatory material in high school because the story's lesson is the right to think, no matter how agnostic or religious you are, is a holy gift."
