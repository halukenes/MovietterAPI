"I find it difficult to believe that some reviewers' negative reactions to this film are based on their (misguided) beliefs that none of this could possibly have happened. Comments like these make it crystal clear that what some people don't know about history is appalling. If you are going to judge a film based on historical fact, it helps if you know what it is.
It is well-documented what amazing technical feats the POW's were able to accomplish in the stalags. There was even an entire section of the British Secret Service dedicated to coming up with all sorts of clever ways to send these captured men the tools they needed to facilitate their escape attempts, i.e., sandwiching maps between the split sides of a record album (yes, the Germans allowed the prisoners to have records in the camps) or compasses in pens. At Colditz Castle, one of the more forbidding stalags, (actually an offlag since is was for officers only), many, many tunnels were dug and disguises created. One man actually created a German sergeant's uniform totally from scratch, donned a moustache and created an overall impersonation so realistic, it fooled two out of three sets of sentries. Some of the POW's built and concealed an entire glider that would have carried two men off the roof and over the wall! The only reason it didn't fly was because the prison was liberated before they got the chance! The Colditz experience is well documented. There are many books written about that particular prison complete with photographs, including one by a German officer confirming these amazing escapes and attempts. The reviewers who doubt what can be done when necessity is truly the mother of invention should look for them and learn something. As for the prisoners not being in jumpsuits, as suggested by one reviewer as one reason to question the authenticity of the film? Ludicrous, POW's wore what they were captured in. The German military (different from the Gestapo and the SS) considered them soldiers and allowed them to keep their badges of rank.As for the film itself, it is long, but absorbing. There are historical flaws (as there are in all movies), but several of the former POW's participated in the filming process, keeping it, for the most part,  very authentic. As for the emphasis on Americans, it's true they were not among the escapees per se, but several did assist in the effort before they were transferred out, as mentioned by a previous reviewer. However, you must remember that the movie was made for an American audience in 1963, long before international distribution revenue became so important to a studio's bottom line. They needed American stars who would appeal to an American audience. Who knows, perhaps if they were to remake it today, the cast would be all British and German, but I doubt it (see ""Hart's War"" where not only the plot, but all the British and Canadian characters that were in the book, disappeared).All in all, ""The Great Escape"" is an entertaining movie telling a fascinating story of what ordinary men can achieve in adverse circumstances. It's well worth the time."
"This is a great movie which much more historically accurate than it is often given credit for. So many who say otherwise are ill-informed and obviously don't know much about the actual history of that actual escape. The depiction of what happened to the recaptured prisoners in the movie of THE GREAT ESCAPE is reasonably accurate as detailed on the historyinfilm site...specifically on the ""Reprisal"" page; along with being detailed in the various published accounts.Hitler ultimately calmed down after being reasoned with by Goering, Feldmarschall Keitel, Maj-Gen Graevenitz and Maj-Gen Westhoff, and dictated that more than half the prisoners be shot and cremated. So, as depicted in the film, several of those recaptured were not executed and were indeed returned to confinement. In fact, even those executed were not ""shot on the spot"" for the most part, but were actually executed later after being turned over to the Gestapo; most being shot while being allowed to relieve themselves, under the guise of ""trying to escape"".Furthermore, there are many accounts as to how much more humane the environment was within the camp (which even had a popular and very successful theatre, featuring prisoners who would later be name performers) than many other POW camps...and certainly nothing like the harsh conditions associated with the Concentration or Extermination camps.To quote one source:""It must be made clear that the German Luftwaffe [the German Air Force], who were responsible for Air Force prisoners of war, maintained a degree of professional respect for fellow flyers, and the general attitude of the camp security officers and guards should not be confused with the SS or Gestapo. The Luftwaffe treated the POWs well, despite an erratic and inconsistent supply of food.Prisoners were handled quite fairly within the Geneva Convention, and the Kommandant, Oberst (Colonel) Friedrich-Wilhelm von Lindeiner-Wildau, was a professional and honourable soldier who won the respect of the senior prisoners.""Finally, virtually all the major engineering aspects in regards to the tunnels and the initial escape in the film are as they were actually acheived in the real escape.It would behoove some to learn a little more actual history or do a little simple research before shooting from the hip with supposed ""knowledge"" of reality. THE GREAT ESCAPE certainly takes liberties in tone and character portrayal, but not in the key elements that are disparaged out of sneering ignorance.BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI is also a great film, but took even greater liberties with the technical details of the events described than THE GREAT ESCAPE did....and offering up VON RYAN'S EXPRESS as a more realistic alternative is simply delusional and ridiculous."
"During World War Two the Germans build a new prison camp, Stalag Luft III, for the express purpose of housing many of their most troublesome captured Allied airmen. However, all this serves to do is to pool the resources of some of the most ingenious escape artists in captivity and fill them with a resolve to engineer a mass breakout from the camp.   Based largely on real events, this film has assumed classic status over the years and its easy to understand why. Quite simply, it excells in many departments. Director John Sturges was at the height of his creative powers and he keeps a firm grip on the proceedings. Although the film runs close to three hours it never feels sluggish, while at the same time winding up the tension gradually and developing the characters. The production design is first rate, to the point where Donald Pleasance (who had been a P.O.W.) felt quite intimidated by the vast set on his arrival. Daniel Fapp's beautiful photography shows this and the picturesque German locations off to full effect. Put these virtues together with a good script, inspired casting and a classic score by Elmer Bernstein, and you have an object lesson in how to create an intelligent and exciting big budget adventure film.   On the subject of the cast; Much is made of Steve McQueen's role. While I am a huge McQueen fan, I feel that some of the other performances are equal to, if not better than his. Richard Attenborough, James Garner, Donald Pleasance, Charles Bronson and Gordon Jackson are all excellent. Good too are James Coburn, James Donald, David McCallum and Hannes Messemer as the sympathetic Commandant.   This is one of those films that I can happily watch time and time again. In September of this year a new print was screened at the NFT in London as part of an 'Attenborough at 80' season. It was a pleasure to see this on the big screen at last. For the most part the print was in very good condition. The DVD was one of the first that I ever bought some three and a half years ago, and I watched its inevitable Christmas screening on BBC2 last night. I just never tire of it. In these days of brainless, poorly executed action fodder, its a joy to behold something that hits its targets so precisely."
"This must be my favorite movie of all times. Having seen it for the first time,in I guess 1987,a BBC Christmas broadcast,I was captivated by this brilliant piece of work. In the years after,I probably have seen it a ""million"" times,owning it on VHS and DVD,and still watching,whenever it is broadcast,in the original language. Why is it so great? This is a movie that keeps you locked to the screen,because it has everything a great movie should have. A great story,a good length,tension,it is a WW2 movie and the actors give top performances.Not just Steve McQueen,although his performance is brilliant,but also James Garner,James Coburn,Richard Attenborough,Charles Bronson and in this film,one of the greatest roles Donald Pleasance,playing the forger. It isn't historically accurate,please read the book by Paul Brickhill,but that doesn't matter a bit. This film gives you an image of POW camp,the prisoners and their guards,the Germans are also played brilliantly by German actors. I will not repeat the story here,but I can tell you,this film will capture you,all the characters are portrayed brilliantly by the actors. There is excitement,humor,tension,drama and emotion. See it,you will not regret it."
"'The Great Escape' had the advantage of a fine source, and a fine script... Each actor realizes his potential in a very detailed manner, giving a feeling lost in the actual cinema...Sturges is careful with the pace in the first half, allowing the escape plans develop slowly... Humor, excitement and human drama are wonderfully blended, and smartly underscored by Elmer Bernstein's memorable background music... The film opens with several truckloads of Allied officers, mostly pilots, being transferred to a new German maximum-security prison camp at Sagan... The Camp 'Kommandant', Von Luger (Hannes Messemer), tells Captain Ramsey (James Donald), 'We have, in effect, put all our rotten eggs in one basket, and we intend to watch this basket carefully.'But since all the British and American officers in his charge are men who have made several attempts to escape from other prison camps, Von Luger knows his words are meaningless... The master planner is 'Big X,' Roger Bartlett (Richard Attenborough), who has just endured three months of Gestapo/SS torture, and plans to strike back, getting as many men as possible out of the camp, in order to 'harass, confuse and confound the enemy' behind the lines...He announces a terrific plan for a mass break-out of 250 men and schemes three simultaneous tunnels Tom, Dick, and Harry... The plan, so precise, proceeds in an orderly fashion, with a great deal of attention placed on caution and ruse to deflect German attentions... The captives involve themselves in much surface activity, which masks the underground work... Hilts (Steve McQuenn), the 'Cooler King,' leads the Germans on a memorable motorcycle chase through back roads and across the fields right up to the Swiss frontier...Hendley (James Garner), the 'Scrounger' is a charming thief whose particular gift is the misappropriation of all the required supplies for an escape...Blythe (Donald Pleasance) has the talents of a 'Forger', and makes visas and passports... He suggests in one scene: ' Tea without milk is so uncivilized.'Danny Velinski (Charles Bronson) is the experienced Polish-American 'Tunnel-King.' Louis Sedgwick (James Coburn) is the 'Manufacturer' of bellows-operated ventilation...Ashley-Pitt (David McCallum) is the 'Dispersal' with his ingenious methods of getting rid of the dirt generated by the tunneling activities... Andy McDonald (Gordon Jackson ) is 'Intelligence,' the officer who develops a fantastic security system to protect the compounds from the German ""Ferrets."" Archibald Ives (Angus Lennie) is the 'Mole,' whose fragile mind has been taxed by several years in the camps, repeated failed escape attempts, and time in the cooler...Dennis Cavendish (Nigel Stock) is the 'Surveyor' who miscalculates the distance to the trees...Guard Werner (Robert Graf) is the 'Ferret' who affirms to Hendley: 'I could tell you stories about my teeth that would make your hair stand on end.' 'The Great Escape' is a pretty good motion picture where the toll of freedom is precious, and the movie's ending provokes deep and serious meditation... It graphically shows what enterprising men can accomplish under the most unusual circumstances... It has a great cast, and is beautifully made..."
"Credit should be given to the brilliant score by Elmer Bernstein. If you listen to it closely, it literally is a battle between the Allied Prisoners (flutes & woodwinds) and the Germans (tubas).  The escape scenes with the little boat on the scenic german river is evocative of Wagner and his heroic Germanic Operas.  The scenery of the German countryside and the Alps is breathtaking.  I believe that the scriptwriters emphasized the heroism, humor, and character of the prisoners to make an uplifting statement of what is essentially a cruel and tragic story.  As a child growing up in the seventies, our 7th grade glass was reading the Paul Brickhill book and we had the opportunity to meet a former (American) Stalag Luft III prisoner from that era.  He had arrived at the camp after the Great Escape, but was placed on the monument detail for the 50 executed men. He said that few men seriously contemplated escape after this incident and the emphasis was on surviving the war and going home alive."
"The Great Escape is a classic war movie with plenty happening in it. It just so happens that it is my all time favourite having seen it 60 times since it first was released. Steve McQueen , as Hilts, was the driving force behind this movie. He seemed to tie everything together between the American and British prisoners especially in the scene where they were celebrating the 4th of July with the drums and good ole fashioned American moonshine. The Great Escape contains one of the most famous movie scenes of all times when McQueen has half of the German army chasing after him while riding his motorcycle trying to jump the barb wire fence to get to Switzerland. All in all, The Great Escape had a cast of actors that was so strong that it was a wonder they got this movie made in the first place with all of the egos involved. James Garner, Charles Bronson, Angus Lennie, James Coburn, etc.were absolutely awesome."
"The Great Escape tells the amazing story of a whole bunch of allied prisoners who accomplish a mass breakout during World War II, some of whom actually did make it to freedom and the allied armed forces once again. The film is so good that you do not mind the fact that some American players were tossed into the story as the real story was one accomplished by the British.To insure that the American movie public would be buying tickets, several American players got into The Great Escape. Charles Bronson, James Coburn, and a pair of American TV cowboys just breaking into big screen star status, James Garner and Steve McQueen were put in the film. Director John Sturges had worked with McQueen, Coburn, and Bronson in his last film The Magnificent Seven. Sturges does a grand job in never letting his audiences attention flag for one minute in this almost three hour length film.What the Nazis have done in this film is to build a brand new prison camp and have put all the perennial escape artists in this one. Of course by doing so a whole lot of talented escape artists in one place.And the organized effort is led by Richard Attenborough. Without going overboard into a whole lot of flag waving, Sturges and Attenborough give us the portrayal of a deeply patriotic man who if he can't back into the fight himself, is going to do what he can from a POW camp to bedevil the people making war on his country. He leads the mass escape attempt with an almost corporate efficiency.The opposite of course is Steve McQueen. I've always thought of Captain Virgil Hills as the ultimate Steve McQueen role of individualism. He and flight officer Angus Lennie are going to get out, no matter what, on their own or with the group. Angus Lennie is the former jockey now RAF flight officer and his death amidst a Fourth of July party that McQueen, Garner, and Jud Taylor have is one of the most moving scenes ever put on film. McQueen decides to play for the team after that.The Great Escape allowed McQueen to indulge in one of his hobbies of motorcycling. His race through the German country side on a stolen Nazi uniform and motorcycle is a spectacular one, aided and abetted by Elmer Bernstein's magnificent film score.James Garner bonds with Donald Pleasance in the film. Garner is an American in the RAF Eagle Squadron, Americans who couldn't wait for their own country to get into the war who enlisted in the RAF. A lot of Garner's TV character of Bret Maverick is in his role as Hendley the scrounger/con artist. Pleasance is his room mate, the shy bird watcher who does the work of forging documents for the escaping prisoners. He's going blind as it turns out, my guess would be from untreated glaucoma. It's nice to see Donald Pleasance for once as a nice guy on the screen. His death due in part to his incipient blindness is also a moving one.Charles Bronson is also another foreign volunteer for the RAF, from Poland as befitting Bronson who is of Polish origin. He's the tunnel digger who suffers from claustrophobia and his scenes are primarily with British teen idol John Leyton. This was another of a long series of great character roles for Bronson on his way to stardom.James Coburn shows that like Robert Mitchum, he too had a good ear for accents. His Aussie speech pattern is as good as Mitchum's was in The Sundowners.The Germans here are also portrayed three dimensionally. Robert Graf is the not too bright corporal who isn't exactly happy to be at war, but is grateful he ain't serving in Russia. He gets unmercifully conned by Garner. Hannes Messemer is the commandant of the POW camp, an officer in the Luftwaffe. The prisoners are nearly all RAF officers and enlisted men and the Luftwaffe is in charge of the camp. Messemer is as fearful of the S.S. and the Gestapo as his prisoners are. He's also as very conscious of the atrocities those worthy organizations are capable of and my favorite scene in the film is him having to tell of one to the Senior British officer in the camp, James Donald. Messemer is conscious also of his failure to watch the basket of rotten eggs put in his charge very closely.The Great Escape does the one essential thing for a movie to do, it moves. Even in just the scenes of planning and preparation you are aware of movement. I mentioned Elmer Bernstein's film score. It's one of Bernstein's best, maybe one of the best known of any film in cinema history. The Great Escape is one of those films you can watch dozens of times and never tire of. It's a wonderful film, a real tribute to the best in mankind under some of the worst circumstances."
"The Great Escape is THE prison escape movie. The film is rich with characters and the direction by John Sturges is great. Steve McQueen is the man and the rest of the cast are terrific. This movie is heroic and shows the bravery of men in the second world war. I escape into this movie whenever I feel really down, it's a great spirit lifter and one of the greatest films of all time."
"""Wait a minute, you aren't seriously suggesting that if I get thru the wire and case everything out there, and don't get picked up, to turn myself in and get thrown in the cooler for a couple of months so you can get the information you need""Smart, witty and directed with adroit hands by John Sturges, The Great Escape is standing the test of time as a joyous multi cast family favourite. Based on the real accounts of allied soldiers escaping en mass from a German POW camp back in 1942, the film is involving from start to finish, due in the main to the wonderful array of characters on show. We follow them from the moment they arrive at the camp right through to the stunning climax, and it is with great joy I say that none of the cast lets the side down, they all do great work for the astute and undervalued Sturges. A number of great set pieces align with Elmer Bernstein's fabulous score to never let the blood settle, and in among the cheeky slices of humour is palpable tension to make this simply one of the best films of its type, in fact one of the best films ever.Sturges and his writers, James Clavell & W.R. Burnett, adapt from the book written by Paul Brickhill, someone who speaks from experience having been one of the prisoners of super POW camp Stalag Luft III, which of course is what The Great Escape is born from. Sturges was fascinated by the story and after trying without fail for over a decade to get it onto the screen, he finally succeeded. The success three years earlier of his star ensemble Western, The Magnificent Seven, enabled Sturges to realise his vision, the result of which is still enthralling new generations with each passing year.The cast is made up of notable thespians and iconic heroes. Steve McQueen (enticing the American audience in one feels), Richard Attenborough, Charles Bronson, James Donald, Donald Pleasance, James Coburn, James Garner, David McCallum, John Leyton and Gordon Jackson. Which of course is a pretty tidy roll call, but the input and impact of Hannes Messemer as the Camp Commandant, Colonel Von Luger should not be understated. His scenes have a real humanistic quality that shows a softer side of Germany to the one ruled by a certain despot (the finale here offering up the counter opposite of the war), the writers smartly, and rightly, not tarring a nation with the same old brush.A wonderful involving movie that puts characteristic heart in bed with the action and suspense laden plot. 10/10"
"This film does take a few libertys with facts, there were no Americans involved in the escape, though some helped plan it, and where transferred to another camp at the last moment.This film though is about heroes and the spirit of freedom.T he film belongs to McQueen who is just fantastic to watch the camera loved him and I believe one day he will jump that fence.The rest of the cast are particurlarly good, the scene where the forger is told he can't escape is moving especially when James Garner volunteers to look after him.The James Garner character is roll model for me I  always try to scrounge things.Simply watch and enjoy a truly great movie you will laugh and then feel down. I give this movie 8/10"
"I saw this movie for the first time as a nine year old boy on a big screen in the Bronx.  I'm now in my 40's.  I have seen it many times since but not on the big screen. It was meant for the big screen!  It's on my top five list along with The Sand Pebbles. It's a great movie about hope and freedom and man's responsibility to his fellow man.  These men are all near saints; James Garner insisting on Donald Plesence making the escape, Charles Bronson fighting his claustrophobia. Steve McQueen is the star among the stars, not merely because of his motorcycle skills but for  his attempt to save a life and for bringing  the game of ""off the wall"" to the masses.  :-)"
"There are only two things wrong with The Great Escape:(1) There was no sequel.(2) I have never figured out how to get my A-2 flight jacket to look as beat up as the one worn by Virgil Hilts.McQueen personifies the American Air Force officer in WW2.  He is a strong individualist, put off by Mickey Mouse discipline but has put up with it in order to fly. Yet when faced with a political and moral challenge- escaping from a POW camp, or harassing the enemy, both to maintain his dignity and continue the fight, he shows an inner discipline and strong team player mentality.McQueen's own military experience shows though here and gives real depth and credibility to his character (despite his arrogance, Hilts addresses the German Commandant by ending each response with ""Ya Voll, Herr Oberst"" [Yes sir, My colonel]. As he passes the Senior British Officer [SBO] in the last scene, he nods and acknowledges his superior officer with a simple ""...sir"").  These are traits of an experienced soldier, not an actor reading lines.  McQueen plays his role this way throughout the movie.Like every other McQueen fan, I keep watching the film again and again, because I know if I do he will eventually jump the motorcycle over the barbed wire fence and head off to freedom.(Note:  The character Hilts was based upon was an OSS agent named Sage. Sage eventually did escape from another POW camp later in the war, so even though the bike jump wasn't successful, Hilts was. Somewhat of a consolation).A beautiful Elmer Bernstein sound track is hauntingly choreographed with stunning German Bavarian scenery.  John Sturges has assembled his cast of ""usual suspects"": McQueen, Coburn & Bronson from previous war and western flicks. Sir Richard Attenborough is superb as ""Big X"" the escape committee mastermind, and James Garner plays James Garner plays James Garner...as (Bret Maverick) the perennial wise cracking thief and scrounger.Even after nearly 40 years, I still love watching the intro credits roll and the music start...Once the POWs jump down from the trucks I'm absorbed into the plot all over again."
"The Great Escape should be a movie every one has seen.  It's the definitive P.O.W. movie -- and all other films in the genre fail to compare.  It should be noted that this isn't just a Steve McQueen movie (although he is bound to be everyone's favorite character), but this is an ensemble piece with great performances by Richard Attenborough, James Garner, James Coburn, Donald Pleasence, and Charles Bronson.  Wonderful build-up, great middle, and a terrific ending.  This film is classic.  One of the best scores of all time."
"POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!Exciting, funny, tragic, with a massive cast who all perform brilliantly, providing many memorable moments, The Great Escape as everyone knows tells the story of the attempted escape of allied troops from German imprisonment. The characters are all well drawn, both Allies and Nazis, and each has a distinct personality, though McQueen's stands out. Even though only a few escape this is still a story of hope to rival The Shawshank Redemption. Memorable scenes are obvious: Steve's biking, Pleasance's tragic end, the celebrations which end in death, the 'get out and stretch your legs' scene, and the train station scene. With beautiful cinematography and a rousing score, this is a favourite for many people-it's shown here every Christmas. Interesting in that this is one of the few films i can think of which has no female character of note. 9 out of 10"
"I imagine it was the lengthy running time that kept me for so many years from seeing The Great Escape, although that doesn't explain why I haven't seen hordes of other movies. But I've been going back and watching all the old classics and The Great Escape is one of the best ones I've seen so far. The movie is not only wildly entertaining throughout it's nearly three hour duration, but shows some actors who went on to become famous for other roles in decades and generations to come. Granted, I am speaking from the perspective of a different generation of moviegoers, which is why I know Charles Bronson more from Death Wish than this film, or James Coburn from films like Payback and Affliction, Donald Pleasance as Dr. Sam Loomis and Richard Attenborough as John Hammond from the Jurassic Park films.I think the thing I loved the most about the movie was how open everyone was about their plans to escape. Not that they tried to escape out in the open, but they made no effort to hide the fact that they were analyzing their surroundings, trying to find a way to get out. As we soon learn, it is their sworn duty as captured officers to consistently try to escape and, failing that, to make life as confusing and frustrating as humanly possible for their captors. The story involves a lot of British officers being held captive by the Germans, at a prison where all of the most consistent escapers have been compiled for special supervision. When the prisoners arrive at the beginning of the movie, many of them, including Virgil Hilts (Steve McQueen) walk into the gates and then immediately walk to the fences around the outsides of the compound, looking up and down the length of the fences, studying where the guard towers are, looking in broad daylight for ways to escape.What follows is a brilliant competition between the proud British officers being held captive and the Germans guarding them, as the British make every attempt to escape and receive minimal punishment when they're caught. 20 days in the cooler for a failed escape attempt (doubled from only 10 for mouthing off) is pretty light compared to what I would have expected POWs to have suffered at the hands of the Nazis in World War II.Because the escapes are only hidden during their preparations, there are portions of The Great Escape that play almost like a sports movie more than a war film, because of the atmosphere of competition and, among other things, there is so much comic relief, One of my favorite scenes is the one where they first begin digging under the floor in their bunker. Danny Velinski (Bronson) is under the floor digging away when the Germans march in for a surprise inspection, and he jumps out, they put the cover back on the hole and smear clay around it and then pour water into it, one guy starts mopping the floor, everyone else goes back to playing cards or milling about, and Velinski hops in the shower, and the suspicious officers come in and demand to know what they're each doing. The guy mopping explains that he's mopping, Velinski says he needed a wash, and Louis Sedgwick (Coburn), says about Velinski, ""I'm watching him. I'm a lifeguard!""It's also a great scene when Hilts (McQueen) tells Bartlett (Attenborough) and the other officer his plan for escape. Steve McQueen is the star of the movie but spends most of it pretty much out of the loop. He was in the cooler when the plans for the great escape were first hatched, so when he finally got out most of the camp was involved in planning this epic breakout, and Hilts comes up to Bartlett and one other officer and gleefully tells them about his and Ives' nutty plan to burrow three feet down and dig straight out, sticking metal tubes through the ground to the surface so they can breathe. Bartlett and the other officer leave both of them out of the plans for the time being, for reasons that are explained later in the film.The movie is expertly written, with outstanding dialogue and even better performances and direction that I like to think is still inspiring filmmakers throughout the world. I learned from another reviewer on the IMDb that the music is almost competing within itself, with different instruments representing the British and the Germans, so I was watching for it when I watched the movie. Not only is the different music representative of the two opposing sides, but it does it within scenes and even within individual shots. Consider, for example, the scene where Hilts and Ives are first brought into the cooler. The music is almost reacting to what is going on on screen, like it's trying to describe where each character is within the frame. That is true film-making brilliance. The movie ends with a massive setback, a tremendous downturn in tone, but does so without turning into a tragedy or overshadowing everything else that has gone on before that and, most importantly, while remaining true to the real life story. It displays the pride and determination of British military as well as was done in The Bridge on the River Kwai, and that is a major accomplishment. Bravo."
"Sometimes a big, cynical package entertainment off the generic production line transcends its origins and goes into orbit, as it were, growing ever larger in memory. ""Casablanca"" was the classic example; ""The Poseidon Adventure"" and ""The Towering Inferno"" are more recent ones. For Brits, ""The Great Escape"" has this status: even as I write, soccer fans at the World Cup are beating out Elmer Bernstein's brisk march theme while England labours to a draw.Not a great hit when released, ""The Great Escape"" clicked through repeated TV showings. It goes on clicking, like ""Casablanca"" or ""Gone with the Wind""- because it embodies truth to the spirit of its own times as well as to what was 20 years in the past when it was filmed. As several reviewers have said, it doesn't wear out, and this is why.By 1963 audiences were becoming bored with endless relivings of heroic World War Two exploits: adolescent moviegoers were too young to remember it and were tired of seeing their dads' doings, which made their own lives feel smaller and duller. But ""The Great Escape"" depicted a failed breakout from an inglorious captivity; less sharp than Wilder's ""Stalag 17"", it nonetheless managed to combine the expected  set pieces of tension and derring-do with an incipient Swinging Sixties individualism. These guys are collaborating to dig their way out, but then they're on their own for the home run. Few make it.Nobody incarnated the new spirit more than Hilts the Cooler King, played by Steve McQueen. The film made him a solo star name above the title: he stands out amid an ensemble as he didn't, quite, in Sturges's ""Magnificent Seven"". McQueen's persona was set by ex-POW James Clavell's dialogue. He's not the boring, by-the-numbers rebel designed by hacks to make an authority figure such as a cop more palatable to a rebellious teen audience. He's an instinctive, can't-help-it individualist.McQueen is not gratuitously insubordinate towards his own superiors in the camp. Neither does he set out to provoke the Germans, who aren't hateful. Hilts can't help wanting to be beyond the barbed wire, and that makes his brand of rebelliousness less neurotic, more sympathetic to adult viewers than a crybaby, James Deanish sort would be. McQueen, then and later (eg in ""The Towering Inferno"") has the authority of the man who does not define his values solely by reaction against the consensus. As such, in ""The Great Escape"" he personifies democracy pitted against dictatorship in total war. He's voluntarily under orders for the duration, but he fights to be free again, and for ever: free to leap the wire and leave all confinement behind, far and fast. Meantime, he's self-contained, happy to play baseball against a blank wall, in no danger of going mad for want of company like a dictator's slave.McQueen's American cool counterpoints the laid-back qualities of the British. Donald, Attenborough and Pleasence are all quietly magnetic, assured presences. No scenery chewers wanted- this is war, too serious for show-offs. Lennie, the man driven mad, disposes of himself.The Anglo-American collaboration in this production is among the smoothest ever. The British movie business was turning into Hollywood, England; here was a story where no fancy plot tricks were needed to bring Limeys and Yanks together, and the Yanks were the kind we admired most: those who hadn't waited till Pearl Harbor but hastened to the anti-Nazi colours as freelances. Another reason to admire McQueen's maverick stance, and James Garner's quirkier version of it. At the same time, the overall patina is recognisably British stiff-upper-lip, like ""Albert RN"" or ""The Colditz Story"". There is little psychologising and no silly love interest; these chaps have a task to perform and they get on with it. Sturges was an admirer of  the British martial spirit like his fellow he-man, Hemingway. It shows.The script conflates incidents from several WW2 situations: a literal account of the March 1944 breakout at Sagan masterminded by Roger Bushell/Bartlett would have courted libel actions. Posters who criticise the portrayal of the camp have got it wrong. The men were in a Stalag, an officers' camp run by the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe, not the SS. They were under the Geneva Convention, inspected by the Red Cross. Prisoners were treated with the courtesy due to involuntary guests, though on their honour not to attempt escape as their duty to their own countries required. Even at Colditz, the castle where incorrigible fugitives were immured, the amenities of commissioned rank were respected.Many camp administrators were career soldiers who despised the Nazis; others had been transferred after being wounded in action, and had a fellow-feeling for enemies who had been captured. Inmates were encouraged to follow hobbies to take the itch out of their feet. The spirit was akin to that of von Stroheim's World War One schloss in ""La Grande Illusion"".The scene where a ""Hitler greeting"" has to be dragged out of Luger is true to life: many senior Wehrmacht officers forbade their subordinates to ""heil"" in the mess. The massacre after recapture was perpetrated not by soldiers but by the Gestapo at Hitler's command, over protests from Goering and Keitel. The phrase ""shot while trying to escape"" became common currency as a euphemism for murder."
"The Great Escape is the type of movie where people from different generations will have wide variation of opinions. People from the so-called ""greatest generation"" who lived through WWII and may have served in the ""war to end all wars"" like my grandfather, will probably enjoy this movie. It's good vs. evil in a world where that seemed so evident in life. Allied vs. Axis and the Nazis vs. freedom. This group of airmen will doing anything to escape the clutches of the evil Nazis who are holding them captive.However, the major problem with the movie is that the Nazis don't seem so evil, cruel or stern. There is lack of fear or even concern for the characters because this group of Nazis are wellnice and well-mannered to a fault. You feel like it is a game to everyone involved. The airmen try to escape and they are playfully sent away to the ""cooler"" with a smile and mild scolding. The next attempts result in the same punishment this time without the smile. Nobody is threatened with a firing squad or sent away to hard labor. The Nazis seem to encourage escape attempts.Having seen recent movies like Schindler's List, Max Manus and Sophie Scholl; the Nazis in these movies aren't so forgiving of war-time transgressions. It just rings false in this movie especially for someone in my generation (genX) or younger. This leads to a lack of intensity or involvement in the movie when you know the characters face little to no consequences for their actions.It doesn't completely ruin the movie because the final third of the movie has some real reasons to finally become involved in the characters because bullets actually start to fly and some characters actually have to fight the enemy. Still the action is stilted and hollow because of the lack of film making expertise and technology, so you don't feel the emotion that you should based on the fatal incidents.The Great Escape has some fun moments with good actors like a young Steve McQueen, James Garner and a less grizzled, almost gentle Charles Bronson. It was enjoyable to see them before they became really famous movie stars. However, this movie doesn't deserve the universal praise that it received from film critics and viewers. If you want to see Steve McQueen in a motorcycle chase this movie is for you. If you want to see an intense prison break during WWII—don't bother with this movie."
"""The Great Escape"" is a rousing blend of suspense, action and ultimately tragedy, bolstered by an all-star cast, terrific music and beautiful European locations. A few fellow reviewers have cited the unbelievably ""pristine"" prison conditions, but the German authorities did try to uphold the Geneva Convention for Western Allied POWs. The characters in this film left their well-run 'stalag' anyway, and many paid the ultimate price. While entertaining its viewers, ""The Great Escape"" effectively depicted the tragic consequences.-Tony"
"Spoilers herein.Films are like people in the respect that some are leaders but most followers. That's because most movies are not about life, but about previous movies. This film established not only a genre (I chose to resee it after `Chicken Run') but played a role in inventing a society. I'm of the belief that culture invents some art that in turn reinvents the culture. More about that in a minute.What's so special about this is that it places the American rebel (with his motorcycle) in mainstream American society. Before, the beatnik or `bohemian' was unamerican, nonmainstream. This film invents memories of the war for the generation after the war -- it takes an essentially British story and uses it as background to establish a new vision of the American rebel. This rebel is centrally American, heroic even. Independent of sex.There are four forces in this film. The evil Gestapo (with the majority of Germans, but the film glosses that); the two forces of the British and German Air Force stuck in a duel of gallantry from a prior generation; and then the McQueen force. All at once, we have the cockiness and independence of Brando and Dean transformed into a patriotic center, into something directed, seemingly casually, against intrinsic evil.I saw an advance screening of this in most peculiar circumstances. I was a cadet in a midwestern military academy whose commandant was the senior American officer at the POW camp during the planning of the escape. (Americans were moved shortly before, and the reason is an interesting story in itself.) We 850 mostly sons of republicans mostly hawks, all white were given a vision of necessary disturbance, of a strange patriot that we couldn't internalize. Only a couple months later JFK was murdered. The Cooler King was one key image we used with our brethren nationwide to reinvent ourselves. Check it out. This contributed to a national identity that actually lived for a while. Never plan to win, just make your own statement.Attenborough knows something about manipulating the British image for American consumption. His `Ghandi' is a masterpiece of posture. Talent. Sturges' camera is quiet, still, non-modern, so that you lose awareness that this is a film. This stance is dated -- wouldn't work today, and makes things feel as of a different era. Attenborough's camera sweeps (see his short episode -- the Indian sequence -- in `Close Encounters.') Attenborough's acting style here (indeed his role too) mirrors that. It is a fulcrum of everything, a subliminal sweep under Sturges' stillness.Check out the score by Bernstein. If you take out just a little of the march tempo, you have Williams' copy for Indiana Jones. Indy echoed the tone for a by that time narcissistic notion of rebellion: mystical forces of evil accommodated by selfish acquisition and pathetic self-deprecation -- the Reagan American. Williams intended to quote Bernstein  to make this point, I think.If you haven't seen it yet, look for the Cooler guard. His hesitation at the end is priceless, indicating that every soul is malleable. It is why the film wasn't made for eight years, bombed when it came out, but is now in the IMDB top 100."
"I've been meaning to watch ""The great escape"" for a very long time but just couldn't lay my hands on it for some reason - the fact that I've heard so much about this movie and how culturally significant it is to the world of cinema, prevented me from watching it, in fear that I wouldn't like it as much as the rest of the world. So the time has come and I did watch it.
Begins very slow and builds up for the most part for ""the great escape"" itself this is really a waste of a movie: almost non of the characters have a true indentity, a simple background story, even the main characters don't have a decent amount of dialogues - they are simply put there to dig, do the things they are ought to do. I've expected more from a high calibre actors like Steve McQueen or James Garner (whose performances are great by the way) but they all wear the same faces in the movie. The music is good though and even though it doesn't exactly fit to the plot and the place it is set at it makes it all the while a pleasant watch. With ""The great escape"" I'd say the era of so called blockbusters have began when the plot stopped playing the fiddle and the couple of big names thrown can make a difference in the pockets of those who had done the movie. Overall a good picture but nothing more and nothing in between to make it a great one."
"The Germans open their new POW camp and send the invites to every British and American escape artist out there. So while waiting for their garden to reap a harvest, they all decide to tunnel out of the place. The tunnel is discovered, but they still have two other ones they're working on so they continue on, even though there are the problems of the forger losing his sight, and one of the tunnel diggers being claustrophobic. They dig out but find themselves 30 feet short of the forest they were going to escape into and the Germans pick up their trail. 3 POW's make it out, 23 are captured and returned to the camp and the remaining 50 are executed. Based on a true story ( with some factual errors, and influenced by Jean Renoir's 1937 film, Grand Illusion ), this film moves very quickly with an adventureous pace and well acted roles, particularly Steve McQueen as the American motorcycling hotshot, Richard Attenbourough as the escape team head, and James Garner as the scrounger. Rating 10 out of 10."
"This is a splendid film about a daring breakout from inescapable Nazi concentration camp , Stalag Luft North , with all star cast and magnificently realized by John Sturges . It's partially based on facts adapted by James Clavell and W.R. Burnett from a bestselling written by Paul Brickhill . The continuous escapes have caused the Nazi staff ordered 'putting all the rotten eggs in one basket' as the prisoners are reunited into a special concentration camp . It deals with hard preparatives of a diverse group formed by rebel air officers and soldiers mounting a dangerous getaway from a barbed-wired and strongly controlled camp . The most part of the film concerns on the elaborated process of secretly digging an underground tunnel and the last one deals with spectacular breakout and effort the approx. 70 escaped prisoners throughout Germany trying to make their bid to freedom , including an impressive motorcycle pursuit in charge of iconic Steve McQueen for one of the best action sequences in years .This exciting story contains thrills, intrigue, tension, excitement galore, entertainment and lots of fun . Suspenseful WWII epic packs exceptional plethora of prestigious actors incarnating the motley group of POWs , giving good acting and support , as a sensational Steve McQueen whose character , ¨The Cooler King¨ , remains today as attractive iconography ; Charles Bronson as digging expert but suffering claustrophobia ; Donald Pleasance as professional on forge documents but blind , James Coburn as roguish Australian and of course Richard Attenborough as Air Force Squadron leader who plans the massive breakout , furthermore , James Garner as American officer , the British Gordon Jackson and David McCallum, among others . Colorful, atmospheric cinematography shot in Bavaria,Germany, by Daniel Fapp and perfectly remastered . Excellent production design and art direction with evocative sets by Fernando Carrere. Rousing and lively soundtrack , nowadays a classic score, by Elmer Bernstein . This blockbuster is followed by inferior TV sequel with Christopher Reeve, Judd Hirsch , Ian McShane and directed Jud Taylor who played to Goff in the original version . The motion picture is magnificently directed By John Sturges , author of various classic Western as ¨Escape from Fort Bravo, Gunfight at the OK Corral, The law and Jake Wade, Magnificent seven¨ and also realized another nice wartime film as ¨ The eagle has landed ¨ . Rating : Two thumbs up , essential and indispensable watching , a real must see."
"I checked this out from the library video stacks. It had Steve McQueen in it, so I figured what the heck? To my surprise this is a great movie. What a cast! Richard Attenborough, Donald Pleasence, Steve McQueen,James Coburn,James Garner, Charles Brosan and David Mccallum. Most of these guys before they got famous as well. One could spent hours creating spy and western connections between the cast. The movie builds up suspense well. You really want them to escape from that camp. Unlike most war movies, this movie actually injects some humor into it.(the moonshine scene a good example)The European scenery is beautiful. It's quite heart wrenching with the escapees get killed or sent back to camp. I'm really glad Hollywood didn't sugar coat it with a happy ending. It would have destroyed the drama. But there's two things that bother me about this movie.1. James Coburn's aussie accent. Auuggghhhh!2. They make the POW camp seem almost like summer camp.They even study birds for pete's sake. At girl scout camp we had cabins that looked almost identical to the ones in the film. In fact some of the camps I went to looked amazingly like the POW camp in this movie. Hmmmmm I wonder. Anyway they make it seem like a POW camp isn't really that horrible a place to be.Overall a few flaws, but a movie that is deserving of 'classic' status."
"Although I still like this film - and proudly own it on disc - I have to admit it was a disappointment seeing it after a long period of time had elapsed between viewings. When I saw this in the theater in 1963, I thought it was spectacular. Later, when it came out on VHS, I thought thought it was good but the longer the years go by, the slower this film gets and it doesn't have the hold on me it once did. Part of that is that movies are faster- moving nowadays.It just takes too long (two hours!) before the ""great escape"" finally takes place! I loved the last 50 minutes. That, still, was fascinating as much as it ever was, even though it's never been a happy one. It's still good stuff.The first two hours of this 172-minute movie turn out to be more of characterizations that anything else, although it details what went into making the escape from this German prison camp possible. Some of that is interesting, such as Chales Bronson's claustrophobia and Donald Pleasance's eyesight deterioration, etc.With stars like Steve McQueen, James Garner, James Coburn, Richard Attenborough, Bronson, Pleasance and James Donald you will get some characters you'll remember for a long time: especially, I found, McQueen's and Bronson's.Now that it is out on a special two-disc DVD which gives it a decent picture (there was an earlier DVD that wasn't much better than the VHS) and some features, it should climb back up the ladder on my rating of it. Regardless, this will always be considered on the best of the World War II movies."
"This movie could easily make my top 15 of all time.  From what I have read, it was QUITE realistic.  Several of the British officers that were actually there went to the site in Germany when it was filmed.  When something was wrong, they spoke up and got it fixed. (This has been on the History Channel several times.) There were almost no Americans, if any, at the time of escape.  They had been moved to another camp only a couple of weeks prior to the escape. Many of the prime characters were based on actual people, most notably Attenborough. I also read the book (about 30 years ago) in high school pm which the movie was based.  They had photos the Germans took of the tunnels. The movie was incredibly accurate. The tracks, the air pumps, lights, etc. It isn't the movie that was amazing, it was what the prisoners did. As far as how the prisoners were treated, for the most part, relatively well.  The death rate in a German POW camp was about 1-2%.  In a Japanese prison camp, about 35% of the Allied prisoners died, due to murder, torture, disease, starvation, etc.  The Luftwaffe, headed by Fatso Goering, guarded Allied airman because Goering had a weird sense of camaraderie with fellow flyers.  The Gestapo or SS are the ones who shot the 50 prisoners.  These war criminals were later faced war crimes trials. This is one hell of a movie. But find the book yourself."
"There are few adventure stories as great as this. The movie never flags - it uses its wonderfully large cast to perfect effect - everyone will have his favorite characters - the colors, the music, the sense of a wonderful adventure is just magnetic.It is interesting to think of how VERY different this movie could have been in different screenwriters and directors' hands. It is easy to imagine a very dark movie about an escape plan for 250 spoiled so that it involved only 76, and of the 76, 60 massacred and only a very few escaping - a story of frustration, of man's hopes destroyed, of the darkness of life. It would be interesting to see such a version - perhaps something like The Piano or Schindler's List.Instead somehow, the movie makes the viewer feel GREAT - vibrant, happy, enthusiastic, excited! It's remarkable that this story could be made to do this - I think much is due to the energy of a large group working with such dedication and teamwork, much is due to the wonderful music, much is due to the very attractiveness of the actors themselves.For me, there is something terribly appealing about the David McCallum character, Ashley-Pitt - his sacrifice to save the leader (and thus the entire operation), his looks, his manner. And something very touching about the Garner-Pleasance characters operating in tandem. Attenborough is himself properly subdued, authoritative, commanding - and Jackson is an excellent sidekick.I've always liked James Donald very much in everything - particularly as the conscience of The Bridge on the river Kwai - he's in the same form here.If you have heard the term, the ""Anglosphere"" in recent years, one can see a vivid illustration of it here - the Australian-American-English-Scottish team working perfectly - with the same sense of values to be pursued and preserved, the same sense of humor, dedication.This is just wonderful for anyone - but perhaps particularly for men since there aren't any women in it at all!"
"This is, in my opinion, the greatest film ever made! Made in 1963, this true story begins with the arrival of Allied P.O.W.'s to Stalag Luft III. They are told that there will be no escapes from this camp by the German officers, but they have made one mistake. They have literally, put all known escapees together 'in one basket' and they set about to do what they do best - ESCAPE! The scenes throughout the film are thrilling, especially the chase scene with Steve McQueen at the end of the film.Miss it at your peril."
"This movie is based on true story and I learned a lot from it : the camp environment, the characters, the German Luftwaffe, the plan and the effort of escaping, I love and enjoyed them all.One thing that made the movie special is : even if it is a historic movie, I was entertained for 2 hours and had fun watching it, ""hahaha"" a lot ! The comedy and thrilling ambiance are mixed smartly. The characters development are perfectly balanced considering there are a lot of key characters in it. I also enjoyed the scoring, it suits the comedic ambiance well.Overall, I got not only entertainment but also history at the same time. Definitely worth to watch !"
"Most people have never watched or even heard of this movie, but for those of you that have, lets all just sit back in silence for a few moments on how great it was.Alright now that thats done, I can review this. I only watched this very recently but even still after 55 years, it still holds up with its story and acting. The acting in this movie is fantastic. For the most part, the actors put as much emotion into the characters as possible, and it shows evident in how this film turned out. Even though it is based on real life events, it still is a masterpiece of cinema all the same. Steve McQueen's character is cocky and likable, while Richard Attenborough's character is stern and smart. Overall, this is a lovable classic of traditional storytelling."
"Based on veracious events, the movie has all elements of being a masterpiece. This could not be called to be a tedious artwork despite a gargantuan running time of almost 3 hours. Instead, the movie captures the imagination of the viewers, perhaps due to the ingenuity being shown by the director in the making of it."
"This film had a stellar cast, and most of them delivered. The score was unusually cheerful and eerie, too. A strange combination. In reality, allied POW's in German detention camps were treated with contempt and without mercy. What we have in this film, however, are a bunch of guys who act like they belong in a country club. The country club/summer camp they reside in is a fun place, except you'll get shot if they catch you climbing the fence. That's it - no mention of the terrible brutality these guys actually endured or the fact that they were given barely enough food to live on. No mention of the atrocities regularly visited upon them by their Nazi captors, including beatings, executions, and forced marches. Instead, we get gentlemanly or comical Germans who seem to actually care what the POW's think of them.James Garner's character seems to epitomize the relaxed country club type who seems to be on vacation. He never takes off his turtleneck, which, no doubt, would cause the average person to perspire and stink after awhile. Steve McQueen, as usual, was the coolest guy in the room, but why would the Nazis allow him to have a baseball and glove to keep himself amused while in solitary confinement? Why didn't they just shoot him or beat the hell out of him after he was captured? Instead, they treated him like a naughty school boy. Richard Attenborough turned in a fine performance, but in reality, the Nazis would have never allowed him to take such a leadership role among the other prisoners. They would have singled him out and broken him instead of giving him respect.The film had many powerful moments: the motorcycle chase, the fatal error on the bus, the massacre, the shooting of the fence climber....these were all extremely well done. The film ultimately failed, though, because it did a disservice to the men who actually lived through this by failing to convey the wretched conditions of a German POW camp.The film had many moments where you had to suspend reality for such banal situations. Why in the world would the Nazis have ever allowed the Americans to hold a 4th of July celebration that include a parade, a picnic, and free-flowing vodka? Why would they allow a still on the premises to make homemade vodka from potatoes? Where did the Americans find a large American flag and why were they allowed to run it up a flagpole? Where did they find the smaller 13-star flag to wave around? Wasn't it out of character for Hilts to suddenly become a master flutist, blowing out a flawless rendition of ""Yankee Doodle""? Colonel Klink would never have allowed Hogan and the boys such privileges! I'm surprised the Nazi guards didn't bake them cookies! What about when Hilts took out the planks from the bunkbeds (all of them) to use to reinforce the tunnel? The beds were now unusable, but the Germans didn't seem to notice all the guys sleeping on the floor, I guess. I could go on and on about these lapses in reality and this is why I wouldn't recommend this film for anyone over the age of 11. Add to this the 1960's film making habit of over illuminating all indoor scenes to the point where it seems like the actors need to wear sunglasses, and you have a very poor rendering of a POW camp. Was I the only one who noticed that the interactions and dialogue of these impeccably dressed and well-groomed men seemed like the goings-on in an upscale gay social club?"
"""The Great Escape"" is okay popcorn fare, a ""true-ish"" World War II movie that serves the facts of the real story of Stalag Luft III decently and serves the film's stars better. That's particularly true of one star, Steve McQueen, who had his most famous five minutes on screen cycling across Bavaria and never looked back.McQueen is Virgil Hilts, a ""hotshot pilot"" from the U.S. Army Air Force who makes for one restless POW. ""I haven't seen Berlin yet, from the ground or from the air,"" he tells the commandant of his prison camp, Col. von Lugar (Hannes Messemer). ""I plan on doing both before the war's over."" Hilts isn't the only one in the camp with big plans. The British, led by Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett (Richard Attenborough), plot a breakout involving no less than 250 inmates. ""You're crazy...You oughta be locked up,"" Hilts tells Bartlett, pretty funny given their situation.Was Bartlett's scheme really such a good idea, even if you factor out the Nazi propensity for brutal overreaction? I can't say I think it was, and maybe that's one mark I'd make against a film that pretty much celebrates the real-life episode as a majestic sacrifice rather than a glory-hound escapade that backfired horribly. The success rate certainly didn't justify the supposed benefit Bartlett speaks of, tying up a few German troops who were on garrison duty anyway and hardly shoring up the Dnieper River Line.There are other issues I have with ""The Great Escape"". At two hours, fifty-two minutes, it's way overlong, with all but the last 45 minutes concerned with prep work. A script that was famously being written on the run creates various dramatic subplots involving the many characters which come and go as abruptly as James Coburn's Aussie accent.What director John Sturges and his team do bring to ""The Great Escape"" is undeniable texture, a feeling for prison-camp life that feels real even as it plays at Sgt. Fury-style heroics. A cast who knew World War II all-too-well but were willing to pretend it was more adventure then nightmare also contribute. The one standout besides McQueen is second-billed James Garner as Hendley ""the scrounger"", whose scenes with both Donald Pleasance (as a fellow inmate, a ""forger"" going blind) and Robert Graf (as German guard Werner) account for much of the film's erratic charm. The rousing Elmer Bernstein score is instantly recognizable and hummable, and there's McQueen, in what seems the third and most significant stage of Sturges' star-making program, after ""Never So Few"" and ""The Magnificent Seven.""Hilts is a strange center of gravity for ""The Great Escape"", spending most of his time away from the action, stuck in a cooler bouncing a baseball to himself while Attenborough directs things. Attenborough is a bit stiff; one senses his heart wasn't in the role. McQueen does get more involved in the plot as it rolls along, collecting bunk slats to buttress the tunnel being dug beneath the camp. He's not as loose as he would be later on; and struggles a bit with the more comedic scenes. Whoever came up with the idea of him marching through the camp playing a fife probably was drinking too much potato vodka. But his confrontations with von Lugar, scrunching his face into a cocky grin, give the film much of the lift it has when he's not on that motorcycle.Messemer may have the film's most interesting role; a sympathetic Luftwaffe officer who pushes back when the Gestapo and SS tell him to take a firmer hand. He's a good man, even if he knows he's serving a bad cause, and his scenes with both McQueen and James Donald as the head British POW give you a sense of the emotional toll of war even when the combatants involved are decent.Many people like this film better than I do, and bless them. It's smart and entertaining; sometimes both at once. You can't help but be moved by the story behind the film, real as it was. Too bad the question of ""was it worth it"" is never satisfactorily presented, let alone answered."
"Back in 1963, a war film arrived on the silver screen which set the standard for all dramas which followed. True there were other great war films such as The War Lover and Twelve O'Clock High, but none of them became the launching point for so many of Hollywood's great screen stars. Paul Brickhill wrote the original true story upon which this film is based on. Furthermore, with Elmer Berstein's rousing musical score, this movie then becomes nothing short of genuine classic. The saga of ""The Great Escape"" is wound around the actual war time experiences of American and British Airmen, who'd been captured and sent to what the German High Command called 'An Escape proof' prisoner of War Camp. Upon seeing the assortment of Hollywood elite, one can not expect anything but great drama and action adventure from the entire cast. Steve McQueen, who plays Capt. Virgil Hilts, ""The Cooler King"" leads an all star line up which consists of James Garner as Hendley ""The Scrounger"", Richard Attenborough as Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett, James Donald as Group Capt. Ramsey ""The Senior British Officer"", Charles Bronson is memorable as Danny Velinski ""The Tunnel King"", Donald Pleasence as Blythe, James Coburn as Louis Sedgwick, David McCallum as Ashley-Pitt and Gordon Jackson as MacDonald. They are imprisoned and guarded by Germany's elite guards, commanded by Col. Von Luger (Hannes Messemer) who has been personally selected for the task. Since it's inception, this film has garnered a commanding cult following. It's status is notable as the vehicle which literally propels McQueen up into his stardom. *****"
"One of the all-time great films, ""The Great Escape"" is simply flawless and unforgettable. A legendary cast -- Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Garner and Richard Attenborough among them -- stars as a stubborn group of Second World War POWs who aren't content to wait out the end of battle. So they secretly dig a tunnel to take them beyond their prison camp's borders. Yet that's only one component of the escape plan, which also requires forged documents, civilian clothing, and tons of luck -- all of which they managed to scrounge up against incredible odds.A brilliant blend of character study, suspense and humor, ""The Great Escape"" is more than a film; it's an experience. It will have you rooting on the heroes and holding your breath. It will captivate and move you. ""The Great Escape"" represents everything that's magnificent about motion pictures. It doesn't skip a beat more than four decades after its release, and it's suitable for all ages."
"A silly, silly movie. I rented it based upon the rave reviews on this site, and only sat through until the end so I could add my own review. I love war movies, but this thing was a combination of ""Hogan's Heroes"" and ""Gilligan's Island"". I should have known by the goofy little theme song in the beginning that it was just a piece of Hollywood fluff, circa 1963. I find it truly hard to believe that others have rated it highly.My main problem with the film is that everybody and everything is a Hollywood cliche or stereotype. The camp guards spend the movie ignorantly staring into space while the escape plan magically develops before them, and the Commandant is downright sympathetic to the plight of his prisoners. And why were they trying to escape, anyways? I lost track of the number of scenes showing clean, healthy, well fed, well groomed ""prisoners"" sitting around smoking pipes in their sweaters, fer cryin' out loud! And the camp itself looked like an upscale hunting lodge during a comfortable summer. Imagine a 3 hour Nazi prison movie without one single unpleasant scene! This movie is nothing less than an insult to anyone that managed to survive a Nazi camp, and the millions that didn't.  Heck, I look worse after a good night's sleep than these ""prisoners"" did after 20 days in solitary. I always wondered where the idea came from to make a TV sit-com about a WWII German P.O.W. camp (Hogan's Heroes). After seeing this completely unbelievable waste of time I now know.  If you want a good WWII movie rent ""Patton"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"". This thing is just a bad comedy. I would give it a ""3"" out of ""10"". Maybe they should have added a laugh track."
"More or less guaranteed to be shown during holiday afternoons this is based on a true story. During WW2 the germans create a prison where they house all the most notorious escapees. It's a plan that is either ingenious, if they can keep everyone in, or stupid, if everyone escapes. As we all know from the movie it turns out to be an idea of the stupid variety.It's very interesting to watch the documentaries on the escape and discussions on whether it was worth it. The german officer that killed the escapees was following orders and was eventually executed himself after the war which is also a very interesting moral question. Should he have disobeyed the orders and been shot and did he deserve to die for obeying the orders.Anyway back to the film and it seems hard to believe that anybody could have not seen this. The Steve McQueen bike ride has gone into cinema folklore. The main purpose of the escape is to cause as much trouble as possible to the germans and thereby aide the allies. A great film, but also a sad story."
"Who hasn't been caught whistling the theme song from The Great Escape? I know I have. It's one of the many great qualities to the movie. Along with the catchy song, there is a gripping plot, a great cast, and everything put together makes for one memorable movie.Our story starts as new POW's, American and British, enter a new Nazi POW camp. The new ""campers"" include Roger Bartlett (Sir Richard Attenborough) or the ""Big X"", Bob Hendley (James Garner) ""The Scrounger"", and of course Virgil Hilts (Steve McQueen) ""The Cooler"". Along with others like Charles Bronson, James Coburn, and Donald Pleasance, a group of about 250 men are determined to escape this Nazi hell hole.An intricate system of signals and distractions keep the goons off of their backs. The plan is to tunnel out of the camp into the nearby wooded area. From their they will disguise themselves are German citizens and make their way back to their respective countries. This will require clothing, paperwork, acting, and other supplies needed to blend in and look normal to a German Officer outside of the camp.This true story of how soldier's tried to outsmart the German's is one that is fascinating and amusing. The little things like hiding supplies, the tunnels, and the immense amount of dirt is incredible and quite ingenious. Imagine trying to tunnel deep enough underground so no one knows what you're doing and keeping it undercover. Not to mention sneaking 250 people out at once. It's quite a challenge.This war drama is one of the best of it's era and genre of all time. What sets this movie apart from the rest is a riveting story added with some Hollywood magic to bring it back to life. Although some parts of the movie are stretched from the truth, it still tells a true story in an entertaining fashion.Director John Sturges does the story of the ""Great Escape"" a lot of justice, showing it to a wide variety of people. The Great Escape is timeless!"
"THE GREAT ESCAPE is the type of movie that I wud say is timeless because its subject matter is just something thats never going to die or get old. Its a golden classic. I saw this movie so many times n still doesn't get burn out. The acting and character development is outstanding and is something that is hardly seen today. The direction is top notch. Each character is extremely well-developed. The director takes extra care to make sure we understand each of their roles and motivation. One of the best ensemble casts I've ever seen. James Coburn, Charles Bronson, Steve McQueen, James Garner, James Donald, Donald Pleasence, Richard Attenborough, David McCallum, John Leyton, Gordon Jackson.... and the list goes on.  Almost 3 hours long n you can barely find a dull moment, which is fantastic, the movie is pretty fast paced all the way through. It is a well written story that holds your interest all the way through. The music score by Elmer Bernstein is among one of the greatest and most recognizable that you are ever going to hear and the cinematography from Daniel L. Fapp is equally impressive. The editing is done by Ferris Webster. The actual escape is filled with suspense, and the last hour of the movie we see them on the run, by plane, train, on foot, and in McQueens case, by motorcycle. By this time, we are rooting for each character as they all try to make it out of Germany. With Richard Attenborough as the leader and Steve McQueen as the unforgettable Cooler King. Its directed by John Sturges ( Bad Day at Black Rock, The Magnificent Seven, Joe Kidd)."
"The Great Escape is definitely one of my favorite movies. I remember seeing it at the drive-in when I was about 6. My parents always brought me a blanket so I could sleep in the back seat, but I stayed up for this one. The cast is excellent, with many memorable characters. Steve McQueen is at his peak, along with James Garner and Richard Attenborough. Based on a true story, a group of POWs from many allied nations plan a daring tunnel escape from a German camp. We see them plan, prepare, and dig the tunnels (3) as they elude detection from their captors. I have only one issue; the conditions of the camp are presented as a little too pristine, not dirty or squalid as in other POW movies like Stalag 17 or Von Ryan's Express. The prisoners here are always well fed and well groomed, with cleaned and pressed uniforms. But that can be overlooked because overall, the movie is excellent. The actual escape is filled with suspense, and the last hour of the movie we see them on the run, by plane, train, on foot, and in McQueen's case, by motorcycle. By this time, we are rooting for each character as they all try to make it out of Germany. All in all, a WW2 epic."
"This is an interesting and true story and like so many of the epics in the early 60's, has a great cast.  Probably Steve McQueen's best film work. Most viewer's will find it worth the 2 hours and 50 plus minutes you spend with the flick.  Recommended for all, I rated this an 8."
"This movie has everything.  Action, adventure, comedy, drama...  Okay, maybe not everything:  there are no women, so romance is out. I could never get tired of this film.  It's one of those movies where you don't even notice the 3 hour running time, you are so wrapped up in the adventure."
"SPOILERS In Britain today, there are films in the mainstream which are considered iconic. Often due to a sense of pride (Michael Caine in ""The Italian Job"" for example), these films remind us of our heritage. One such film is ""The Great Escape"". Containing some of the finest American and British actors of their generation, this film captured the spirit of patriotism from the Second World War and would adorn the walls of teenagers for years.In a German Prisoner Of War Camp, escape is in the minds of all the captives. Led by Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett (Sir Richard Attenborough), plans are underway to dig a tunnel through to the outside. Now the likes of Attenborough, James Garner, Charles Bronson, James Coburn and Steve McQueen will dig for their freedom.Led by McQueen and Attenborough, the cast of this film smacks of talent. There is no way to get past how good some of the performances are. Sir Attenborough in particular plays the role to perfection as a man with a mission and the lives of so many men in his hands.This film also contains one of the most famous soundtracks ever known. A tune which would be used by England Football Fans years later, it inspires patriotism the instant it begins.It's very difficult to explain what makes ""The Great Escape"" so good. Whilst overlong towards the end, it never ceases to entertain and it remains satisfying and enjoyable throughout. Despite the fact that Steve McQueen somehow manages to possess a leading headline, the film remains predominantly British, and it remains a joy to watch."
"When we first saw this movie in 1963 at Washington DC's RKO KEITH'S THEATRE, all 1,850 seats were filled and there were several hundred standees, no doubt in violation of the fire codes. I've never seen such a full movie-house. I was fully taken in by the star studded cast, the patriotic true story, the starring score by Elmer Bernstein, and the wonderful cinematography of the European landscape. I could not understand the Luke-warm reviews in Washington's four newspapers. 43 years later I can see the reviewers were right. This was a mediocre movie designed simply as a popular entertainment.Where John Sturges and James Clavel went wrong was stacking the deck so totally in favor of the American prisoners and against their German captors, the film has all the suspense of a 30 to zero ball game. While the Americans plot and execute the escape, at no time do the Germans lift a finger to prevent it. Everything goes smoothly according to plan. Anything and everything the prisoners need is simply found with no great effort amongst the prison grounds. How silly! Even when the Germans stumble upon the tunnel entrance under the stove, their only reaction is to look down the hole. No disciplinary action follows, not even yelling.In 1963, Hollywood hadn't yet learned to hate America. This was NOT a rotten revisionist history travesty such as Jerry Bruckheimer's PEARL HARBOR or Steven Spielberg's PRIVATE RYAN. The filmmaker's hearts were in the right place. But the 50 men to whom the film is dedicated truly were deserving of a good film being made in their honor. More a kid-flick than a serious drama, this picture does not deserve inclusion in the top 250 --- or 2,000."
"At first, THE GREAT ESCAPE seems like your normal 1960s war flick. However, as the picture progresses, it ends up being a heart wrenching tribute to POWS and their attempts to find freedom.  A masterful piece.Ted's Grade: A"
"This came third in Channel 4's recent 100 GREATEST WAR MOVIES poll a few months ago which did rather surprise me since I've always found it somewhat overrated but it does remain a fairly entertaining American movie Yes THE GREAT ESCAPE is an American movie and I'm glad that the IMDb classes it so . It's directed by an American , is produced and financed by an American studio and most ironic of all the theme tune that is adopted and chanted by English football fans was written by the American composer Elmer Bernstien . It may contain many British actors but notice also the likes of Garner , Bronson and Coburn playing British Commonwealth characters which is down to what's known as "" Audience identification "" ie if a movie is made with American money the Yanks want their movie to do well in America hence nearly every "" British "" movie you see has a major character played by an American actor As for the story itself everyone has seen the movie ( We in Britain get to see it almost once a year usually at Xmas ) so I won't linger on it too long except to say it comes in what can only be described as two parts . The first part centres on the build up of the escape with the movie's tongue firmly in its cheek ( Werner the stupid German , man jumps on bunk and it collapses etc ) with the prisoners on the run making up the second part of the story which is more serious in tone . Also watch out for the ironic scene early in the film where a character chastises someone for replying in English to a question in German as the escapees plan their escape with the character later on making the same mistake himself . Who says Americans have irony deficiency ?"
"THE GREAT ESCAPE is another overrated ""classic"" that somehow seems to stumble along film history on its good reputation. Very little about it is great, as the title suggests, and so one sits through 170+ minutes only partly enjoying the company of POWs in a Nazi camp. A Nazi camp however that's pretty far removed from anything I've imagined, heard or read about German Concentration Camps during WWII, as the film portrays it as quite a relaxed and sunny condition. The characters we're in it for are a bunch of guys that tods along happily enough aiming to escape, and while there are several neat moments among them, one character seems unclear; Steve McQueen's Captain Hilts, if not a weird character, certainly an annoying performance by McQueen. Through the hours of planing the escape, the jovial and cheerful mood of the film helped me get through it, and as we're headed out at the end I felt disappointed, as the supposed great climax is somehow disjointed and lackluster."
"Even conceding the fact that this POW camp was run by the Luftwaffe and not the SS this has got to be the silliest representation of a POW camp ever put to film and I include ""Hogan's Heroes"" in this statement.  At least ""Hogan's Heroes"" admitted it was a comedy.  After viewing the Germans represented in this piece of malarkey I am surprised World War II lasted 6 months.  I remember wondering when I first saw this as a teenager why the Germans would allow a person in solitary confinement to have games to play.  Now I know 39 years later; they wouldn't. Considering how heroic the actual events really were it is shame to see them made to look so cartoonish in this vehicle for Steve McQueen.  Good thing for him the German's didn't know what was being planned in all those private POW rooms available to those crazy flyboy prisoners.  I noticed on the DVD box someone called it the greatest World War II movie ever made.  If it is then I guess the WW II veterans I talked to were really embellishing how tough it was.  I am not completely panning this movie because it is fun to see some very good performers in their younger years (I gave it 5 out of 10).  However, having seen this movie in 1964 and in 2002 I can't say it has aged well at all.  I suspected it was a sanitized piece of propaganda in 1964 and am quite sure of it now."
"One thing that puzzles me about McQueen's attire in ""The Great Escape"".  How come he's the only one who doesn't wear any uniform?  And his clothing is more like the 1960s with his tight white pants and sweat shirt.  And he seemed more intent at playing a cool 1960s rebellious character than the 1940s officer he was supposed to be.  Didn't the director have any control over him at all?  Or was Steve McQueen only interested in his image?  He looked totally out of place even amongst the other Americans in the camp.  I accept the fact that as it was a Hollywood production there would be a fair number of US actors in it.  According to a recent documentary on British TV, only 3 Americans were incarcerated in the POW camp - the remainder being British,  Australians and the other Commonwealth countries, Poles, French and Dutch."
"In point of fact, the film used one of the camp's most heroic prisoners (the Tunnel King played by Charles Bronson) as an adviser. However, the truth is there was no such character/person as Capt. Hilts. Steve McQueen's character never existed. The famed motorcycle chase in the film never happened. It is true that thousands of Germans (not ""millions"", as actor Charles Coburn later told during the film's Special Features interview) were used to track down the 76 (not 79) who escaped. Also, Hitler had initially ordered the execution of 100 prisoners, including the 76 who escaped, but was talked into executing 50, instead.One of the best sites for the truth on the various Allied POW camps and what happened to the men in these camps as the Russians and American armies advanced is found at http://www.b24.net/pow/march.htm. There is video and audio mp3 files from Col. Von Lindeiner and many others from Luft III. The most gripping of all the accounts from these camps however is The Death March from Luft IV in Eastern Prussia. That can be seen at http://www.b24.net/pow/march.htm. It is one of the untold secrets of WWII."
"This movie is about a massive escape from a German prison camp. Unlike the fast paced and intriguing ""Stalag 17"", this movie is plodding, dull, and yet no more realistic. Everyone looks squeaky clean, which already makes it lack any of the realism of the Holden-Brand classic.A lot of big name stars are in this, led by the contemplative Richard Attenborough. The film tries to draw us into the lives of James Garner and Steve McQueen, but loses us terribly. Every war cliché is in this movie. And the director probably caved in to McQueen's insistence upon the use of motor vehicles, giving us another stupid, boring motorcycle chase no one cares about, except McQueen's red neck club. Even Garner has to get into the driving act by somehow getting a German plane. So much for realism. To top it off, we are treated to the usual cliché of kill the nearsighted man, Hollywood's favorite whipping post, and the subject of heinous prejudice unequaled.You really have to plod through this ordeal. You won't really care about anything or anyone, and will try to occasionally watch between around the house chores, but don't bother. It isn't worth it."
"It has come to my attention that the whole reason the escape happened was because of some very smart and resourceful Canadians. Yet there is no mention of Canadians in the movie. Why is that? No seriously, why were the Canadians not mentioned? If not for Canadians the Great Escape would not have happened. ""Tom, Dick and Harry"" were the making of some amazing Canadians and no one knows because the movie never mentioned them. I think this is appalling. Henry Birkland, Wally Floody and Tommy Thompson are heroes and great Canadians and I, among others, did not know their names until watching a documentary on the great escape. It is a shame that Canadians have been so downplayed in the role of winning the wars that have occurred in our past. I am a proud Canadian and the more I learn about the war and our role in them, the more I realize that Canadians have been largely unmentioned. We played a huge role in winning these wars and our soldiers deserve an honorable mention. To all our soldiers, I say thank you and god bless."
"The Great Escape is the best movie ever made. It's been so well put together, and i've heard that it's so close to the truth- that any closer and it would be classed as a documentary. The line up of actors who star in this movie are amazing. Firstly, Steve McQueen, who is in my opinion the finest actor to have ever walked the earth. (Just remember, any movie that stars Steve McQueen is a must see.) Although the entire cast were outstanding, Steve made the movie for me. He took a leaf out of his own past and brought it into the character (Captain Hilts), making the audience automatically feel a connection with Hilts. Richard Attenborough, James Garner, James Donald, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, Donald Pleasence, to name a few made the movie what it is-an unforgettable classic. For anybody who has not yet seen this movie- where have you been all these years. I'm only 18, the movie was made years before i was born and yet (living the world we have now) i find this 60s classic at the top of my list. Watch it, pay attention, it's amazing!"
"This is as entertaining as a POW film can be. It is primary a lighthearted film, though it does have its serious moments. The characters are all very colorful. They are not overly stereotyped since this film helped to created the stereotypes. I enjoy that facts the prisoners get to work on escape before their feet hit ground. It is the thing that prisoners must do. The actors are all very good. Steve McQueen is my favorite--not because he is the best actor, but because he is so cool. Nobody makes riding a bike into a barbed wire fence more imitable than he. James Garner is perfect as the ""Scrounger"". I like the scenes where he is working on the German soldier. I really enjoy all the scenes where we get to see the soldiers working, and all the creative ways in which they get the job done. Though this doesn't have the psychological complexity of ""Bridge on the River Kwai"", it is one of my favorite war movies."
"'The Great Escape' is a film based on a true story about Allied prisoners of war at a German camp who have a plan to tunnel an escape. Filled with great characters who each play a part in the scheme, great music, and plenty of adventure, this film gets the adrenaline rising. It's a thoroughly good film, and I highly recommend that everyone see it at least once in their life. (With each viewing, I think it is appreciated more.) It's easy to get caught up in the action and to see where the plot takes the characters, and this film is a legend of prisoner of war films. You see references to it everywhere. I highly recommend 'The Great Escape'."
"Apart from the fact that it was a unique and great adventure epic, The Great Escape made important contributions to the career of a number of American and British male stars and would-be stars.   This was due in part to director/producer John Sturges' particular intuition for the choice of actors and to effective, well-balanced characterizations which served as vehicles to several their players.  Interestingly, none of the film's performers were big stars at the time and only McQueen, Garner and Attenbourough were well-known leading men.  Primarily, the movie of course launched Steve McQueen to major stardom, only a few years after Sturges' The Magnificent Seven established the actor's lone hero persona on the big screen.  McQueen stands out as a daring and cynical individualist, who appears unmoved and downright impertinent when being thrown in and out of the prison camp's cooler, and culminates in a classic motorcycle chase. But in a somewhat less glamorous manner, James Garner arguably gives a superior performance as the ""scrounger"", the prisoner gathering most of the essential materials of the escape through his wit, relaxed charm and resourcefulness. McQueen's admittedly impressive characterization sometimes comes a bit too close to parody and spectacular heroics, in the end lacking some credibility.  Garner, on the other hand, manages a more subtle, understated humour, not distracting from the seriousness of his work and the stakes involved in the escape.  Meanwhile, Richard Attenborough is also excellent as the mastermind of the escape, forcefully portraying a man convinced of his mission and ready to make sacrifices and ruthless decisions to achieve it.  From the rest of the cast, Charles Bronson probably stands out most, projecting strength and determination as the head of the tunnel diggers, while towards the end, effectively conveying a vulnerable, tortured side of his character (even though the fact that the ""Tunnel King"" turns out to be a closet claustrophobic stretches credibility somewhat).  Donald Pleasance gives some outstanding pieces of acting when his character gradually turns blind before the escape.  The evolution of his friendship with Garner provides an interesting plot and character development, as Pleasance's traditional British ways and habits contrasts amusingly with Garner's easy-going and open American style.  James Donald also does very well as the senior British officer, providing thoughtful, sensitive and self-effacing leadership.  The other protagonists do not have sufficient screen time to make their characters more than moderately interesting, but  James Coburn shines as a brash Australian who ends up escaping on a stolen bicycle, David McCallum has some brief but noticeable moments, particularly when disguised as a German civilian during his escape, and Gordon Jackson gives some bright support to Attenbourough, providing a human touch to balance the excessive seriousness of the latter's character.  The attention spent to the fate and personality traits of all these characters, enliven by the engaging and usually flawless acting of the players, had much to do in creating and maintaining the interest of The Great Escape, making it a lot more than a big and exciting action film.  For McQueen, Garner, Attenborough, Bronson, Coburn, Pleasance and McCallum, The Great Escape represents some of the finest moments in their long illustrious careers."
"If ever there was a film that calls for ensemble acting by an all-male cast, this is it. And no one lets you down--all are at the peak of their performing talents--James Garner, Steve McQueen, Richard Attenborough, Donald Pleasance, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, David McCallum.There is no letdown in the purely ""escapist"" overall enjoyment of the film either--sorry for the pun. At times, it seems almost like fun to be in a prisoner of war camp where everybody is so chummy and having a good time as they plot and plan their marvelous but dangerous escape. The plot whirls forward in such a breezy manner that it hardly seems possible the film is as lengthy as it is--well over two and a half hours. Details of the escape are photographed expertly.An impressive offbeat performance by Charles Bronson as the claustrophobic man who digs the tunnel comes as somewhat of a surprise. He turns out to be one of the few lucky escapees. After the escape, the film follows the adventures of several of them as, in turn, each one almost gets away with their plan. Only grim note in their adventures is the machine-gunning episode of 50 men who are told to get out of a truck in the middle of a field ""for exercise"". And a lasting impression is made by the vivid way the photography captures McQueen's brazen attempt to escape on motorbike through the Bavarian countryside. Stunningly photographed and impressively scored. McQueen's chase scene is nothing short of spectacular, best seen on wide screen version.Surprisingly, the only Oscar nomination was for film editing.
Escape films about POWs don't get any better--or more entertaining--than this one. By all means see it."
"The movie is absolutely ridiculous. The most overrated piece of art of all time.Let me tell you something. Unless you are British, you are going to hate this absolute dog of a film. And the British love it, just because a super-cool guy like Steve McQueen hangs out with the British folks and also for the main theme (let's all chant!).Accurate? German WW2 POW camp? Sounds more like summer camp to me! These people are caught trying to escape and the Nazis just take them by the hand to get them back in line. And they still wear their uniforms, not some prison overalls -which is the first thing the Germans would do: take off their pride. It's a joke really! Let me be more specific: the English (and the one American) can do WHATEVER they want in this camp, while the Nazis are just waiting for someone to escape in order to get them back in prison. And what about those secret meetings! The Germans were minding their own business, while the POWs were designing plots to escape. Yeah, right!Apart from all that, the movie is boring, not going anywhere. No acts of heroism, no surprises, no script, no women.I wouldn't care for the story if at least there was some realism in this horrible movie, but a parody is all you get. If instead of McQueen it was Leslie Nielsen, we would have a great comedy.0/10 (what a joke!)"
"OK, here We go. 8.3 Rating on IMDb...93% on Rotten Tomatoes...#119 in the Top 250 Films of All Time. What's the Point?...An Exercise in Futility...Spitting in the Wind...Tugging on Superman's Cape...But Let's Mess Around a Bit, just because We can.This is one of the Most Overrated Movies Ever. John Sturgess also Directed The Magnificent Seven (1960). So there is The GREAT Escape and The MAGNIFICENT Seven, so You know where this Guy's Head is, way up there in the Clouds, Nowhere near Earth and Reality, just like this Fabrication. Because this is Comic Book Stuff. The Director seems to have been Influenced by Stan Lee, the Creator of The FANTASTIC Four, The AMAZING Spider Man, and The INCREDIBLE Hulk. This Film is Hollywood Pablum. Glossy and Superficial. The Acting is Average and the Star Power is Typical of these Types of Movies that Parade ""Names"" around on Screen and in Ads to make the Thing seem more Important than it Actually is. It is Entertaining to a Point and is Watchable because it is just so Sweet, never Achieving Anything remotely Suspenseful or Terrifying, or really Very Exciting. Can Anyone say with a Straight Face that Steve McQueen's Motorcycle Chase is Riveting Cinema. It must also be said that Hogan's Heroes, that Long Running and Popular TV COMEDY, was Certainly Inspired by this, because when all is Said and Done, this is Nothing but a Long, Lightweight, Immensely Popular Movie Showing what Fun is to be had in a German POW Camp."
"But I am not from the generation of this film. People I know who were around when this film was released assure me that McQueen was the epitome of cool. The problem is that ""cool's eternal, but it's always dated."" I can see how he coudl have been viewed as cool, but the story behind the film seems, to me, mediocre at best. The music is well-known and enjoyable, but the story of the film could have been a much deeper statement about the futility of war, and what does it end up being? A place to watch McQueen showboat. My opinions could be totally misplaced here; but I did not see anything spectacular about this film. Stalag-17 seems a much greater film with a similar story.ZooTrouble"
"Fun, optimistic prisoner-of-war movie about a group of Allied POWs put into a German camp exclusively for those who tend to try to escape. Thus, they try to escape, en masse. Care is put into the camaraderie, personality, and general friendliness of most of the characters, while showing in a couple scenes how nevertheless the imprisoned life is slowly demoralizing some of the men.The escape itself is interesting, but the movie really didn't focus a lot on the watchful Goons (Nazis), making it seem at times as if the whole camp is given free reign to just do what they choose--obviously, making escape much more likely. Somehow I kind of expect the whole ordeal that this movie is based off of was a bit more challenging and paranoid, and I would have liked to see that.Where the movie does get really good is post-escape, as the several characters split ways and attempt to get out of the country, to various results. Steve McQueen's bike chase is, of course, a famous scene, made all the more silly by the knowledge that McQueen himself is the one who suggested it, and all the more riveting because his own bike is used and he also doubled for one of the Germans, meaning in this movie Steve McQueen chases himself. One thing few prison or prisoner-of-war escape movies tend to focus on is the problem of getting back into the world after outside the prison walls--those movies tend to assume that once the tunnel is dug, freedom is pretty much a skip and a leap away. It's much more compelling to see the POWs trying to blend in, sneak through, hide, steal, row, ride, and fly their way out of the country.--PolarisDiB"
"I gave this film a 9 out of 10. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because it tells one lie. No Americans actually participated in the escape.It is a historical fact that the escape was originally to be made by the Americans, but their tunnel, Tom, was discovered by German camp guards just a few days before the scheduled break. The movie shows how Tom was busted, but unfortunately does not reveal that it was the American tunnel. The second tunnel, Dick, was used instead, but that particular tunnel originated in a British barracks; therefore all the escapees were in fact British soldiers.Other than that, the rest of the details were unusually accurate, given the fact that Hollywood is not well known for sticking with facts. The Great Escape is an excellent chronology of a group of brave men attempting a nearly-impossible task with an amazing degree of success.The actual escape belongs on the list of greatest human efforts in history, and the movie belongs on the list of greatest films ever made."
"THE GREAT ESCAPE is a history adventure drama which describes, in a commercial way, an escape from a German stalag during World War II. The film is based on Paul Brickhill's 1950 book of the same name.In 1943, the Germans have moved all the prisoners of war, who are prone to running away, to a new high-security prisoner of war camp. Their commandant points out the various features of the new camp designed to prevent escape, as well as the advantages that the prisoners will receive as incentive not to try. After several failed attempts on the first day, the prisoners settle into life at the camp. Meanwhile, Gestapo agents bring the infamous ""Big X"" in the camp. He is introduced as the principal escape organizer. His attempt to escape will be punished by death. However, he, with the support of other escape artists, who are detained in the camp, plans the greatest escape ever attempted, with tunnels to break out 250 prisoners...The story is exciting and tense, with a lot of charm and humor. Unfortunately, it is stuck somewhere between fiction and truth. The characters are based on real men. However, the commercialization of this film, which can not credibly to follow historical facts, has made some damage. The protagonists are defiant, arrogant, disobedient, surprisingly resourceful and entertaining. Well, that is a successful Hollywood trick. The point has remained obscure. The tragic epilogue ends with a smile on the face of one of the rebels. Characterization is very good, given the large number of actors. There is no depth, but it is somewhat expected. Their expression has an amplitude only in a few scenes.Steve McQueen as Capt. Virgil Hilts, the ""Cooler King"" is a rebellious and persistent character. He is a subtle link between the two hostile sides. A baseball and glove are too excessive segments. However, his performance is very good. James Garner as Flt. Lt. Robert Hendley, the ""Scrounger"" is a creative and mysterious character. The credibility of his character is quite impaired, in a maximum-security prison, regardless of an apparent change in the second part of the film. Richard Attenborough as Sqn. Ldr. Roger Bartlett, ""Big X"" is, maybe, too quiet for a notorious prisoner or a great leader. He's a brain of their operation, in which the other participants have a greater role than him. However, he is their balance. Charles Bronson as Flt. Lt. Danny Velinski, the ""Tunnel King"", is an irreplaceable base of their operation. A melodrama of his character is a little exaggerated in climatic moments. Donald Pleasence as Flt. Lt. Colin Blythe, the ""Forger"" has offered the best performance of all the actors in this film. His humorous character becomes his personal tragedy and despair from which is born a strange friendship. James Coburn as Fg. Off. Louis Sedgwick, the ""Manufacturer"" is a man who finds himself in the right place at the right time. James Donald as Gp. Capt. Ramsey, the Senior British Officer (SBO) is a serious and calm captain who has a broad perception of the events around him.There is no strong emotions, everything is mechanically aligned.However, I enjoyed it."
"This is one of the greatest movies of all time! Based on true story of real events by Paul Brickhill, with a great cast. This particular movie is a family favorite which brings my teenage daughter out from her room and may inspire and stir you too.The story of allied POWs with a knack and desire to escape - these escape artists have all been placed in one basket, Stalag Luft 3 - so the Germans can watch that one basket closely. The Stalag commander does not see the soldiers attempts to escape as ""a matter of levity."" Steve McQueen, James Garner, James Coburn, Charles Bronson, and Richard Attenborough are part of an all-star cast which tell the story of captured allied soldiers. Along with the all-star cast, great directing, a fantastic musical score, and great writing combine to make this a favorite for many. The editing in The Great Escape is excellent, smooth, natural and unobtrusive. One of the major scenes which communicates this excellently is the motorcycle chase scene where Steve McQueen appears to jump the barbed wire barricades. McQueen did complete many of the motorcycle scenes, riding through the hills of Germany, he even did many of shots where he dressed in a German uniform and appeared to be the soldiers. McQueen was actually an avid motorcyclist, appearing in the documentary On Any Sunday and would race in local races under the name Harvey Mushman.Sound has frequent rich wood, leather, and wool, and tin metal sound effects added during movements that give a sense of being surrounded by dirty wood floors and cheap metal. The music score transitions, coupled with wise-cracking personalities, add to the character development and sense of understanding what's happening and about to happen. This movie is even parodied by the animated movie ""Chicken Run,"" where chickens try to escape by digging a tunnel away from their chicken farm and Germany has a similar story based on true events that are told in the film ""The One That Got Away,"" by Roy Baker about a German pilot shot down in England. Stories about intestinal fortitude and insurmountable odds never get old. This is a film I can watch every year and never get tired of watching - this is not movie propaganda! You read it."
"Always got a kick out of McQueen leading the escapees from the tunnel while trying to stay inconspicuous in those khakis! But then, as his character says, the escape hole was opened short of the woods.
Oh, whatever. This is great 'they don't make them like that anymore' film. What a cast!
What a soundtrack! I still get goosebumps watching McQueen on that motorcycle fleeing the Germans- and the music that accompanies
that whole scene.
Still enjoying a true classic in 2018!"
"I think this is the movie I've seen more than 20 times in my life and I'm not tired because I want to see it again and again.
The first time was when I was a kid and my father told me you have to see it and I thanks him for that.
It is based on a true story wich makes it more emotional and sensitive.
I definitely, recomend this movie to everyone. In my opinion, one of the best of the history."
"Steve McQueen, James Garner, Richard Attonbourgh, Charles Bronson, Donald Pleasence, James Coburn. How can you make a bad movie from this stellar cast? The Great Escape is a classic war/adventure film. Although it is more than that. It is an exciting escape film filled with great acting, exciting action and suspenseful moments. It really has the whole package. 
You could easily argue when it comes to historical accuracy but I hardly take that into account anymore unless it is detrimental to the story. It is not all action though. Much of the movie is exposition but the dialogue is well written and the actors do such a good job that it is hard to turn away. 
Director John Sturges is a personal favorite director of mine and he does a great job here. It is a classic epic that is a necessity for classic movie and action movie fans."
"The great escape
Six-hundred American and English officers worked together for a year to plan and execute the escape of a nazi prisoners'camp in 1944, the biggest ever attempted in militar history. This great picture tells that real history with a great cast of actors as the instigators of the escape: the main British organizer is Richard Attenborough; the expert on tinnels is Charles Bronson; the role of especialist in forging documents belongs to Donald Pleasence; the one in charge of the supplies is played by James Garner and finally, the guy who comes up with the brilliant ideas is for Steve Mcqueen. Bases on a real story, The Great Escape is a masterwork by director John Sturges (The magnificient seven), the scripwriters James Clavell and W.R. Burnett, and the composer, Elmer Bernstein, whose score adjusts like a glove to the film's ever increasing tension.So much for the summary of the movie. Let's get stuck into it, shall we?. It's one of those adventures films like Master and Comander and The Treasure Island that somehow take place inside a concentration camp in Germany. Steve Mcqueen stands out above the rest of the characters because of his almost poetic determination to get out as well as his heroe-like attitude. His stunts (I'd like to believe he did them himself) with the motorcycle towards the end of the picture blew my mind away, making me to jump off my seat and shout out loud: you're gonna make it! Eventually he doesn't. That's not the point though: the point is he managed to prove, to keep up hope when there was none!"
"And I should have put 'execution' between two crosses, but it might have given away the film's ending (and problem) despite the spoiler warning. Anyway, I start my review.For some reason, it took me till my 35th year to discover ""The Great Escape"". That's the catch with classics; they're so iconic you never really ""discover"" them. From that Simpsons' episode parodying the great escape with Maggie's glorious quest for the hidden pacifier, driven by Elmer Bernstein's score (and a cool nod to the ""cooler"" scene), I knew ""The Great Escape"". Of course, I can also mention the parodies of Steve McQueen's climactic motorcycle jump over the barbed wires and the stellar cast so typical of these testosterone-laden action flicks of the 60's, ""Guns of Navarone"", ""The Dirty Dozen"" and of course, John Sturges' previous classic ""The Magnificent Seven"".I thought I knew everything about the film and needless to say that I heightened my expectation so high they really crashed into the realization that I've been misinformed all along. I love a movie that surprises me but I didn't expect that film to end that way. To put it simply: well, no one really escaped and those who did ended up being executed in the most cold-blooded and anti-climactic way. Now that was one downer ending that I didn't see coming, but it makes sense since the film insisted so much that it was based on a true story, only names were changed (the leader Burshell became Bartlett, played by an excellent Richard Attenborough) and some characters were composite of real-life personalities. Also no Americans took part to the escape but the producers wanted to include Steve McQueen and give him a substantial role. This is where the film gets more problematic.As long as I was convinced that it would culminate with the spectacular jump, it was all worth the dated elements. Every member of the organization had a cool-nickname, James Garner the Scrounger, Donald Pleasance the Forger, Charles Bronson the Tunnel King, James Coburn the Manufacturer and McQueen has the coolest of all, The Cooler King, every guy is bad-ass in a way or another, every element of the escape is handled with the kind of meticulous precision the film can only get away with it on its ""true story"" premise, and there's that upbeat music from Bernstein.There's never a moment where you film the Germans in their usual mercilessness, the life in the camp seems pretty idle and we accept the notion of a POW having to escape as a duty in order to disorient the enemy and create as much confusion as possible. But there's never a moment where you feel that lives are at stakes, on an individual level maybe, but no in a crime-of-war ""fashion"".As long as I expected a great escape, I enjoyed every bit of the film. But then something happened: Steve McQueen crashed on the barbed-wire fences and surrendered. If McQueen, the Cooler King didn't make it, then there was nothing really great about that escape. But the final nail on the coffin of my disappointment was the execution. I had followed Bartlett and McCallum all through the film and while their finale exchange before they hear the machine gun getting armed is poignant and beautifully done, the film had lost me. The bonus features went on great lengths about the real operation: what a tragic ending, what a waste of lives. I love the unease of the camp officer when announcing that everyone was dead, and when James Donald is told that fifty prisoners were shot while escaping and there was no wounded, it was easy to connect the dots.In a way, this was a story that needed to be told, it is powerful and it does pay a tribute to these tragic heroes, the fifty who underestimated the cruelty of the enemy, but the way the escape is all set-up makes the ending feel like belonging to another movie. All the gags, the funny moments had lost their charm and worse, I felt that Steve McQueen wasn't fit for the film, which is perhaps the worst thing you can say about it. I don't mean I wish he wasn't in the film but it's obvious (and it's proved in the trivia) that McQueen wanted to have a role as big as in ""Magnificent Seven"" and this time he had no YulBrynner to rival with, no need to touch his hat or enhance his presence, his presence enhanced the film but not for the best. McQueen is as cool as an ice cube on a glass of potato vodka. But this film called for a 'Papillon' performance, when it ends with the same cooler moment, and the theme started playing, I didn't feel any reason to smile or be happy.This aspect is also represented by the Forger's arc, Donald Pleasance plays the man who goes blind and thanks to the Scrounger's help, he manages to slip through the net until Garner decides to fly a plane in a scene that seems like gratuitous action spice and leading to his killing anyway. Of course, the weak, bald, blind guy didn't fit and Garner goes back to the camp without a scratch. McQueen goes back, learns about the deaths and then goes play ball in his cooler. The film is the weirdest cocktail of emotions, being too cinematic for its tragic material.I enjoyed every bit of it at first, it sure has the thrills, the cast, the music, but the ending called for a more serious treatment. I guess I was mislead, but even the story is about people who were mislead by some misconception and ending executed. I still can't give the film a six given how iconic it is, so I give it a 7 but not magnificent one."
"Over rated  action/drama WW 2 escape film that suffers from extreme HOLLYWOOD formula watering down directng style.The acting was good but the soundtrack was very condescending and the atmosphere had no grit at all.All this was done on purpose by the film makers though as they targeted  a more artistically challenged GENERAL AUDIENCE crowd.A how to for DISNEY STYLE war films.The result is a movie that had potential to be a MASTERPIECE CLASSIC but merely achieves a good rating.Also,blatant script inconsistensies can be very irritating to intelligent people, like Charles Bronson masterfully digging incredible tunnels like a super human Mole,then all of a sudden inexplicably turns into a CLAUSRTROPHOBIAC for over dramatic effect?!Please!If you want a great WW 2 escape film,check out BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER KWAI,VICTORY or STALAG 17 for that matter........"
"I bought the dvd after reading how great it was here on imdb. Well, I must say, Im glad it only cost me 13$. The acting was bad and so was the score. A thru and tragic story ruined by Hollywood. Did not feel anything for the caracters. I belive the experinece of it was more dramatic, tragic and sad than the movie got to tell. Very bad storytelling."
"Wait. comedy? This is a war movie. Yes, it is supposed to be. It is not. What was planned as a serious, deep, psychological wartime escape drama, in reality turned into a raw, unbaked, half-cooked slapstick with awful character development, with awful performances, especially those from McQueen and Bronson, need one mention terribly laughable and horribly unserious delivery. The whole thing seems like a lame amateurish school play with absolutely irregular moves and wrong lines. I never, but never believed a single thing they said or did. The whole film just smacks of a cheap second-rate low-budget effort of a mediocre dubious merit. There is no merit, as even actors betray a playful unseriousness of what they say or do. Does the movie ever seem to be tragic or decent? Nay, even the killing spree seems to be staged or simply poor. Poor - this is the word. Every little detail in this film is poor or false."
"I don't understand why so many people love this movie. There is nothing great about this escape. Since a majority of POWs who escaped were recaptured or killed, the title is misleading. I'm not saying every film should have a happy ending, but how about featuring the people who actually got away. If you think about it, escaping from a POW camp and getting recaptured at the end after following the details of the escape for nearly three hours is a bit of a cheat. This is one of those films that should have not been historically accurate. As reading previous reviews I have read, the movie was unrealistic as it was they might as well gone all the way with it. This mix of historical accuracy and Hollywood doesn't mix together very well. A disappointing 5/10"
"The great escape, with all of its fame, winds up being quite a disappointment for me. There is just no emotional attachment to any of the characters from this movie. The Germans allow the prisoners wonder around, the whole prison camp feel more like a summer camp than a WWII prison camp. The work camp in the movie ""holes"" was 10 times tougher on its residents than this prison camp, and that was only a juvenile correctional camp. The entire movie seem to be constructed to build the ""hero"" characters portrayed by McQueen. There're so many people here proclaim this is Steve McQueen's best work. Well I am not very familiar with Steve McQueen, but his acting job, while completely competent, sure is nothing to write home about. The entire movie is unnecessarily lengthy and drawn out while at the same time completed devoid of the spirit of the brave men keeping their fight going even under imprisonment. It feels more like a teen schemed, prank fest than a epic tale of heroism. Someone here stated this is as much of a WWII movie as ""Saving Private Ryan"". I say comparing this movie to saving private Ryan is like comparing a Saturday morning cartoon to Shakespeare."
"Performance by the characters leaves behind the direction. Steve McQueen is no doubt the star performer with his bike chase and all. The plot is gripping towards the end. The Germans guards in the prison are shown to be incredibly lenient. Imagine which prison (that too German) would give such mild punishments to its inmate for escaping the 17th time! The movie is all about smart ideas to escape from the prison and there the movie scores pretty well. I am not saying it outwits modern day movies but its quite realistic.Its quite exciting to imagine yourself (temporarily!) in place of the prisoners. Despite the leverage the movie deserves for being based on a true story, the movie is a good watch. I give it a 7."
