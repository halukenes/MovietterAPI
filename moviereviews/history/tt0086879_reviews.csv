Reviews
"I'd like to point out a few facts before I review the movie. First of all, Mozart died at home surrounded by his family, pupil and a priest. Secondly, the plot of Amadeus is not exactly original. Rimsky-Korsakov wrote a short opera called ""Mozart and Salieri"" with the bare bones of the story and the identical characterization of the two composers, and he used Pushkin's drama for the libretto. So, the rumor that Salieri killed Mozart has been around for almost a couple of centuries though we all know there isn't an iota of veracity in it.That being said, Peter Shaffer's movie adaptation of his own play is still an astounding achievement. Have you ever seen a movie based on your favorite book and come out of the movie theater rather disappointed though the film version faithfully followed the storyline of the book? Amadeus is definitely not one of those movies. Shaffer clearly understands the difference between stage and film; the story is more elaborate in the movie, and some of the lengthy lines are replaced with more subtle images and close-ups.I'm often surprised to find that people don't get that Amadeus is the story of the fictionalized character, Antonio Salieri, not the real one, who adored Mozart's music but hated everything else about him. In other words, the movie viewers are seeing Mozart through Salieri's eyes. Needless to say, his view is rather slanted. If you have read Shaffer's original play, you probably remember he describes Mozart's laugh 'grating.' In the film, this annoying laugh becomes more symbolic. Though Salieri speaks in front of a Catholic priest, he is actually having a one-sided discourse with God. At one point, he declares, ""One day, I will laugh at you. Before I leave this earth, I will laugh at you."" But as he is wheeled out of his room by an aide at the asylum, what we hear is that screeching laugh of Mozart--or is it? It becomes obvious as we watch that this movie is called Amadeus because that's what Salieri wished to be--God's beloved.The movie might give some viewers who don't know much about Mozart a wrong impression that he was a cad, and it gives incorrect information on some of his music (e.g.; the count in The Marriage of Figaro sings ""Contessa perdono"" AFTER he learns that the woman dressed in the maid's clothes is his own wife. There's no mistaken identity here. Read the title of the song--Countess, forgive me!), but these are minor offenses. Though I am a die-hard Mozart fan, I can laugh at tongue-in-cheek references to Amadeus in other movies. My favorite? In Guarding Tess, a secret service agent tells his partner, ""He (Mozart)'s a jerk. One day, a guy shows up with a mask, and he drops dead."" What's not to like about Amadeus? The tale Peter Shaffer tells is gripping, the actors are first- rate, and, of course, there's music. The selection of Mozart's music in the movie is excellent; you can truly enjoy the beauty of his music no matter how much or how little you know about it. In case you are wondering, a little tune Mozart plays on his back and hands crossed as a penalty at a party is Viva Bacchus from The Abduction from the Seraglio, a duet for Pedrillo and Osmin. Pedrillo, while singing this song, is trying to get Osmin, the harem guard, drunk to help his master rescue his true love. No wonder Schikaneder calls it 'our song.' And the improvised version of Salieri's welcome march is actually a famous song, Non piu andrai farfallone amoroso, from The Marriage of Figaro.As I said, I'm a huge Mozart fan, so my rating may be somewhat biased, but what the heck, I gladly give ten stars to Amadeus. I watched it close to a hundred times over the years, and it still gives me a great pleasure every time I see (and hear) it."
"Before I saw this movie, I respected Mozart's genius, but his music wasn't my cup of tea. Beethoven was more to my taste, I tended more toward heavier classics. But this movie moved me to tears, especially at the end when they did Mozart's REQUIEM while he was working on what was to be his last piece of music. Now, I'm a Mozart fiend. This was a great movie. True, there are some historical inaccuracies. Anyone who has studied music history knows that Sallieri did not help Mozart with his Requiem. It was a student of his named Sussmayer. But it does make this story ironic, that the man who was so dedicated to the ruination of Mozart ended up helping him in the end. (I question the historical accuracy of that as well.) I recently bought the director's cut to this movie. Until I saw the director's cut, Sallieri seemed like a more sympathetic character, someone who just couldn't buy a break. Who can't identify with that? But after seeing the director's cut and seeing what I think is an important scene between Sallieri and Mozart's wife, he seemed more like a jerk. You also understand why Frau Mozart was so rude to Sallieri at the end of the movie, whereas before, you see the next to the last scene and you think, ""Whoa! Where did this come from?"" This was a great movie, for entertainment value only. If you want historical accuracy, watch a documentary or read a biography from the library or something. Because of this movie, I am now a rabid Mozart fan. If the movie can make Mozart converts, then it can't be bad at all."
"SPOILER: Amadeus is an extremely well written story, covering the last ten years of Mozart's massively prolific yet unusual life.  I have read much that it paints a rather inaccurate picture of the genius's life, and yet I am not dissuaded from ranking this film as one of the greatest made.  The historical problem should be addressed first, because it draws the most criticism.  I would advise anyone to shut out the self-righteous whining of those people who fancy themselves as Mozart experts, when they really have little solid evidence for their assertions.  History is only seen by us in fragments, be they documents or eye witness accounts.  These fragments certainly do not amount to a full picture of events, and so Milos Forman and Peter Schaeffer are perfectly entitled to form their own story of genius.This issue aside, the picture is one of fantastic colour and scale, crammed with lavish costumes and wonderful architecture.  This keeps the eyes occupied, but the ears get the biggest reward.  The film uses a large amount of Mozart's music, and does so in a way which is carefully considered. For example, when the insane and enfeebled Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) reminisces on the sheer beauty of Mozart's compositions, we hear music to match his words, ""And there... an oboe, high and unwavering... until a clarinet takes over, and forms a phrase of such longing...""  The effect is deeply moving.  Examples of this collaboration of music and picture are many; when Mozart (Tom Hulce) swaggers through the streets of Vienna taking swigs from a bottle of wine, we hear a jolly piano concerto; and he is hurled into a mass grave to the sorrowful Lacrimosa of his requiem mass. The music should move any viewer, however much they confess to hating anything classical.  If you haven't seen this film, watch, or rather listen, for the scene where Salieri inspects samples of Mozart's music.  The originality in switching the music as he turns the pages is profound. The acting is superb, particularly from Abraham.  Hulce's cackle provides comic relief, and his wonderfully child-like mannerisms are testament not only to his acting skills, but to Forman's exceptional direction and vision. On the other hand, we are shown two moments of antithesis, namely when he is composing at his billiards table (his face taking on a look of such mature concentration), and when he is dictating his Confutatis to Salieri. Yes, we do get to see Mozart compose, and talk about tonic, dominant, second measures, etc.  I would have preferred to have seen more of his thought processes though, because Forman's glimpse of how Mozart applied his genius is extremely exciting to watch, but short lived. Characterisations are brilliantly engineered.  Salieri is scheming and yet outwardly indifferent to Mozart.  We can see that he loves the music of his superior, and yet is torn apart by his own inadequacy.  Inadequacy is a fitting word for Salieri's skill as portrayed by Forman, who wanted to give the greatest contrast possible in terms of the virtuosity of the two men, without making Salieri look like a complete cretin.  He is, after all, known as maestro Salieri.  Constanze Mozart (Elizabeth Berridge) is on first appearances a giggling girl, and yet through the course of the film we are shown that she is very shrewd, and is ruthless when dealing with finance. Roy Dotrice's Leopold Mozart has a masterful air, and maintains an oppressive paternal hold over his son even after his death, the analogy being the use of an enveloping cloak.  The cloak is used as part of Leopold's street wear, but is also part of the costume of the statue in the first showing of Don Giovanni, where Salieri is certain that the imposing figure of the giant statue represents the recently deceased Leopold.  In short, Forman presents us with a marvelous psychological essay on weakness and power, both superficial and real.  This is obviously no average biographical motion picture, but a film conceived with an intelligence nearing that of it's subject. We are shown Mozart's virtuosity several times, which again provides wonderful excitement.  He not only plays variations of his music thought up on the spot (at the party scene) but plays them in the styles of other composers, upside down.  He infuriates Salieri by arranging a welcoming march actually written for Mozart (and taken to be wonderful by the Italian up to this point), showing off his outstanding skills whilst looking around at the assembled courtiers and cackling with glee.  Those who have watched this scene with me have either laughed or smiled in sheer wonderment at a majestic combination of music, acting and direction. This film is a gem, combining sometimes ridiculous comedy with deep tragedy.  On the negative side, it would benefit opera buffs more than concert goers, because opera is the dominant musical genre of the movie. (Specially designed opera productions have been woven into the film; greatly extending it's length but adding that extra colour and vibrancy).  The film becomes heavy and slow moving as it nears its astonishingly refreshing conclusion at the lunatic asylum, noticeable largely due to the contrast with a lighter beginning.  This may test the patience of some viewers, but once the credits roll, I guarantee that the majority of those who have watched Amadeus will be struck by the passing of such a wonderfully colourful and rewarding masterpiece, and will not want to move from their seats until the tranquil piano concerto fades away.  The film deserves all its eight Oscars, and I give it 9 out of 10."
"In 1984, Saul Zaentz, Peter Shaffer and Milos Forman collaborated in bringing a truly remarkable life to the silver screen. The story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, through the eyes of rival composer, Antonio Salieri. The film is complete with an insightful script (courtesy of Mr. Shaffer), magnificent acting, wondrous sets and costume designs, incredible choreography (thanks to Twyla Tharp), and, above all, the glorious music of Mozart himself.The movie of Salieri's life, through which Mozart played an integral part, is told in flashback mode, beginning in around the year 1822. An old and perhaps emotionally disturbed Antonio Salieri attempts suicide, and in doing so, apologizes for killing Mozart some 31 years earlier. He survives and is admitted to an insane asylum, where he tells a young priest his tale of jealousy and mediocrity.The priest is fascinated and alternately troubled by the lengthy and emotional story. Salieri tells of growing up in Italy with a father who did not care for music; and how he rejoiced for the chance to go to Vienna after his father's untimely death. He tells of how he first had met the young Mozart, and how immature and dirty minded Mozart was. He also tells of how ""The Creature"" had an intimate relationship with the girl that Salieri had cared for. Most importantly, however, he confided in the priest that he had learned to hate God for giving him a deep love of  music, only to deny him the talent to create truly memorable music. He thought God had given him Mozart to mock him. Salieri's heart filled with such rage, such hatred and such jealousy, that he had vowed to himself to make God an enemy and to kill the young Mozart.As the movie moves along, carrying with it a deep sadness of the human condition, it also celebrates life by giving the audience joyous music, wonderful atmosphere and a general appreciation of humanity for not only eighteenth century Europe, but in any age where music speaks for our emotions.The movie won eight Academy Awards in March of 1985. The only reason it did not win nine was that Tom Hulce was nominated for best actor instead of best supporting actor. He actually was in a supporting role, and in a strange twist of irony, F. Murray Abraham won the best actor statuette; citing probably the only time when Salieri beat out Mozart in anything.The movie itself was shot in Prague where Milos Forman said ""(It) is a gem because it's possible to pivot the camera a full three hundred and sixty degrees and never encounter a modern vision."" Very few new sets had to be built, as the scenes and buildings they found were quite often apropos to their needs.Amadeus works well on virtually every cinematic plane that exists. It is a masterpiece that must be viewed multiple times to receive what the film has to offer. The emotions of humanity, through the eyes of the troubled Salieri, indeed speak for all of mediocrity. He is their champion and their king."
"It is because of this movie that I began listening to Classical music. Up to the age of 20 I wouldn't listen to anything but rock, rap, hip hop, punk. Then I fell in love with Mozart. And because of this epiphany I went on to listen to other styles of music such as country (Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Hank Williams), Edith Piaf, Al Jolson, and so on. This movie is breathtaking. A knockout and I wish I could see it on the big screen! Tom Hulce was wonderful as Mozart! Elizabeth Berridge who plays his wife Constanza looks eerily like the real Constanza judging from portraits of the great composer's wife. F. Murray Abraham deservedly won the Oscar for his outstanding turn as Mozart's arch enemy-fellow composer Antonio Salieri who was NOT a 'mediocrity'! He was a brilliant composer in his own right. It is just that there are the fair, the good, the great-and then there are the gifted. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was one of the gifted. When it comes to music even the un-trained ear can tell that God kissed the man right on the lips. And there was nothing Salieri could do about it. He could train in music for a million years and he still could not come close to the genius that was Mozart-who's ""Eine Kleine Nachtmuzik"" is recognizable today even to non-classical music fans."
One of the greatest movies of all time. This is a movie that speaks for itself. Beautiful Cinematography and stellar performances by all especially F. Murray Abraham who carries the film. Tom Hulce was a terrific choice for this movie.  True this is historically incorrect but it doesn't matter this film works on so many different levels... the music ahhh the music. Mozart is pure genius and his music touches this film and everyone involved. You can just sense that Mozart's inspiration drove everyone on this film to perfection. A must see film for all!
"I remember as a child, my sister told me to watch this film. That it was the best film she ever saw. I didn't watch it until I turned 10; finally I sat myself down and watched it. I fell in love with it.Based on the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, played a terrific and hilarious performance by Tom Hulce. This also has the life of Antonio Salieri, a great and well deserved Oscar winning performance by F. Murray Abraham. Despite the story not being accurate, come on! This is a great movie that was a gigantic Oscar waiting to happen. Congrats to Amaudeus for bringing the beauty of classical music into out living rooms.The story is that we start off with an older and more suicidal Salieri who blames himself for Mozart's death. When a priest comes to ask Salieri to plead forgiveness to the lord and wants to council him, Salieri describes who he was and how music inspired his life, he plays a few notes from his opera's that were masterpieces, the priest just looks at him not knowing the music. Salieri just looks at him with a smile and says ""Ah, how about...?"", he plays Mozart's most famous work and the priest gets excited saying ""Oh, how charming! I'm sorry, I didn't know you wrote that!"" smiling and knowing how it will please Salieri, Salieri just looks at him with a emotionless face ""I didn't. That was Mozart, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart"" and you see the priest's embarrassment. Just great and a perfectly played out performance by Abraham and Frank.Tom Hulce gives Mozart this crazy and annoying yet nevertheless funny laugh that you can't help but laugh at it every time he does it. He brings such life to Mozart and an immaturity that I think some of us can relate too in being spoiled and always knowing you're the best at your talent. He marries Constanze played by Elizabeth Berridge and she does it remarkably well. Constanze is obviously the more mature one and is the only woman who can try to tame Mozart's crazy ways. When Salieri gets a little jealous that the emperor played by an under rated Jeffrey Jones, since he is the emperor's tutor, then the emperor demands more of Mozart and his music. Salieri vs. Mozart: on the next celebrity death match!""Amadeus"" is a fantastic movie that anyone could easily love and enjoy. It's definitely a must see for movie fans and anyone in general who is just looking for a good movie. This was the best picture of 1984 and it's well deserved, just trust me and the awesome reviews it's getting!10/10"
"The unseen star of this film is the Academy of St Martin's in the Field, London. Buy the soundtrack and you will be rewarded with some of the most stunning music you can hear. Mozart's music excells with brilliant treatment and dies with a bad performance. And that, after all, is what the film is about. Without his music, Mozart would be lost in time, a fate that the narrator of the story, the composer Salieri, saw as his own. Ironically, while Salieri has indeed been completely overshadowed by Mozart, his music still survives and has its followers.But beyond the music this is an outstanding film. Set in the prettiest and most flamboyant century of the last millennium, it is visually stunning and the writer's portrayal of jealousy is perceptive. The casting of the Austrian King and courtiers, (indeed all the actors in this film) that Mozart needed to impress capture the gentility and courtesy of the time, and also subtly shows their growing indignation and impatience at Mozart's personality and behaviour; the presentation of Mozart as punk musician is probably the only failing in the film. As a theatrical device to show that genius can come in disastrous packages it succeeds well, but anyone with any historic sense of social ettiquette or manners will know that Mozart's sill y behaviour would be well wide of the truth, as might, perhaps, be the concept of Salieri as murderer-in-chief. Only in the final scenes is Mozart's brilliance as a composer truly explored in what amounts to a deconstruction of his final composition - his moving, uncompleted and poignant Requiem mass.Another unintended star in this film are the candle lit sets and theatres of the 18th Century; their operas and drama ooze a magic  that is lacking in the present world and which modern producers might well try to reintroduce; so lovely are these buildings with their flickering lights and theatrical techniques that one is left desperate to to seek out these rare theatres to experience them.This film leaves one breathless from its visual beauty, its magnificent score and the choreography, indeed, of the two together. Mozart's life had the air of tragedy, and his undoubted genius speaks to us now and forever. This film is a monument to the skills of the writer, maker, performers and, of course, Mozart's music. If you have not yet done so, see it."
"""Amadeus"" is a great film that is deep, thought-provoking, and overall exceptional.  The film deals with the last few months of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's (Oscar-nominee Tom Hulce) life, told in flashbacks by an old, washed-up musician named Antonio Salieri (Oscar-winner F. Murray Abraham). Salieri tells of the genius, the ingenuity, and the insanity of the young musician who died mysteriously at the age of 35.  Salieri's jealousy may have led him to kill the young composer, but that is something that will never be known.  ""Amadeus"" is an interesting commentary that tries to fill holes in history and succeeds amazingly.  By mixing fact and probable fiction, the film-makers succeeded in creating a truly remarkable motion picture that is easily one of the best of the 1980s.  5 stars out of 5."
"Amadeus is one tremendous film. The acting was great. Tom Hulce did wonderful and I have only seen him once in a film and that was Animal House. The rest of the cast was great to like F. Murry Abraham did a terrific job in his performance. The music was brilliant, I have never seen a film with such great performances in their plays. I really did admire this movie, everything in it was very interesting and after I watched the film I did a little research on Mozart. The script and directing was superb and the cinematography was brilliant. I couldn't of asked for a better film than Amadeus. I'm glad I saw this film!Hedeen's outlook: 10/10!! **** A+"
"""Amadeus"", while historically inaccurate in numerous ways, is a brilliant film.  Its central character is not a man but an attribute of man at his most remarkable: genius.  Mozart's genius was at the highest level, on par with Shakespeare, Michelangelo and Balanchine.  Forman knew this when he undertook translating Peter Shaffer's play.  Although most of the acting is on a very high plane, the actors themselves are not top tier, not should they be.  A famous, easily recognizable actor would have detracted from the central thesis that genius is greater than the one on whom it has been entrusted.  Mozart was, of course, deeper than the character shown in the movie, but no personal life could equal the extent and depth of the musical genius that flowed from this little man.  The letters he sent to his father show a remarkable sensitivity and depth of understanding.  However, they are not paradigms of literary greatness.  The immense contribution of W. A. Mozart lay in some of the most sublime music ever written.  Fortunately, the film gave us snippets of some of the real gems in the Mozart canon: the great C Minor Mass, the Requiem and ""Don Giovanni"".  Forman realized that no human being will ever be great enough or have the background to pen such masterpieces without intervention from elsewhere.  This is certainly true of Shakespeare as well.  So what we have here, ultimately, is a celebration of genius, that great gift to mankind that nearly always proves to be too much for the person who is chosen to manifest it to the rest of us.  Many thanks to Milos Forman for the wisdom to keep out of the way and allow genius to shine through.  In that sense, ""Amadeus"" is an exercise in humility.  Few films come across as blessings for those who experience them.  ""Amadeus"" is one such film."
"I thought that it would be impossible to make a movie like this one! Peter Schaffer's original play inspired Milos Forman, the great czech film maker, that surprised the world with ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"" (1975). The sublime, almost over-human performance by Frank Murray Abraham (the Mozart enemy and secret admirer, Salieri) is one of the keys for the movie success, mostly to it's depth. The perfect sense of timing by Milos Forman is admirable, he knows when to play wich music. All the scenarios: opera houses, palaces, streets, etc., are details absolutely harmonious! One of this classic secret was that Forman gathered ""the"" team, perfect team work.We can just admire it, laugh, cry, reflect, most of all, listen to it. See it, it's 10/10.Thank you Mr. Forman..."
"When the two worlds of Antonio Salieri and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart collide in Milos Forman's Amadeus, it is anything but a symphony. As the court composer of the Emperor of Austria, all Salieri desires are fame and recognition as a composer; it is all he had wanted his whole life. When he learns that Mozart, whose name he had known as long as he can remember, is going to come to the court to play, Salieri cannot wait to meet the outstanding and righteous man that he knows he must be. However, when Salieri learns that Mozart is a young, crude, and unrefined young man, endowed with all the talent and ability that he ever wanted and strived for, it plants a seed of jealousy that soon grows into bitter resentment and hatred, not only for Mozart, but also towards God. Salieri's desire to get rid of him is seemingly boundless as he plots and schemes for Mozart's demise. It is no wonder why Amadeus won eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, with 5-Star performances by F. Murry Abraham as Antonio Salieri and Tom Hulce as Mozart. Amadeus is an emotionally charged and tragic piece, a story of the life of one of the world's most famous composers, as seen through the eyes of his worst enemy."
"What can I say that hasn't been said? Amadeus is a truly wonderful film, and as it is told from the point of view of an insane, elderly Salieri, I forgive it's historical inaccuracy. What I fail to understand is how the majority of people who watch this film and don't like it can say it's ""stupid how Mozart dies"". They seem to be under the impression that he died of working hard and stress, or just being driven mad. PAY ATTENTION PEOPLE! There are SO MANY scenes of Mozart drinking. There are scenes of him SNEAKING OUT to go drinking. There are scenes of his wife finding bottles littered around the house. Keep in mind that alcohol brewed in Vienna during Mozart's time was pretty potent stuff. History says Mozart died of an ""unknown feverish illness"", but it seems clear to me that the filmmaker was trying desperately to make the viewer see that his vision of Mozart drank himself to death BECAUSE of the stress. Observe Mozart's final hours. His skin, his eyes, his fever. How can the public at large, no matter HOW old you are, not recognize that this movie suggests Mozart dying of cirrhosis of the liver? Therein lies the brilliance of the movie. They never SAY this is the cause. Could it have been poison? Salieri doesn't remember it that way, but then, he could be omitting that detail. More likely it was Mozart's own drinking problem that killed him in this movie. Like so many geniuses, Mozart was his own killer. Legendary talent and fame that burns brightly always accompanies a life that winks out of existence quickly. The message of this movie would then seem to be that Salieri WAS blessed by God, and that Mozart was the cursed one. Salieri was blessed with long life, while Mozart died poor and young. The irony is that Salieri, being a true artist, recognizes that his long life of mediocrity will not- CAN not- measure up to Mozart's legend, despite his short life. Salieri would trade that long life for a short life that guaranteed him people knew his music forever... And in the end, he is forgotten like the rest of us. Is there a villain in this movie? No. There are only two victims, and a great amount of wonderful music and dialogue."
"F. Murray Abraham portrays Salieri, a hard working but mediocre composer driven mad by the arrival of a ``natural'' talent, Mozart (played by Tom Hulce) in a highly political environment.  The movie provides some crucial insights into the motivations of the characters, and shows both a superficial image and reveals deeper truths (e.g. Mozart appears to party all the time, but is actually a very diligent worker). I am uncertain as to the historical accuracy, but this movie (i) was entertaining, (ii) inspired a greater love and knowledge of Mozart's Music, (iii) dramatized the undoing of a great talent by both external forces and his own weaknesses (iv) has great costumes and music and (v) has a great supporting cast."
"'Amadeus' won eight Academy Awards with its highly fictionalized account of the life of 18th-century composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart... The film explores the essence of our strength and weakness, our essay on love, our darker side as human beings... Both Mozart and Salieri were born with unusual talents, but were overcome by emotions of love, faith, hate, pride, rage, repugnance, envy and falseness...F. Murray Abraham gives a tremendous performance as Antonio Salieri, the forgotten composer of Vienna who unfairly compares his own skill to a better man in the field, harboring in his heart a violent and uncontrolled anger, causing the poison of his own malice... Tom Hulce is remarkable as the over-excited genius, with a high-pitched giggle, whose unique music shows a continuous growth in expressive power...Jeffrey Jones gives a delightful performance as the 'musical king' who does not censor things lightly...Elizabeth Berridge is the perplexed and tempted woman who delivers the Court Composer a portfolio filled with her husband's manuscripts, and is horrified in hearing that 'some service deserves service in return.'Christine Ebersole is the young, high-spirited soprano, emotionally disturbed by Mozart's dramatic change...Richard Frank is the Chaplain, at the hospital, who hears Salieri's faults...Roy Dotrice is the menacing figure in a long, gray cape and dark gray hat...Nicholas Kepros is the Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg who seems quite sure that Mozart has sold himself to Vienna...Vincent Schiavelli is Salieri's valet who tries to tempt his master to open the door with a favorite dessert...Cynthia Nixon is the young maid-servant who is invited to go to Mozart's house and offer her services... Roderick Cook is the harsh and highly correct Emperor's Chamberlain who makes certain to a passionate Mozart that a little modesty would suit him better... Charles Kay is the corpulent man, highly conscious of his position as Director of the Opera, who rips out several pages of Mozart's music...Jonathan Moore is the kindly and educated Imperial Librarian who argues that opera is here to ennoble human spirits... Simon Callow is the impresario who asks the enchanted Amadeus to write for him a proper part with a couple of catchy songs, and he will guarantee him a 'luxurious triumph.'Kenneth McMillan is the prosperous merchant who treats his dogs like his own children...One of my favorite sequence is when a bewildered Mozart is received by the Emperor who is practicing a little March of Welcome composed by the illustrious Salieri... After some comments and remarks, Mozart, returns the manuscript back to the Emperor, and sits on the piano to play Salieri's musical composition demonstrating to the Emperor that he already had it in his head 'on one hearing only.' Mozart plays the first half of the march with great precision, then proceeds to modify the written score so that it turns out into a much better march... Filmed in Prague with a joyous music from Mozart's phenomenal repertoire, Milos Forman's 'Amadeus' is a masterpiece of drama intelligent and moving, handsomely filmed, competently directed, extremely well-acted, exquisitely mounted... The script gives a thought-provoking scenario that is clever, believable and interesting..."
"What can you say about this movie's director, Milos Foreman? He is just simply superb at the itemization of complex human nature. The film, ""Amadeus"" is considered to be one of the greatest movies of all time! You would think that any director who lays claim to a film with such a stellar reputation would be at the pinnacle of his professional genius. The fact is, that in Foreman's case, he previously directed another film which has been critically earmarked as perhaps the most spectacular movie ever produced, that motion picture being: ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" Milos Foreman won the academy award for best director in '1975 for ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"", just as he won the academy award for best director in '1984 for ""Amadeus"". Foreman takes a monotonously challenging approach to his films. I am convinced that this world renowned director could build a perfectly designed New York City skyscraper using only a pair of tweezers. This is how detailed Milos Foreman actually is! ""Amadeus"" was a simply remarkable movie which engages in a comprehensive biography of one of the most masterful composers of classical music in the whole history of all creation, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. This movie depicts how Mozart did not even write the notes to his sheet music on script paper, he memorized all of the music which he originated !! That is just simply amazing! Clinically using the adjective, prodigal, for describing Mozart, would merely be a paramount utterance of understatement. The culprit to Mozart's vulgarity was due largely in part to his baroque environment! Mozart's corrupt candor cultivated a tailor made invitation for his spontaneity to allow his personality to open the floodgates for him to maximize his flourishing aggregate potential! The movie ""Amadeus"" purported an intensely vivid clarity for pointing out a great many of Mozart's talented attributes! In a time when Germanic culture carried an assertively chauvinistic aura with the world's paradigm, Mozart was convinced that if he was going to write an unequivocally marvelous opera, that this opera should be composed and expedited in Italian. The English translation for this opera was entitled ""The Marriage of Figaro"". The cerebral complexities to Mozart were simply astounding. The grass root recognition of ideological fervor which prevailed with the hierarchy during the period of nineteenth century Austria was portrayed with a very subtle disposition in this film! The rendition of Mozart's music which was performed by the Dallas symphony, and conducted by Edward Mata, was a compendium of Mozart concertos which I will emphatically categorize as marvelously top notch entertainment. When I was in Austria, while visiting Salzburg, I ate lunch at a restaurant which use to be Mozart's home. The plethora of Mozart artifacts in Salzburg were, to say the least, intellectually sensitizing! This enriching sojourn of mine became a reflective synopsis of how influential Mozart was to the entire spectrum of classical music. As a matter of fact, I became passionately imbued with an aesthetic appreciation for Mozart as a result of watching this film,!! Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart auspiciously revolutionized all of western civilization.The film ""Amadeus"" executes a successfully cogent expertise at illustrating Mozart as an aficionado with an artistic finesse and an unprecedented musical flair!! Winning the academy award for best picture back in 1984, this is just simply the introductory tip of the iceberg in terms of being an indicator of how wonderful this motion picture truly is. If you have not seen ""Amadeus"" yet, make it a point to do so. The acting is great, the cinematography is enlightening, and the directing, by one of the all time directors in the whole history of Hollywood film making, Milos Foreman, is totally sensational!! See this film!! Five Stars!! Perfect Ten!! No Question About It!!"
"Not only did I enjoy watching this movie, but it also stuck with me afterward. In most respects it is well put together. The story if multidimensional and carries the viewer along well. The acting is superb; F. Murray Abraham as Salieri is flawless, Tom Hulce gives a fleshed-out portrait of Mozart's brilliance and his (according to the film) frivolous personality, and Elizabeth Berridge and the other principal actors put in solid performances too. The music works well with the scenes; my only complaint is that some of the opera scenes get a bit long. However, all in all this is an excellent piece of work. It is not historically accurate, but if one keeps that in mind, what harm can it do to appreciate its beauty?"
"A lavish, highly enjoyable production, the film is one of the finest biopics ever made, not just because of excellent production values, or the mystery element about the title person's death, but because it brings more to the depicted section of Mozart's life than just that. The film brings up and dives into deep religious issues and how important such religious beliefs were in the eighteenth century, and also it brings up some ideas about the profane mixed with the sacred. The whole production is wonderfully set to classical music, and it is technically superb in every area, with very good costumes and editing, as well as some fine acting, particularly from by Jeffrey Jones, who is as delightful as ever as Emperor Joseph. Nevertheless the film feels a bit lively in excess at times, and it never quite feels like it is in Vienna with the mixed accents, but still it is a quite a stunning achievement and simply superb entertainment. The film deservedly won 8 Academy Awards including Best Picture. A director's cut of the film was released too, running an extra twenty minutes at no detriment to the film."
"At the tender age of 26, when I still thought no film was complete without a car chase and a big explosion, Amadeus had me hooked. I went to see it multiple times back in 1984 during its initial release, back when the theater was empty whenever it played and before it was nominated by the Academy.This film is an unusual biography, and I often like to compare it with Ed Wood, since both Ed Wood and Salieri were men who gave everything they had to their respective crafts and came up short. Salieri, a contemporary of Mozart, has only one dream - to be a great composer. Predating the prosperity gospel by about two hundred years, Salieri mistakes obsessing with God over his own earthly desires with actual godliness, even being happy when his father - who objects to Salieri's musical interests - chokes to death and leaves Salieri free to pursue his musical dreams. He chalks this up to God's will for his career. Problems begin when Salieri meets a twenty-something Mozart at the court of the Emperor in Vienna, where Salieri is the court composer. Mozart is everything Salieri is not - profane, forward, and a great composer. Salieri starts down the road to insanity as he realizes the childish Mozart has all of the gifts he ever wanted and has been denied. However, Salieri is not an outright failure as was Ed Wood. In many ways he is something worse than a ridiculous failure - he is mediocre, and worse yet, he knows it.Salieri,angry at God for honoring a profane ungrateful boy like Mozart while ignoring his own one desire to be a great composer, swears to destroy Mozart. The strange thing is, as long as Mozart is alive, Salieri is the honored composer, not Mozart, though this just seems to infuriate Salieri even more. Salieri seems to be the only person in Vienna who recognizes Mozart's talent. This just begs the question - why did it never occur to Salieri that being able to recognize something as valuable before anyone else does is a talent in and of itself? After all, in 1975 the second best thing to being Bill Gates would have been to have recognized his genius and invested heavily in his success. But I digress.The cinematography and art direction on this film are outstanding. The visuals start out light and festive, matching Mozart's mood and prospects. As poverty, illness, and the guilt of his father's death close in on Mozart during the second half of the film, the mood and visuals become very dark to match what is happening in Mozart's own life. Highly recommended."
"Now, this is my idea of a movie - spectacle, religion, sex, envy, and some of the most stirring music ever composed.  And it all seems so modern; a bad visit from Mozart's father is awkward in the same way as a bad visit with my own parents!  Here's a film that makes ancient history seem like yesterday, using the same trick employed by all classic films - solid characterization.It's a shame that so many of these actors never did much else, but maybe that's a blessing in disguise because it allows them to embody their characters without other movie associations getting in the audience's way.I was worried that the extended edition would hurt the film's pacing (most extended editions are a bad idea - the material was cut for a reason!).  But in fact, all of the restored scenes are excellent.  I should have expected no less!  Beautiful costumes, beautiful locations, beautiful everything...very fittingly, ""Amadeus"" stands above and apart from the mediocrity."
"I've just acquired a video of ""Amadeus,"" and I have a much greater appreciation for it now than I did when I saw it six years ago. I was filled with the urge to see it after watching ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" repeatedly, which stars Tom Hulce as the voice of Quasimodo. Yet, as I watched ""Amadeus,"" though Tom Hulce was exceptional as Mozart, it was F. Murray Abraham with whom I was most impressed. He is PERFECT as Salieri, and he does one of the best acting jobs I have ever seen in my life in this part. He plays his character in such a real and believable way that I was completely taken in by him. Also, so great is his talent, that it took me about five times of watching the movie all the way through (and checking the credits!) to realize that it was the same actor playing ""Old Salieri"" and ""Middle-aged Salieri"" throughout the movie. I recommend that you see this movie just of Abraham alone, though the entire thing is a masterpiece. I went out and bought a cd of Mozart's Requiem Mass after seeing it just twice! Overall, this movie is intriguing and entertaining, and the actors are perfect. No one could have played Mozart better than Tom Hulce, and I don't think I have to mention how amazing F. Murray Abraham is as Salieri again. I give it a 10/10. Simply fantastic."
"Amadeus presents a heavily fictionalized, speculative portrayal of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's last years, focusing powerfully on his relationship with Italian composer Anthony Saliere, and Mozart's wife, Constanzia. My review is based on first seeing the theatrical release in the theater during its first run, and then viewing the director's cut twice. In my opinion, the director's cut is a much better film, though the theatrical release would still earn an 8 from me. Do not approach this movie looking for some objective presentation of historic fact. Do not go into this film expecting to see a tribute to one of the world's greatest composers. Do not see Amadeus in order to understand the workings of musical genius. Inasmuch as all of these are incomprehensible - probably as much to those who lived them as they are today - Amadeus fails to achieve any of these laudable goals. What is does achieve - and quite well - is the blending of elements of Mozart's personality, aspects of his historical context, and an ingenious plot which is spelled out in a very clever narrative style. The truth you get out of Amadeus - as with most good historical fiction films and novels, is the truth of the feeling of a particular time and place.Amadeus immerses its audience in Europe's 18th century, but has just enough anachronism in its script to prevent losing its audience there. Mozart is a young prodigy who struggles with his own ego, over-sensitivity, arrogance, and self-destructiveness against a world which does not really know what to make of him. Salieri (Abraham) is his most ardent fan and admirer, but harbors a deep personal and professional jealousy, as well as an overwhelming self-centered guilt, and an even deeper conviction that his own perceived inadequacies reflect on his relationship to his creator. The third character, much better developed in the director's cut than in previous versions, is Mozart's wife Constanzia (Berridge) - seemingly the only fully rational and practical person among the principal roles. The film narrates the twists and turns of fate - the intrigues and folklore - which, even today tend to crowd out the facts of this part of Mozart's life. Hulce, playing Mozart in what is easily his greatest performance to date, utters a couple of highly anachronistic and off-color remarks in the course of the film. ISince I do not hold historical FICTION to some arbitrary standard of authenticity, I can say that my reaction to these was probably exactly as they were intended: (1) Either Mozart was so creatively explosive that he occasionally happened upon 20th century phraseology through sheer coincidence and/or (2) We are supposed to find these phrases a little shocking and they are used as plot devices to give the film a sense of surreality. Either way, the films works very well as a work of art and a good story, and what some describe as problems of authenticity are, to my mind, nothing more than artistic license. Most movies are not meant to be encyclopedic recitations of 'what really happened'. Keep that in mind before you commit to watching this. The only danger with regard to this film is that it is SO compellingly portrayed that some people are likely to walk away from it believing that this REALLY is what happened. F. Murray Abraham, who almost always does well, exceeds himself in this film, and well deserved his Oscar. Hulce is remarkable and the supporting cast are easily up to the task. The directing is subtle enough to be somewhat refreshingly unnoticeable, and the script and editing are excellent (at least in the director's cut). Very little can be said about the use of period music and costume which has not been said in the numerous awards and the high praise received from critics. This is a great film. Highly recommended for adults of any age."
"As of this writing, I have about 90 reviews on IMDb. I'd only began submitting reviews a few years ago, so the films I'd seen in the past were never reviewed by me. I thought I'd take the time now to give a quick review of the 10/10 films I'd seen in my life.First one up is ""Amadeus,"" and to me, the best film ever made. It's the movie I compare all others to, including classics like ""The Godfather,"" ""Citizen Kane,"" and ""Schindler's List.""""Amadeus"" has it all - excellent acting, excellent cinematography, excellent costume design, excellent music production, excellent set design, perfect combination of comedy and tragedy, and tons and tons of classic, memorable lines, especially those delivered by Salieri. I saw this movie in the theatres when it first came out. I was 18 years old and it made me fall in love with classical music. Director Milos Forman is truly a wonder, given that he's helmed quite a few films that made my top 25 list - ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and ""Ragtime."" How fitting it should be, then, that my favourite song of all time appears in one of his films, ""Hair."" Coincidence? I think not. The man's a genius, plain and simple. He's also caused me to structure some of my screenplays and novels based on ""Ragtime."" Talk about influential."
"Wow. I've just read dozens of pages of rave reviews about how this movie was awesome, the best, amazing, and yes, even incredible. Are you serious? Most likely this is because they were no doubt impressed by the score which featured masterworks by one of the greatest musical geniuses in all of history. Or, perhaps this was their first exposure to music of this caliber.But to anyone who knows the real historic truth about Mozart, these raving positive reviews are the equivalent of these uniformed reviewers wearing a t-shirt that says in big bold letters: ""I know absolutely nothing about music history"".Of course, any complete novice of classical music would be impressed by a totally fictional and insulting movie about Mozart simply because of the music. And the obvious fact, they don't realize that what they are watching is pure fiction, ignorant to that it is revisionist history, and to anyone who knows who Mozart really was, an offensive insult. In reality it's a film that exploits Mozart's music in order to win over the uninformed, and then proceeds to fill their heads with a mockery of who the man really was. The result is the masses, who know nothing about Mozart, go away impressed by his music but believing a fictional mockery as the truth. It uses his creative works to perpetuate a mockery of the genius who composed them. Sad, really sad."
"I am sure that casting Tom Hulce as Mozart was a great risk, but unfortunately that was the main thing that kept me from enjoying this movie. It wasn't all Hulce's fault, since there was a decision to have him insert an exceedingly irritating cackle at pretty much random points. Whoever dreamed that up must have really liked the idea, since there is one final cackle that closes the movie after all of the end credits have run. Hulce's attempts to act as an orchestra conductor were on a par with what you would expect from some untutored middle school student, what with gesticulations that mainly just kept the beat. Mozart was a musical genius who challenged the hidebound opinions of the times as to what was deemed acceptable. In that he is little different from early rock-and-roll stars. As presented he was a young, brash, free spirit (so at least the audience was spared the ponderous, agonized artist trope) with few endearing qualities. Granted, there seems to have been a large disparity between Mozart the person and his incredible music, but I cannot believe that he was quite the fool as what is seen here; the personality set forth was not credible to me. If only we had a time machine.There are some good things, like a couple of good performances. F. Murry Abraham is a standout in his subtle portrayal of Antonio Salieri. In this movie Salieri is a tragic figure. He was a popular and respected musician in the court of Emperor Joseph II. Beethoven and Schubert were among his students and I think Salieri gets somewhat of a bum rap in this movie. Solieri's torture was to recognize the difference between his talents and the pure genius of Mozart causing a serious conflict between jealousy and awe. I have seen this scenario played out in the workplace and it would have worked out for the best if the inferior party had just accepted that he was out-gunned; the results were unfortunate, as with Salieri. I thought that Jeffery Jones was particularly effective as Emperor Joseph II. He could walk the fine line between haughtiness and genuine feeling with aplomb.The staging of the opera segments is brilliant. In fact a movie with just extended opera segments, so presented, would be a treasure. As appropriate, Mozart's music plays a central role. But they never let it play for any decent length of time. Particularly irritating was the interruption of the staging of the final scene of ""The marriage of Figaro"" with a voice-over from Salieri. Couldn't they at least spare a few minutes to let the audience appreciate one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever written? If that piece does not convince anyone of Mozart's genius, then there is no hope that that appreciation will ever be sparked. At least they had enough sense not to interrupt the Lacrimosa from Mozart's Requiem played over his burial. The brief scenes from ""The Magic Flute"" left me wanting more--the translation into English for those scenes was clever.The production is lavish and a delight to watch. The film deserved its Oscar for costume design--the costumes must have been a major expense. The filming is first rate with sets and architecture that created (at least for me) a feel for what 18th century Vienna must have been like. Some scenes were filmed in an opera house where Mozart himself conducted."
"I saw Amadeus at the Cambridge Film festival. I was told it was the story of Mozart's life, was critically acclaimed and the pinnacle of the festival. How much was I disappointed, often irritated and by the end I felt thoroughly used and exploited by what I can only describe as a terrible, terrible film. But why? Well I was quite excited by the thought of a film about one of the greatest composers and musicians of all time, the potential to create really powerful film with some emotional and awe inspiring scenes accompanied by his most famous and rousing music was tremendous and, seemingly, obvious. Instead Amadeus chose to focus on how irritating Mozart the man was, and featured a few uninspiring scenes demonstrating his genius in composition. Good Will Hunting managed to make maths exciting, but Amadeus was given the most moving medium of all, Music, by one of the most incredible musicians who ever lived, and they made it more boring than dry paint that's been dry for a very long time.For such a critically acclaimed film I was expecting certain things. First was good music, but this was a taken. It was about Mozart, of course the music was good, it was Mozart. All they needed was Mozart's greatest hits playing in the background to be good! So I give it 0 points for the score, you want good classical music then buy the CD.  I would say that Fahrid Murray Abraham was very good as the narrator and main character, putting in solid performance. As far as the other acting is concerned the mixture of accents from Shakespearean English to Italian, German and inevitably American never related to the actual nationality of the character was enough for me to hate every performance, if I hear Elizabeth Berridge say Volfey in a German\American accent once more I consider suing for mental aggravation.You want good classical music with a complex story and impressive cinematography then watch 2001 A Space Odyssey. If you want the story of a flawed but fantastic composer then get Shine out on video, you wont be disappointed. If you prefer your musical period drama documentaries full of irritating actors, pretty costumes, tedious storylines and bits of opera then do watch this, and if you would prefer to while away your time for three mind numbingly boring hours then check out the directors cut. Amadeus, you owe me £5 and three hours of my life, I wont forgive you until I get them back. dan"
"Tom Hulce as Mozart basically ruins the film with his relentless mugging; he was only chosen because of his cackling laugh.The movie has lavish set designs and costumes, but the underlying hatred of Italians makes the film mean-spirited. In fact, ask yourself why the film-makers wanted to disrespect the Italians so vehemently. Other mistakes include the casting of Lez Berridge, who annoyingly refers to 'Wolfgang Mozart' as ""Volfie"", her Brooklyn accent in tow-- make that her Coney Island accent.Worth tuning in to see a perfect performance by Murry Abrahum playing the Italian musical genius, Antonio Salieri."
"Very good adaptation about the intense confrontation among composers , including impressive soundtrack , gorgeous sets , glamorous billowy gowns , with magnificent scenario for the 18th century Europe . The film is an intense drama added with historic elements and formidable performances . The incredible story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in 18th Century Vienna , told by his peer and secret rival Antonio Salieri - now confined to an insane asylum . They have a clash of wills , as Mozart is a vulgar , immature , licentious composer with a hyena laugh , and Salieri , the composer of court Jose II of Austria , Jeffrey Jones , schemes his tormentor's destruction . F.Murray Abraham's Salieri is a mediocre composer who desires greatness but is tortured himself by jealous , sorrow and envy , though admiring the greatest composer he has ever heard . His worst attacks of angst happen when he comes into contact with Tom Hulce's Mozart . Mozart is so awful , so much crass vulgarian who , despite his gifts remains unaffected and delighted by the beauty he composes while irking the hell out of everyone around him . Several real , or at least apocryphal, events from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's life were incorporated into the screenplay, including the interlude between the child Mozart and Marie Antionette . We are very interested in following developments and alternatively to their horrifying ending . It's a stunning film full of superb music , literate , wit and an immensely dramatic fire . The picture contains some striking visual images , lavish setting with enormous production design by Patrizia Von Brandenstein , terrific period piece with realistic scenario for the XVIII century filmed on location in Prague, besides nifty brilliant costumes . In fact , Prague , Milos Forman's native city, was ideal as a stand-in for Vienna , as modern television antennas, plastic and asphalt had rarely been introduced under Communist rule . This is an agreeable rendition by playwright Peter Shaffer of his play about the dramatic rivalry among two great composers . Tom Hulce delivers a stunning portrayal, a boorish musician kissed with genius , sometimes a little bit exaggerated, of the popular composer whose music is become immortal. Hulce expresses musical genius and a first class finger-matching . Tom Hulce practiced four hours a day at the piano to appear convincing . Salieri is performed in masterly style throughout by F. Murray Abraham , winning deservedly one of the movie's Oscars , conveying inner feeling by looks , movements and gestures .Evocative and colorful cinematography by Miroslav Ondricek . Entire film was shot with natural light , in order to get the proper diffusion of light for some scenes, it was covered windows from the outside with tracing paper . Terrific musical score by John Strauss with orchestra directed by Neville Marriner , as musical conductor of Mozart's music has a glorious sweep ; there are played the followings Mozart's plays : Concert nº 27 for pianoforte and orchestra in Flat Major , Ave Verum Corpus , Concert for clarinet and orchestra number 39 , number 40 and number 41 , Requiem ; furthermore , opera representations : Figaro's weddings , The magic flute , Don Giovanni ; in fact , the performance of ""Don Giovanni"" in the movie was filmed on the same stage where the opera first appeared . Sets and costumes for the operatic productions were based on sketches of the original costumes and sets used when the operas premiered . The motion picture was lavishly produced by Saul Zaentz and excellently directed by Milos Forman (Valmont, Ragtime ,Hair , Someone flow the Cucko nest , Larry Flint) ; it won eight Adamy Award as main actor , adapted screenplay , art direction , set decoration , make-up , costume , director and picture . In addition , it achieved several prizes , such as : Golden Globes , L.A. Films Critics , and French Cesar , among others . Devotees of the music will appeal this film which is a fine tribute to classical music ."
"I know I thought highly of this movie in the past, I remember that our music teacher in school actually recommended to see it. But now that I recently watched it again, I was gravely disappointed by it.Basically none of the story is historically (the time and circumstances of his death; the relationship between Salieri and Mozart; the relationship between Mozart and his father; the origin of Constanze; Mozart as a drunkard) or musically (most music one hears is clearly recorded using modern instruments; how the conducting is portrayed; how Mozart ""dictates"" the music to Salieri) true, some of the set decoration and costuming was awful (modern pool table in a home in 1791; obvious electrical candles in quite a few scenes; modern fabrics were used in the opera scenes). If one finds the characters as laid out in the script believable (which I don't) one could probably find the acting to be outstanding, but since I don't believe the story (any more), I cannot subscribe to that any more, either.What remains is the powerful use of some of Mozart's greatest music, for that I agree with Neville Marriner who has supposedly said that he was happy to see this movie built around the music and not vice versa. This still raises the film above the average level."
"Mozart is my favorite composer, I love his music, all of it - his symphonies, concertos, operas, Requiem, you named it. I've read many books about him; I try not to miss any concert where his music is performed. I know that ""Amadeus"" the movie is not exactly his biography, and his relationship with Antonio Salieri, with his father Leopold, with his wife Constanze Weber, with the Emperor Joseph II and with the court musicians in Vienna of 18th century, might not have been exactly like it was shown in the movie, and Mozart himself might not have laughed as Hulce did but I LOVE the movie. I've seen it many times and I still love it. It is about a conflict between a genius for whom to create was as easy as to breath, and a talent that realized that no matter how he tried, he can not be a genius. It is very easy to admire a genius from the distance; it is unbearable to be next to him and to realize that you never will reach the same heights. Admiration, contempt, hatred, denial, self-hatred and above all of these ""monsters with green eyes"" -divine music that will live forever, music oblivious to the dark passions, music that makes us feel the presence of perfection and harmony...Once again, ""Amadeus"" is not a biography, at least I don't see it as such. It is a work of fiction and a wonderful film that did not make me see a real Salieri as a villain. Having read many materials about Mozart and his time, and having listened to the music from his epoch, I have a respect for Salieri and his music which is quite charming.Amadeus - beloved of Gods and taken by them too early because those whom they love die young."
"Spoilers herein.Sometimes things just come together for no apparent reason. And when they do, they are either of the Mozart type or Salieri types. Here's how to tell in films: no chances are taken -- no experiments are made -- everything is extremely competent, but in following rules established by others.That's this film, and it is ironic that it is its own damnation. It is unelaborate, too few notes. Each character can be fully described in one sentence. Every situation as well.Mozart's genius was in creating depth in the music -- music which commented on itself by elaborating itself. The phrases were novel, but tricky -- after hearing them you believed you knew them all along but were wiser because of it. Not so this film, which is lush but unrewarding.So why is it well-received? Because it has costumes, is easy to read, has pleasant music. And -- I believe -- because it has the required self-referential `play with the play.'"
"""Amadeus"" is an insulting, juvenile, historically-inaccurate comedy sketch stretched to two and-a-half hours. It does not reveal the true character of Mozart or shed light on his musical brilliance- it does not even try. The movie plays like a practical joke, a humorous hypothetical on what might have been, but almost certainly wasn't.First, our story is told through the eyes of rival composer Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), who is little more than a narrator/stooge for the audience to laugh at while identifying with the rogue genius of Mozart. This is the movie's first stunt, and it only gets more manipulative from there. We are introduced to Mozart as a skirt-chasing, irreverent, giggling idiot, while of course the men in authority and powdered wigs stand around looking shocked at his behavior. Outrageous...This is a cheat that director Milos Forman has been using for years: the misunderstood, irresponsible genius who is always bucking the system and stirring up controversy, but whose actions are justified by his sex drive and/or having one woman that loves him. Adultery and a steady girlfriend do not make up for being a jackass, but Forman applied the same formula here as he did in ""Man On The Moon"" and ""The People Vs. Larry Flynt."" It still doesn't work.Tom Hulce's portrayal of Mozart as a giggling manchild- to assure the audience he wasn't as dry or stodgy as we might imagine- backfires completely. He's so over-the-top ridiculous I wound up having less respect for Mozart AFTER the movie than I did before. Of course, the Mozart portrayed in the film has little or nothing to do with the actual man.Mozart was not- by any account- a childlike fool, nor did he write perfect manuscripts of music already composed in his head. Mozart and Salieri- who might have experienced a natural rivalry- were known to be good friends, and Salieri had no part in Mozart's death from natural causes. But then ""Amadeus"" seems to lose some of its spark without a bad-guy antagonist whose only goal is the destruction of our hero.Finally, while I can't hold awards against a film, I cannot for the life of me understand why F. Murray Abraham- the film's lead actor- was nominated in the Best Supporting Actor category, and the fact that this film won both Best Picture and Best Director is a scandal. Don't waste your time on ""Amadeus."" Listen to some of Mozart's timeless music and you will know everything about the man there is to know.GRADE: D"
"Few films create such a lasting impact as ""Amadeus."" Although it may not be as well-recognized as some other classics, those ""in the know"" have been privy to one of the great films of the 20th century. Its Director's Cut re-release a few years ago re-established it as a classic, and enticed many new viewers.Personally, having been subjected to this film years ago, watching the Director's Cut is a delight, because it seems to flow even better now, even with an extra twenty minutes of runtime.The film begins with the composer Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) telling his story (and Mozart's) to a priest (Simon Callow). Antonio feels personally responsible for Mozart's early death, and finally - after years of silence - spills his beans.The flashbacks (intercut with scenes of Salieri reciting the story from memory) show us the infantile and juvenile Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (played by ""Animal House's"" Tom Hulce) and his domination of musical composure in Vienna, where he was the subject of jealousy from Salieri, whose lifelong dream was to be half as great as Mozart.The performances are wonderful - Hulce perfectly embodies the Mozart many of us weren't aware existed - the troubled, disrespectful and hyper-active man-child. Today, historians claim Mozart probably suffered from attention disorders like ADD. Whatever the reason for his behavior, Hulce never lets up on the believability.Even more impressive is F. Murray Abraham as Salieri. It is really he who carries the film on his shoulders and is the vital link to Mozart. I personally think it was a brilliant decision by Peter Shaffer (playwrite and scriptwriter) to convey the story through the eyes of another man close to Mozart, rather than Mozart himself. It's far more effective than a simple narrative, which would have detracted from the effortless intrigue of this movie. (Once you start watching, you're hooked - even though it's three hours long on the Director's Cut, it's over in what feels like less than half that long.) Milos Forman has been responsible for some wonderful films throughout his career (other highlights include ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"") but in my opinion, from a directorial standpoint, this is probably his strongest. ""Cuckoos' Nest"" may have had deeper themes and drawn greater parallels between characters and events and symbolism, but ""Amadeus"" doesn't need to be complicated, and it isn't. At heart it is the story of a brilliant composer and the man whose jealousy destroyed them both. This should be seen by everyone at least once - because once you see it, you'll come back for seconds."
"AMADEUS: DIRECTOR'S CUT Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Sound format: Dolby DigitalMany years after the death of Mozart (Tom Hulce), the aged and embittered court composer Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) relates to a disbelieving priest the story of his obsession with Mozart's musical genius and how it led to jealousy, betrayal, and possibly even murder...Sumptuous evocation of a time and place, using Mozart's glorious music both to propel the story and underline the emotional dynamics of Peter Shaffer's extraordinary script. Based on his well-received stage play, and completely reworked for the screen, AMADEUS (1984) - and its updated version, reviewed here as AMADEUS: DIRECTOR'S CUT, released in 2001 - portrays Mozart's world as a romantic marriage of Royal palaces and candle-lit garrets, populated by eccentric emperors and their devious, toadying lackeys. The composer himself is played by Hulce as a spoiled, egotistical brat who indulges his passion for earthly pleasures with all the enthusiasm he brings to his musical compositions. But the film is anchored by Abraham in an Oscar-winning turn as Mozart's nemesis Salieri, consumed by envy and hatred whilst simultaneously awed by his rival's genius, the genius which Salieri had wished for himself, only to be denied by a mischievous God. The scenes in his asylum cell - where the elder Salieri confesses his 'crime' to a naive priest (Richard Frank) - are a tour de force, played with an intensity that simply burns up the screen. Beautifully designed and photographed, and bolstered by a magnificent supporting cast (including Jeffrey Jones, Simon Callow and Kenneth McMillan in a role completely excised from the original theatrical print), the movie unfolds like an operatic melodrama which builds to a shattering climax, as the two central characters reach an understanding (of sorts) during the writing of Mozart's 'Requiem', only to be divided forever by unexpected tragedy. A masterpiece.The director's cut runs 180 minutes (the original theatrical version ran 160m) and reinstates various bits and pieces which help to clarify a number of crucial plot developments (the antagonism between Salieri and Mozart's wife is more fully explained, for example). Incredibly, the MPAA gave the film an R-rating for a brief sequence in which a female character bares her breasts to the camera! There's nothing here which warrants anything more than a PG-13.NB. The original version was released theatrically in 35mm and 70mm editions, featuring a 6-track Dolby Stereo soundtrack."
"Yes, Amadeus is funny, sad, musical, romantic, and even sexy; but its real value (IMHO) lies in what we can learn from it about the creative temperament. Great artists (sadly) usually ARE impulsive, hyper-sensitive, self-indulgent, non-conformists who are often also self- destructive. Amadeus can easily be viewed as a tragic-comic essay on the artistic personality in general. It was this focus that made it such a valuable learning experience for me. It will remain on my personal top ten list of rewarding film experiences."
"After recently purchasing the Director's Cut & viewing the film with the 20-plus minutes of added scenes, I really appreciate the character of Stanzi so much more. In the original theatrical & D.V.D. release, I believe that many people claimed that Stanzi's character really lacked depth, where as all of the other performances were great. In the newly released Director's Cut, there are a few scenes (most notably the Stanzi-Salieri seduction sequence) that add such a great deal of depth to the Stanzi character. For example, her distant behavior/bitterness towards Salieri (at the end of the film), her protection of her husband & his well-being, her humanity as a woman, etc. are so much more easily understood in this version. In the original theatrical/D.V.D. release not much was presented about her character; audiences felt that this was due to actress Elizabeth Berridge's shortcomings as a performer, when I feel that it was more of a lack of her character in the screenplay & some unfortunate cuts in the editing process. Bottom line: This could be considered the ""Stanzi Edition"" as she shines in her supporting role & brings so much more to the film than she ever had before... 9/10"
"With all its colorful and dazzling visual and audio flare, Amadeus is one for the ages. But I never really connected to the characters, and that's where it fails for me.Winning 8 Oscars in 1985 and numerous other accolades, it's safe to say Amadeus is one of the more beloved films of the 80's. It also comes from the great director behind One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Miles Forman. But what Amadeus lacks is subtly. I understand a film about grand-scale music and opera's needs to have a unique identity, but I found Tom Hulce's eccentric title role-performance to lack the human touch.Of course, Amadeus isn't strictly about Mozart himself, it deals with his ""rivalry"" with Italian composer, Antonio Salieri and the various trials and tribulations of Mozart's wish to display his talents to the world and particularly, the Roman Emperor. These events are told in flashbacks by Salieri as he was recently committed to an Insane Asylum after attempted suicide. As far as we know, most of the events of the film are highly fictionalized or exaggerated. Normally, I don't mind such a choice in storytelling, but it seemed to bother me this time around.What didn't bother me, however, was the performance of F. Murray Abraham as Salieri. Covering decades, Abraham brings a totally different vibe to both the old and younger versions of Salieri, and both work extremely well. It's also worth noting that his character isn't all that likable on paper, but he brings the grounded humanity, especially in his jealousy for Mozart, that's missing from the rest of the film.Another thing Amadeus has going for it is the glorious music used and conducted for the film. Surely, most of the tunes are genius-ly written by the original composers, but the overall sound quality and editing is brilliant. Putting character dialogue aside, merely listening to this film is a joy.I may be in the minority here, but to me, a film must do more than just sound great, it has to move me emotionally in one way or another. The made up story has its fascinating moments, but it gets old after a while. As does the over-the-top performance from Hulce. Sure, a wonderful soundtrack and Abraham's performance are impressive, but it's not enough to get this to a positive review for me.+Abraham+Music-Hulce-Characters lack humanity-A tad long5.8/10"
"Extraordinary! On the page it looked nothing! The beginning simple, almost comic. Just a pulse. And then, suddenly, high above it, beautiful music. A single note, hanging there, unwavering. Until a clarinet took it over, sweetened it into a phrase of such delight! This was no composition by a performing monkey! This was a music I had never heard. Filled with such longing, such unfulfillable longing. It seemed to me that I was hearing the voice of God. Director Milos Forman's Best Picture winning drama was indeed a masterpiece. Based on Peter Shaffer's extravagant 1980 Broadway play with the same name. The film tells a fictionalized biography of tortured genius and Viennese child prodigy Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce). Also, the story was presented in a way that was very unique at the time. It was through the eyes of fellow jealous composer Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) who finds the deeply crude and childish behavior of Mozart, unworthy of such praise. Driven by his attempt to outshine Mozart, Salieri must find a way to gain the audience of the Austrian Aristocrats, before it's too late. Without spoiling the movie, too much, a lot of people had complain that this movie wasn't historical accuracy. In my opinion, a lot of this criticize wasn't needed. To the film credit, Amadeus never claims to be a true story. It's normal for films like this, to sometimes diverge from historical facts in order to explore more fundamental and universal human issues and to achieve a dramatic effect. Yet, the film had more fact than fiction than most people are willing to taken. It did a lot of homework to get, as accuracy as possible. So, when I hear, some of the main complains that the critics point out about the film. I had to question, their short-temper justice. I felt like they were misinform. Many of the so-call historical inaccuracies were somewhat true. It's true that Antonio Salieri later claims he killed Mozart. Even Mozart toward the end of his life, swears that he's believe that he been poison, but in terms of Salieri doing it; its indeed historical fiction; due to the fact that most historians dismissed his mad ravings with that of a person whom clearly had his sanity deteriorated & the fact that Mozart fell ill while in Prague on Sept 6. 1791 where Salieri was clearly not there. Another claim, these critics spoke of, is how the film, portray a masked man wanting to commissioned a requiem from him in order to steal his work. In truth, it was very likely at the time for people to anonymously commissioned requiems from famous composers and pass them as them, off; but there was no reason why Salieri needed to. After all, his music was a lot more popular at the time, than Mozart. It wasn't, because Mozart was lazy. It was, because he was a fading child star, who had drug problems which both historians and film critics fail to notice that kept him working. I thought that Tom Hulce's immature performance as Mozart was very accuracy as it was very well documented that the composer had those characteristic traits even if it's a little exaggerated. However, the ever-present, idiotic giggle does get a little too annoying at times. About the fact that Salieri and Mozart were fighting for certain imperial jobs, it was true, but the reason why Mozart was never given a position on the emperor's courts, wasn't, because Salieri's envy of Mozart, but the fact, that Mozart's music doesn't sound typical 'Galant' & he wasn't noble. There was no reason why Salieri really needed to steal his work, as he was rich enough, and Mozart's work was a little too controversial at the time for basing works on Austrian's past banned materials and not being tradition. About Mozart's constant embarrassment of Salieri, such as seducing Salieri's lover, Catarina Cavalieri (Christine Ebersole). There is no evidence that Mozart slept with her. In reality, it is very likely that Salieri slept with Catarina, as it was generally known, at the time, that she was his mistress, and if they were still together years after 'The Abduction from the Seraglio'. If anything, Mozart and Salieri were, if not best of friends, at least on peaceable terms with one another, when it comes to sexual and musical conquest. He wasn't a saint at all. He even educated Mozart's younger son Franz Xaver Mozart, after the composer death. While, yes it's true that Mozart's work outlive, Salieri. It wasn't because Mozart work was better than Salieri. It was, because German nationalism began to take shape in Vienna with the birth of Romantic nationalism during the Napoleonic Wars. Italians were often view, as scapegoat of the war since Napoleon was one; thus Italian culture like it's music was somewhat banned from most European cultures during the mid19th century. This short ban, cause hits like Salieri to be nearly forgotten. It wasn't until, the late 20th century that most of Salieri's work was reintroduce into western culture with this film. The film was well-received by both critics and audiences alike with its lavish set and period costume design, music, visuals, and its acting. If the film had any faults, it would be the fact that the movie has pacing problems. It's way too damn long. 2h 40min is too much. It could had been cut down. Ultimately, the 1984 awards were monopolized by Amadeus with eight wins: Best Picture, Best Actor (F. Murray Abraham), Best Director, Best Screenplay Adaptation, Best Art/Set Direction, Best Sound, Best Costume Design, and Best Makeup. It became the 7th film in Oscar history to win eight Oscars. Overall: It's visually interesting, has dramatic intrigue acting from F. Murray Abraham, hilarious comedy, and introduced people to a part of history that was phenomenally fascinating and surprising, mostly true. I highly recommended this film."
"Amadeus (1984)A million reviews have been written about this deserving movie--and the big points are good ones. And debatable. One, the play was better. Maybe. The play couldn't use cinematic tricks for its effects, but the movie really took it all much further in movie terms. It's a movie, not an adapted play.Two, it's inaccurate. Yes. Of course. It's a dramatized movie based on an historic figure. The truths are plenty--the boy genius, the patronage, the music scene in general. The fictions are worth noting, mainly that Salieri didn't kill Mozart (there is zero evidence of this, just chatter). Salieri didn't transcribe Mozart's final Requiem at his death bed. And Mozart's wife didn't sound like a ditzy American. Of course. Three, the operas are staged in contemporary terms, like dry ice effects. The venues are appropriate, and in fact, Mozart's time is not that far from ours, not in the larger picture.Speaking of venues, the whole city of Vienna looks terrific--because it's actually Prague. Go to Prague now and it'll have the same effect, though without the gray severity. Yes, Mozart was buried in a common grave. Yes he died too young from still uncertain causes (see Wikipedia for a full rundown of likely options). And yes, he was pretty innovative and radical. And if not as silly as Tom Hulce's interpretation, still a renegade socially and musically.Is it a good movie? Yes, a great movie. Who won't like it? Well, people with an aversion for historical dramas might, but even here, it zooms with such crazy, fun, funny energy, I don't know why it wouldn't just suck people in. Eventually though there are short scenes that are basically straight opera, with some continuing story along the sidelines. If you hate hate opera, you might have to just marvel at the sets and crazy crowds.There isn't a bad actor here, or a bad moment, really. And the music, the music! It's wonderful. The performances, take note, are by the high water mark of Mozart performances in the 20th Century--Sir Neville Mariner leading his famed orchestra. Likewise, the opera productions are by one of the great talents of the era, Twyla Tharp. The director Milos Forman has a short resume but it's impressive, including ""Hair"" as a kind of precursor and ""One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest"" as proof of some kind of higher ability. (Forman hasn't always been on target, though, notably with his highly polished but pushy and almost abusive ""Goya's Ghosts,"" which has a similar structure to ""Amadeus,"" building a large world around a true rebel artist.)Anyway, a marvelous movie, a truly lovely experience, beautifully filmed, intensely envisioned, and acted with aplomb (F. Murray Abraham is a wonder as Salieri, young and old). And it is layered with some of the most emphatic and resolved music ever written."
"How awesome is this movie? It's a visual feast for the eyes, a hilarious comedic effort, with the backdrop to one of the most intriguing plots of all time. In that, 'Amadeus' is a very rare film. A film that contains everything that is enjoyable about watching movies, yet is unlike any movie I've ever seen.The plot? Well, the website sums it up as ' The incredible story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, told in flashback mode by Antonio Salieri - now confined to an insane asylum.' But the story is as much about Mozart (played by Tom Hulce in a career defining performance) as it is about his jealous counterpart, Salieri (A much deserved Best Actor performance by F. Murray Abraham.) The root of his jealously? Mozart's musical talent, which speaks for itself. Salieri can't come to grips as to how this young man, who acts with immense immaturity, has been gifted this extraordinary talent. It's a story every human being should be able to relate to. I mean, who hasn't been envious one time or another? That's what a great film does, takes a richly exotic scenario and applies real world issues to the plot.See this movie if you haven't, I personally guarantee you will be pleased. I know I was. This film deserved every Oscar it was a given (all 8.)"
"I have seen the original version of ""Amedeus"" 6 times and no doubt, it is and always will be a deservedly crowned masterpiece and Best Picture. While I agree with that 100% , I've always had this feeling that there could or should have been more to it. Not because the original was cut by 20 minutes but because it seemed to have more focus on the absurdity of W. Amedues Mozart himself. Yes,he's the title character,but the point of view of the story is told by Salieri and it seems,aside from his aged version and the times we see his young self on screen,in the original his story of his disillusionment with God seems too quick. In this director's version,we find out more than we had before about this. Scenes of him quietly praying but at the same time crying out to God to help him have as great a gift as Mozart.Every failure and snub he receives in his life,from the arrival of the young genius culminates in his declaring God his enemy and burning the Holy Cross in the fireplace. The new scenes help build it to a better climax on that note. Along with this the expanded story of when Mozrt's wife secretly visits Salieri to show her husband's work to him,to gain a paid teaching post. This leads to the deleted section of Salieri telling her to ""come back in the evening"" , for illicit purposes. Once she later arrives and removes her top garment exposing herself,for whatever reason,he decides to instead have her shown out the door. I'm assuming out of his own sense of decency,he decided not to go through with it. It's Mozart he wants to punish ,not her. Even though he has. Lastly,there's also the funny scenes with Mozart trying to instruct a nervous young girl while her family and dogs make constant noise. It's something that causes him to storm out and feel indignant at having to put up with something like this. It adds only a little to the overall story. With the film expanded to 3 hours,again,I feel I saw a much more complete storyline,with both Salieri & Mozrt represented equally on screen. ....but whether in it's original form or this version,there's no way I'd ever rate ""Amedeus"" less than 10 stars. That'd be like telling Mozart his music has ""too many notes"",so...well,there it is. {END}"
"I'm writing this more than anything as a response to the comments about Tom Hulce's accent, the use of English, etc.1. As was already mentioned by another post, the English is used every time the characters ""should"" be speaking German, and so it was done in the songs as well.2. As for the accent, I don't see why this is such an issue. The American accent is a dialect of English spoken in North America, granted. But who cares? That doesn't make Mozart sound any less European. With an English accent, I argue that he'd sound no more Austrian. It's well-known that the characters in this movie, although all speaking German, should represent a huge variety of dialects and accents, not least of which would be Salieri's, who, lest we forget, was an Italian.Other than that, I think the film is outstanding. Yes, I realize there are plenty of historical inaccuracies, but why is that a problem? It isn't a history presentation, it's a movie."
"I adore classical music, and Mozart is one of my favourite composers. When I came across Amadeus in my local charity shop, I knew I had to buy it. I watched it, and I loved it from start to finish. It is true it is not necessarily a true depiction of Mozart's life, but I was so blown away by the quality of the acting, sets, costumes and music that I forgot about that. The film is just gorgeous to look at, Vienna in the film (Prague in real life) looks beautiful, but the sets and costumes are colourful and lavish. The music is utterly majestic, from the Marriage of Figaro, Queen of the Night(brilliantly sung in what is one of the most difficult colouratura arias ever), Requiem in D minor to Don Giovanni, it was a feast to the ears. The script I thought was of exceptional quality particularly during the finale of Marriage of Figaro(one of the most beautiful tender moments in any opera is where the countess forgives her husband), and the direction was very fine. As many reviewers have pointed out, this is more about the mediocrity and envy of Salieri than it is of the eccentric genius of Mozart, thus the story was compelling and intriguing. The acting is wonderful; Tom Hulce is excellent as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, yeah his laugh is a tad grating, but I loved the manic and eccentric interpretation Hulce gave. Elizabeth Berridge is suitably petite and alluring as wife Constanze while Jeffrey Jones is delightful as Emperor Joseph II. For me though, F Murray Abraham gave the film's best performance, for he was absolutely outstanding as Salieri. Overall, brilliant film, gorgeous to watch, amazing music and essentially a must see! 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"Several comments in reply:1) ""Why opera in English?"" - Actually, it's pretty clever how they handle this... In the movie the Italian operas (Figaro, Don Giovanni and Salieri's Axur) are sung in Italian, but only the German operas (Abduction, Magic Flute and the parody-vaudeville) are in English. My supposition is that we assume that everyone in the movie is speaking German, but we hear it as English, except when they speak in Italian or some other language. It's like having a selective Babel-Fish (read Douglas Adams if that one is lost on you).2) ""Why would they refer to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart as Wolfie?"" Believe it, because they did. Constanza refers to Mozart numerous times in her letters as ""Wolferl"" which could translate to English as ""Wolfie""... also believe me that she (and others) had names for him that would cause Buddy Hackett to blush. The letters of the Mozart family (Wolferl, his sister ""Nannerl"", and papa and mama Mozart) are full of scatalogical references and sexual humor that still seems pretty crude in our day and age. 3) Salieri. Yes, he is quite maligned. I think everyone knows that. He was one of the most famous composers in Europe and gave lessons in vocal composition to Beethoven, among others. He even commanded one of the artillery batteries in the premiere of Beethoven's ""Wellington's Victory"". However, some of Beethoven's conversion books survive where Beethoven's nephew Karl writes that Salieri has gone mad and claims that he murdered Mozart. It's not true, of course, but could very well have been the product of an enfeebled mind."
"If you want to learn how to act, watch F Murray Abraham in Amadeus. You could not see a better exposition of the art of acting. Every gesture, expression and movement conveys his emotions in infinite detail. You know exactly what's going through his mind, and why. Tom Hulce gives a very good performance, but Abraham is exceptional throughout, and well deserved the Oscar.The only downside to this film is the director's cut edition - the additional scenes spoil the original thrust of the film, and lengthen it unnecessarily. For preference see the theatrical release."
"Amadeus actually caught my attention, in parts. It has excellent performances from F. Murray Abraham as a semi-famous musician who is incredibly jealous yet fascinated with the prodigy Amadeus, played to utter perfection by Thomas Hulce (love that laugh). The theme of competition is one that director Milos Forman latches onto and gets enough juice and dramatic tension to pull off the epic nature of the film, both personal and extreme. Often quite good, however suffers from the overlong-ness and sometimes it is impossible to keep attention, however it snaps back every once in a while. Period detail and is to the dot. And the music makes up anything else I could want in a film. A-"
"To be blunt, I found AMADEUS to be one of the most Overrated and preposterous bores in all of motion picture history, and that goes back a long way now. It's not very often that I'm this clueless as to the almost universal appeal of a certain highly revered work of cinematic art, but I just couldn't help wondering just what was supposed to be so damned compelling about this very, very lengthy and dramatically vacant exercise in tedium?For openers, I just couldn't buy Tom (NATIONAL LAMPOON'S ANIMAL HOUSE) Hulce as ""the"" Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. From the very moment he first came on screen, groping after an equally miscast Elizabeth Berridge as his fiancée-wife, I knew I was in for a very rough ride; here I was only 20 minutes into this thing and already the leading lovers were utterly irritating ... and with 140 minutes left to go!Hulce looks like what he is - a 20th Century guy in a 1700's period white wig - and though she's actually over the age of 20, Berridge hardly appears old enough to play anything but his kid sister. Somebody should have told these two to lose their modern accents; Berridge loves to say ""gonna"" (""I'm not gonna marry you"") and she tells someone that ""only an idiot would ask Wolfie to work on that 'stuff'"". Oh well. All the same, I'd imagine that speaking in a proper 1700's dialect would have sounded even more out of date while delivering such silly dialog as this:MOZART: ""Here, everything goes backwards. People walk backwards and dance backwards and sing backwards and even talk backwards.GIRL: ""That's stupid"".MOZART: ""Why? People fart backwards..."" How idiotic. But this is not limited only to these two bozos; even another character uses the modern expression: ""if you marry him you won't have a pot to p*ss in"". It also seems like the phrase ""kiss my ass"" was very popular back in the days of Mr. Wolfie, too.Enough about the dialog. There is still one glimmer of hope in all this mess - and that's F. Murray Abraham (who won the Best Actor Oscar) as Antonio Salieri. What very little there is to admire in this movie is solely owed to his interesting performance, and in the character himself. Maestro Salieri's overwhelming envy of his childish colleague's superior talents, and the gradual resentment he feels toward God for leaving him in the dust of mediocrity, is the only saving grace keeping the film from total ruin. It's a pity that this angle of the story was historical fiction, though.And then there was that giggle... that ever-present, idiotic giggle...* out of ****"
"The highest praise I have for this movie is that the music is good, but of course that is no thanks to the filmmakers. Your 160 minutes (180 for the director's cut) would be better spent listening to Mozart's music alone.How could I say such things about this Best Picture Oscar winner, this universally acclaimed masterpiece, which has been included among films such as Citizen Kane and the Godfather on numerous ""Bestest-ever-movies-in-the-history-of-the-past"" lists? Well, I also disliked ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (Forman's other vastly overrated dud) so I am no stranger to blasphemy against the film canon.To be fair, I liked this movie the first time I saw it -- when I was 8 years old. I liked it largely because it was one of the few ""grown-up"" movies I could fully understand at the time. Upon viewing it again a good decade years later, I realized why: the film explicates its themes in such a blatantly obvious manner that it insults the intelligence of ""grown-up"" viewers.The most flagrant and pervasive example: F. Murray Abraham's (Salieri's) entirely redundant voice-over narration. Tom Hulce's over-the-top performance as an arrogant, childish Mozart, complemented by Abraham's over-the-top sulking and scowling, is more than enough to tell us that Mozart is obnoxious and that Salieri dislikes him. But alas, Salieri must narrate to us his already obvious disdain and shock that this person could be ""God's instrument."" The viewer can certainly also gather from Salieri's exaggerated swooning over Mozart's scores that despite his contempt for Mozart the person, he is still infatuated with his music. Still, we must have this narrated to us as well.Two-time Academy Award-winning screenwriter William Goldman (""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"" ""All the President's Men"") says that what makes a great screenplay (and thus, a great movie) is SUBTEXT  what is happening beneath the surface of the scene, what is conveyed and understood, but not stated. In ""Amadeus,"" there are fleeting moments of subtext, such as Katerina Cavalieri's piano lesson with Salieri, in which it is clear that Salieri is in love with her, and the subsequent scene at the opera, in which it is apparent that she has had an affair with Mozart. But the subtext in these scenes is instantly killed by the ""Spark Notes""-like narration in which Salieri tells us that he loved her, and knew at that moment that Mozart had ""had"" her. And Salieri, is it really necessary, while burning a statue of Jesus on the cross (a heavy-handed enough symbol as it is), to narrate that you are angry with God? Other annoyances abound in ""Amadeus,"" including the miscast Hulce, Jeffrey Jones, and Elizabeth Berridge, their laughable acting not aided by their very American accents. It becomes difficult to believe we are watching 18th century Germans when one actor sounds like a Shakespearean Brit and one sounds like a cowboy.The movie does boast some strengths aside from Mozart's music: the art direction and costumes are terrific, for instance. Even the theme of pride and jealousy among artists is valid and powerful; if only it were handled with just a touch of subtlety then this could have been the masterpiece it is widely (and wrongly) considered to be."
"I'll keep it short as others have covered this travesty adequately, I think.Basically, take one of the most talented composers / musicians to have ever lived, make him come across as a complete bumbling idiot with a very annoying and persistent laugh, and that just about covers the central problems with this film, plot aside.I love much of Mozart's music and have read a biography about him, and as such I got the impression that I'd like him as a person. This film would've made me dislike him intensely had I not read about him prior. Try watching this film for 10 minutes and not thinking 'what an annoying idiot Mozart is'. He just comes across as somebody who can play and write music, but is pretty much useless at every other facet in life, and is very irritating with it."
"Visually, the movie is pretty, and F. Murray Abrahamson's performance as Salieri is what keeps the movie going. However, the movie is overlong and the title character is depicted as a buffoon who can compose great works without even trying. Arguably it is natural for Hollywood to take artistic license and not try to be too realistic, but in this case they overdid it.For one thing, Mozart wasn't a magician who could create beautiful music without effort; indeed his music was the result of hard work. Also, the movie implies that Salieri might have murdered Mozart overnight while his wife and child were away; another reviewer had noted that Mozart died in the evening so that scenario is pure fiction. Salieri might have hated Mozart, but it is unlikely he had the opportunity or willingness to resort to murder.This could have been a better movie if they tried to be more realistic."
"Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham, in an outstanding performance), the Vienna court's composer, is in the end of his life in an asylum. He receives the visit of a priest and tell him how he destroyed Mozart (the actor who has disappeared from the screens Tom Hulce, also in a marvelous performance). Then, the story of Mozart, through the jealousy and admiration of Salieri, is told to the viewers in a spectacular movie. The performances of the cast, the direction, soundtrack, costumes and photography are wonderful. A curiosity: Cynthia Nixon (Miranda, from Sex and the City) has a small, but relevant participation in this movie as the servant Lorl. A movie to be watched many times. The viewers who appreciate excellent movies and classic music will certainly love it. My vote is ten."
"Mediocrity is not only the topic of this movie but also the movie itself. Is is mediocre to say least. One would expect more out of a movie called Amadeus. The correlation with Mozart is totally out of place. There is nothing in this movie about nobility, greatness, extraordinary people or anything else among the lines of higher understanding or one self's quest for betterness.The characters behave totally out of place. The action is taking places in the mids of aristocratic society yet everyone from the emperor to the opera director and to the servants behave like 21st century below-average income American citizens. The German (or Austrian) culture is fully ignored giving way to the ""american style"" (as it appears to common individual, not as it is in real life).The actions the characters take, as well as the results of those actions, are totally unwarranted. No reason is given as to way the character would act in the manner described or why their actions would yield the shown effect. This is deliberately so that it allows for ""desire gratification"". This is taking a wish out of real-life (son-father relationships is the mill for most such wishes in this movie), setting up a scene that will make one recognize his (perhaps frustrated) desire in it, and then, contrary to what would've happened in real-life {and by doing so destroying character consistency}, gratify it (with the proper evolution in the plot). This technique is also used for social manipulation in forming a distorted view of reality. One example is when ""the great Mozart"" has to submit his work to be evaluated by a committee despite the fact his works is great, he is intimate (i.e. close friends) with the emperor and the emperor could just appoint him. Like please, get real, in life people DO get appointed even when their work sucks just because they have access to the decision factors. As it must've become obvious by now, I am highly resentful of this type of ""your situation is better than you think and you should accept it as it is the same even for the most noble"".Art should propose a message and argue its validity, not try to impose it by all sorts of subliminal affirmations.Acting is terrible. Like no one really expects the people playing ballet on the scene truly be ballet-players. But they SHOULD move in at least a decent amount of sync. And when the piano is played, again, some correlation between the melody and the motion of the hands over the keys is expected.That being said, this is perhaps one of the best movies for its purposes. The story is told trough the eyes of the mediocre court-composer Antonio Salieri. The troubles of the characters are the troubles of the average individual of the 21st century (like bad credit, alcohol, bureaucracy, father, mother-in-law, etc.). What disappoints me about the movie is that these issues are not treated from a higher-perspective like one would expect but instead they are settled within the scope and understanding of the average individual."
"It is not a bad movie, certainly not a masterpiece as claimed by most people in this web page either. In total it is mediocre and forgettable. I really prepared to like it. I love this kind of theme: 'the burden bestowed together with gift. By the end you are not sure how to look at a genius mind: a blessing or a curse.' But it turned out to me a major disappointment. I was most deeply let down by the portrait of Mozart. I wouldn't have mind it so much if the movie hasn't kept on pressing the point via the statement of Salieri: the contradiction within Mozart - God's voice from a unworthy man. The movie totally failed itself in this aspect. On one hand Salieri went on and on with how magnificent and brilliant Mozart's music is that my head starts to ache. On the other hand Mozart has shown himself as a funny, sincere, self-confident man, cute and cuddly, with an off-beat laugh, a loyal son, a tender husband, simply an example of morality. It is a mystery that how come he didn't become the most popular man in Vienna. So many other works have done it much better, 'moon and six pence' and 'shine' to name a few, over the dark anti-social side of genius that 'Amadeus' in corporation only offered a very pale and shallow endeavor. Another thing bugged me is the other main character Salieri. He blamed himself to madness and tempted suicide. For what? What EXACTLY had he done to Mozart? True, he has not been a true friend to Mozart. Is that the reason Mozart died? No way. Those little tricks he had applied to harm Mozart, did they succeed? You better be kidding me. From what I can see they either missed miserably or by the unexpected turn of events helped Mozart instead. He hated Mozart and wished him dead, but that didn't make him a murderer. The director overdid the contrast between the two main characters and massed it up. And, the maid, played by the one of the ladies out of the sex and city. What an annoy! She lamenting 'Oh I am scared!' For what! and tears over Mozart's death. Again, for what? When did she grow so emotional over Mozart? What the director was thinking, did he forgot the story? Everybody hates Mozart, right? In conclusion, everything is pretty lame here, plot, direction and acting. Only recommended if you are an opera nut. Otherwise, skip it."
"'Amadeus' is arguably one of the most ambitious films of the 1980s. It presents a popularized account of the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart following his arrival in Vienna from Brno, at the age of 17. His reception by his new patron, Emperor Joseph II, disturbs courtier and established composer Antonio Salieri, who becomes consumed with a burning, selfish passion to physically eliminate Mozart, while recognizing the latter's unique musical genius.Aside from adding considerable interest to an otherwise prosaic script, Salieri's confessional narration that guides the film provides the vehicle for a truly phenomenal performance by actor Frank Murray Abraham. Milos Forman's thorough direction augments Abraham's superb theatrical delivery, and is in turn amplified by the outstanding soundtrack furnished by Sir Neville Marriner and the Academy of St Martin in the Fields.Inevitably, most of the remaining protagonists fade miserably in comparison to Abraham, including the overacting Tom Hulce, as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Elizabeth Berridge, as Constanze Mozart -both complete with distinct Yankee and Texan accents respectively. This latter aspect is arguably symptomatic of a deeper flaw in the film, which subscribes to a somewhat Americanized version of W.A. Mozart's character, overstressing the composer's historically unfounded maverick and nonconformist traits. There is also little -if any- historical evidence of any schemes by Salieri against W.A. Mozart. Indeed, the film's commitment to historical accuracy appears to be exhausted at a number of pictorial shots of Vienna and the striking facial resemblance of actor Jeffrey Jones to Emperor Joseph II.Yet, the film's daring illustration of the many negative sides of Mozart's character, including his artistic arrogance and his self-destructive womanizing, is commendable, as is its achievement to popularize the music of one of the icons of Western musical tradition. Overall a satisfactory result, 6.4 out of 10."
"I re-watched this film recently after many years, and my opinion of it hasn't changed. This is a terribly flawed, disappointing film that's unjustly considered a classic. It had great potential, a biography of the great Mozart seen through the eyes of a mediocre composer, but the result fails in many areas and leaves one confused and hugely disappointed. Everything about this film is top-notch except for one crucial element: the script. It lacks punch, it lacks heart, it lacks momentum, and it lacks any particularly memorable dialogue. The actors do their best with this below-par script, and so does the director and the entire crew, who deserved their Oscars, but the film really suffers from its by-the-numbers screenplay by Peter Schaffer. It's clear he's a passionate music-lover, but it's also clear he isn't able to construct a compelling narrative too. I've never seen the play, but I've heard it's better than this film. I certainly hope so. Somehow those moments that are intended to generate emotions in the audience never really pay off. We never feel like something horrible has happened, the events onscreen never really involve you, but make you hope the film will get better. Playing loud classical music on the background for dramatic impact may be effective for some, but not for me. However, the film is exceptionally well filmed. The cinematography, sets, and costumes make this a real visual treat, and the actors are all wonderful in their roles. And of course the classical music score makes for wonderful listening. With all these impressive elements, it's a shame that the film's core, the script, is so bland and uninvolving. No matter how good a cast and crew you've got at your disposal, if your script is mediocre, then your movie will be too, and AMADEUS is perfect proof of this."
I was assuming this would be a study of the composer that was focused on his music - instead what I got was 'Animal House' antics by the main character - Mozart. It seems this film was from the 1970's directors mindset of Altman or Mazursky....if a critical insightful scene can be turned into slapstick then full speed ahead. As another reviewer stated save for F. Murray Abraham there wasn't another actor or actress worth a darn in this mess..Mozart was a genius and also had deep faith as noted by his final compositions - you'd never know it by this pathetic biopic just as the powers that be omitted in their biopic of Dutch Shultz in 'Billy Bathgate' his (Schultz) pleading to have someone get him a Catholic Priest to baptize and hear his confession before he died in Newark-NJ. His wish was fulfilled but Hollywood made sure that triubling fact wasn't included.
"In a telling scene, after Mozart has performed his genius work to tepid applause, Salieri, self-confessed patron saint of mediocrity, performs his to wild acclaim and receives a medallion from the emperor.That is rather like this receiving so many Oscars and so much praise.It is not a bad film, indeed it is often visually stunning, however at well over 3 hours it does flag in many places. The use of quite earthy American accents among the gentry of 18th century Europe is also somewhat grating (although this is what may have endeared it to the academy awards)however the real problem is the script.The script labours the same point of coarse genius versus pious mediocrity over and over. There is a curiously 20th century lack of deference to one's social betters (such as Mozart's wife constantly and annoyingly always referring to him as ""Wolfy"").But this pales by comparison to the hatchet taken to Salieri. The author has taken the real life rivalry and created a fantasy completely removed from history. Salieri had nothing to do Mozart's requiem or indeed Mozart's death. The true history is actually far more interesting than this fabrication.Salieri as written here, is a one dimensional villain. One almost expects him to be swirling a moustache. Of course this is merely a film, a piece of fiction. But since it deals with real historical characters, it does have a duty not to slander someone unfairly."
"Completely fictionalized film about Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart the great composer. Mozart is played as a complete buffoon by Tom Hulce who must have thought he was still acting in Animal House. Peter Shaffer's play is not based at all upon the life of Mozart. The depiction of Mozart as such an idiot is a travesty. It's too bad people watch this film and think this is the way Mozart was. He wasn't. F. Murray Abraham plays Antonio Solierie, the now forgotten contemporary composer of Mozart who envied and admired him. He is also completely wrong historically.The only things accurate about the film are the costumes and the music so for those reasons it's recommended. Mozart's' great music will maybe gain new admirers through this film."
"Amadeus is a wondrous, if factually dubious spectacle, but be careful to watch the original theatrical edition rather than the director's cut. The film critic for the Toronto Globe and Mail said that Amadeus needs an extra 20 minutes running time like the Magic Flute needs a drum solo, and he was right.It is a rare case of film studio being wise to order cuts. The only other example that springs to mind is James Cameron's pious additions to The Abyss for his ""special edition"". The added scenes do add slightly to our understanding of the story, but two hours and 38 minutes is simply too long, especially for a director as methodical as Milos Forman."
"After not having seen ""Amadeus"" for many years, I impulsively bought the director's cut edition which was on sale at the local wholesale club. It is everything I remember about it.First the good...The score is wonderful! As noted in the bonus materials, the music - all Mozart's and not adapted - actually becomes another character in the movie. It's glorious! Milos Forman also made the conscious decision to use a variety of Mozart's music and not just a few familiar pieces and it adds immeasurably to the enjoyment of the movie. Of course, the other can work well as well - e.g. ""Elvira Madigan"", where Mozart's 21st piano concerto became ""the Elvira Madigan theme"".The direction and cinematography are gorgeous and impeccable. This is a beautifully-crafted film which invokes a great sense of time and place.Now for the bad...The myth of Salieri's murder or attempted murder has been around since the time of Mozart. It's the sort of juicy story that just develops a life of its own, despite all evidence to the contrary. It's unfortunate that it has been perpetuated by so many - from Mozart's time to Pushkin to Shaffer. The
Mozart's portrayal as childish and vulgar is inaccurate. He had a sense of humor and fun. Sometimes his sense of humor was vulgar in interaction with those closest to him, but he certainly knew how to conduct himself as a professional in public. In the movie, he is depicted as both immoral and an alcoholic toward the end of his life. Affairs have been speculated, but almost anyone who draws public attention has to endure such speculation, true or not. In Mozart's case, there is no serious evidence to back up the gossip. Certainly, he was not a drunkard! Also, although he was certainly not wise in his handling of his financial affairs, he was just as surely not without students and lived quite comfortably for most of his adult life.Salieri's portrayal as a mediocre composer is also wrong. Salieri was certainly in the shadow of Mozart, but he was a talented composer of mostly operas (unlike Mozart, Salieri rarely composed instrumental music). Had Mozart not lived at the same time, Salieri would certainly have been better known, but then the same could be said of almost every contemporary composer. It's worth noting that Salieri's students included Beethoven and Liszt.Costanze's portrayal is closer to the truth, but still misses the mark. By all accounts, she was a devoted wife and Mozart was devoted to her. She certainly did not leave for ""the spa"" when he was sick. The backstory of her as the daughter of Mozart's landlady ignores the fact that she was the younger sister of a girl Mozart had wanted to marry when he and his mother were in Paris. The older sister eventually became famous as a prima donna and spurned him. Mozart remained in good terms with the family and was boarding with them in Vienna when he and Costantze developed into a couple. Leopold Mozart was opposed to the marriage mostly because the family had a reputation for what we would call a Bohemian lifestyle.Leopold Mozart's portrayal is more accurate, but then his isn't a fleshed-out character in the show. Leopold's relationship with his son was complex and, after the death of Mozart's mother, increasingly strained. The motives imputed to him by the script are not only wrong, but over-simplified. One thing we do know for sure is that it was not Salieri that commissioned the requiem mass. Count Walsegg-Stuppach was the mysterious ""man in gray"" who intended to pass the work off as his own.While I enjoyed the movie enough to give it an 8 rating, it's unconscionable to think that many people may accept its slanders as truth."
"Just watched it again the other day, still love it, this movie doesn't age. It's tragic, comical and cynical at the same time, just like Mozart's opera buffa. I think Wolfie would have loved it too. F. Murray Abraham's performance is perfect, I try to find one scene where he's not so good, and there's none. Those scenes where he recalls his history with Mozart to the priest is especially well done. Salieri adores Mozart's music genuinely and resents his god given talent bitterly. Abraham just waves through the admiration, jealousy, bitterness, pain, self-loathe, cynicism and borderline insanity seamlessly."
"The 1980s was unique in that twice within two years the star of a three hour historical film (playing the lead historical male character) won the Academy Award for best actor in such a picture. Normally biographical films are considered box office poison, even the superior ones like Daryl Zanuck's ""Wilson"" in 1944. But both ""Gandhi"" (1982) and ""Amadeus"" (1984) were box office successes, culminating in the above mentioned Oscars for Ben Kingsley in the former and F. Murray Abraham in the latter. Both deserved the award for a change - both did fantastic jobs in bringing Mohandas Gandhi and Antonio Salieri to life. By the way, if Kingsley seems to have had better roles since then in films than Abraham, the latter has had a far more interesting career on Broadway in a number of plays such as ""Angels in America"".Based on Peter Shaffer's dramatic hit play, ""Amadeus"" is a study of frustration and jealousy in art - here in the world of 18th Century music. In 1785 the leading composer in the court of Emperor Joseph II of Austria (Jeffey Jones) is Antonio Salieri. He is well regarded by the Emperor and the other leading musical figures in the court. In comparison to them Salieri really merits this high regard. But along comes a young, fun-loving, and unpolished figure named Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce), or ""Wolfie"" to his wife Costanza (Elizabeth Berridge). Salieri is always the proper courtier - he came from a poverty background in Italy, and really worked hard at both his music (which he hoped pleased God and through God man) and his diplomatic skills until he reached his position. He first comes upon Mozart fooling around with Costanza in a break before a concert he is going to give. The unpolished bumpkin does not strike Salieri as a threat. But then he hears his music, and Salieri's self-esteem begins to crumble a bit.He tries to put it out of his mind, sensing that Mozart is his own worst enemy due to his unpolished manner. But when Costanza brings him some of the music her husband has worked on, Salieri (whose knowledge of music is really high) realizes it is the work of a genius. Sure enough, despite roughing the court's feathers, Mozart is slowly gaining massive public and court support. Occasionally there is a sticking point. When some jealous rivals (slightly goaded by Salieri) argue against the length of one of his operas, Mozart teaches them a lesson by having the orchestra not play the music during a ballet between acts. Emperor Joseph is fascinated by this odd idea and asks why no music is being played. Mozart explains that the others think there is too much music. The Emperor (in my favorite piece of dialog - which appears to be true) suggests maybe they were correct. Mozart shows the Emperor the music, and asks what notes to take out. Joseph II can't give any answer to that one.The effect of Mozart's rise is to make Salieri feel that God tricked him in their deal - he would serve God by making beautiful music. But this bumpkin makes far better music. Bitter he watches for any opportunity to undercut his rival. Then Mozart's estranged father Leopold (Roy Doltrice) dies, and Salieri sees that this has an emotional effect on Wolfgang. Building on the latter's guilt, Salieri tries to send him into a decline. And soon Mozart's health begins to decline. He has been composing a requiem, and Salieri intends (pretending to befriend the dying Mozart) to steal it and claim it as his own work. I'll leave the outcome of that to the readers when they see the film.""Amadeus"" is told in flashback, with Salieri having attempted suicide about 1819 (a few years before his death), and recovering in a mental institution. He has also made a statement that he poisoned Mozart. This issue is not really settled in the film, and historically it is still debated with most musicologists thinking Salieri was hallucinating. Abraham's performance is wonderful, as he slowly comes to realize he has become the symbol of the mediocrity we mostly fall into. Hulce shows the bumptious reality of pure genius in Mozart, and how fragile it all was. Berridge is fine as the loyal Constanza, as is Jones as the rather good natured but fatuous Emperor, and (in his few scenes) Doltrice as the disappointed Leopold.The historical Salieri was not the equal of the big three of Vienna in the 1780s to 1809 (besides Mozart, Beethoven, and Joseph Haydn), but he was respected, and even gave musical lessons to Beethoven in this period. His serious music will never quite be accepted by the public after the big three, but both the play and the movie reopened interest in him - his work is beginning to reappear in some concert halls."
"Although filled with rather tedious scenes and occasionally lackluster attempts of humor, this is definitely one of the most remarkable movies in terms of drawing its audiences into the realm of the protagonists. This achievement is primarily brought by the carefully selected background music connects perfectly with the movies from scene to scene, but most importantly, all the background music are Mozart's compositions, and through this movie we celebrate Mozart as a great composer who can transfer his feelings not by language, but by music. And it is a guarantee that by the end of the movie, you will be so completely absorbed into this movie that you will forget to take the DVD out until the cast list is over. Unlike other movies, Amadeus requires the utmost attention to every line, every detail of the movie, otherwise you will be lost. For the same reason, you may actually appreciate watching this movie a lot more after the first viewing."
"Though Milos Forman is rarely mentioned among the greats of Hollywood directing, he has certainly left an indelible mark on cinema. Creator of at least two indisputable masterpieces, Forman's films have won Best Picture at the Academy Awards on two occasions, and he has also won the Best Director Oscar for these two same films. The film that brought most of his initial fame was the glorious 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' of 1975, based on the popular novel by Ken Kesey and starring Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher. In the next nine years, Forman only produced another three films: 'Hair,' 'Ragtime' and 'Amadeus,' respectively.Released in 1984, 'Amadeus' is based on the 1979 stage play by Peter Shaffer, which was inspired by Aleksandr Pushkin's short play, ""Mozart and Salieri,"" and loosely traces the lives of composers Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri. The film opens with Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) in a mental institution, after having attempted suicide. Now old and frail, he speaks to a young priest (Herman Meckler),who has come to hear his confession. Salieri expresses bitterness that his former-talents have faded into obscurity with passing time, whilst the works of the young prodigy Mozart (Tom Hulce) have become legendary. Having known of the talented composer for most of his life, and having developed a hatred towards Mozart because of his own inferiority, Salieri ultimately blames himself for his death. Through his confession to the priest, Salieri explains how his association with Mozart destroyed his entire life.It is perhaps surprising to newcomers that Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is not the main character in the film. As the skilled but envious Antonio Salieri, F. Murray Abraham is the epitome of good acting, delivering a dark and brooding performance that deservedly earned him an Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Abraham is mesmeric as the successful composer who makes a pact with God to be the greatest in history, in exchange for his complete and unwavering devotion. When it appears that this gift has been bestowed upon another, Salieri rejects the Lord, and makes it his life's mission to destroy the talented young man through whom God speaks His voice.Tom Hulce, despite also being nominated for Best Actor for his role, is often cited as the one misstep of the film. I completely disagree, since the idea that Hulce feels out-of-place is the very point that the film is trying to make. When he hears of all that Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart has accomplished, Salieri was expecting to meet a sombre, respectable genius, only to first come across Mozart crawling on the floor, engaged in vulgar sex-games and uttering jokes about flatulence. This is what ultimately leads Salieri to abandon his pact with God: after all his own unwavering loyalty, how could the Lord have chosen this ""unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat"" through which to channel His voice? Of course Tom Hulce's portrayal of Mozart was juvenile and somewhat irritating, since it was supposed to be.Hulce based his character's annoying laugh on real descriptions of the composer, which referred to it as ""an infectious giddy"" and ""like metal scraping glass."" Also, though the historical accuracy of Shaffer's play was met with much scrutiny, it appears authentic (if slightly over-exaggerated) that Mozart had something of a vulgar and loutish personality. For example, it is known that the famed composer wrote canons on the the words ""Leck mich im Arsch"" and ""Leck mich im Arsch recht fein schön sauber"" as party pieces for his friends. However, the supposed rivalry between Salieri and Mozart is most likely completely fictional. In real life, Salieri frequently lent Mozart musical scores from the court library with which he was charged; he often chose compositions by Mozart for performance at state occasions, and Salieri taught Mozart's son, Franz Xaver.Despite running for almost three hours, 'Amadeus' is a surprisingly easy movie to sit through, helped along by brilliant performances and a brisk pace. The use of a classical musical score  mostly comprised of Mozart's pieces, conducted by Sir Neville Marriner at the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields  is positively perfect for the film, proving that, even though he lived many centuries ago, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is still far better than even the most gifted cinema composers of the twentieth century."
"I've always hated costume dramas, especially when the story is situated in 18th century Austria or Germany. There is just too much gold foil, too much ugly wigs and pompous costumes, too much over the top decors, just too much of everything that I detest.Big was my surprise when I saw ""Amadeus"". For the first time I wasn't trying to switch channels as soon as possible. From the first minute on it had my attention and never let me go, not even after the movie was finished. What I liked most was the co-operation between the music and the images. It all added to the drama. If a modern composer had written the music for some parts of the movie, I'm sure it wouldn't have been as great as it was now. I've never been a huge fan of classical music, but I sure can appreciate it from time to time. And there can be no doubt about how good the music in this movie is of course. It's Mozart, what more do you need? If you can't appreciate this music at all, than I'm afraid there is something wrong with your education. There is more in life than screaming guitars or techno beats.So for me the big star in this movie was the music, but I have to say that I also liked the way the story was told. I liked the flashbacks, telling the story from Salieri's point of view, the old and bitter man who now lives in an insane asylum, completely forgotten and still in Mozart's shadow. He explains to a priest what exactly had happened and why he always wanted to murder Mozart. I don't really know if all this is historically accurate, but I don't have any doubts about the fact that this is good cinema. Overall the movie was great, but sometimes there were a few details that bothered me. My feelings about the costumes, the wigs and typical architecture you already know, but there were also other things. Mozart's giggle for instance. It annoyed me enormously. I understand that it shows that this man was still very immature from time to time, that he sometimes still acted like a child, but still... Nevertheless I have to admit that this is a wonderful movie and despite some minor flaws it was almost perfect. I give it a 9/10."
"The story of Salieri is classic. The guy just chose the wrong profession. He should have become a music critic, not a musician. He wants to compose to the glory of God, but fails, simply because he is not talented enough. On the other side he has the gift to see the astonishing talent and genius of Mozarts music. Thats what makes Salieri a unique character in recent film history. The best critic ever seen on screen in a leading role. Besides that, Mozart is not the leading character in this movie. We see Mozart from the eyes of an admirer. Thats why we get a totally wrong impression from the life and work of this musical genius. The ultimate climax of the movie, the requiem scene in Mozarts flat shows the melting of two characters into one. Salieri becomes Mozart for a night. The synthesis of criticism and creativity."
"""Amadeus"" cleaned up on Oscar Night, 1985, and in its time was as much an event as a film. It even spawned a #1 worldwide hit, the silly but infectious ""Rock Me Amadeus."" Then the movie kind of disappeared. You didn't hear about it much when people discussed great cinema, even from the 1980s. The actors, all hailed when the film came out, seemed to slip back into relative obscurity, except for Cynthia Nixon, the future ""Sex And The City"" girl unrecognizable here as an innocent housemaid. Maybe that's why director Milos Forman and the film's producers decided on releasing a special Director's Cut when it was time to make a DVD.The result, as Salieri might have put it, is breathtaking. The film breathes with new life, shaking whatever period-film shackles held it back in 1984. We see Mozart struggling to make himself an instructor for rich, untalented girls; enjoy with the common people of Austria a rousing farce of ""Don Giovanni;"" and finally get a satisfying reason for one of the original film's few problems: Why Mozart's wife Constanze angrily sends Salieri away from her husband's deathbed. The end result: What was great before is perfection now.Its brilliance is not in its costumes, its set design, its bravura performances or crafty plot. It's not even the music, though classical-music snobs I encountered claimed that was the only thing in the movie worth noticing, though in its hacked-up state it was more ""Hooked On Mozart"" than anything truly edifying. No, what's great about ""Amadeus,"" what makes it rise to the utter top, is how all these brilliant elements are brought together in a way that carries the viewer with it from beginning to end. Even if you don't get it all the first time you see it, your appetite will be stoked enough for you to wish to see it again, and that's where the film really makes it mark.Like other landmark movies, ""Citizen Kane,"" ""Psycho,"" ""The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly,"" and ""Jaws,"" ""Amadeus"" hits you a different way each time you see it. It's gripping tragedy, a sad love story, and in parts very funny, sometimes broadly so, like when the midget pantomimes Don Giovanni's entrance in the vaudeville show, or more subtly. Salieri is especially rich in this regard, the way F. Murray Abraham plays him. There's a great scene when he connives to sabotage a Mozart opera, only to have the Emperor arrive and undo his work in such a way to make Mozart think Salieri has in fact done him a great service. Mozart bows meaningfully in Salieri's direction, and Abraham's pained courtliness in his response is a sturdy laugh every time I see it.Abraham won an Oscar for his role, and deserved it, but there's great acting all over the place. Tom Hulce makes Mozart a high-living fellow with a juvenile mind and a poor understanding for the lesser talents of other composers, yet at the same time he makes you care about his many trials. Elizabeth Berridge is believably coquettish and lower-class as Constanze, and the Director's Cut really makes you better appreciate what a great actress she was and how unfair it was we never got to see her in another film this good. Jeffrey Jones provides much of the comedy as a Reaganesque Emperor Joseph, good-naturedly opaque, and there's a wonderful bevy of stock characters lurking in the background who all get their turns in the sun, like in a Shakespeare play.That's a good way to describe ""Amadeus,"" as the kind of film Shakespeare might have made had he plied his trade a few centuries later. The central theme involves one of those classic problems of life, of how one copes with the gift of being able to discern another's greatness without being able to produce the same in return, but there's a wonderful metaphysical mystery underneath, too, the kind W.S. did so well.Is this a film about the folly of seeing a religious design in the patterns of life, in thinking some divine being guides all and decides who is great and who is not? Some would say so. Others might incline to Salieri's own belief, that God is a being not of mercy but of caprice, striving to undo those who strive to be better than He intends. Finally, there is the idea, which I go with, that Salieri's great loss was not in being there when Mozart came to Vienna but to be so choked with jealousy as to not help him, despite the many opportunities to do so, and to suffer the consequences of seeing Mozart's posthumous reputation rise to greater heights while his own music ""grows fainter."" The brilliance of that last scene, of Salieri helping Mozart write the Requiem, is realizing that with a different, more positive and truly pious outlook, Salieri could have been Mozart's champion, and shared some of his boundless fame.Of course, this is all fiction. Salieri didn't drive Mozart to his death. Ironically, he was more a devoted servant of greatness, as history records him being the chief teacher of the one composer whose reputation arguably eclipses even Mozart's, Ludwig van Beethoven.But screenwriter Peter Shaffer doesn't let this get in the way of a great story, and so we have a great movie, and Salieri, a measure of notoriety his own music never brought."
"In regards to how ""horrendous"" and ""absurd"" it is that they base the movie around the idea of Mozart being murdered, well...start using your imagination. Not every movie is based on historical fact. This is a big ""What if?"" movie...it's not saying ""Yes, we believe it happened THIS way""...it's just elaborating on a myth. There's no fault in that.I found it an entertaining movie with remarkable performances by everyone in the cast, namely the two leading men. While perhaps it is not my favorite movie of all time, and perhaps it isn't solely based on fact alone, it was still an enjoyable and visually compelling."
"While there were good movies in the 80s such as Raging Bull, ET, Tootsie, Platoon, Glory, and Wall Street, Amadeus is my favorite. I admit only Raging Bull is more groundbreaking but Amadeus is fun to watch again and again. I still can't decide whether F. Murray Abraham or Tom Hulce should have won the Oscar. However Milos Foreman and the movie itself earned well-deserved the Oscars. The laugh is unforgettable and the ending was very dramatic and moving. While based on some fact the movie is more Hollywood since there is no true Mozart biography to make it 100% perfect. We watched it in a school class just a couple months ago and everyone into it laughing and in shock by the end. I had already seen it several times by then. This is well worth anybodys time. AFI's #53, 10 out of 10"
"This film must rate as one of the most wonderful movie experiences you will ever have. It ranks up with Citizen Kane- possible to watch over and over again and not grow bored, but rather delight in the constant discovery of new facets. Beautifully crafted. Stunning performances, breathtaking cinematography, and essentially perfect music. Watch this. Then watch it again. And again."
"This powerful narrative of Mozart's adult career in Vienna - largely devoted to his operatic work, as befits a theatrical event - runs about 30 minutes longer than it might have, and has the power to put attentive viewers to sleep, or into a sort of hypnotic funk.  Mozart's last days are stretched out inordinately.  Nevertheless, this film has depth, humor, and one of the greatest soundtracks you'll ever hear.  The historical facts are inseparable from the fantasy that forms the basis of the plot, so beware of citing Amadeus as an authority on the lives of Mozart & Salieri.  Mozart was not so unworldly in real life, nor was Salieri so obsessed with his colleague, at least while both were alive.  Mozart's music was very popular throughout Europe, though he didn't earn as much money from his compositions as he deserved.  While Mozart didn't die entirely forsaken, as the movie implies, he was a victim of bad health exacerbated by overwork.  Consider that modern ""recording artists"" like Michael Jackson, et. al. release a dozen new compositions every 4 or 5 years, while Mozart composed two full-length operas and the bulk of a Requiem mass, among other things - several hours of classic music - in a few months, while he was dying.  Anyway, about the movie - see it and fall in love with Mozart's music!"
"Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) was born with the love of and desire to create music. He is the Court Composer for Austrian Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones) and lives a relatively contented life, even if his music is less-than-brilliant. But when Salieri encounters Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce), the young, arrogant, vulgar - and brilliant - composer, he realizes just how feeble his attempts at music are. Salieri denounces God and declares a campaign of destruction against Mozart; he is enraptured by Mozart's music while hating the man, and will go to seemingly any length to destroy him.Based on Peter Schafer's play, Amadeus should be a great film. It has an intriguing story, a marvelous production design, full of glittering and gorgeous period detail, a talented director in Milos Foreman, and a score by Mozart - which, if nothing else, should provide some amount of enjoyment. So what is it about Amadeus that doesn't work? A combination of factors, from a bizarre cast to a weak screenplay with a startling lack of authenticity to an overall feeling of staginess that doesn't translate well to film.Let's start first with the screenplay. I am unfamiliar with Schafer's play, so I will not bother comparing his screenplay to the stage script. But the screenplay falls prey to something fatal: anachronism. The dialogue and characters are extremely modern to point of being post-modern, only creating an air of inauthenticity which strikes a false note from the get-go. This is a legitimate approach to a subject - it worked well enough in A Man for All Seasons and Becket - and, to be fair, using arcane period language carries its own perils. However, it takes an accomplished writer to pull it off, and if Schaffer is such a writer he doesn't evidence it here. The movie isn't convincing for a second as a period piece set in 18th Century Austria. As with The Lion in Winter, we lose track of the historical context in order to keep up with the witty and anachronistically self-aware dialogue, and the film suffers greatly for it.The cast is another bizarre aspect. The casting of profoundly American actors in virtually every role produces a disconcerting effect which only exacerbates the problems of script and character. F. Murray Abraham is good as Salieri, but his performance is subtle and understated to the point of being dull. It would have been interesting to see how the original Salieri, Paul Scofield, tackled the role; he was an actor who can be understated without boring the audience. Tom Hulce is an odd choice as Mozart, but Hulce actually handles the part very well, and is at least fun to watch. Elizabeth Berridge on the other hand is absolutely dreadful and out-of-place as Mozart's wife, with a distracting New York accent. Jeffrey Jones and Simon Callow (the original Mozart) are quite good in smaller roles, but they don't have a lot of time to register. The rest of the cast is made up of talented actors - Christine Ebersole, Roy Dotrice, Charles Kay, Barbara Bryne, Cynthia Nixon - with virtually nothing to do. Most of Amadeus's quality comes from its admittedly lavish production values, but when coupled with the ""modern"" dialogue and characters and the bizarre cast, they only add another discordant note to the film. The story is rather interesting - the idea of Salieri as a man who can recognize musical genius while lacking all but the most remedial talent - but it's overwhelmed by a plethora of banal plot ideas and character development and trite symbolism (reaching its nadir when Salieri burns a crucifix in protest of God's favoring Mozart), as well as horrendous pacing. Too much time is spent watching operas and musical performances by Mozart and Salieri. Not a bad idea sparingly - we ARE watching a film about a composer - but used repeatedly, they only slow the film's pace to a painful, deadening crawl. At 160 minutes, such sloth is fatal. Oh, the music is brilliant, but we've always known Mozart was a talented composer; we didn't need this film to tell us that.So, to sum up, Amadeus is a dull if nice-looking slog. To answer the Emperor's question: ""Is it modern?"" The answer is yes, and it's very much to the film's detriment. ""Though the libretto was written by accomplished artists, the plot is that of a third-rate operetta"" (Phillip Ziegler). 5/10"
"Without music, would life have as much meaning? Whether it's The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Frank Sinatra or Beethoven, music plays an important part in inspiring people. When writing, I like to listen to music, specifically classical pieces. One of the best classical composers was Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, whose life is brought to the screen in Milos Forman's Amadeus. Well, not all of his life as most of what is portrayed in the film never actually happened in real life. That is not a flaw of the film, however, as Peter Shaffer manages to still create a fascinating story that keeps us gripped throughout the three hour running time. Forman recently released the Director's Cut on DVD, adding about twenty minutes of new footage and it surprisingly enough, improves the theatrical version that graced cinema screens and won eight Academy Awards in 1984. This is the version of Amadeus more worthy of being in your DVD collection.Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), a court composer in Vienna, is excited about the arrival of his musical idol since childhood, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce). However, much to Salieri's shock, Mozart turns out to be a vulgar, immature creature who just happens to be blessed with the power to produce beautiful music. Salieri soon watches his world change as he realises that his own music isn't so great when compared to the impressive operas that Mozart churns out. After watching Mozart mock him at a party, Salieri decides that he must do away with him somehow and take his revenge on God, who he has since declared his enemy for giving the beautiful gift of music to a vulgar, little man with an annoying laugh.Milos Forman and Petter Shaffer created a masterpiece with Amadeus, a startling portrayal of two different men thrust together. F Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce both received very well deserved Oscar nominations for their performances and they both give their characters the right tone. Mozart is a fun individual who surprises people with his impressive music despite his personality (and obnoxious laugh), but is soon going to deeper into debt and alcoholism. Hulce portrays Mozart's nuances so perfectly and Abraham is just as terrific. One of the main reasons that Amadeus is such a terrific film is the fact that when things do not go Salieri's way, we are just as upset as he is, because we feel for his pain. Mozart provides Amadeus with comic relief, while Salieri provides it with torturing pain. That's just how good the performances, script and direction allow these characters work, especially in their final scenes together.The supporting players are also integral to the plot as well, though. Jeffrey Jones is almost comical as an emperor with an attention span of two hours and requests Mozart to cut a few notes from his operas. Catherine Berridge is the actor in the film given the most opportunity to shine thanks to the Director's Cut. Forman looks deeper into the character of Mozart's wife, Constanze and she is given a much more important role than in the theatrical version and there is even bigger reason as to why she is shocked to see Salieri in Mozart's room at the time of his death. And of course, I would be crazy of me not to mention the glorious sets, costumes and makeup effects that are so important in bringing 1700's Vienna to life. This is one of the best films to come out of American cinema and a treat for even those who aren't too fond of classical music. In fact, those who are fans will be very happy with Warner's remastered soundtrack of the film which booms through the speakers and you feel as if you yourself is in one of the opera palaces with Salieri and Mozart."
"This film might have been able to get by on wonderful music and grandiose spectacle, but casting an American actor to play Mozart (and his chick) is a serious mis-service to history. The fact that many reviewers approve of this movie & rate it so highly is proof of this. I'm not against American culture per se (far from it) but the Americanisation of history in films (i.e. which gives the impression that many significant figures from the past grew up somewhere near Disneyland) is a terrible thing - it whitewashes cultural diversity & gives a totally distorted view of the world as it was, and still is. This cannot be overlooked. If an Austrian actor was chosen for the part (not Arnie) the film probably would have made less money so I guess that wasn't an option? Better to cast someone who appeared in ""Animal House""? Instead of a ""Directors' cut"" how about a ""Realistic cut""? Please explain?...well, if one of the characters in ""Amadeus"" had stepped out to buy a cheeseburger from Macdonald's or had switched on ""MTV"" at some point in this movie, it would not have seemed out of place - in what's supposed to be the story of an Austrian composer who lived in the 18th century!  In other words, Houston, we have a problem!"
