"This movie has it all, betrayal, conflict and tragedy. I have to say that I couldn't live without it, effectively anyway. The political criticisms tear at the spine of the film and the beauty of it in such an intimate setting is outstanding. The use of such a rich, three dimensional setting defies what we have been taught by the mainstream as being beautiful and sets a standard on a budget that I would love to be aware of, that all Hollywood movies should aspire to. It shows us that film, real film that is, does not need $100 million to look good, rather the combination of a haunting setting in the middle of vastness and the equally haunting beauty of it's star, Gong Li, but at it's heart the house itself resembles a claustrophobic pot, boiling over the surface.This is in my opinion, Zhang Yimou's greatest film, it is a triumph in film form and narrative. The haunting sounds of flutes, a significant visual and audio element that has a mythical quality due to it's importance to Songlian and becomes an unattainable item of the gods when it is removed from existence when it is burned, becoming a tragic reminder on the attempts to vanquish the personalities of not only Songlian but all of the concubines. It's slow burning nature may repel the masses but anyone who can get a copy, do so without fail, you will never regret it. I cannot stress the importance of this film, we may see it as a study on the oppression of women in China, but this is universal, we westerners once did the same thing not too long ago.For me the cinematography is what sells the film, it is the best I have ever seen and ever will. If there is ever a film to promote the use of the three strip technicolour process once again, this is it. Long after you have finished your post film analysis, the light from the red lanterns will still be searing in your eyes."
"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)Raise the Red Lantern is one of the most extraordinarily beautiful movies I have ever seen. The sets are exquisite tableaux carefully arranged, decorated and framed, and then shot from an attractive angle. The scene as they drag the third mistress, kicking and screaming to the tower of death, with the snow falling so peacefully onto the rooftops was chilling in its effect. The startling blaze of color, light and detail within the houses set against the drab simplicity of the courtyards, continually provided a contrast between life within the protection and at the favor of the master, and life without. This dichotomy is symbolized in the vibrant red lamps and the somber blue hue of the lamps when they are covered. In this manner, the mistresses are controlled. I was also struck by the sonorous beauty of the accompanying Chinese music.But more compelling than the beauty of the film is the story Director Zhang Yimou tells, a tale of paternity and imperious privilege set in early twentieth century China. He begins with the newly arrived fourth mistress, 19-year-old Songlian, a university student who, because of the death of her father, is forced to quit school. She chooses to marry a man of wealth. She is warned by her stepmother that she will be a concubine. She replies, isn't that our fate? Her cynicism and then her robust energy in seeking her ascendancy over the other sisters engages us and we identify with her struggle.What is extraordinary about Zhang's direction is how easily and naturally the personalities of the characters are revealed. The first mistress (""big sister"") is too old to be of any sexual interest to the master, yet she is the mother of the eldest son. The second mistress, who has given the master only a daughter, still dreams of having a son. Her devious schemes and plots are hidden by smiles and fake good will toward her sisters. The third mistress, an opera singer still vibrant and beautiful (in a fascinating performance by the intriguing Caifei He), uses her allure in vying for the master's attention. Songlian, in spite of herself, finds herself caught up in the competition with the others.Gong Li, who plays Songlian, is very beautiful with a strength of character that one quite naturally admires. She has the gift, as does, for example, Julia Roberts, of being able to express a wide range of emotion with just a glance of her very expressive face.Serving as a foil to the mistresses, and perhaps as the most poignant victim of the concubine system, is the servant girl Yan'er, played with a compelling veracity by Kong Lin. She is occasionally (how shall I say this for Amazon?) ""touched,"" to use Songlian's term, by the master, and so she dreamed of being the fourth mistress. But when the fourth mistress arrives, her dreams are shattered, and in her jealousy she hates Songlian and plots against her. One of the most memorable scenes in the movie is when Songlian, thinking Yan'er has stolen her flute, forces open the servant girl's room and finds it flooded with.... Well, you should see.Note well that the master is only hazily observed. He is a personage, a man of wealth. That is enough to know about him. He is as interchangeable as the harem masters on a beach of elephant seals. But because he has wealth, he can engage concubines who must compete with one another through him to find their station in life. One gets a sense of what it might be like in the harem system practiced by gorillas and the sheiks and warlords of old. One pleases the master not because one loves the master (although one does of course because humans tend to love their masters) but because in pleasing the master one rises above the others. Thus the triumphant call, ""Light the lanterns in the third house!""Most people no doubt lament the life of the mistresses. Yet women in poor places may wish such a life upon themselves. But concubines are just prostitutes, really, one might say, trapped by a system of male privilege. But I would remind those who see only that, that for every wife the ""master"" has, that is one wife another man will not have. The system does NOT favor males. It favors wealth and privilege. In such a system there are many men without wives, fomenting unrest, which is why modern states forbid polygamy.What does a man do with the capital he accumulates or inherits? If the system allows, he spends it on women and the assurance of his paternity. And why is that possible? Because many women--Songlian is our example--would rather be the fourth wife of a rich man than the first and only wife of a poor man. Many women would rather be used by a man of wealth than rule the household of a nerd. This is the way humans are, and any sexist interpretation of this movie misses this truth.The real horror depicted here, though, is in the brutality used to maintain the system, not in the polygamy itself. The women who follow the rules and beget the master's children, especially if they are sons, enjoy a pampered and secure existence Those who do not are dealt with severely, branded as mad, or even murdered. Note the similar experience of the wives of Henry VIII, for example, within the English system of serial monogamy. This is a great movie, like a timeless novel fully realized, directed by a visual genius, from a script of great psychological power. Don't miss this one. It's one of the best ever made."
"""Raise the Red Lantern"" is set at a Chinese baronial estate, the time, the 1920s. But, as the family-servant dynamics are placed on display, the viewer begins to feel it could be a thousand years earlier. The story is shown through the eyes of a young college-dropout played by Gong Li. Family misfortune has forced her into concubinage as the ""fourth mistress"" of the Chinese lord. A headstrong woman, her relationship with the lord's household, especially the other three mistresses, form the basis of the story. But it's telling is as important as the story itself. This is a beautiful, well-acted, well-directed movie. Slow-paced, it ingratiates itself with you, drawing you in deeper and deeper. I can't think of anything that warrants improvement. A masterpiece."
"Every frame of this film explodes with excellent acting, cinematography, music and art direction. I never thought I would see something so beautiful in a foreign film since Ingmar Bergman's work. This is by no means, an art film this is a human film, while holding an ethnic background these people portrayed in the film are all of us and is probably what we would call a fable on the cruelty of humanity. I'am disgusted to discover this film isn't on video or DVD in america. It seems as if its popularity has run thin since the 90's but this is a masterpiece people!"
"I can certainly understand why this film is so critically acclaimed. Raise The Red Lantern is one of the only Chinese movies I've seen, but I'll definitely admit that it's unusual to see a film this stylistically masterful come out of Hollywood (although it can happen -- The Thin Red Line, for example). A lot of what makes this film work is Zhang Yimou's outstanding directorial style; his use of color against bleak background is especially effective. It's his hypnotic visuals that keep you interested throughout the slow progression of the story. And the amazing acting by most of the performers doesn't hurt, either; everything feels completely real.I think of this as one of those movies that you aren't supposed to enjoy; it shocks you, and leaves you just as disturbed as, considering the subject matter, you should be. The miserable story of Yan'er, the servant girl, is especially painful to watch, and the same goes for the unfolding of the last few scenes. But I think the fact that I was so unsettled by this movie probably just goes to show how well it gets its points across. And along with the remarkable acting and directing, that's definitely something to be respected."
"My interest was maintained throughout every minute of this rather long film. I don't remember when I've seen another film in which every single role was played to perfection.  (Incidentally, this wonderfully believable acting seems to occur in at least some, if not most, of the roles in every Chinese movie I see, from the mainland or otherwise.)The story is one of classical simplicity, in in large part presented with the same classical, clear quality.  The interplay of passion, jealousy, and revenge is reminiscent of Shakespeare, but, for me, more entertaining--if it's proper to speak of such ultimately somber and even horrifying subject matter as entertainment.I unhesitatingly gave a vote of ten, and noticed that a full 33% of voters so far had done the same--very unusual.  When Roger Ebert called ""Raise the Red Lantern"" ""breathtakingly beautiful,"" he wasn't exaggerating.  But beyond its beauty, its moral seriousness, the fact that not for a moment is it ""dumbed down"" in the regrettable Hollywood fashion, its superb acting, and its almost unbelievably perfect pacing, make it a rare, rare experience.""Red Sorghum,"" the only other Zhang Yimou film I've seen so far, I found somewhat propagandistic but gripping and visually stunning (even more so than ""Raise the Red Lantern."")  I will be making an effort to see more of this director's fairly extensive body of work.  It's a shame major theater chains don't schedule movies of this caliber instead of the torrent of commercialized Hollywood trash they foist on the public, which, alas, seems only too eager to wallow in more and more of it."
"In response to the comments that this film is boring, shallow or without a character to identify with: Please study some Chinese history before you make such judgments. The story we see is a visual treat but overlays a much deeper story of China in myriad aspects. Perhaps you are unaware that films and books of the period had to tread lightly on topics that were not merely taboo but could result in danger for all connected. Thus, a slight symbolic representation often took place. Sort of poetic shorthand. Not unlike Chinese art that may seem to be about the season of autumn but is actually about death or change or loss. Nevertheless, any film must stand on its own regardless of the background. This film includes acting scenes that are incredibly forceful and still so gentle. The photography, costumes, sound and music blend into a cinematic work of art. I found the character completely believable, a woman bound in a tradition from which she found no escape except death or madness. And for those who sneer at the opera singer, imagine how the music you enjoy would sound to someone who has a completely different background. Please accept cultural diversity and let your mind and heart be enlarged!"
"I don't care what anyone says, this film belongs in the top 10 films of the 90s worldwide...the story, the implicit attacks on the Communist regime, cinematography, direction, and acting (Gong Li was superb) coelesced into one extraordinary piece of cinema magic that transcends both cultural and language differences. The film was so refreshing and exciting for me, yet it was also quite a dark film. Not a lot of ""conventional action"", instead, the intensity of the film comes from the actor's and their emotions. A very powerful film, and disturbing one at that. Job well done...Zhang Yimou was brilliant with this one. If you're a lover of great cinema, then this is a must. I'm already hounding at Criterion to take on this film."
"It's been days since I've watched the movie and it still seems as though I'm haunted by it. A movie is yet to make the same impression on me. Yes, movies exist that cause frightening images every time you close your eyes, but they're mainly either based on gruesome scenes of blood and torture or involve ghosts and other somewhat fictional characters. Well, the director of Raise the Red Lantern required neither, the work, in my opinion, of a great artist and scholar of humankind and the human mind. From what we mainly know, only ghosts haunt the human world but what if we were to imagine that death is not necessary, and that instead our own selves can haunt the present even alive. What if through human suffering, rivalry, jealousy and the imprisonment of the mind we can destroy our souls and spirits. And what if even worse, it is not other ghosts or ""evil spirits"" that cause this, but our fellow human beings. I believe this is the reason why Raise the Red Lantern finds a small place deep inside its' viewers: it speaks of the horrifying effects of humankind that each one of us can be affected by  of death during life. Songlian, only nineteen years of age, used to attend a University in China in the 1920's, all until her fate took a fatal turn leaving her in the mansion of a wealthy man, never to know the outside world again. This mansion does bring its luxuries: foot massages, a private room, your own ""faithful"" servant and somewhat of a husband - all until your servant becomes jealous of you, you rival with the Master's three other mistresses, and possibly countless others to come, and best of all, most of these luxuries are only provided so that you could better entertain and care for the Master, including bearing children for him. Once the women's' dreams are lost, what remains? - a need for passion and attention is something that each of the women rival for, and which some would be willing to do anything for, whether or not it be humane. Jealousy is strong and deception all the more so; the characters' lives are all intertwined and every action can cause a chain reaction, leading to the degradation of the human spirit and mind. What amazed me most about the director's work is the use of color to depict emotion and the techniques used to create tension, fear, struggle and a distinct message and point of view without ever having to show us the crime being committed. Every season throughout the story and every character, personality and emotion is linked to color. The various use of color tinting: demonstrating sunrise and sunset, light emitted by the red lantern in its different shading and position, the symbolism behind the red lantern and the women's condition within the mansion, and the draping in black curtains of Songlian's lanterns when she has committed a crime against tradition are both visually stunning and extremely effective in creating the mood of the time. Each woman's room fits hand in hand with their personality: the opera singers (Meishan's) elaborate and bright coloring as opposed to the First Mistress' dark, old wood furniture and darker clothing. And lastly, what I have seen few directors do, Zhang Yimou shows us less to make us feel more: scenes of torture and crimes, in many instances we are not shown them or the faces, instead we only view them from the perspective of one of the characters. The use of sound and long camera shots allows us to embody the characters and experience the story all the more, and because each of the four actresses dove deeply into the character of the women, this experience is truly amazing."
"Zhang Yimou solidifies his standing as one of cinema's most brilliant craftsmen with Raise the Red Lantern, a heartbreaking and fascinating look into the life of a young, well-educated woman who gives up her future to become the fourth wife of a wealthy landowner in 1920s China.  Gong Li, the director's longtime muse, delivers a performance nearly unsurpassed by anyone, male or female, in the 1990s (and many other decades, as well).  Her opening close-up is an indelible image of sorrow and resignation capable of drawing tears out of a statue.  Zhang Yimou makes films as exquisitely composed as any master's painting, and his palette extends beyond the obvious beauty of Gong Li to include the details of the courtyards, lanterns, silks, and rooftops with an inexplicable mixture of tranquility and austerity."
"Gong Li is utterly perfect as Songlian, the youngest 4th wife of a great landowner in 1920's China.  When she joins the household of the Master, with his 3 other wives and numerous servants, she is little prepared for the infinite under-currents and jealousies of the wives and the continuous baiting of the servants.  She is put in a house of her own off the main courtyard of the rambling estate, a vast maze of connected buildings.  But the wives are not quite out of earshot of each other, and what can be overheard feeds the hate among them.  When the Master has chosen the wife he wishes to spend the night with, huge red lanterns are lit and hung around the outside and inside of the house of that wife and she is given a foot massage with small weighted silver hammers whose castanet-like sounds echo through the entire complex, and they serve as an overt display to the others that they were not good enough on that day to win his affections and must try harder the next day.  As each jockeys for the Master's attention, Songlian is at first expertly played against the other women but eventually learns to scheme and conspire as well as they.  She is never sure exactly which of the other wives is her enemy or her friend, and the situation seems to change daily.  After she makes a grand power play that fails, in part because of a jealous young female servant, she is effectively in exile for a time.  However, a terrible, centuries-old custom will unfold in one of the topmost, locked rooms of the complex during her exile, and Songlian eventually discovers the dreadful secret.  This is a masterful film which only gets better on each viewing."
"I had a good day, so I selected this film. I have several films that I reserve for good days because I know they will reward. Its a sort of celebration that will send me into rich dreams, annotating my life.This has two known qualities that you, dear reader, can expect without knowing anything about the film itself.First, you will know that this is a woman directed by someone deeply in love with her. This doesn't always produce great films, but when the director is inherently cinematic, it often evokes something deep in the viewer. There is nothing in the world like looking on the face  the person  you are centered on. A million subtle decisions are made in each scene, summing to an effect that cannot be missed. If this had poor narrative qualities (and some of their films did) it would still have this quality of seeing into a soulmate deeply enough to be able to animate the skin.Its quite interesting when you consider the woman. If you see her outside of film, or in films made by ordinary eyes, she is quite ordinary. She has an atypical Chinese body: busty and widehipped. She is poised but doesn't have the neck or cheekboned face of other Asian women. Only under this man's eye is she a goddess. You can see this in the very first shot.The second thing you can count on is the architectural anchoring of the thing. This man knows how to use space. He uses it in the cinematic narrative, for example, if you replay the shots where the house of death is shown, and then the last encounter with it... And if you understand why the decisions about handling distance and surfaces were made they way they were, you will have entered a zone where from now on you will not be able to reason without reasoning with place.But there are other handlings of space: As with some of his other films, the building is a character. Its the noir narrator who sets the rules  often arbitrary  under which all characters are bound to operate, and which drives the narrative. Its a particularly western notion, this, and has gotten our hero in trouble, even banned. This part is following Welles and Kubrick. But he goes further than either of them with this notion that the light both has agency of its own (it selects which of the four wives gets a foot massage and sex) and is a part of the fabric of the buildings. The redness changes the spaces it occupies, bringing intrigue with the sex, desire for several things. Its quite layered, what is going on. These lanterns are the real master; in fact the person who inhabits the master's body is hardly even there. We never see his face.Because of the extensive use of hard planes and selfish light, there aren't many fabric effects here, as we'll see elsewhere.I am tempted to designate this as one of my two allowed ""must see before you die"" films of 1991. But I'm in too good a mood to make such a serious decision.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"""Raise the Red Lantern"" is a haunting study in oriental charm. The beautifully framed shots have a lingering, almost hypnotic quality as the household travels through the seasons in an endless journey that is guided by ancestor worship, protocol and ""doing the right thing"" even when it is bitterly, disastrously wrong. The pathos is etched in stark reality upon the face and graceful movements of Li Gong, who takes the lead as Songlian, the 'Fourth Wife'. One of the most emotive faces upon the cinema screen, she delivers an egg-shell-fine performance that is at the same time hardy, robust and wise.The audience never gets to know the human face behind the husband. Maybe there is no face, no humanity there. It matters little, because this is indeed the only face his four wives and his carefully ordered household ever see. He is indeed, their captor, not suitor. The ageing male housekeeper maintains the order of the house, and in his hands, the raising, lowering and covering of the red lanterns becomes a symbol that stains the entire film red.This picture needs to be understood to be appreciated. I can imagine that some will be frustrated by the apparent lack of action, the apparent lack of characterisation. But this is indeed the film's strength. We share in the pain and frustration of everything always being as it has been, yet nothing ever being really as it seems at all. The characters take on the mask-like appearance of ghosts, except that right in the middle of it all, living and breathing human beings are caught, stripped of their will, and subjugated beautifully; their sterile riches suffocating them.In the VHS version I saw, the cover notes were very poorly written and misleading, hinting at a particular love interest that (fortunately, I can say) is not in the film, yet ignoring the symphony of clashing hearts and minds that are central to the wonderfully woven plot. If you have the same 1995 PAL UK widescreen release version that I viewed, my advice is read the IMDb summary on the film and don't take the sleeve notes too seriously.Everything about this picture is superb. It is a two hour poem of finely balanced regret and retribution. Be fortified: and to really imbibe this at full strength, let the narrative disturb and move you. Let the pathos of the images wash over you, and be - just a little, perhaps - changed forever."
"Songlian(Gong li) is the fourth wife of the elusive Master.When she arrives in this secluded remote place the other wives pay attention,the film shows the female vanity and a competition to gain the master affection but why? This women seems not to be in love of this man but I was most intrigued by the presence and personality of the young Songlian,she seems  not to belong there,we know she is an educated lady who was sold as concubine. Songlian looks very delicate but she proves that she can be strong and  even rebel.The great  chinase Director  Zhang Yimou did a wonderful job to focused on the beautiful,flawless face of the impressive Gong Li.The film begins when we see her face on the screen and a tear drops slowly.Other poignant scene is when her flute disappearswhy she makes too much noise about it?is the only gift she had from her late father.When the winter arrives and the snow envelops this place it seem more remote and eerie Then a series of tragedies occur and the heroine starts to fade slowly. I think that the ending is so sad but at the same time is like a fairy tale To me.Songlian looks like a ghost walking around,alone without a soul .She represents a tragic past that will always haunt this place.I'm a big admirer of the actress Gong Li,all her films impressive me in different levels: `Jou Du'; The Story of Qiu Ju; Farewell to my Concubine. Her face and reactions is her treasure, Gong Li is the most beautiful actress I had ever seen, unique,talented and vulnerable. 9/10"
"Her father dead and her family bankrupt, 19-year-old Songlian (Gong Li) relents to her stepmother's calls for marriage. She drops out of school and becomes the concubine of Master Chen (Jingwu Ma) a wealthy merchant, who welcomes her into his household, lavishing her with treatment more luxurious than any she has known. Yet luxury, as always, comes with a price, and the three other mistresses in the master's house (Caifei He, Cuifen Cao, and Jin Shuyuan) are less than enthusiastic about the sudden presence of an attractive young rival. To make matters worse, Chen decides, on a daily basis, which of his four concubines will receive his nocturnal patronage. The woman he settles on receives all the services the house has to offer, and the women who come up short are summarily forgotten. Consequently, the women must jockey for position, all vying for the privilege of the titular lanterns, lit outside the house of whatever woman is lucky enough to receive the master's company.Raise the Red Lantern  a genuine masterpiece  bears the fruit of the planet's last three-strip Technicolor lab, located in Shanghai, and you can't so much as glance at the screen without noticing the difference. Lanterns dangle from the eves of the buildings and burn with lavish brilliance. The brightly clad protagonists leap from the backdrop of drab-colored stones. The lights of the houses glisten in the intermittent blizzards of oncoming winter. Every single frame in the entire movie is enough to make the mouth water, yet for all its deliciousness, it's never the beauty of what we're looking at that holds our attention so much as the ambiguity of that which remains off-screen. We never see the entrance to Master Chen's massive, sprawling compound, nor do we get a clear idea of its size, its layout, or its exact population. It appears to have no limits, expanding outward to infinity, encompassing all of China. Becoming China. Master Chen, for his part, is something of an enigma. At no point in the film do we get a clear look at his face. He's more concept than creature, inseparable from the oppressive rules of his house, from the dictums of tradition, from Chinese society at large.For China, the 1920s was a time of collision, between ancient traditions and the rumbling of modernity, between entrenched patriarchy and the almost teasing suggestion that women might begin taking stock in their fortunes. The protagonists of Lantern, and Songlian in particular, bear the brunt of this clash. Caught between the promise of freedom and the reality of servitude, they can only find power in the privileges of the house, and yet the more they exploit these privileges, the more the privileges control them.Yimou goes to great lengths to remind us of this fact, jerking us back and forth between long shots and close-ups, from beginning to end. Long shots create an almost Kubrickean sense of emptiness, dwelling on vast, impersonal spaces in which characters seem to vanish against their will. Close-ups zero in on all the incidental details that make up the daily routine  the foot massages and the preparation of the afternoon meals  all facets of the unassailable dead weight of tradition. Editing the film in this way makes us feel like there's no relief from the prison, regardless of our perspective, regardless of where we're at in relation to the subject at hand. Even the sound effects begin to feel like wardens. The clack of the foot massage, the eerie rush of the lanterns getting blown out in the morning, the periodic voice of the compound crier, announcing where the lanterns are to be lit, and who will receive the privileges that go with it . . . all of it creates an incessant sense of continuum. An unbroken cycle. A pursuer that never gets tired.I could go on and on with my praise, but doing so would be insult to the strength of Yimou's storytelling. Watch it, love it, and ask yourself why the devil they don't make movies like this all the time."
"We Americans are accustomed to our fast moving world and our equally fast paced movies but the older countries of the world have something very valuable to offer in cinema, if we can take some time, literally, to consider it.  This movie brings that mature stateliness of the old world before our eyes in almost an indelible way.Moving in a very slow and artfully calculated rhythm, one scene slides into another, each setting a perfect little painting that can almost distract the attention away from the action and the dialog.  The story develops gradually, starting out as a situation that is completely unfamiliar to the viewer and progressing stepwise through increasingly familiar emotional territory until even the 21st century American knows exactly where things stand.The story is absorbing and the comment on Chinese society is important in today's world, but the main interest for me is the mood of meditative quietude and the rather dreamlike atmosphere that is generated continually, until it saturates right through."
"Four women of different age groups are held prisoners in the estate of a rich man. Although they occupy houses of their own and have got personal maids, they are held like slaves, who have to be prepared to do their master services of love, whenever he feels like it. Then lanterns are lit in front of the respective house, just to signal the other concubines that they don't enjoy the master's favor this night.Songlian is a newcomer in this miniature world. She didn't want to move into it: After the death of her father she was sold to the rich man in order to ease the financial worries of her stepmother. Therefore she can't lead a self-determined life and continue her student's career, as she had intended.Unlike the other women, who adapt to the prevailing condition and who manage to give to their lives a certain passion or meaning by their continual intrigues and their wooing the master's favor, Songlian soon becomes a silent and introverted rebel. The mourning she shows after her master has deliberately destroyed the flute she once received as a present from her father reveals an obstinate clinging to a happier past. A simulated pregnancy, detected by the family doctor, eventually leads to a break-up with the old patriarch, who feels deceived and dishonored.
But Songlian's conduct only leads to ostracism and isolation, not to liberation. Her insight that the establishment of an absurd set of rules cannot conceal the actual insignificance of such an existence does not find an outlet in an escape and a new beginning, but in an insatiable longing for self destruction:""To light the candles, to extinguish them, to veil them...It has become a matter of indifference to me...What are we really, those who live here? We are less than nothing. We are like dogs, like cats...or like rats. We aren't human. It would be better for us to hang ourselves in that room...""It is not Songlian's life though that ends in ""that room"", but that of the vivacious third concubine, a former opera singer. She dies a violent death, and, ironically, it is Songlian who betrays her, when, under the influence of alcohol, she unintentionally gives away the secret of a love relationship between the singer and the doctor.When she is conscious again, Songlian has to accept the fact that this way to exit from an unwanted stage can't be considered either. Now she has no other choice than to escape into madness - quite a radical way to cut herself off from the life that surrounds her. In consequence, at the end of the film we just see her wandering around aimlessly, lost in an endless to-and-fro across an empty courtyard which the raised red lanterns in front of the concubines' houses illuminate senselessly."
"**SPOILERS**Set in 1920's China, RTRL begins w/a close-up of 19 yr old former student Songlian (Gong Li) as she tells her mother of her intention to marry a rich man. Songlian has had to quit college, as her father has died and the family can no longer afford tuition. Her mother warns her that to marry into wealth is to become a concubine, to which Songlian replies bitterly, cynically, ""Is that not our fate?"" Li has kept her face impassive during this scene, then just before it closes, a single tear slowly emerges from each eye, dropping one after the other. It's a beautiful piece of extraordinarily controlled acting.This scene sets much of the style of the rest of the film, as well as introducing the predominant theme of women's subservient, almost invisible role in that society. The mother is never seen, the camera stays static on Songlian, just as she is at the center of rest of the movie. Li is in almost every scene, everything happens from Songlian's pov, and in those few sequences in which she is not on screen the action is influenced by her character and they almost might be occurring just as she would imagine them.The opening also sets the emotional tone of the movie. RTRL reminded me somewhat of Scorcese's ""The Age of Innocence"" in that both are about deeply repressed, ""mini-societies"" built on social classes. The characters rarely express themselves directly or honestly, everything is below the surface, and tensions run deep. Periodically emotions and conflicts boil over to the surface and are quickly repressed again, w/o resolution. In this way the tension builds and builds w/o any substantive release.I won't go into the plot much, it's fairly simple: Songlian lives in a bizarre world, the fourth mistress, the newest and youngest, to the master of the household she joins. There are 3 other mistresses, each progressively older, each receiving less and less attention from the master as they age. The plot is essentially about how the mistresses vie for their master's attention while they attempt to out-manipulate each other for that precious recognition.RTRL has complex themes, but I think the film is mainly about the emptiness and pointlessness of these women's lives in a society that sees them as having no worth, and how they destroy themselves and each other because of their insecurities and lack of self-respect, in an attempt to achieve (what they regard as) some kind of self-worth. At one point Songlian refers to them all as ""living ghosts"". The women scheme and play petty games to one-up one another, they humiliate and degrade themselves and each other, all in an effort to be the Queen of their little world, a world no one cares anything about except themselves. The master couldn't care less, he laments that the women can't get along but he plays them one against the other and they all go along w/it, even though they know they're being manipulated and degraded.The women do not see themselves as having any significance on their own, it is only when the master ""lights the lantern"" in their house, when he favors them as sexual partners, that they become in any way of value in their own eyes and in the eyes of each other and the rest of the household. The master has an ongoing affair w/the servant Yan'er, who had hoped to become the 4th mistress. When Songlian barges into Yan'er's room she finds it full of red lanterns, a travesty that breaks the ""tradition"" of the household. Yan'er imagines herself a mistress, and this gives her self-worth, but of course it's false, just a fantasy. Yet her fantasy is just as real and meaningful as the actual mistresses w/the actual red lanterns - which is to say it has no real meaning at all.In the microcosm that is the society of RTRL women are barely acknowledged as human beings, they are sex toys and baby vessels. The mistress that has a son gains stature, while the one who has a ""worthless girl"" is ashamed and humiliated by it. At the end of the film, in a scene of chilling beauty set against the falling snow on the rooftops of the estate, the 3rd mistress is taken away and murdered. Nothing comes of it, no one seems to really notice or acknowledges it even happened. It's as if they had disposed of some garbage. Except to Songlian. In an act of rebellious despair, Songlian lights the lanterns in the house of the 3rd mistress and plays a record of her singing opera. It is as if to say: ""She was here. She was a person. She had worth."" In a final, great irony, the rest of the household thinks it is the ghost of the 3rd mistress singing and lighting the lanterns. Such are the lives of women in the world of RTRL: Ghosts in death as they are ghosts in life.In the end Songlian sinks into desperation and depression so deep that she is incapacitated, regarded as ""mad"" by the rest of the household. In the final shot she wanders aimlessly among the red lanterns around her courtyard, a trapped and helpless spirit in a world where she feels she might as well not even exist.Harold"
"RAISE THE RED LANTERN is a family drama about Songlian, a 19-year-old Chinese woman who chooses to become the fourth wife of a rich magnate.  The four wives then betray and backstab each other as each seeks to dominate the others.  The servants, too, become pawns in their game.Though undeniably well made, this is a hard film to like.  An oppressive air of joylessness weighs it down from first to last.  Songlian enters her husband's mansion in the second scene, and not a single shot thereafter strays from this prison masquerading as a home, where there is no color except for the red lanterns that signify the master's choice of which wife he will sleep with tonight.  We hardly ever see sunlight, only grayness. Full marks for the cinematic craftsmanship, but the technical expertise doesn't make it any less depressing.  One feels that happiness in this place would be an offense punishable by death, and eventually that proves to be true.  The wives compete with each other for a prize that is not worth the winning: the attentions of a man whom they do not love and who does not love them.It is tough to like the characters, who like neither themselves nor each other.  If Songlian were a sympathetic person, the tragedy would be more powerful, but she has a vicious streak a mile wide; her goal is to climb above everybody else and then wipe her feet on them.  Much is made of the fact that Songlian has attended a university, but her education has not helped her achieve any independence of mind, nor has it even liberated her from superstition.  And what are we to make of her tearful rage when she discovers her husband groping the maid?  Songlian knew before she ever married the man that she was sharing him with three other women, so this is not sexual jealousy she is showing, but resentment of a social inferior trespassing on ground reserved for her betters.Of the four wives, only Meishan, the third, appears capable of forming a real friendship, but we see it only rarely and from afar; toward the other wives she is as catty and nasty as the rest.  As for the master, he is a nonentity, a walking libido too shallow even to bother  hating.  The character I found myself rooting for the most was the servant girl Yan'er, who is just as nasty as any of the others, but is the only one to show any real defiance, any willingness to fight against the restrictions the house places on her.The clearly redeeming feature of RAISE THE RED LANTERN is Gong Li's performance as Songlian; she plays her character to the hilt, with amazing verisimilitude.  The writing may not allow her to win much sympathy, but you cannot avoid the feeling that this is woman, however awful, is a real person with real feelings.Oddly, the subtitles constantly refer to the four wives as `Mistress' and the IMDB credits them as `concubines.'  However, it appears that they are indeed wives, each married to the master; the Mandarin word used is `tai-tai,' which means wife.I think that Zhang Yimou meant this movie as a denunciation of polygamy.  It succeeds in this; never have I seen polygamy look less attractive for everyone involved.  On the other hand, with characters like these, you could paint a pretty unappetizing picture of monogamy, too.Rating: **½ out of ****.Recommendation:  Casual moviegoers should skip this one; hard-core cinephiles should not miss Gong Li's amazing work."
"The film powerfully portrays the life of Songlian (Gong Li) as she becomes the ""Fourth Wife"" to Chen a wealthy landowner in 1920's China. The main plot focuses on the complex ""duties and privileges"" of the four wives in relation to each other and their master. Each wife lives in her own house adjacent to each other. Each night they are obliged to stand in front of their respective houses and wait for the arrival of the red lantern. It is a signal from their master with whom he will sleep that night. This scenario expectedly invites a constant and intriguing development of plots, subplots and alliances among the wives in their attempt to gain their masters favor. In the end this dynamic escalates with the severest consequences for all. In this film Zhang Yimou visually introduced me to Concubine life in the household of a 1920's wealthy landowner. There I observed interior struggles of ""the Fourth Wife"" in ways comparable with the character development captured in films by Merchant & Ivory. From the opening scene to the very last frame I was mesmerized by the strong acting of all the cast but most especially with Gong Li. I was impressed by her abilities in Memoirs of a Geisha, but Raise the Red Lantern offered her a bigger stage to present the wide range of her acting abilities.There Gong Li presented a character who, at times, commanded presence and self-assuredness as she struggled to untangle the complexities of the ""duties and customs"" of a concubine in their master's household. Yet in the end, her fall from favor and her ultimate downfall was precipitated by her contrasting lack of self-control.I am pleased to have spent the time viewing this film. I would like to encourage those who enjoy great acting and a powerful story to do the same."
"Good movies sweep you away in exotic and convincing landscapes you've never seen or conceived of before.  The best movies create new rules to go with this new universe and integrate the two with an internal logic which opens doors to corridors of perception and possibility in your own mind.  RAISE THE RED LANTERN is one of the latter for me.  It's one of the best foreign films I think I'll probably ever see.As an American with very little background in 1920s China, I was immediately immersed in the totally new setting.  The devious characters and surprisingly slippery plot soon similarly captured my imagination.  Almost entirely a one-set production, RAISE THE RED LANTERN's claustrophobia is appropriate to the similarly stifled life of the protagonist.  The characterizations of the four mistress rivals are all fascinating and disarming; none of these women are quite what they appear to be, but they are all consistent.  Fascinating to watch, the strange camraderie between the four rivals for their master's affections is a testament to their isolation and loneliness, which their master seems to rely on.  Obviously the social politics of marriage and the sexes aren't very different anywhere in the world, though some of the Chinese customs might appear to be. 
I don't want to spoil any of the surprises so I'll close by saying that this film is accessible for anyone.  Although it does have the seeming liabilities of being a costumed period piece, subtitled and ostensibly a chick flick given it's clearly female-skewed POV, this is still surprisingly mainstream, especially if you have any interest in a culture outside your own.  Even if you're not interested in broadening your horizons, I suspect it will be of value for the light it sheds on the way women think.  Deeply moving and thought-provoking, RAISE THE RED LANTERN is an eye-opener.  It doesn't always make you feel warm inside, but you will feel something, and it will be real.  10 / 10."
I will be thinking about this movie for a long time. It is one of the visually most beautiful movies I have ever seen. The acting and plot and dialogue are all top notch. I'm talking myself into giving it 10/10. The protagonist genuinely develops as the film progresses and your views on each of the main characters continually shifts. One of the most powerful elements is that you do feel pity for the protagonist even after her petulant and vindictive behavior. The title of the movie appeared very odd to me. Probably the most apt title of any film as the weary rituals of the ancient household form more and more meaning. The symbolism of raising the red lantern is the soul of the picture. It represents the total power of the polygamist over his harem. Spoiler: One of the most interesting displays of this dichotomy between the power of the men and women that the man is having an affair. But when discovered nothing happens. He is already legitimately sleeping with 4 women. When wife number three is caught the penalty is death. I also loved the little power the women enjoyed: whomever has the lantern may set the menu. Our protagonist decides that what is happening is beneath humanity and would rather die than be part of it.The film feels slow burning but the intensity builds and builds as layers are added to the plot and each character. For a fan of foreign cinema: unmissable.
"""Raise the Red Lantern,"" as the English title is called, still remains in my memory. This is a wonderful film. It's no matter that it is subtitled. You can follow the story through the emotions and acting ability of its cast. There is no doubt that this is a ""10"" film! The story, while not traditional to Western culture, works well to keep the viewer guessing at what will come next in the story. Clearly, Li Gong shines in her beauty, her acting ability, and her magnetic appeal on the silver screen. The cast is well assembled and each perform their character roles with perfection. The set and scenery is opulent in design and yet suggestive as to how a rich man of the 1920s might live during those times. You should try to rent this film from a video store or purchase a copy of a VCR or DVD, if available.Folks who like foreign films must make this outstanding film a viewing priority. If you are just wanting to experience a foreign film of Asian vintage than this is one to consider. It is not your standard martial arts fantasy film. ""Raise the Red Lantern"" has a real story and real acting to match.I really like this film!"
"Can inevitable and hopeless sadness ever be adequately described? Maybe, but not, I think, by amateur film enthusiasts or any but a few professional critics, and only then if they can tame their professional enthusiasms, can write well and know when to stop. That leaves out, among us amateurs, nearly all of us. As for the professionals, I've read only two or three commentaries by professional film critics that I think do justice to Raise the Red Lantern. Partly, this is due to the utterly foreign, cloistered culture we're observing. Partly, it's due to the intense but withheld emotions and motivations we gradually become aware of. Mainly, I think, it's due to the fact that deep sadness simply can't be adequately described, and the more we try, the less we convey. Songlian (Gong Li), a 19-year-old student in 1920 China, must leave college when her father dies. Her stepmother arranges for her to marry a rich man as a fourth ""wife."" From then, Songlian's life, everything, depends on the attention she will receive from this man we scarcely see. The first mistress is middle-aged, serene and cool. The second is attractive and appears sympathetic and friendly. The third is young, beautiful and intensely jealous that Songlian may replace her as the most favored by Master Chen. Each has a maid. The servants reflect the attitudes of those they serve, but above all else, they reflect their roles in the Master's house. Again and again we return to an overhead shot that shows us where the universe begins and ends for Songlian...a stone courtyard with stone buildings on either side and the entrance at the end of the courtyard leading up low stairs to where Songlian now will live. When the Master intends to visit one of the wives for the night, it is the custom that the servants ceremoniously raise red lanterns outside the apartment of the favored wife. And this is all that their lives...and now, Songlian's life...consists of. There is no outside world, only their duty to serve the Master and to follow the customs of the Chen family, which goes back generations. If the red lantern is raised frequently outside Songlian's doorway, a servant tells her, she will soon be running the establishment. The other wives know this. Songlian is educated, sullen and resentful. She may realize that she must establish herself in the favor of the Master and find her place in the world of the wives, but we realize she may not have the guile needed. The intensity of establishing and maintaining ""place"" means resentments and betrayals. There can be no friendships. Songlian does not play this game well. Songlian's life eventually becomes as desolate as the cold snow that drifts down into the courtyard. Raise the Red Lantern is a gorgeous movie, as are most of Yimou Zhang's films. The seasons change from spring to summer to fall and to winter. We keep returning to Songlian and to the view of the courtyard, but we also see out over what seems the endless tile roofs of the Master's mansion. High on the roof is a small stone shed that is kept locked and which, it is whispered, had something to do with a former wife. At first the stone exteriors seem small and the interiors seem to go on and on. We see Songlian dressed lavishly to await the Master's visits. We see ornate furniture, wall scrolls, braziers against the chill and the red lanterns. We seldom see tears. Raise the Red Lantern is no tragedy, but it is a kind of slow-playing, hopeless melodrama. It is a reserved world where for these four women and their servants, everything depends on the Master. For Songlian, everything depends on her willingness to bend completely to this life from which she cannot leave, and to accept that there can be no relief from the need to scheme and plot to maintain a position against the other wives. To befriend can lead to betrayal. To sympathize can lead to rejection. To let slip a secret can lead to death. The customs of the ancient Chen family must be honored and followed, and can be cruel. To serve the Master whenever he wishes, with skill and charm, and to bear him a son, is what life has become, and there is no escape. The Master's life goes on. Our last view of Songlian is in the courtyard, in winter, wandering. Anyone who reads this should shake their head and wonder what all the fuss is about. Get the movie and watch it, then you try to describe it. You'll feel inadequate."
"This movie was amazing. I can't even remember the first time I saw it, but I was about seven or eight. I scarcely understood the deeper complications of the story, but it moved me, even then, and even though it was in a language completely foreign to me. The tension between the wives is always intriguing, and I enjoy watching it every time. Seriously, if a seven-year-old remembered the name of a foreign, subtitled film for more than a decade, and STILL enjoyed it when she saw it later, I think most people would get at least a smidgen of enjoyment from this movie. (note: this movie is not necessarily appropriate for seven-year-old's. watch it, then use your best judgment.)"
"Set in 1920s China, Raise the Red Lantern begins with a close-up of Songlian's face. Harassed by her stepmother to get married for over three days, Songlian finally consents. When asked whom will she marry, Songlian answers that she will marry a rich man. The stepmother then intones that if she marries a rich man then she will be nothing more than a concubine. Songlian answers that it matters little.Dressed in her university clothes, Songlian makes her way to the family compound of the Chen family where she is installed as the Fourth Mistress. Only nineteen-years-old, Songlian looks to be several years, by two, three, or four decades, younger than the first mistress. Who Songlian states must be one hundred years old. The Third Mistress, a former opera singer, is quite aloof and avoids making contact with Songlian. The only mistress Songlian seems to be able to get along with is the Second Mistress, a pleasant faced older woman.Within the environs of the family compound there are a number of rules. Besides small things like the specific table where the family sits for meals and pregnancy rituals, several red lanterns illuminate the Mistress's rooms where the Master will sleep the night and the Mistress of said rooms will receive a foot massage given by the skillful Auntie Cao. While the lanterns and foots massages seem inconsequential, one of the mistresses informs Songlian that if one goes without a foot massages for three day, i.e. the Master does not pay her a visit, the servants begin treating her differently. Also, the owner of the room where the lanterns were illuminated the night before can also chose specified meals.It is within this environment that Songlian has come to live. Seemingly hated by the Third Mistress and even her own maidservant Yan'er, Songlian, who was attending a University until her father died, finds herself tangled in a system of tradition where backstabbing is the rule of the game. However, Songlian is not scared to attack back even at the risk of the safety of others.Played by the stunning Gong Li, Songlian comes off as a strong, intelligent young woman who is unfortunately ensnared in a less than ideal situation. While living in luxury, one can sense the boredom she must feel. Seemingly imprisoned in her rooms, Songlian is not even able to keep a flute, an heirloom of her father's, because Master Chen is worried that it was a gift from a boy at Songlian's university.Like other Zhang Yimou films, Raise the Red Lantern is a visual delight. Set entirely within the environs of the Chen compound, one can see a cinematic glimpse into the lives of the Chinese privileged during the 1920s. While quite different than the Su Tong novella on which it was based, there were no red lanterns and the First Mistress's son had a special friend, Raise the Red Lantern is quite an experience that was filmed during the height of the Zhang Yimou/Gong Li collaboration."
"""Who is that?"" asks the sweet and innocent ""Fifth Mistress"" at the end of the movie. The Housekeeper replies, ""That's our Fourth Mistress. She has gone mad."" She must have been watching this movie! I can't say it was a terrible movie, since my wife was quite smitten with it, but from the start it just failed totally to connect with me in any way. It came across as bizarre, soap opera type of interplay between the various mistresses and servants of ""The Master."" All of them are jealous of each other and plotting against each other, and there's nary a seed of friendship or loyalty to be found anywhere. I suppose in some ways, if you have a bit of a hidden sadistic streak in you (and probably most people do, since stories about deception and betrayal always sell well, obviously appealing to unacknowledged desires within us all) then there will be something compelling about this movie, and, yes, it is kind of fun watching the women do battle with each other. Having said that, I still found my attention wandering throughout, and I nodded off several times. I'm clearly in the minority on this, but it's not a movie I would recommend. 2/10"
"I like most of Yimou's work but was disappointed with this one. He is a master of visual depth, colors, cinematography and scenery and this one is no exception in that area, but it's everything else that falters.The story is about a woman who gives in to family pressure to become a fourth concubine to a rich man. She finds herself in a huge household full of rituals, traditions and rules, where the women's lives are so empty and meaningless, they spend their time fighting each other for the 'master's' favor. Along with his favor comes other luxuries such as being able to choose the menu, getting red lanterns and foot massages.It starts off well but then the movie becomes an endless soap opera with catty, bitchy back-stabbings and petty power games. There is not one sympathetic character and the movie just keeps repeating this theme until the 'tragic' ending.So the story isn't interesting; What about the alleged allegory? Let's see, an attack on a repressive Chinese government with its rules, and its patriarchal rule over the people and/or its women? Well if the Chinese people are really as petty, childish and catty as this, then I sympathize with the government.A feminist statement? I don't think feminists would want women to be portrayed like this, regardless of how the movie attacks the patriarchy. In addition, she CHOSE to become a concubine.So what's the point?"
"Great scenery...and visual appeal, but the problem for me was that the story became too irrational. The 2nd wife was getting what she wanted within the confines of the current situation - once the 4th wife arrived... She blew it completely by having the 3rd wife outed which led to the 3rd wife's demise. It seemed illogical to me. No woman in that situation would do something so stupid. She would have guarded the secret and used it as a weapon. These women were first shown to be masters of manipulation and then their actions were idiotic. I didn't buy it. Okay - I did buy it for a dollar...but, I didn't buy the story at all. It wasn't believable."
"Think of this film as an old school Girls at the Playboy Mansion on crack.I love this movie so hard. Songlian (played by Li Gong) is my heroine. Not the I- wanna-inject-you-and-listen-to-jazz heroin, but a sad and lonely victim of circumstance rebelling against her fate.The opening scene is Songlian's face, worthy of any Miss China pageant, as a single tear rolls down her cheek she coldly states, ""Become a concubine - isn't that a woman's fate?"" Yeah, it's gonna be bleak.Each night, the elusive Master will choose 1 of 4 mistresses to bunk with and a flourish of red lanterns are lit outside mistress numero uno's house - enough lanterns to be seen from orbit. Why? As this is tradition. The chosen concubine is served her favourite dish that night. As is tradition. The mistress will receive a strange foot massage. As is tradition. She will be bed by the master and lavished with his attention. As is tradition. Surely as Songlian is Master's newest object of affection he should favour her, yet there are petty forces working against her bitchier than your worst enemy from high school. Each mistress has manipulative ways in which they try to woo to the master. Because they love him? Not even. Akin to Stockholm Syndrome a phenomenon manifests and the isolation and loneliness drives them to jealously compete and be top dawg of the intimate hierarchy. One scene that struck me was when Songlian encountered a Pavlov's Dog effect - her feet ache and itch craving a foot massage when Master chooses to stay with another. Fate is a harsh mistress, more harsh than the ones who inhabit the four houses of this movie. Born a woman, our heroine has been dealt a bad Mahjong hand, but will try to play it best she can. The film is one of contrast and ridicules archaic rituals and traditions yet depicts them with mesmerising aesthetic elegance. It's a masterful piece of work and will haunt you after the end credits have rolled. Moral of the film: Trust no bitch."
"I was dying to see this film after seeing many of Gong Li's works such as Ju Dou, and recent films such as Curse of the Golden Flower and Memoirs.I was thinking to myself, a movie about a guy who has four wives - how could this be interesting? Well quite simply, it's interesting due to the battle you see between the wives who are subtly plotting against one another to gain the upper hand in status and also self respect for a guy whom they don't love, but feel that he is the only one who can provide it for them.There is a sense of claustrophobia in the film, as our main character, Songlian (Gong Li) at first starts to think this new life as a concubine is quite glamorous until she starts to see the reality of the concubines situation. The shots of the complex they live in almost gives a sense of isolation from the rest of the world and that they are confined in their homes to serve their one and only master, the husband they all share.The title refers to the fact that lanterns are raised at one of the concubines' houses if the master chooses to spend the night with the one with whom he chooses. You see the four concubines waiting to hear the daily announcement before they sleep as to whom will have the pleasure of spending the night with the master.Zhang Yimou's films often have a message which can be interpreted in different ways. Some see this film as a criticism of the Chinese Government in that it represents 'the master' 'loyal followers' and those who break the rules end up suffering for it. But if you see it differently, it is more about the repression of women in China and how their only way to gain self worth in these situations is through their husband who has full control. In a sense, the women in this film are treated like, as Songlian says, as a 'robe' that the Master can wear and take off anytime he likes. Songlian struggles to obey all the rules but also tries to play the political game in order to gain the master's attention.With its simple yet very well told story, with a terrific performance by Gong Li and the rest of the cast, it definitely is worth the watch. Highly recommended."
"This Oscar-nominated film which was the favorite of many film critics represents the eighth collaboration between Yimou Zhang (Hero, House of Flying Daggers, Curse of the Golden Flower) and Li Gong (Miami Vice, 2046, Zhou Yu's Train). They make an incredible team and this is an incredible movie.It provides an inside look at Chinese custom as four wives fight for the right to have the lanterns lit at their house each night representing whom the Master will sleep with. There are really only three, as the Master is not going to choose old wife number one.Wife number three is a former opera singer and a diva that pouts when not selected, even though she has a backup plan or two. Wife number two is devious and uses others to get what she wants.But, this is about wife number four, who had to become a concubine after the death of her father. It is a magnificent performance by Li Gong and the costuming and set decoration serve to enhance her incredible beauty.I never tire of watching her and can never tore of watching any Yimou Zhang film."
"""Raise the Red Lantern"" is not the first Chinese film I have seen, but I think it certainly ranks in the highest echelons of foreign films. The depth - and psychological terror - of the film makes it a classic in my opinion.Songlian - a university student 1920's China - is thrown into a marriage with ""the master,"" a polygamist who already has three wives. The competition for the master's attention (and the privileges that come with it) are the sole focus of the wives. Songlian is the only wife that has been educated... and has known what is to be ""free."" In the constricted, feudal environment of the Master's palatial house, Zhang Yimou shows Songlian's physical and psychological imprisonment in a ""gilded cage."" The most horrific thing about this movie is the fact that, in 20s era China, something like this could conceivably happen. The way Zhang Yimou gradually unwinds the story, with sumptuous colors and the incredibly believable acting of Gong Li and the rest of the cast, is beautiful and has a depth that most Hollywood movies lack."
"This film is absolutely gorgeous. Its not necessarily the type of movie I would have rented on my own though, I was actually forced to watch it in my english class in 10th grade. A few years later, I saw it at Blockbuster, rented it, and saw exactly why it was a great movie, and its still in the top 5 of my favorite movies.Set in 1920's China, the story is about Songlian, a 19 year old university student who decides to marry a rich, older man after the death of her father. She moves into his large ""court"" and becomes his Fourth Mistress. She has a servant named Yan'er, who is in love with the Master, and is also the ""evil doer"" of someone of who is trying to sabotage the appearance of Songlian. When the Master decides that he would like to spend the night with one of his 4 mistresses, each one is called to a long hall, and a red lantern is placed in front of them, and then lanterns are hung, lit, and the mistress may have anything she desires for dinner, and gets to spend the night with the Master. This does not suit Songlian very well. We see that she has some sort of feeling for the Master, but after the First Sister's (they refer to each other as sisters) son, Feipu, comes along, she seems to lose interest in the Master.Songlian befriends Meishan, the Third Sister (a former opera singer) and sees just how far deceit can go in this ""happy household."" I dont want to give anything away for first time viewers because the ending is a shocker. I give this movie a 9 out of 10 mainly because there are a few slow parts in the beginning. I wouldnt classify this film as being artsy, but it is definately beautiful and was written very well. This deserved its Oscar Nod back in 1991."
"Raise The Red Lantern is very well made. The scenery is beautiful, the setting feels very authentic, and the acting has no flaws. That's all well and good, but throughout the movie I had one major gripe: I didn't care about any of the characters, except maybe one (the opera singer). From the master of the house down to the servants, every character was petty and selfish. None of the characters ever showed an ounce of concern for any of the others. I barely sat through the whole movie, I had a hard time sticking with it because I really didn't care what happened to these people, especially the main character. The main character was the worst of the lot, she intentionally chose her life as a 4th wife, and she spent the entire time being a whiny, stupid brat.Nor did any of the wives show guile or intelligence in their plotting against each other. If the movie was about a war of pettiness, I would at least expect a few clever ploys. Nope. Are these women just petty, bitter cows? Ouch!I'd give this movie a 3 out of 5 stars."
"Perhaps I was expecting too much. Other reviewers of this film have overwhelmingly ranked it as one of the best of all time, in any language. Sadly that could not be further from reality.At a surface level, this film is just boring. It drags on for far too long, with an extremely predictable storyline, single setting (in which everything blends together), and characters that, with the exception of Gong Li, each fit neatly into an archetype.Even looking a little deeper, if we are able to stay awake through this soap opera, the story itself is unappealing. Gong Li's character (Songlian) is, in a word, best described by incompetence. She arrives as a naive young girl and naturally finds it a bit difficult to adjust to her new life. Yet over time, she fails to adapt: her attempts continue to result in failure and chaos in the household, getting worse and worse each time.This is the story of an incompetent human being; to glorify or somehow romanticize her struggle into some sort of tragedy, with great meaning and beatuy, is a travesty in itself. Yet somehow my fellow reviewers seem to have deluded themselves into doing exactly that.I digress. If you are interested in watching the film purely for its techniques of cinematography, go ahead. Personally, even in that regard, I would pass, but I cannot deny that it is unique."
"This is a fascinating movie that you deserve to see mindfully. Zhang truly does it, in that he both gives us a clear picture whereby we can see ourselves with clarity and allows our gaze to wonder outside the walls of that picture. A fascinating interplay between these two notions of concentrating the gaze and letting float just so happens to power Chinese spiritual life, more on this in a bit.But now quickly to see what is it about, what clear picture emerges? A young girl has to enter a household as concubine, becoming one of four wives of a rich merchant who live inside a walled compound. So immediately the outside world of myriad possibilities and stories closes down behind her and us and life acquires a palpable order. Various rituals take place that together comprise a larger harmony. Magnificent red lanterns are lit outside the home of whichever wife the husband has chosen to spend the night with; the rest have to return disappointed to dark houses. A foot massage is given to the chosen wife that night, punctuated with a repetitive sound that echoes like temple chimes signaling the time for prayer. Other rituals: the camera itself doesn't roam freely but specific views are established. Looking down from the tiled roof, another facing the bed. The husband is never seen from up close, as if he exists outside this order.Taken together all these modes insinuate a world that is meticulously groomed and controlled, given structure and color that ritualize appearances. Very Chinese. Each time the lanterns are lit we know one woman has been chosen to be the center of this world for a fleeting night, life given a ceremonial glow.But is this harmony that we see? The obvious point is a critique of traditional mores left over from the old days and accepted unthinkingly, lives stifled by the walls imposed on them and how the four women scheme and vie for primacy in the order of things. It doubletimes just as well as a veiled critique of communist walls. Party censors thought as much and the work was banned in China.All of this will be readily available to the Western viewer from our own traditions of painterly beauty and institutionalized oppression. We can rest there and speak the usual platitudes about ""the human condition"", walk away thinking the film is all about how bad life was for women in China. Or we can - as with Mizoguchi before - attempt to cross into the world that gives rise to these images and reflects a more encompassing view.Zhang's meticulous abstraction (color - sound - camera - all of it bound by the cyclical turn of weathers outside) comes from a worldview where the same energy is felt to move through man and nature alike, not Western in the least. He's working in a long Chinese line of practiced abstraction with roots in the tea ceremony and the calligrapher's scroll where the effort is not decorative beauty for its sake. It's cultivated awareness that guides the spiritual realization that we are what we bring to life. The calligrapher controls his hand like someone who meditates concentrates his attention - so that it will begin to radiate effortlessly with what rises up from a unfettered, mindful heart.So if you don't just pass by like a visitor who looks pitifully at the cruelty of some faraway time and its victim? If you use the film to center within the walls of your own life that happened to you? In that case the film has wisdom in store, another view of seeing self and world.This is the notion that you have been born into this life and have now come to this house, circumstances made it so. Life could have been better, it could have been worse. We see a housemaid who'd love nothing more than to be a wife while the third wife manages to live a life without despair and regret that lets her sing freely. Will you add to the unhappiness, cause unhappiness to others, go mad?The title of this post refers to a mandala - a sacred space for the concentration of the gaze in Buddhism - frequently seen in Chinese temples; it depicts the universe as wheel and at the center lie craving and ego. See this like a mandala, see yourself in a life that you set in motion around the one ordained from above. Something to meditate upon"
"Quite a contrast to his later films, here, Zhang Yimou orchestrates a quiet toned but extremely deadly film. There is not a speck of the glamour from films like House of Flying Daggers, and Hero. It was the success of this which probably earned him the respect and funding for those big budget films. Raise the Red Lantern, has a Kurosawa quality to it; very slow, very dramatic and very thought provoking.Set around the beginning of the 20th century, The film is about the conflict between four concubines in the massive household of a Chinese lord. Every night he chooses to sleep with a different one. Red lanterns are lit and hung outside the room of whichever he chooses. The story is told from Gong Li's perspective - she has is the latest concubine. The tension is all about the competition among the women for the only power they can have - access to the lord.Raise the Red Lantern, has a very barren feeling, and with so many wide establishing shots, this truly does resemble a Kurosawa design. The story rumbles with a grim ambiance and hardly ever escalates to an overly-dramatic scale. Zhang deliberately keeps things fairly distant and uncertain, and concludes the story on a dramatic and disturbing note. Such qualities of storytelling are rare, making Raise the Red Lantern a great film to see."
"After her father's death, Songlian is forced into a marriage at the young age of 19 to a master who already has three other wives. As Songlian moves into the master's mansion, there is a sense of jealousy along with conflict within her and the other three wives. The competition for the master's attention becomes tough as Songlian will soon find out. Songlian never seems to be happy throughout the whole film. I don't think I've ever recalled a scene where she even smiled other than the time she got drunk. She does not even wear a wedding dress on the day of her wedding with the master. All she wears is a school uniform. By her wearing this outfit, the audience can get a feeling that Songlian is unhappy about her marriage with the master. Hoping to get the master's attention back after cutting the second wife's ear, Songlian made a statement claiming that she is pregnant. The pregnancy becomes false when Yan'er discovers blood on the white pants of Songlian meaning that she had her period and could not have been pregnant. Things are just going to get worst from there on. Ever since Songlian moved into the mansion, everything bad has been going on. This film revolves around a 19-year-old college student forced into a marriage. It has a great storyline to it along with the costumes to abstract the backgrounds. The director's camera angles were great in this. This is one of the best Chinese films I've seen. I would give this film a rating of 8 out of 10 and highly recommend people to go and watch it."
"Raise the Red Lantern directed by Zhang Yimou is the perfect testament to the harsh realities women had to face during the 1920's in China. Zhang Yimou offers a glimpse into the time period of concubines and shows the story of our main protagonist, Songlian. Songlian is first portrayed as an independent young woman who has more than enough education women need during the 20's in China. Zhang Yimou develops the story of Songlian to show that no concubine can survive being independent without facing the consequences. Songlian is put through many obstacles and learns that obedience is number one in the concubine lifestyle after witnessing the execution of the third wife. Raise the Red Lantern shows the different side of being a concubine in China, which is the life of loneliness and distance from the outside world that concubines must lead.Zhang Yimou's direction in Raise the Red Lantern is the true star of the movie. Yimou's constant use of long shots is employed to convey the sense that everything is kept secret in this lifestyle. Yimou's use of color to make the scenery gray is used to show that this is a mundane lifestyle and that there is no getting out. The director's strongest message during the movie was with the third wife when the fourth wife came to watch her sing. The beautiful red kimono against the gray backdrop of the houses showed that these concubines do have souls and personalities outside of their duties as concubines, but as soon as the third wife saw Songlian, she quickly took off the red kimono showing that she must now obey and hide her true self. Yimou accomplished his task of showing the oppressive lives that these women must live and through the use of Songlian he showed that there is no way out.The only flaw in Raise the Red Lantern was the acting. Songlian did not convey much feeling and as the protagonist this was a mistake. The third and second wives were extremely good in playing their parts and showed their secret attempts to keep a hold of their true personalities. Although the acting was not much to rave about, Zhang Yimou created a beautiful film and in-depth look into the lackluster lives of concubines."
"This film is a display of art by straight lines, red colors and architecture. This is what impresses a lot of viewers (and me too). But I would like to add another aspect, the genuine tragedy of three women carrying love, illusions, passions and expectations. The sad fate of Songlian touches everyone today, yet only a century ago this was reality in most of the world. This film shows culture and traditions very little known to us (in the Western World), and still there is the universal problem of equality for women. That's why the story of Songlian's maid, Nan'er, affected me even more. Not only was she a woman, but a servant to another woman; the lower of the lowest. The scene where Songlian unveils her in her apartment and the subsequent quarrel is one of the most touching film scenes I know. The character of the third wife is ambiguous. Having regained the husband's approval, and dating another man, she can't conceal her jealousy towards Songlian. Jealousy for what reason? 'Raise the red lantern' is a document of a time and a culture forgotten by most, but, as other events in history, has to be reminded of."
"Zhang Yimou's ""Raise the Red Lantern"" is an extraordinary achievement. Like Truffaut's ""The 400 Blows"" alerting the cinematic world to the rising of the French New Wave, Yimou's film serves as fair warning to all that the best films in the world are now coming out of Asia.No, I'm not overstating it.In 1920s China, 19-year-old Songlian (Gong Li) is sent to the home of a feudal nobleman to become his fourth wife. While the servants treat her as a princess, it doesn't take Songlian long to realize that she is trapped in a gilded cage and that her life, and the lives of all around her, now revolve around the whims of one very selfish man.Songlian dreams of what her life could have been had she been allowed to finish her education. The third wife dreams of what her life could have been had marriage not ended her opera career. The second wife dreams of what her life could have been had she been able to give the Master a son. And the female servants dream of how wonderful life must be to live as one of the Master's wives.Yimou films the story with an astonishing beauty, giving even a scene of deadly violence (mercifully hidden from the camera) a gorgeous look. Yimou is also very aware of his leading actress's incredible beauty and he coaxes more expressions from Gong Li's face than it would seem one person is capable of making.If you have any hesitations about viewing a subtitled film, put them aside and allow yourself to be taken on one of the most wonderful  cinematic journeys you will ever travel."
"A marvelous, beautiful film with stunning cinematography. The story which takes place in 1920s China is about four concubines. The wives which all live in separate houses must compete for the affections and privileges of the master in accordance with his customs. Jealousy abounds between the wives and the scheming keeps tensions high. Each night a lantern is lit in favor of whom the master will be with. Shortly afterwards all the lanterns of that wife's home and courtyard are also lit and the privileges begin. Although they are wives they are treated like well cared for prisoners. Each having servants and their own space.The first wife and eldest is more like a mother to the others and has the experience and right to make important decisions. The second wife is quiet and reserved but calculating on the inside. The third wife is spoiled and openly displays her dislike for the others. The fourth wife in new and must learn the customs and rules of the master. The film is exhilarating and has a surprising climax. The film is subtitled in English but it is nicely paced so you are not constantly reading or trying to keep up with a lot of dialogue. Nominated for an academy award as best foreign film and although it did not win this is still one great must see film. In fact it is less like a movie and more like a work of art."
"""Raise the Red Lantern"" is a rousing and inspirational film in which Xiang Yimou perfectly captures the essence of feminism. The red lantern is an interesting symbol for Yimou's theme of feminism because the color red can be associated with blood, and thus both death and birth. When Songlian raises the red lantern on her wedding night, it is both the death of her old life, as a student, and the birth of her new life, as a concubine. The symbol of birth is also present in the lighting of the lanterns in the house of the pregnant wife. The symbol of the lantern itself is also an important prop for Yimou's purpose. His purpose is to create a sense of urgency for the feminist cause while maintaining the extremes to which we're influenced by the patriarchy and thus the apparent impossibility of destroying that influence. By making a lantern, a common symbol of hope and light, central to the story, Yimou suggests hope for feminism while still surrounding the lanterns by the house, a symbol of the patriarchy.
Li Gong's performance as Songlian and the technical direction of this film are spectacular but, almost 30 years later, I can see room for improvement. This film has fewer spoken lines than most other films, and where Yimou can't use words to rebel against the master, the third wife's Chinese opera expresses the pain and anger of the four wives. Meishan is the wife whom the house kills, and Yimou's choice to play her opera, hauntingly and painfully, before as well as after she dies, creates a sense of women's eternal subordination and helplessness. The cinematography of the film is superb, especially at Meishan's death. Up until Meishan's death, the cinematography physically traps Songlian in the dark walls of the house, never capturing any sunlight, and any sky that does appear is monotone with the rest of the frame. At Meishan's death, we see treetops and other buildings for the first time, and half the screen is sky, as if pain and anger are the key to freedom, if Songlian could only see past the blinding snow, another symbol of the patriarchy. As a very serious actress, Li Gong plays the role of Songlian particularly well, especially as she goes insane in the eyes of everyone around her. Her performance as she creates an illusion of Meishan's ghost is particularly stirring, because she is able to use just expressions and movements to show that she is not insane but has seen the truth about the house and its master at last. Some might think this film turns into a little too much of a soap opera near the end, but I think it perfectly complements the rising climatic action and adds depth."
"10 stars: Raise the Red Lantern: One of the Best Films of All Time There is a very short list of the best Chinese films of all time. In my book ""The Best 150 Chinese Films of All Time"", there are a dozen films made by Zhang Yimou listed in the top 150. That is an unbelievable achievement. It means Zhang Yimou, easily the greatest director in Chinese Cinema history, accounted for almost 10% of the greatest films ever made in China. Raise the Red Lantern and Farewell, My Concubine are two of those films. This film, Raise the Red Lantern, refers to the signal a rich husband would give for which wife or concubine he wanted for that evening. The movie begins the same way as Red Sorghum, with a wedding procession, but then deviates wildly from that film. It is extremely difficult for any camera shot to make Gong Li look dowdy, but Zhang was a master of downplaying both Gong Li's sexy body, and her God-awful natural beauty; no easy task. As the newest wife, the Gong Li character is pampered in every possible way. Only the finest clothes, food, and surroundings are provided for her; and her servants do everything for her as well. Naturally, she becomes the favorite of the master of the house (what idiot would not make her the favorite?). A recurring theme in several Zhang films and Gong Li roles was the helplessness of Chinese women in a totally patriarchal society in China. Men were always in complete control, and women had only their bodies to negotiate for any power within a relationship. This is an underlying principle that millions of modern-day women can empathized with. Ultimately, just like in real life, a younger, equally beautiful woman comes along to become the next wife, and the red lantern goes out for Gong Li, as the younger woman now becomes the favorite. Millions of women can commiserate with this situation as well. This is a Zhang Yimou masterpiece, and one of his best. Not to be missed."
"This is a Chinese soap opera centered around the ""fourth mistress"" of a man, the three other mistresses, life at the place where they live and a servant girl of the fourth mistress.As I have found with most Asian films, it's nicely photographed with pretty colors but - in this instance - after awhile it's too much of the same. Perhaps that was because all the scenes take place in and just outside of this big house. They take place either in a couple of the rooms, the courtyard or the roof. There is no new scenery after the first half hour.The women, several of whom were very young and pretty, spend much of the time squabbling among themselves. It's not a memorable film."
"Now, 20 years later, I finally throw in my two bits.This is fine, fine, cinematic storytelling: As great as anything Fellini ever did even in his earlier, narrative-focused work.This is a film about the greatest tragedy of sexism: That women get relegated to a role as a collective screen upon which men project an image, where that image serves to mask the fact that those men still largely don't know who they are.And the ""mistresses"" of the film comprise a bestiary of responses to this particular type of subjugation, each a peculiar species of character perversion: Playing the prim and proper grand dame; fawning on the oppressor while engaging in subterfuge with adversaries; having her cake and eating it too. In the end, I figured it out: These women could be parts of a unitary woman, one who feels the sting of being subject to such a bald, witless systemic hypocrisy.Apparently, the film got shelved by the Chinese state apparatus for a spell, 'til cooler, more open-minded heads prevailed. Sure: It's a film about abuse of power. So? Who's afraid of Virginia Wolff?"
"I first watched this movie when I was young (10 yrs old) with my father who enjoyed art films. I remember it being very captivating. I didn't understand the many levels and issues this film addressed but it completely held my attention even as a child.I saw this film again (23 now) as a woman and I am so moved by this film.For me personally, I feel it addresses a very major issue;The fight for the attention of men that women all over the world understand. Many of us are so caught up with looking desirable and obsessed with finding/""keeping"" that man so much so that we leave the fate of the world in the hands of men (in general).We let them run the world while we fiddle with our makeup and alter our bodies to fit their standards while they make the important decisions that govern our lives. We also let the pursuit of mens' attentions drive rifts between us that create jealousy and hate. Sometimes I wonder why this is so? We aren't afraid of work and we are certainly as clever as men =)Every time I see this movie, it reminds me to be loving to my fellow women and stop playing bitchy mind games that we consciously and unconsciously play and direct my focus on more important things.Yes, I do believe that we can change this and I will start by not being a part of that game that we have all been a part of at some point in our lives."
"""Raise the Red Lantern"" shows that an art film can be entertaining- at least I thought it was, because it kept my attention. Of course there are very slow moments, but so what? This film is great! A very intense drama, with a strange and impressing ending. This one deserved to win the Oscar as best foreign film.A must-see! Find it at the video store and rent it!"
My Rating : 1/10I went mad just like the Fourth Mistress does towards the end - it's a pretty terrible and bizarre kind of story which is too long and pointless.Not a movie I would recommend.
"I saw this only once when I was a young woman. I found it riveting and terrifying.I am not going to try to repeat what everyone else said, but I want to say something else.When I reflected on the movie, I thought about the order of the marriages. The first wife was the master's same age. She must have been a beautiful local girl at them time of her wedding, but nothing ""special"". Now she is an old woman resigned to eternally live in the shadows. She tries to make the best of her situation. She has no illusions about how things are, unlike her replacement sisters who are still vying for ""love"" from the master. Wife #1 seems aloof, but she knows the rules and she bids her time, like a cat. When she gets her chance to strike, she does not hesitate to kill.The second wife was younger, a cute, chubby face, and always laughing. She must have been a young, fun, exciting diversion from the first wife when he married her. But eventually, he got bored with her and moved on.The next wife was a famous opera singer. The master must have grown rich by the time he married her; and she was glamorous, exotic, sought after and talented. Who wouldn't want to marry a star? He must have convinced her that since she was marrying a rich man, and she was so admired, that he would ""love"" her forever. Then he married her and put his new jewel in a box, only to be played with when he felt like it.Now comes our protagonist: very young, very beautiful and educated. She is not in love, but only in it for the financial reasons room and board. Her stepmother took her dreams of an independent life and turned her into a whore. The master said something about an ""educated woman being different"". Apparently, with each wife, he was always looking for something new and different. But the bottom line is this: she is just another sex object for him. I remember first wife said, ""How old are you? 19? Such sins"". She knows her husband is just a selfish, sex-crazed, dirty old man.And then there is the slave girl: why bother MARRYING her when . . . .At the end of the movie: Wife #5: a child. Now I know why #1 said, ""Such sins"". How will this child survive in this deadly house? I recommended this movie."
"Raise the Red Lantern is a film directed by Zhang Yimou which is an adaptation of the novel Wives and Concubines by Su Tong. The film deals with a number of issues and handles them with meticulous craftsmanship. It is a masterpiece in every aspects ranging from storyline to technical sophistry. This review will be focused on various necessary aspects of the film but there will be no commentary over it as an adaptation. The discussion will cover its plot, characters, technical elements, sound and theme.The setting of the film is 1920s China. Songlian (Gong Li) is an educated girl who had to marry a rich feudal patriarch because of her mother's will when her father dies. She therefore becomes the fourth mistress of the family that maintains traditions and its orthodoxy rigorously. She finds herself within a suffocating confinement. Her sole focus is narrowed down to get the attention of the master likewise the other ""sisters"". Interestingly; along with physical satisfaction, the wives' charm in the house seems to rest on getting the foot massage which is given to the particular wife with whom the master will be 'spending' his night. Songlian is a quick learner who starts tricking and fooling other ""sisters"" just like the way they do. She builds a good relationship with the second wife (Cao Cuifen) and does not quiet get along with the third one. With a number of twisting discoveries, Songlian keeps on gaming until she uncovers something grave in a state of drunkenness in her 20th birthday.The character of Songlian is the most craftily characterized one in the film. While other characters, especially second and third wives are seen to be only fussily engaged in grabbing the master's attention, Songlian projects an amazing amount of sentimentality, sensibility, anger and calculability. Songlian's maid is also an important character who is characterized to a credible degree. Within a confinement of rules, traditions and orthodoxy; Songlian and her maid have expressions that are praiseworthy. The master and First wife's son Feipu plays a precise but significant role. Other characters serve up to their demand of the plot. This is one of the very few films where there are no unnecessary characters. Moreover, the acting is superb.The film has brilliant editing and incredibly meticulous cinematography. Kudos must be given to the cinematographer Yang Lun and Zhao Fei. The cinematography is so amazingly mathematical that it turns out to be a work of art. The precision reminds of Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin and some of its legendary cinematography. Editing is very smooth and the superimposition in the last sequence are also uncannily perfect. The screenplay deserves a bow. It's literally hard to find any flaws in the technical sector of the film.The film uses very little sound. The songs of the ""Third Mistress"" are enchanting. The introductory music which is repeated several times in the film is very purposive and upholds the stereotypical fact that it is a Chinese film.The film deals with a number of themes. There is something graver than mere sentimentality because it must not be forgotten that this film was banned by the Chinese Government. The film has all the dramatic themes necessary to make a film attractive. But the main theme of the film serves as a critique of Confucianism that means it is a satire of the theory of a good family. Songlian's condition by the end of the film can be a critical psychoanalytical reading.To be conclusive, the film is a must watch for both film critics and movie-goers. The film critics will surely find this to be a soothing experience. On the other hand, movie-goers will surely have a good time."
"The film is a beautifully crafted and richly detailed feat of consciousness-raising and serious drama with the verve of a good soap opera. Against her family's wishes, a teenage girl (Gong Li) in 1920s China becomes the fourth wife of a rich merchant, and finds herself competing for her husband's good will against his other wives.Raise The Red Lantern is an enthralling examination of a male-dominated society; director Zhang Yimou uses colour schemes, meticulously symmetrical compositions and stylised interiors to evoke an inflexible society. It is a film of ravishing formal beauty - to the extent that its look threatens to soften the ugly aspects of the society it depicts."
"""Raise the Red Lantern"" took me three nights to watch, not because it was a dull story, but because my ocular senses had to recover from the glory of each of the scenes. What may have been lacking in story depth, made up for in visuals as this story of a concubine in China desperately adjusts to a life she was not eager to step into. Handed limited options, Songlian (the fourth mistress) is handed the keys to an elaborate castle, one full of red lanterns, foot massages, lavish food, and a maid to wait on her hand and foot. Alas, not all is as perfect as it may seem, with three other mistresses under one roof (coupled with a scored maid) - the events get dramatic, mistresses pine for time with the ""Master"", and the hardships of living in this culture become clear as ""Raise the Red Lantern"" couples history, fiction, and amazing visuals to weave an important story to the screen. Admittedly, I was skeptical at first - a two hour film that deals with an archaic tradition that may focus more on the dramatics than an actual compelling story, but I was wrong. ""Raise the Red Lantern"" proves itself Oscar-worthy (alas, overshadowed by the ""Mediterraneo"" win) and coincidentally extremely passionate and watchable nearly 17 since it's release.Boasting big sets, amazing decor, and a taboo subject, ""Raise the Red Lantern"" pulls the viewer in with its stark realism, the elaborate nature of women in China in the 1920, and a score that is both haunting and refreshing. The smallest of scenes will pull you further into the film than imagined, and the subtle-ness of evil in contrast to women vying for the attention of one man is done in such a way that the emotions of sympathy, anger, frustration, and jealousy will boil up within. This is a movie that doesn't speak often, but says quite a bit through imagery and small actions. There is one scene in particular that was filmed gorgeously by director Yimou Zhang, which involves the discovery and subsequent downfall of Songlian's way of life. The long shot followed by her transformation was invigorating to say the least. Coupled with the stark beauty of winter, there is no question as to why this film has been lauded by critics and viewers alike. There is something unique about the way Zhang creates a sense of claustrophobia by keeping us in two-three rooms, yet each scene is fresh and new - that sense of stale surroundings is never present. This is a beautiful film, yes, but the acting is like more icing on the cake. Li Gong does a impressive job as Songlian, as we see her from the early excitement/nervousness about this change in her life, to seeing what tricks need to be pulled, to that question of sanity. This makes you revert back to the beginning of the film to wonder if something else had been missed. Your perception of Songlian will revert backwards as you attempt to see who she really is. Has she found a life, or merely unable to cope with the realities of the surroundings? Given the power of Songlian, it is tough to see anyone else stealing her glory, but Yan'er nearly does. Watch this subtle performance - as the maid scorned by another lover - she nearly steals every scene. Between these two, it is a delicate balance.With the beauty of the scenes and the acting, it is nearly a perfect film, but what pulls me back from applauding every minute of this film is the overall story behind ""Raise the Red Lantern"". There were just these moments where Zhang used the scenery to fill time, where the story itself was merely an hour and twenty minutes of physical story, but the eloquence of the background allowed for more. Don't get me wrong, the story is important - but perhaps not two-hours worthy.FILM: The film itself is breathtaking. Watch this with someone or alone on a snowy night. It challenges the mind and opens your heart to a part of history that needs to be discussed. I was reminded of our modern issues with polygamy, and how this Chinese tradition echos that ideal.VISUAL: MGM's release of this film (up converting on my Blu player) is immaculate. If this ever finds a true Blu release, it will easily be added to the collection. The reds are solid, the whites of the snow are delicate, and the long shots of the Master's villa nearly transforms you from the couch to the screen. It is easy to get lost in ""Raise the Red Lantern"" purely by the cinematography. The 2.35 widescreen is amazing, no matter which size screen you are working with.SOUND: Brilliant as well. The bold oriental sounds permeate through the visuals, giving two of our senses a crisp dose of intensity. The Chinese/Mandarin language with the English subtitles work to create the language, without leaving big gaps or being too overbearing. It nearly felt like a 5.1 surround, but it isn't specified. If it were 2.0, it was impressive.EXTRAS: Lacking. The only downturn to this film. There is nothing that builds the character of the film - i.e. how it was made, director or cast feelings, etc., etc. - I think the only thing we have it a preview. Rather sad considering the immaculate nature of this film.Overall, I was very pleased with this film. ""Raise the Red Lantern"" is one of those films that you shouldn't judge by the cover. It seems like another drab historical film, but in the end it is nothing but rewards to both the senses and the mind. Despite the lacking features, I am excited about adding this film to the collection, and look forward to the other films Yimou Zhang has released.Grade: **** out of *****"
"This is absolutely my favorite film. I have only seen it twice in my life, but I have never found a film so visually appealing, the cinematography is exquisite, the artistic use of color breathtaking. This is a heartbreaking yet inspiring film. I have and always will recommend Raise the Red Lantern to everyone. It has had that much of an effect on me. This was the first foreign language film I had ever seen, and it was one of those life changing experiences. I grew up a lot just watching it, and I came to understand and appreciate life just a bit more. I hope that many of you will take the time to watch this film; it is worth the time and effort of reading the subtitles."
"Zhang Yimou's film shows how a genius in one medium (film) can transform a work by a genius in another medium: Su Tong, whose story inspired the film. Su Tong's novella focuses on Lotus (Songlian in the movie) from her arrival as the unexpected Fourth Mistress to Master Chen to her ultimate madness. Su Tong's story, although told in third person, is nonetheless centered on its main character. We initially encounter her on her arrival at the Chen household, when she is mistaken for a poor relation.  We know at once that this Fourth Mistress has not received the arrival honors her three predecessors enjoyed. (The film represents this by showing her journey on foot to Chen's compound.). Problems with the young servant girl who attends her are also featured in Zhang's film. The movie invents actions and episodes that clarify events in the source story. Songlian's feigned pregnancy, for example, has no parallel in Su Tong's tale, although the novella does hint that the Fourth Mistress' status in the troubled household depends either on keeping Chen's sexual interest (in the story, he wanes into impotence) or producing a male heir. The movie uses this invention to conflate plot points in the story, notably Songlian's revenge on Yan'er, the servant girl who loathes her. In the story, Swallow (the servant) is forced by Lotus to eat a tissue soiled with Songlian's menstrual blood, which the Fourth Mistress regards as a charm Swallow created to curse her. In the movie, it is Yan'er's revelation to the Second Mistress that precipitates her fate when Songlian punishes her by forcing her to kneel for days in the freezing courtyard. Also, the movie moves to its climax when Songlian, while drunk, reveals that the Third Mistress is sexually involved with a doctor who regularly visits her; Lotus, in the story, knows this, but does not reveal the adultery at all, even though she does get drunk at a key point in the story. Zhang's film brilliantly conflates the story and invents episodes that amplify and - for Western viewers - simplify what Su Tong presents mainly through his focus on the increasingly fragile mind of his main character as well as through images that don't lend themselves easily to film drama. Zhang also invented the ritual of the red lanterns, which serve as a structuring device in the film as well as a correlative of each woman's standing in the Chen household. The lanterns, plus the division of the film into seasons (Songlian's one year in the household), realize on film a pattern in Su Tong's story. That story remains worth reading, if only because by reading it one can truly appreciate the changes Zhang made and the reasons for these changes. Su Tong's story is brilliant; Zhang's film is even better."
"This has been on my watchlist for ages and now I finally get to watch this for secret santa pick. I guess I love asian cinema. Beautiful score with beautiful singing. Great cinematography and camera movement, I mean every frame is piece of art. Story is so interesting and emotions are real. You already know how they feel before they even say something because you can tell all by expresions on their faces and that's why I love asian cinema in general. I love small details and symbolism in their words and objects. They don't put everything in front of you like most of Hollywood movies, they make you think and understand. The Favourite wishes to be Raise the Red Lantern."
"Zhang Yimou has a rare, brilliant gift of telling historical events , both ancient and newest, without any apparent effort. He gives his narratives maximum historical relevance. When referring to current realities, he did not forget for a moment that the past continued to influence key political, ideological, socio-economic, cultural aspects of the present. The fourth production of the master was an adaptation of the novel ""Wives and Concubines"" (1990) by Su Tong - a classic of modern Chinese prose, particularly indicative of that respect towards history. The script by Zhen Ni and the finished film really aroused the keen interest of censors in the People's Republic of China, which is explainable by the fact that Taiwanese producer and entrepreneur Qiu Fushen provided substantial financial support. Fortunately officials and producers had the tact and artistic flair to, following the restrictions - exclude the elements that might create a basis for an ""undesirable"" allegory, so they did not quench the essence of the idea. The picture caused powerful resonance at the Venice International Film Festival (though the Golden Lion went to the Russian Nikita Mikhalkov's Urga - Territory of Love, a good but minor movie in comparison). It has rightfully taken an honor place among the best productions of the last decade of the 20th century."
"Chinese auteur Zhang Yimou's fourth feature, Venice's Silver Lion winner and an Oscar BEST FOREIGN LANGUAGE FILM nominee, RAISE THE RED LANTERN, first and foremost, emblazons Zhang's indubitable sense of form as a cinematic aesthete by curtailing the whole shebang within the perimeter of a palatial residence (the Qiao Family compound near Pingyao, Shanxi Province) in the Warlord Era China of the early 20th Century, and vetting women's tragic life immured inside a feudal prison with a fine-tooth comb.Songlian (Gong Li), a 19-year-old college-dropout, marries into the wealthy Chen Family as the fourth wife (or the third concubine), and soon is embroiled into the harem's backdoor maneuver, validated by the lantern-lightening ritual vouchsafed by Master Chen (Ma Jingwu) - whose face is never shown in close-up, a bold generalization pregnant with Zhang's tacit swipe at the draconian patriarchy's clutches - to indicate which wife he intends to spend the night with and is concomitant with privileges like sensual foot massage and preferential culinary options vested to the cherry-picked one.With the exception of Chen's first wife, the scraggly Yuru (Jin Shuyuan), who is long in the tooth and has become philosophical towards her long-gone heyday, the quotidian contest revolves around Songlian, Meishan (He Saifei), the third wife, a cosseted former Peking opera star who sub rosa engages in an illicit affair with the family doctor, and Zhuoyun (Cao Cuifen), the second wife, a Buddha-faced, scorpion-hearted figure, who befriends Songlian with an ulterior motive to exact. As the surrogate of audience, Songlian enters Chen's household with ""those who know nothing fear nothing"" assertiveness that we all obligatorily root for her ascendancy among the medieval hierarchy, but as she realizes before long, those backhanded plotting is nothing but futile attempt, those wives are merely disposable accessories of their husband, vessels of procreation. She can neither deign to Zhuoyun's total submission to this polygamous anomaly nor become rebellious enough like Meishan, who dares to cross that dangerous line to stake her claim as an individual being, in the event, assailed by the collective onslaught of guilt, despair, disillusion and shock in the wake of witnessing a brutal murder, she is no longer compos mentis. In the byplay, the friction between she and her mulish maid Yan'er (Kong Lin), who harbors a pipe dream of becoming her master's mistress and holds a none-too-subtle grudge over Songlian, is even more tragic because what adds insult to injury is the insuperable chasm caused by classism, that completely antagonizes those two girls of similar age, on the strength of false hope and mean-spirited vengeance. A high-octane Gong Li is par excellence to headline this sublimely arranged female-oriented melodrama, exhibiting a staggering disintegration of Songlian's headstrong persona through smoldering emotional shifts, and rounds out the show with a bang in the coda: business as usual in the family's fiefdom, only she has devolved into a living-ghost perennially and obliviously wandering the courtyard, seems to apprise her unwitting successor of a buried tragedy, which like as not will repeat again. Among the supporting players, He Saifei impresses with her stupendous opera posture and a friend-or-foe intrigue that occasions a precious if elusive sense of solidarity that is essential to the film's feminist slant; on the opposite of the gamut, veteran actress Cao Cuifen, intriguingly excels in exemplifying the artificiality of sororal rapport.It goes without saying that RAISE THE RED LANTERN owes its appreciable renown as much to its performers as those behind the camera, namely, the rigidly-framed, chromatically stunning cinematography from Zhao Fei and Yang Lun that falls in line with a unique color scheme out of Zhang's ingenious conception, and the aural pleasure engendered by the oriental strains masterly composed by Zhao Jiping along with shrill Chinese opera snippets, honing the trenchant strength of this benightedness-censuring, universally allegorical tale that judiciously scrutinizes womanhood in its dead center."
I loved this film. It flows like reading a beautiful book. Well directed and perfectly acted.
"Perhaps I've conditioned myself to some of director Yimou Zhang's later films, because this movie had none of the appeal that I was expecting. Not that I was looking for a colorful and exciting display of martial arts, I can get that anytime. But the story line here was frustratingly static and virtually relegated to a single location inside the fortress of a wealthy Chinese land owner. And unless my DVD copy of the movie was somehow degraded, the early portions of the picture had a scratchy quality to it, almost like a 1920's silent film. But maybe that's just an outlier I experienced.The story itself is compelling in it's own way, and the use and symbolism of the lanterns lends an ethereal quality to the Master's choice of bedtime partners each evening. I probably should have expected the infighting and power play of the four 'mistresses' conspiring against each other, however I don't know how any of them thought they could get away with their schemes. Perhaps that's why the oldest First Mistress (Shuyuan Jin) managed to keep herself mostly out of the fray, having been around the longest and realizing she was no longer a preferred 'wife'. The question of how long Songlian (Li Gong) thought she could affect the ruse of a pregnancy was brought up but never really answered. Perhaps she was going mad well before witnessing Meishan's (Saifei He) execution.Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the story is the virtual absence of The Master (Jingwu Ma), a shadowy presence for the most part who's commands and directions are handled off screen or in dim lighting so as not to intrude on the machinations of the four mistresses. I was also taken aback by what appeared to be a voodoo type of doll used by Songlian's servant girl Yan'er (Lin Kong), to call upon the spirits to demean the lady she served. Even with all of that though, I didn't find the movie to be that compelling over all, and if I were to offer a recommendation. I'd say stick with Yimou Zhang's films of two decades later - ""Hero"" (2002), ""House of Flying Daggers"" (2004), or ""Curse of the Golden Flower"" (2006). Watch any of those and 'Red Lantern' pales by comparison."
"Although the strong rhythm of the first half of the script did not run through the whole time, the excellent scheduling, photography and sound effects finally maintained the tension of the film.
After all, the main plot still didn't break through the comfort zone of a typical Chinese realism, in contrast to the metaphorical and emotional details that spill over through the suffocating atmosphere. Of course, the structure of story, color application and role shaping are all achieved with excellent and appropriate execution effect."
"Raise the Red Lantern is masterful piece of film history.A bleak tale of sexual subjugation and ruthless scheming in a single opulent household in 1920s China, Raise the Red Lantern portrays four women locked in struggle for attention from the master of the house, who every day favours one of his concubines with special honour of spending a night with him. And as usual among the hereditary nobility, the highest achievement is pregnancy resulting a male child.The tense plot is perfected by the backdrop of suffocating ancient mansion built out of dull bricks and adorned expensively with etchings and drapery, and staffed with servants. The watcher barely gets a glimpse of the outside world as if nothing even existed outside the walls of the compound where the women are imprisoned in concubinage. And almost as faceless is the master himself, whose face we never see in close up shot.Cinematography and set building stand out as excellent, with stark reds of the drapery and lanterns, contrasting with the muted greys of the mansion itself, later covered by a blanket of snow."
"The story itself is a common clichés found in the 80s and 90s Hong Kong made serial TV dramas but which usually tells about royal families instead. Zhang Yimou and the movie's creators nicely simplify those settings into the mid-level social class of a wealthy man .But despite this simplification, the intrigue gets even more focused and emphasized. The feel of the artsy movie with lots of long shot zooms and still moments instead supports the drama and made the movie's pace really enjoyable. I felt that the two-hour duration was nicely bearable since the movie piece in its puzzle pieces nicely and still keeps the ending quite unpredictable despite the story contains a lot of clichés about harem and the intrigue inherent in it. The acting overall is a little bit above standard. Gong Li did okay in her performance here although she really had to work more on her expressions."
"Songlian (Gong Li) is 19 year old having spent 6 months in university. After her father's death, she's berated by her stepmother into finding a rich man to marry. She is relegated to be the fourth wive to the powerful Chen Zuoqian. Each wive lives in her own identical separate house within the large compound. The wives scheme to keep the attention of the master. Each night, a red lit lantern is placed in front of the house of the wive that Chen intends to spend the night with. Songlian is given Yan'er as her maid who hates her and is having relations with the master. The first wive is ancient and resigned. The second wife seems friendly on the surface. The third wife is an opera singer.The cinematography is beautiful as well as the exotic setting. Li Gong is one of the most expressive actresses ever to come out of China. She creates a character that is not a simple damsel in distress. She is caught in a machine of institutionalized desperation. This is one of great movies that ushers in a new era of Chinese filmmaking."
"A young woman (Gong Li) becomes the fourth wife of a wealthy lord, and must learn to live with the strict rules and tensions within the household.""Raise the Red Lantern"" has been distributed on VHS, Laserdisc and DVD by numerous different distributors, with many coming under criticism for their poor quality. You absolutely must see this film in decent quality, because it is the color that sells the picture. (Sure, the plot helps, but this is a beautiful film.) The Razor Digital Entertainment DVD is said to be particularly bad. The MGM DVD from 2007 is quite good, but this is still a picture that would benefit from a new transfer (and maybe some special features).Ebert compares this movie to the Japanese film ""Woman in the Dunes"" (1960), and ranks it among his ""Great Movies""."
"Zonglian is a woman forced to drop out of college and marry a wealthy older lord when her father dies. But she is merely a fourth wife who must live in a house, as does her three ""sisters"". The man chooses one of four wives each night, and red lanterns are lit above the respective wife's house. This causes the wives to resent each other and compete for his attentions, and even Zonglian's maidservant plots against her.After Zonglian gets herself disgraced by making the false claim that she had been impregnated by the lord, she forms a sort of friendship with the formerly jealous third wife, who admits having an affair with the family doctor. But things get even worse when Zonglian is tricked into admitting the secret.China was never a happy place under Communism, but it certainly wasn't much better before it either."
"Raise the Red Lantern is directed by the well known Chinese director Zhang Yimou. Zhang has created a piece of work that is rich with symbolism. His use of colour and differing camera angles capture the unspoken emotions and atmosphere constantly surrounding the narrative. Raise the Red Lantern reflects on Confucian attitudes and the welfare of women under this regime. Zhang uses cultural tradition to critique the past. While this tradition serves its purpose in the film it must be recognised as a conscious attempt by Zhang to self-orientalise. His use of hyper-real traditions further demonstrates his need to emphasise the exotic and make the film appealing to an international audience. Colour is used throughout the film to create atmosphere, depict emotions and symbolise power. Zhang has a history of using the colour red in his films. In Raise the Red Lantern I believe the colour red is used to symbolise power and also the lack of power. Each evening all the mistresses must line up outside their houses to await the master's choice of who he will spend the night with. The mistress who is chosen is presented with a glowing red lantern at her doorway and the approach to her house is lit by red lanterns. This display of red gives power to one over the many. With the honour associated with being chosen to lie with the master comes power of choice over the other mistresses and servants. The chosen mistress may choose what food is prepared for all, where she will eat it and can demand usually unobtainable services from servants and mistresses alike. In this instance the colour red is a symbol of power for the mistress. In the same instance this colour red can be interpreted as a lack of power for the mistress. The red lantern being presented to the mistress could also represent her powerlessness over choice. She has been chosen by the master to sleep with him; she has no say in this decision and must subject to his will. Yet another reading of this symbol is that of the western notion of a red light representing prostitution. A common symbol of prostitution in the west is having a red light over the doorway and lends to the name ""red light district"". This western understanding of the colour red may have been adopted by Zhang in this film to further its understanding and appeal to western audiences. For when you review the way in which the mistress is chosen, is used as a tool to gratify the man and then left at his discretion, it has many similarities to prostitution. Contrasting the bright colour red is the muted backdrop of subdued hues of Grey. This backdrop creates a sense of melancholy and impending despair. It also highlights the bright red of the lanterns, furthermore emphasising whoever has the lanterns importance and power over the rest. I believe that the lanterns themselves are also very symbolic in the film. The lanterns are the lifeblood of the female characters in the film. When the lanterns are lit the characters have hope and life, when they are out they live in despair. When Songlian is found to have tricked the master about being pregnant her lanterns are not only put out but also covered. This symbolises her hope being quashed, she is from then on ignored by the master, left to live in the muted background and fated to turn mad. Another example of the lantern symbolising hope and life is with Ya'ner . Ya'ner steals lanterns to try and emulate the hope and life that the mistresses enjoy. When Ya'ner is found out she is forced to kneel in the snow while her lanterns are burnt in front of her. This symbolises her hopes, dreams and life being destroyed. She dies after this episode. Raise the Red Lantern is also a critique of the not so distant Confucian society that dominated China for over a thousand years. Zhang focuses his portrayal of Confucian values on the power relationship between genders. Such examples are evident throughout the film. The husband in the film, only ever referred to in the film as ""the master"", is the patriarch and untouchable. The master has four wives/mistresses and has the power to call on any one of them to fulfil his needs. His mistresses have no choice in when or how they are chosen, they are treated as objects not as people. The fact that he is married to all four women and yet they are never referred to as his wives is an example of their lack of power and status. Zhang uses two characteristics common to Fifth generation film makers in his telling of Raise the Red Lantern. Both self-orientalising and hyper-real situations are evident throughout the film. Zhang purposely over exaggerates many of the cultural practices and the extent of their influence. He does this to draw attention and make the film more exotic and enthralling to an international audience. He focuses on the negative and brutal aspects of Confucian society to perpetuate the western belief that Chinese society is brutal and archaic. In his attempt to make the film more exotic he also creates hyper-real customs that he sells as authentic. Key depictions such as the use of the red lanterns, the use of the voodoo doll by the servant and the 'traditional' foot massage are examples of an imagined culture created for the benefit of the viewer. Raise the Red Lantern is a gripping, emotional and vivid critique of Confucian society. It makes use of extensive symbolism to enhance the narrative and further the viewers understanding of key themes. Zhang has focused on gender power relations, in particular the lack of power women were afforded in Confucian society. He has used traditional as well as hyper-real cultural practices to emphasise and highlight the moral miss-comings of Chinese culture and in effect has reinforced western views of cultural supremacy."
"Perhaps I'm just not the right audience for Raise the Red Lantern. I do have an interest in foreign films, even if the budget and production values are only mid-level. And I like intelligent films that teach me something about foreign cultures.But I didn't feel that Raise the Red Lantern went particularly deep into culture. Once the basic premise was set up -- 4 concubines who fight over their shared husband -- the story was a fairly straightforward woman vs. woman in-fighting tale that could have been set in any era at any time.Unfortunately, unlike Anne of Green Gables, or Anna and the King, which has plenty of nasty people but a protagonist you can root for, Raise the Red Lantern didn't present an interesting protagonist. Mostly the leading woman blows up at people and takes self-destructive actions or lets them happen rather than moving the plot forward. There's only so far pity will take me in empathizing with a character. This is similar to how I felt about the film ""The Piano"", with magnificent sets but ugly characters I couldn't bring myself to care about.Who should see this film:-- Those interested in the culture of China of the 1920s, but you may be disappointed.-- Arty people, you really have a racket going in convincing people that boring films are really superb. Keep it up. And by the way, please infiltrate all the newspapers so that regular guys like me have no idea from the professional movie reviews whether a film is great or sucks. That's so helpful.-- Sullen, immature concubines looking for a few pointersI'll give Raise the Red Lantern a 4 out of 10, which is the highest rating I'll give a film I could not watch all the way through. Sorry -- I'm entitled to my opinion and at least I gave reasons!"
"Being forced into a marriage at the age of 19 isn't easy. Gong Li plays Song Lian in ""Raise the Red Lantern"" as the fourth concubine of the master Chen. Having the master's company means Red Lanterns are lit in that wife's courtyard as tradition follows. Pride and power consume the wives as they rival, form alliances, and deceive one another to gain the attention and benefits of the master. The classical and almost depressing set up neatly conveys the battle for the Red Lantern as things get out of control.In just the first few minutes of the movie one can see just how tough China was in the 1920's. Song Lian's father had just died and so she is arranged to marry a 50 year old man, who is wealthy and powerful. Song Lian chooses to marry as she wants to prove her independence to her step mother. She becomes the fourth mistress of his mansion, walking in with her school cloths, once again showing she's the boss of herself. She differs from the other three as being the only educated wife, a rarity for women in China. However, she quickly learns things aren't as they seem in the house. The desire for authority lingers within the house as she is unwelcome by the servant girl, which she herself wanted to be the fourth mistress, first and third mistress. She's even deceived by the second mistress who put a fake smile on. As an immature teenager, pride overwhelms her as she joins the game of gaining the red lantern. The irony of it all is that red, as seen on the lanterns, is a color of luck and happiness, yet the setting is quite depressing with shades of gray and brown. Although this battle for authority and their own self recognition is fought passionately, no mistress is truly happy.One may think this movie is quite boring because of the dullness of setting and the lack of variation of the camera as it is always steady, set in one place at a time. However, there is a lot of significance that can easily be spotted making the viewer chained into the movie. The story is so plausible that one may even put themselves in that situation. It's and entertaining drama which gets three stars out of five for good story line and good acting."
"An astonishing movie!  Beautifully shot, with fantastic performances.  The famous Chinese actress, Gong Li, stars in this movie.  This is a movie about a young woman who marries a wealthy man--a man who already has three wives. Little does she know what life has in store for her, as a result of that marriage.  Being only nineteen years old, she does not know much about life or about people, but she comes to realize that people are not what they appear to be and that there are no guarantees in life.  In particular, she learns that her life as a married woman has become one of strict customs and rules, and that she is surrounded by people plotting against her and each other.  Within the course of just one year, she starts out with a mind-set of hope, but it inevitably becomes a mind-set of resignation.  I was stunned by all of the revelations in the film, and it's shocking to see the effect that each revelation has on the characters.  Certainly, all of the performances were fantastic.  I especially admired the performance of the woman who plays the ""second mistress"".  Her character's role in the movie was the most jaw-dropping of all.  In all, this movie is one of the best foreign-language movies I have ever seen.  Excellent story, performances, and cinematography."
"The Chinese have been making some exquisite films lately and this is one of them. Artistic freedom is ipso facto good. And China is becoming globalized -- they have multiple KFCs and a Delifrance in Shanghai. Coca-cola is not only a carminative but it's liberating too, and surprisingly affordable. This movie is kind of slow going, but it's worth it. The compositions are masterly and all the iconography meticulously ordered. One yearns for big red paper lanterns after watching this. And Gong Li! Her face approaches female perfection. Even that slight inborn pout is endearing. She's a good actress too. All the characters give credible performances. It's a good movie, a pleasure to watch, in all respects. Four wives. I wonder how you can get to be a millionaire in 1920s China."
"This movie is like a piece of westernised Chinese food which added lots of sugar to flatter white people's taste. Unfortunately,it is totally fabricated and make no sense to me as a Chinese. The sugar here is the complicated sexual relationship; whimsical concocted costume,raising the lanterns in the front of mistress is a joke to me ; and slanted eyes main characters, exactly catering the white people's stereotypical view of Asian. I have nothing against director yimou and gong li. As a matter of fact I prefer their other film which called to live. However, if you do not understand Chinese history and China very well you probably do not enjoy this film as you do not know the meaning behind."

"I knew nothing about this Chinese film before reading about it in the book, then I saw critics gave it high praise and full marks, so I hoped for another deserved listed entry, directed by Yimou Zhang (Red Sorghum, Hero, House of Flying Daggers, The Great Wall). Basically set in the 1920s, nineteen-year-old Songlian (Gong Li) is an educated woman, her father has recently died and left the family bankrupt, she is forced to abandons her studies and marry Chen Zuoqian (Jingwu Ma), the wealthy lord of a powerful family, becoming his fourth wife. Arriving at the palace, Songlian is first treated like royalty, given foot massages and brightly lit red lanterns outside his private quarters, but she soon discovers that not all the concubines in the household receive the same luxurious treatment. The master, whose face is never clearly seen, decides on a daily basis which concubine he will spend the night with, whomever he chooses will get lanterns lit, get luxuries, and get the most attention and respect from servants. This causes the four wives to be in competition against each other, continually vying for their husband's attention and affections. The First Mistress, Yuru (Jin Shuyuan), appears to be almost the same age as the master himself, despite giving the master a son years earlier, she is assigned to live her life as forgotten, passed over in favour of the younger concubines. The Second Mistress, Zhuoyun (Cao Cuifen), befriends Songlian, complimenting her youth and beauty, and giving her expensive silk as a gift. She also warns her about the Third Mistress, Meishan (He Saifei), a former opera singer who is spoiled and is unable to cope with no longer being the youngest and most favoured of the master's playthings. As time passes, though, Songlian learns that it is really Zhuoyun, the Second Mistress, who is not to be trusted. Songlian pretends to be pregnant, attempting to gain more attention from the master, and at the same time, trying to actually become pregnant. Zhuoyun, however, is in league with Songlian's personal maid, Yan'er (Kong Lin) who finds blood-covered garments, suggesting Songlian had recently had her period, discovering the pregnancy is a fraud. Family physician, Doctor Gao (Cui Zhigang) is summoned by Zhuoyun, the doctor is secretly having an affair with the Third Mistress. The pregnancy is confirmed to be a sham, the master is infuriated, and orders Songlian's lanterns are covered with thick black canvas bags indefinitely. Songlian blames Yan'er for these events, she reveals to the house that Yan'er's room is filled with lit red lanterns, the maid dreams of becoming a mistress instead of a lowly servant, and suggesting she is in love with the master and may have slept with him. Yan'er is punished by having the lanterns burned while she kneels in the snow, watching as they smoulder, she refuses to apologise and remains in the snow throughout the night, she collapses, falls sick and ultimately dies. Songlian is told of the passing of her former maid, she comes to the conclusion that she is happier in solitude, seeing the competition between the concubines as a useless endeavour. As Songlian retreats further into her solitude, she begins speaking of suicide, reasoning that death is a better fate than being a concubine for the lord. On her twentieth birthday, severely intoxicated and despondent, Songlian inadvertently blurts out the details of the love affair between Meishan and Doctor Gao to Zhuoyun, after the adulterous couple are caught together by Zhuoyun, Meishan is dragged to the room of death, she is hanged to death by the master's servants. Songlian, already agonising the fruitlessness of her life, witnesses the hanging and is emotionally traumatized, after the summer, when the master marries a fifth concubine. In the end, Songlian is seen wandering the compound in her old schoolgirl clothes, she has gone completely insane. Also starring Qi Zhao as the Housekeeper and Chu Xiao as Feipu, the master's eldest son. The leading actress is beautiful and compelling as the vulnerable teenager trying to adjust to living under the strict rules and tensions of the household, I just about got the gist of the story, the red lanterns of the title certainly helped, but this is also full of wonderful use of colour, symbolic compositions, stylised sets, terrific costumes and breathtaking rural landscape, an interesting and worthwhile drama. Very good!"
