"Andrei Rublev (alternately transliterated as Andrei Rublyov) is an epic film created by the Soviet-era director, Andrei Tarkovsky. It was financed and created during a brief cultural thaw in East-West relations, marked by the end of Kruschchev's reign. Within reason, the 205 minute director's cut represents exactly what Tarkovsky wanted in the movie. Unfortunately for Tarkovsky and for us, Kruschev was deposed shortly after filming began, and the 205 minute version was not seen until twenty five years after its creation. The Breszhnev-era censors first trimmed 15 minutes from it, then censors and marketers trimmed more. The shortest known version has been truncated to 145 minutes. Even more sadly, Tarkovsky was never again to get approval for the projects he really wanted to film, or an adequate budget to film the ones that did get approved.Fortunately for us, this movie, recently rereleased in a DVD transferred from a pristine 35mm print, may now be viewed intact, and it is one of the great triumphs of mankind's stay on the planet. It is a masterpiece almost without flaw. The beautiful painterly images follow one another in breathtaking succession. At least three of the eight chapters, if taken individually, could stand alone as separate masterpieces.The ostensible subject is the life of Andrei Rublev, a 15th century monk who is renowned as Russia's greatest creator of religious icons and frescoes. Rublev himself, however, is merely a useful device. Little is known about him, and most of the episodes in the movie come straight from Tarkovsky's imagination of what might have been. Sometimes one must ignore the facts to get to the truth.The movie is not about one talented monk, but about Russia, and Rublev stands in as a useful symbol since he lived in a time when he could personally witness two of the key elements in the development of Russia's unique culture: the growing force of Byzantine Christianity, and the Mongol-Tatar invasions. In addition he was an artist and a thinker, and experienced first-hand the difficulty of following those paths in Russia. Rublev's own inner conflicts allow the filmmaker to illuminate thoughts on the pagan and the sacred, the nature of art, the relationship of the artist to the state, what it means to be Russian, and what it means to be human.It is beautiful, mystical, and profound, but the truly inspiring aesthetics are matched with complete technical wizardry. I simply don't know how some of the shots were created. One I do understand, and stand in awe of, is a continuous single camera shot, just before the church door is breached by Tatar invaders, which involves action in several different locations at multiple elevations as well as the correct timing of hundreds of extras and horses. It makes the first scene of Touch of Evil look like a high school film project.It is a difficult movie to follow. One might liken it to James Joyce's Finnegan's Wake as a work of genius so monumental and complex, and so disdainful of traditional narrative form, that it requires extensive thought and study to understand it. And even after studying it, watching it repeatedly, and reading Tarkovsky's own comments about it, one still finds it opaque in many ways.Tarkovsky was free to create the work of art he wanted, without concern for profit. The original 205 minute cut was also free from outside censorship. He used this freedom to realize his personal artistic vision. There is no other movie like it, and there may never be. Score it 11 out of 10."
"Some historical knowledge will definitely not hurt while watching this film.The medieval society was deeply religious. The church influenced every aspect of people's lives from birth to death and was part of the state. It means religious leaders were as important as rulers.In Russian society men were wearing beards and women covered hairs. Remove a beard from a man or uncover woman's hair and you will humiliate them, they would feel like modern people being undressed in public.Paganism is a form of religion, where people believe in many gods instead of one. The main Russian pagan gods are the goddess of the earth and the god of the sun. Among others - the god of storms and lightning, the mythical young women living in forests and rivers. Despite many centuries of suppression of paganism by authorities some in modern Russia still celebrate the feast of Ivan Kupala (which could be translated as Ivan Gathering) depicted in the movie.Also I have to mention, that Soviet censors told Tarkovski the movie is too cruel. They told him the scene with a burning cow, for example, is absolutely unacceptable. Tarkovski tried to defend the movie. The cow wasn't harmed, was his reasoning. Still the film was cut. The censors knew better what is good and what is not for the viewer.This brings us to what is the message of Tarkovski in this film. There are many messages actually. I'll be telling only about one here, because it is not hidden. It is there, in the dispute between Rublov and Theophanes The Greek. They both are talented, both want to bring people to humanity. Theophanes is tired, he says - common people live in darkness, they are completely consumed by sin and the only way to make them humans is to scare them and punish them. Rublov advocates for love. He says: people live very difficult life, it's amazing how they endure it. We have to love them, to remind them, they are humans, they are Russians. You see, the first is the position of the Soviet system, the second - of Jesus Christ.Me? I'm still sitting on the fence. :)I recommend to watch this movie many times. You will do it without my recommendation though, if you (like me) will not understand everything from the first view and you like to think. The mesmerizing beauty of this movie will help you to return easier. For the first time be prepared for not a cakewalk. There are two things to consider here. One is the cruelty. Though it is absolutely necessary in this film, most of us living in a comfort of modern society are not ready to it. The other is the pace. Often it is a pace of real life. Peace."
"""Andrei Rublev"" is not merely my favourite all-time film; it transcends such pat, by-the-numbers praise.  I have seen ""Andrei Rublev"" three times (twice on the big screen), at three very different points in my life.  Each viewing, it has spoken eloquently and directly, has immersed and fascinated me.  And has moved me with superlative skill and force. Other great movies have entertained me, inspired me, made me think; only ""Rublev"" has palpably altered my outlook on life.Andrei Rublev was a medieval Russian iconographer; the film chronicles his struggle to maintain faith and artistry in a world of immeasurable cruelty and suffering.  Rather than give us a crackerjack plot line with all the proper scene climaxes & paradigm shifts, director Tarkovsky presents us with a world in which we must immerse ourselves; once we are inside, we are confronted with rigorous pain and profound triumph.  The movie is divided into chapters; the final one, involving an orphaned bell-maker's son, is a stunning film-within-a-film that provides a microcosm of the whole movie. That section, if it stood alone, would be my all-time favourite film.Be warned: ""Andrei Rublev"" is SLOW.  You have to slide into it; it's not a flick which dazzles, it is a world which beguiles, and which demands to be inhabited.  Also, there are EXTREMELY difficult scenes to watch--torture and bloodshed abounds.  Watching the Tartar attack on a Russian town is the most painful  experience I've ever had--not just in a cinema, but in life.For those willing to make the gruelling trek, however, ""Andrei Rublev"" is an inspiring, life-affecting experience.  Created under an oppressive Soviet regime (which banned the film for years, recognizing its symbolic commentary on 20th-century Soviet government), the film shows how life can be valuable and even joyful, no matter how much suffering stands in the way.Especially recommended for Tarkovsky fans, Dostoevsky fans, fans of medieval art, and anyone grappling with questions about suffering and human expression."
"He has ruined cinema for me and this is one of the masterpieces that did it. Everytime you see one of his film's you proclaim: ""That's the best picture ever made!"" Which can't be true as that was the last Tarkovsky film you saw. I've seen this one many times at the cinema and is the best three hours of celluloid you're likely to see apart from Solaris, which is Tarkovsky anyway.Tarkovsky wanted to make art that would change people's lives and in this he succeeded. Although his life was troubled and his projects clawed into life randomly from the grip of his film studio bosses, when viewed as a whole they seem to be all part of some great plan that was meant to reach fruition right from the start. He believed that ultimately it is best to do things that deepen one's inner life rather than impoverish it. That may explain why you leave most Hollywood films feeling soiled. There are too many great scenes and moments in this astonishing and monumental work to mention so I won't. Suffice it to say it would have been fascinating to have seen what Tarkovsky would have made had he lived and returned from exile to his homeland. Recent events in Russia and the Balkans make this film even more vital and pertinent today.The trouble is Tarkovsky's films have such extraordinary purity and spiritual depth that no other films seem able to satisfy one in the same way. They seem flat, lifeless and unable to compete. Why watch the let's-pretend-grown ups like Tarantino when you can watch a real grown up? So like I said, Bloody Tarkovsky. He has ruined cinema for me."
"As someone who has seen this movie roughly five times and regards it as the greatest masterpiece in the history of cinema, I find it difficult to fathom how anyone can think that Andrei Rublev is ""slow"" or ""boring"". It is true that it's slow-paced, and perhaps too demanding in its unconventional structure of narrative, but I would prefer this to anything commercial cinema releases in its quest to appeal to as broad a market a possible. In other words, given the choice between a film that treats its audience with respect and gives you enough credit to assume you are willing to sit through roughly three hours of lengthy dialogue and long takes, not to mention some of the most mesmerisingly beautiful visuals ever seen on screen; and one which treats its audience like a demographic that can be appealed to like consumers, not individuals with their own dreams, fears, hopes and aspirations, I know which type of cinema truly bores me.It is often the case that art serves as a mechanism used to comment on social- or individuals ills; rarely however, if at all, does it reflect on itself and its own function to humanity. This is what makes Andrei Rublev a unique and important film, since it addresses the role of the artist in the world. Any questions regarding historical accuracy (or rather lack thereof) towards Rublev's personal life are slightly pointless, since the character is merely used as a vehicle to drive the thematic elements of the narrative. That's not to say that Rublev here is an empty shell, it's simply that Tarkovsky used him as a means to impose his personal views on the subject. Why create art? Does being an artist mean expressing love for humanity? If so, why should one express love for something which seems to hate itself? These are just a few of the questions which arise from viewing this film (and some of which Rublev seems to ask himself, illustrated by at first a naive belief in the good in all humanity, then disillusion, and eventually a rekindling of faith), but it makes the montage of Rublev's work at the end of the film all the more effective, since it creates an understanding of the pain and anguish that lie behind these images.To regard Andrei Rublev as one movie (assuming that the general definition of a movie is simply a big chunk of storyline) would do some injustice to the brilliantly unorthodox nature of its narrative, in that it's a collection of eight mini-story lines, all of which can be viewed as individual pieces, and three of which could easily pass as masterpieces in their own right. My personal favourite is the third one; Rublev's dialogue with Theophanes The Greek over the self-destructive nature of humanity is, to me at least, one of the most moving moments on film (this is possibly due to Theophanes voicing an opinion I personally arrived at some time before initially watching this film - and one I unfortunately happen to agree with).Like most of Tarkovsky's movies, Andrei Rublev demands repeated viewings so the film can be absorbed and understood in full. But by doing so you'll begin to realise that this is possibly the most rewarding of all cinematic works, and consequently the most wonderful. The best film ever made? I certainly think so."
"This film is impossible to understand at once. You need to watch it at least twice to be able to understand something. At first it seems to be an abstract art-house film about a painter in the 15th century, a film which talks about one artist's plight towards his own ideals in difficult times, a philosophical/historical movie. And it may be the part of the great Tarkovsky's intention.Yet as you watch it twice you realize that it is also about religion. And about the ideal of man. The first scene clearly shows how man has always strived to reach towards something higher and how he often failed. This film is also about human nature, as always in Tarkovsky's films. We follow Andrei through his dark and troubled times and adventures and of special importance is the Tatar attack part. Here we see Tarkovsky depict the everlasting hunger for power and the effect it can have on a man. The Russian prince betrays his own country and must stand trial to his own conscience after watching the town of Vladimir get destroyed by the horde of wild Tatars. The scene in the church is also of greater significance, as is the river scene with the pagan festival. They all show the conflict of religions and also moral values.All said, the movie wouldn't be as great without the last part, the one with the boy and the church bell. It illustrates the rebirth of Russia, Christian Russia and the final scene with the hoisting of the bell is one of the best scenes ever in film history. It shows us that faith is a feeble thing;if the bell didn't work, everything would have ended differently. But thanks to a boy's dedication and hard work, the bell tolled and the faith returned to the feeble heads and hearts of people.The miraculous sudden appearance of color in the very end and the wonderful,solemn music really highlight the ultimate message of this film. Which is-art is sacred and immortal and transcends time.At the time of its release, I believe only Tarkovsky himself and perhaps Andrey Kontchalovsky, the co-writer, knew just how great a masterpiece this film really is. It has taken the world some time to discover it, but it was worth it. With perfect acting, specially by Anatoli Solonytsin, perfect music, perfect screenplay and perfect direction, what else can I give it but a perfect 10?"
"One of the finest films ever made. Films like this are what give the medium its purpose. It is rich, beautifully shot and acted, and extraordinarily powerful. Like all great works of art, it requires many viewings and much thought to discover the various layers of intellectual and aesthetic meaning within it. That is why a simple description of the plot would give the prospective viewer little idea of what the movie is actually about. True, it is the tale of Russia's greatest icon painter. But it is also a rumination on art, the artist, relgion, love, culture, conformity, cruelty, and much more. See it and discuss it with some bright friends."
"This movie is set in mediaeval Russia, the world of unspeakable cruelty, poverty and injustice. And yet, this is a profoundly humanistic, profoundly spiritual, profoundly individualistic and profoundly uncompromising film. The photography is absolutely beautiful, mesmerising, original and superb. But it is the anguished soul and conscience of this film and of its main hero that truly make this a great picture.There are no cliches here, no stereotypes and no sucking up to the audience. A brutally honest and yet very moving, touching and optimistic film. And it is not about the nature of a genius. Rather, it is about a man's ability and duty to preserve and be true to his humanity, his freedom, his soul, his heart and his gift, no matter what century it is or what the circumstances are. Watch it to remind yourself of what it really means to be human."
"Considering the great quantity of films in existence, there are very few that even come close to being considered the greatest of all time. Having seen my share of 'masterpieces' I have come to regard Andrei Rublev as the greatest of them all, although I admit that this is debatable. Nonetheless, this film seems to be stigmatized as being too long or boring - maybe because it's by Tarkovksy, or that it's black and white, or that it's Russian - I really don't know where this comes from. If you can get past any preconceived notions of what the movie is going to be like,and just sit down for a few seconds and watch it, you will probably be able to see from the beginning that this is an extremely important, unmissable film - not to mention captivating and exciting, although very dark and disturbing throughout. The amount of skill and thought, and work that went into this film echoes within the timeless imagery that the director has created. Any serious fan of the cinema would be doing themselves a serious disservice by avoiding this movie any longer. If you interested in the works of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky, you'll be able to take something of another level from this film, as there are many subtle references and parallels to their writings and teachings throughout this movie. It could be argued that the film itself is a cinematic representation of the law of three. Regardless, this is a truly extraordinary thing to behold."
"I follow several threads of fine films. Most of these concern intelligent notions of structure, of architecture. Welles, Greenaway, Eisenstein, Kurosawa. These mend sense and intellect enhancing both.But there is another thread, one that eschews selfaware structure -- where idea is anathema. Nature is celebrated. Rich intuition and meditative spontaneity are sufficiently nutritious in some hands, but these are amazingly few. The so-called 'new wave' tried it, at least initially. Lots of other appearances as well, mostly failures, some lovely. Among the attempts, I know of only two filmmakers who have mastered this tricky approach of avoiding knowledge: Tarkovsky and Malick. Of these, Malick is more abstractly sensual.After all, Tarkovsky must deal with that dark cloth of Russian self-pity, that tradition of grand themes and epic fate, something which does not burden Malick. So the metaphoric content is heavy. That's fine, an acceptable skeleton for a nearly three hour meditation. All is self-referential: a set of images about an imagemaker: the actor's wife played the retarded girl who factors so importantly. During the production he was cheating on her with who was to become his second wife. The girl goes off with a Tartar, leaving Rublev. Many other scenes refer to Rublev's situation, resolved by Tarkovsky's action. For instance, we have a sequence where Rublev hesitates to paint a scene of fateful pain. This is followed by Tarkovsky doing just that. The extension of metaphor among parts of the film (ballooner and bellringer to Rublev's story) extends from the film to the filmmaker and thence from him to us.What I found even more interesting was his confidence in complex compositions and long, long multiperspective tracking shots. Compared to other swoopers, this camera seems curious, impetuous, not at all as if the shots were planned. Hard to believe it is only his second feature. This alone expands one's imagination with only a couple viewings, but combined with the notion of folded metaphor (including visual metaphor) it becomes a truly great and singular work.(Some classical symmetries touch multiple places: a jester within the play; solitude in the context of relationship; creating in the unknown; broken symmetry through one twin killing another. Some new ones: pagan fire and water underlying ritual exuberance, either sex or religious art.)Alas, the DVD has a discouragingly vapid commentary. But then I guess that's the whole point, and with the loss of potatohead Soviets, we need to substitute the next best thing."
"This is the most visually moving film I've seen. Until Rublev, I didn't truly understand how stunning and engaging a film could be.  The vignettes of Russian life are very thought-provoking, the cinematography the best I've seen, and the result is a film that moves me every time I watch it. Approach it with an open mind, and be prepared for a slowly unfolding story. Do this, and you'll be deeply rewarded and satisfied in a way that few films will ever match."
"Having had the privilege of visiting Russia and anticipating a return next month, I admit to being a complete Russophile.  The mystery, emotion and history of this remarkable country have found places in my soul I was scarcely aware of.  This masterful film manages to evoke the sensations I felt during my month's long visit.  The Russian people, among the dearest I have known, have suffered as have few others in all of history.  The art of this magnificent country is always tinged in dark tones.  The music, if not in a minor key, evokes minor key emotions.  The literature, even with Gogol, clearly delineates the suffering and hardships with which all Russians are familiar.  Therefore, it was not surprising to find all of this so strongly depicted in Andrei Rublyov.  However, the beauty that somehow transcended the misery and bleakness constantly before the viewer was redemptive.  The scene in which the iconographer holds the sobbing boy is one of the most touching and devastating on film.  I sat before the screen with tears streaming down my cheeks.  It may sound hyperbolic, but I found this film absolutely life-changing.  I am returning to Russia to volunteer in an orphanage.  Moreover, I am fully prepared to end my life in that great enigmatic country.  Indeed, this film has changed my life.  I cannot recommend it too highly."
"Who is more truly arrogant - a film-maker who makes a three-hour film, or someone who takes it upon himself to criticise the film after only watching two hours on the grounds that ""my time is too valuable""? Tarkovsky spent 1961-65 planning and making the film and 1966-71 waiting for it to get some kind of release. Is three hours of your time really that much more valuable than ten years of his? One thing I will say, though, is that the subtitles on the London print were appalling - whoever thought that contemporary American slang was an acceptable way of translating medieval Russian should have suffered the same treatment meted out to the stonemasons. But I certainly can't blame Tarkovsky for that!"
"Just as Andrei Rublev faced doubt about whether or not, having sinned, he could continue his celebrated iconography, I likewise find myself in two minds about Andrei Tarkovsky's film. My experience with the director's other work is, as usual, limited, but I still couldn't shake that persistent expectation that I would love 'Andrei Rublev (1969).' There is certainly much to love about it, but my appreciation for the film can best be described as admiration rather than affection, and, though I can speak with only the utmost praise for Tarkovsky's achievement, it doesn't occupy that exclusive space close to my heart. The film is a deeply-personal religious work, an examination of faith and moral values, and so perhaps it's inevitable that the film didn't leave such a deep impression, considering my preference towards atheism; one unfortunately cannot discard all personal convictions for the mere purposes of appreciating a work of art. I do, however, like to think that the majesty of cinema, in most cases, is able to transcend religious boundaries.Andrei Tarkovsky released his first feature-length film, 'Ivan's Childhood,' in 1962. Even prior to its release, the director had already expressed interest in filming the life of great Russian iconographer Andrei Rublev, even though very little is actually known about his life. Working with a screenplay written by himself and Andrei Konchalovsky, Tarkvosky began filming in 1964, and a 205-minute cut was screened for a private audience in Moscow in 1966. The critical response, however, was mixed, and sizeable cuts were made to the film's running time, before a 186-minute version screened out of competition at the Cannes Film Festival in 1969. I'm not entirely sure which version I ended up watching; the time counter indicated somewhere around 165 minutes, though my brief research couldn't uncover any major missing sequences. In hindsight, I should probably have held out for longer and acquired the Criterion Collection DVD, which restores the picture to its four-hour glory. In several years' time, when I inevitably decide to revisit Tarkovsky's film, I'll make certain to do just that.'Andrei Rublev' is divided into nine distinct segments, including a colour epilogue displaying Rublev's weathered icons as they exist today. They each explore a facet of the great painter's life, placing particular emphasis on his faith in God and how it relates to his work on frescos and icons. Interestingly, though Rublev (Anatoli Solonitsyn) himself appears in most of the stories, he is often hidden in the background, a passive observer on the behaviour of others, including Kirill (Ivan Lapikov), who is jealous of Rublev's recognition, and young Boriska (Nikolai Burlyayev), who successfully casts a bell using faith rather than knowledge. One consequence of this narrative format is a lack of cohesiveness in Tarkovsky's storytelling. We adequately follow the plot of each segment, but, as the whole, the film doesn't seem to build towards any notable climactic revelation  the completed film is equal to the sum of its parts, which is still very impressive, but pulls it short of being a masterpiece. Once again, however, I must acknowledge that the 205-minute version may potentially correct this problem.One statement that can not be disputed, however, is that 'Andrei Rublev' really is a beautiful piece of film-making. Vadim Yusov's black-and-white photography captures the exquisite delicateness of nature with almost heartbreaking intricacy; even the raindrops of a midday shower are imbued with the gentle elegance of the Heaven from which they ostensibly fell. Tarkovsky finds simple beauty in the quiver of a tree branch in the breeze, the leisurely flow of a river, herds of livestock fleeing from an aerial balloon. In portraying the complete opposite, the destruction of nature, the director is capable but not quite the master he is otherwise. The raiding of Vladimir by a troop of Tatars was obviously supposed to be the centrepiece of the picture, but Tarkovsky underplays every detail to such an extent that his ""chaos"" ultimately winds down into a staged conflict. Compare this sequence with Sergei Bondarchuk's burning of Moscow in 'War and Peace (1967),' in which one feels as though he has descended into the fires of Hell, and the contrast is telling."
"The camera work in this movie is wonderful from start to end. Unfortunately, the beauty of the camera work sometimes gets in the way of the story-telling. In almost every scene, the camera lingers beautifully on scenes, so that I both appreciate the visual art and wish the movie would hurry up and tell the story. All of the acting is very good, but it's rarely demanding because the camera owns the scenes, not the actors.The story is episodic, with little connection between most of the segments except the recurrence of the title character, a 15th century icon-painter. The first episode, about people flying a hot-air balloon, seems to have no connection to the rest. In another episode, Andrei wanders into the frolicking nudity of a pagan summer festival, where his monastery robes make him obviously out of place.A few of the episodes shared another connection besides having Andrei present. The connection is a pair of twin brothers, both princes, who hate each other. In one of those, a prince guides a band of Tatar horsemen to Vladimir, a town ruled by his brother. He invites the Tatars to loot it, so that in the process they will kill or terrorize many of the other prince's subjects and ruin one of his towns.One episode can't properly be described without a spoiler warning. Skip the rest of this paragraph unless you like spoilers. It shows a band of workers who, after building a palace for one of the twin princes, set off to work on their next construction job. But their next employer is the prince's brother, who intends to employ them to build an even grander palace. The prince sends horsemen after them, where they blind the unfortunate workers. OK, no more spoilers.The best episodes are near the end. The main character in one of them is a woman Andrei had rescued during the attack on Vladimir. The woman was mute and somewhat disturbed, possibly as a result of the attack. Similarly, Andrei was deeply troubled by what he had done to rescue her. When Tatars appeared again, she ran to their leader. Andrei tried to rescue her again, but she resisted. Fortunately, she turned out not to need a rescue that time.The final episode was the best of all, and features the most challenging and impressive acting performance. The teenage son of a bell-maker leads the casting of a huge church bell, because all the other bell-makers had died of the plague, and he is the only one who can be found who knows the secret of bell-making. It's a big job, requiring construction of a casting pit, a mold, melting furnaces, and a structure to lift the finished bell from the pit. He is very nervous, because he's doing an expensive, difficult, uncertain job without his father's guidance, for an employer who might kill him if he fails.I saw the director's original 205 minute version, on the Criterion DVD. Soviet censors cut the movie, troubled by the allegorical reference to treatment of artists, including movie-makers. Later distributors cut the movie further, to make it accessible to a broader audience. While I would object to cuts for censorship, I think the movie would tell its story better if it were heavily cut for length. Any editing to improve the story-telling would unfortunately come at the cost of some wonderful cinematography, since every scene in the movie was a visual wonder. For all its beauty, I don't think there was even two hours of story-telling in this movie."
"After being tortured with poor Russian film-making for my first three outings  One Day In the Life of Ivan Denisovich (1970), Night Watch (2004), and Russian Ark (2002)  I was lucky enough to experience the greatness of Andrei Tarkovsky with four consecutive quality films  Solaris (1972), Stalker (1979), The Mirror (1975), and Ivan's Childhood (1962)  the last of which is no less than spectacular. Riding on cloud 9, I popped Andrei Rublev into my DVD player with quiet anticipation as this film is considered by many to be Tarkovsky's greatest film (and one of the best films ever made).Sufficed to say that my excitement subsided slightly after a ridiculous opening air balloon sequence, and dissipated completely within the first hour of mind-numbing boredom. Tarkovsky's trademark atmospherics are nowhere to be found, the dialogue consists of tireless sermonizing, and the scoring is hopelessly over-dramatic. I can't believe that this film was made by the same director of the aforementioned quality films. This outing feels like one of those over-hyped Hollywood ""classics"" that are moreso exercises in amateurish movie-making that are lucky enough to earn recognition from nostalgic sympathy alone. Overpraised, poorly made tripe like this is why many people refuse to watch older movies.Now, I've read a boatload of positive reviews that point out the various symbols and hidden meanings within this film, so I revisited certain portions with added vigor. To my disappointment, however, the film continued to hold no more interest than an instruction manual. Give me a 150-minute Yasujiro Ozu film any day of the week and I'll eat through it in one sitting. But ""Andrei Rublev"" is dry, coma-inducing cinema at its worst. I'm sure film students and their kin will love dissecting the various camera angles, but the entertainment value of this film is near zilch. Unlike some of the PETA nutcases here who rate this film a 1/10 due to horse-killings, I dislike ""Andrei Rublev"" because it's quite simply an incredibly dull film. The running time is about an hour too long. Disregarding the fact that self-congratulatory, pretentious directors like Peter Jackson and Akira Kurosawa would find much to like in an additional 60 minutes of nothingness tacked onto an already stretched out movie, I need to apply my objectivity and point out that ""Andrei Rublev"" is sheer torture to sit through from beginning to end. Nostalghia (1983) is nearly as torturous, by the way.Overly long, blandly shot, frequently silly, and hopelessly dull, this exercise in over-dramatic fluff proves once and for all that most people have no taste in film whatsoever. There's no valid reason for this pile of horse manure to be considered a better film than the excellent ""Ivan's Childhood."" I know that fans of ""art-house"" movies frequently lack the inner strength to criticize a film such as this, but some objectivity would be appreciated for those of us who care more for entertaining cinema than directorial pandering. Every director has some duds in their portfolio. Live with it.One thing that surprises me is how a frankly religious film such as this is uniformly praised by IMDb users. Most of the users I know are raving liberal atheists with a giant stick up their rear-end, so it's interesting to see them pine over this movie like no-brain lemmings. I guess artsy pretentiousness automatically overrides their fanatical hatred for religion, because the superficial preachy ramblings are laid on thick and fast in ""Andrei Rublev."" How do all of these naturalists reconcile their subconscious thoughts  which are probably uttering the word ""bullsh*t"" after every line of dialogue in this movie  with their snobby lust for art-house trash? I would pay for the research funds if a psychologist wished to perform this study. Incredibly interesting stuff."
"You cannot see this movie without being prepared. You want to see it preferably alone with no disturbances. And you need patience and the right mood - contemplative, philosophical.This movie is an experience. I have seen nothing like it and doubt I ever will. I am a cynic by nature yet this movie completely affected me, even though I cannot put a finger on why. I broke down and wept at the end of the bell making scene. It was a spiritual experience.Andrei Rublev was my first Tarkovsky which helped (he does get repetitive across movies), but it's still easily his best work. In my opinion, that's because this movie proves that art and hard work are not mutually exclusive, but in fact good art *requires* hard work. Just notice how much vision and effort has gone into the last bell making scene. Also the raid scene, the orgy scene, the violence, all these are impossible to be art without the effort.I feel like I'm overselling but this movie is a masterpiece. Watch it."
"The more I explore Tarkovsky the more I get confused. No, don't take me wrong, I get confused in which movie of his should be my favorite. Ivan, Solaris, Stalker all were 9/10 that is I simply loved all those, but after watching this I have to rate this as 11/10 and my favorite AK's creation but it doesn't seem very real as all his other movies (so far I have seen) are all simply beautiful. AK's movies are the link between me and Russia, as I am not Russian and don't even know their language, culture or even country very well. So after watching his work it seems to me as if I am getting closer to the country and everything about it. It's an amazing experience for me as a viewer and a person.Now talking about Rublev, this movie is rather than a story of Rublev is a story of his times, times he lived in. Turbulent times that Russia in general went through as he lived in it as a painter. I think this is a major point why this movie is so good and works so well. The photography is amazing each frame of the movie is actually as if a work of painter, background score is too good blends very well with the scenes, acting too is good especially the main central role. He makes you feel his problems, worries, soul search all as real. Coming to direction it is undoubtedly one of the best works of Tarkovsky and I wonder why this movie is not listed in any of the top 100 movies of all time as a matter of fact any other Tarkovsky's movies. Each frame of the movie is picture perfect right from the opening scene when a man is trying to fly in the hot balloon to the end when the bell is tolled perfectly to the great art work of Tarkovsky in real. The movie has all the Tarkovsky's signature element in them, beautiful use of earth elements air, water and fire to the great effect as well his soul searching, God related questions, answers, explanation and all. Also most important point for many movie goers who criticize him for his slow paced movies, this one is very different from his other movies, even though it's long but not for a single second you will feel bored as it is not slow paced and keeps you engaged in the story. Rating: 11/10. I cannot wait to explore his other movies."
"I recently watched the 205 minute cut of Andrei Rublev, on a DVD from the Criterion Collection. At first, I was extremely confused. But soon enough I was able to accept the fact that this would not be a ""conventional"" movie, so to speak, and sat back and relaxed, ready for one of the greatest cinematic experiences of my life.That being said, once I was finished, I thought, ""Meh."" The film seemed to me to be overly long and a bit boring in parts. I still liked it, but thought that it was overrated.But then I couldn't get it out of my head. I kept thinking about the symbolism, the beautiful black and white cinematography, the somber performances, the haunting soundtrack, and the brilliant direction.I realized that to view this film, one must be prepared to watch three and a half emotionally taxing hours of pure, unadulterated genius. And so, within a few hours, my opinion of this movie changed to mediocre to one of the greatest movies of all time.God, looking back on what I've written, I realize that I must sound like a pretentious hipster d-bag. I assure you this is not the case, and my reviews, on IMDb or otherwise, don't usually come across like this. I can only say, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and one that requires repeat viewings."
"Some guy takes off in a hot air balloon as a bunch of people are coming up to him in boats. Are they after him? He floats for a while, then he floats over some boats (are they the same boats?), and then crashes. End of scene. Does he die? Who is he? Then 3 guys are leaving somewhere; they are painters (you find out later they are also monks). They stop at a stable full of unfunny jesters to escape from a storm. Some guys come and take one of the jesters away and bash his head into a tree. Then they smash his balalaika. Why? Who are they? Then a church painter asks one of the monks to be his assistant. The monk says only if he comes to the monastery and asks him in front of Andrej Rublev (a famous painter). Why? The church painter sends someone else to the monastery to ask Andrej Rublev to be his assistant instead. Why? This pisses the monk off and he disses everyone in the monastery, then takes off. His dog follows him, so he beats it to death with a stick. Why? Then a monk and his assistant are wondering in the woods and they come across some old guy who has ants crawling up his legs. He slaps the assistant. Why? Then some people are in the woods and some guys ride up on horses and gouge their eyes out. Who are these people? Then Andrej is very upset and smears something on a wall. It is after the people have had their eyes gouged out, so is it blood? (This is a b & w movie.) It looks chunky on his fingers. Paint? (He is supposed to be painting the wall.) The some woman comes along and touches the stuff on the wall and smells it a few times, then starts crying, then smears it around with her hands. Who is she? More disjointed, slow-moving, confusing scenes such as these and no character development. I didn't watch the second tape (yes, there's 2 tapes of this stuff). I had to force myself to watch the first tape all the way through. It didn't even have beautiful cinematography. On the box it says dazzling, a masterpiece, beautiful, harrowing, mesmerizing, soaring, majestic, an adventure, hypnotic beauty, a wild epic... What? Sight and Sound calls it ""one of the top 15 films of all time"" I will never take their advice on anything."
"Andrei Rublyov (1969) by Andrei Tarkovsky is my number 1 (shares with Tarkovsky's Zerkalo) film of all time. It is a pinnacle of film-making for me - one of few most visually beautiful films as well as one of the deepest films ever. The beauty of every frame is exquisite - I have to pause film very often just to admire it.There are only couple of more films that have touched me as profoundly as Andrei Rublyov did. I am always surprised to hear that it is very slow film - for Tarkovsky, it is very well paced, and I am never tired of its 3+ hours running time. Film based on life of the 15-th century monk and icon painter Andrei Rublyov who wanders through the country torn by barbarism, and later by Tatar invaders. Tarkovsky explores several very important topics in his film: what is talent and how an Artist is responsible for it? The Man and God, the Artist and the Power. The final 20 minutes of the film are the best and most inspiring I've seen in the cinema. For me, the last chapter of the film, ""The Bell"" is perhaps the greatest in its emotional impact piece of cinema ever made. I can't stay calm and collected when I see it. Boriska sobbing like a child after his Bell rings - and he is a child, a boy, lonely and lost; Andrei breaking his vows of silence, his words to Boriska of hope, of many roads they would walk together. Andrei's icons that we are finally allowed to behold and admire, their breathtaking divine beauty and serenity, their melodic lines and pure joyful colors, the faces of the saints and angels with their eternal mystery, quiet knowledge and sadness, looking inside themselves and inside our very souls; the music that literally takes you somewhere above this Earth, to the heights of such purity and beauty that you could hardly breath and where even the ""swiftest birds"" of pain and death can't reach you..."
"From director Andrey Tarkovskiy (Solaris, Mirror), this Russian film was another of the titles featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, I hoped it would be another good choice to be included. Basically this story, divided into eight episodes, charts the life of the famous iconic painter, artist Andrei Rublev (Anatoli Solonitsyn), who lives in 15th Century Russia. The film is essentially a study and insight into the meaningfulness and importance of art, religion and faith, and how these ideas are challenged with the events played out. The historical events that occur include an attempt at the first hot air balloon, the decoration of Cathedral of the Annunciation in Moscow, and of course the Tsardom of Russia, which included the invasion by the Tatar people. Starring Ivan Lapikov as Kirill, Nikolai Grinko as Danil Chorny, Nikolai Sergeyev as Theophanes the Greek, Irma Raush as Idiot Girl (Durochka), Nikolay Burlyaev as Boriska, Yuriy Nazarov as The Grand Prince / His Brother, The Lesser Prince and Rolan Bykov as The Jester. In the leading role Solonitsyn is a good noble character with a keen eye for his works, being set in a medieval period the most memorable scenes for me were the battle sequences, a crucifixion, the unearthing, raising and ringing of a large bell, and a short breakaway from black and white to colour to see the real works of Rublev, I will confess I found it hard to understand what was going on, but for the imagery, such as costume and sets, this is a worthwhile biographical drama. Very good!"
"To review Tarkovsky's crowning achievement one must realize that this is a film that goes above and beyond what anything from any other filmmaker is capable of. Andrei Rublev is a film that goes beyond the capacity of conventional cinema (art film or otherwise)and becomes the essence of film as art. Andrei Rublev ceases to proclaim a message as many other films, but rather offers what every filmmaker strives for: a look at why art exists, and its role in life for all beings. Andrei Rublev is a film that won't speak to everybody, it won't even speak to all artists, but to those it speaks to will become moved in ways unimaginable. The film captures not only the essence of the artist's purpose, but also our purposes as individuals.The film begins with a short scene wherein a man tries to fly, but comes crashing down witnessed only by a horse. This short scene alone offers so much, the man representing the fall of all men or our need to become above other creatures, the horse representing life or loneliness and the barren countryside representing a world that is unfriendly to all men. This scene alone is up for multiple interpretations, many of which would be equally right. The film never tells you how to look at it, but allows you to bring your own philosophy and meaning to it. Ultimately its basic themes are vivid, but its many meanings remain as ambiguous as ever, countless viewings will bring more and more to the film, and in truth it is probably impossible to fully fathom the meaning of it. As with all great art it must be experienced and made to relate to one personally to find its meaning, it cannot just be viewed and admired.The vivid themes of the film come from the ideas of art, man's need for art and the artist's role in history. Andrei Rublev is a film that deals with both the futility of being a Christian artist in a Godless world, and with the impact art can have to bring God to a more personal level. These themes are developed in seven stages, each one differing immensely from the other, with the core ideas and the artist Rublev being shared in every one. Though these themes seem to center around and deal exclusively with art, they are very implicit to every human being's lifestyle. Art can be used as an allegory for our gifts, the idea that we should not hide what we can offer the world, just as the artist should not hide his art from the world. Our gifts and talents can be used to glorify God and bring hope, even if the world does not have a lot of hope, despite the often felt futility of doing what we are gifted in, we bring goodness into the world through them.Ultimately the film offers this at its core, however there are many more ideas and meanings the individual must bring out of the film to impart its full impact. Through patience and connections the viewer can make the film into a personal experience and in doing this may become moved deeper than ever before. After all isn't this every artists wish?"
"My Rating : 9/10Why is this such a great film? Well, for one, it is Andrei Tarkovsky and he is the ultimate master of the visual medium.Films like this are what give the medium its purpose. It is rich, beautifully shot and acted, and extraordinarily powerful. Like all great works of art, it requires many viewings and much thought to discover the various layers of intellectual and aesthetic meaning within it. That is why a simple description of the plot would give the prospective viewer little idea of what the movie is actually about.In Andrei Tarkovsky's hugely ambitious 1966 epic of medieval Russia, a young man whose village and family have been destroyed by the plague convinces the Grand Prince to let him make a beautiful new bell. The boy, named Boriska (and played by Nikolai Burlyaev with a whipsawing combination of youthful exuberance and self-flagellating despair), comes from a family of bell makers. Boriska claims that before his father died, he revealed to him the secret of casting a bronze bell. The boy, fresh-faced and inexperienced as he is, is hired. He enlists a small army of workers and runs them ragged as the seasons pass. Bouncing around like a busy bumblebee, he berates them about the right kind of clay, the right kind of pit, the right amount of silver, and at one point even has his best friend flogged for insubordination. Only briefly, and secretly, does he betray any hesitation, any sense that he might fail. Giant holes are dug; coarse chunks of dirt pass among dry, scabbed hands; massive fires are built; mad, exasperated eyes stare out at us in indignation, fear, doubt, petulance. Are these people forging a bell or a new world?Finally, the bell is built, and hung, and rung. We wait an unbearably long time for its clapper to finally strike and send off a loud, low, clear, and perfect chime; Tarkovsky was known for making long, deliberately paced movies, but he was also a master of suspense. Having succeeded at long last, Boriska collapses in tears and frustration. Now, the film's protagonist, the legendary Russian monk and icon painter Andrei Rublev (Anatoly Solonitsyn, in one of the great passive performances of cinema history), comes to the young man and comforts him. Amid his tears, Boriska reveals that his father never imparted to him the secret of bell making. The boy has been, essentially, flying blind.Rublev is a mesmerizing portrait of an artist and cleric undone by a world that is cruel, chaotic, unexplainable. And it's obviously about a lot more than medieval Russia; Tarkovsky never shot an impersonal frame, and he spent his entire career struggling for the integrity of his work. Suppressed by Soviet authorities, Rublev wasn't seen in the USSR until 1971. Tarkovsky's diaries from the period, among the most candid and anguished writings you'll ever read by a filmmaker, are filled with exasperated accounts of officials placing obstacles in the path of his picture's release, even as it garners praise and awards internationally. When the movie finally opened at home, the director saw no ads or posters for it anywhere, even though it was selling out its screenings. Many of his later films would suffer even worse fates.Rublev's crisis of faith comes as a result of confronting a world that doesn't seem in any way to reflect the divinity to which he's dedicated his life. He's a monk wandering a godless world, unsure if there is anything beyond the misery and horror he sees all around him. Boriska has the bell he doesn't know how to make, and Rublev has the icons he's forgotten how to paint. To that duo we may also add Tarkovsky, with the films he's not allowed to direct, or release. All three men must find a way to persevere, to not only act as if there is a different, better world, but in some way to help bring it about through - and, perhaps more importantly, within - their work. What if, Tarkovsky seems to ask, the silence of God is the very essence of God? What if the fact that there is no secret is the secret?"
"The film's final version, shown on Canne film festival and shown in many countries afterwards, is titled ""Andrei Rublev"". So-called ""original version"" today was titled ""Passion according to Andrei""(Страсти по Андрею). I think that they are different films, and all shortcomings that many reviewers of ""Andrei Rublev"" pointed out are far more obvious in that ""original version"" (which was released on DVD,unfortunately, by ""Criterion"", famous level among cinema lovers).Tarkovsky himself, after his emigration to West, never complained as if Soviet authorities had spoiled his film by forcing him to re-edit it.Of course he knew that the long period of re-editing, which was really annoying for him at first, allowed him to clear up surplus shots and episodes(including those of lengthy animal abusing, of wrestling of Great Prince with his younger brother on snow) and to correct inadequate editing(especially that of ""Bell"").So I recommend everyone to watch ""re-edited""version, which is really ""Andrei Rublev"", and not to see lengthy 3 hours and 26 minutes ""original version"" which is half-made product. But if you are interested in the practical technique of editing film, maybe comparing these two films is useful. My rating is for ""Andrei Rublev"", which was a favorite film of I. Bergman and is probably still so for many other filmmakers."
"Don't bother with this film if you haven't got patience. Don't bother with it if you aren't interested in being challenged by a serious art film. There is nothing fast or light here. Those who are seeking out films that are spiritual, reflective and artistic, you've found one of the absolute best.One could recommend it simply as a master-class in visual composition. Tarkovsky shares some of the mature Fellini's sensibilities for many different elements of dimension and movement in a medium or long shot. There are often people in the fore, and background. He includes fog, smoke, or drifting snow to add further dimension to the shot. It is very painterly. It is an interesting approach to a biopic of a painter that barely ever shows him paint. Instead, the encounters he has, the things he sees, and his reactions to these things are what inform us. His work is showcased at the end of the narrative, as a coda to the story. How true to history Rublev's story is, in my opinion isn't important. Tarkovsky has created a protagonist, and events that not only explore the mind of the man well, but also give an overview of what Russia was going through at that time. I recently watched this film for the second time. While the first viewing left me thinking that the ending segment is the strong pay-off for the patience it takes to watch the unabridged version (the Criterion Collection DVD was my my medium of viewing this film),on second viewing, I thoroughly enjoyed it from beginning to end. I would also recommend the partial commentary on the CC DVD in helping inform the viewer about Tarkovsky's approach to making this film. Rating: first viewing- 8 of 10 second viewing- 10 of 10"
"I was a little disappointed, having read the euphoric user-comments, and then seeing the movie. Well, the camerawork is very good and some pictures are really impressing - but there's no real story or characters you care for, apparently pure allegory. A lot of bearded men, some telling boring religious monologues, an icon-painter who almost never paints anything, a young un-bearded bell-builder, a lot of more or less cruel medieval things happen, but there's no real connection. And the film is indeed very long........"
"Arguably the best film in Russian cinema crafted by the one of greatest filmmakers of all time, and considered by some to one of the best films ever made.Andrei Tarkovsky had already put himself on the map as an internationally-recognized director by the time this film was made, having won the Golden Lion award in Venice for his first full-length feature film IVAN'S CHILDHOOD.ANDREI RUBLYOV was his second feature and remains his most ambitious and monumental undertaking. The script, by Tarkovsky and Andrei Konchalovsky, follows historical record scrupulously and where no record was available, makes educated speculation in its story about the title 15th-century icon painter's tribulations.The story's universal concerns of finding meaning, direction and conviction in one's life transcend the cultural and historical trappings. The film is uncompromising in its level of historical detail, entirely unsentimental and is devoid of Soviet propaganda, and so inevitably when it came out, Soviet censors suppressed it, demanding cuts. The film was not seen by the world at large until seven years after its completion, four years after winning the International Critics' Prize at the Cannes Film Festival.There are several versions of the film running up to 205 minutes. The 185-minute cut was Tarkovsky's preferred version."
"This movie belongs to the group of artistic achievements that cannot be described by simple words, if by words at all. It is beyond words. True, pure art. One must see it and absorb it. There are no good and/or bad scenes. It is a complete and closed entity. One must see it many times, at various ages. It is like seeing again and again, every morning the same new life long love that makes life meaningful. One discovers every day new light and new images, inside and around. One cannot absorb it in one view, one should not attempt to absorb it in one view, one must not absorb it in one view. This movie is a life long artistic companion. It is precisely because of this richness of experiences that it provides, that I did not tell a single word about the movie. Look at me, at what it did to me, and hope for the like for you."
"Andrei Rublev (1969)**** After the successful debut with Ivan's Childhood (1962) very talented Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky decided to shot a picture about the XV Century famous icon painter.This is not a typical biography film since there are little facts about Rublev. Instead, Tarkovsky used this historic figure to tell some universal truths about mankind in general and Russians in particular.However, he made a masterpiece. This is very demanding movie that requires multiple viewings to fully grasp its amazing content enriched by extraordinary shots. It's like reading a heavy Dostoyevsky novel  sometimes you must repeat some parts. But, if you are open-minded and concentrated the whole way through you'll be richly rewarded with some brilliantly clever, revealing and meaningful content about human vanity, responsibility and spirituality. Tarkovsky's skill is tremendous, pace is deliberate (in good sense), photography and sounds are breathtaking and acting is superb. You won't find entertainment in this one unless entertainment is profound meditation on human nature. So, if your favorite movie is something like Harry Potter... don't bother with this one."
"This is a very unusual film, you have to come prepared to a slowly unwinding film full of powerful imagery. It pays to be wide awake. Even if you don't like the first 3/4th of the film (and it is quite violent at times), please hang on for the final part, the one about the bell.This last bit is a monument to both human Hubris and to what people can do when they believe in something. It is a divinely inspired piece of cinema, and I'm crying as I'm typing this. You must absolutely see it, if you can, and on the big screen."
"ANDREI RUBLEV is another slow and ponderous movie from Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky, a man best known in the west for his lengthy sci-fi effort SOLARIS. This one's even less accessible to the average cinema goer, featuring a dense plot loaded with religious content. The story is about a real life Russian painter of the 15th century, told in various illustrative chapters.I admit that I found the subject matter of this film rather off-putting and the lengthy running time even more so. Tarkovsky's film is picturesque and beautiful, yes, but not on the same level as Bergman, for example. I liked the way the story is broken up into chapters but much of the material seems deliberately pious and the mannered performances don't help. The most dramatic part is a Tartar raid around the midway mark, but sadly this moment features some real-life animal cruelty that makes the experience rather repellent."
"Howard Hawks defined a masterpiece as a film with three great scenes and no bad ones. What would Hawks have said about Andre Rublev, a film with no bad scenes and some fifty scenes that are not just great but perfect in every aspect? This is one of the most difficult films ever made, so don't expect a cake walk going into it. Truth be told, I shut it off after the first tape of two on my first attempt. I tried it again later the same week, and found it to be one of the best film ever made, maybe even the best (although I'd have to see it once more to confirm that). When the screen went black, I was ready to pass out. It was a complete religious experience, one that can bring you closer to God than any church or even Bible ever could."
"What Tarkovsky has created here is nothing short of a masterpiece. I consider this to be a truly landmark film. How, exactly, is it landmark? This is the first film that established cinema as an art form. Sure, there were plenty of great films before. However, they were just that: great films. There were great paintings before painting became a pure art, just as there were great songs before music became an art.What is art? Was there ever a more passionately debated question that the meaning of art? Art is nothing that can be defined by words; words are merely symbols, and symbols each represent an individual concrete idea, which make up sentences that best attempt to explain a concrete idea. Anyone who has read George Orwell's NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR is familiar with this concept. In it, the totalitarian government tries to be, well, a completely totalitarian government. It is so extreme that it even attempts to control the thoughts of humankind by changing the language they speak. This is precisely what language does - it limits ideas. How is this barrier surpassed? Though art, by Jove! Tarkovsky's only major film before this was IVAN'S CHILDHOOD. While an excellent film itself, it was only the precursor to a great filmmaker's oeuvre. The only other Tarkovsky films I've seen are STALKER and THE MIRROR. He has a very distinct, personal style. His films are the closest anybody has gotten to a creating a memory. They are not traditional story lines. This is where the landmark effect comes in. Before Tarkovsky, there were, as I have said, other great films. For example, there was the American CITIZEN KANE. At its time, it was a really revolutionary film, and the closest anything had gotten to being a piece of art. Many scenes from Citizen Kane were nothing short of mesmerizing. However, the film itself was still just a film, albeit excellent. Movies from that time were not yet an independent art form. They were sort of a mixture of other arts for all of the senses. For aural, there was music; painting, sculpture, and photography were feasts to the visual senses; for the mind, literature was created, taking the forms of books and plays. When movies came around, they were a combination of these older delights. Some music scores could stand alone by themselves. The stories told in movies were either adapted from an older play or book, or were written in such a way that they could easily be made into a play or book. The most beautiful films consisted of 24 potential pictures to be placed in a gallery per second. They never really fit together all too well. Sure, in the best films (again, CITIZEN KANE) they seemed at ease with each other, but they were still somewhat detached. Tarkovsky was the genius who changed this. Yes, there are those people who will claim that, ""Oooh, the pretty images were my favorite part,"" or ""I found the choral music to be absolutely delightful."" That's not the point. Each of the elements of this film is like a brushstroke in a mural or a single violin in a grand orchestra. They all become one to form a new art: cinema. This new cinema can feel like many different things. Some people might get a dream or a pleasant memory from it. This is more the case with Tarkovsky's THE MIRROR. What is found most in ANDREI RUBLEV is a variety of emotions. The ultimate experience is that of finding artistic influence. Rublev, the title character, is never actually shown working on one of his paintings. The audience never even gets a good look at one until the very end. It's more about what made him into an artist. A good way of describing this is that it's a piece of art about art. Rublev's art is icon paintings. There is a young boy whose art is church bells. Tarkovsky, the good religious man, shows that God's art was his beautiful creations like the plants in nature and the animals that roam the land (namely horses). All of this is created by the struggles that every human experiences. We cannot express pain if we have never felt it. We cannot express joy if we have never experienced it. Throughout the film, the audience slowly begins to understand just how complex this idea really is. Tarkovsky has created something of an oneiric beauty himself. He does not limit himself; as he had often tried to stress, there are no symbols in a Tarkovsky film, only images. These images express what symbols cannot. This film reminded me in a way of a story told in Michelangelo Antonioni's THE PASSENGER. In it, there is a blind man who finally is cured. At first, he is in love with what he sees, but after a while, all he notices is all the ugly dirt everywhere, and so he decides to end his life. A Tarkovsky film has the opposite effect. It is so beautiful that we begin to see the whole world as it really is. It is easy to forget the grandeur of old trees or the soothing waves that a breeze of wind creates when it passes a field of grass. ANDREI RUBLEV is a refreshing reminder of these; it has one of the most satisfying conclusions in cinema history. The spiritual people have a god (or several) to thank, while everybody else can just relax and enjoy the beauty that has evolved from nature. It's not very often that a movie changes ones outlook on life."
"We know so little about Rublyov and there are very few historical documents, all very brief. What is known is that he lived in 15th-century Russia and that he is considered to be the greatest Russian iconographer. I think I can start already from here by telling that the movie Andrey Rublyov is (among other things) the story about artist and his position in the world, pictured through the regime of the middle-age Russia in this particular case but the story has universal character.You can be very famous (Rublyov surely is!) but yet history might not know anything about you. An artist is often (so to say) a product of his/her time because no one is isolated from the historical events in one way or another. This movie (to quote Tarkovsky) will tell you of the impossibility of creating art outside of the nation's aspirations, of the artist's attempts to express its soul and character, and of the way that an artist's character depends upon his historical situation. As an artist, I was deeply moved by this movie. There is also some hardness that lasts long after the movie ended Although the movie is named by Andrey Rublyov, he appears to be just one of the characters, often passive as he is merely observing the situation but deeply affected by the events.All main characters are different and interesting. All of them have their own tales, personal philosophy and approach to art and events. For example, Theophanes the Greek is already an established iconographer, old enough to live without illusions. For him, art is but a craft. I liked some of his lines very much, like when he said: Yes, I'm going to die. The other day, I saw an angel in my dream. ""Come with me,"" he says. And I answer: ""I'm going to die soon anyway, without your help."" Or when he said (referring to people): Today they praise, tomorrow they'll abuse what they praised only yesterday, and after that they'll forget both you and me. They'll forget everything! The script is written by Andrei Konchalovsky and Tarkovsky. The particular historical background is not bright but has history ever been?! Religion and the regime are in the center of the story but there is much more than that.The entire movie is black and white except the very end, where we can see the actual Rublyov's iconography and that almost gives a sense of the miracle.The movie won three awards. Not enough I would say! Tarkovsky's cinematography is simply beautiful! I think this is a must see movie."
"It's hard to describe and put into words just how great something is without going overboard but this is one of those rare films that deserves all the praise in the world. Why this isn't mentioned by more critics and die-hard film buffs is a mystery because this is easily one of the greatest achievements I've ever seen and it puts to shame some of the other films that have had the monitor ""Great"" slapped on them. Story is about the 15th century Russian monk and painter Andrei Rublyov (Anatoli Solonitsyn) who is summoned by the Grand Prince to work with Theophanes the Greek (Nikolai Sergeyev) in painting the Cathedral of the Annunciation in Moscow.*****SPOILER ALERT***** During Rublyov's journey he witnesses first hand many of the atrocities that are taking place in his country including a pagan orgy (in which he is tempted) and the Tartar raids that has Rublyov himself killing another man. All of this leads to Rublyov making a vow of silence, ""I have nothing more to say to men"" but over the next year he witnesses the casting and raising of a bell by a bell-maker's son (Nikolai Burlyayev) who knows that he will killed by the Grand Prince if it is not successfully completed. Rublyov is so moved by this that it restores his faith (spiritually and artistically) and tells the boy that they should go together, ""You'll cast bells. I'll paint icons"".With this one film director Andrei Tarkovsky has achieved something that most (if not all) other filmmakers could only dream of but he still had to deal with the Russian censors who forced Tarkovsky to edit certain scenes of brutality. The question of what is art and what inspires it has been a debate with Tarkovsky throughout his career but with Andrei Rublyov he seems to use him as a metaphor for where artistic motivation comes from. Without poverty and inhumanity would there be art? Tarkovsky asks these questions but this film is more than just thought provoking because it's also one of the most visually stunning cinematic efforts I have ever seen. Cinematographer Vadim Yusov's haunting black and white imagery makes the bleak Russian countryside look absolutely breathtaking and this is one the finest films ever shot. At 205 minutes this fragmented and episodic film covers events from 1400 to 1423 and while other films are lucky to have at least one memorable scene in it this seems to be one incredible shot after another and the casting of the bell stands as one the most indelible celluloid microcosms ever captured. From the opening scene to the end shots where the viewer can see Rublyov's actual paintings Tarkovsky's epic film is indeed a masterpiece and it's the perfect example of cinema as art."
"What is striking about the film is how everything seems to be meaningful: a bird flying over, ripples in the watter, a face in the crowd. You just know Tarkowski put it there on purpose. Sometimes you can guess what the purpose was, and sometimes not. And it's okay, because often Tarkowski himself couldn't explain the things he did. He wanted the symbols to have different meanings to different people.His black-and-white cinematography is gorgeous. You can tell that each shot was planned like a painting.Warning: people with short attention spans and seekers of immediate gratification (in other words 99% of American public) should not watch this movie."
"Madiana RyskulovaThis movie illustrates how Andrei Rublev gets through challenging times in medieval Russia and, more importantly, overcomes his own psychological dilemma. Still, it is not just an autobiography of an artist, but it is an art itself. It shows the complex relationship between religion and art, their intertwining, and at the same time, the distinctive features that make art to be of a religious kind. In my review, I am going to argue that iconodulism as a religious art aims not only to strengthen and glorify one's faith, but also to test the artist about their own faith that should serve as a main motivation for creating their work of art.There are several reasons that could serve as one's motivation to be a religious artist. For one, as for Kirill, it can be the recognition in a society. The main character Andrei with his fellow monks, Kirill and Daniil, from Andronikov Monastery were wandering in search of some work as icon painters, but only Andrei received an offer from Theophanes the Greek. That was a critical moment to test Kirill's intentions for this position. Although he was first invited by Theophanes, he asked him to do it again in an official form in front of all his fraternity, which he probably did for the sake of fame. It was confirmed by his emotions like anger and envy about Andrei's success, and his spontaneous decision to quit the monastery accompanied by slandering it. ""The monastery has become like a bazaar!"" - he yelled. When he violently killed the dog that wanted to go with him, it could also be an ill omen of a future disaster. For other people, as for Foma, Andrei's apprentice, painting icons is a production of art as a practical job. Every work connected with religious art was only another opportunity to improve his painting in the first place, so he was not really concerned with spiritual aspect of icons. That is why he readily agreed to work in another church of a smaller status. For those people, who are attached to both church and art, as Andrei, religious art has a deeper meaning than simply something people can honor in church. A true religious work of art cannot be done by instructions on the main theme, style, and deadline from above, that is why Andrei did not want to paint the Last Judgement. The situation was only aggravated when he knewabout the violent act ordered by the Grand Prince towards the rest of his party that refused to follow his instructions. Only artist's own ideas and experience (in that case, the appearance of a Yurodivy girl) can help them to develop a better work, that apparently was a feast instead of the Last Judgement.Even though we could see how sincere motivation behind Andrei's religious art was, there were many cases that could utterly destroy someone's faith, but not Andrei's one. In the second episode of the film, when he was talking to Theophanes, we can observe how truly he believed in humanity and goodness of human beings. In contrast, Theophanes was very cynical about human beings' true nature, because they allowed Jesus Christ to be crucified and Judas was able to betray him, so ""evil is all around."" During his life, Andrei had to face situations that were challenging his faith. For example, the cruel order of the Grand Prince when he raged against innocent stone carvers, or persecutions of pagans. The most difficult time for Andrei's faith was during Tatars' invasion. Firstly, the invasion was not just Tatars' war against Russians, but it was a conflict between Russian and Russian as brothers, because the Grand Prince's own brother helped Tatars. Before the invasion, Andrei told Theophanes that people have to be reminded that they are people, they are Russians and they share one blood and one land. In the fifth episode, however, this belief could be easily broken by the brother's betrayal, which reminds us the act of Judas. Secondly, the invasion itself was very savage, because Tatars were killing everyone and demolishing the entire city. Even praying of the rest of the Vladimir residents in the temple did not help, Tatars were able to beat out its doors and kill the prayers. Andrei was witnessing how the icons he just finished painting were being destroyed, and, of course, it was painful for him to question if people really need the icons. Thirdly, he had to act against his principles of not to kill in order to save the life of the Yurodivy girl. He finally decided to stop painting and take a vow of silence. In my opinion, it was not just to atone for killing, but since he was very disappointed about people: ""I have nothing to talk about with people.""The final scene is probably the most intriguing part of the movie, because it connects all the seven episodes and helps us eventually to build the whole picture in our mind. The success of a boy, Boriska, who never had any idea of how to cast a bell, finally returns Rublev faith in people, because he could witness people's happiness when the bell ringed. Yes, there are hardships everywhere, but as long as there is a meaning in religious acts for people, Andrei is motivated to resume his art. Ability of Boriska, who was also full of doubts about his craft, to bring happiness to people turns to be a sign for Andrei. The moment of Andrei giving a hug to Boriska and supporting him is so powerful that it can pass on this enormous power to viewers.Briefly commenting on the cinematography, I should note the small budget allocated to the film that did not make it any worse. I am surprised how the filmmakers could animate the picture the way Hollywood movies with much greater budget and advanced technology rarely can. We could hear the true sounds of nature (fire, birds), and see its beauty (animals, woods) through black and white filming. This movie has a soul that we can feel through its atmosphere, emotions, honest acting that required many efforts, and thought-provoking, very interesting dialogs that involve philosophical and religious doubts.I would like to conclude my review with the citation of the movie's director Tarkovsky: ""Whether one wishes to fly before it has become possible, or cast a bell without having learned how to do it, or paint an icon - all these acts demand that, for the price of his creation, man should die, dissolve himself in his work, give himself entirely."" In the case of Andrei Rublev, the test of his faith only reinforced it and, therefore, contributed to his later work."
"Andrei Rublev is a celebrated 15th century Russian icon painter. This is a series of vignettes related to his biography. Honestly, I wouldn't have watched it if not for its inclusion in the top 250 list. It's definitely an academic necessity for any film fans. The first part has an adventurer test riding a hot air balloon while a superstitious mob rush to stop him. It's surreal and sets the tone of this movie as an ongoing tragedy. The second part is just as tragic. Andrei and his friends are traveling. They take shelter in a village where they are entertained by a jester. Soldiers arrest him for his dissident material. The third part is where I faded. While the first two parts laid down the tone, it doesn't explain our main characters. By the third part, I lose the thread to these characters. I'm not connecting with them. The movie gets epic in part five. It's definitely big and I think a horse gets killed for real. There are some eye-opening scenes and true devastation. Overall, this movie gives a general feel of the era. It lays out the never-ending Russian tragic sensibility. The missing part is that I lose the characters. I don't feel for them. If Russian cinema is your thing, this one is a must."
"First of all, this is a movie about the medieval age in Russia. It's about a dark and dangerous time. I wouldn't wish to be born at that period of time even to my worst enemy. The only island of stability and culture in that ocean of darkness is a Church institution.This movie is a set of episodes from around a life of famous icon painter, a monk Andrey Rublev. Yes, it is not exactly his life stories; these stories about a life of that time, about hideosity, about severity. There is much naturalism in it; but there's no ""too much"" naturalism feeling which leads to a poor style. You understand it while watching: this is the way that it was then, nothing more.It is a masterpiece of photography and scenery. A visual image settles firmly into my memory. It is a genius acting; even a small role of Yuri Nikulin is a diamond between other diamonds. Crowd scenes are really massive. Altogether, there is a complete diving into the atmosphere of the movie.I don't much connected with faith nor religion internally. It's not close to my feelings. But I don't think that the movie is about religious feelings. Also I do not know much about details of that period of time in Russia; but it's not really matters too, methinks. But I consider this movie as a genuine art, and I'm very proud that my homeland is a homeland for a such genius person as film director Andrey Tarkovsky.I heard that Tarkovsky was a kind of fanatic. I heard that for achieving maximum realism he allowed horses to break their legs due a filming process; or even some people accuse him in burning a cow alive during the battle scene of Golden Horde's warriors raid. I do not know how much truth are in that statements, and I wouldn't comment these no more. All I know that his fanaticism was well transformed into a great result which couldn't be achieved by anyone but him.My rate: 10/10"
"This film is one of the unchallengeable masterpieces of the cinema-Citizen Kane, The Leopard, The Children of Paradise, The first two Godfather films, Raging Bull, The Life of Colonel Blimp, Rules of the Game,Bondarchuck's War and Peace, Sunrise, Eight and a Half,Diary of a Country Priest, The General( Keaton's, not Boorman's), Vertigo, The Searchers- that are simply unassailable. To question the moral, aesthetic, and spiritual grandeur of this exquisite work of art, is to betray that one has something missing deep within ones soul, and to question its beauty betrays that one has no eyes. Has any film-maker ever come up with  scenes comparable to the casting of the great bell of Kiev, or the pagan witches sabbath? Has ANY film other than 2001, ended with such dazzling beauty as this?"
"I think that this was once a great film. At the time it was made it was... but time has passed, and as everything things, ideas, ... do get old. This has value for its antiquity, its influence on other film makers, and as a landmark of films. However I do think that this film is tedious, and somewhat outdated, and the cinematography is definitely is not great by the standards today. I mean mere balancing technology, sound design, etc. are just on a completely different level. As what comes to cruelty... I don't know (I'm a vegan for 12 years), people eat meat everyday, and animals do get tested with chemicals, I don't see why would this killing of animals for film be any different? Morality is only for human kind... and it is our debate, and no absolute conclusion will ever be reached. Yes the movie is good, (in a sense that Mona Lisa is great), but I would not be tempted to watch this movie ever again. Yes and f*ck religion."
"Presumably, the people rating this movie so highly have seen the cut version of this film.  I just saw the 205 minute version and was taken aback by the animal cruelty depicted in the film.  This is actual cruelty: not special effects.  A herd of computer generated burning cattle may be amusing at the beginning of Mars Attacks!, but this film contains an image of an actual cow having been set alight and jumping around!  Worse still a horse is, for some reason, shown falling down a narrow staircase and then actually stabbed to death with a spear, all for the camera!  And these are only the worst examples!  What kind of a disgusting mess is this?  Thank God that such things are not allowed to happen in movies today, as a matter of course. Disgusting!!!  There is literally no excuse for this!"
"This is the kind of movie that will stick with you long after the screen goes black. It's the kind of movie that will burst into your thoughts at various moments and attach itself to all other aspects of your life. It's the kind of movie that you will come back to again and again.You can describe ""Andrei Rublev"" in a variety of ways: a historical epic, an examination of the role of the artist in society, a scathing portrayal of communist authority, or my personal favorite - a journey of faith. ""AR"" is all these and more.Some people will complain that this film is non-linear, that there is no plot, instead you have 8 separate and, at first glance unrelated, subplots. But isn't this the story of life? When has life ever had a linear plot line? It is a series of experiences, memories, and emotions that, for the lucky ones, leads to some personal revelations.SPOILER: In this movie, that revelation comes with the casting of the bell. That Andrei witnessing a young boy whose ""Father taught him"" completing the biggest bell in all the country convinces Andrei that faith is enough and that art and the ability to create art is a gift from God.So much can be said of this movie and yet words aren't enough. So many great moments stick out to me... Andrei's face when the pagan girl swims by him in the river, the confrontation between Andrei and Kirill about Andrei wasting his gift, Andrei reading ""Love is patient, love is kind..."", and of course the full color epilogue, which after viewing misery and desperation for 3 hours seems something of a miracle. This scene puts the viewer in the position of the Russian peasant - living with suffering and destruction, surrounded by bleakness and desperation, black and white... and then to behold an icon - a glimpse of God's beauty and of His love... there are no words.This film is pure beauty. It is one of the greatest cinematic achievements of all time. It is, as with all Tarkovsky movies, a statement about the director himself - about his own doubts, angst, and guilt, and his own redemption in art and in God."
"How to describe in words all there is in this? I'm not sure, but I will give it a shot. This is the first piece by the director that I've seen. I don't know much about Russia, their history or the culture(which, I've come to realize, may be a prerequisite to follow it, at least being informed about the time and the place), and I haven't learned the language, but the subtitles(though I understand that apparently not everything is translated) certainly help. The plot is well-told. There is impressive imagery in this, both in the visuals and in the dialog. The latter holds truth and is well-written. Deep, poetic, haunting. The acting is magnificent. There are universal themes herein. The editing and cinematography are excellent. Neither leave much of anything to be desired. The war-scenes are an achievement... so much chaos on the screen, yet when we're meant to focus on something, we do, and anything that's supposed to be noticed, is. There is violent and/or disturbing, but none that felt gratuitous, material in this. There is some nudity in this, and it is not captured in a way as to conceal it. The Andrei Tarkovsky Collection DVD has several features, including interviews, and they are worth watching. I recommend this to anyone interested in the medium of film as an art form. 10/10"
"I watched Andrie Rublev two weeks ago, and I was shocked by it. This is a true epic. I put Andrie Rublev beside such classics as Citizen Kane, Bicycle Thief, Potemkin, Seven Samurai, The Godfather, 8 1/2, Vertigo, Tokyo Story, and 2001, so if you like any of these films, if you like philosophy, poetry or nature, I recommend you to watch this great film. A great film. 10 out of 10."
"What becomes most apparent during the watching of 'Andrei Rublev', is that director Andrei Tarkovsky seems to be in love with himself. Rarely have i seen such pretentiousness and pseudo intellectuality in a major motion picture, but Andrei Rublev is definitely up there as one of the highest in that regard.As usual in a Tarkovsky film, there is no conventional narrative in Andrei Rublev, thus making sure it is not personally accessible in any way. The film starts with a guy escaping in a hot air balloon while being chased by an angry mob of people. What does this scene mean? Nobody knows. But we can't understand it, so it must be art, right?? I reckon this is how many of these pretentious fanboys of this film view this matter. What Tarkovsky is doing in this entire film does not require any kind of imagination or creativity. He loosely creates short stories which have no cohesive connection with eachother, and he implements a lot of random dialogue or events that make it seem like it is actually a very clever film, while in reality it is devoid of all substance. A film that is not decipherable does not automatically make it 'art'. It just makes it meaningless, devoid of life & empty. Of course, all Tarkovsky films have this narcissistic kind of pretentiousness ( Even a good movie like Solaris ), but it is in this case painfully obvious that is is purely there to cover up the creative and emotional emptiness that this motion picture is full off.Having seen the full 205 minute version of Andrei Rublev, it also became quite clear that there were numerous scenes and shots that simply held no value at all. The intro as stated before is an example, but there was also a shot of a horse tripping ( Which made no sense whatsoever ), the actual stabbing of an actual horse during one of the Tartar invasion scenes ( Which also made no sense ), and the fact that the final hour of the film suddenly brings forth a character nobody has seen before building a bell ( Again, there is very little structure at work here ). It is true that some of the shots during this final hour are phenomenally choreographed and created, also featuring a lot of dynamic crane camera movements which truly do make me wonder about how that was shot, but again, in substance, it is lacking severely. Not to mention the weird 15 minute outro by showing colorized iconographs. There's no doubt that pseudo intellectuals and self proclaimed 'film buffs' will find some hidden meaning there, but there really isn't any.Tarkovsky uses a lot of biblical quotations and uninspired pseudo intelligent dialogue to make sure people are fooled into thinking this empty lifeless exercise in his narcissistic nature can be considered 'art'. With people today claiming that everything can be art according to the person in question, this is something that's not very hard to do. The truth is, not everything can be art, and Andrei Rublev is one of them, as it is the equivalent to a modern painting with 2 lines on it being called 'innovative', 'daring' & 'genius'. Both have no meaning.Even though Tarkovsky is not necessarily a bad director, it's obvious that his self indulgent and narcissistic nature got the better of him for most of his films, thus creating 'Andrei Rublev', a pure exercise in subjective self-indulgence and wannabe art, which holds no actual value in quality apart from some technical brilliances."
"For his cinema perhaps all has been written, a dozen books at least. With only his second feature he was where other filmmakers would be at the end of their careers. A vision of how to see the world fully formed as its own chapter of cinematic history, where a tappestry rich in spiritual textures is entered and abandoned at will, the frame experienced then as disparate planes of existence which overlap, supersede and inform one another. His masterstroke is the removal of the cut, whereby essentially different scenes can now be read as a flow of life. And again in how reality is understood as a continuum that flows in and out of the mind, where shadows and reflections manifest where they shouldn't be.This is the first point I stand on, that Tarkovsky's world in this film cannot be fathomed outside of the mind, without the shadows it casts around us. The mind is then a fundamental tool where the formations of life begin.The existential problem posited by the film is how man, who is shown to be small and incomplete himself, can muster strengths and passions to complete a world left incomplete by creation. Having started out as mere characters in the middle point of this narrative we call life, how to become authors who can understand what has been created in order to write the chronicle of it. How to paint the face of god? And how to meditate on that struggle in film? Into this terrifying dilemma of existence, which is the quest for meaning and pattern, he places the artist with the divine spark, he who must paint the face of god. This is the starkest contrast of the film, the mechanism that drives it forward, how this humble man can accomplish this great spiritual task in a godless world where the face of god is precisely absent. It's not strange then that the icons of the Orthodox church portray Christs as lean, stoic figures. Suffering in this part of the world which now and then Attilas and Khans devastate it, is to be abided as the only mandate of god. Art then imitates life, these faces who must survive in the wastes, elevating it to a representation of the divine.We see the artist suffer a crisis of conscience at the face of this violence, a refusal to be the divine vehicle anymore. How Tarkovsky resolves this crisis is where the film falters for me.In watching a young boy cast a bell, a holy fool who succeeds against all odds, his faith is restored. Having wandered the latter part of the film a pathetic, passive figure of silence, he is made whole again by this meaningful, but chance event. The tools then by which we can understand meaning and purpose to life are not discovered inside, through a stillness of mind and right concentration (which in meditation is experienced as the appearance and disappearance of forms, leading at the ultimate stages to the disintegration of the mind and body), but rather are encountered as apparitions.Whether or not then god speaks through the ringing of that bell, the echo of it reveals the men who created it to be still small, prone to the same despairs and suffering. Essentially humans, aching for salvation in an ugly world. How to transcend then this mortality, the need for salvation which is a form of clinging that clouds the soul, this much remains outside the movie's interests. For that we'll have to go ahead to Solyaris."
"foremost I should add that this is the first Tarkovsky film I have ever seen, & though I do not think it would be the best introduction into his work (the version I saw clocked in at over 3 hours & from what I've read that's it isn't the longest, which may seem tedious to first time viewers), I really have no right to comment, being the only movies of his I have seen are this, Stalker & Solaris. Personally I am an enthusiastic lover of period pieces, particularly the ones with the best ""brush strokes"" as i like to call them. This film was hands down one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen.Two of my most favorite filmmakers are Stanley Kubrick & Akira Kurosawa. I believe Tarkovsky belongs in the top league with the latter two along with Ingmar Bergman, Orson Welles & Alfred Hitchcock, amongst others. These filmmakers truly capture the artistic side of film-making while providing enough to tantalize our senses (breathtaking imagery, amazing direction, grade A acting, etc) There is too much going on this film for me to review. I will most definitely have to watch it again. Plus enough have commented enough to provide readers with enough insight IMHO.If you appreciate films from such aesthetic (non-Tarkovsky) period pieces as Kagemusha, Barry Lyndon, Chimes At Midnight, or appreciate Tarkovsky's other works, than this is most worthy of a look."
"Possible Spoilers.The first time I saw this film I fell asleep after the first fifteen minutes. I decided to give this film another chance and I am very thankful that I did for it remains one of the five best films I have ever seen. It is hard to define this film. It is frightening, spooky, awe-inspiring, horrifying and incredibly dream-like. Ultimately, ANDREI RUBLEV is not necessarily about the title artist. For many, Andrei Rublev is about the artistic spirit of the 15th century painter. This spirit is manifest in various fictional and non-fictional figures placed within Rublev's time period. Several of these individuals include a bell-maker, a jester, a group of pagans, and Rublev himself. The movie highlights the fact that the path of the artist is not always an easy one. Even thought the artist may experience various tribulations and successes, he or she must try not to disregard the talent possessed. Rather, the artist must continue to create beauty within a world that is characterized by hatred, killings, and religious intolerance. The nature of the artist and his responsibility toward the community is perhaps the theme that most pervades and unites the film, and almost every episode presents at least some variant of it. The balloonist in the prologue takes the risks every true artist must take in stepping beyond the boundaries of the known, and challenging the fear and conformism of the people he wishes to benefit. The jester embodies the creative spirit of the people and their resistance to authority (religious and secular). Kirill represents the untalented artist and although he is untalented and jealous, he is aware of how the artist should endure and pleas with Rublev to resume his vocation. Rublev, in contrast to his three partners (Daniil, Kirill, and Theophenes the Greek), has genuine love, humility, and self-effacement, putting himself at the service of God and man. During the film Rubilev tries to forge a style that allows him to express his love for humanity. In essence, Tarkovsky wants the viewer to realize what the true artist represents and (from Tarkovsky's point of view) Andrei Rubilev represents the true Russian artist."
"Yes it was beautiful, but it's just arrogant to make it that long. I'm sorry but I had to stand up and leave after more than two hours (knowing there was still one hour more to go). For me this was the best part of my experience, going out of the cinema alone, in a cool summer evening directly to St. James's Park in London, liberating myself from the monotony and dullness of the film and becoming impregnated with the fragrance and colour in the park. I could only bear it until just after the invasion, I've read that there was colour afterwards and maybe my experience would have changed, but i believe that whilst you cannot intend to summarise any piece of Beethoven's work in a two minute radio version, this film could have been shorter because the viewer deserves respect and his time is valuable."
"An extraordinary film. In Tarkovsky's typical and very necessary slow pace. Tarkovsky gives us time to contemplate. This film is based on historical facts and events around the period and life of Russian icon painter Andrei Rublev. Symbollically this film starts with a man accomplishing the miracle of taking flight, a very haunting scene. The struggle throughout the film is for the human spirit to take flight. What does it mean to be human? How do we differ from beast? This film is a great Religious experience. This film is a pilgrimage. Also a very convincing portrayal of medieval times. My friend and I have watched this film more often than most people would."
"Andrei Tarkovsky's great epic is about events that occurred in and around the life of the 15th century Russian icon painter Andrei Roublev. It is not about the life of Roublev himself and, unlike other films about artists, it is certainly not about Roublev in the act of creation. Tarkovsky saves his creations to the end of the film in a series of tableaux in colour, (the film is in black-and-white), of Roublev's genius. Divided into a series of chapters, it touches on those significant events to which Roublev was a witness and although the historical episodes are presented with an uncanny attention to detail, it is more with the spiritual and metaphysical elements that Tarkovsky concerns himself.Roublev's journey through life is a deeply religious one but he is continually questioning and rediscovering his faith. His own inherent goodness is tested by the evils of the world around him. Even within the enclosed order of monks there is jealousy, envy, arrogance and doubt; so rather than being an account of the life of Roublev the film can be seen as a discourse on the thoughts and beliefs of it's creator.In cinematic terms it is an extraordinary amalgam of form and ideas. Tarkovsky composes the film with the bravura of an old master, (you can see the influence of Ford as well as Eisenstien in the compositions). Films made today just don't measure up. Made in 1966, Tarkovsky made no concessions to either popular taste or to the direction which international cinema was going. It is, on the one level, art-house cinema of a deeply reflective kind while on another level it is an accessible historical epic that works on a visual, as well as a visceral, level. Mind-blowing in the very best sense of the word."
"Although this movie is named after the artist Rublyov, and the protagonist name is Andrei Rublyov, it has nothing to do with biography. It is no documentary either. This is an expression of Russian common man belief, that no matter how dull and ugly life can be the soul is what matters only. So it is wrong to consider the movie as a historic one, it is an allegory of Russian reality what it was, is and will be.I have seen most of Tarkovsky's movies and this is the easiest one to understand. It has a simple one-sentence message and it is repeated in every episode ""Russian reality may be mud and misery, but greatness is to be sought in the beauty of human soul"".For every one that consents with such a message, this movie is a poem.For the ones that disagree it is dull and boring."
"""Andrei Rublev"" is undoubtedly considered as a masterpiece of the Soviet cinematography created by Andrei Tarkovsky. The movie tells the story about Andrei Rublev, showing his life path, his thoughts, feelings, concerns, and contradictions he had on his way of becoming the famous icon-painter of the Medieval Russia. The movie encompasses the period between 1400 and 1423 which is one of the most difficult times for Russian Empire and its people. Taking into account the historical aspects, the movie could accurately depict the unfortunate plight of Russian people by showing the scenes of Tartars' raid on the city of Vladimir, the coming of the famine and plague. Throughout these scenes, the movie is smoothly accompanied by Andrei's reflections about the sin, the God, and the essence of being, that makes the movie thought-provoking for its audience. From the first scenes, it is difficult to follow the idea behind this movie and some scenes are very confusing, however, with the gradual flow of the plot, you start to find the answers and understand the plot little by little. 
Questions that come to the mind after watching this movie is how to find the true essence of the life, how to believe in the existence of God when you think that God left you with the unfortunate destiny and challenges of life. Andrei Rublev is not presented just as an ordinary monk who paints icons in monasteries, it is the character who falls into personal quest of seeking to the unity with God and finding own ""calling"". 
It is shown in the movie that ordinary people, peasants went through many sufferings. The world is full of cruelty and sufferings at that period of time. Andrei Rublev also suffers from this, he does not know how to endure this heavy burden, which affected his paintings and personal thoughts. Gradually, movie reveals the true essence of Rublev, he thinks and grieves a lot, he is unable to find his true self nor to understand his true talent gifted to him from God. He thinks deeply about the good and evil, about the sins, God and about ordinary people who forced to live such unfortunate lives, and those who have sinned against God. He saw many people, their actions during the Tartars' raid, pagan feast, and he gradually became disappointed in people due to their lechery and sins. Rublev also admits that people are ignorant. But despite all of this, we can feel Rublev's love toward a human being and especially Russian people and his belief in the unity with God. He says in the dialogue with Theophanes the Greek that even though ""Russian people suffer from Tartars' raids, famine and plague, but they are working very hard bearing their cross with humility. They never despair, but endure their sufferings silently, and only after praying to God to give them more strength, the Almighty can forgive them their ignorance"" (Tarkovsky, 1966). That shows the importance of believing in God and praying to him even in the hardest times of life. However, Rublev still finds himself in conflict, in the struggle with himself as he finds himself as a sinner after killing man. He gives a vow of silence and falls into a personal quest of seeking the answers from God and unity with him. 
Tartars' raid on the city of the Vladimir, destroying the cathedral describe the cruelty of human beings and shows the godlessness. Here comes the notion of desperately finding the God: how to find consolation and salvation, to what believe in when everything is surrounded with aggression that makes you think that God left you. The construction of the bell in the last chapter is a very important scene here. The bell is like the divine presence, like the place where you can find the God and unify with him leaving all your sufferings behind. The last chapter is also crucial as it makes to realize that not only the seeking of God and the meaning of life is important but also finding your ""calling"" is essential for human being. Only after seeing that Boris, the person who falsely claimed to know the secret for constructing the holy bell, could build the bell that made him to have the real talent for casting bells, Andrei understands the importance of his own talent to the humanity and accepts God's gift and finds his calling for painting icons in Trinity. 
This epic masterpiece does not just show the pathway of Andrei Rublev in becoming the well-known icon-painter in Russian history, but also it delivers to the audience the importance of finding the true meaning of life, finding the God and unify with him and finding your own purpose, your true ""calling"" in life. This movie makes to realize that even if you have sinned against God, or you are going through many challenges in your life, you need to believe in God and believe in the unity with God. The movie provokes its audience to think about your own faith and ponder many things."
"Russian state at the beginning of the XV century. The country is torn apart by different ruling elites of regions. Tatars' raids, famine and epidemy are pursuing the people. In this tragic period, a great icon painter appears in Russia, the plot of the picture is fully dedicated to the life and fate of the legendary Andrei Rubilov. He is an itinerant monk, traveling around Russia and observing life and human morals. Information about him is scarce and sketchy. Nevertheless, the filmmakers sought to recreate the spiritual world of Andrei Rubilov. 
The film carries a lot of deep meaning and gives the atmosphere to everything that happens. At the early beginning of the picture simple Russian men think of a flight. Despite the obscurity in the country, oppression of free thinking, people are living a creative life. One interesting point, on the boat to the place where ball is built in a hurry the man Yefim sails. His first words: ""Come quickly, hurry up!"" In my point of view, these guys clearly know that what they do is strictly persecuted and forbidden. Nevertheless, they do their job, and the ball, despite the sailing archers, flies quite well. Yefim flies over the fields, rivers. He opens the boundless landscape of the Russian land. Yefim laughs, laughs like a child - he is embraced by joy, a sense of freedom. 
The filmmaker beautifully depicts the image and transmission of the life of the peasants, where at any moment the scene can be joyful, and it can be sad. The movie is divided into five chapters, first of them entitled ""Skomoroh"" or in other words ""holiday"" and introduces us into the joyful life of the peasants with their songs with traditional dances and humor. At that time moment Andrei Rubilov confronted the Tatar raid on the city of Vladimir, they severely destroy the facilities and oppress the Russian people. Experiencing the true tragedy and deep moral crisis in XV century Russia Andrei Rubilov fell into deep concern how to withstand all this kind of turmoil and how to turn the people's mind and make them a little more moral. 
That scene and moral sufferings of Andrei Rubilov is beautifully shown in the chapter entitled ""Passion according to Andrei."" For certain time of moment legendary painter could not find his true passion, and frequently questioning his true talent - is this God gift or this is illusion? Generally asserting, this chapter includes all the main ideas that are important for understanding the work and aspiration of Andrei Rubilov, why he is striving to attain his life goals and what is the price of his all these sufferings for moral virtue. Eternal thoughts about good and evil, sin and God, disgusting qualities of humankind such as cruelty and immorality are all the part of this section of the movie. Despite these all turmoil situation in Russia, Andrei Rubilov shows his true love toward a Russian people and land, which in its he shows his consent to endure all confusions just in order to preserve the Russian identity. Indeed, the filmmaker by this passage delivers to us the true moral of a successful human existence which only could become possible through true love and enduring all the hardships in the name of maintaining your nations identity and land. 
During such hardship times Russian people seek to help from God, as I mentioned before in order to sustain their national identity and land. However, the scene with the invasion of Tatars is the apogee of showing godlessness, cruelty and greediness of Russian people, and it shows why Russian people seek help from God only when they had experienced turmoil. Andrei Rubilov does not stand aside during this hardship period of Russian history, he helps people to turn their faith toward God and morality through his works such as icon painting. 
At the last section of the movie, the cast bell plays significant symbolic importance. The joy of his ringing in people symbolizes, even a temporary, but still true connection of Russian people with God during the hardships. In my perspective, by the construction of huge bell want to show the greatness and unity of man with God. From the movie director's perspective, it seems to me that regardless of how hard it would be, no matter what awaits a person on his life's journey, human's faith to God would definitely help him to overcome trails at any moment and therefore, the unity of person with God is the meaning of life. 
To conclude, this movie in religious perspectives very simple and at the same time complex, meaningful picture, imbued with humanism and love towards your nation and your motherland. The film accurately conveying the spirit of the age and the spirit of Andrei Rubilov, and his quest for moral virtue. Moreover, the picture amazingly portrayed the controversial world called as unity with God and humankind's own destiny."
"Tarkovsky's magnum opus. Made way back in 1966, the visuals are still awe inspiring. An epic retelling of the life of the painter-monk set in turbulent medieval Russia. Tarkovsky paints Rublev as almost an Christ-like figure who repents for the sins mankind commits and uses themes of artistic freedom, religion, art under authoritarian regime. Controversial at the time of it's release, a strong spiritual movie from the atheistic USSR, today this is an undisputed Masterpiece. Arguably the Russian Auteur's best work."
"Besides its depth and breadth of concern, 'Andrei Rublev' is known for the diversity and extremity of its divergences. More than a historical biography or period drama, it is a collection of moments that can be encountered both in their own right and as figurations. Over the course of three hours, we actually meet more or less three semi-protagonists, most notably Rublev himself, but memorably, too, the young bellmaker, Boriska, whose 'stingy' father has left him 'without the secret' of his trade, but who nonetheless successfully manages to cast the bell, in the final episode. Through these various characters we are confronted with not History, but history in the lower-case: people shaping a passage through time, sometimes confounded, sometimes redeemed.With 'Andrei Rublev,' Tarkovsky was consciously crafting a language that owed nothing to literature, and it's a pity so few others followed him. In today's cinema, we're still served up linear, cause-and-effect biographies of artists as if, by doing so, we'll understand the person and be able to make sense of their art. Andrei Rublev operates according to a different understanding of time and history. It asks questions about the relationship between the artist, their society and their spiritual beliefs and doesn't seek to answer them. 'In cinema it is necessary not to explain, but to act upon the viewer's feelings, and the emotion which is awoken is what provokes thought,' wrote Tarkovsky in 1962.'I think there exists a law: author cinema is made of poets and all great directors are poets.' 'Andrei Rublev' is an example, perhaps the most important, of Tarkovsky's commitment to a formal 'poetics' of cinema. Its nonlinear narrative structure, the metaphorical interrelation of images, and its symbolism make for less a story about an event than a way of experiencing events interact. Ingmar Bergman remarked that Tarkovsky was 'the greatest' because he 'invented a new language, true to the nature of film, as it captures life as a reflection, life as a dream.'More than this, though, what we sit through is not some abstraction of reality into reverie, but an attempt to think through this conflict: the cold fact of the world and our mediated experience of it. In the end, Rublev resolves to paint again. He comforts the bellmaker, Boriska, who is overwhelmed by the solitude of his achievement: 'What a great joy for all men. You gave them such a great happiness: and you cry? Stop it!' 'Andrei Rublev' is worthy of remembering not because it collapses life into art, but because it attempts to imagine how art can be life's witness. Hence, Tarkovsky's observation: 'Art would be useless if the world were perfect, as man wouldn't look for harmony but would simply live in it.'10 out of 10."
"I never expected action scenes in a Tarkovsky movie! This is probably the most dynamic and diverse movie from his entire filmography!
Deep, epic, emotional, meditative atmosphere, shocking scenes, philosophical themes, subtle dialogue scenes, stunning visuals; I'm telling you... this is the opposite of boring!"
"I recently had the pleasure of my first viewing of Andrei Tarkovskys 1966 masterpiece, ""Andrei Ruvlev"", which ultimately had quite an impression on me.It is the most visually moving film I've seen. Until Rublev, I didn't truly understand how stunning and engaging a film could be. The vignettes of Russian life are very thought-provoking, the cinematography the best I've seen, and the result is a film that moves me every time I watch it.There's this one bit where the pagans are all naked and you get to see, like, maybe 20 naked women, but they're sort of in the distance so you don't really get a proper look, but if you rewind and pause there's some frames that are pretty good and none of them are all that old or anything so it's pretty awesome. Then there's this bit where some guy is tied up and the leader of the women comes in and she strips off and you can totally see her boobs and theyre really nice and then she wants to make love to the man but he's not into it so she unties him and lets him go.Approach it with an open mind, and be prepared for a slowly unfolding story. Do this, and you'll be deeply rewarded and satisfied in a way that few films will ever match. There are no cliches here, no stereotypes and no sucking up to the audience. A brutally honest and yet very moving, touching and optimistic film. And it is not about the nature of a genius. Rather, it is about a man's ability and duty to preserve and be true to his humanity, his freedom, his soul, his heart and his gift, no matter what century it is or what the circumstances are. Watch it to remind yourself of what it really means to be human.10 Stars."
"I have been watching foreign movies for more than 2 years and using IMDb for over 3 years but i had never a chance or the temptation to write a review but this movie...Tarkvosky's ingenious Anderi Rublev made me to write a review about it. Anderi Rublev is a kind of cinema which will make you feel like a human,like an organism who has the ability to enjoy a thing called film. This movie has everything that you have not seen or did not have the chance of experiencing...this movie has some breath taking scenes and sentences. At last i'd say that if you ever have 3 hours free in your lifetime and have an inner most hidden wish to see some quality stuff then choose this movie. Thanks"
"A truly unique movie, the closest you'll get to seeing Breughel or Hieronymus Bosch in cinema. Tarkovsky shows us the life and times of Russian painter Andrei Rublev (±1365-1430) in a way that only Tarkovsky can, his trademark meandering camera hypnotizing the viewer, enabling an almost meditative state that allows us to gain deep insights into art, religion and the human condition. Parts 4, 6 and 8 in particular are fantastic, revealing the chaos and trials of medieval Europe in haunting fashion. The payoff comes in the form of the gorgeous, timeless finale - so well executed.Still, this is not as perfect a work as Stalker or Solaris. I found parts 5 and 7 to be outright boring, perhaps because some orthodox religious themes were lost on me. But these are minor quibbles - take your time to absorb this movie, even if you don't consider yourself the type to enjoy 3 hour allegories about obscure Russian icon painters. For better or for worse, it will be a once in a lifetime experience."
"Andrei Tarkovsky is one of my favorite filmmakers of all time. His films evoke mysterious feelings that I rarely find in other movies. Not only do his films have impressive cinematography, but they also come with grand stories despite how simple they seem at first. Since this film was over 3 hours, I was a little concerned that I'd have trouble getting into it. However, I found it to be a truly engaging experience.A couple decades in the life of the famous medieval Russian painter Andrei Rublev is depicted in this epic. We see his interactions between other painters, buffoons, pagans, and Tatars. These experiences shape and influence his actions over the course of the film.I first began to pick up on the movie's themes when I asked the question: What caused Andrei to refuse to paint the church walls in Chapter 5? When I re-watched the movie with this in mind, I began to see the movie as a representation of dehumanization. In several of the opening chapters, Andrei witnessed many people either get beaten or killed. He also witnessed several bizarre sites such as seeing a group of naked pagans running through the woods. These experiences effected him in many ways such as how he refused to decorate the walls of a church or how he murdered a Tatar to save someone during a raid. With this, Tarkovsky is saying that the brutality of the world caused Andrei to lose interest in painting.I also liked the prologue and the final chapter of the film. At first glance, the prologue felt misplaced as the characters in the opening scene were never seen again. However, I think Tarkovsky did this on purpose as he was trying to let the audience know that this was one of the films' most vital scenes. I've seen a few theories on what purpose the opening serves. Some people said that it exists to introduce us to the brutality of the world. My interpretation, however, is that it and the final chapter serve as bookends to Andrei's journey. The opening scene depicts a man named Yefim escape an angry crowd in a hot air balloon only to crash and, presumably, die. The final chapter shows a boy named Boriska attempt to build a bell for the Grand Prince. The thing that Yefim, Andrei, and Boriska have in common is that they are all artists and visionaries in some way as they attempt to overcome odds to create something awe-inspiring. Both of these men bookend Andrei's journey. Yefim represents the death of an old artist while Boriska represents the birth of a new artist. Near the end of the film, Andrei comforts Boriska after he admits that his father never told him the secret to building bells. I interpreted this scene as Andrei trying to encourage the boy to remain interested in art, so he could eventually replace him.Tarkovsky usually handles dialogue exceptionally. If I pay close attention to the dialogue in his films, I find a lot of it to be thought provoking and powerful. There were many great lines of dialogue in this film. The first great scene of dialogue is in Chapter 3. In it, Andrei has a conversation with Theophanes, another famous Russian painter. Their dialogue shows the main difference between them. During their conversation, Theophanes says ""People will lump the blame for their sins on one another...will be justifying themselves before the almighty."" Andrei replies to him with ""I don't understand how you can paint, having thoughts like that."" This scene shows the personality traits of both men. I explained earlier how this film is based heavily on dehumanization. Their conversation is a great representation of this. The reason Theophanes has these thoughts while Andrei doesn't is because Theophanes is much older than Andrei. He has seen more of the world's brutality. Andrei hasn't seen enough of it yet to relate to Theophanes' world views. Another great scene of dialogue happens in Chapter 6. After Andrei survives a raid, he encounters the ghost of Theophanes. Andrei tells Theophanes that he is disgusted by how he killed a Tatar during the raid. He mourns the loss of his work and the evil in the world he lives in. He may not have agreed with Theophanes in Chapter 3, but later on, he eventually concurs with him. The reason for this change is because the numerous instances of brutality Andrei encountered caused him to become dehumanized over time.The cinematography was also haunting. A lot of classic movies which were praised for their haunting cinematography back in the day don't unsettle me that much. However, there were some legitimately unnerving moments in this movie which held up pretty well. Most of them were in Chapter 6. Some scenes which stood out from that sequence was how liquid metal was poured into someone's mouth, when a horse fell down a flight of stairs, when a cow was lit on fire, and, like I mentioned earlier, the conversation between Andrei and Theophanes. There's also numerous shots of horses which Tarkovsky said were a symbol of life, the most famous of which occurs at the final shot.In my review of ""Stalker"", I compared Tarkovsky to Stanley Kubrick, my favorite filmmaker, by calling him the ""Russian Kubrick"". I feel like this is a valid comparison, because both filmmakers create movies with simple, yet grand stories. The more I watch Tarkovsky's films, the more this viewpoint gets enforced. ""Andrei Rublev"" sets itself apart from other movies based on true stories due to its thematic power on dehumanization, which is carried from the first half to the next."
"Where do I begin? The wonderful B&W photography, the hypnotic camera movement, the incredible production design, the cruelty that this beauty finally depicts; Tarkovsky is an Orthodox saint. Here's a proof that god lives in arts and art is in the cinema. This is a masterpiece on pair with its subject's works. Tarkovsky is Rublev."
"It's not a biography by any means, it's largely fiction - it's only loosely based off Rublev's life. The film focuses more on his dedication to Eastern Orthodoxy, as well as its role in his evolution as an artist. There are certain characters that each represent different philosophical outlooks under a single unanimous religious belief. In particular, Theophanes is an interesting take on someone being God-loving yet simultaneously overly cynical in his repulsion by His man's vile nature. Outside of characters, the story is alright. The second half is mostly boring in my opinion. Being shot in black and white to emphasize the colorful ending - no doubt to add ""life"" to the conclusion - is kind of gimmicky, but otherwise a decent film."
"""Agreed-upon"" to be one of the cinema's masterworks, ""The Passion According to Andrei"" or simply ""Andrei Rublev"" revolves around the life of Russia's 15th-century great icon painter. The unique and great Tarkovsky carried the idea of this film from the first beginning, even before finishing his first film ""Ivan's Childhood"". Yet, after a single premiere screening in Russia (Dom Kino) in the year 1966, the film did not get a public release. Tarkovsky's masterpiece struggled for years in the Soviet Union and upon releasing it in December 1971 there were several cuts applied to it, where it was shown in the 186-minute version (the original was 205 min. long). Before that in 1969, the film was requested for Cannes Film Festival where it won the FIPRESCI prize, and from there on it was widely regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time.Rublev's character appears for the first time leaving the Trinity monastery with two other monks to search for work in Moscow. At the end of the movie, Rublev goes back to the same monastery, where he began his journey, to paint his ""Holy Trinity"". Between this and that, Rublev accomplished his spiritual journey and found his voice (innerself) not between the walls of monastery, but in the harsh circumstances of life back then. The film indeed shows little about Andrei Rublev himself and yet in a way shows a lot. As always Tarkovsky surprises his audience. The biographical film does not tell us about Rublev in the traditional meaning of the word, since he is most of the times a witness of what was going on and a passive observer. Yet, it tells us more about the interaction of this personality with existence, life, and with the conditions and occurrences of his time. In fact, Tarkovsky's psychological stance and spiritual meditation had to do a lot with the result of this film. That is why many regarded it as an allegory to Tarkovsky's own struggles in Russia or with his own-self. It is then the passion according to both Andrei Rublev and Andrei Tarkovsky.The film is divided into eight chapters (with a prologue and epilogue) each with a unique title. The opening scene starts with a prologue of a hot air balloon ride. Some consider this amazing scene as an allegory to our spiritual relationship with the ""world of appearances"". It may also seem an allegory to the struggles of the innovative, the spiritual, and the human in general with the circumstances life presents. Well, it may also mean both; since Tarkovsky uses powerful images that carry lots of meanings to evoke our emotions and drive us to react to them from our perspective. A horse (to Tarkovsky it resembles life) is seen collapsing. Rublev then is shown leaving the monastery.. the journey begins.Envy, desire, love, betrayal, freedom, faith.. wars and tortures and murders and struggles all of which Rublev feels and witnesses, and so he'd be greatly affected. He becomes disturbed and shaken.. and undergoes a vow of silence until he finds his faith again. Then, after seeing a boy achieve by faith what he was incapable of by knowledge, Rublev finds himself again in a moment of inspiration. Now we're ready to see Rublev's work in detail.. the film concludes with horses standing peacefully (the only scene shot in colors alongside Rublev's frescoes).The film's spirituality offended many officials, its depiction of Russia's history offended many nationalists, and its boldness offended some of the religious. Yet, Tarkovsky was not trying really to take sides or attack or criticize anyone. He was just being Tarkovsky.. the genius.. with his thoughts and emotions. He was presenting from what he deeply felt a piece of art."
"In 1966 Andrei Tarkovsky directed Andrei Rublev, also known as The Passion according to Andrei. The film loosely depicts the life of Andrei Rublev, an early 15th century monk who is renowned as Russia's greatest creator of religious icons and frescoes. Tarkovsky used this historical figure to anchor the film in one of Russia's most tragic period, making Andrei Rublev not only a witness of his Time but also depicting the artist's creation process, the importance of his faith, the Loss of it and more importantly how the two (Art and Faith) can help go through event you can't really grasp or even understand. The complexity of the film as well as the political implications explain why Andreï Rublev was not released in an atheist USSR until 1971 and in a censored version mind you.The film starts with a prologue where we see a man call Yefim taking off from the roof of a church in a hot air balloon and escaping a mob trying to prevent the Take-off. Yefim seems highly exited and delighted by the sight he experiences from the air; but as the air balloon crashes, we understand that elevation in this obscurantist time is not going to be easy. We fall before we reach enlightenment. This is our Human Condition, this is what Life is about and the shot of a Horse lolling in the grass by a river bank epitomizes Life, its struggle and its beauty. This prologue summarizes metaphorically the seven chapters that follow narrating the trepidations of Andrei Rublev looking for elevation and falling back into his Human condition.For Andrei Rublev, Faith and Art are intimately linked, he paints religious icons and frescoes because he believes this is his priesthood the only way he can transmit his Faith to the people. Losing his Faith in Humanity might imply losing his Faith in God and so in Art. It's only when Andrei witnesses the casting of a bell that his life turns around. He meets the character of Boriska,the bell caster, another creative character a reminiscence of young Andrei and when Andrei sees the young Boriska collapsing on the ground of fatigue and breaking into tears, he takes him in his arms to comfort him and break his vow of silence. He understands he is not alone struggling with the concept of artistic creation and Faith as both (the young Boriska and the older Andrei) brought people so much joy. An artist with a vision can create and eventually echoes god's power of creation by using his or her technical skills but more importantly his or her heart and Faith.The ""tour de force"" of Andrei Tarkovsky is to use the same creative process than the one of his film's protagonist. By putting his heart and soul in the core of his cinematographic technique he transcends the genre and the medium. We understand that ""in cinema it is necessary not to explain, but to act upon the viewer's feelings, and the emotion which is awoken is what provokes thought"". To this respect Andrei Rublev is a film to experience and I humbly suggest we experience it with our heart and soul."
"The only thing that you must understand about the Russians in literature and similar arts is that they are patient story tellers. Apparently all Russian novels show this when compared to the quick and explicit writing in the West. If you don't take this fact to heart Ivan Rublev will just be tedious and boring.This is the story of an artist, a painter of icons, and you will see the original icons in all their glory at the end of the film in a full color coda to the story. The artist lives in Russia, which is a vast, often swampy, land with bitter weather. The people, in this film, are clustered in islands of human society where people seem to have made a stand against the land and the weather. Between these islands there is very little and you can see what I mean in the second sequence of the film in which an obviously drafty barn serves as a shelter for dozens of peasants, monks, and entertainers. Outside there is nothing much until a handful of soldiers shows up to drag away one of the entertainers for no obvious reason, disappearing again into the winter pausing only to smash the jester's psaltery.We then meet and actually start to get to know the protagonist, Rublev in the third sequence, some twenty minutes into the story. We meet him at a monastery, which is another island in the landscape. At this monastery we also meet a Greek painter of icons who is also ah historical figure who will show up with his paintings on a Google search. At this point the story settles down and begins to unfold over the next three hours.Toward the end the film becomes a project film about the casting of a great bell, not in a factory but in the open with the work taking place with make shift equipment and a terrified overseer. He is afraid because, as is made perfectly clear in the film, he really knows very little about bell making and bragged his way into the job claiming to have inherited secrets from his father. The film ends with one of those long tracking shots for which Tarkovsky is justly famous.One might mention parenthetically that it appears that Tarkovsky's reputation for tracking shots made such shots a part of Russian films and culminated in a film called The Russian Ark, which is one long uninterrupted tracking (and wandering) shot of the Hermitage museum in Saint Petersburg (Leningrad) where we have a tale woven of the palace and the residents as seen by an unidentified time traveler.At the end the screen floods with color and the icons themselves appear, not as a part of the story so much as an instructive historical footnote. The rest of the film is in black and white with, it seems to me, a sort of film noir approach to fifteenth century Russia."
"Given the superlative reviews here I was expecting something more from this film and in the end I was pleased with it but I didn't think it moved me as remotely as much as people here said it would. I would still say it was an excellent film, but I was disappointed since I was expecting a transcendental experience by watching this thing. Well, it was good but still flawed.One of the main problems of this film is pacing and editing. Yes, it is a bit too slow, not that it made it unwatchable, but simply because very slow is not always the best way to go. Sometimes a bit faster can help it. I mean, if they had edited out a bit 15 minutes of fat from this 205 minute film it would have been more powerful. Yes, the ending is very powerful, but not as powerful as I was expecting.Overall a very good film and everybody that calls himself or herself a film buff should see it, but don't expect that it is ""the greatest film ever"", it is ""only"" a great but flawed historical film. I would place it among my top 100 favorites but not among my top 20."
"Most viewers should think twice before trying to watch this film. It is not a story so much as a series of scenes recalled by memory- i.e. fuzzy, disjointed, and sentimentalised while still being personal. To say the film has a plot or story- per se- would be misguiding. Asking what purpose it does have is probably fairly misguided, as well. Like scenes from our own life, the scenes in this film just happen to us and we are the higher intelligence responsible for imposing order and specifying why they have happened or what they signify.Like impressionism in painting, Tarkovski's objective is to create works that directly interact with the human mind's tendency to convert symbols into emotion. The experiences and environment of Andrei Rublev's life is crafted for us by Tarkovski. The cruelty, hardship, and frank confusion of his life is patiently rendered by Tarkovski in his impressionistic style that seems oblique to ""conventional"" cinematic sensibilities but which is remarkably direct about evoking the desired emotional response. The film is replete with remarkable scenes- the balloon flight that opens the movie and the casting of the great church bell being two of the most memorable. The latter could be construed as either the power of an individual's vision or as what anyone can do when God wills it. Either interpretation would have inspired the creative efforts of any artist.Obviously, some cross-comparison with his other films should be in order. Solyaris (1972), his cult Science Fiction masterpiece is a marginally inferior film that still manages to be, for me, more satisfying because of my sentimental romantic tendencies that allow me to overlook the disjointed plot, poor editing in a few scenes, and the occasionally wooden or otherwise unconvincing dialogue. Andrei Rublev is better in most of these respects and is well photographed on a fairly consistent stock of Black-and-White film. Black and white definitely suit the movie, too- colour would have given the scenes too much ""presence"" and made them seem more mundane- black and white help preserve a sense of reverie. In both films, there is not great sense of urgency and scenes play out in their own (occasionally tedious) pace. Both films feel much more spontaneous to me than Tarkovski's last work- ""Sacrifice"" starring the great Erland Josephson and this seeming artlessness gives them a vitality that this last film lacks.In conclusion- this is a fine Tarkovski film. It is as good a film as any of his for introducing new viewers. Viewers should approach it with the proper mindset, however. Their objective should be to experience the film and their reaction to it. Obviously, interest in Russia around the 13th century will probably not hurt appreciation. While the film is, in its totality, different from most films, the individual scenes are not weird- no strange camera work, no sudden introduction of esoteric symbols, just fairly honest attempts to record an individual person's impression of what viewers today might find to be unusual experiences."
"Tarkovsky set out to make a landmark expression of cinematic art. Instead this movie will forever be known as ""that movie where the director shot a horse and lit a cow on fire"".Future filmmakers of the world, let this be a lesson to you. Don't let your arrogance get the best of you to the point that you start committing crimes against life. Josef Mengele, I'm sure, was an intelligent man with a thorough knowledge of medicine. But, like Tarkovsky, he'll forever be known as an arrogant psychopath with a thirst for blood.Suffice it to say that neither I nor any of my enlightened friends enjoyed this movie in the least. If you are intelligent enough to understand the words I have written here, then I guarantee that you will be just as repulsed by this film as we were."
"I cannot endorse this film due to its blatant hypocrisy. Here we have director Tarkovsky, moralist extraordinaire, attempting to tell a moral tale of righteousness and spiritual depth. But fans of this movie overlook the disgusting fact that Tarkovsky committed horrible, ghastly crimes in order attain his ""righteous vision"".Tarkovksy lights a cow on fire. Tarkovsky throws a horse down a flight of stairs. Tarkovsky has that horse speared to death at the bottom. These are not special effects. These are genuine acts of depravity. How, then, can this film POSSIBLY be applauded for its moralism? I much prefer the gratuitous animal killings in CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, because at least in that film we're under no premise that the director is sending us a lofty message of spiritual purity. Please, if you are a true art lover (meaning: one who interprets the depths of art to its very core), save yourself the horrible disappointment, and skip this flick."
"Andrei Rublev is the most boring movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Tarkovsky's use of abstract storytelling may work for some people, but it did not work for me. It didn't work for me here, and it didn't work for me in the last movie I watched of his called Stalker. Abstract storytelling can work in a specific context. Eraserhead comes to mind. But while that movie had the decency of now being very long and having plenty of striking visual imagery to keep me entertained, Andrey Rublev is essentially a slowly paced three hour drama, with no interesting story or characters at all.To really show what I mean by this I want to talk a bit about the last hour. The last hour is basically just a boy, whom we had never seen to this point and know nothing about, building a bell for a local prince. What?!?!The movie never spends time with its characters, not even the title one, so that we can get to know or care about them. The story is not told in any kind of a traditional sense, which as I stated earlier can work fine depending on the type of film, but when doing a biopic you wan't to stay a bit more on track."
"Russia have been responsible for some truly fine films, fantasy, animated or otherwise, but Andrei Rublev is truly something special. If there is a Soviet film more visually stunning, powerful, thought-provoking or emotionally profound than Andrei Rublev I've yet to see it. Sure, it may not appeal to all, there have been complaints about the animal torture/killings, the slow pacing and being perplexed by the symbolism but neither were problems for me(but if they are for anybody else that's understandable).Andrei Rublev looks absolutely stunning for starters, not just of any Soviet film but one of the most beautiful-looking films ever, every angle and frame is perfectly composed and with a hypnotic dream-like quality. The film also contains some of the most jaw-dropping and powerful symbolism of all of film, the casting of the bell was the standout with Rublev's colour montage close behind, but the snow crucifixion, the battle and the balloon flight were also memorable images. Tarkovsky's direction is just impeccable, so much so Andrei Rublev for me has to be one of the best-directed films there is. It's very thoughtfully scripted, the hauntingly exquisite music score is not one to forget, the pacing while deliberately slow beguiles rather than bores or frustrates and the story is powerful, inspirational(in how Rublev struggled to overcome the hardships he faces) and poignant. Not only that, but Russian medieval life has never been captured more authentically on film to the extent that the viewer is drawn right into this world, nothing idealistic or overly stylised here, this is compellingly hard-hitting stuff and not in a sadistic way(to me). Anatoli Solonitsyn commands the screen in the title role with vigour and emotional intensity while Irina Tarkovskaya is like a Russian Giulietta Masina(a regular Federico Fellini leading lady if you're not sure), and that's meant in a good way.Overall, majestic cinema(a phrase I very rarely use) and a film that film buffs must see if they haven't already. A very easy 10/10. Bethany Cox"
