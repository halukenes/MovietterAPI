Reviews
"Anything I say in this review is probably redundant, because there isn't a single negative review in all the comments so far here, and I agree wholeheartedly with what has been said by other reviewers.Nevertheless Hotel Rwanda is that rare kind of movie experience that doesn't easily relinquish its hold on the audience just because the credits have rolled. Watching with a friend, after ten minutes we had to pause the film because we decided we would be better served if we were more informed about what the basic facts of the conflict in Rwanda were. So to my shame, we had to read on the internet about what really happened, before we could continue. I say shame because we should have known, both of us were of an age when it happened to have taken more of an interest in world politics.The film is beautifully understated, eschewing sentimentality in favour of raw emotion and letting the story tell itself. The acting was flawless - Don Cheadle's breathtaking performance being a particular standout - and the direction didn't falter, despite all the potential pitfalls of dramatising a recent and horrific conflict. The scenes which were hardest to watch in terms of tension and violence were often suffused with humour and hope.It's difficult sometimes to separate the significance of the true story, from the artistry of the product, and often I get impatient with 'worthy' movies scoring big at Oscar time because it seems as though important stories ought to be rewarded, whether or not they make good films. However, I can't recall being so profoundly moved by a film since I saw The Grey Zone, and I hope Hotel Rwanda gets all the plaudits it deserves."
"I have never been so touched by a movie. It was the hardest movie I have ever sat through but also the best. it's so easy to ignore human rights abuses if they are not happening to you or your family, but just because you ignore it, they are still happening. i hope this movie receives the praise it deserves. i am frustrated because nothing i can type can represent how powerful this movie is or how much it moved me. i can't comment on the amazing acting or cinematography or directing because the movie transported me. i did not think about the making of the movie but rather sat shocked and horrified and nauseated and inspired. there was the red cross agent. there were heroes and while human nature perverts and the thin veil of culture unravels, there is still good. i have to look at the good of the heroes in the movie and of the people that wrote the movie, and realize that going to the movies doesn't have to be about escapism. it can be about reality. this is a must-see, not because it will make you laugh but because it will make you think and feel."
"I have no doubt that this is the only movie for the past year that can get me totally, if not 101%, emotionally involved. For other movies, I might be interacting with the story a lot , say associating my personal experiences with the characters, making judgment on them, criticizing the development of the story, ways of expression, the cinematography, acting, etc. BUT, Hotel Rwanda simply took me over as I was watching it. My emotion was going along with Paul ( Don Cheadle) all the time. The director did a great great job in capturing the feelings of people facing uncertainty, horror, ridicules, anger, death, waning faith... Family, life and dignity/integrity become the largest things in the situation. What's more is that it squarely shows the realist thinking in international politics.It honestly shows the weakness or helplessness of the UN and the non-governmental organizations. It truthfully tells how indifferent most of the international community (or individuals, which may or may not include you and me) are towards the deprivation of social justice taking place in other parts of the world. It makes you question to what extent that it is true to say what we see ( the sufferings in the world) is what we tolerate. It shows you how monstrous human being can be. It scares you how sanity would fail. At the same time, the uglier the people become, the more beautiful you find those who have managed to keep brave and maintain humanity. The movie fully succeeds in showing me the spirit, faith, and compassion that the world is dreaming for."
"The only comment I can give about this movie is - SEE IT. It's one of the most heart wrenching, yet beautiful movies I've ever seen. I really hope Don Cheadle and the movie receive Oscars! The acting is superb and the fact this is based upon a true story only makes it better. You may need some Kleenex as I was overwhelmed for a large part of this movie.I had the honor of seeing this movie at a preview screening with the real ""Paul"" and his wife attending - what an absolute amazing experience to be in their presence. This movie will make you rethink everything about what it means to be human and how much we need to think about all our neighbours in this world.Don't miss it!"
"I was fortunate to see this film at the Toronto Film Festival. I had heard nothing about this film before I read up on it in the Fest guide and originally was going to see something else. But, the subway happened to shut down and I was not going to be able to see the film I originally intended. So, I decided to give this a try.And I am so very glad I did.This film is by far the best drama I have seen all year, and indeed was the best film of the 11 I saw at the festival. It is gripping, heart-wrenching, and opens your eyes to so many things. Don Cheadle -- who I am a long time admirer of his work -- is phenomenal in the lead role, and I hope that he is nominated for Best Actor this year, because he certainly deserves it.I am recommending this film to everybody I know and I hope that it gets a wide distribution because it certainly is a film that needs to be seen. While comparisons can be made to Schindler's List, I think that this film goes further to show that events like the Holocaust can happen any time -- even now -- so long as people look away, just as the UN did in Rwanda. It certainly makes one think about how easy it is for us to forget our history and allow it to be repeated, because (as one character says) we will watch it on TV, say that it is terrible, and go right on eating our dinner. 10/10"
"I was fortunate to see it at the Toronto International Film Festival.Hotel Rwanda starred Don Cheadle and was directed by Terry George. It's based on a true event, about Paul Rusesabagina, a Hutu who worked at four star hotel in Kigali. When the war broke out he thought of only saving his immediate family but as he saw what was happening he opened the hotel to Tutsi and Hutus seeking refuge from the killing. He used all the favours he had stored as manager of the hotel and basically saved over a thousand lives. This will be the next Schindler's list. When the film was over, there was a standing ovation. Don Cheadle was excellent as an ordinary man forced to do extra-ordinary things. Paul Rusesabagina and his family attended the screening and he received a five minute standing ovation. Even Michael Moore came to see this movie. I highly recommend it. 9/10."
"Just saw the San Francisco premier last night and it isn't a dramatization - it's much more of a documentary -- Hotel is extremely factual. CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THIS FILM! INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE! The Director and the story's protagonist were at the screening to answer questions. We ovated him for almost 10 minutes. Near the end of the q&a, an older man stood up and was called on. Slowly he commented that as a Tutsi, the movie gave him a lot to think about and that it may now be possible to find peace in his heart. The audience was stunned. And believe me, it takes a lot to silence a San Francisco audience. One last comment, the film is indpendently made and distributed - no Hollywood involvement at all (Terry George is British). There will be no machine pumping out ads and radio anouncements about this one. Help get the word out - great film!"
"At one point in ""Hotel Rwanda,"" our hero Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) asks an American TV reporter (Joaquin Phoenix) how the western world could not intervene after seeing scenes of women and children being hacked by machete-wielding Hutu militia.How could they not, indeed! As we all know, the west didn't intervene. Not surprising, really. After all, this was Africa and Rwanda had no oil reserves. The people being killed were innocent men, women and children, but they were poor and black.A few years ago, former President Bill Clinton apologized to Rwandans for not intervening during the 100-day massacre that saw about one million Tutsis and moderate Hutus slaughtered in the most barbaric manner. It was gracious of Clinton, but a fat lot of good his apology did to the people who were killed and their families.The Rwandan genocide - that's what it was, though western leaders split hairs over the meaning of genocide  also was a black mark on western nations, which simply got their citizens out of Rwanda and then remained indifferent to the senseless killings.Terry George's film gives us one story about the Rwandan genocide, of one hero, Paul, a savvy, clever and cunning manager of a swank, four-star Belgian hotel in the capital, Kigali. When the massacres began, Paul, a Hutu, sheltered more than 1,200 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in the hotel and saved them from the wrath of the bloodthirsty mobs.Working from a smart script by Keir Pearson and George, ""Hotel Rwanda"" contains gutwrenching and emotionally trying moments not seen on the big screen since ""Schindler's List"" (1993). But whereas Spielberg's masterpiece was more arty and artistic - and I don't mean that pejoratively - George's film seems more immediate. Maybe it's because we now see a similar slaughter of poor, downtrodden people in the Darfur region of Sudan and, again, western nations aren't doing much other than threatening to rap the knuckles of the bad guys like angry teachers. This crisis gives ""Hotel Rwanda"" a sense of urgency.As visceral as this film is at times, George handles everything in muted fashion. We never see the horrors firsthand. There's brief news footage of people being killed and one particularly searing scene when Paul and his bellhop Gregoire (Tony Kgoroge) find themselves on a bumpy road. The moment's made more horrifying because George unveils it quite matter-of-factly.Making a PG-13 film about genocide requires numerous compromises. Putting most, if not all, of the violence off-camera is one such bargain George made. True, a closer look at the massacre would have rightly tortured us. But the film, nevertheless, works without gruesome moments. Pearson and George set out to make a story of heroism, survival, love and compassion amid the madness. And they succeeded.Cheadle carries the entire film. There isn't a false note in his performance. For years, he's turned in one superb performance after another. He's one of those actors who never hits it wrong and whose performances always stand out even if the films themselves aren't all that memorable. Here, he's in equal measure the smooth manager, man with a conscience and frightened husband and father. You can sense Paul's frustration, though Cheadle rarely displays any vulnerability.He gets great support from Sophie Okonedo as Paul's Tutsi wife, Tatiana, and Nick Nolte doing his best work in years as a Canadian United Nations officer, Colonel Oliver. Okonedo and Cheadle are utterly believable as a couple. They have one traumatic scene on the hotel roof, a quietly powerful moment that tugs at our heartstrings as we watch two people who love each other try to deal with what could happen. Okonedo conveys anger, fear and pain without ever turning the moment sentimental or needlessly overwrought. That's why the moment's shattering.""Hotel Rwanda"" isn't flawless. George doesn't harshly indict the west for its indifference. Also, some scenes, especially one near the film's end, seem staged for obvious dramatic effect, to play with our sense of sympathy and dread. But minor faults can easily be forgiven because the rest of the film works so well, never sensationalizing any moment. The film's straightforward approach gives it more power, makes it more trenchant and meaningful.I would like to believe that we learn from history and the more powerful western nations will always come to the aid of oppressed people everywhere. But we're doing little in Darfur and although President George W. Bush openly touts his vision to spread liberty and democracy to oppressed peoples everywhere, I doubt he actually means it. After all, this freedom doctrine was something he created only after his initial justification for waging an unjust war - Iraq's supposed stockpiles of WMD - proved to be wholly without merit or fact. I doubt he actually considers bringing liberty to places like Zimbabwe or Burma. He speaks of the need for people to be free, conveniently ignoring some dictatorial nations - Pakistan and Turkmenistan, for instance - because they happen to be our allies. And so the dumb foreign policy continues.I can only hope the success of ""Hotel Rwanda"" will prompt other gutsy screenwriters and filmmakers to tell us more stories about the horrors that took place and the complacency of industrialized nations that could have helped and chose not to."
"I have just seen this film and have to say I am deeply moved by it. The premise of the film is about one mans struggle to do the right thing at when everything around him is going wrong. Don Cheadle is the best African American actor out there. His passion and heart was so strong that moved me almost to tears. There is a definite wish here to let this story to be known to the world. Its powerful and provocative in its indirect and subtle jabs at the west for not intervening into such a horror that took place in Rwanda.Very well made and directed. Please see this and let it inspire you as it did me - to try cultivate selfless actions. Thanks, Ricky Thind"
"1994 Rwanda,Kigali. Paul Rusesabagina(Don Cheadle)is a Hutu happily married(Sophie Okonedo) and with children.He's Hotel manager Millie Collines proprietary of Belgian Airlines:Sabena and its General Director(Jean Reno) placed in Belgium.Paul is respected for his generosity,charm,friendship and numerous contacts with important people.He's accidentally trapped in violent events when his family and neighbours are threaten to kill.He gets avoid it by means of bribes with the hope that United Nations(UN) and international forces arrive to preventing the civil war. However the happenings break out again.After assassination of President of Rwanda, all get worse.It begins the horrible genocide including rampage,ravishing and ravage in Rwanda which is spread for Burundi.Slaughter of Tusis by the Hutu is executed by soldiers and rebels. A journalist(Joaquin Phoenix)get into tumult and will shoot to show it at the world.Paul gets to protect his family and unfortunates refugees at the hotel but others hapless by the hundred are coming to ask help.Meanwhile the refugees Tutsis flee toward Congo to find shelter.The film has an acid critic to the indolence of United Nations(exception Colonel incarnated by Nick Nolte) and international community and specially, the abandon of foreign policy European.Thus, a personage says that origin conflict is for Belgians whom in colonization epoch differentiated the Tutsi as highest and complexion more white and co-governed united the country,now the Hutu are taking the vengeance. It's calculated that in the indiscriminate massacre were cruelly killed by militia Interhamwe approximately one million people and in only three month.Conflict finished in 1994 when the Tutsi throw out the Hutu army and militia through of the frontier Congo. Leader of Interhamwe was condemned to maxim penalty. Don Cheadle interpretation is magnificent ,he was nominated for Acadamy Award although wrongly didn't obtain it.The motion picture is well directed by Terry George. Rating : Awesome and above average .Indispensable watching"
"I'm a college freshman at a small school in New York taking a class on the individuals role and responsibility in community. We read the book ""We'd like to inform you that tomorrow we will be killed with our families"" about the Rwandan genocide and then went to see this movie. It is very accurate about what happened but reading it is just not the same as seeing it, it seemed horrendous always but when I actually saw the movie it was just... Jesus... it's so hard to believe that this happened and that this could. The film was excellent in both execution and portrayal. Everyone must see this movie and know we are all human beings and it is our responsibility to be there for each other. Jesus Christ... this can not happen."
"I attended the United States premier of Hotel Rwanda on November 3rd, 2004 in Philadelphia. I have never written a review for a movie before, but this movie was excellent and I am urging everyone I know that they should see it as well. I lived in Rwanda in the summer of '04. I have read several books on the history of Rwanda and talked about the '94 genocide with locals in Rwanda and also with Rwandans living in the US. I am by no means an expert on the history or the country, but I do know a fair amount about it, which is part of why I am writing this review. The movie was an excellent reproduction of what Rwanda is like and it tells the true story of one of the many heroes during that time. While it is a sad movie, it is also a story of hope. The portrayal of the violence was subtle and powerful, but not overly graphic. The movie focuses on the efforts of the manager of an upscale hotel in Kigali, the capital of Rwanda to protect the guests/refugees streaming into his hotel to escape the killing. The writer/directory (who spoke after the premier) said that he made an effort to get a PG13 rating rather than an R rating to ensure that students would be able to see this movie. It is an important movie to see because it brings to life the hope and triumph in Rwanda. It also shows what the media did not show in '94 and is not showing in Darfur: The suffering of ordinary people who need help from the rest of the world. While governments repeat the phrase 'never again' yet do nothing, it is up to us to ordinary people to learn about these events and do something or make our governments do something about them. Please see this movie-it does not have the budget to launch everywhere and relies on word of mouth to generate enough interest to make it into every city."
"In 1994 tensions are high in Rwanda between the ruling Hutus and the Tutsis rebels while the UN tries to broken a peace agreement. This is of little interest to Paul Rusesabagina, a Hutu with a Tutsis wife whose position within a leading hotel means he has to curry favour with many officials and smoothing over any potential problems at every turn. When the Hutu president is assassinated, a massacre of Tutsis begin  adults and children alike. With the UN unable to take action due to the indifference of the West the murders continue and Paul finds himself with a hotel, evacuated of important whites but full of Tutsis refugees as the Hutus seek to finish the job they started.I'm not entirely sure how one can review this film with a clear mind because no matter how good or bad a film it is, it is near impossible not to left shaken by the events it depicts. The plot follows the story of Paul Rusesabagina, who pulled all the strings he could to protect the Tutsis refugees who wound up in his hotel during the genocide by the Hutus. In this regard we are given a way into the atrocities through this specific story and this is both a strength and a weakness in the telling. The strength is that it gives us a focal point and a point of emotional connection that we can relate to and see a human face in the way that the terrifying numbers do not. However the downside of this is that it makes the story smaller than it could have been and puts the scale of atrocities outside of our direct view for the majority. It also means that it produces a ""happy"" ending that leaves you with a sense of some respite (not to mention the obligatory ""African"" song). This was a problem for me because the film had succeeded in gutting me at points and I didn't want to be left with any upbeat note  I wanted to go away feeling just like the foreign photographer did; ""f**king ashamed"".However considering what the film does well, it is petty and unfair to make a bit issue out of the fact that the narrative is occasionally a bit clunky and perhaps that the depiction of the genocide doesn't go far enough. Even without graphic violence and more than one scene of actual horror the film still sickened me to my stomach, had me almost shaking with anger and fear while at the same time failing to prevent tears rolling. Like many viewers I knew little more than a genocide occurred and couldn't have told you which side was killing the other  this is not ignorance on my behalf but just the fact that the West ignored this and stood by while it occurred while the media gave it little or no coverage. The film depicts this very well giving us enough horror and enough human emotion mixed with an understanding of the West's attitude to produce an impression of an event that is indefensible and truly, truly horrific. The characters are quite broadly painted but they do enough to give us an understanding of what occurred. While I do feel that the film could have shown more and been wider, the close focus on the hotel and the Rusesabagina's means that we are never far from understanding the true extent of horror and just how much of a reality death is  Paul does not discuss how his family will survive if the hotel is stormed, only how they will die in the least horrific way.Matching the tone of the film are two performances that blow away everyone they were nominated with at the 2005 Oscars. Cheadle's accent in Ocean's 11 was the worst cockney this side of Mary Poppins but here he gets the accent and mannerisms just right and made me forget that he was an American. His character changes throughout the film and he copes with it really well, producing a character that is easy to get behind and provides a very human face to the story. Okonedo is superb and is almost impossible to watch without being moved to tears more than once. Nolte is effectively gruff although he is less a character than he is a symbol of how ineffective the UN was at the time. In a similar vein Phoenix is excellent in a small role although really I could have done with a few less starry cameos as they tended to distract from the main material. Outside of the lead two, the actors are not given as much to work with as the lead two but Cheadle and Okonedo are superb and match the emotional impact of the material.Overall this is not a perfect film; it didn't quite go far enough and the focus on a small group tended to conceal the scale of the genocide. However this is a minor complaint because the film is devastatingly effective and is impossible to watch without feeling lost, helpless and utterly ashamed for our inaction. This is not an easy watch and will not be a fun night out for the audience but for many reasons it deserves as large an audience as possible."
"The madness one sees in this brilliant film is hard to imagine, yet it occurred in Rwanda. Terry George, the director, captures those terrible days in Rwanda in his film ""Hotel Rwanda"". Mr. George has to be commended for bringing to the screen a detailed account of a country in chaos. Working with Keir Pearson on the screen play, the director presents us with the horrors of what the country lived during the holocaust that befell Rwanda.At the center of the story is Paul Rusesabagina, a courageous man who witnessed first hand the worst days of the Hutu rebellion and its bloody aftermath. This man alone was able to protect and to save more than a thousand Rwandans that clearly would not be around today, had it not been for his tremendous stand against people that showed no mercy, or wouldn't reason about what they were doing to their fellow citizens.The performance of Don Cheadle, as Paul Rusesabagina, is worth the price of admission! This wonderful actor projects such an intelligence that it's hard to find in any American film released in 2004. Mr. Cheadle was right to portray this man; it was a role he was born to play. Mr. Cheadle got under the skin of the hotel manager and runs away with the film. It's hard to keep ones eyes from this commanding performance.The rest of the mostly black cast is excellent. One must single out Sophie Okoneko, who plays Paul's wife with such dignity that she perfectly matches Mr. Cheadle's performance. Nick Nolte is fine as the UN Colonel trying to keep peace in a place gone mad.Congratulations to Mr. George. With this film he touches us in more ways than we imagined. The unfortunate tragedy could well have been avoided if the international community would have intervened sooner, but obviously, it didn't even try until it was too late."
"The basic hurdle for the world to have more empathy with the macro issue of the horrendous massacre is the fact that the world is uninformed. Unlike the situation of Nazis and Jews, Irish Catholics and British Protestants or Crusade and Islam, the issue of Tutsi and Hutu in Rwanda has not generally been heard of by an average citizen of the world. In the movie, the reporter asks two women at the bar in Hotel Rwanda what tribe they belong to. ""Hutu"" says one, and ""Tutsi"", the other. The reported turns around and comments to his companion ""They look like twins to me"". That says a lot.The film does educate us on the brief background of the local history, on how the Belgians used the Tutsi's to rule the Hutu and so since they left, the Hutu had been waiting for their chance to revenge. That is however just the bare backbone of the history, but we have not been brought to a deeper understanding of the bitter hatred that drove the Hutus to a diabolical genocide of a million Tutsi in 1994 as the world turned its back: ""the nations are united in their indifference towards Rwanda"" as Mr. Ebert aptly puts it.Rather than being an epic on macro scale, Hotel Rwanda is a personal story (albeit a true one) on micro scale, about hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina's heroic efforts which saved twelve hundred hotel ""guests"" of Tutsi descent, including his own wife. This is a story told with high quality filming and yet one cannot help but come away feeling that it leans slightly towards looking like a Hollywood thriller. It would be gross injustice to say it's crafted and yet, the climax after climax of narrow escape and cliffhanging suspense does feel a tad Hollywood. It would be gross injustice to say that it's a tearjerker and yet one cannot help feeling traces of familiarity in the Hollywood style emotional pull. And there is considerable predictability, such as the sudden bumpy ride of the jeep in the fog would be easily discerned by a regular moviegoer as the signal for the next scene: a road strewn with bodies of massacred victims.Oscar nominee Don Cheadle's performance as the circumstance-driven hero is deservedly recognized by the nomination. Nick Notle, who was wonderful in ""Clean"", puts in another great performance here as a similarly circumstance-driven hero in the U.N. peace keeping force Col. Oliver. The rest of the cast contributing to making this film a solid success includes Sophie Okonedo who was nominated for Best Supporting Actress as Pauls's wife Tatiana and Joaquin Phoenix as the reporter whose videotape of the massacre made the world pay attention. All told, Hotel Rwanda is a high-quality movie, but I can't agree with many comments hailing Hotel Rwanda as another Schindler's List."
"As one can probably imagine, a film with an 8,5 out of 10 (with 4.356 votes) ranking at number 130 of the IMDb's top 250 has few naysayers. There are some there however and I've taken the trouble to read them. What I think is sort of funny, is that many of the critique that is placed is utterly stupid. One person actually goes so far as to say that the film: ""doesn't manage to escape the formulaic Hollywood feel-good story of the hero who wins out in the end. This typical treatment may be fine for other topics, but Rwanda was a real genocide, and this tragedy should not be treated as the playground of 'based on a true story' movies."" This is I feel a very feeble critique. This is not a film about the Rwandan genocide as is was, but a film about the events Paul Rusesabagina witnessed. He cannot help the fact that he didn't get to see much of the genocide and that he and his family survived in the end. Or maybe flat6 (the writer) thinks they should have just killed Rusesabagina off in the film, which certainly would have been more dramatic, but much less true. Also, doesn't this criticism mean that Schindler's List is a bad film as well? Another writer, imdb-45 states that: ""The film gives no treatment as to the reason for the hatred between the two sects of African black people and concentrates virtually on a man's heroic attempt to save people in a hotel, many of which are would-be victims of the genocide."" If I'm not mistaken, the reason for the hatred is actually clearly outline in a conversation between Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), Jack (Joaquin Phoenix) and a local African journalist. I mean I am no expert on the subject, but it seemed pretty clear to me (if that was the whole of it). Basically it was just like WW 2, based on race, an African holocaust so to speak (although less organized and without the concentration camps as far as I know).The same author states that: ""there is an awkward product plug for Volkswagon that ruins a genuinely amusing moment. There are product plugs for several different alcohol beverages that don't quite feel right."" Well, sorry but in reality people use product and brand names on a daily basis. So why not in a film? Because than it is advertising? If you recommend a brand of beer to your friends it is also advertising in a way, although on a much smaller scale.Someone else, fooltank77, states that the film doesn't say what happened after the genocide. While that is true, it isn't a flaw. This is the story of Paul Rusesabagina and his family and what happened tot hem during the genocide. The rest is nothing of the films concern. Also, everybody who watches the news occasionally or reads the paper knows that it is far from peaceful down there even now. Do you need to have everything presented to you? Personally I felt that this was a very impressing and good film. The performances and the directing were great and despite the fact that the film didn't show much of the slaughter, it was emotionally unsettling enough. I was especially astounded by the fact that the UN did so little to help. I knew that there wasn't much interference, but the fact that there was virtually no help at all just goes to show that Africa is just too far away for the rich and distant countries to worry. I daresay that the events in the film made me almost ashamed to be living in one of those rich UN countries.I feel that if you actually go to see this film and expect it to be an individual tale within a massive cultural slaughter, you will come to accept that this film has it's boundaries and doesn't show everything that happened before , during or after the genocide. Demanding that and claiming the film is bad because it doesn't give you everything there is, would be like saying Schindler's list is bad, because it didn't show the political situation in Germany in the beginning of the 1930's, how Hitler gained his power, what happened in Stalingrad, what Dr.Mengele did during medical experiments on Jews or the killing of the moffen-hoeren (women who had sex with Germans during WW 2) in the Netherlands after the war. My point here is that a film like Schindler's list doesn't actually have as much background info as is demanded of this film by some viewers. It is just that we (in the western world) now much more about WW 2 than we do of a distant African genocide. Also there is so much suffering when something like this occurs and one film can not show it all. All it can do is show us parts of the tragedy and maybe inspire viewers to try and find out more about it. Giving a complete picture of such a tragedy is like completing a puzzle. Bear in mind that this is only the first piecehopefully.8 out of 10"
"This is a terrific movie. The performances are spectacular, particularly Don Cheadle. He deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of the hotel manager. The movie itself is much more important than just entertainment value. Most people aren't familiar with the horrific events in Rwanda in the 1990's, but they should be. We tend to think that genocide is something from the past that just doesn't happen in today's ""civil"" modern world. The true story behind this movie proves just the opposite. With all the focus on the Holocaust in World War II and all the talk about ""never letting it happen again,"" the world as a whole failed the people of Rwanda miserably just a few years ago. Everyone should see this movie, and learn a thing or two."
"Hotel Rwanda (2004) Directed by Terry George, is the great film of 2004.Don Cheadle plays Paul Rusesabagina, an African who has bought into the European ideal of the perfect life. He's the manager of a four-star hotel in Rwanda. He has a beautiful wife (played by Sophie Okonedo), handsome and healthy young children, a new vehicle, and a fine suburban home.All this changes when civil strife erupts in Rwanda. When this happens the former colonial powers wash their hands of the problems, and the Rwandans are left to fend for themselves in an atmosphere of increasing violence and anarchy.The acting is excellent and the story is emotionally gripping. Like Schindler's List, the film follows one man's attempt to save as many people as he can. Schindler and Rusesabagina were heroic, resourceful, and amazingly effective. However, as individuals, they could accomplish only so much. Outside intervention could have saved a million lives in Rwanda, but it was never forthcoming. The Rwandan genocide is one of the great tragedies of the 20th century. Hotel Rwanda brings this horror onto the screen and into our lives.Addendum: Nick Nolte plays Colonel Oliver, the U.N. commander in Rwanda. This role is obviously based on Lieutenant General Romeo Dallaire, the Canadian officer who commanded the ridiculously small force of 400 U.N. soldiers. These troops were unable to do anything more than watch the genocide taking place before their eyes. General Dellaire's story is told in Steven Silver's film ""The Last Just Man."""
"''Hotel Rwanda'''is a very powerful and sad story showing the atrocities that happened in Rwanda in 1994,where almost 1 million people were killed in 100 days. The division of two groups, the tutsis and the hutus,made Rwanda's peace something to dream about. We see that all started when the Belgians gave power to the tustsis, because they had a fair skin and a complexion much more similar of the Europeans then the hutus. Even measuring the noses was a normal thing to do. Years after, the Hutus were the ones who stayed with the power and they wanted revenge by smashing the tutsis.This movie shows the history of a man called Paul Rusesabagina and his courage during the war in Rwanda, when he saved the lives of over a thousand helpless tutsi refugees from a big genocide. Paul is a hutu, but his family is tutsi, another reason to have experienced the terrible things the hutus were doing to the tutsis.Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo are both awesome in their roles, and Don should have won the best actor award/Nobel.Ps: Jean Reno's cameo here."
"This is a 'negative review', and I'm having a hard time explaining why I'm dissatisfied with this movie. I'll do my best. First off, it is a noble effort  the fact that this movie covers this topic of the Rwandan genocide, attempting to bring it a wide audience, is something to be commended. In the contemporary clutter of brainless, feel-good movies, anything that tries to be somewhat responsible and serious is to be commended for effort alone. But dealing with a topic of this magnitude is a double edged sword: the movie has a responsibility to making the viewer feel 1 million dead.Unfortunately, it doesn't manage to escape the formulaic Hollywood feel-good story of the hero who wins out in the end. This typical treatment may be fine for other topics, but Rwanda was a real genocide, and this tragedy should not be treated as the playground of 'based on a true story' movies. When there are 1 million people being butchered, I don't want to see the main character hugging his wife, telling the audience how much his family means to him. I don't want to see the obviously sanitized gruesomeness that won't revolt the typical movie-goer. And please, I don't want to see the many, many cheap and improbable just-in-time rescues. Not here. That's too easy.I can see that in every other popcorn flick concerning concocted disasters befalling some typical hero. (This type of treatment has been cheapened by its predecessors, and it no longer genuinely reaches the audience - or at least this member of the audience.) Something truly original was needed here, a delicate mix between the irrationality and inhumanity of the conflict. Instead, it let just a little bit of Hollywood formula creep in, and for Rwanda, that is unacceptable. Despite its excellent attempt, the movie fails. Perhaps not surprisingly. This movie sets a huge expectation for itself by dealing with such a gruesome, REAL event. How do you condense into 2 hours something that no one can even begin to grasp, understand, explain? But the difficulty of its task still doesn't rescue this movie, because effort marks can only go so far. Even the slightest bit of over dramatization and the show cheapens  the lovely tale of the hotel manager falls apart, and the figure of 1 million dead reappears. It turns Hotel Rwanda from an attempt to make one understand and appreciate this bit of history into a gimmicky, easy-to-swallow portrayal of the genocide of 1 million people. Hotel Rwanda isn't gimmicky, nor easy-to-swallow, by any USUAL set of standards, but just dealing with the Rwandan genocide raises the standard to an impossible level. Not surprisingly, the movie can't reach those impossible standards; I don't know that anything this side of an excellent documentary can."
"I heard this movie was good but that really isn't true. It is a masterpiece! I have never been so moved by a movie. This movie is just so sad and moving. I can't even imagine what the real thing must have been like. Please see this movie. I think it is important for the world to know what happened and to remember what happened to the Tootsie people. I really hope this movie wins an Acadamy Award all in the movie were amazing and did an amazing job portraying the seemingly hopeless situation they were in. The part that bothers me is how no one tried to help. I'd like to believe we didn't know but that's not true. What Jaquin Phonix's character said is true ""They'll say 'that's terrible' and then they'll go back to eating their dinner."" and it'also true what the UN officer said. People just didn't care enough. I hope this film teaches us that people of all races and countries are important."
"A decade ago, the country of Rwanda underwent a costly civil war which claimed countless lives while a whole world stood by. In the true story of Hotel Rwanda, one ordinary man took it upon himself to save as many people as he could even risking his own life and the lives of his family.This hotel is a luxurious venue for travelers (mostly white) to spend a pleasant trip while attended to by the staff and its manager, Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle). Ominous signs in the news and rumors point to growing hostilities between two ethnic groups, the minority and former ruling group of Tutsis and the majority group of Hutus. A militaristic movement among the Hutus begins to form even as an impending peace treaty is brokered. When one leader is assassinated, all hell breaks loose. This is civil war at its worst as the Hutus begins to attack and kill the Tutsis en masse. It is the beginning of a genocide that will claim close to a million lives as the United Nations does relatively little to intervene.As the white guests are escorted to safety by United Nations troops, things grow desperate for those left behind. Paul starts to shelter a few people including his own family and then more refugees until over 1200 fearful souls seek safety in the hotel. In some instances, it is out of necessity that he take in people who have nowhere to go. Pretty soon he realizes that he must do all he can to save his people and himself. This means calling on favors and relationships with any and all who can help, and frequently it means the difference between life and death. There are numerous occasions where the military is ready to take the refugees away or execute them and Paul on the spot. There is stark evidence of the increasing atrocities as homes are burned and bodies litter the roads. Bribes and supplies begin to run short, and as the outnumbered UN forces return to escort only a limited number to safety, the rebels begin to descend on them and the hotel.As a shameful, cautionary tale of what happened when the world ignored its most needy, Hotel Rwanda serves its purpose, but the main thrust of the story is the love Paul has for his wife and children and the determination to save them. The important thing is how he responds to the horrific events and how he must think his way out of seemingly impossible situations. It is truly remarkable how resourceful the real Paul Rusesabagina was in staving off doom.As portrayed by Don Cheadle, we understand his thought processes and feel his pain. He never loses his humanity and compassion for his fellow man. It is a splendid job of acting. Ironically, Cheadle (who was not considered box office leading material by the studios) has leaped into the forefront of leading men for good after having spent most of his career in strong supporting parts (Bulworth, Oceans 11, Out of Sight). Sophie Okonedo is quite good as the wife who must fight for her family and support her beleaguered husband. Nick Nolte plays a recurring part as a UN officer whose units of soldiers are virtually powerless to help. Joaquin Phoenix has a small role as a news cameraman witnessing the beginning slaughter and Jean Reno has a good cameo as a hotel executive in France who proves to be a valuable ally.Although, there was initial difficulty in securing financing for this project, director Terry George (who also wrote the screenplay with Keir Pearson) does not seem to have skimped on his visuals. The massive crowd scenes and evidence of mass execution are thorough and impressive. It is as if we are living a real life documentary about war. He does a nice job of contrasting the chaos in the countryside with the peaceful, relative calm inside the hotel. He also manages to balance the tension and terror with a few effective moments of honest humor especially with Paul's family-quite a feat.While there are obvious similarities in theme to Schindler's List, Hotel Rwanda's protagonist is not only the benefactor, but he becomes a potential victim, thus raising the stakes. Even with a PG-13 rating compared to Schindler's R rating, this is no less compelling history and the events no less despicable. George does not have the directorial flourishes of Spielberg, but his film succeeds on an emotional level.Although the subject matter may cause potential audiences to pause, those who want an intelligent, honest depiction of one man's remarkable acts of heroism amid an unthinkable tragedy will not be disappointed. It is a courageous film that teaches the audience about individual responsibility and choice. It is about one man making a difference for over a thousand of his countrymen amid the horror and chaos even as the world turned its back.**** out of **** (every bit as good as the five Oscar nominated Best Pictures of 2004)"
"I usually say my criteria for assessing a film are asking myself if it inspired, educated or entertained me. I somehow don't seem to have a category for 'it totally devastated me'.Nearly all the main characters are based on real life people  very real. One of the problems we have in coming to terms with the ethnic destruction of a peoples we have no knowledge of, have little culturally in common with, have little to identify them as 'people' other than a biological acknowledgement is that, for us, they are not very 'real'. So is the point of a film about the Rwandan genocide that left a million dead that they become more real? Does that make any difference? One of the results of going to see this very powerful, very harrowing (and in terms of the personal integrity and bravery of some central characters, very beautiful) film is that part of the proceeds go towards helping the people who are left. Another, perhaps, is that by becoming more aware of suffering our desire to find a way to avoid or alleviate it increases. The film shows a divide between - on one hand - the Rwandan people who, rich or poor, had sensibilities much like you or I, - and on the other hand - the troglodytes that wanted to kill each other and (with a logic reminiscent of President Bush's ""if you're not with us you're against us"" simplistic attitude) anyone who didn't join them. The inclusiveness of the carnage and the inability (or unwillingness) of the West to help meant there was no get out along the lines of 'if they want to kill each other let them'.The performances are so spellbinding that it is hard to watch the film without feeling the suffering of those involved. Although it points the finger at a reluctance of the West to get involved, we also have to ask ourselves that, even if the powerful governments or the UN were willing to get involved, could the carnage have been prevented? The lack of any well-structured hint at a potential solution is perhaps one of the (very few) flaws of the film. Similarly, the swiftness of some of the events makes historic sense but there is not always enough detail to explain why things happened the way they did. But it seems clear that some intervention could have at least reduced a large amount of the carnage, so in a way Hotel Rwanda is a protest against international apathy.The official website of the movie provides much in the way of reference material, links and analysis. This helped to confirm my view while watching the film that those involved felt that there was something more at stake than being film stars. In doing so they have become true stars, irrespective of what awards were won or not."
"This is a good movie. That can't be denied. But it is also the polished PG-13 version of one of the most horrifying events in modern history. Every little bit of information about the Rwandan genocide, that can find its way to the knowledge of people, is of course precious, and for that I am happy that this movie was made and brought lights to the topic in a way that regrettably not even the actual genocide could do. BUT... (And this is a big BUT.) This movie, has IMO never been able to fully depict the absolute horror of the genocide in Rwanda. It is not about the amounts of blood on the screen, nor the number of bodies in piles in the frames. It's about how you close up to the subject. And nothing in this movie makes me relive the anguish and emotional trauma which I felt when I was in Rwanda, some 8 yrs after the genocide. I have seen the scarred remains of a country trying to build itself up from the ashes. I've seen the mass graves, the Gacaca courts, the thousands and yet thousands of convicted perpetrators in their pink uniforms, working the fields. I have been to the survivors center and I have seen the thousands of skulls lying in N'tarama Church. What does ""Hotel Rwanda"" make me feel? Not very much. (As a note - I have also been to ""Mille Collines"". Which was a rather bizarre feeling, that luxury in the midst of poor Kigali.) This movie is just a little bit too detached from the reality as it was, to get to you in the way that the story of the genocide really does, if told in another way. Sure, I can see that people who have not known much about the Rwandan genocide, can get very emotionally affected by the movie, and I do too, of course. But, I still think that this movie makes a quite a shallow impression compared with other movies on the topic. Of course, I wasn't there when it actually happened, but when you have seen the mayhem after it with your own eyes, it's still different to when you haven't. AND ALSO - the thing that bugs me the most is the fact that Paul Rusesabagina really isn't quite the hero the world seems to think him to be. Did you know that the man ""sold"" shelter to the refugees coming to Mille Collines? The ones with money got in, the ones without, didn't. So the people who survived thanks to Rusesabagina were mainly very rich. Of course it's good that they survived, but what about the ones with no money. Rusesabagina did good, yes. But is he a hero? No. The heroes were the families who hid their neighbors, the UN-soldiers who desperately tried to get word out to the the rest of the world and get military task forces in, but were ignored and left to see the slaughter with tied hands. The people who risked their own lives to try to save others. The soldiers of the RPF, who were the ones who stopped this madness. Never believe everything you see in a movie without trying to get the full picture. No... if you are interested in this horrific but engaging chapter of modern history, and wish to know more about the shameful way in which the UN and the rest of the world handled the whole thing, I strongly recommend you to watch some other stuff. Like the best movie made about the Rwandan genocide: ""Shooting dogs"", which is much more likely to get you to understand the event in a more broad way, as well as give a much more deep emotional experience. ""Shake hands with the devil"" is a very well made TV-production about one of the true heroes from Rwanda 1994 - Roméo Dallaire. (On which Nolte's character in ""Hotel Rwanda"" was loosely based). There is also a very good documentary with the same name - ""Shake hands with the devil - the journey of Roméo Dallaire"". Also, there are some other movies on the topic - of which ""Sometimes in April"" is the best. I recently saw ""Kinyarwanda"", which was very good from some aspects."
"Sentimental dramas are not my thing, but after the good reviews that Hotel Rwanda has been winning itself; I figured it has to be worth a go, and it was; but that's all it's worth. For a film that's supposed to 'stay with you' and 'leave an impact'; Hotel Rwanda is a huge disappointment. There isn't much in this film that wouldn't be able to be took from a documentary on the subject of the plight of Rwanda; but it has to be said, in spite of this, that Hotel Rwanda balances it's story with the human drama rather well, as not too much time is ever spent on either. The film can easily be likened to a disaster movie, as it gives two sides of a story - one being a terrible happening and the other being the effect on the people involved. This likeness continues when you come to realise that the protagonists are totally uninvolving characters and the only reason that the film gives you for feeling for them is the fact that they're the leads. Hotel Rwanda will get praise from some people because it's based on a true story, but this film fan isn't as easily impressed as many evidently are.The film is very well put together, with the acting, direction and production values all being very classy examples of how good each can be. The story takes in themes of the futility of war, love for your fellow man and, of course, the race divide (another reason for the good critical reaction), and it has to be said that all of these things are done well, and even quite potent at times. The film is also notable for avoiding many of the pitfalls that befall most dramas of this nature - things such as over the top sentiment or long, heartfelt speeches. While the film definitely has an underbelly of sentiment, it never sees fit to fully expose it; and that is always a good thing in my opinion. The film is keen to give glimpses of it at it at times, however, and these moments tend to be cringe-worthy. The ending is a prime example of that; and despite the fact that this is based on a true story and that's simply 'how it ends'; the film could have handled it better, and then I wouldn't have left the cinema feeling like I'd just been slapped in the face after spending two hours of my time on the film.On the whole, Hotel Rwanda is a long shot away from being a 'bad' film; but it's not a great film either, and the lack of sympathy for the characters will make some people feel like they should have watched a straight documentary instead. Many have, and will continue to be seduced by the racism theme and the fact that it's based on a true story; but not me, and hopefully not you either, as there's more to a great film than just that."
The movie was brilliant I had to see it for history class and I learned a lot. I wanted to see the movie Don Chedle is brilliant and is great at this particular role. His wife was great as well. This is a Must see movie. It will take you back to when Rwanda was in trouble and no one came to help except one guy who sheltered 1000 Tutsis and is a hero of Rwanda. It was sad though because it was a war and a lot of people died. Very educational and a good lesson to learn about peace and war. The movie was so great but very sad I cried and I am writing an essay on the movie. I also want to see it again. It was so good and there is a lesson to be learned about helping and keeping peace between people. I felt very sorry for the people of Rwanda who lost family members.
"This movie is so brilliant and powerful. I think this movie will make viewers want to do something and take action where it is needed, locally or globally. It makes the viewers question, ""Where were we about eleven years ago (I was about five or six years old) and why didn't we help?"" and ""How can people be so cruel?"" I can believe people are that cruel but at the same time I can't believe it. It is very touching and very moving and hopefully it will open eyes to the trouble around the world. The message of this movie needed to be delivered to America and this movie delivers it excellently. This movie deserves to win ""Best Picture"" of the year. This movie will make you think. I don't think anyone could walk away from this movie unchanged."
"HOTEL RWANDA (2004) **** Don Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo, Nick Nolte, Joaquin Phoenix. (Dir: Terry George)""Schindler's List"" meets ""The Killing Fields"" by way of ""Casablanca"" ; Cheadle's triumphant career bestWhat would you do if suddenly you found yourself in the oncoming path of a genocide? That is the question that South African Paul Rusesabagina faced ten years ago when the Hutu militia hunted down its Tutsi citizens determined to wipe out these 'cockroaches'.Rusesabagina (played beautifully by Cheadle who deserves an Oscar nomination) is a mild-mannered yet savvy businessman who works as a hotel manager in Rwanda in 1994 who has put on blinders to the unrest in his nation that suddenly sets its all-too-true reality in his neighborhood one night when he witnesses one of his neighbors being dragged bodily from his home by a jeep of Army soldiers and then beaten when he resists. Life as he knows it is now over as this is the tip of iceberg to what events lay in wait.Determined to save his small neighborhood and his family l Rusesabagina maneuvers one of the hotel's van shuttles crammed with his friends and family to the Hotel Demille where he works as a refugee site. Shortly thereafter the hotel is inundated with scores of fleeing Tutsis seeking solace and Paul must then decide what can be done to keep the bloodshed at bay. On hand is the UN soldiers led by Canadian Col. Oliver (a world-weary Nolte doing some fine supporting work) who informs Paul that things are only getting worse for the most part and as predicted the black South Africans will not be rescued leaving the ingenuity and quick thinking of Paul to keep things on track until they manage a form of escape.Director Terry George racks up the suspense and dread without resorting to any truly graphic images of the war at hand and the uprisings depict the machete brandishing hordes at a safe distance yet there is no doubt of just how horrific the proceedings at hand are in some truly unnerving moments including Paul's decision to get supplies in the dead of night when he encounters what he fears the most  that things in fact are only worse than he could have ever imagined.Cheadle, one of our finest and most versatile actors working today, gives his portrayal of a decent, ordinary and extraordinary man that many of us would only aspire to be in the face of death and the threat of violence so thick in the air it would more than likely only cause paralysis to contemplate a next move in a morbid game of chess  a dignity that encompasses the entire film and spread to his co-stars, namely the stoic Okonedo as Paul's wife Tatiana who also provides some soul and tenderness yet a stern anger fueled turn. Inevitably there are comparisons to ""Schindler's List"", ""The Killing Fields"" and even ""Casablanca"" yet the film stands alone in its defiance to what mob mentality is about and how prejudice is much deeper than what is on the surface. This is one of the most inspiring, harrowing journeys into fear and is one of the year's very best."
"A searing indictment of the West's complete refusal to do Anything 11 years ago. When the Rwandan massacres began, it was like a dam burst-the Hutu president's plane is shot down, and the violence tore across that country for 100 days. I remember the news--500,000, 800,000, maybe up to a million people were butchered. We did Nothing. White people from away got out, and that was all. I have always been a Clinton fan but that was his worst moment, being too scared of committing to another Somalia to do so much as send in a single GI.So here you have the Hotel, a four-star swanky oasis during the genocide's, w/ Don Cheadle bribing every general or bigwig Hutu in sight to stay alive, stay in business, and keep the huddled Tutsis inside alive for yet another day, a week, month, 'til freedom finally comes at the end. Cheadle is incredible in this. He deserved an Oscar.It's played very much as a Schindler's List goes Africa, from the point of view of the Hotel. You wind up only seeing the violence here, here, and there, whenever the sea of war hits the Hotel itself before moving on again.The most jarring scenes--the van load of Tutsi's surrounded by militia in the street, w/ a desperate Cheadle bribing them to their freedom, the 'bumpy road' which turns out to be acres of bodies lying hacked to death as far's the eye can see, and of course the separation from his wife. I found myself wincing especially in the 'bumpy road' section. The mind reels at such ugliness, and cannot grasp the sheer magnitude of what really happened there.Kudus to Nick Nolte and the actress who played the wife, both were top notch as well.Do check this one out, it will break your heart and anger you at the same time.***1/2 outta ****"
"Like most ethnic conflicts around the world, the divisions in Rwanda between the majority Hutus and the minority Tutsis have long antecedents, in this case the invasion of the Rwanda highlands by the Tutsis from Ethiopia in the 15th century. However, it was Belgium - who ruled the country under a UN mandate from 1918 to 1961 - who institutionalised the discrimination by favouring Tutsis and introducing identity cards which specified the holders ethnic group. The spark which lit the tinder was the shooting down of the aircraft carrying the Hutu President on 6 April 1994. In the next 100 days, there was a ferocious outbreak of genocide orchestrated by the Interahamwe militia and sanctioned by the Hutu government in which around 800,000 mostly Tutsis were massacred while the world community failed to intervene. A decade later, a kind of collective guilt sees the release of no less than four films about these events, the most high profile being ""Hotel Rwanda"" which garnered three Academy Award nominations.Portraying death on this scale in a work of 'entertainment' almost demands that we observe the savagery through the prism of selected individuals and, in this case, Irish writer and director Terry George has chosen to use the real-life experience of hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina and his family. Rwanda is often called 'Le pays des Milles Collines' (the Land of a Thousand Hills) and Paul worked at the Sabena-owned Hotel des Mille Collines, a four-star establishment in the capital of Kigali. A well-educated Hutu, he was married to a Tutsi and had three young children, so he was geographically and ethnically at the heart of the madness. Like a kind of Oskar Schindler, he used a mixture of simple bribery and his sharp wits, together with charm and even obsequiousness, to create a haven in the horror that enabled 1,268 mainly Tutsis to survive.America actor Don Cheadle, who played a cockney fool in ""Ocean's Eleven"" & ""Ocean's Twelve"", gives a powerful and textured performance here which marks him out as someone who is going to become an A-list star, while able British actress Sophie Okonedo is his wife Tatiana (Tutsis are lighter-skinned and finer-featured), and it is such a change to see the leading roles in a movie taken by black actors. The fear and powerlessness of the hotel occupants - over a thousand men, women and children crammed into a 113-room establishment - is well created and sustained. The settings are very realistic, being largely shot in Johannesburg, and most of the technical and support crew were African. The focus of the action is the hotel itself and the violence is deliberately understated and left largely to the imagination.While one does not wish to see killing portrayed gratuitously, this artistic decision runs the risk that a largely ignorant western audience fails to appreciate the true nature and scale of this machete-fuelled rampage of rape and murder but, this reservation aside, ""Hotel Rwanda"" is an important and worthy work that should serve as a political warning of the price of international inaction in the face of ethnic conflict. Paul Rusesabagina, now lives in Belgium with his family, and recently told the US ""People"" magazine: ""What happened in Rwanada is now happening in Darfur, in the Congo, in all of these places they are butchering innocent civilians. It is high time we know that a human life in Africa is as important as a human life in the west."""
"""Hotel Rwanda"" gives a first-hand account of the genocide that occurred between the two main tribes in Rwanda, the Hutus and the Tutsis. Paul Rusesabagina (Cheadle) is the manager of a luxury hotel in the area that caters to the wealthy and to government figures. Outside of the gates of the resort, Tutsis are being killed by the Hutu militia, and though Paul (a Hutu) is married to Tatiana (Okonedo) (a Tutsi) for the sake of his family, he turns a blind eye until his in-laws disappear and the militia literally come to his doorstep demanding his cooperation and the surrender of his wife, children and neighbors. With the diplomacy that he has learned in his job he is able to barter with them, basically paying a great deal of money for the lives of his family and neighbors. Meanwhile, Col. Oliver (Nolte), who is with the United Nations, is trying to help the refugees and keep some semblance of order, but is forced to evacuate only the Caucasian residents of the hotel, leaving all of the Rwandans (both Tutsi and Hutus that are Tutsi sympathizers) to fend for themselves, which leads Paul to open the hotel to over 1,000 Tutsi refugees. There they try desperately to get out of the country, and ultimately, survive since the Hutu militia is now targeting any sympathizers as well.From about fifteen minutes into ""Hotel Rwanda"", I was pretty upset, and that feeling didn't go away once. Don Cheadle is incredibly good as a conflicted hero. Many comparisons have been made between this film and ""Schindler's List"", but if there is a way to rate levels of heroship, Paul Rusesabagina as portrayed in the film is pretty high up there. He is repeatedly given the chance to escape unharmed, but never gives in, a big turnaround from the beginning of the film when he first turned a blind eye, then became a reluctant hero. Cheadle captures this complicated figure brilliantly. It's not just the superficial coups that he achieves (flawless accent, etc.) it is the subtle strength he gives the character. His character may not be a beloved singer or a good impersonation of someone, but the strength of his performance should have given him an Oscar, not just a nomination. (Though I am glad that he at least got that much.) This is the first film that I have seen Sophie Okonedo act in, and she also extremely good. She quickly shows that she is more than a pretty face, and her strength and mettle are admirable, while experiencing the worst atrocities first hand.As a film, ""Hotel Rwanda"" was not manipulative emotional. Under Terry George's direction, it felt at times like a documentary because it was truly an unblinking look at a terrible and shameful time in history. Though I had heard about the genocide, I was not fully aware of the ""reasons"" for the war, and as completely ridiculous as they were, the film is excellent at providing us a lesson in recent history without commentary. As far as I can tell, this is a pretty level look at the conflict and while it was incredibly emotional, it was not preachy. While I mention that it had an almost documentary feel to it, which is not to say that there were dramatic moments. One moment in particular where I literally felt like I was going to be sick was when Paul (in what was probably his defining moment) encounters literally hundreds of dead bodies on a road that he and one of his hotel employees are traveling. Having said that, however, even a moment like this one was managed with care and subtlety by George.I was telling some co-workers about the film and its emotional impact and a couple of them who hadn't seen it went, ""Gee  that sounds too depressing for me"". ""Hotel Rwanda"" is certainly not a cheerful film, it is a film about a conflict that ended the lives of one million people in a matter of months while most of the world turned a blind eye. But it amazingly ends on a note that did not make me want to find the nearest closed garage and turn on the car, and left me with a newly found understanding of something I had only heard about and until Saturday night, knew nothing about. ""Hotel Rwanda"" is not an easy film to watch, but it is really and truly an excellent film that should be seen, both for its impactful storytelling and for its command performances. 8/10 --Shelly"
"This review contains spoilers...Hollywoodization is a term used to describe the changing of factual events in order to make them more marketable to the masses, like changing the events, throwing in a love interest and always removing hard questions.In Hotel Rwanda's case, the hollywoodization occurred within this movie, when the theme of genocide was decided to be played down in order to appeal to a wider audience of moviegoers, this is ultimately the films demise.Don Cheadle gives an incredibly Oscar worthy performance in what would otherwise be a mediocre film that had the potential to be the next ""Schindlers List"" but failed. Cheadle plays a hotel manager and a good family man caught up in the events leading to and ultimately transpiring during the Rwandan genocide in 1993.The majority of the film takes place with Paul (Cheadle) and his family refugees inside the Hotel Paul is the manager of. The actual genocide that is the main plot device of the movie is given very brief screen time and the majority of the scenes dealing with it, is the aftermath of it.Joaquin Phoenix's character, a journalist does give us a quick look at a very distant and out of context shot of two Rwandan's murdering a young girl, but Joaquin Phoenix has very little screen time and as quickly as he came into the film, he is almost quicker out of it leaving Cheadle to occupy the screen on his own.However, Cheadle has his family with him, most notably his wife, Sophie Okonedo who is the epitome of the word ""melodrama"", her prescence is one of many anchors to the film and she could have done with much less screen time as she only brings Cheadle down in the scenes she shares with him. Her emotions jump backwards and forwards in all of her scenes, it's as if she suffers from Bipolar disorder, having just witnessed a massacre outside of the hotel she is outraged and crying, then seconds later is laughing and enjoying a drink with her husband who is trying to romance her, talk about inappropriate, it's as if there is no genocide occurring outside of the Hotel, and for all the film portrays, there is not.The next biggest flaw with the film was the decision to cast Nick Nolte, who is in my opinion a good actor, as long as he is playing himself (such as he was in Affliction), but this time he isn't playing himself, he is playing a composite of General Romeo Dallaire named Colonel Oliver, who has NONE of Dallaire's qualities as a human being. Nolte drags on with his dialogue and it is my opinion that he was most likely intoxicated while filming took place, he looks confused, tired and hung over the entire film, not exactly military material. He bumbles, is incompetent and gets drunk on duty, is this the film makers idea to make Cheadle a more effective hero? By disqualifying everyone else of the role? In 1993, 800,000 souls were murdered and millions of others died as refugees and instead of showing this and letting the world know, we see Paul and his wife enjoying cocktails with Colonel Oliver, while their countrymen are being murdered just outside their doors.A mediocre film that suffered from hollywoodization, for an actually emotional film that deals with the tragedies in Rwanda, I would suggest seeing ""Shake Hands With the Devil"", a film that does not suffer from hollywoodization and will leave you questioning humanity.Cheadle was good, the rest of the movie was not.6/10"
"""Never have so many owed so much to so few"" - Winston Churchill.I think this quote best describes the atmosphere highlighted in this magnificent film. What Paul Rusesebagina did to help the helpless Tutsis families by sheltering them in his hotel was proof that everyone of us can make a change for the better. The story is simply amazing and shocking at the same time - the feeling of regret and compassion was amplified by the fact that this movie was based on a true story. Don Cheadle delivers an outstanding performance.His acting is flawless - he manages to actually bring the viewer into the harsh Rwandian environment of the 1994 events. He skillfully points out the torment which Paul Rusesebagina faced! Sophie Okonedo also plays very well in this movie, masterfully playing the role of the determined and loving mother willing to do anything to save her children. Nick Nolte is superb in playing remorse haunted Colonel Oliver of the UN forces and Joaquin Phoenix does a great job on playing the character of Jack Daglish, the cameraman in charge to bring footage of the massacre. What strikes me at this movie is the remarkable resemblance between Paul Rusesebagina and Oskar Schindler, two men who risked their lives to save other people and who, against all odds, succeeded in achieving this.Through their actions, they saved the entire world, saved it from forgetting the fact that we are all humans and a right to live on this planet!All in all, this movie is superb and greatly deserves a spot in the Top 250! 9/10"
"'Hotel Rwanda' tells the story of hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) who used his skills to save over a thousand people during the terrible events that happened in Rwanda in the early nineties. Tutsis were slaughtered by Hutus simply because they were Tutsi, while the rest of the world was looking away. The way the United Nations acted here is portrayed by Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte), the only fictional person in the movie.First we learn about the way Paul, a Hutu, handles things in the hotel; he is a good manager, keeping the important customers happy with little gifts. They may come in handy later in his life. We meet Paul's wife Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo), who is a Tutsi. Then the massacre starts and slowly more and more people try to hide in the hotel, protected by just a few UN soldiers who are not allowed to use their weapons.In more than one way I was reminded of 'Schindler's List'. Schindler started to save people only to make money, but ended up caring for all of them. Paul's reasons are less selfish than making money, although at first he only wants to save his own family with the power he has. Paul also ends up caring for every single soul he can save. Both men stood up against a greater power with the risk of being killed. 'Schindler's List' is the better movie, mostly because it was amazing how it told a story about one man but gave us a strong impression of the Holocaust surrounding him. 'Hotel Rwanda' has some scenes that have that effect as well, but overall it feels more of a movie that plays on a smaller scale. Of course Steven Spielberg is also a better director than Terry George.Still, the movie is very powerful and moving. Like I said, there are scenes that are close to unbelievable, showing once again what mankind is able to. Performances are helpful here, especially Cheadle does a superb job showing a smart man slowly losing hope. There is one complaint (one that also counts for 'Schindler's List') I have here. The people in Rwanda were not speaking English as their main language, but they were definitely not speaking English with accents. Maybe it makes it more realistic for an English speaking audience, it does not for most others. Just let them speak their original language or normal English. You didn't see the people from 'Gladiator' speak English with a Latin accent either and it worked just fine."
"Hotel Rwanda The true story of a man who saved over 1000 people (many of them very young children) from slaughter. Close to a million Tutsis died because the west didn't want to risk the lives of 300 of their own - these 300 people who have histories, families, loved ones, blah blah who were so much more important and valuable apparently. Instead of sending in the requested urgent intervention to protect over a million people marked for death, the west washed their hands of these people.Based on the footage I have seen from various documentaries on the genocide, I believe that this film is an entirely accurate portrayal of what happened (except, of course, the language would have been French, not English). Filmed on site in Kigali, the painstaking attention to detail in the film made you realise exactly what it would have felt like to witness the situation unfold right before your eyes. I feel I can understand how it's possible to not see (or believe) something like that is imminent until too late. We all ""have"" these reassurances in the back of our minds that this sort of thing can't happen, that humanity won't let it happen, that someone in power somewhere will make sure this kind of thing won't happen. That surely it's someone's job somewhere to ensure this can't happen.I watched this film with my friend Lucy, who was in Rwanda as an aid worker shortly after the genocide - she's even been to the hotel itself.But what you realise is that, in reality, you really can be abandoned by the world, even if they know FULL WELL what's going to happen to you, even if they know FULL WELL that they'll regret not helping when they should have and be so very ashamed of themselves later. Humans seem to sometimes prefer to be ashamed later than to risk their necks in the now.You forget you're sitting in a cinema - you are in Rwanda for those 2 hours. I felt a whole spectrum of emotions - I was scared, sad, horrified, angry, I felt the tension and relief for the characters at every turn, etc as the scenes unfolded.Lucy said it best - we were both shell-shocked when we came out. I had my tissue in my hand."
"2004, at least late 2004, may turn out to be the greatest period of cinema in the last 20 years at least. With the brilliance of such films as Million Dollar Baby and Finding Neverland and this heavy hitter but sadly under rated Hotel Rwanda. How does a film like this not get nominated for Best Picture by the Academy? Hotel Rwanda is the true story of Hotel Manager Paul Rusesabagina during the most turbulent time of Rwandan history. The two warring factions the Hutu's and the Tutsis are almost reaching a peace agreement when the Rwandan Presient is assassinated. Paul is big time businessman who spends his time making top connections in the event he needs to call in favors during war time. When war breaks out, Paul finds himself involuntarily harboring refugees in his hotel. As he is gradually immersed in horrifying images and war crimes against his own people, he stands strong and helps over 1200 refugees and saves their lives.Don Cheadle is amazing, he's always been a talented actor but Hotel Rwanda will launch his leading acting career. His leadership qualities and his role is amazing. I must admit, I find the supporting cast, including his wife, played by Sophie Okonedo, Nick Nolte, brief appearance by Joaquin Phoenix, and the hotel staff are certainly adequate but no one particularly stand out especially against Don Cheadle's role. But the cast really isn't what makes this movie a true astonishing film. It's the writing and the film making and the story, combined with Don Cheadle's role. Terry George focus's on the true horror of the Genocide situation, and Paul's struggle to save his own family but not at the cost of everyone else. He is determined to not let anyone die. The scenes of the bodies are disturbing and will bring tears to your eyes, and you feel Paul's compassion for this people. This might not be a well remembered event but after experiencing Hotel Rwanda, you won't ever forget it. It's without a doubt one of the best pictures you will see this year!! 10/10"
"I saw Hotel Rwanda last night, 2 years after its release. I had heard a lot about it, and was expecting (as many people said) a new 'Schindler's List'.I am sorry to say that a theme, even when so important and shamefully unspoken as the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, doesn't necessary make a masterpiece.The cinematography was as ugly, televisionized and cake-like as possible; the characters weren't well developed. the movie was fairly acted, nothing more. (except for Sophie Okonedo, she was a real revelation).But most of all, that terrible genocide is barely shown. And it is extremely cleaned up. Bodies here and there. Almost no blood. But the images that came out of that event in 1994 were way different and shocking. There were so many butchered corpses in the rivers that you almost couldn't see the water. They really used machetes to slaughter them. Children did it, under the use of drugs. This movie shows a sugary version of it all, and doesn't make you feel the terror and the horror of these days. By filming it so, this genocide seems almost accepted and closed. It has happened, that's it.It probably made a lot of people feel shame for their ignorance, that is already something. Many probably documented themselves, thank god. Maybe some learned some more about Africa today. But this doesn't make it a good movie.What a disappointment. What a missed occasion. I wish Kevin MacDonald (The Last King of Scotland) or Fernando Meirelles (Cidade de Deus) or someone of that level directed it. Not this TV-movie director."
"The only possible explanation I can think of for the high regard and score for this film is that people are reviewing the theme, or the intentions, rather than the movie itself. I found the script incredibly puerile. I felt embarrassed for the actors having to say lines like ""How can people be so cruel?"" or Joaquin Phoenix exclaiming ""I feel so ashamed"" because a porter holds an umbrella over his head. It was no surprise to learn that the writer, an editor, wrote it in his spare time, and had not written anything before. There are no rounded characters, only mouthpieces for the humanitarian message that the writers are trying to convey. The story is decent enough, and there are some effective scenes such as a convoy of vehicles driving into an ambush, but all of these play better with the sound down. The dialog was more suited to a Steven Seagal action movie than a fact-based movie with serious pretensions. The director resorted too easily to slushy music to tell the audience how to feel. And the characters were paper-thin: the hero who loves children and animals, the angelic aid worker, the cowardly bad guys. Given the subject matter, this review will probably come across as mealy-mouthed and uncharitable. But this is a site for reviewing movies, not causes."
This movie moved me to tears because the way it depicted the ordinary lives of several African citizens caught in a local war zone and the chaos that ensues. Brilliant acting and performers all around but especially from Don Cheadle's lead character who must make horrifying decisions. An absolute MUST SEE!
"British Co-writer, producer/director Terry George (The Promise '17) has certainly carved out a name for being a maker of films to give us cause to think. He's also capable of showing the un-show able without resorting to sensationalised cinema 'stylized' violence - in fact, his great control allows us to be horrified & moved to tears with a remarkable lack of explicitness. So effective is his approach, the viewer feels as though they were watching an unfolding documentary account. His performers give remarkably convincing portrayals, leaving no doubt that cast and crew all shared Mr George's passion for this tragic cause. Excellent production values ensure an involving experience without overdone visual CGI excesses - making all that we do see so convincingly real. Some have drawn comparisons to Schindler's List but, that was stylized Hollywood, where' Rwanda' is all raw soul - giving it a far more compelling believability. Much of the world apologised for its inaction --after the event-- but only following certain serving personnel and press witnesses having publicly shamed them into doing so. This brings into question the true effectiveness of the UN - and the responsibility of the politically 'economic' heart of the developed world."
"While America was transfixed by O.J. Simpson and his low-speed chase in a white Ford Bronco, the worst humanitarian tragedy since WWII was taking place in Rwanda.Don Cheadle excels as the Hutu manager of a Belgian luxury hotel who does whatever is necessary to save as many people as possible while a Hutu militia, largely incited by government radio, engage in an unrelenting slaughter of Rwanda's Tutsi minority. Cheadle and the people he is trying to protect hold out in the hotel protected only by a small contingent of UN troops led by Nick Nolte, whose number one order is to avoid a firefight with the locals. Cheadle effectively balances diplomacy and bribery to keep the Hutu warlords out of the hotel and to buy precious time for him and his people to ride out the massacre. The film accurately portrays the total failure of the ""world community"" to take action that could have prevented the massacre of hundreds of thousands. The UN and other organizations have detailed files and reports of this occurrence that can be read on line by anyone who is interested in this. In those files you will learn there was a similar incident there in 1970 that claimed 100,000 lives. They're real good at writing up reports after the fact, but they were useless in preventing or limiting this tragedy. That's essentially what this movie tells us as well."
"I had it seen it long ago on the big screen. Then about five minutes of the film on TV last night and it got me again. In the rain, the bus departing, the children singing. Don Cheadle is a man of many faces. This was one of his most remarkable. The quiet dignity in the face of the unspeakable in order to provide safety for others. It was very different from some of his other roles, yet he inhabits this one a hundred percent. The Academy still owes his an award."
"Grim subject matter aside, this is a jewel of a movie which I hope with every fiber of my being you will watch. Compassion, corruption, fear, violence, hate, love, integrity and honor are the highlights of this film. The world stands by while terrible things happen all the time. We have no choice sometimes. We're far away, politically disconnected, we feel powerless. The cognitive dissonance pounds our hearts at times.What chimes in my heart the most about this movie is that this is actually the sole theme of the movie. It is not overpowered by moral preaching, it does coerce you into feeling anything specific, it's purpose is simply to allow you to feel SOMETHING about what is happening; whether it be yesterday, 1994 Rwanda, or today with Syria. It gives you a road map and empowers you. It's incredibly inspiring. Words cannot explain.Sometimes, feeling something is the best you can do. Reflect, learn and try to be one of the good ones. Be a hero in your own little world. You do what you can do be good, at the cost of witnessing certain atrocities and being restricted in what you can do about it. Just do what you can, when you can. (I speak of the protagonist's role and not the world, in this particular situation, the world was most certainly not heroic) And sometimes, when you can do that, you may not know it at the time, but you become something bigger; a real hero. This is a movie about the dignity of fear, of monsters at every turn and above all else, it is a movie to help you define what it is to be a hero, a true real life hero. Not the MARVEL superhero kind, but those kind of people with hearts so big that they make you feel grateful to be human.In the very midst of hell happening on earth, the protagonist, brilliantly brought to life by Don Cheadle, feels the events and makes small decisions. That is all. And you watch him. This movie makes the world feel it. The moment of it. The smallness he feels and the enormity of the world at the same time. You feel it. It's a pure sentiment distilled down to its purest form and that is the very premise of the movie.Bad things happen, we try to be good, we try to be strong, we do what we can and keep our chins up. The beauty of being human is that you decide how to react to the world, in all its contrasting colors and beautiful madness, you too can find honor, valor, humility, integrity -- MEANING -- PURPOSE.What a brilliant shining beacon of light this movie was.... despite being at the same time a grimmest saddest and most harrowing foray into the darkness of the human spirit. All at the same time. A true masterpiece.I must note that the powerlessness I feel after watching this movie is a bit overwhelming, but it has sparked something in me. I am not very political, but my views have now been changed. I suspect the director and writer and actors would be pleased that I feel restless to go out into the world and do something good now."
"In the face of true human evil, Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) stood up and said Not on my Watch. Cheadle plays the real-life role of hotel manager during the 1994 genocide of the Tutsi sect people by the Hutu sect majority. At the beginning of the film, before the killing starts, you learn that people were arbitrarily assigned to one of the two sects based on physical characteristics, which makes the killing even more unbelievable.Hotel Des Milles Collines is the one place of refuge in the middle of mayhem once the genocide starts. Cheadle uses guile, tactics, stalling, bargaining, bribing, begging, every tool in his toolkit to try to save as many as he can. Reminiscent of Schindler's List, Hotel Rwanda shows what one compassionate man can mean to so many others' lives when he's the only one that can do anything.Rusesabagina loves his family, and that is portrayed over and over again, especially in many heart-wrenching scenes with his wife when he tells her what she must do if death comes near them.Tension, plot, great acting, despair. Nick Nolte is terrific as the UN peacekeeper leader who has guns but no mandate or authority to use them. Excellent acting by the evil General and the evil supplier. The way the Director Terry George portrays the carnage, especially the river road scene, will stay with you for a long time. Genocide never makes sense, is never understandable to the sane person, but never has it been so palpably seen as in Hotel Rwanda. thankfully the Hollywood ending is actually true. If you have time, watch some of the special features where the real Paul Rusesabagina talks about the reality of that time. This movie will restore your faith in good people doing amazing things when faced with evil. Enjoy."
"Not since Cry Freedom has a film so honestly told the story of one man.Not since Schindler's List has a film so frankly highlighted the atrocities of a 20th Century conflict.Not since Uprising has a film so sincerely shown the efforts of a small few to assist helpless refugees.This film is a powerful and compelling story of the strength of one man, Paul Rusesabagina, who opened the doors of his hotel to 1000 refugees when civil war broke out in 1994. It is open and honest in its depiction of the neglect the world showed by turning it's back on the situation. In its dealing of the situation, the film manages to construct hope and doses of humour amongst tense and frightening situations.The acting is stellar, with Don Cheadle (Paul Rusesabagina) in the performance of his career providing true despair and emotion throughout the film. Sophie Okenedo as Paul's wife Tatiana is superb in bringing real concern and fear to the role. Even Nick Nolte surprised me in his characterisation of Colonel Oliver (real life: Romeo Dallaire).In its depiction of the horrific event, the film deals with themes and issues including racism, family, politics, culture and religion. All these issues are dealt with in an honest and sincere way.Although the film holds back on showing horrific scenes of genocide, it manages to draw much emotion from the audience, moving many viewers to tears (myself included). This is largely due to the actors ability and the structuring of the crucial scenes.This is not a film for someone who wants simply to be entertained. This is not a film for the lighthearted. It is film for those who wish to become enlightened as to the horrific events of 1994. See this film for its historical benefit (as well as it excellent script and acting). This is the first (in my knowledge) feature film made about the event and those involved. The film has very very few flaws; it is a perfect depiction of the efforts of Paul Rusesabagina.Much like its historical counterparts (Cry Freedom, Schindler's List and Uprising), it is an accurate and truthful representation of the events. However, if one thing should be said to make the film more powerful it would be to have included a little more (in the story) of the genocide and to tie up one (or two) loose ends. However, the filmmakers clearly made this film in the hope of telling Paul Ruseasbagina's story with the 'backdrop' / setting being the Rwanda Civil War. So it can be overlooked if this was the intention.An excellent film!!! Kudos to all!"
"In a less competitive year, this film would have received its due as an Oscar contender. In addition to the top notch lead acting performances (which did receive nods), the movie tells a compelling story in a manner that perfectly balances horror with humanity. Mel Gibson could use lessons from this director in how much more effective suffering can be conveyed when it is done with more subtlety and restraint so the audience is never numbed by tragedy, but rather is kept constantly feeling with the characters so as to even laugh with them at the occasional light moment.The script may not be conventionally catchy in terms of original dialogue, but it allows the film to move well while presenting many of the characters (even some of the villains) as three-dimensional human beings. When people do things -- even those that may seem unwise -- we understand why they made that choice, which avoids the ""why would anyone do that"" problems that so annoy me in other movies.All in all, the film that should have had the ""Million Dollar Baby"" or ""Ray"" slot on Oscar night."
"For me, Terry George's Hotel Rwanda was easily the best and most memorable movie of 2004. It's difficult to call a movie about a terrible tragedy such as the Rwandan genocide of 1994, but in every aspect, this movie is excellent. Yes, the movie is one of the most upsetting pieces I have ever seen, but this is only an indication of the greatness of the Hotel Rwanda. The actors (especially Cheadle) are so believable in each of their roles, that it does not take long for the audience to take an interest in the main figures, their lives, and the lives of their friends and neighbors. This fact makes the suffering of those who witnessed and fell during the Rwandan massacre both on film and in actuality so much more real.Also, much credit must be given to the director, Terry George. In a film revolving around an incidence of genocide (in which many victims were hacked to death with machetes no less) it would be easy for the story and tragedy to be lost amidst a depiction of the excessive violence that occurred. However, while there is obviously a good share of violence in Hotel Rwanda, George avoids excessive gore and instead relies more on fear to express the suffering of the refugees at Rusesabagina's hotel. George instead shows the aftermath of violence (hundreds of corpses covering a road), the threat of violence, and especially, feelings of alienation and separation (the abandonment of Rwandan refugees by the western world). All these elements really draw the audience in and force the viewers to feel the pain and suffering felt by the refugees.The excellence of Hotel Rwanda also makes it a very humbling movie. It forces those who live in the western world to acknowledge the atrocities that resulted from their countries pretending a massive problem did not exist. Possibly the most depressing fact that Hotel Rwanda asserts is in the last image of the entire movie, where simple white words on a black background remind the audience that nearly a million people died during this period of genocide, a toll that may have been dramatically lessened had the world not turned its back. Thus, in its greatness, the movie is also very shaming, a fitting feeling given the words of Rusesabagina in the movie, ""we must shame them into acting."" More than once I was reduced to tears watching this movie, as were many other members of the (unfortunately) slim audience present in the theater. Truly, this is a movie that all should see."
"10/10 Best way to describe this movie is a cross between Schindler's List and The Pianist - two of the most powerful films I've ever seen. While Paul's (Don Cheadle) situation continues to get worse as the movie progresses just like Adrien Brody, he does whatever he can to help the Tutsi and Hutu refugees at his hotel. Cheadle is gripping - this from a man who has played a wide range of roles from a porn star with an identity crisis in Boogie Nights to Sammy Davis Jr. in the Rat Pack - and he supplements the troubling story of the country's civil war and genocide with a flawless performance. I immediately wanted to research the Rwanda situation after I saw the movie to learn more than the little I already knew - it truly was a war fought for outrageous reasons, and the ignorance of the rest of the world (something the movie did well to convey) at that time is hard to imagine. I would give Cheadle the nod for Best Actor, and the movie is a must-see for people of all backgrounds. An amazing film."
"My husband and I saw Hotel Rwanda and were very touched by it's content. It is one of the most powerful movies that I have ever seen!! Since we saw the movie I have told EVERYONE that I talk to, to go see this movie!!(even total strangers) We had intended to see another movie but heard that it did not get good ratings. This movie deserves an A+!! My husband loves to watch the history channel so I knew he would be very interested in seeing Hotel Rwanda since it is based on a true story. I haven't seen ANY previews or promotions of any kind and had not even heard of it before we went. In my opinion, this movie should receive MANY Academy Awards and EVERYONE should see it!!"
"Under the security blanket of America, we tend to forget or ignore the destruction that is occurring throughout the world. We may catch a glimpse of the danger present in foreign countries, but we put it off as out of our control. Yet Hotel Rwanda shows the viewer the tragic consequences of inaction in the face of genocide.The main character of Hotel Rwanda is Paul Rusesabagina, a hotel manager who looks out for his family in Rwanda, and who stands as an innocent bystander in Rwanda's civil war between the Hutu and the Tutsis. The Hutu forces are on the attack, and although Paul is Hutu, he must take a stand to protect the Tutsis being persecuted. His wife, Tatiana, a Tutsi, does not face the situation as calmly as Paul, because she is very protective of her children. These two main performances are extremely impressive and bring a lot of the emotional power of the film as well as to the characters themselves. Supporting cast includes Nick Nolte as Colonel Oliver from the UN and Joaquin Phoenix as a cameraman who catches on film the atrocities of the occurrences outside the ever-crumbling walls of the hotel. Nolte does a very good job in his position of helplessness, but Phoenix puts in a far less-impressive bit role.The screenplay, written by Keir Pearson and Terry George is very good, and the dialogue shows the strength of a few, the helplessness of many, and the evil of those who started executing innocent people out of their own selfish ambition. The film reminds us, albeit through simple direction, of the destruction of which we as human beings are capable, but it also shows us the power of love for others. Some parts of the film are so hard to watch and so emotional, that one cannot help but remember them vividly. The power of Gregson-Williams' and Guerra's score stands out especially in such scenes.If only films with such heart could be made without flaw! Although the flaws are outweighed, in my mind, by the film's message and stunning images, they must be mentioned. As I alluded to earlier, the acting of those in smaller roles is below par. Also, there seemed to be a kind of alacrity of direction throughout the film, as if George were attempting to speed through the film. This does not take much from the film's power, but the viewer is left with little time to take in each specific scene in order to understand the movie as a whole. Further, the song played in the credits, ""Million Voices,"" seems poorly hashed together, so that the viewer cannot think to his full potential upon the film in all its intensity.Ironically enough, the film's strength increases when we see that we too are in a sense responsible for the genocide in Rwanda, because we leave the theater still unwilling to take action to help the helpless. The film is sadly flawed, but incredible in its message and force.Final Grade: B+."
"My wife and I watched this movie in Fremantle yesterday afternoon and although I had a rough idea about what I was about to watch, the actual movie was far stronger than I had anticipated. The producer, director and writer, Terry George, must be congratulated for bringing to the screen such a horrendous story and yet making that story palatable to the extent that it is nominated for Academy Awards in a number of categories. Beyond that I was struck by the deftness with which he handled the unthinkable through elucidating the reasons the civil war massacres were taking place-the anger that motivated the participants. So often writers leave the audience in complete dark as to these motivations for some terrible event-the perpetrators are: simply fill in the words-mad, evil, stupid, directed, etc. We disagree with the bloodletting but we have no reasons to account for it.Georges decision to cast Dan Cheadle in the lead role was inspirational-Cheadle handled a demanding role so well that I thought I was watching TV footage or a documentary. All the actors were superb and all contributed to this total feeling of ""realness."" I could talk about every person on the screen but perhaps my favourite was Fano Mokoena who played the Huto general who maintained the hotel sanctuary. Beyond Mokoena was Nick Nolte's portrayal of a Canadian Peace Keeper-I love Nolte's work but this small role was one of his best.Please see the movie-it's one of those rare movies that has so much light to shed on a piece of history people would rather not see."
"Can I just say wow. This movie is so moving. I haven't cried in a theater in such a long time. Don Cheadle has become one of my favorite actors. He does such an amazing job. He deserves to win that Oscar. Highly recommend this movie. Soooo good. The whole situation that is going on over in Africa is so sad. I mean why are we not doing anything. This movie has opened my eyes so much. I have only heard of the genocide on the news briefly, but this movie has made me more aware and I think it will make anyone who watches it more aware of what is going on over there. Another minor note, I thought all the actors in this movie did a superb job. Definitely the movie of the year and has become one of my favorites."
"I'm so glad I went to see Hotel Rwanda. At first I avoided it because I was afraid it would be too violent or political. But the film handled this brilliantly. The emotion and violence of the events are evident but you don't see the worst directly.The movie reminded me of other political films. But this one is so much more uplifting and entertaining. It's truly a human story that's so much more effective because it's true. You see the events mainly through one man's eyes. It really is a hero film that shows how tragedy can bring out the best in people not just for caring about others, but for being strong, calm and setting an example."
"I'm going to put it this way - movies do not usually get to me. Even if I cry, laugh, scream, etc...I'm not usually bothered on a deeper level. ""Hotel Rwanda"" actually hurt to watch, but in a positive way. I was completely drawn into the movie, and the fact that I knew it was based on actual events made it that much more compelling. The only other movie I can possibly think of to compare it to is ""Schindler's List."" This movie reminded me of why I go see movies. Not only did I enjoy the film and the acting (Don Cheadle is amazing), but it made me want to learn more about the actual events in Rwanda which I am ashamed to admit I don't know that much about. I don't know if this comment will actually make anyone want to go see the movie, but I had to voice a comment for this movie. Best movie I have seen in years."
"This film is a documentary of man's inhumanity to man and is a very disturbing film. Don Cheadle is very good in his part and is certainly worthy of nomination for an Academy Award, although I do not think his performance is as good as Leonard DeCaprio in the Aviator or Jamie Foxx who was Ray in the movie of the same name. The rest of the cast was very good in their parts, but I was disappointed in the bit part that Nick Nolte had in this fine picture. It is a shame to see some one so talented have his career go down the tubes because of a drinking problem. You have to have a strong stomach to watch this film but if you do you will be richly rewarded. We need more of the fine writing that is done in this film Hotel Rwanda. Go see this one you will be richly rewarded."
"I just saw Hotel Rwanda. I don't know what to say... actually i do.But it's so much that i want to say it would take me several pages to write it all down. A quick summary then: Don Cheadle should get the Oscar (and if he doesn't then Jamie Foxx will), the story is magnificent, the acting overall superb, it was brought in a moving, awakening way. But not much in a 'Hollywood-style', Thank God.That's what I have to say about the movie, now for the story behind the movie.... I'm ashamed to be someone from Western World when I see this movie, something like this should never happen again, i would advice as many people to see this and become aware of what was and is happening in this world gone crazy...One more thing, anyone who doesn't even have one tear in is eye at some point in this movie has a heart of stone."
"For any human with a social conscious this movie is an absolute imperative. Powerful, beautiful, heart-wrenching and tearful. I took my four daughters ages 18 to 29, none of whom were familiar with this historical situation. None of them, including myself, had a dry eye. The inhumanity that humans direct towards each other continues to perplex and amaze me. Yet, in the midst of this genocide someone like Paul Rusesabagina steps forward and exhibits the true spirit of human compassion and love for each other. Paying attention to situations like this, occurring right now, all over our globe, helps us to become more aware that we are all in this life together. All humans truly desire the same things, health, food, shelter, education and peace. Why can't we just look at each other as one big family? GO SEE THIS MOVIE...NOW !"
"I just saw this movie earlier today and I remember the headlines at the time of the crisis and never understood afterwards how so much slid by the public on information. Boy I have learned so much from this film and truly hope everyone will go see it. What a wonderful man to have taken up the burden of the crisis he was living amongst and to bear it when so many of the countries in the world turned their backs on him. I am ashamed of our world that we did not help in time and do hope that we as people can not grow cold to third world countries as well as the rest of the world. We are all in this world together period and we need to show love and compassion to all no matter what creed, nationality or even color of skin! God bless you and go see the film it is worth it Kim"
"*NOTE: I will point out all points where spoilers occur, so those of you who wish to avoid them can still get a critical opinion of the film from me, but I apparently must mark the review as containing spoilers, so I want to let everyone know that much of the review will still not contain spoilers*The most noticeably excellent part of ""Hotel Rwanda"" is the performance of Don Cheadle, who gives a wonderfully subtle and complete performance. Cheadle is able to let us know much about Paul Rusesabagina that would be easy to skip through brilliant small gestures. (*SPOILER* Notice the way he discerningly watches the military men in the hotel before the genocide begins--we see what a calculating, thoughtful man Rusesabagina is before we have much of anything that can tell us anything about him. *SPOILER OVER*) Sophie Okendo, Nick Nolte, and Joaquin Phoenix also give wonderful supporting performances (especially a surprising Nolte), but none is given a significant amount of time to breathe, because the film is about Paul and it is VERY focused.Many have said that the violence in this film is too little and thus distances us from the genocide, but there are reasons for this. First of all, the film is not really about the genocide--it's about Paul Rusesabagina, and it's focused on him nearly every second. Paul *SPOILER* only sees it when he and Gregoire are out running over bodies *SPOILER OVER*, and thus it cannot keep its focus on him without losing some violence. It also makes a point that the violence is too much for people--*SPOILER* Paul himself, Jack, and Roger are all rendered essentially mute when they see it: Paul has his emotional breakdown immediately after, Jack is silent while setting up his tape, and Roger is reduced to hiding scared silently, not even capable of telling his parents that it's not his blood *SPOILER OVER*. If the violence is too much for people to see, obviously we can't see much of it. It also makes the little pieces of violence we do see that much stronger that they are isolated.The dialog is very real and yet intelligent and the direction quiet, not trying to force too much on the viewer. The film is also quite heavily without score, lending even more weight and realism to the events depicted. The wonderfully focused script keeps us identifying with and watching Paul throughout the story, keeping him in constant, very real danger. The film even manages to get the story of how the Hutus and Tutsis emerged into it without seeming terribly forced, by bringing in a news team (including Joaquin Phoenix, who is rather quietly building up a very impressive body of work) to cover the events.All told, ""Hotel Rwanda"" is a great film depicting a truly remarkable story of a man doing wonderful things in an almost unbelievably terrible situation. The acting is top-notch, the writing is superb, the direction is as good as one can hope for, and the story has a powerful resonance to the point that it makes one think again about what nations' obligations to the people of another nation are. In an excellent year in film (three films that I would rank in probably the top 25 I've ever seen came out in 2004), ""Hotel Rwanda"" is one of the standouts and definitely the most powerful film to come out in a long time. Don't miss it."
"This movie completely blew me away. I really think that Don deserves the best actor and this movie should have been nominated, seriously people, when did a movie last do this to you. but it did end on a freeze frame which was a little ""breakfast club""-esquire....you know,...oh well. All in all I was really impressed with this movie and the soundtrack! If you haven't listened to it then you should check it out. Wyclef Jean finally has something with million voices. Anywho, you should most definitely check out this flick, lotsa great acting and a lot of great scenes just in general.-George"
"Every time I hear someone say there is no real ""good"" or ""evil"" in the world I think of things like Schindler's List, The Killing Fields, The Power of One and similar movies. Hotel Rwanda is now added to my list.This movie stirs the soul with a true story that is engaging, interesting, unspeakably sad, funny at times, and ultimately (for the lead focal family) triumphant. ButI kept asking myself while watching: Am I not related to all these people? Could I ever treat my fellow humans as cockroaches and vermin? How can people think of other people that way? If such a condition can exist in others, can it exist in me? If I saw human depravity around me, how much would I tolerate and wink at before I did something about it? And what WOULD I do about such things? Would I throw my hands up in hopelessness or would I find a way to alleviate pain and suffering? This movie is difficult to watch, yet it is important to watch. After watching it I felt closer to my family, friends, neighbors and others. Excellently portrayed. Not overly dramatic, yet poignant."
"Ever since seeing a program on television about the circumstances of the Rwandan genocide, I have become somewhat of a student of the issue. And sure, the Interahamwe didn't kill as many people as the Nazis, or even Pol Pot, but the brutality of slaughtering nearly a million people, most by machete, more than makes up for the numbers. And the abandonment, the sheer disregard for anything African that the West perpetrated on Rwanda, that should make all of us ashamed of our governments.You should see this movie. Everyone should see this movie. Exquisite performances by Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo bring to life the desperation of simply holding on to life with the proverbial barbarians at the gate (right at the gate, as it was), and all while Cheadle's Rusesabagina clings tenaciously to the image and prestige of his hotel, giving his best when everything else falls apart. How the real life Paukl managed to keep it all together, bribe the army, keep the militia at bay is nothing short of a miracle, and the cast brings that to you in such sharp detail that you can't feel anything but the utmost admiration and astonishment for everyone who kept it together.Rusesabagina, General Dallaire, and many others are the true measure of hero. They gave everything they had to make sure that 800,000 didn't turn into millions."
"Greetings again from the darkness. Don Cheadle's Academy Award nomination for Hotel Rwanda is a well deserved and a wonderful thing. Hopefully it will encourage even more to see director Terry George's incredibly moving tale of the 1994 Rwanda crisis between the Tutsis and the Hutu. As with Schindler's List, nothing is more powerful than a real life hero. Paul Rusesabagina is a real life hero. With the slaughter of nearly a million right outside his front gate, Paul R gave refuge to nearly 1000 who surely would have died. The tour de force by Cheadle is with his divergent performance from the elegant Hotel manager to the smooth negotiator to the passionate husband, parent and humanist. This man cares about people and what is right. Although, Nick Nolte's performance was slightly askew, the movie is well paced and heartfelt and should be seen by many. Very powerful."
"I can't even understand how this movie was not nominated for best picture in this year's Oscars. I can't say for sure until I see The Aviator, but Leonardo DiCaprio's performance better be SPECTACULAR to have beaten Don Cheadle for the Golden Globe (drama). I haven't seen a performance like that in a very long time. He and Sophie Okonedo were both incredible. It was very moving. It's hard to not feel like something is wrong with a world where we can live peacefully in America and people are living that way in Rwanda... still to this day. But as they say in the movie, people will see pictures of the genocide, say, ""how horrible"", and go back to eating dinner.... I recommend all people go see this movie!"
"I was conflicted for about two seconds before deciding to give a film like this a bad review, a film that I really am a minority in since it was widely praised and reached by some miraculous flight to number 62 in the IMDb top 250. It's just a shameless and grueling piece of film-making, and I can't help but feel disgusted that the Rwandan genocide has been reduced and distilled by Hollywood into this. The injustice is overbearing. As someone who was in lower Manhattan on 9/11, I resented Oliver Stone for making his swan song 'World Trade Center', another hand wringing piece of garbage that was so disconnected from the reality of the event it was laughable, which is terrible because the last thing you want is to see such an inaccurate reflection of events to where you are forced by the director to sneer and feel uncomfortable at a film about it. Believe me, people, there were no violins playing in Rwanda while this was going on. I appreciate how people are waking up to genocide and injustice in Africa and how Don Cheadle has taken his research from this film and gone on to bring tremendous public awareness to places like Sudan, but that is all I can give this.For one, it does nothing to speak of the actual problems that led to the genocide in the first place, leaving an audience that might not know about the lead up to this story (and I do think the target audience for this film has no idea where Rwanda is on a map) to come to the conclusion that there is such thing as 'faceless evil', as arbitrary as some of the worst crimes humanity has ever encountered are, things aren't this simple, black-white, right-wrong. I think this kind of mentality has led the way for Bush's statements on 'good and evil' and 'evildoers' to be taken at face value, without questioning the social, political, religious, or moral conflicts that might have led to an act of genocide like this, or an act like September 11. I suggest instead of watching this film and thinking you have learned something about history, you pick up a book like 'The Graves are Not Yet Full' to understand the complex dynamics in Africa, dynamics that have led to generations being wiped out by ethnic cleansing and tribal conflict. I worry that a film like this closes out on a still ongoing argument, leaving the viewer with a feeling that even in the face of humanity's most vile action, 'everything will be okay' with people like Paul Rusesabagina around. This simply is not true. This film made me viscerally angry. This wasn't simply a 'bad movie', I feel like it stepped over a personal boundary, my own human boundary and insulted me, and literally millions of other people that have to endure life's struggle as it's given to them. I watch this and I feel ashamed to only have to endure the hour and a half of this film, and that is the stark low point of my day. I feel ashamed to even afford a ticket to waste on this movie. It's watered down, inaccurate film-making at it's most manipulative point, and that is what makes me angry, not to mention Don Cheadle's embarrassing attempt to 'be African' while driving in carefully placed advertisements for Volkswagon. Really he is a just sheltered like the rest of us, a Hollywood movie star sucking in fat paychecks while there is real, not dramatized, suffering in the world just adds to the pain of watching the film. I saw 'Sometimes in April' recently and found this to be much more believable and affecting a film, I would recommend this well above 'Hotel Rwanda'. The realities are still out there, this is fantasy. I know this is harsh, but this film insults my intelligence as a film-goer and as a human being."
"There is no doubt that Hotel Rwanda is a brilliant and uplifting story; showing that what we (South) Africans call Ubuntu; caring for each other and assisting in anyway possible simply because we are all human and it is our fellow humans that make us who we are . I always liked Don Cheadle but his performance in Hotel Rwanda made it clear that he's one of the most underrated actors - The Brother is Brilliant! His performance in the movie is outstanding to say the least. He literally carries the movie on his shoulders. Sophie Okonedo (Cheadle's wife in the movie) gives a great performance. Nick Nolte and Joaquin Phoenix are also brilliant. There some brilliant visual moment in the movie, for instance when the UN trucks are ambushed when trying to transport Tutsi refugees for the time and when the military rescues the trucks the second time the mission is taken. There are brilliant shots and brilliant acting.However, I have a couple of concerns (to put it mildly) Well, I appreciate that I do not know or understand the reasons for the director and producer's decision to do and use methods that I'm about to question. However, as junior director in SA who hopes to be able to tell African stories to the world at some point, I'm very concerned. Firstly, the story is based in Rwanda however, South Africans make up what appears at least 70% of the cast that has dialogue/lines in the movie. This is of course great for Our industry as Our actors are getting exposure and experience. The problem however, is that they have South African accents when they are supposed to be Rwandan; Fana Mokoena (although his performance was great,) only remembered to have an accent towards the end of the movie - same goes for Desmond Dube! Yes an accent might not be a big deal but language is an important issue; it helps the local audience identify with the characters and gives the characters a sense of originality. Yes, the international audience might not be as aware of the differences between a South African and a Rwandan accent but South Africans and Rwandan's know and I feel that it is not fair to them (Rwandans). I don't understand why they couldn't use Rwandan actors&#8230;.There are one too many mistakes that again ruin the sense of originality, such as the use of English; it's used way too much! Yes this was made for an international audience but speaking from a Black South African's point of view whose first language is not English, there are times when you don't use it: when you've just been rescued from death by someone who understands your language, you'll thank them in that language! Especially with relatively old extras - I know for a fact that those in rural areas don't speak English to you if can understand their language they are more concerned about preserving languages that are being taken over by Western languagesWhat got me annoyed is that there's a scene featuring a red taxi in front of The Hotel and the taxi has a big yellow Alexandra (Johannesburg, SA) Taxi Association sticker on one of the windows - so what, do Rwandans have Alex taxis, we just didn't know about it?! What got me fuming are the names of the children displayed on boards at a refugee camp; Thabo, Buhle, etc. For crying out loud these are South African names! Again, someone from Canada might not know the difference but what does this imply to Rwandan's; that yes, this amazing story will be told but they'll be watered down as much as possible?!This annoys me because I believe that if one is to tell a story about a people, one has to do it right; in every sense of the word. What is the point of saying one is telling a South African Story then bring a whole American cast and props? I felt that I had to make an effort to convince myself that the story is based in Rwanda when watching the film because there are so many things that suggest otherwise. I guess this is another important sign (as in Amandla) that if we as Africans want our stories told and portrayed as real and true as possible, we have to do it ourselves.Having stated my concerns, I still say big ups to Terry George and the whole production team for telling this amazing story. And, absolutely Don Rocks!Asania Nkate Aphane Jozi"
"Just over ten years ago, Rwanda, a former Belgian colony the size of Vermont, became a horrific killing field, the result of ethnic, social, and political hatred between the majority Hutus and the rival Tutsis, the former ruling elite who ran the country for the Belgians and treated the Hutu as second class citizens. The Washington Post reported ""how the heads and limbs of victims were sorted and piled neatly, a bone-chilling order in the midst of chaos that harked back to the Holocaust."" The massacre that claimed over one million lives was triggered by the still unsolved assassination of Hutu President Juvenal Habyarimana, whose plane was gunned down by missiles on his return from a conference in Dar-es Salam. Senior Hutu leaders used the downing of the plane as an excuse to exterminate Tutsis and moderate Hutus. While the UN maintained a peacekeeping presence they did not intervene, nor did the U.S., France, Belgium or other Western powers who had the power to stop it.In the Oscar-nominated film Hotel Rwanda, the atrocity is dramatized through the story of the determination of one man who sheltered over 1000 Tutsis including his wife (Sophie Okenado), a Tutsi woman, and his children. Don Cheadle portrays hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina in a towering performance that earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Rusesabagina, who served as an adviser to the film, managed the Belgian-owned Hotel Mille Collines in the city of Kigali, a luxury hotel where UN dignitaries socialized with Western diplomats and media. As homes are invaded and bodies pile up, people are forced to leave their homes and seek shelter in churches, schools, and in this case the luxury hotel.As the sounds of fighting outside increase, the White guests are forced to leave and the remaining Africans are left to defend themselves with the token aid of the UN peacekeeping force, led by Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte), who is faced with an insurmountable task. With supplies of food and water diminishing and the violence increasing, Paul pleads with his guests to telephone the outside world in a plea for help but with scant results. The comment by an American journalist about the value of airing a segment explicitly showing Hutus hacking Tutsi civilians puts it into perspective: ""They will go  'O God, that's horrible!' and then go back to eating their dinner."" Hotel Rwanda allows us to see the conflict in human rather than political terms and Paul's loving relationship with his family is believable and deeply affecting. Though scenes of gory violence are kept to a minimum earning the film a PG-13 rating, the scene showing Paul and his assistant Gregoire driving through fog and discovering hundreds of bodies of slaughtered innocents lying on the road, stands out for its understated horror. Though not justifying the massacre, more historical background would have been helpful such as knowing the role of the Belgian colonial authority in fomenting ethnic division in the country, and the 1990 invasion of Rwanda by the exiled Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front with the support of the Americans and the British. While Hotel Rwanda may fall short of greatness, it is nonetheless a moving and powerful film, an unflinching indictment of the political extremism that fed the turmoil, the indifference of self-satisfied Western nations, and the courage and tenacity of one man who made a difference."
"""Hotel Rwanda"" is a docudrama which tells the true story of a hotel manager (Cheadle) who, at his own peril, provided safe haven and protection for about 1000 refugees fleeing the Rwandan genocide of 1994 when 800,000 people were killed in a three month civil war. As is often the case with films which are built around compelling subjects such as holocausts, the import of the subject rubs off on the film elevating it's importance. Such is the case with ""Hotel Rwanda"", which is well crafted though it offers nothing new, conforms to the Hollywood playbook, and is probably slightly over-touted. The film spares the audience much of the bloody horror of the genocide with its PG-13 rating while doing a good job of building suspense and imparting a sense of the magnitude of the slaughter of innocents. Didactics are worked into the story so it is not difficult to follow even though the good and bad people are all black Rwandans. Those interested in the 1994 Rwandan genocide might also want to check out ""Sometimes in April"", a 2005 TV drama about the genocide which offers a somewhat broader perspective. (B)"
"As governments around the world ignore the atrocities against the Sudanese in Darfur, this movie should have you screaming for something to be done to save them! 'The Hotel Rwanda' should be seen by all, and forgotten by none. 'The Hotel Rwanda' is a familiar favorite among Best Picture contenders, more than humbling an audience with biographical tales of heroic struggles against disgusting atrocities. 'The Pianist' and 'Schindler's List' are more recent examples of this. But, with 'The Hotel Rwanda,' the intensity delivered by director Terry George and the powerful performance by Don Cheadle as Paul Rusesabagina, this film was able to put the shock into people in a much more disturbing and intense way than I had ever seen any other movie do and leaves you silent and just as helpless long after you've left the theater.The Hotel Rwanda refers to the Belgium hotel that, under Rusesabagina's unexpected direction, served as a refugee camp for the Tutsi people who were being wiped out by Hutsi rebels in Rwanda. On the one hand, this movie shows you the kind of atrocities that could result if one faction controlled the media (the Hutsi's here controlled the radio waves and incited their violence and recruited their followers through a propaganda radio program). On the other hand, Rusesabagina is such an extraordinary heroic figure where he tried desperately to save people from the slaughter when it seems that every government that could help denied assistance to the Rwandas. Even where journalists were able to enter the country before the worst fighting began and report the massacre. We ought to be made aware of these things, and we should never ignore them, and never forget them.I am still amazed by the powerful emotion that this movie is able to invoke, to nearly lose your mind in desperation when it seems like there is going to be no hope left for Paul, his family, or the Rwandan refugees. To become nearly violent when anger when you their holocaust, but the other countries refuse to help.And, actress Sophie Okonedo, who plays Tatiana Rusesabagina, likewise gives an incredible performance as Paul's wife. This IS the Best Picture of 2004."
"Although I am not sure it was intended as such, this movie shows what George W. was thinking about when he decided to go it alone (so to speak) in Iraq. The UN is a toothless warrior. Its teeth have been removed by France and other nations that make money selling weapons to the people who commit the atrocities.Yes, I know we have been among those nations. That does not make it right.The West gave black nations technology and material goods. They never bothered teaching ethics or morality. Now these black nations are struggling to find a way to adapt to the world they have been dumped into without the benefit of an evolutionary educational process.A good movie."
"I almost didn't go see this movie. It's so hard for me to sit through things like this. It is very, very good, but you can only see it once if you have a heart or a soul. You can only go through the experience one time because you can't do it again, at least I can't. Don Cheadle was exceptional. Nick Nolte and Jaoquin Phoenix had very difficult roles. I was also happy to see Jean Reno has the hotel president. The good people anguished and the bad people schemed. The woman who played Don Cheadle's wife was also very good I really felt her fear. I agree with the critics that this movie had a message without being preachy. It should teach us a lesson, but I know the world won't listen."
"What do you feel about riots and mass killing? What did you do when you saw these things on news channels? Did you do anything to stop them? All that most of us would do is feel bad about it. And then we would turn off the TV sets, take dinner and go to sleep. The movie shows the attitude of the world when mass killing is being done in Africa in the communal riots between Hutus and Tutsis. The protagonist, ""Paul"", who is a Hutu himself, is just like one of us for whom his family (which is Tutsi) is the most important. In the beginning he would do anything to save his family and would not even bother about his good neighbour. But slowly as he sees what is going around him he starts to realize. He takes up the responsibility of giving shelter to thousands of refugees in his hotel. He keeps giving bribes to the Tutsis leader. He even speaks to so many influential people around the world. And although he had a lot of difficulties convincing the world powers that they should interrupt, he ends up saving lives of about 1200 people. It is not a feel good movie or anything like that. It is a true story about Survival and Will Power. If you liked Schindler's List, the this may be a notch above but not less. Buy it! http://www.schoolofsymphony.com"
"For a while now, there have been uprisings in Africa, most of the time, it is quite violent. In Tears of the Sun starring Bruce Willis, the problem in Nigeria was put into perspective. It was shown through the eyes of the US military trying to rescue a couple of select people but end up bringing back refugees. Hotel Rwanda takes a different path, shown through the eyes of those under attack.Hotel Rwanda is based on a true story out of Rwanda, Africa. It is a country gripped by war and oppression. When a four-star hotel is now thrown right into the mix of things, manager Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) has to make a very important decision. He must decide whether or not to let Tutsi's live in his hotel to take refuge from the Hutu soldiers.The problem is that the Hutu's, a tribe of Africans in Rwanda, are taking control and want to exterminate the Tutsis, a rival tribe. This hostile take over is one that spreads all over Paul's town. One night over a radio broadcast, the Hutu militia's leader told all of his soldiers to find and eliminate the Tutsis. Now, Paul, his wife Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo), who is a Tutsi, and their children must stay in the hotel and watch over all of the ""new guests"". With Paul paying off the leader of the Hutu militia, General Bizimungu, he tries to keep his hotel out of harms way.When he runs out of ideas and aid from the General and from the United Nations, led by Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte), and the media, he must defend his hotel by finding a way to get those refugees out of there and keep his family safe at the same time. Paul is faced with heart breaking decisions and must stay strong so he doesn't show weakness or give up the Tutsis.Cheadle's performance is breathtaking. When everything seems to be coming apart and he might lose it, he has to hold it together. Cheadle's character sees things that shouldn't be seen by anyone. So much death and destruction in one area can have an impact on a man. With scenes that are similar to Schindler's List, this movie is powerful and really shows how little people have known about the crisis in Rwanda.Hotel Rwanda was nominated for three Academy Awards for Best Actor (Cheadle), Best Supporting Actress (Okonedo), and Best Original Screenplay. Although it didn't win, the movies message was carried across and brought attention to the devastation in Africa.Hotel Rwanda is a masterpiece and is one of the most moving films of all time. It leaves nothing behind and shows you everything. It will be looked at for years to come. Hotel Rwanda opens will open your eyes."
"**** Don Cheadle, Nick Nolte, Jophie Okonedo, Hakeem Kae-Kazim, Desmond Dube, Joaquin Phoenix. Directed by Terry George.By far this is one of the best Biopics since Taylor Hackford did ""Ray"". The story is a Hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina (Cheadle, in his Oscar calibrated performance along with his acting in Assassination of Richard Nixon) keeps Tutsis refuges in his four star Hotel from the Hutu rebels on the outside.As he risks his life to save the lives of many, with the help of Nick Nolte whom as he helps Paul but also doesn't care. The movie shows that Cheadle is becoming one of our better actors and is rising up through the ranks to somewhere around Paul Giamatti caliber. Terry George the director/ writer with the aid of Keir Pearson do a fantastic job of recreating the havoc of 1994.""Hotel Rwanda"" is beautiful, inspiring and very compelling on Cheadle's performance. This is one of the year's best movies and one of the best I have ever see. Bravo!"
"I just finished watching Hotel Rwanda moments ago. It certainly didn't bore me. And I suppose I should say it was a good movie. But it's really just all part of that greater genre, the misery revolutions do to regular folks. It's something of a Doctor Zhivago in black skin. Still, it had it's contemporary twists. Like when the main character, an hotelier, informs the Hutu five-star general that although the Americans and Europeans may have left for now, they certainly have his name on their list as a war criminal for judgment later. ""That's how these people operate,"" he says. True enough.You should probably give it a squint. But I don't get the premise that the whites are somehow responsible for not stopping the bloodshed. Didn't colonization end a long time ago? Aren't these people responsible for managing their own fate now? And if not, then are we obligated morally to renew occupation? These questions, of course, are not explored.But the end titles do tell us that the hotelier is now happilly living with his extended family in Brussells. When the colonizers leave the colonized want to go with them. And who could blame them. Sub-Saharan Africa, as ever it has, sucks."
