"12 Years a Slave tells the true story of Solomon Northup, an educated and free black man living in New York during the 1840's who gets abducted, shipped to the south, and sold into slavery. It is a film that stimulates at both an emotional level and an intellectual one. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Solomon Northup. He's been a ""that guy"" actor for sometime – film-goers may know his face but not his name. After this film his name will be known. He gives, quite simply, the best performance from a leading actor since Daniel Day Lewis in There Will Be Blood. Because of his character's position as a slave he is usually unable to speak his mind unless he is prepared to be beaten. As a result Ejiofor is forced to utilize body language and his eyes, which become enormous pools of emotion to express himself to the audience. He's forced to endure terrible things, but he always maintains a certain dignity and nobility that makes his plight even more affecting. It's a performance of incredible subtlety that may leave you speechless and in complete awe.Micheal Fassbender gives the best performance of his already extremely impressive career, even besting his previous high marks from the films Shame and Hunger (both directed by Steve McQueen, who also directed 12 Years a Slave). He plays Edwynn Epps, a vicious and demonic slaver and perhaps the most loathsome and disgusting character ever put on screen. If alive today, he'd likely be a drunk with severe anger management issues. By turns pathetic and terrifying, he embodies the ultimate nightmare of a deeply flawed man given absolute power over other human beings, and through that absolute power finds only madness, which drives him to deeper cruelty. He's always a menacing and malignant presence even when not on screen, as his slaves must always be aware and prepared for his seemingly random bouts of sadism. Other actors give excellent performances as well. Paul Giamatti, Paul Dano, Benedict Cumberbatch, Sarah Paulson, Alfre Woodard are all great in relatively small roles. But in this film of titans it's the one you've probably never heard of who perhaps stands above them all. In her first role in a feature film, Lupita Nyong'o, playing the pretty young slave Patsey - the object of Edwynn Epps demented and horrifying affections and the emotional epicenter of the entire picture, gives one of the most devastating performances I have ever seen. A portrait of unbearable sadness, her character is a mirror image of Solomon. While Solomon is a man who refuses to break and give up the dignity which he's known since birth, she is one who has long since been broken, and who never knew dignity in the first place. Her life is a living hell, forced to endure the ""love"" of Edwyn Epps and the brutal jealousy of his wife, she's trapped in a terrible triangle that she can't escape. Despite that, she retains a level of innocence that only heightens the tragedy of her character. It actually gets to the point where simply looking at this character might be enough to bring you to tears. It's a shattering performance.Starting his career as a video artist before making full length films, Steve McQueen has an uncanny eye for imagery and contrast. He's also a very patient film maker, utilizing long, steady single shots to emphasize various things. In his prior films this has felt like a purely stylistic choice, here, it's a choice aimed directly at our heart. When the events on screen become their most horrifying and ugly is when his camera becomes the most unflinching. At times feeling perhaps like we're seeing out of the solemn eyes of the ghost of some murdered slave, watching in sorrow and rage. This is both McQueen's most accessible and artistically searing film yet. There are also moments of stunning natural beauty that would make Terrence Malick proud. Alone, these shots would inspire wonder, but in the context of this film they make us feel more forlorn, as if the ugliness of man is encroaching on the natural beauty of the world.Perhaps the most noteworthy thing about 12 Years a Slave is the way that it portrays slavery itself. Instead of taking the easy way out and limiting his exploration of the topic solely to the slaves, Steve McQueen increases the scope and we see how it affects those who profited by it. Take Benedict Cumberbatch's character. A seemingly decent and caring man who treats his slaves with some semblance of respect and kindness. He comes off as a relatively good man who is trapped within the powerful confines of the institution of slavery. In 12 Years a Slave, slavery is shown as a horrifying and destructive social construct that drains the humanity from everyone it touches, turning good men into moral quandaries, turning flawed men into monsters, and turning an entire race of people into livestock and tools. To watch 12 Years a Slave is to be confronted with the grim reality of slavery in a way that's never been done before. To say this is the best film ever made about slavery feels trivial, as slavery is a subject in film that has been shown with naive romanticism from films like Gone With the Wind or silly exploitation from something like Django Unchained. Both of which serve to make the topic digestible. To watch 12 Years a Slave is to experience a level of despair and misery that can become overwhelming. It's a film of such ugliness, such blunt emotional trauma, that it may haunt you for hours if not days after seeing it. So why should you watch a film that could leave you reeling and devastated? Because, it's also one of the greatest cinematic achievements of our time."
"chitchens fan  2 hours ago △ ▽ − Well, to begin, I cannot remember the last time I could not get up at the end of a movie. I literally could not rise up from my seat. My body felt as though it were being weighed down by something considerably larger and heavier than myself... History had it's way with me( I am an African American woman). Thank you Mr. McQueen, Mr. Ejiofor, Ms. Nyong'o, Ms. Paulson and others, and yes, even Mr. Fassbender. I am not a film critic nor a movie hobbyist, although I try to stay current, but what I am is a human being trying to understand the various problems and issues within our country. This movie is a potent reminder of why we are where we are as a society today. How man can be so unflinchingly cruel to his fellow man, especially if he looks, speaks or behaves differently, I will never understand."
"A random and encounter has led Solomon Northup from living freely in New York to being kidnapped and sold into slavery in Louisiana, getting handed over to various slave owners. There, Solomon witnesses numerous acts of cruelty that no man should ever face.As I stared at the movie screen with full dread, I was reeling back at certain scenes I had just witnessed. There were good films and television shows about slavery before, and they had various nuances at how to tackle slavery. This film is part of said resurgence of the sub- genre, hot on the heels of ""Django Unchained"" and ""The Butler"". But while the former relinquishes on Spaghetti Western entertainment more than attempting to address the issue in a political light as the latter, Steve McQueen's ""12 Years a Slave"" shuts those two up, and perhaps the entire sub-genre, for good. I doubt any future slavery-themed film will be as harrowing as this one was.Steve McQueen is a fearless filmmaker, continuing his streak of unfiltered brutality within human depths. He frames his actors' faces in extreme close-up, the eyes staring into despair, the nostrils fuming in aggression. Naked flesh are shown not because of erotic content, but rather because of desperation and futility. Long takes and wide shots are not uncommon in his films, and here they showcase a plethora of fantastic scenes and performances that work to discomfort the viewer as much as possible. McQueen doesn't just allow the audience to tackle slavery, he guts the audience and leaves them for the consequences. This is an extremely uncomfortable film to watch. Beautifully shot locations are placeholders for unsettling sequences before and after, contemplated by Hans Zimmer's poignant and at times horrifying score. This all works to create a nightmarish time and place where hell walks on Earth.Central to all of this is the performance of Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon. Ejiofor showcases that he is a natural force to be reckoned with in this film, after a decade of mostly supporting characters. He spaces out in despair as the camera lingers onto him for solid minutes, not a word spoken. Another sequence shows him mourning the death of a fellow worker, in which the singing of the surrounding group compels him and shakes him down to tears. These scenes follow earlier ones where he is a classy, free man in the upper states, mingling happily with the crowd and partaking in fanciful music sessions. It is a tour-de-force performance.A fine ensemble of established and up-and-coming actors surround Ejiofor in his limelight - Paul Dano, Paul Giammati, Alfre Woodard, Sarah Paulson, even Brad Pitt and Benedict Cumberbatch, but none so ferociously as McQueen regular Michael Fassbender as the despicable, sadistic plantation owner Edwin Epps. So excellent and terrifying is Fassbender's portrayal of such a merciless and barbaric person, that the mere sight of him will either cause audience members unfamiliar to him to flinch.I was left speechless as the credits rolled. A lesser film would have added tacked-on sentimentality/exaggeration and politically influenced claptrap. Not this one. This is a movie to watch as a reminder of how powerful the human spirit can endeavor, and how lucky all of us have grown past that dreadful time in history. The full effect of it has not been felt in movies before, until now."
"I attended the premiere of 12 Years a Slave at the Toronto International Film Festival. Having no tickets, we had to wait close to 4 hours hoping they might let us in. I have to say it was definitely worth the wait and it is hands down the best film I've seen at the festival. The film is based on the real story of Solomon Northup (played by Chiwetel Ejiofor), a free black man living in New York, who is abducted and sold into slavery in Louisiana. As the film begins, we are exposed to his talent as a musician (he plays the violin) and get a glimpse of the life he leads with his wife and two children. All is well until he meets two men who seem taken by his music and want to bring him along with them so he can play at various events. When Solomon wakes up in chains, his dark journey starts and the film never lets you take a break.If you've seen McQueen's other works then you more or less know what kind of movie to expect (if you haven't then please stop reading and watch Hunger and Shame). 12 Years a Slave is dark and raw, it exposes everything, without sugarcoating it. It is definitely hard to watch; Several people walked out of the the theatre but in my opinion, it is not only worth watching but necessary. Films exploring themes of slavery are few and far in between and never has one been quite as exhaustive and effective as this one. Beautifully shot and edited, the film features moments of tension, heartbreak and a few laughs here and there. Steve McQueen has created another masterpiece.Most actors get very little screen time. Paul Giamatti and Sarah Paulson are seen for a few minutes but both are great as usual. Benedict Cumberbatch plays a plantation owner, who recognizes Solomon's talent and tries to help him to a certain extent. Despite being a slaver, he is presented in the film as being a good man. Cumberbatch was very good, though outshined by far by Michael Fassbender. He goes through every emotion and gives it his everything. In my opinion, this is his best performance to date. Paul Dano gets a few minutes of screen time as well but makes incredible use of it. As Benedict's worker, he despises slaves and the songs he sings to Solomon makes an incredibly powerful scene, one of the most disturbing in the film. Lupita Nyong'o's first appearance in a feature film is stunning, as she plays a heart breaking young slave. I hope she has a long career ahead of her, she certainly has the talent for it. The true star is definitely Chiwetel Ejiofor. His performance as Solomon is stunning and unforgettable, I truly hope he wins the Oscar for it this year.All in all, if you get a chance to see 12 Years a Slave, don't miss it. Not everyone will be able to stomach it but it's an outstanding film that deserves and needs to be seen."
"Read More @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)One of the things that have been thrown around for months now is the notion that awards season voting bodies won't respond to it because it's too ""difficult"" to sit through. Let's define difficult, shall we? Is it difficult to see the first openly gay politician gunned down by his closeted colleague? Is it difficult to see a reformed convict put to death by our country for his crimes? Is it difficult to see a mother choose which one of her children dies during the Holocaust? I'd argue that these answers add up to a resounding yes. Yet, no one threw those phrases of ""too difficult"" around.I've watched hundreds of films throughout my short 29-year history and I've seen some difficult cinema. Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" can make anyone quiver in shame as it shows the despicable reality of the Holocaust. Paul Greengrass' ""United 93"", which is almost an emotional biopic of America's darkest hour, makes me want to crawl up into a ball and cry. And finally, Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"", one of the highest grossing films of all-time, shows the labor of our sins fleshed out into the beaten skin of an honest man. And still, no one threw these hyperbolic terms out saying, ""it's too hard watch."" Is it because this is an American tragedy, done by Americans? Is it the guilt of someone's ancestors manifesting it in your tear ducts? I can't answer that. Only the person who says it can. The structure of this country is built on the backs and blood of slaves. But slavery didn't just exist in America, it was everywhere. It was horrifying what occurred for over 200 years and believe it or not, still exists in some parts of the world TODAY.Now when approaching the powerful film by McQueen and distributed by Fox Searchlight Pictures, there is a resounding honesty that McQueen and screenwriter John Ridley inhabit. There are no tricks or gimmicks, no cheap takes on a side story or character that is put there for time filling or a life-lesson for Solomon to learn. Everything is genuine. Is the film heartbreaking? Oh my God yes. Did I cry for several minutes after the screening? Embarrassingly so. I was enamored the entire time, head to toe, moment to moment.I have long admired the talent that's been evident in the works of Chiwetel Ejiofor. I've known he was capable of what he has accomplished as Solomon Northup and he hits it out of the park. He has the urgency, worry, and drive to get home to his family and executes every emotion flawlessly even when all hope seems to be lost. Where he shines incredibly are the small nuances that he takes as the story slows down, you notice aspects of Solomon that make him even more believable.As Edwin Epps, Solomon's last owner, Michael Fassbender digs down deep into some evil territory. Acts as the ""Amon Goeth"" of our tale, he is exactly what you'd expect a person who believes this should be a way of life to behave. He's vile and strikes fear into not only the people he interacts with but with the viewers who watch. As Mrs. Epps, Sarah Paulson is just as wretched. Abusive, conniving, entitled, and I loved every second of her.Mark my words; Lupita Nyong'o is the emotional epicenter of the entire film. The heartache, tears, and anger that will grow inside during the feature will have our beautiful ""Patsey"" at the core. She is the great find of our film year and will surely go on to more dynamic and passionate projects in the future. You're watching the birth of a star.Hans Zimmer puts forth a very pronounced score, enriched with all the subtle ticks that strike the chords of tone. One thing that cannot be denied is the exquisite camera work of Sean Bobbit. Weaving through the parts of boat and then through the grassroots of a cotton field, he puts himself in the leagues of Roger Deakins and Seamus McGarvey as one of the most innovative and exciting DP's in the business. Especially following his work in ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" earlier this year. Simply marvelous.Oscar chances, since I know many of you are wondering. Put the Oscar's in my hands, you have a dozen nominations reap for the taking. Best Picture, Director, Lead Actor, Supporting Actor, dual Supporting Actresses, Adapted Screenplay, Production Design, Cinematography, Costume Design, Film Editing, Makeup and Hairstyling, Original Score. There's also a strong and rich sound scope that is present. The sounds of nature as the slaves walk or as Solomon approaches his master's house is noticed. The big question is, can it win? I haven't seen everything yet so I cannot yet if it deserves it or not. I can say, if critics and audiences can get off this ""difficult"" watch nonsense and accept the cinematic endeavor as a look into our own history as told from a great auteur, there's no reason it can't top the night. I'm very aware that seeing this film along with Steve McQueen crowned by Oscar is nearly erasing 85 years of history in the Academy. Are they willing and ready to begin looking into new realms and allowing someone not necessarily in their inner circles to make a bold statement as McQueen and Ridley take in ""12 Years a Slave?"" I remain hopeful."
"Director Steve McQueen has gathered a talented cast, a compelling plot idea, and a wonderful cinematographer and then snuffed the life from them with his clinical, detached directing style that robs what should be the most affecting movie of the year and turns it into a plodding, emotionless, historical biopic.Despite the valiant efforts of Chiwetel Ejiofor and especially newcomer Lupta Nyong'o, this drama about a musician who is duped, drugged and sold into slavery never manages to find an emotional chord.Like last year's Oscar-bait, ""Les Miserables,"" the film is often told in long, steady pan shots or a continuous array of distracting close-ups of actors filled with angst or anger. And the film finds no rhythm in its editing to make these extremes work. Even the most harrowing scenes in ""12 Years,"" and there a plenty of them to choose from, lack dramatic tension. One may as well be watching an accident filmed on a surveillance camera on the local news, because that's how detached McQueen's film style is (which also killed his over-praised ""Shame,"" for me as well.)Some have likened ""12 Years a Slave"" to ""Schindler's List,"" but for emotional wallop, there is no comparison. ""Schindler's List"" is in every way, from script to score, the vastly superior movie: not only shocking but truly emotional and with actual drama.John Ridley's screenplay has a few fine dynamics, but quite frankly in the end all the characters in the film end up being (literally) too black or white. Even the few characters (like Benedict Cumberbatch's Ford or Garrett Dillahunt's Armsby) who seem to have shades of gray, of course turn out to be turn-coats. Michael Fassbender and Sarah Paulson get two roles that feature them being evil incarnate, to the point you expect Fassbender to twirl his mustache at times. But again, any kind of shading the actors may have tried to play gets lost with McQueen's endless habit of sticking the camera repeatedly into the actor's faces.""12 Years"" is by no means an awful movie, but I think hype surrounding it in the press will lead to disappointment in movie goers who are expecting an amazing visceral tale, and are deceived into getting a stagnant and clinical examination of some of the darkest days of American history. Members of the audience I saw the movie with began talking half-way through and some people were overheard saying, ""How can they make this subject so dull?"" as they headed for the exit."
"I just saw this at LFF. It is a brilliant piece of cinema. Clearly it's central theme is slavery, and the depravity human nature can so easily reach; but it has many other small moments that trigger thoughts about wider issues - the role of religion being one for example. It is violent, and in some respects awful to watch, but this is the story of Solomon Northup told truthfully. There is nothing saccharine about the way Steve McQueen presents this and that is what makes it so astonishing. You cry because what you witness is truly terrible, not because the violins are out and the director's tugging on your heart strings. All the acting is first rate, as is the score by Hans Zimmer. This really should be essential viewing for everyone old enough to understand it."
"12 Years A Slave is nominated for all the awards and talked about with huge praise. Well sorry, but having just seen it, I have to disagree. It's 2hrs 13mins of hardship.We have seen powerful films in the past that have dealt with injustice and suffering, films like Schindler's List, The Color Purple, The Killing Fields etc., but all these have managed to get across the horror and suffering whilst keeping me engaged. Unfortunately, 12 Years was just suffering.I felt the film really dragged. Much has been written about how Steve McQueen is very brave to hold shots for a long time. The film is littered with shots that linger for an age while little or nothing happens and I say that if you notice that a shot is long then it's too long and doesn't work. Surely if this was a good thing you wouldn't notice it. I noticed it, and noticed it and noticed it.I was so pleased when Brad Pitt showed up, not just because he is always good to watch but his role is that of a saviour and believe me, at that point the film needed a saviour. He has a line that sums up the film ""Yours is an amazing story but not one point of it is good"".The final scene really killed it for me. This man has been away 12 years and when he meets his family does he run crying into their arms? No. Does he whoop, laugh and shout with joy? No. He sadly stands and meekly asks their forgiveness for his shabby appearance. Arghhhhh! I cry at movies. I am an embarrassment as I cry that easily. Guess what? Not a tear. For a movie that deals with the horror of slavery that's a terrible thing."
"Solomon Northup suffered many degradations after being unlawfully forced into slavery in the American Deep South during the 1840s and 50s. He contributed to a ghost written book detailing his tragic experiences. This movie is based on that book.The film is relentless in its depiction of the despicable white men and women that Soloman (renamed Platt Hamilton by his new 'owners') encounters as a slave. There is absolutely no let up. This does a disservice to Mr Northup's account of his tale. By his own account, William Ford was a decent man, though a product of the time he lived in, and his background. He was not portrayed as such in the movie - I'm guessing because this did not fit the screenwriter/directors literal black and white vision of his tribulations. Thelma and Louise suffered from the same type of problem, in it's depiction of 'all men are bastards' proclamation.I got bored after a half hour or so. Which should not have happened. It's a terrible story, filled with deeply tragic events. But I found myself, moving from... Jeez, that's terrible. The poor man.....to Oh God love her. That's unforgivable.... to I am so glad I was not born black in America during slavery... to OK, I get it. There weren't many sympathetic white people... to Sheesh, was EVERY white person SO irredeemably vicious? to Alright, ALREADY...I get it..White people treated black people worse than animals!! to Oh FFS, how was this written? With crayons? I also found myself thinking of Alex Haley's Roots. This told a not dissimilar story of enforced slavery on black people in America. But there was dark and light in the story. You rooted for the characters. You understood that the black slaves were quite often better people, all round, than their white owners. But you weren't beaten over the head with that thought.12 Years's depiction of Salomon and his companions existence did not let up for one second. I don't mean to underplay the hardships that they endured, which were terrible. But the relentless depiction of all of the black people as nothing other than victims reduced them to caricature.Just like a good horror movie will have light moments, which both relieve the tension and then make the horror more shocking, it would, for me, have been better served to show moments of light relief which were then snatched away by, for example, the loathsome Edwin Epps. In this way, we can better identify with Salomon's plight. But the incessant misery becomes almost expected after numerous representations, to the point where it ceases to shock. And that's what's wrong with the movie, for me. Something has gone seriously wrong when the depiction of merciless hardships by fellow human beings becomes boring. And I was bored. Not helped by too many lingering closeups, some extending to thirty seconds. The director is obviously a fan of Kurosowa.The actors were all excellent, especially the lead character. It looked beautiful. And I will read the book now, where before I hadn't heard of it. But the movie didn't work for me. A good story badly told."
"Considering the social and economic importance of slavery in America's history, the scarcity of serious films depicting the daily life of slaves in the Confederate States is significant - especially since the after-effects from this shameful episode still echo through the culture. '12 Years a Slave' is based upon the memoirs of Solomon Northup, who endured a hellish period of enslavement in Louisiana, which is backed up by legal records.The story begins with him living with wife and children in upstate New York as a free man and respected member of his community. After being lured to Washington by a couple of con-artists who promised him work, he was subsequently drugged, locked in chains, viciously beaten, stripped of his identity and shipped to New Orleans to be sold into slavery. Over the next twelve years, he was owned by two men who treated him in contrasting ways. The first was a relatively civilized fellow, but the plantation's half-witted manager was threatened by Northup's superior intelligence. Their mutual dislike produced a dangerously volatile situation, and unwilling to lose his investment, Northup's owner re-sold him to a neighbor. This unbalanced individual regarded his slaves as property to be used for pleasure and profit, which caused them to live in perpetual fear that his capricious moods would flare into sadistic lust or rage at any moment.It's noteworthy that a British director has become one of the few filmmakers to delve deeply into this subject, and the combination of John Ridley's powerful script and McQueen's directorial skills has inspired exceptional performances from the entire cast. Their dramatization of Northup's experiences is both riveting and uncomfortable to watch, as the film depicts the perverse nature of a society that permitted such a barbaric system. Hopefully it will reach a large US audience, who will learn how a privileged Southern elite cruelly exploited their fellow humans in order to acquire greater wealth for themselves."
"Once again Hollywood waves its sanctimonious wand over history with this glossy movie about slavery in the United States. Like a self-righteous teetotaler telling off an alcoholic, it is a sentimental, holier-than-thou piece that challenges you to criticize it or 'you're a racist too'. Following in the footsteps of Django it uses the excuse of history and a worthy theme to justify gratuitous scenes of violence. The film begins in the home of the central character, Solomon Northop, a free black man, who lives a genteel life with his family in New York. The director is clearly eager to get to the gory bits though, and within the first ten minutes Solomon has been kidnapped, enslaved, and the audience is cringing under a close up of his contorted face during a twenty minute whipping scene; the first of many to come. The film continues in this vein, as we follow Solomon's journey through an array of increasingly evil slave-owners. There is a segregation of personality in the film, with most of the black characters being good and moral and the white ones evil. Surely it is as patronizing and insulting to assume personality is dependent on colour as it is politically correct. At least the same cannot be said of gender, the white women are as evil as their male counterparts. However no film about slavery is complete without our token good white guy, and Brad Pitts rises to the occasion, strolling in bearded and ready to play, once again, the hero.One does wonder why Solomon doesn't send a letter under his 'mistress'name on one of his frequent forays to the shop. (Of course, his one attempt to run away is thwarted when after two steps he stumbles on a lynching scene). Perhaps the point the director is trying to make is that Solomon is too broken and scared to do this. He is too proud, however, to pick the cotton quota demanded by the sadistic slave-owner. A necessary contradiction perhaps, as this allows more whipping scenes as he is punished daily.Or why, instead of trying and failing to write a letter with a blunt bamboo stick and watery juice, he doesn't simply use the candle end and stain the paper instead. But it is not a film for the details. Nor the historical overview.It is two hours of increasing brutality, culminating with a horrendous scene where one girl is whipped until her flesh is exposed. Instead of taking one of the many examples of modern day slavery however, which could leave people feeling guilty at inaction, it is set far enough in the past that it allows the audience to do their cinema time, and leave feeling as worthy and sanctimonious as the director."
"I was hoping to really enjoy ""12 Years a Slave"" but wasn't expecting a 2 hr long movie of very long, ponderous slow camera shots of nature and hardly any compelling dialog or character development. This was then broken up seemingly every 10 minutes by a savage flogging or a vicious rape or some other sadistic cruelty being inflicted on the movie's hero, the hapless Solomon a freeman sold into slavery, and the other slaves. Except for Brad Pitt's Canadian abolitionist and a gentleman from Solomon's home town, virtually every white character in this movie is portrayed as the very embodiment of evil. No nuance, nothing but unremitting sadism.A lot of people seem to be comparing this movie to ""Schindler's List"" although I can't understand why. In ""List"" you had the compelling story of Schindler who, for reasons known only to himself, risks his life to save as many Jews as he can. The Jewish prisoners are depicted as full characters, people you know and care about. Even the Nazi played by Ralph Finnes is given some depth, a man whose cruelty has been unleashed and sanctioned by his Nazi bosses but, you suspect but for the war would be a man who might be interesting to be around---a lover of fine food, good wine and a roving eye for the women. But the slave masters in ""12 Years a Slave"" don't have the slightest hint of anything human about them, just treating people with cruelty for cruelty's sake.If filmmakers really wanted to make a powerful movie about slavery, they might consider boldly making a new version of ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" and hew closely to the story that Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote. It's a powerful book and it gets far deeper into the immorality of slavery than anything like ""12 Years a Slave"" does. The memoirs that ""12"" was based on came out soon after the huge success of ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"". The opening scene of the slave-traders benignly discussing their ""wares"" in ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" was so chilling to read that I couldn't even bear to read it through in one sitting. ""12"" had a similar scene with the excellent Paul Giamatti as a slave-trader, but the movie never got any deeper."
"Directed by Steve McQueen and staring Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender, Benedict CUmberbatch, newcomer Lupita Nyong'o, and a ton of other stars, '12 Years a Slave' is based on the memoir of Solomon Northup, a freeman who was living in Saratoga, NY before being tricked, drugged, and sold into slavery in the south.McQueen is an auteur known for his honest and brutal direction, and he keeps filming when others would shut the camera off or look away. While making the picture that much more difficult to sit through, his steadfastness greatly elevates the emotional impact of the film. It's a must-see, if only for educational purposes—just as 'Schindler's List' is used to teach about the Holocaust and 'Milk' about the struggle for gay rights. I'm not trying to compare the events depicted in this film with the events depicted in those I just mentioned, all I'm saying is that they are all equally important in portraying the reality of their respective situations. There is a moment in '12 Years a Slave' when, as a form of punishment, Northup is hanged by his neck, the tips of his toes just able to reach the ground below him. The camera stays on him for a few minutes. It is silent, and all you can do is listen to him struggling for breath. This is one of the more disturbing moments in the film, but not the worst. Eventually, Northup is sold to Edwin Epps, a short-tempered and impulsive plantation owner portrayed by Michael Fassbender. He is by far the most villainous and terrifying character in the film, and Fassbender brilliantly captures his mood swings and tempestuous personality. It is Chiwetel Ejiofor, however, who steals the show. He brings so much life to Northup, and completely disappears into his characters. He is able to depict so many deep levels of emotion, while also bringing dignity to a man who was unwilling to let anyone take away his will to ""live"" rather than just ""survive."" Additionally, Lupita Nyong'o, in her first big film role, is mesmerizing as Patsey, and hardworking and desperate woman, and the object of her master Epps's attention. She is hated by Epps's wife—masterfully played by Sarah Paulson— and most of the more dramatic moments in the film revolve around her character's tragic story. If I have one complaint, it's that 12 years do not seem to pass by at all, mainly because none of the characters substantially age. Also, Brad Pitt is thrown in for ten minutes to depict a kind-hearted abolitionist, and while he does a good job, it just feels like Brad Pitt on a slave plantation, which is totally out of place. Regardless, while the film may be harrowing and difficult to sit through, it is simply brilliant all the way through, and by far the most honest depiction of slavery that I've ever seen."
"12 Years a Slave — a biopic about a black fiddler in NY who somehow wound up a slave in Louisiana from 1841 until the law rescued him in 1853—is the nearly universally acclaimed front runner for the Best Picture Oscar. Yet it's built upon a fourth-rate screenplay that might have embarrassed Horatio Alger.12 Years a Slave is hailed by critics as a long-awaited breakthrough that finally dares to mention the subject of slavery after decades of the entertainment industry being controlled by the South.The message behind the ongoing enshrinement of the rather amateurish 12 Years a Slave is that the cultural whippings of white folk for the sins of their long dead ancestors will stubbornly continue on until morale improves. The formula: Stoke it, package it, market it.Steve McQueen directs the film in a sort of minor league Passion of the Christ manner. Some of the appeal to critics is that Northern whites are shown as saints of racial sensitivity in the film's preposterous first 20 minutes.12 Years a Slave opens in 1841 with Northup being effusively admired by his white neighbors in Saratoga, NY. Northup is a model of ridiculous bourgeois respectability, always doffing his top hat to his white peers while out riding with his family in an elegant carriage.How could he afford that? Well, actually, he didn't and couldn't. A glance at Northup's ghostwritten 1853 memoir makes clear that in 1841, rather than being a pillar of this Yankee community, he was an unemployed fiddler dragged down by his own ""shiftlessness.""In McQueen's often baffling movie, this respectable family man suddenly decides to run off to join the circus with two fast-talking white men without even leaving a note for his wife. Later, while dining in an elegant Washington, DC restaurant with his new friends, he suddenly takes ill and wakes up in chains.Ironically, his poor family never reported or even guessed that he'd been kidnapped. They apparently assumed that vanishing was just the kind of thing he'd do.When word of his kidnapping finally arrived home in 1853, top officials in both NY and Louisiana were dismayed by the trick played upon this freeborn citizen and worked together to quickly have him released.Interestingly, it was widely believed that Northup had conspired with his white cronies to defraud slave owners of their purchase price by attempting to pull a con on them. Reminiscent of the 1971 comedy Skin Game, starring James Garner and Louis Gossett, Jr. as traveling grifters in 1858 where Garner repeatedly sells Gossett into slavery and then helps him escape.Northup's hometown newspaper, the Saratoga Press, surmised that Northup had been an accomplice in a scam gone awry:""it is more than suspected that Northup was an accomplice in the sale, calculating to slip away and share the spoils, but that the purchaser was too sharp for him, and instead of getting the cash, he got something else.""This theory that Northup was a man of dubious character rather than the tediously upright one depicted in the movie might explain another puzzling aspect of his tale: how little help he got from his fellow slaves. In general, the other slaves as display remarkably little human warmth toward Northup. They mostly act completely indifferent whenever he is around.When Northup finally arrived home, an abolitionist politician hired David Wilson to be his ghostwriter. Wilson wrote Northup's story in his own style, and they hit it big in the slave-narrative craze that followed the 1852 publication of Uncle Tom's Cabin. Not many were sold, but more than enough to launch Northup on the abolitionist lecture circuit.Predictably, Northup disappeared from history four years later. Those who knew him best seem to have assumed that he had become a ""worthless vagabond,"" as his wife's obituary bluntly phrased it. Almost all of this is left out of the movie as being far too interesting for Oscar Bait.I suppose Third-rate Victorian literature such as Wilson's version of Northup's memoir is tolerable today if the author understands his limitations. Most of the first-person narration is thankfully utilitarian. Only occasionally does Wilson have Northup reminisce in the grand Victorian manner: ""Now had I approached within the shadow of the cloud, into the thick darkness whereof I was soon to disappear, thenceforward to be hidden from the eyes of all my kindred, and shut out from the sweet light of liberty, for many a weary year.""Indeed, on the rare occasions when Wilson quotes Northup's utterances, the slave speaks in a more plausible fashion, such as, ""There is nobody I want to write to, 'cause I ain't got no friends living as I know of.""Unfortunately, Ridley's adaptation takes its inspiration for its made-up dialog from the worst prose in the book. Since it would be racist for Ridley to show slaves ending their sentences with prepositions, they instead orate pompous speeches toward each other, like Prime Minister Gladstone addressing Queen Victoria. As the hero, Ejiofor labors to bring life to these lines, with indifferent, if not comical success.Hollywood has been waving its celluloid wand over history since its inception. Unfortunately, studio contrived ""reality"" usually wins the emotional battle over the truth --even for those with more than a tenuous understanding of the world around them. It's all part of the ongoing, and successful campaign keep all critical theory groups in their respective consensus trances; instilling grievance focused identities in blacks, and derivative guilt syndrome in whites. I suppose once all the altruistic white people who fall for sympathetic pleas of universal equality have been eliminated via natural selection, blacks will spontaneously adopt their innate, but perpetually oppressed Western sensibilities and go on to build flourishing, first world Utopias? Coming soon to a theater near you!"
"I'm really going to be the exception here and pan this film. I was no non-plussed about it that I can barely be bothered to review it properly. The amount of dead space (for example a 75 second scene showing Soloman just looking at the scenery) was astonishing - any other director would have dealt with the subject matter in about 30 minutes. Both my girlfriend and I were close to walking out with the boredom.But we didn't because we were expecting the stage to be set for a finale whereby through complex legal machinations, the injustice is uncovered and Soloman is reunited with his family. So what complex genius might effect his release? He writes a letter to a friend! A LETTER! Genius - amazed he could devise such a complex solution given a mere 12 years! So once reunited, will we be treated to the legal wranglings to ensure this can't happen again and that those responsible are brought to justice? Nope.So, basically, man gets kidnapped, lives as a slave working for three different ""Masters"", witnesses hard work and unfair treatment of slaves including murder and rape, and eventually gets to go home after writing a letter to a friend who comes and picks him up. Hardly noteworthy at all, and in my worst five films of all time."
"Where to begin? OK, by stating the simple facts. The history here is distorted beyond all measure. 21st century sensibilities, seen through the lens of sterilized political correctness, make this film practically unwatchable from beginning to the (oh will it ever come?) end. Every white character is a one dimensional pastiche of evil while, conversely, it's only black people who possess anything approaching morality and basic human decency. It wears out and wears thin very rapidly indeed.Steve McQueen - a director whose previous work I admired - got this film all wrong. He needed to do many things to put this film on the right track from the get go. But, most of all, he needed to work with a script which had its roots in reality, not in this distorted, oddly perverse and, frankly, unworthy representation of antebellum America. It's a shame and a sham yet it could have been a great story. Truly awful, but I gave it 2 stars - the extra one because, thank heavens, Oprah is not in it."
"Let me start off by saying that I like a good movie based on a true story like Schindler's List, The Butler, A Beautiful Mind, We Bought A Zoo, etc., etc. I'm also fully aware that not all events will be entirely factual so when I went into this movie I wasn't going in expecting accuracy in any form. What I did go in expecting was a good performance by great actors and I must say the acting was fantastic, but unfortunately the rest of the film was a complete train wreck. I felt it had potential at first and then that feeling quickly dissipated after watching the first beating commence and continued to diminish after seeing the attempted hanging where he walked around on his toes for at least a good twenty to thirty seconds and we had to sit and watch. I didn't think it was possible for the movie to get more boring but then they threw in yet another thirty second scene where we all proceeded to stare at the main character's face while he sat idle, occasionally moving his head from side to side. I wanted to feel emotion for these poor characters but every emotion that I had was quickly ruined by incredibly long, drawn out, and unnecessary scenes. Not only did I have to sit through the agonizing, stretched out scenes but whenever there was about to be a significant lapse of time within the main character's life they'd add in a bonus five to seven seconds where we stared at a bunch of trees. I'd like to say that I was moved by the movie or felt some sort of enjoyment in watching it but in truth the only touching moment I truly had was at the end of the film when I realized it was FINALLY over. I'd liken it's boringness to The Fifth Estate but honestly it was far worse. My advice to you would be to ignore the plethora of ten star reviews and think twice before you decide to pick it up for movie rental once it finally comes out on DVD."
"It's rare that a movie lives up to its hype, even rarer that the hype is transcended by the actual achievement. 12 YEARS A SLAVE does both. Aided by powerful performances and cinematography, director McQueen exposes the barbarity of dehumanisation, of treating people as property. Reviews focus on the brutality on display, and it's true that the film is not easy to watch, with its powerful juxtaposition of sublime scenery and human degradation. But to me the final scene is the most powerful of all: we are party to the kind of raw emotion that in the hands of lesser artists could easily descend into tawdriness or sentimentality. Here, as in the rest of the film, it is raised up high, as high as cinematic art can go."
"One of our partners was invited to TIFF for the premiere of Life of Crime so I was lucky to be able to tag along with him and watch these two great films along with The Lunchbox. I didn't initially even think of writing a review because I would hate to discuss something that the majority of the public hasn't seen yet because public opinion would be limited. But, seeing the reviews that some have published has pushed me to write a review of my own.In the beginning, the movie moves semi fast as far as getting into the central plot but not too fast that you don't get the opportunity to assess the characters. In fact, by the time Solomon (Ejiofor) is sold into slavery, in my opinion, his demeanor, education, and his family are established enough for you to invest enough emotion into him that by the end of the film you care enough about him to wonder if he and his family will ever be reunited.I don't understand how someone can say that they were bored because they are desensitized by the beatings and tortures that African American slaves endured during that dark time. Odd analogy but, I cried at the end the movie Titanic not because I was unaware of the fact that the ship would sink and eventually be the demise of thousands of people but because the story telling grasped my attention and pulled at my heart strings. Same case with 12 Years. Yes, you know Solomon along with the other unfortunate souls will endure physical and emotional pain and you might be well familiar with the tools and methods they accomplished this with but it makes it no less shocking, sad, or important. I wonder if this person saw the same movie that I saw, if at all, because without spoiling too much of the movie, there is a torture scene in which the camera not only zooms into what's occurring but it also seems to last forever to the point where I was so uncomfortable that I wanted the scene to end. McQueen does this throughout this film (along with many of his other films), his scenes make you uncomfortable mostly because his camera lingers on scenes that are very hard to watch.Surprisingly, the only time I got teary eyed was in a funeral scene where Ejiofor's acting shines and mostly with facial expressions (and some singing) you realize that he's finally succumbed to his situation versus how in the beginning he emotionally fought his sudden twist of fate. As far as the other actors, much has been said about Fassbander and Nyong'o's superior acting, rightly so, but I found myself being really impressed with Benedict Cumberbatch and Paul Dano's performances. Hopefully, we can all agree that Fassbander's character, Edwin Epps, is that of a tyrant and just an awful human being. Someone like that is easy to assess but Cumberbatch's William Ford is more complex. He's a slave owner yet he treats his slaves humanely, to an extent he cares about them but he definitely puts his and his families' interest above all, and although he doesn't partake in the beatings he sure doesn't interfere with the process. He makes you ask yourself if neutral people like him are good or bad for progress. I still don't know the answer to that. Paul Dano plays John Tibeats and his character is cruel and has horrible mood swings. The way he was played, I wondered if the person the character was based on had a mental disorder. He's uneducated (almost slow), not even respected within his peers, and overall just a loser. Not to make excuses for him but how could someone with those defects possibly be kind to another human being let alone a human who was considered inferior throughout that time. He too makes me question the hardships that other people, other than slaves, were going through during that time.Overall, this film had a great narrative, strong performances from the entire cast, and I would definitely recommend this film. I do have two complaints, though. I too felt that the ending was a bit abrupt. In all fairness, I'm not sure what kind of closure I was expecting but I felt like much was left unsaid. My biggest gripe of all has to be the torture scene I mentioned above in which Patsey (Nyong'o) yells something to Solomon and it just had John Ridley's over the top style written all over it. According to Solomon Northup's biography this exchange did not happen so why did Ridley feel the need to add such a dramatic statement? What was the need to create sexual(?) tension between Patsey and Solomon's character? The same could be said about a speech Solomon gives in the film. That too was fiction and not realistic but I guess they did that to emphasize on their message on hope."
"I've been in the industry for almost 20 years and I had to create an account to say this: This movie was bad. This was a bad movie. This script should have never seen a screen the way it stands. I don't know if Steve McQueen or someone else screwed with it so much that it no longer worked, but someone murdered this script.Characters appear and disappear for no reason. Plot lines are thrown in, rolled around and pulled out. Then there is the miracle ending that's not foreshadowed in any way - a total Hail Mary - like the producers suddenly said: 'Yo, Stevie, you're sitting at over 2 hours... End the thing already before we run out of cash.' Ugh... Never have God (or his human counterpart, Brad Pitt) save your movie in the last 10 minutes. That's first-year film school stuff.I was hoping for a film like 2001's Conspiracy (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266425/) but instead I got this. What a total shame. This story should have been a masterpiece. It should have been a classic.The only reason I don't give this movie a 1 is because it is beautifully shot. It betrays a grade-school-level interpretation of history (Northerners were beautiful and cultured while Southerners were drunk whore-mongers who rolled around with pigs), but at least it was nice to look at."
"Before I started reading reviews on IMDb I actually thought the cinema was a form of entertainment. Now I realise I was totally wrong. A silly comedy like ""Meet the Fockers"" or"" Legally Blonde"" is condemned as a complete waste of time.""I want my life back"" But a film lasting two and a half hours which shows a man kidnapped into slavery,beaten half to death and then rescued is considered worthy of 5 stars. If I had gone to the cinema alone I would have left after 15 minutes.What sort of people can enjoy watching other people being beaten senseless for two and a half hours.The only thing that kept me awake was the hope that the slaves would rise up and cut those nasty white throats.No such luck.The slave was rescued.A weak ending to to a weak pointless film."
"If any contemporary director deserves to be in the mainstream spotlight without compromising their style, it's Steve McQueen. His debut, Hunger, already had the hand of a confident filmmaker taking a fly-on-the-wall style to the grimy art-house. Shame was one of the finest films of its year for its impeccable depiction of an addiction to one of humanity's primal survival instincts resulting in self-destruction. I'm so happy that his latest film has gracefully conquered early Oscar favourites from the output of David O. Russell, Martin Scorsese and the now delayed film from George Clooney to become this year's Oscar frontrunner. During its festival run when the buzz first began, I took it upon myself to read the screenplay. While I can usually sink scripts within a few hours, the poetic density of 12 Years A Slave took several sittings across a week or two. Even on the page it was a harrowing, exhausting experience. It's a film that needs a have a gut to truly display the length of time, but the script is bloated in its brilliance.Naturally, scenes were cut (whether in the editing room or pre-production I don't know) and that's a blessing and a curse. Now in the film, we rush to Solomon Northup's capture, opening with scenes we shall revisit later on. I understand the decision to enter the world as quickly as possible, but I do feel it hurts its first act. As much as I jump for joy every time Scoot McNairy hides himself in a film, the transition from ordinary life to becoming kidnapped feels jarring and contrived. Who is Solomon Northup as a free man? What does he want? Maybe we don't know because there is no source for the matter. Maybe McQueen isn't interested in telling that story. At the very least, we definitely know that Solomon is a compelling character during his capture. Chiwetel Ejiofor is an actor I've always liked but he's never made an impression until now. His passion and commitment to his portrayal of Solomon is utterly captivating. While he can slink into the background of some scenes where he is not the focus, when it's time to shine he bursts a fuse.Unfortunately during this cluttered first act, it concerns itself too much with subplots that we know will not succeed. While they accomplish establishing the stakes at hand and rule out the 'why doesn't Solomon just' there's just too many abridged tales. Perhaps this is distracting just because I know the full stories from the script, but they should've went all or nothing with them. It results in editing that frustratingly refuses to let us into Solomon's headspace. We're along for the ride, but too frequently not Solomon's ride. During then we only get rare and rewarding glimpses into how he feels and his perspective on his past life stolen from him. Fortunately the film vastly improves once Solomon is free from the deliciously cruel Paul Giamatti to the spiteful live-wire Paul Dano. As the film focuses on his one-on-one conflicts and moral dilemmas, the film reaches intimate and truly challenging moments which is where the film's power lies. Fruitless subplots are dropped in favour of heartbreaking ones as we're introduced to the pitiful Patsey on the pathetic Edwin Epps' plantation.Michael Fassbender and Steve McQueen have been one of the most enthralling director/actor combination in recent years. They always bring out the best in each other. Here, it feels like they've reached their finest work yet, but still feels like their collaboration has just began. Fassbender's Edwin Epps is the film's most fascinating and complex character, a man who sincerely refuses to believe he is evil. He demonstrates the thesis of the film in that the authoritative caucasians didn't believe they were doing anything wrong. Many people have laid claim that he is pure evil, but I don't think that's the point, he belongs in a misguided world where he thinks his lust and affection is apt praise for Patsey's talent. While I may not have sympathy for him, he is a tortured soul, a regrettable and irreversible tragedy of mankind and this is thanks to Fassbender's incredible performance. His victim Patsey, played by talented newcomer Lupita Nyong'o, is an utter revelation. She may not have a fully developed character but in at least two powerful scenes, she makes the best out of what she can for a character that warrants the tears you will inevitably shed.One of the most consistent aspects of McQueen's films is the magnificent taste in cinematography and production design. Presumably from his art background, he's great at immersing you into his bleak visual worlds. Working with Sean Bobbit again, the cinematography is reliably enchanting. In true McQueen style, if a character must endure patiently, in this case Solomon hanging from a noose on the tips of his toes, we must endure with them. No shot this year, not even in the extraordinary Gravity, has been as stunning and unforgettable as the infamous long take of Patsey's lashes. It's a filmmaking masterclass in just a few short minutes. Despite the shaky first half hour, it's all redeemed in its harrowing final 15 minutes. It's the greatest sequence I've seen in a long time and I've never had a scene make me a blubbering mess quite like it. Yes, the jump to his kidnapping feels abrupt and there's no sense of relief to his inevitable freedom, but this is all calculated to mirror the struggle of his experience and we've felt every beat. 12 Years A Slave is a powerful testament to the endurance of the human spirit with its theme of injustice applicable to any point in history that earns the right to be one of the best of the year. After a string of lightweight Best Picture choices from the Academy, this will be a refreshing choice. 9/10"
"Going into a film like this you somewhat know what to expect. You ready yourself for callous suffering without end for no other reason than a system was just set that way, hope snuffed by despair. You know the injustice and stupidity will revolt, because it is just so blatantly wrong it baffles that it would be allowed to go on for even a day in plain sight.We can't avoid the bluntness if we are to confront that world. Slaves are casually stabbed and thrown overboard on the journey south, a mother is separated by her kids in a slave sale, down at the bayous they are beaten, a girl flogged for wanting a piece of soap, treated at best as mischievous kids or at worst as animals. We see how our man is over the years beaten or numbly retreats to protect himself into a hollow shell. But what good does it do if it merely blunts you to cleanse? Serious question here. Most films work in this way, from the Greek model demanding catharsis, a cleansing from evil so that we can go on about our lives. But if we just go on about our lives merely relieved of a burden, has any actual change taken place? If I shed a few tears at a film like this and the next day take out my work stress on my kids, am I really cleansed of the same root ignorance that at one time supported slavery? Southerners were not in support of an apparent evil after all from their pov, but of what they saw as a right or a tradition or a natural necessity.So I'm glad the film does these two things right, it's the only way it can truly be an eye-opener on the subject. It runs the gamut of people who exist today with the same ignorance: among them the young overseer scorned because he was outsmarted, the jealous and neglected wife, the white worker who betrays the letter to jump ahead in his career, the plantation owner who is thoughtful yet won't buy the kid with his mother because of the cost.And offers no catharsis. The exasperation is sweated out with a stoic capacity for having to be in the world, sentimental music doesn't try to waste all the pent-up energy into simple spine-tingling, the world itself is full of texture and sound because past the imposed confines there was still a world that extended in the distance and went on.I would only have the first segment of normal life much longer so that we'd be more deeply torn from our safet. All that staring into a clump of sunset trees in the distance much more intense because somewhere beyond that is still home and a wife, and this is the greatest visual education I could wish for anyone: not giving up into suffering as not losing sight of the horizon where loved ones are. The notion of persistence solely visual in the arduous field work itself. And only a whole separate film could do justice to the richness of slave songs, their call and response, their hidden narrative and spontaneous order.But a film that already calls up these intuitions has worked more than most, and any future film on the subject will have to build on this.No cleansing because there's nothing to so easily pretend like we can cleanse ourselves of and leave behind in the theater, all the evil in the film does not arise from intrinsic evil itself (otherwise we'd never be able to become better persons) but conditional ego and ignorance and we live every day with these things. If you relieve us with catharsis all that energy goes away. If you don't, it becomes a ball of lead that we have swallowed and have to carry with us back home to our kids, so that maybe it can work its own answer in this life."
"Why Do We Watch Movies?We watch movies to be entertained, to be educated, to be moved.My husband and I recently went to see ""12 Years a Slave"". It was, quite bluntly, dreadful. The movie was based on the personal accounting of Solomon Northup, a free black man, who in 1841 was abducted and sold into slavery. I did not read his book, but judging by what I have read, the movie did not follow the book very loyally. What a shame. I think I will read it now, if only to redeem a story so deserving to be told.I do not profess to be a producer, a director, an actor, or a cinematographer. I do not presume to state how this film could have been better. I just want to tell you why I did not like what could have been one of the best movies of all time. I am a middle-aged, white, Canadian woman, and it is a testament to our society that I actually have to qualify that. I am so grateful to not have lived in an age of slavery. No man has the right to enslave another, and to have lived in an era where one race habitually and acceptably treated another as less than human would have been excruciatingly abhorrent to me. Slavery is wrong. Slavery is evil.I have no doubt that many aspects of slavery in the 1840's were accurately depicted in this film, and it truly had all the elements of a classic, with a compellingly profound story and phenomenal actors. However, the direction was horrendous, the screen writing decimating. The protracted, paralyzingly boring close-ups and shots of gazing at trees were not evocative or artful, but only served to sap the life from the story for me. Added to that, the excessively prolonged moments of having to watch Solomon tap-dancing at the end of a noose, and the constant, brutal whipping scenes made my feelings of pity and disgust and rage almost dulled to the horror. The cinematography could have been so much better. Settings are characters unto themselves in movies, and instead of bringing to life a Louisiana in the 1840's, I was treated to long minutes of Spanish moss waving in the breeze. It was dull and lack-luster, and added nothing to the film.The only reason I gave this movie two stars instead of one (zero not being an option here) is because of the memorable performance of some of the actors.Chiwetel Ejiofor's depiction of Solomon was excellent, considering what he was given to work with. The screenwriter's stripping treatment of who Solomon really was was very unfortunate. From what I understand, he was intelligent and resourceful, used his ingenuity to enhance the lives of his fellow slaves, and was actually forced to be a slave-driver himself for a portion of his enslavement. Including this in the screenplay might have given his character much more dimension, and shown me a man who I could actually root for, instead of just pity immensely.Lupita Nyong'o was extraordinary as the young slave, Patsey, and is an actress to be watched for in future.Michael Fassbender is always brilliant, even in crappy movies. This performance was no exception. He was evil incarnate, and made me suspect that Master Epps very likely had syphilis, so crazed and bizarre was he portrayed.Paul Giamatti does sleaze so well, and here he did not disappoint.It must be noted that I was downright embarrassed that Brad Pitt as producer cast himself in the role of the big white hero, his acting no better or worse than usual.Perhaps the best performance was that of Paul Dano. As a white-trash overseer with middle-management power and impotent rage, he made me believe what these men might truly have been like in the times of American slavery.How sad I am that this movie was not all it could have been. In the end, did it make me think? Yes, but for all the wrong reasons. Was I entertained, educated or moved? Sadly, I was not."
"I feel that a Best Picture Oscar winner should 1) be a film that you would recommend, and 2) be a film that you would watch again. ""12 Years a Slave"" is neither.""12 Years a Slave"" falls squarely in the torture-porn film genre like ""Hostel"" or ""Passion of the Christ."" So if you are into that kind of cinema, this may be a good film for you. If you like well-directed and well-written films with a strong narrative, plot, character development, sense of place, and historical context and meaning, then this film will disappoint you.The last scene of the film when Solomon is reunited with his family is unbelievably bad but sums up the whole film: bad direction, bad writing, a big mistake and waste of acting talent.For heavens sake, read the book and learn Solomon's story but avoid this disaster."
"In today's world, we are told to be politically correct. but this movie is a waste of time, nothing special to me .I consider myself on the left side of the political arena.but I do wonder if we are being bombarded with this type of stories, consider the butler .12 years a slave , etc. I was expecting a great movie , but what I watched 2 hours of boring and I mean boring story.he the lead character is kidnapped and put into 12 years of being a slave , he was swapped between owners,sounds like a great movie basis , well it was not .instead it became a boring tale of this mans journey,roots is a much more moving story that covered slavery , also brad pitt as a amish ,I was waiting for vanilla ice to show up and them build a barn.I hate to ask this question but I will ask, does this movie appeal more to a black audience that a mixed audience, as I stated before roots, boyz in nthe hood,and on it goes are all worth watching, but this is not what I expected, I was very disappointed ."
"I was shocked with this film. I ended up wondering what on earth the director had in mind when he was making the film? The sad thing is that the subject of the film is extremely interesting but the director lost all chances of making this a great film.Slavery in America is a huge issue indeed and I do understand that the Caucasian people in the US still try to deal with the issue. And most of them feel guilt. It is more or less how most Germans feel for the atrocities that Hitler has done. BUT someone expects that a film on slavery from an acclaimed director will either go into the core of the problem and prompt you to learn and understand things or will present a human story in a way that can create a case for the issue.This film is doing nothing. It wastes 134 minutes to tell a story that could be told in no more than 15 minutes. When you have a 15 minutes storytelling then you need either to focus on building a characters' film or to insert in the storytelling questions that the viewer should consider. But instead of this the film is wasting all the good actors in an endless cycle of the same idea: ""what cruelty humans could cause to humans""!. But we DO KNOW this and we've seen it many times. Please make a point! The most hypocritical scene of the film is the Patsey's whip. Until that scene the film was boring, with this scene it became hypocritical because at that point I think that the director thought: ""I can not do a film about slavery without showing a cruel scene; I've forgotten to do this so far, so I do it now""! I learn nothing from the film and I didn't entertain myself at all. I am wondering why all cinema critics have given such victorious reviews. I am sorry to say that I think that the film tries to capitalize on the ""white people's guilty"" and the director has blackmailed the audience by saying: ""If you do not like it the film then you are just like the bad whites that they have done these things to the slaves"". I am sorry Mr. director, this is not the case, YOU have exploited the issue of slavery to put money in your pocket. You have succeeded and congratulations on the marketing success, but this is a bad film and will remain like this!"
"so incredible.... the trailers don't do any justice to the film. it's so powerful lingering unconventional it presents so many variables to that system one might not consider. the situations they show linger and you get the full effect of them too. you really get the sense that it is based on an account. characters will appear and vanish. they will not have little arcs and get give the audience satisfaction. it just is what it is. nothing is edited to bits either. this film is the work of a genius!and about the musical selection, good lord. there are long bouts of silence and parts where it just freaks you out. it was really effective and hypnotizing. I was surprised to see Hans Zimmerman did the music. this is far beyond anything I've heard from him. Not the usual inception foghorns or military hum drum. also a great deal of real folksongs incorporated into it. I love when films incorporate the actually used folksongs. period pieces should be filled with music. when there were no modern devices people would sing!people can't say that this is unrealistic either as it's an actual account. glad McQueen brought it to the public eye and in such an untethered fashion. I'll probably watch this on repeat when it comes out. I'll have to check out McQueen's other films. haven't seen them yet for some reason"
"There is so much badness in our modern world and, because of the non-stop flood of digital information, it's coming at us ALL the time. Therefore, if I'm going to see a film about a horrible subject (which I'm not opposed to), I want to feel like I'm being subjected to it for a reason. I want to feel that the filmmaker has something to add to the conversation about it, draws some conclusions, makes a point that hasn't already been made. Otherwise, I feel like that much more badness has been added to my life for little purpose.That is my problem with ""12 Years a Slave,"" a formally accomplished film but one which left me cold. It's two hours of watching the absolute worst humanity can inflict on itself, and beyond the fairly obvious point that slavery was a horrible dark stain on American history, there isn't much point to be made and certainly no sense of enlightenment on the subject. It's a film executed to make its audience feel bad, and it succeeds tremendously on those terms. But it fails in most other ways that make great movies truly great. I felt terrible for the slaves depicted in the film in the abstract, but the individual characters are never fully developed enough to feel bad about them as actual people. It's a hectoring film, one scene after another of hateful, brutal violence (physical, sexual, emotional) inflicted on one set of human beings by another, and the problem is that the people who will actually go to see this movie don't need to be told how terrible this kind of human evil is, while those who might serve to be enlightened on that subject wouldn't see a movie like this in a million years.Chiwetel Ejiofor gives a solid performance in the central role of a free black man who's kidnapped and sold into slavery for a dozen years. But his character never really came alive for me, and that limited the impact of Ejiofor's performance. Michael Fassbender is just asked to play crazy as a villainous plantation owner, while Brad Pitt shows up toward the film's conclusion and makes a speech about the evils of slavery right before our main character is rescued. This scene and Pitt's appearance as pretty much the only white person in the movie who's not either evil or indifferent seems a bit convenient given that he's a producer of the film.Sarah Paulson is memorable as Fassbender's equally villainous wife, while Alfre Woodard has a tiny role that teases us with the more complex issues about black and white relations in the slavery-era South that this film could have addressed had it been more interested in something other than the literalness of human suffering.Grade: C"
"NO! This is NOT Oscar caliber material, sorry. So we have this virtuoso violinist that is kidnapped, enslaved and tortured. Good story. But what the heck is McQueen doing? Minutes pass with images of trees and landscapes. (remember ""Tree of Life""--probably not). Not to mention the lifeless performance by our protagonist. I do like him as an actor but he pales in comparison to the supporting cast. Yes, Fassbender is good, but darn, that Paul Dano is something else. Watch out for him in the future. (see There will be Blood). The topic of slavery is of course a terrible chapter in our history, but the movie is simply not up to the task of relaying this emotion."
"A true story, made into something not real. I could not get into the movie at all. When I watch a movie I like to be captivated and taken in for the ride. So much of it was so bad that it jarred. When slaves were supposed to be digging a paddock they were just tapping hoes on the ground. When slaves were cotton picking they were just playing with the cotton. All the slaves were over weight, and wore clean un-tatty clothes. Quite often the actors looked as though they were uncomfortable doing what they were doing. Those prolonged whipping scenes did not feel real. When he was left hanging, this again did not seem to be at all real. Someone wriggling a bit on the end of a rope. Where was the suspense and drama? Instead an overly long scene. Boring! It could have been a great film. But for me, it did not work at all. It would have been good to hear the story after he was released from slavery. How he tried to prosecute his captors. How he became an anti slavery campaigner. I do understand how for a lot of Americans this is the first time they have seen how slaves were treated in their country, but compared to Django Unchained, which was a great movie, this was awful."
"12 Years a Slave (2013)Who can possibly argue against the power of this kind of movie, and the injustice that it waves as a welcome reminder? Superbly directed and acted (especially leading man Chiwetel Ejofor playing Solomon Northup), and set with high levels of realism in pre-Civil War America, there is little to separate what the filmmakers intended and what they achieved. A work of excellence.It is not, however, quite the masterpiece it might have been. I don't mean the story or the level of competence here at all. I mean the way the story is told, the choice to simply tell it like it was.That means that the presentation is quite linear (excepting a few gratuitous flashbacks that seem like a last minute editing decision). And uncomplicated. This is the biggest surprise. I mean, the basics might seem enough—a free black man in Saratoga goes to Washington and is kidnapped and made a slave, and he remains a slave until his recovery 12 years later. But that is actually the entire movie.Oh, I know, the details are missing in that sentence. But it is these details where the movie succeeds too well. We are shown the horrors of slavery and made to experience them. It isn't that this is ignoble or unimportant. On the contrary, this is an ""important"" film and should be seen. But in some weirdly surreal way, we already know everything that happens in these details. Do we need to see a woman, naked and tied to a post, whipped and whipped and whipped, with screaming in our ears? Many will say yes. We need to feel that horror even a little bit (through a movie) to understand how utterly unbelievably horrible slavery was. I would just argue back that I don't really want to be tortured directly to confirm what I already fully agree with. It's just a choice you want to make as a moviegoer. It's similar to watching a kidnapping movie—do you want to experience the inner and outer torments of the kidnapped, or see some larger view of a kidnapping situation and the complexities of that kind of plot?For me, then the movie was excellent at being literal, but that's not enough. For example, there is absolutely no hint at what the family did when Solomon didn't return home after his trip to Washington. Did they search? Worry? How? Who helped, who ignored them? Etc. That's just one of many complexities the movie avoids for the sake of a direct experience of the protagonist. I hope that gives a sense of where this unpleasant, terrific movie leaves you, and whether to watch it."
"I was hoping for much more - sadly,we've seen It all before. Since the brilliant and awe-Inspiring 'Roots',nothing In this genre has been at all special and '12 years a slave' Is no exception. As unexciting as It Is predictable,this Movie gives us nothing new and Just re-treads old ground. We've seen enough of pre-emancipation stories. We KNOW what a terrible time slaves In America had without constant reminders like this. Black folk have enough reason to hate White folk without stirring up hackneyed old stories. If you can watch this the whole way through without falling asleep waiting for something exciting to happen then good for you. Giving this Movie 'top marks' just because of feelings of guilt(If you are white) or because of solidarity and mutual hatred of the Slavers (If you are black) Is a naive decision. This boring piece of Americana will soon be forgotten. As the song goes...""Tell me the same old story....""."
"The story is of course painful so it's loaded with emotion. Human beings suck. We get it. But there is no character development and no plot. All we know is Plat's physical pain and his apparent strength to endure it. We feel pity for him. We can sympathize, but we are given very little opportunity to empathize. The actors pain doesn't match the beatings. When the carpenters build, they're not really building. When the field workers are working they're not really working. Brad Pitt's monologue was embarrassing and amateur.Sorry for the analogy, but it's like a porn movie where we are here for the immediate gratification, not the substance.Sorry...I just don't understand they hype."
"""12 Years a Slave"" is a gripping, mostly well-made, but basically false film. To say it finally shows the brutal truth about U. S. chattel slavery just proves how blind opinion-shapers are about U.S. racism, past and present.Was the main outrage of slavery really that it could engulf a cultured, free black individual? That's what the hero suggests when, speaking to a sympathetic white, he protests the injustice of HIS captivity. As an afterthought, he also observes that slavery in general is unjust. Several of the other slaves with whom he interacts are inexplicably well-spoken and the camera lingers repeatedly on their faces to remind us of their stoic nobility.The filmmaker shows keen understanding of psychological nuance in the relationships between masters, other whites, and slaves. He evidently meant to evoke viewer empathy with victims who seem to be a lot like ""us."" This film is meant to make liberals feel good about ""our"" distance from that world. It predictably has outraged some reactionaries who don't like exposing the warts of U.S. ""democracy.""The main truth of U.S. slavery is not the story of extraordinary individuals either as victims or avengers but of ordinary people brutalized and traumatized, accommodating and finally resisting the private appropriation of their persons and their labor. The film that tells this truth won't be made until all those who labor, black and white, start speaking for themselves.Rita Freed"
"I found this movie about as realistic as a Muffets movie. Every slave seemed to have an Oxford education which made it hard to believe. Don't waste your money or time. I can not believe it is up for an Oscar when there were so many better movies out there. I still can not get over all of the great reviews I have read concerning this movie, am I the only person that got this. I saw this with two friends that had the same feelings as myself and if you look at the top movies at the theater right now you will see it is not even in the top five. This should tell you what the people really think of it. So if you must, go see it but keep an open mind and think for yourselves. It doesn't seem very real."
"If you plan to go and watch the three Academy Awards winning '12 Years a Slave' (best movie, best adapted scenario, best supporting actress), be warned that it comes without a patient information leaflet. It should have had one. The movie will expose you unsolicitedly to massive amounts of racism, physical violence and psychological cruelty. And for what reason? Is there anything in the story that alludes to historic events we did not know about? Will we walk out of the theater as better human beings than we were before? Does this production leave us with an experience that bears relevance for the way we live our lives today? Unlike you may expect me to answer these three question, I'm going to say yes.Yes: most of us didn't realize yet that the elite of white celebrities today have so mindlessly accumulated so much power, that they feel no hesitation abusing two-hundred years of creating prosperity by enslaving millions of Africans for a mere defamation of cinematography. Yes: after watching this destruction of suggestiveness and denial of our imaginative abilities we will have become more aware of the true nature of art, that its magic is not in getting our questions answered by a nifty recreation of reality, but in challenging our sense of reality in ways that awaken a desire for other questions instead of answers.Yes: when we are offered an opportunity to reflect on the storyline from a present day perspective, i.e. when we try to become more conscious to the thought that we are living in an era where our debt slash guilt is sublimated in seeing a black man saved from his misfortune in the ocean of badness by a rare drop of white Christian goodness personified by the movie's producer Brad Pitt himself, how could that not be relevant for our lives today?'12 Years a Slave' is by far the most lazy and disgusting piece of anti- cinema ever produced, shamelessly just for the money and the fame of its creators alone, at the expense of non-consensual emotional investment by an audience that the movie industry has imagined to own and enslave. Indeed, ""A man does how he pleases with his property. At the moment, Platt, I am of great pleasure. You be goddamn careful I don't come to wantin' to lightenin' my mood no further."""
"Two stars from me, simply because I feel that ""12 Years A Slave"" was nothing much more than a movie exploiting and shocking in a rather crude fashion.I felt that the producers were conducting more of a display of slavery's cruelties, rather than getting us immersed in the travails of the victims so we could really empathize with them and even more recognize the evils of slavery. Rather, I felt that the producers were working too hard to say to the audience, ""You think you are shocked now, just wait until you see what we show you next."" I was not made to feel the pain. I was made into only an observer of someone else's pain.Those with differing views are welcome to relate why, but please, let's for once drop the usual extremes we see these days when it comes to such a thing here as being negative and critical of an African-American movie's rendering of such a serious and terrible subject.Can we keep from giving the movie a top star rating for fear of being called a racist? Do not worry that liking ""Schindler's List"" better than ""12 Years A Slave"" is based on prejudice. To me, the former was far better produced.Can we keep from giving the movie a top star rating because we have ""white guilt?"" Mea culpas such as, ""I loved Roots, and Denzel is my favorite actor, are unnecessary when one low-rates this particular movie.To me, it just comes down to my feeling that the movie was poorly done. Paying to see it in the first place allows my critique to be made with no strings attached. I would like to see more of the same from other reviewers."
"Let's be honest about it: this spotlight on the darkest days of American history is a particularly British triumph. The brilliant director (and artist) Steve McQueen and outstanding Chiwetel Ejiofor, as the eponymous Solomon Northup, are both British; even Michael Fassbender, in the main support role as a sadistically brutal slave-owner, is half British; and Benedict Cumberbatch makes an appearance as a 'kinder' slave owner.But, of course, there is a vast array of American talent here too. As always, Sean Bobbitt is inspiring as director of photography, making full use of the Louisiana locations. And a host of fine US actors make cameo appearances, notably Brad Pitt (who was one of the 10 producers), Paul Giamatti (looking as if he had walked straight out of the TV mini series ""John Adams""), Sarah Paulson and Alfre Woodard. In her first film role, Lupita Nyong'o gives a heart-rending performance as a young slave who is horrendously abused. Original music by Hans Zimmer and use of contemporary songs add to the searing atmosphere of the workMcQueen is unrelenting in his focus: except for short pieces at the beginning and the end of the film, all the time is the period in captivity and, except for occasional glimpses of humanity, we see the slaves subjected to humiliation and horror again and again and again. McQueen's style is slow and penetrating with some long and wordless scenes totally captivating.As a piece of social history, this movie is simply stunning - a virtual blow to the solar plexus. As a cinematic work, it has some challenges: there is no conventional narrative arc in which a plot unfolds or a character develops because Northrup is confined to a small geographical space where he can only survive by keeping as low a profile as possible; the characters are literally black and white with little subtlety or nuance; and there is not really a sense that the period of incarceration is more than a decade.At the start and finish of the film, we are reminded that this is a true story based on the book written by Northup in 1853, once he finally re-acquired his freedom (in a pedestrian act of bureaucracy rather than anything more dramatic or violent). As if Northup has not suffered enough, we learn that his legal actions against both those who sold and bought him failed in the courts. A special award should go to McQueen's Dutch partner Bianca Stigter who discovered Northup's book and recommended it to the director."
"Steve McQueen's first film was a masterpiece and since then it's seriously going downhill: Shame was pretentious and moralist and it didn't make me feel for the main character an film felt it was misogynistic in the way the main character's sister was being punished for him and for trying to be happy and alive. Anyway, it at least had the merit to have style (even if it was over substance : I didn't learn anything I didn't know about sex addict) because 12 Years a Slave lacks this : style, it could have been directed by any Hollywood director. There is a bit of Steve McQueen left in it (the hanging scene is a good example), but not much. First the music is atrocious and feels like it's been whacked in two minutes on garage band, not original, boring and useless except for one scene where the soundtrack gets menacing and slowly covers the Diegetic music that the main character plays. The rhythm of the film is flawed, it's smoothed and fast at the beginning when the main guy is being kidnapped, then it's completely all over the place and you have the feeling that's it's been 4 years a slave and not 12. It's also so Manichaean it's painful to watch : bad vs good. The hero is good, the guys that kidnap him are good but suddenly they're bad, the guys that ship him to the south are bad, and it carries on till then end, thank god there's a few good actors to bring some subtlety (Paul Dano is magnificent in his pure evilness and you detect some madness in him ), Michael Fassbender is a brutal drunk you kind of feel sorry for even if he is a pure monster. But then you Paul Giamati as bad bad ( in every way he's an awful actor with zero charisma and whose ugliness than no charm can even save), then it's poor black men and evil or cowardly white people : best example Cumberbatch who looks lost in the film, his wife bad woman, but the worse is the good white men : The hero's friend who is gentle and kind but is nothing else than kindness, his character clearly doesn't exist, and then there's Brad Pitt : being the producer of the film he gives himself the part of the good spirited and modern white man who is going to save the hero and lecture the bad Fasbender that there will be payback day for the bad things southerner are doing to slaves. And he looks like a Pre hippie kind of rebel mixed with his Chanel advert homeless look. At that point I felt like getting a pair of scissors and slashing the screen. On top of that the film is ultra predictable, the hero is reunited to his family and he has a grandson and everybody cries (well what about all the poor other slaves? very subtle happy ending Mr McQueen) we are all supposed to cry. it's not the only emotional blackmail in the film the scene or the hero's lover is whipped, and he is forced to whip her, the scene is just pornographic violence, pointless in the film except forcing the spectator to cry. It's not about the whipping that is wrong it's the way the scene is depicted that is morally wrong, like the rape scene under a beautiful red moon, why should a horrible scene like that aesthetic and almost poetic, after Shame I really wonder what kind of problem Steve McQueen has with women. A lot more efficient is the hanging scene which is a long scene where the hero is hanging from a tree tip toe and trying not to be strangle by a rope while in the background business goes as usual: people doing their daily chores. It works because it shows how atrocity can happen anywhere anytime with a lovely weather in everyday life, that horror can take place in the ordinary, it's so understated and not stylized that it is refreshing, it's a long still shot and paradoxically it's one of the most interesting of the whole film. The film is just a real story being told with no real message behind it : OK it's awful that freed black men were adducted in the north to be enslaved in the south but what is Steve McQueen is trying to say? That slavery is bad? well we figured that out and Spielberg made a better job with The Colour Purple , even Django Unchained is more convincing in depicting the atrocity of slavery, and even if it's caricature the characters in it are more authentic and subtle than in Manichaean 12 years a slave. OK so maybe it's about depicting the evil of earthlings? Well Manderlay and the The legend of n**** Charley's were more effective, because it at least knew what it wanted to be, and those were more believable while being pure fiction because their character had depth. The other massive flaw in the film is it's long and boring, some scenes are pointless, they don't help the story telling they have no message or do not give you any emotion. The dialogs are so contrived and theatrical that it's affects the whole film, you have the feeling that some scenes would be marvelous in a theater but not in cinema. Actually the film works best when Steve McQueen resolves to use visual to express himself than when he uses dialogs You do get the feeling of anger there was in Hunger from times to times, mainly at the beginning but then it is dis-activated by all those boring illustrative and over explained scenes. I'm sorry but I don't want to get bored during a film that treat something as serious as slavery."
"I honestly think this film is overrated. Don't get me wrong. Fantastic acting. Definitely I think Chiwetel and Michael Fassbender are Oscar worthy. Would be surprised to not see them nominated. I even really enjoyed Paul Dano's small part in the film. Lupito was also good, but I wasn't as wowed with her as I was with the others. Plus, I think Brad Pitt was the worst of the bunch. I've liked him in other movies, but he was the weak link here and felt out of place.I also didn't care much for Steve McQueen's directing choice. Like, he would use these really long shots of Chitwetel's face or example. Not doing anything but breathing. Some people might like that artsy stuff...but I just wanted to get on with the program already. Also the film just feels really long. Its only around 2 hours and 10 min long. But it felt like 3. And I realize that slavery was absolutely brutal but I just personally felt like the film was trying to much to make you cry and grab you by the heart. And I just didn't feel that way. And I'm not some robot. I cry a lot at movies. Last thing I didn't like, ""aging"" Solomon (Chiwetel). They add some grey to his hair to signify that 12 years had past. But did absolutely nothing else. He still looked the same. Plus, I don't even feel like the movie adequately showed that 12 years had gone by (except for the title, and at the end of the movie, his kids are grown up). I felt like there was no sense of time in the movie. It seemed like the events only took place over a year. None of the other characters ""aged"" either.But those were my main problems with it. Otherwise, its a pretty decent flick and should be checked out at least for the performances."
"I was fortunate enough to have read the ghost written biography prier to seeing the film adaptation, and am glad I did.the book was a historically correct tale of a man's misfortune, and the people he was involved with along the way.( good and bad )the movie is a great big serve of white guilt depicting people completely differently to author. the movie went as far as to make villains out of people the book spoke kindly of. I strongly encourage anyone to read the book and be astounded at how different the story lines are. you will also be confronted by how aggressively the film hammers in it's obvious racial Davide, completely unlike the biography it is based on. there should be a disclaimer at the start indicating that this is loosely based on fact and is in no way a historical record. I also believed the director has tried really hard to be arty and it just comes off as obnoxious. there is over a minute of staring at the protagonist while he stares at scenery? why? This film is in no way worthy of any awards or honors, but will be nominated lest the awards panels will be labeled racist."
"Making a movie about a Hollocaust is a surefire way to have your movie labeled a classic. Be it about the destruction of the native American nations and theft of their land, the murder of the European Jews or the enslavement of millions of Africans movies about how awful things can be real award winners. The gravity of the evil injustice is enough to catapult a mediocre script and production into an award winning epic. Even if the movie is not very good.The plot of this film is that slavery is bad. No really, its really bad. We have to tell you that it was bad. Very bad. Awful, in fact! This film reminds me of another stinker, called ""The Boost"". In that movie the lesson was that drugs are bad. Really bad. Incredibly bad. In case you missed it, drugs are not good. By the first 20 minutes I got it. Slavery was no fun at all.Here's the plot: Solomon Northrop (Chietel Ejiofor) is a free black man living an idyllic life in 1841 New York. He is gullible as heck and agrees to go with 2 slavers to Washington where slavery is legal. It never occurs to him that even free black men should watch themselves in slave country. After being plied with liquor, he wakes up in chains. He then has to work and get beaten for 12 years. Boy I didn't know slavery was bad until this movie. (sarcasim) There really is no plot just a lot of beatings.What I found interesting was that white people in New York were delighted to meet black people. They were welcome into stores and parties and taken on trips. White people in the south were uniformly evil. They would beat a black person nearly to death just for getting a bar of soap. (Except for Brad Pitt, but he was the Producer.) They didn't really work their plantations so much as use them as platforms for the torture.I give it a 3, It was an effort to show a horrible institution that can never be forgotten. But I didn't think it was all good versus all evil. I don't believe 1840s New Yorkers behave like white delegated to the Democratic Convention, nor do I believe that all Southerners were 100% vicious all the time. Yes Slavery was bad. I got it."
"This film is a beautifully crafted and harrowing tale. It is, to me, an important film for all white people to see (I am a white person myself). The emotions portrayed in this film are those that all white people should absorb, and then reflect on the fact that oppression is still a strong, ugly force in our lives. I have seen Solomon's expressions in the faces of the young, black men I have known. We do not live in a ""post-racial"" society. I strongly encourage people to watch this film and reflect on your white privilege. I cannot imagine what it would be like to see this as a black person, and my only dissatisfaction with this film is that our society requires the pain and distress of people of color to educate white people."
"My high expectations for this film, based on it's awards and nominations, critical acclaim, and general reputation, were ultimately not met as this film that neither revealed anything new about the subject of slavery, nor fulfilled any satisfying sense of interest in or appreciation for the characters.The original story may or may not have been compromised for this film adaptation, but the dramatic arc seemed to me relatively slight, and the characters and the dialog old and cliché. I felt like ""12 Years a Slave"" offered little more on the slavery film than had been presented in the past.I have technical complaints as well. I thought the acting was often over the top. The characters lacked real depth, subtlety, or originality. In life, are people always this one-dimensional? Also, I never understand the need to place recognizable actors in small roles? It's distracting to see Michael K Williams (of ""The Wire"" and ""Boardwalk Empire"") in the film for only about 5 minutes (he had two scenes). Or Brad Pitt, or Paul Giamatti... it just is there to remind me that this is a big financial production and not a story.Overall, I was simply too distracted by so many bad moments and production details to allow me to forget that this was basically big Hollywood ""Oscar-bait""."
"Was really looking forward to this having read critics reviews. However while there is no doubt this depicts the terrible practices of slavery it is a horrid way to spend a Saturday night - and to what effect. Steve McQueen (the director not the great actor whose fame he is possibly benefiting from)undoubtedly knows how to create emotion in the crudest of ways using scenes which would abhor any fair person. However there is very little signs of skillful film making just a formulaic hitting of peoples emotional and moral buttons. We came out feeling drained, like after the worst day in 10 years at work or worse. Would not recommend friends pay to feel the same. Can not imagine a mental state where someone would see this and feel better. Advice; avoid - please let me know if anyone felt different after seeing."
"This film made my eyes bleed it was that bad. If you have been alive for more than 10 minutes you will know how bad slavery was and all this film does is re- iterates what everyone already knows. There's no plot, storyline, character development, nothing. I am baffled how anybody can like seeing a black man get beaten for 2 hours and say that it's a good viewing, disgusting. I had hugely high expectations of this film due to the media hyping it up to being the 'best movie ever made'' but quite frankly it was one of the worst films I have ever seen. No surprise either that brad Pitt helped direct it and he turned up an hour before the end to become the hero. Overall a hugely disappointing movie and I would not this to my worst enemy"
"Isn't it ridiculous that our society went so far to be politically correct that it crossed the line of common sense? If you don't give an Oscar to a film that depicts slavery - you are a racist, if you say something positive about Palestine or Iran - you are anti-Semite, if you give a preference to a Caucasian over African American in the U.S. (based on the skills!) - you are a racist again, if you smile to a woman - you are sexually harassing her (wait, gay harassment is coming, so you won't be allowed to smile or make jokes to anyone!). The story plot is quite simple: a free black man is sold to slavery and is later saved. But instead of making the movie multi-dimensional, deep and engaging, the story-tellers ""communicate"" the story through brutality and violence, as if someone on the face of the earth needs a proof that slavery was bad, and as if slaves were used nearly only as punching bags by sadistic white people. Seriously, ask yourself: how many times can you re-watch this film? Will you be enjoying it after re-watching? Will you be re-watching it several times? There were several worthy movies nominated for Oscar this year (e.g. The Wolf of Wall Street or even Captain Phillips), but, no, lets be politically correct and avoid being labeled racists, lets give the Best Picture to a mediocre, sadistic film about slavery.1 star for the acting, which still didn't save the film."
"As a former northerner I knew something was amiss at the get go in this film. Have you ever been to Philadelphia, recently? The Saratoga News clips mentioned in other reviews cite such a dramatically different account of this main characters plight as to almost be seen as terrorism. The incite to riot appears to be the main goal of this film and I found it appalling. With every scene, a white southerner, and don't forget to include those evil women as well this time around, was grimacing with delight to defile, defeat, and attempt to kill their chattel. Does that make any sense when you want productivity?I thought ""Gone With the Wind"" was racist and after watching this horror film, I redefined the term. It is completely irresponsible for the Producers to have funded this effort. The ""Passion of Christ"" I could only watch using the option for the blind captions. But I found I did not have the stomach to complete this even worse aberration of film. The music of dread, scary drumbeats, and overall cruelty were incessant undertones to further complete the torture saga. I pray the truth about this man's account comes to bear and that those so affected to further indemnify the South will balance their views with more accuracy. I am horrified this film was an award winning, highly acclaimed manipulation of history to exploit for profit. Slavery is alive and well today and is a serious threatening global issue. Perhaps this debate will highlight a topic for the next award winning effort. God Bless!"
"This ""black exploitation film"" lacks any real sense of narrative, instead it showcases a near-sardonic attempt at complete savagery. The film is highly racist against white people, as it attempts to capitalize on the ""brutal"" scenes and endear the white audience as somehow responsible for slavery, which we of the present, are in no way culpable.It is ineffective as both a polemic and drama. Brad Pitt (one of the film's producers) appearing as a ridiculous, self righteous cartoon, lowers it even more into the territory of baseless sentimentalism.The director is working simply on hyperbolic elements, which make this film highly ""unreal"". No doubt he is merely using it as visual propaganda, for what cause, remains to be seen.I would not take such a film to be serious at all."
"The movie is filmed artfully and it certainly portrays the evils of racism and slavery in a historically accurate way. However, practically all that evil is subtly (and not so subtly) blamed on the Bible, which is far from being historically accurate. Moreover, it is theologically flawed. The main driving force behind chattel slavery was and is economical, not theological. It is true that in the days in which slavery was still legal the Bible was repeatedly misquoted in order to justify such an abuse, but it is also true that the Bible was the main driving force behind the most important abolitionist movements both in the USA and everywhere else in the world. In this movie Christianity is indicted with being the sole origin of the evils associated with slavery, without showing that true Christians were among the only ones who were trying to end slavery once and for all. To prove that I have evidence to support my claim I will say that in ancient Israel slavery differed greatly from the sort of slavery that used to be commonplace in the USA. In ancient Israel people chose to sell themselves and their children as slaves (actually, serfs is a more accurate term), since they saw slavery not as an oppressive system, but as a sort of welfare institution. Nobody in his right mind would have himself as a slave 19th century USA. Likewise, no one would have sold their children into slavery. This shows that Biblical slavery or serfdom was vastly different from USA slavery. Moreover, the lives of the serfs was protected by the Bible, as opposed to the lives of the American slaves, which depended entirely on the will of the masters. Moreover, Christianity has always been a driving force behind abolitionist movements, from ancient Rome to our own times (slavery is still commonplace in the Middle East and Christian groups are among the few that fight against it). Anyway, I believe that this movie is crap because it shows only one side of the story and completely neglects the other, while positing as a historically accurate depiction of American slavery."
"First of all, I'd like to say, sorry to the other movies nominated for movie of the year that lost to this horrid piece of propaganda bull. You were all wrongfully denied, by reviewers that gave it the movie of the year nomination without even seeing it. As the popular saying goes with this movie now: ""You're a racist if you don't like this movie"".Well, if that is the case, call me a racist. The movie itself had promises of telling an accurate portrayal of a free victim who had his freedom taken away; from his family and everything he has ever known. There was some glimmering promises that could have made this a decent movie, but as soon as those events happened, the propaganda would start over again; ruining the original point given.The acting by the supporting cast is at best lackluster. They acted as if every white person in this movie was hell bent on torturing blacks or was just a complete moron; unaware of what was going on around the time. A fact that was never mentioned in the movie either; over 80% of the population in the south never owned a slave. I guess they wanted to portray the 20% as the majority.The first owner of Solomon was portrayed as supposedly a 'good man', but obviously lacked of any intelligence. Even with the unbelievable sophistication and knowledge Solomon showed, the owner still would not believe he was anything but a slave when Solomon told him he was not. I don't know if it was the overacting of Solomon's character or what, but there is no way a pure slave during that time period would possess those abilities; let alone having someone dumb enough not to notice that fact. And don't even get me started that the slave owner was doing him a 'favor' by sending him off to an owner that was referred to as a 'slave breaker'.After that, the movie continues to get worse for the next hour or so as it is just basically a white person continuously beating on a black person for one reason or another.Near the end of the movie, Solomon meets a decent white person; but alas he's from Canada (as there is no such thing as a decent white person in the south supposedly...) played by Brat Pitt. He gets Solomon's letter out and eventually the authorities come and free Solomon. The movie ends with a couple lines saying that Solomon goes to trial over the events that happen but loses due to an 'all white congress'.If you want to learn about black history and what happened during the times of slavery, this movie is not the place to go to. Find a proper history book and learn for yourself instead of this director's skewed view of events that transpired then."
"The ending left me very disappointed. It was hardly a closure. You can't just cram injustice and suffering into 2hours and then abruptly finish it with a passing ""mailman"" messiah and slap the audience with a pitiful apology after a long-awaited reunion. I mean yeah but that should not be all to it. Can't we at least have a true ending to make up for that 2 hours of hell? There was no emphasis of raw emotions other than pain. No compassion, curiosity and worry from the family's perspective (i.e. Running, screaming, hugging, closeup shot on Solomon's face, showing apparent tears and a genuine smile). Despite it being a very brutal situation, it doesn't touch me at all because the movie doesn't show anything besides suffering... Too scared to show any happiness. Just constant pain, anger, and hurt. When in truth that's not realistic. He must've made temporary friends during that 12 years with little joys here and there - which were not included to guarantee maximum agony. Perhaps in the hope that audience will sympathise better but no, it does the opposite. You see I did not watch this movie because I enjoy sadism but that's about all this movie had to offer. If you're going to touch the subject of slavery at least make it educative and inspiring. Some love at the end, some countermeasure, changes, revolutionary movement, true liberty.. would've completed this film. If you're looking for a moving beautiful art, no you won't find it here. Stay away because this title really has nothing other than sadism that would leave you feeling absolutely terrible.Though it does make me think: Why does it matter so much that Solomon was a free black man? Held up high like a status, like he is better than the other black slaves. And yes he was and the movie insinuates that so many times, when truly every person should be EQUALLY free. And that *should* be the message. But it wasn't. Rubs me the wrong way. Oh yeah Bass said some great stuff but ultimately we never saw our main character living up to those quotes. Solomon didn't give a dang about slavery until he became one himself. And this was never corrected. """"We live in hierarchy. Some people are less and more than you. If you have the privilege, flaunt it and own your rights! Who cares about those below you!"""" They chose what to display and they don't wanna show you any character development nor progress, just the bad stuff. ""The audience can think for themselves"" HAHA this is a movie review not interpretation review. The film stands for itself and it's an incomplete one. Could've been much better."
"Greetings again from the darkness. Should this be labeled a historical drama? Is it one man's extraordinary tale of strength and survival? Does this fall into the ""art film"" category that so divides the movie-going public? The answer to all is YES, and I would add that it's a masterfully crafted film with exquisite story telling, stunning photography and top notch acting throughout.The movie is based on the real life and writings of Solomon Northrup, a free man who was kidnapped and sold into slavery from 1841-53. Northrup's story provides us a look inside the despicable institution of slavery. Needless to say, it's a painful and sad process made even more emotional by the work of director Steve McQueen (Hunger, Shame). McQueen takes a very direct approach. Not much is left to the imagination. Torture, abuse, cruelty and misery take up the full screen. The only subtlety comes from the terrific work of Chiwetel Ejiofor as Northrup. His facial expressions and eyes are more powerful and telling than any lines of dialogue could be.You will not find many details from the movie here. This is one to experience for yourself. It lacks the typical Hollywood agenda when it comes to American history. Instead this era is presented through the eyes of a single wronged man and his quest to return to his wife and kids, no matter the inhumane obstacles. We see Paul Giamatti as an emotionless, all-business slave trader. Benedict Cumberbatch is a plantation owner who has a heart, but lacks business savvy. And finally we enter the world of cotton farmer Michael Fassbender, who twists Bible scripture into threats directed at the slaves - his ""property"".Fassbender dives deep into evil to find his character, and along with Ejiofor, Sarah Paulsen (who plays Fassbender's icy wife), and Lupita Nyong'o (who plays slave Patsey, the center of the two most incredible scenes in the film), provide more Oscar worthy performances than any one movie can expect. You will also note Quvenzhane Wallis (as Northrup's daughter) and Dwight Henry (as a slave) in their first appearances since Beasts of the Southern Wild. Other strong support comes from Scoot McNairy, Taran Killam (SNL), Michael K Williams, Alfre Woodward, a nasty Paul Dano, Garret Dillahunt and Adepero Oduye.Steven Spielberg gave us a taste of the holocaust with Schindler's List, but not since the TV mini-series ""Roots"" has any project come so close to examining the realities of slavery. Northrup's story seems to be from a different universe than the charming slaves of Gone with the Wind. I would argue that what makes this watchable (though very difficult) is the focus on Northrup's story. While tragic, his ending actually deflects from the ongoing plight of those not so fortunate. It's a story of a man who states he doesn't wish to merely survive, he wants to live a life worth living.McQueen's direction will certainly be front and center come awards season, as will many of the actors, John Ridley (the screenwriter), Sean Bobbitt (cinematographer) and Hans Zimmer (score). The only question is whether the subject matter is too tough for Oscar voters, who traditionally lean towards projects a bit more mainstream."
"I agree with the last reviewer; I thought the movie was slow and awkward in the flashbacks. It totally omitted any sense of the long years Solomon spent in slavery and how he reconciled himself to it. There was no surprise with the sadism and inhumanity; as far as I am concerned, moreover, it added nothing new to the already tragic picture of slavery in America. It would be more interesting to understand how humanity was able to deal with slavery and why it produced such extraordinary sadism in the white population. The lack of decency was finally resolved with the arrival of Brad Pitt; I found that casting troubling as well."
"This is another version of the movie Pianist. Black man instead of Jewish man, and violin instead of piano. In Pianist, the guy was just hiding through out the movie; in 12 Years Slave, the guy is just waiting for help instead. He waits and does whatever he is told to. He is taking no action, no fight for freedom and more than anything..no helping anyone.I really forced myself to watch the rest of the movie after the first 20-25 minutes. All of the scenes were unsurprising. Giving the Best Picture Oscar to this movie is like giving Peace Nobel to Bush. I think Hollywood will never give up awarding white-slave and Nazi-Jew movies. I wander if they will ever make Jew-Palestinian movie and award it! I have to admit one thing though: The end was very touching. I couldn't hold my tears. But it had to belong to another movie."
"Like the whipping scenes we uncomfortably witness, in 12 Years a Slave the sting comes in the tail. The end titles tell us neither the slave pen manager nor Solomon Northup's kidnappers were punished. Solomon is saved, but that individual justice does not redefine the terrible system. Racism, slavery and savage injustice persist at film's end. Of course, the point is that even after the Civil War, the freeing of the slaves, the Civil Rights Movement and its legal and societal successes, racism and injustice persist. Hardly a major daily newspaper passes without a reminder, whether it's a regressive change in the voters' rights laws or a Florida bully justified in ""standing his ground"" against the unarmed black kid he hunted. 12 Years a Slave reminds us what contemporary America grew out of and where too much of its roots remain. McQueen's film deploys an uncompromising visceral violence that rejects the sentimentality and softened focus of American treatments of that period. There is such violence in the air that steamboat paddles churn up a riot of raucous white water and the boat's furnaces roar infernal. The Southern swamps have an eerie other-worldliness that sets up the ghosts of slavery past as a still haunting presence. Apparently it takes an outsider to cast such an unflinching eye on the subject. To his credit, the physical world and the language seem perfectly realized. No trace of the outsider there, but the work of a director steeped in his subject's world. Perhaps the only false note is producer Brad Pitt appearing as the Canadian who brings Northup salvation. His performance is fine but he can't stop registering as Brad Pitt, who gets to make the film's wisest and most humane and modern speeches. Whether his casting was his or McQueen's idea, it shivers the film's verisimilitude and seems self-congratulatory. Pitt brings Northup's story to the North as outside the narrative he helps bring it to the screen. But that is a minor cavil about a film that's courageous, brilliantly written, scored, directed and performed, and as important a statement to America and the world as we have seen this year.

"This was an awful depiction of the life/times of the era. The plight of the slave was considerable worse. A slave would've never been allowed to act the way this main character would've..the slaves could not speak proper English, let alone command the language enough to effectively insult/manipulate their captives.The ""masters"" were as uneducated and unrefined as their slaves..but they were in control..period. ROOTS was a considerably better depiction of the times.One thing I noticed, is the only emhasise of the time was the reference to both the master and slave. Although it was accurate, the language spoken was of illiterate people..both master and slave. The only ones who had mastered the language were the land owners themselves.I'm so appalled by this thinly veiled attempt to target the white man in general. We must never forget that the north was republican and the south was democrat, who insisted on slavery..which is what the civil war was all about.Appalled...simply appalled.. the acting alone was worth steering clear of this atrocity that claims to represent the horrible times of the era...absolutely appalled.I think I'll watch ROOTS again to regain my perspective of that horrible stain on America's history...because this film accomplished the opposite of what it so blatantly attempted to do."
"Its amazing how a movie like this could win so much Oscars,i don't,i cant even guess why,the movie is the worst ever to me,am thinking maybe it might be because of of that actor but i don't just get it,as for me its a movie,movies like this e.g American hustle & all lord of the rings don't deserve a spot here on IMDb,but there's a saying that a mans food is another mans poison.but why would a movie like this get top ratings it amaze me a lot,too much but if anybody could explain am good with that,its really a tiring movie its a very tiring movie and i really wanna know whats great about it. Got a problem with that contact me via twitter @iamowomizz.."
"This is a terrible film for many reasons and I could go on at length about the over-simplified characterisation, the ""tell-us-something-we-don't-know"" of the story, and the dismal Terance Mallick-style ""extremely lengthy lingering shots must equal something profound"" but none of those things would really matter (it's only a film, right?) except that this nonsense will be viewed by some people as a true reflection of US society. For god'sake, this ridiculous depiction of how the northern states of the US was an idyllic utopia for black people (and only the nasty evil south was racist) is not even true NOW in 2014! Never mind how much this distorts the reality of the early 19th century. You can go to Phildelphia, get on a bus, see the black homeless lying in the street, see how STILL America has not made amends for the abomination that was slavery. Race riots and the fight for equality and end to racism were late 20th century events - and yet this disgraceful garbage sets out to rewrite history and paint the northen states of the USA in an absurdly egalitarian light."
"My vote is not for artistic endeavor or acting ability which is very good, but I am appalled that Hollywood keeps pumping out this shocking style of drama about slavery which keeps re-visiting the old inflammatory indignations of the past era of the US. I am appalled in all my horror of the harshness of the movie and the severity of the beatings scenes. Shame on those who directed, Steve, and shame on those who sought to raise this issue once again. The movie is far from the entertainment i would normally enjoy! Hollywood needs to take a good hard look at itself and ask is this real entertainment? To boot, the screenplay, which may have followed the original story closely or not, is not that remarkable as far as good drama goes. It seems like the Pitt and other have discovered this story and decided to publicize it for whatever their motives, but I for one am quite tired of mediocrity. I think the last best story along the ""slavery line"" I had the pleasure of watching was ""Armistad"". Had i known this was going to be so graphic, i would not have wasted my $20 to fill the pockets of the movie bourgeoisie."
"The most overrated movie of 2013. The movie shows you the psychological horror of slavery with the protagonist not really taking a part in anything. There is no lesson to be learned here, just showing how horrible things were for African Americans at the time. Feels very forced and tedious, and five minutes in it you will know exactly what's gonna happen. Unimaginative or creative at all. I think the director wanted to say: ""Feel pain, cause I said so. I won't take the time to build characters or weave an interesting narrative"". The movie says let's paint everything with a big general brush-which is OK for action movies- but not for a historical drama."
"Whew--I'm sooooo relieved to know that most of the real evils of the Antebellum South can be mostly laid at the feet of evil white women, who are either blind or insanely jealous. And of course it's a relief to know that there were some upright and well-meaning white male plantation owners--isn't it? Even if they did tend to hand out fiddles and keep the shotguns for themselves... Sigh. In a sentence? This movie is long and painful, in more ways than one. Of course it had to be made--and the fact that it needed to wait until 2013 to GET made is a horrific indictment of this country--but we don't have to pretend it's well made. This is an obvious mess, as heavy-handed as...naaah, I won't say it. The characters are each less than one and a half inches deep and Chiwetel Ejiofor is (I hope) going to win an Oscar for breathing through his mouth and looking unhappy and bewildered for over two hours. Much of the film feels like an homage to Quentin Tarentino (and as Django was itself an homage this is a quote of a quote...). I know people PC enough to have sat through it twice--and I know people who ought to be made to watch it more times than that (though, frankly, it might just come to have a numbing effect). It would have made a perfect PBS special. See it, or see part of it, or at least buy a ticket--and read the book, which is of some real historical importance, as is the story itself."
"Go watch this movie if you want to see a bad copycat of Django unchained.Go watch this movie if you want to feel miserable, helpless & restless for 134 minutes.Go watch this movie if you want to feel like beating the s**t out of everything after watching it.Go watch this movie if you would like to see a Bollywood version of a Hollywood movie, where the worst thing on earth has to happen to the Hero.Go watch this movie if you want to celebrate a director whose aim is to make money out of oppressed people.Go watch this movie if you would like to know what Cinema was not meant to be."
"I was so looking forward to this film. I loved Hunger, didn't see Shame, but was expecting this to be outstanding. I will try to express why I felt so underwhelmed by it. I know this is a depiction of the horrors of slavery, but I expected more than that - and that's all I got, relentless and horrific. There was something off and pointless about it. In terms of characterisation, we are shown how Solomon lives with his family as a free man in New York, seemingly oblivious to the plight of slaves. Then he gets kidnapped and spends the next 12 years under sadistic evil masters and has to survive. Then he gets an enlightened Northener to get his freeman papers and rescue him. He is back with his family in the end, but all we get is his relief to be out of that hell. How is that a new angle on slavery? There is a scene early on with Solomon buying a travel case, observed by a slave, but given the context of the film it is a bit of a loose end and not tied properly. In short: Pros: Some of the acting is very good, especially Lupita N. and Michael Fassbender. Some good set pieces, great costumes, production design, sound design. Cons: Too long, story edit all over the place, cinematography OK but no great shakes(considering the stunning locations), too slow and I'd never thought I'd say this - but direction was boring.I attended a Q&A with director, star and DoP, which was a bit inane as well. Director got defensive about criticism of violence. I get his point about portraying the truth about what happened, but add some damn believable story as well please!"
"12 Years a Slave goes straight for the shock effect. Solomon, a supposedly sensitive, intelligent, kind violinist and family-man is captured to be shipped and sold as a slave. In roughly ten minutes the movie shows how good he had it and then how bad it becomes. Meaning you can almost do without anything that comes after that. People trick him with the promise he can play the violin in a circus, he wakes up in cuffs and is beaten relentlessly. He's sold several times. Meanwhile Solomon tries to distinguish himself from fellow slaves in a manner that isn't particularly sympathetic. He's whipped a lot, others are whipped a lot, some die and all is shown very explicitly. Then, in the last 15 minutes or so, Brad Pitt turns up and saves the day. That's basically the whole darn thing in a nutshell. In my opinion the end seems sloppy and rushed. Secondly - and most importantly - the story line would've had more meaning to it, if it would've been portrayed with more subtlety and would've been less about going from one beating to the next. It gives the impression this movie is just to shock and provoke, instead of inciting any feelings, or thoughts. If you look at a film like ""La Vita E Bella"", you know even just hints can make one feel misery, heartbreak and despair much stronger than if you spell it out. When a film triggers our imagination, one feels moved and touched, with all the emotions belonging to a certain situation. Unless you want to numb the viewer, instead of getting him/her emotionally involved. In that case, this movie was perfect."
"Story of violence and sadism, which does not reflect historical reality. No one except a few sadists could live like this. In a claustrophobic environment flooded with blood and death. All day and every hour masters at home and their slaves crying and screaming in pain. Every scene the same is weary (heavy). That was not normal, despite the existence of slavery. The first time I saw it, I qualified with a 7 but it was not one to save in the library. The second time I found it worse. Now is a 4.I'm tired of gratuitous violence in movies. Violence in TV or cinema begets violence in real people. So I don't like this movie.Good acting, good sticks. Good movie as propaganda against slavery but Not a movie to watch more than once."
The film was powerful and a Goog Cast but I give it only a 4 there were things that bothered me. There were too many times the camera left a scene to another while audio from the previous scene were still playing. Although being taken and in slavery for 12 years we never got a sense of time passing. He never mentioned today is my birthday or it was X years I was taken and sold into slavery at 90 minutes I think it would have been a good film at 134 Minutes it was torture to watch. It was a good cast and super acting I thought the scenes of whipping and beatings were going to be difficult to watch I did not find them disturbing.
"A few years ago now, Mel Gibson made Passion of the Christ; a film which essentially is one long tale of suffering of Jesus on his way to the cross. It was a film that I found to be as vacuous as pornography and an ordeal to sit through because I lost all feeling for the character as he became little more than the subject for violence. I mention this because I worried that this film would be the same as it is very much an issue film and much has been written about how numbing it is in terms of the content. I decided to watch it anyway, mainly because of the British involvement in the film – a lot of talent here, not least of which is director Steve McQueen.The story is based on the true story of a free man kidnapped into slavery. As a story it is one of interest but mainly it provides a central tangible point for the audience to identify with and to follow. It also gives us the oft-used narrative device of a character seeing things for the first time as we are (see also the rookie cop etc). In this way it works very well because we never really get lost in the violence or brutality of the film and, despite the claims of some, it never made me numb to it and it never felt like it was being overdone for the sake of it – if anything it builds very well so it get progressively harder to process. The film shows the extent of the system much better than just a series of beatings; it shows that even ""good"" men are part of it, it shows that the options are zero and it shows that it is a world that has no edges – even though we know that Solomon is just a matter of distance from his rightful freedom, we never really feel that way at all because it is never escaping one place or one person.The story is well told to keep close to Solomon while also letting us see the reality and McQueen is excellent as director in how he shows it. In Hunger and Shame he sits back from his subjects in a rather detached but invasion way. It is hard to describe but long, wide shots leave us to observe simple scenes and often the simpler they are the more telling – as Solomon hangs while others go about their business, we understand the reality of this world and how utterly trapped everyone is – again, it is a system, this is just how it works. The relationship with Bobbitt continues to pay dividends because visually the film is stunning, great colors and great shots whether they be unflinching close-ups or wide and long. The use of music is good too – there is no sentimentality to it and when it is used it is subtle. This is not a film that overdoes the violence to hype it, but nor is a film that pulls on the heartstrings – it feels very factual and very realistic within the context of the system, so while the audience flinch at a particular brutal scene, the film itself does not – because this is how it is in the world we are in.The cast give very good performances in support of this goal, so while some of them are basic roles, the people give good presence and don't ham it up. In particular Ejiofor gets the balance right, his desperation and horror is pushed down as much as he can because of how the system he is in works, but he engages and moves throughout. Fassbender likewise walks the line – he is never a pantomime villain but he is still cruel and hateful. Supporting roles from Nyong'o, Dano, Williams and many others is roundly very good with only one misstep which is Pitt, which is a shame – his face is almost too famous and breaks the ensemble feel, plus the virtue of his character also makes his casting in that specific role seem a little bit like a vanity casting for a producer. This is a minor thing though, since he himself is not bad, but anyway the rest of the cast are convincing and engaging.12 Years a Slave looks like it will be just another Oscar-baiting slavery film, but it is much better than that to be fair the awards hype sullies it a little bit. It is absorbing and brutal in its convincing and detached portrayal of this world, complete with strong performances it is a memorable experience and very well made film."
"Just watched this true story of slavery with my movie theatre-working friend. It depicts the abduction of Soloman Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) from his family in New York State to the bayous of Louisiana (my home state) where he is made a slave. Director Steve McQueen does a fine job depicting how harrowing the experience is and provides catharsis when the ending comes. He also does a nice job of providing some background of other fellow slaves like that of the doomed Patsy. If anyone who paid to see this expected to watch Brad Pitt in a big role, they must have been disappointed to see him in only a couple of scenes but he does well in those and I have to assume most of the public was enthralled by the story to not even care by that point. Anyway, I highly recommend 12 Years a Slave if you want to be challenged as a viewer by the way someone is depicted as the main character is here. Oh, and nice shots of the Louisiana locations."
"We decided to see ""12 Years a Slave"" after it won the Academy's Best Picture award. I cannot express how disappointed we were. Neither the directing, the acting, nor the story itself were even close to Best Picture quality. It was slow, wooden and full of clichés. Chiwetel Ejiofor's acting was nothing special; I got tired of his perpetually pained expression filling the screen. Why didn't he age or grow thinner? Did they have to portray all slave owners as sadistic? And that final scene was so painfully stiff and staged it seemed as though the director and screen writer just ran out of energy. We were just glad to see it end! Clearly this weak film was honored for political reasons, not artistic. Shame on the Academy."
"There is no doubt that the makers of this film wanted it to be as true to life as possible. There is also probably no doubt that what was shown on screen was toned down from what probably happened in real life.Well I have say it I found it to be more than uncomfortable viewing, it was horrific to see the portrayal of man's inhumanity to man. If you can't stomach such portrayals don't go. I walked out after half an hour as I couldn't bear to see any more of it. On that basis, I'm not sure how successful this film will be. I wouldn't recommend anyone to see it. Read the book instead if you want to know what happened."
"Do tell, how can one hate a film if one does not see it to the end? It's not like this was Legally Blonde 2, you needed to get a bit involved. Like actually watch, soak up, ask questions and interpret, not be force fed the filmmakers intentions. This was not a kids movie, so why be simple?Furthermore, how can one not see how this film was structured around fear and not hatred? It so clear how it was showcasing fear, but I guess some need narration. Even more - why do white people today take slavery so personal? I'm white and not once did I familiarise myself with anybody but Solomon, because he was the main character, the one i was suppose to be involved with. Does his skin really mean we won't feel the same in similar situations? This movie is impeccable to say the least. So after viewing I thought ""If a reviewer hated this film, what were the reasons?"" Needless to say I was disappointed in the response. There are many, non-personal, reasons to hate a film. The lack of thought in terms of film leads me to believe that the haters are actually just racist. Not because they would do similar stuff to a black person but because they needed to see white people not be SO evil. Their logic for hating it was not based on film, it just was not. There is one long shot, where he hangs in the tree. He hangs for a while holding himself up with his neck and toes. The other workers slowly come out and carry on. This is because the film is about fear. His peers did not help him because of fear. Mistress Eps only beat Patsy, why? Fear. Fear that Patsy meant more to her husband than she. Ford was too scared to help a man he knew should be helped. Edwin Eps was scared of loosing his power. And all the slaves are scared on the most basic principle - they could die. The beating was relentless - but I believe it to be. If a person is going to strip a woman and lash her then why would he suddenly develop a moral compass and say ""Only three lashes?"" Im sure that compass was broken to begin with. ""It was difficult to sit through"" well I am sure it was even more difficult to live through... my goodness, at least we only had to experience it for two hours, not twelve years - with a drink and snack no less.""It was one sided, depicting black as good and white as evil"" it did? I am pretty sure I witnessed Solomon loose it a few times although confined to his circumstances. When Solomon refused to take his shirt off for a beating and stood up for himself, he could have just taken the whip away instead he beat him. Inflicting that kind of pain is not being the better person.And, from one reviewer's opinion to another - I believe this film is leaps and bounds better than ""Citizen Kane"", ""Paths of Glory"", ""M"", ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""Amadeus"", ""2001-A Space Odyssey"", or ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" but, an opinion of how great a film is can usually be explained by how old the viewer is when they first saw it. And all mentioned were screened before my birth, so excuse the lacklustre feeling towards the oldies.It deserves accolade in the history books of film.""12 Years a Slave"" was relentless in making me feel, and I adore the film for taking me to such emotional depths - even if I probably won't sit through it again."
"On the movie: Tedious monotonous slow boring gore fest that could have been easily made into a great epic movie. All Solomon did after his release would be a much more fruitful script than the ridiculous non- substance matter discarded for hours... and I mean tedious heavy hours.On Brad Pitt: Where did he come from? What was he doing there? It could be anybody else playing such role, even an empty bottle of water, but it was in fact more of a ridiculous fallacious cameo than a proper star acting quality.On people who rated it over 4: It had loads of nothingness... I give you that, and nothingness is Hollywood's recent attitude towards success. I believe that when you walk the red carpet towards the Oscars, this movie will face a bipolar crowd as its best crowd possible."
"The director promised authenticity, but he didn't deliver it. I have seen slavery movies again and again and this one has to be the most inauthentic one ever. The acting was inauthentic. Ejiofor disappointed me. I have seen great actors acting a role and I have to say, Ejiofor doesn't even come close.***SPOILER***The scene when he finds himself in shackles: he couldn't act like he was actually a captured individual, about to be sold into slavery. This guy looked like a 2013 man paid to pretend to be a captured slave. That's not authenticity.Also, why was he made to appear as if he was a passive observer in his story? What's up with that McQueen? He looked like he was just standing by while things went on with other people. Go home and watch There Will Be Blood and tell me if Daniel Day-Lewis' character was a passive observer. Also, was there any character study done? Because if they say there was, I wouldn't believe it. Watching it, I could tell it was a movie. Good movies look so real that you can't tell it's a movie. Perfect example of a slave movie that looks real, Goodbye Uncle Tom. Go watch it now and compare it to 12 Years a Slave. Hell, even watch Django Unchained and compare it to this one and you'll say Django is better.Which brings me to white people. White people probably gave this movie great reviews because it was so tame. I bet when they heard that another slavery movie was being released, they shook in their seats at huffington post or san francisco chronicle. I bet they thought this movie was going to expose all the wrongs of slavery in a way that makes Django Unchained look like Mickey Mouse. Well, it didn't.All the bad things about slavery are hidden in this movie. **Spoiler** The rape scene looks more like a sex scene. The hanged people are unseen. And torture is so weak. True, they show whippings, but that was the least of it during slavery. They hid too much from us in this movie and that's why white people loved such a mediocre movie.If you like a nice, tame movie which doesn't even put the main character at the forefront of the plot, you'll love 12 Years a Slave. If you're a movie enthusiast who loves a deep, emotionally challenging picture like Boys Don't Cry or Monster or more recently Fruitvale Station, then you'll hate this movie."
