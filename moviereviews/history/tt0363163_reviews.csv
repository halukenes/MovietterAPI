"I teach a college course on WWII, in graduate school studied under several experts on the subject and have interviewed numerous survivors on both sides. This film comes out on top, perhaps the finest ever made on the subject of the war (though the Belorussian ""Come and See"" & ""Schindler's List"" are darn close as well).I had the remarkable experience of watching this film last night with two veterans, one a GI who fought from Omaha to Czechoslovakia. . .and a German infantry officer, a veteran of four years on the Eastern Front. The German, who met Hitler several times, within minutes was exclaiming over the historical accuracy, right down to ""Hitler's"" lower class Munich accent. . .something an American audience would never pick up on. My German friend, who at the end of the war was in East Prussia, in the debacle of attempting to evacuate over a million civilians ahead of the Russians, was profoundly shaken by the film. . .saying the horror, the hospital scenes, the utter chaos, the lynchings, the sight of 12 year old children fighting. . .all of it was real. And an interesting observation by him. . .he had no idea Berlin, at the end, had been as bad as what he witnessed along the Baltic coast and is still haunted by. It truly was ""Gotterdammerung"" for an entire nation and this film brings it frightfully close to you. If you are a parent of small children, the terrifying ending for the Goebbel's children is an absolutely searing nightmare.I think the most important point of the film was the portrayal of Hitler. . .not as the stereotyped raving madman, usually overplayed like a bad performance of King Richard, but far more subtle. I've talked with many who knew Hitler, including a childhood playmate of Helga, Goebbel's oldest child, and all will tell you that Hitler could be absolutely charming, focused on you, even courtly when with women. The terror is, that even as the actor shows us that ""human"" side, in his soft voice he is dictating orders, observations, and comments of absolute evil. The true form of evil rarely looks evil on the surface, it seduces us with a fair face as it leads, sometimes an entire nation, into damnation. THis film captured that evil.My German friend's comment at the end of the movie. . .""I still can not believe we fought for that monster for six years."" A history professor at Montreat College"
"This film definitely is a must-see because of the incomparable degree of realism displayed in it. Direction, camera and acting are of an unparalleled level and make you, as the viewer, feel as if you are actually in Berlin, 1945, and in the FÃ¼hrer's bunker. The film does not provide any commentary or judgment, it just shows facts.The film is criticized because it gives the Nazi's a human face, but this is exactly it's strongest point: the Nazi's were not extraterrestrial monsters, they were as human as you and I. The image of Hitler crying of sorrow because all is lost, is still burned on my retina.In my opinion, this is a film that should be shown in schools to illustrate the Second World War with. It is probably impossible to provide a more realistic account, without *any* form of judgment.A major achievement, even for Germany as a whole. It is very brave to create such a realistic film about one's own past."
"""Der Untergang"" is certainly the most impressive, depressive and realistic dramatic movie about the World War II ever made. I have never seen a film picturing the insanity of Hitler in his very last days in a bunker in Berlin with his high command, and how the German people were hypnotized by him like in this film. Last year, I saw the deceptive, boring, pretentious and overrated ""Molokh"", showing a caricature of Hitler and Eva Braun in Bavaria. But ""Der Untergang"" is awesome and comparable to ""Apocalypse Now!"", my favorite movie of war.Two years ago, I saw the powerful ""Das Experiment"" and I was impressed with the work of Oliver Hirschbiegel. With ""Der Untergang"", this director is certainly included in my list of favorite directors. It is difficult to highlight one actor or actress in this constellation of stars, but I was impressed with the performance of Bruno Ganz and his ""human"" Hitler, totally different from the stereotypes usual in other movies. The cinematography and the battles are stunning, and the scenario of Berlin completely destroyed recalled the neo-realistic movie of Roberto Rossellini ""Germania Anno Zero"".For those who know Germany and German people, it is amazing to see how this wonderful country survived to the chaos, destruction and lack of command, arrived from the ashes like Phoenix and sixty years later is again one of the greatest nations. For those who might have believed in Hitler and his Nazi Party, it is impressive to see how people is forgotten and treated without compassion by their leader in his last hours. And for those who love war, I really recommend to watch this magnificent anti-war movie, and see the behavior of the leaders and population when a war is lost. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""A Queda! As Últimas Horas de Hitler"" (""The Fall! The Last Hours of Hitler"")"
Der Untergang makes you live the horrors and craziness of war. Bruno Ganz's interpretation of Adolf Hitler is worthy of an Oscar. He is completely believable. Also the rest of the cast performs admirably. You feel transported to Berlin as it was bombarded by the Russians. You get a very clear insight (or an impression?) in how the military decisions were taken during those final days of the war. The movie balances well between large-scale effects of bombs exploding in ruined streets and depictions of different persons going though the experience  from Hitler and his staff in the well-protected bunkers to the principal military commanders torn between reason and loyalty and German civilians trapped in an inferno. The movie is neither pro-Nazi nor does it depict all Nazis as mindless monsters. It gives an impression of utter realism. Go see it in a good cinema  your seat will tremble as the bombs explode. A nine out of ten.
"In recent years, war films have given a new exposure to the sheer nature of war. In ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""Black Hawk Down"" and ""Born on the Fourth of July,"" we were exposed to the realities that a soldier endures not only on the battlefield, but what they take with them long after the battles end. However, ""Downfall,"" a German film nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2005 Oscars, brings a unique perspective to the table. It is about the last days of Hitler and the Third Reich and the ultimate demise of both. More so than a war movie, this feature exposes the insanity of Hitler and the blind faith of his followers at the end. It is a deeply disturbing, intimate portrait of the cruelty that he inflicted not only upon 6 million Jews, but ultimately on his own countryman at the end.Based on the book ""Inside Hitler's Bunker"" by Joachim Fest, ""Downfall"" is in a word, shocking. The last act in the great horrific play of the Third Reich plays out like that of a cultso many men and woman who swore allegiance to Hitler commit suicide by either shooting themselves in the head or by ingesting poison capsules. But the madness of Hitler himself is horrifically captivating. He changes his mind and opinion on a whim. One moment he advises his SS-Guards and Generals to leave the city after learning that he does not have enough troops to protect Berlin. A particular one named Gruppenführer Hermann Fegelein , who was Eva Braun's brother-in-law, takes the Fuhrer for his word and leaves Berlin. When Hitler realizes this, he denounces Fegelein and orders him executed. What is more, Hitler discusses the final demise of the German people. He explains that this failure is not only that of the military, but of the civilians themselves. As such, his soldiers do not protect the people from the coming onslaught of the Soviet Army. He advises, ""In a war as such there are no civilians."" Hitler is recreated by the superlative performance of Bruno Ganz, who appeared in the 2004 remake of ""The Manchurian Candidate."" Ganz captures the movement, voice, even the involuntary shaking of Hitler's left hand so well, that the audience would feel as if they are watching the dictator himself. We are often left with shivers down our spine at how realistic Ganz's depiction is. Surprisingly enough, Thomas Kretschmann, who played the Nazi captain that gave Wladyslaw Szpilman a coat and food in ""The Pianist"" is seen here as Fegelein. I first noticed Kretschmann as a German U-Boat commander in 2000s, ""U-571."" He is a remarkable actor who brings with him a demanding presence on the screen through his stern looks and ultimate resolve. Unfortunately my knowledge of Eva Braun other than Hitler's mistress is limited. So it was refreshing to see a film that revealed her. Based on ""Downfall's"" depiction, Braun, portrayed by Juliane Kohler, was either one of the shallowest individuals I have ever seen, or she was so blinded by her faith in Hitler that she disregarded almost any sense of reality. For example, during Berlin's first days of bombardment, she becomes bored with being in the bunker and orders a party in an above ball roomnot surprisingly during that party a shell lands nearby and blows out windows in the room. Secondly, during later heavy bombardment, realizing that she will commit suicide with Hitler, she writes a letter to a relative where she states what jewelry she will leave behind. She is simply detached from reality and lost in the fanatical jargon of the Fuhrer. Certainly the film's most disturbing instances occur when Magda and Joseph Goebbels poison their children in the name of the Fatherland. One of their children, a girl probably about 10 years old, has a dim understanding of what is happening and refuses to take the drink given. She is then forced to drink it by her mother and a guard. Later on, Magda would come into her children's room while they were asleep and would give them the final capsule to eliminate them. ""Downfall"" is certainly one of the most powerful film's I have ever seen. As stated above, Hitler and his followers played out their existence as if they were in a cult. The blind faith of his followers and the insanity of the man are so well realized by director Oliver Herschbiegel, that it changes one's perception from that of simply being history to that of realism. These events happened less than a century ago and although most have learned to forgive Germany's past, no one will ever forget it. It is the stigma that haunts this generation of German youth because many of their grandparents or great-grandparents were a part of one of history's most infamous armies. But the fact that this film is German was surprising to me. I would have guessed that no one in Germany would have wanted to dig up their past in this way. However, if one looks at this film as closure to Germany's transgressions, then maybe this new generation of German youth can learn to have a sense of national identity without the horrors of the past seen in their shadows. **** out of ****"
"Not since perhaps Rod Steiger's portrayal of Benito Mussolini in Moustapha Akkad's LION OF THE DESERT (1980) have I seen a notorious dictator more realistically acted than Bruno Ganz's stunning display as ""Der Fuerer"" in The Downfall (2004).Sitting amongst a full-house of patrons here at the Toronto Int'l Film Festival's 2004 edition, Ganz captivated the local audience with the scariest Hitler I've ever seen up on the silver screen -- better than Noah Taylor's English Hitler in MAX just a couple of years back.Audience members get a glimpse into the final days of Hitler's rule from the bunker deep beneath the Reich Chancellery in Nazi Berlin's dying days. The defeated spirit of the Nazis -- covered extensively in the history books -- has seldomly been more penetratingly shown on the Big Screen. Bravo to director Oliver Hirschbiegel for doing this the right (German) way -- for intrepidly tackling a period piece few German producers might.I'd had a chance to chat with the actors post-screening, with lead actress Alexandra Maria Lara (playing Traudl Junge) candidly admitting the sheer amount of work she'd diligently invested in bringing her character to life -- doubtless complicated by the death of Frau Junge in 2002. Her research, however, was clearly impeccable and left no stone unturned. Corinna Harfouch wasn't on hand -- as Magda Goebbels. Pity because in many respects, she convincingly stole the show. So rarely do we see Hitler on screen in modern days to allow us a glimpse into the horrifying nature of a madman bent on global domination. We all know the end of this story, but seldom does a film so masterfully suspend your disbelief than does The Downfall in making you wonder just how the Third Reich might end. Historical fiction might never be the same."
"This magnificent film goes where no one else dared to go to show us the last days of Adolf Hitler. The director, Oliver Hirshbiegel, working with a big cast, brings to life the madness of the last days of the monster, as observed by a young and impressionable secretary who witnessed most of the crisis.At the beginning of the film we watch as five young women are brought to be interviewed by Hitler for a job as his personal secretary. Young Traudl Junge is selected. She is a pretty woman who is naive in many ways and probably had no inkling about the trip she was going to embark.The film captures the tragic figure of Hitler as everything is caving in on him and his grand plans for victory. We watch a man at the beginning of the film that is still thinking he is in command of the German forces, but his authority has eroded, as it becomes clear to the people under him the war is lost and it will be a matter of time before they are defeated.We watch the life of privilege the higher ups led inside the bunker. It was a fortification in which all comforts the regular Germans could not imagine existed. We get to know the people in Hitler's inner circle. The Goebbels, both Joseph and Magda, supporters of the regime, maintain the loyalty to the Fuhrer until the end. The scene where Magda Goebbels murders her children is hard to take and we keep sinking in our seats, as we can't believe such cruelty existed. In her narrow view of things, Magda must take her family with her to a death these children didn't deserve.The film is totally dominated by Bruno Ganz. As Hitler, he makes us see this man as he probably was in real life. Mr. Ganz's uncanny resemblance with Hitler is what makes the film works the way it does. At times, Mr. Ganz is totally irrational, and at times, he is presented as a lost man who can't see what he has done to Germany and to Europe and the world.As Traudl Junge, the young secretary, Alexandra Maria Lara gives a subtle performance. She saw plenty inside the bunker and lived to tell it to the world. The other excellent performance is given by Corinna Harfouch, who as Mrs. Goebbels makes us cringe in horror because of what she is capable of doing. Juliane Kohler, as Eva Braun, is an enigma. At times, she is presented as a carefree young woman who might have loved Hitler. Yet, we don't ever know what made this Eva Braun tick. Ulrich Matthes as Joseph Goebbels and Heino Ferch as Albert Speer are equally effective playing these two men.The director and his team have to be congratulated for taking us on a voyage to see the last moments of the Third Reich."
"'Der Untergang' is probably the only WW2 movie I've ever seen, which only deals with facts and is utterly deprived of any form of commercialism whatsoever. Bruno Ganz is truly excellent in his role as Adolf Hitler, a tired man who sees his ""Reich"" fall, but cannot accept it. Overall (type)casting is very good; all the actors chosen to portray a famous/notorious character look a lot like the real deal, especially Goebbels. Although I'm not a fan of long war movies, these 2,5 hours passed very quickly due to excellent acting, great sets, FX and storyline. Somehow, every scene is dripping with underlying tension that never really explodes; a kind of unsettling unbelieved grips you when you see seemingly ordinary people commit astonishing atrocities and sins towards mankind, just for their faith and loyalty to one man, Hitler, who himself walks the edge of reason.Great movie : 10/10 without a doubt."
"I don't know what to say about this film. I am almost speechless.First of all, this is almost PERFECT cinema, beautifully shot, acted, lit, staged and on and on. BUt it is also the only film in recent memory that had an almost physical impact on me. I left feeling disoriented and very disquieted, a feeling that lasted for several hours.What we have here is an exercise in patience. A film that allows us to watch the disintegration of the largest empire in modern history, from the inside out. Beginning after the start of the siege of Berlin, the bulk of the film takes place in the cramped bunkers below the city, where Hitler and his officers are trapped like rats on a sinking ship, aware of their fate, but not smart enough, not willing enough, or maybe incapable of escaping the fates they created for themselves.This is a daring, brilliant film with a virtuoso performance by Bruno Ganz as Hitler. He shows us that beneath the genocidal, world changing shell of hatred that the globe knew, Hitler was still that petty, hatefilled, failed art-student that he was before becoming the greatest villain in history.awesome, awesome, awesome movie."
"Downfall is the gripping depiction of the last few days of the Second World War in Europe, as the Russians advance into Berlin and approach ever nearer the bunker of Adolf Hitler who still believes their advance can be stopped...Bruno Ganz turns in a terrific performance as Hitler, paying great attention to detail (including the regional accent and the effects of Parkinson's disease) that really make him into a believable person which is a lot more frightening to watch than the usual two-dimensional characterisations that are usually seen on screen. Ganz manages to dominate the screen with the same effectiveness that allowed Hitler to get followers of such devotion that despite his atrocities and the horror of the situation many are prepared to stay with him and fight to the death while the possibility of escape or surrender remains open to them. He is almost schizophrenic - at some moments he is almost gentle, such as some of the scenes with his secretary, then shortly afterwards he is practically foaming at the mouth in his contempt for the civilian population of Berlin who he will not raise a finger to try to save by surrendering to the Allies.The other actors are not very well known - at least on the international arena, but this added greatly to the authentic feel. Some of the senior Nazi leaders are hardly more sympathetic than their Fuhrer - Himmler in particular shows only personal ambition while pretending loyalty. Other characters such as the caring SS doctor who finds elderly patients simply abandoned in a hospital or the father who desperately tries to persuade his son who must be around 12-14 not to get involved and perish in a hopeless cause are succinctly realised.The film is expertly shot, with the unreal atmosphere in the bunker captured perfectly where Hitler raves about army units that barely or cease to exist coming to the rescue of the Reich and orders oilfields re-captured for 'long distance missions' when the Russian troops are barely a few hundred metres away.There is no glory shown in the battle scenes as the outcome is always a foregone conclusion making the resulting deaths even more moving. Watching young children and old men trying to hold off the Russian advance with inadequate weaponry is tragic in the knowledge that they are dying for no real purpose other than the whims of a handful of madmen.Very few films have depicted the tragic waste of life that war provokes better than Downfall and this turns out to be one of the best movies concerning the conflict that claimed over 50 million lives."
"All I can say about ""Der Untergang"" is: WOW! This is one of those rare films that prove that the darkest pages in our world history easily surpass the fiction tales of the most imaginative fantasist. This soon-to-be landmark in cinema portrays the final ten days of Hitler's reign at the well hidden bunker in Berlin. In the opening sequences, we see how the Führer hires Traudl Junge (flawless performance by Alexandra Maria Lara) as his personal secretary and we largely witness the rest of the story from her viewpoint. Recent documentary footage with the real Junge is showed to audience at the end of the movie, stressing even more that this is a very intelligent and carefully elaborated production. A form of criticism I often encountered stated that Hitler was portrayed too ""human"" by the Swiss actor Bruno Ganz. Let me tell you that people who claim this haven't got the slightest clue what they're talking about! It's true that Hitler sometimes strokes his dogor even gives a compliment to his servant for cooking him such a lovely dinner! But only moments after, you're exposed to the real Hitler again! Alternately a mad-raving dictator, a disillusioned conqueror or simply a pathetic old man. But perhaps the most astonishing scenes in ""Der Untergang"" are the ones in which the persons close to Hitler  either professional or amicable  remain unconditionally loyal to him! It is deeply disturbing to behold how so many people blindly swear by the unworldly beliefs of a madman, even prepared to follow him into death. This accurate portrait results in a series of brilliant sequences with the severely shocking fate of the Goebbels family as an absolute highlight.Purely talking in terms of cinema, ""Der Untergang"" comes dangerously close to perfection as well. The largest part of this film exists out of interior shots, more specifically the bunker-network where Hitler lasted his final days and eventually committed suicide. And the atmosphere inside this bunker is reflected on the movie-screen as genuine as humanly possible. You can nearly smell the fear of the lower-ranked officers! You can almost feel the shivering of the petrified secretaries! I really hate using a cliché sentence like this butit's trueit's like you are there yourself! And you don't want to be there! Even the totally demolished streets of Berlin looks look more appealing than the claustrophobic Nazi bunker. This despicable chapter in history deserves an accurate and well-budgeted cinema version, if only just for passing on the inglorious stories of WWII to younger generations. Director Oliver Hirschbiegel terrifically turned Joachim Fest's novel into a mesmerizing film experience. Perhaps the most praiseworthy aspect about it all is that ""Der Untergang"" simply is a reconstruction of the facts! No lame and amateurish attempts to blame Hitler's actions on miserable childhoods or traumatizing experiences. Simply put: this is fundamental viewing!"
"Considering the fact how hard it is to make an adequate movie about the  Third Rich and especially Hitler himself, ""Der Untergang"" is a superb  portrayal of the last days of Hitler, his minions and the Third Rich.  First of all, Bruno Ganz' performance is magnificent, brilliant,  perfect. You're beginning to think he IS the Fuehrer, his look, his  mannerism, his sick philosophy of life and his downfall are absolutely convincing. After seeing him you can finally understand why  so many people back then were attracted by his charisma, but thanks to  Ganz' performance you do not forget about the terrible crimes he  committed by his followers and about the evil inside the sick soul of  this man. His minions weren't that important in this movie, except for  Joseph Goebbels and his family. Heinrich Himmler, the ReichsfuehrerSS,  was portrayed as the man he was: an idiotic coward, who was in great  part responsible for the Holocaust and still believed in a peace  agreement with the allied forces, although this idea was completely out  of place. Albert Speer as one of the less criminal national socialists  was also quite good interpreted. Martin Bormann, Alfred Jodl and  Wilhelm Keitel, 3 other important Nazis, got too few screen time, and  Hermann Goering didn't even show up, he was just mentioned. I think  Goebbels wasn't portrayed that authentic as he could have, due to the  fact he was the most intelligent of Hitler's inner circle, but in some  scenes he seemed like someone who could just repeat his own slogans.  The part about Traudl Junge and the boy from the Volkssturm, Peter, was  also quite good, but it was clearly overshadowed by the Hitler/ minion  part. There are also some surprisingly well done battle- sequences  taking place in Berlin, in which you can also see a part of the pretty  high amount of blood and violence, for example when a soldier gets shot  through his head, some officers are committing suicide or the killing  of the Goebbels children, a scene which gave me the chills. Due to it's  high authenticity, great actors and an important message, this movie  could become as important as Schindler's List already is, in order to  show today's youth the insanity of Hitler and the whole Third Rich and  to make them avoid racist and extreme right wing organisations. All in  all, this is one of the best German flicks I've ever seen - although  there isn't such a huge number of good German movies. 10/10"
"Truly great movies are few and far between these days; but Der Untergang most definitely represents one of those rare occasions. Oliver Hirschbiegel, who brought us the wonderful 'Das Experiment' has produced a film that is very nearly perfect. Depicting the final ten days of Hitler and the National Socialist regime, Der Untergang or 'The Downfall' to give it it's English title is an expose of failure and the way that a madman can bend a whole nation into doing his bidding. The film is very realistic, and an excellent ensemble cast breathe life and believability into the roles of the various members of the Nazi party and because every performance is picture perfect, the whole thing comes together brilliantly as one whole piece. Bruno Ganz gives the central performance as the Fuhrer himself and it is one of the greatest performances I've ever seen in a film. His portrayal of Hitler in the middle of his downfall is absolutely perfect, and Ganz excellently portrays the man's every emotion. It must be difficult to play such a notorious character as Hitler himself, but Ganz rises to the occasion and gives it his all.It is not the acting or the realism that is Der Untergang's main claim to greatness, however - it's the double meaning behind every scene. Each one is perfectly composed, and all the time you're watching you can not only see what's happening on screen but also take note of the implications surrounding it. Through every scene, there's always the notion that a nation is falling. That's another thing that's great about this movie - the way that it manipulates the audience into an awkward situation. On the one hand, we know that Hitler and the Nazi regime were unspeakably evil; but while we're watching this almost great nation crumble around it's leader, it is hard to watch without feeling some sympathy for the country, in spite of the ideals that were preached. I thought it would be impossible to generate feelings for the Nazi's; but Der Untergang has managed even that. 'The Downfall' is an apt title for this movie, as aside from depicting an important event in history; the film is fundamentally about failure. The entire movie focuses on one man's huge downfall, and it is both a heartbreaking and powerful cinematic experience. Der Untergang is not to be missed."
"""Der Untergang"" (""The Downfall"") portrays life inside (and to an extent outside) the ""Führerbunker"" in Berlin during the last few weeks prior to Hitler's suicide in April, 1945. The screenplay was written by Bernd Eichinger, who has had previous experience with the adaptation of historical material for cinema, and done a commendable job in the process. I am, of course, referring to his screen version of Umberto Ecco's historical novel ""The Name of the Rose (1986). Some of Eichinger's other credits include ""Body of Evidence"" (1993, which he co-produced) and ""The NeverEnding Story"" (1984, as producer).Few movies have stirred up as much controversy even before their release, as has ""Der Untergang."" So what was all the fuss about, and was it warranted? After all, how many films have been made about Hitler already, including several about Hitler in his Berlin bunker. There is nothing especially controversial about the subject matter per se. What is more, Hirschbiegel and Eichinger appear to have done their homework, basing the film extensively on German historian Joachim Fest's acclaimed book of the same name (2003). Events are portrayed largely through the eyes of Traudl Junge, Hitler's private secretary from 1943when the film opens with a flashback sequence to her job interview and appointmentto his death. Her memoirs, and interviews conducted before her death, constitute a further source for the film. The Führer himself is played magisterially by Bruno Ganz, who clearly spent countless hours studying Hitler's public speeches, as well as rare footage of the private man, not to mention recordings of his voice. For a historian like myself, who has viewed and listened to much of the material myself, it is uncanny how right Ganz gets it. Inflection, tonality, accentthey are all there. As are gestures and body language. This film has to be seen in the original, even if you don't understand German.So if there is little in the way of subject matter, preparation, historical consulting, and prime acting to fault, why then the controversy? The approach and interpretation were at the root of the hullabaloo. Interviewed while the film was in the making, Eichinger explained that he would portray Hitler ""as a man, as a human"" (""wie ein Mensch."") This was revolutionary in cinema, where renditions of the Nazi leader havepre-Eichingerstill not gone far beyond the ""evil-dictator"" approach. You might reasonably query what is wrong with the ""evil dictator"" approach, given the accepted fact that he was, indeed, evil. From a historian's perspective, everything is wrong with that approach, and Eichinger had the courage to transcend it for the broad public.The first two decades of post-World War II historians pretty much demonized Hitler, as did all movies before ""Der Untergang."" This was understandable, at the time. Wounds were still fresh, denazification was under way, Germans were seeking a new democratic identity aligned with the West, and the issue of ""collective guilt"" was touchy. Solid, balanced biographies of Hitler had not yet been written, and historical understanding of how it was possible that a highly cultured people such as the Germans could have been led astray was only just beginning to take shape. But with the 1964 revision of Lord Alan Bullock's ""A Study in Tyranny"" (1st ed. 1952) and Joachim Fest's ""Hitler: Eine Biographie"" (1973) professional historians started putting demonetization to rest and instead began to explain. And this meant accepting the perhaps distasteful tenet that Hitler was, after all, a man, and not some kind of deranged satanic figure from hell. Sir Ian Kershaw, Professor of Modern History at the University of Sheffield, has taken things even further, in his highly accessible two-volume (2000 page!) magnum opus which has now become the standard biography (published 1998-2000). For Kershaw has not only reconciled the internationalist (or ""Hitler-centric"") approach, which focuses on Hitler as linchpin and leader of the Third Reich, without whom World War II and the Holocaust are unthinkable; with the structuralist approach, which links Hitler and his ""enabling"" to social, political and cultural structures in Weimar Germany. Kershaw has also gone a long way towards meeting the desideratum of German historian Martin Broszat, uttered as far back as the 1970s, for the ""historicization"" of Third Reich history, meaning its firm embedding in overall German, European, and indeed World History, rather than its artificial isolation as an ""aberration"" or a ""German special path"" (""deutscher Sonderweg."") This, then, is the proper historiographical context of ""Der Untergang."" In effect, the film almost belatedly follows trends in scholarship that have been developing for some time now. Of course, the general public is hardly aware of such developments. So in a sense, the film is something of a vulgarization, a kind of dramatization informed by the best scholarship. The film does not explain, for it is, after all, not a documentary with the voice-over of a historical consultant cum narrator. That is not its purpose. What it does, however, is provide an excellent sense of Hitler in his declining days, increasingly delusional if perhaps not outright insane, but still ablealmost to the bitter endto maintain a hold on his closest followers. Not to mention the unreality of life in the sheltered bunker, while outside the Russians are advancing through Berlin suburbs, held back only by a pathetic hodge-podge of Hitler youth and tired old men drafted into service in the Volkswehr. From all accounts I have read, from the pens of scholars English, American and German, I can say with a high degree of certitude that this film provides a reasonably authentic recreation of what it must have been like. Or in the words of Leopold von Ranke, ""wie es eigentlich gewesen."" What higher acclaim can a historian provide?"
"Few films have dared to touch WWII objectively from a German point of view; most use the Germans as great villains and Allied forces as great heroes... Movies like ""Patton"" show brief sights into German military thinking while ""The Pianist"" finds a good cultured German officer in a nightmare scenario ""Downfall"" tells the story of the Führer's final hours, his last critical 12 days in a fortified bunker below the Reich Chancellery, while the Soviet Army was slowly taking over Berlin and their artillery bombarding the whole the city Mostly through the eyes of his young Bavarian secretary, Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara) we see the ailing and obviously delusional Führer allowing no negotiation with the Allied forces, raving about how his generals betrayed him, ordering the movement of troops that do not exist, screaming that the German people do not deserve to survive for their apparent treachery and cowardiceBut what has come under criticism is the film's attempt at giving Hitlerwhose face has become symbolic for the epitome of evila compassionate side He's ""Uncle Hitler"" to the children of Josef Goebbles who happily sings for him, so loving for his blonde wife Eva Brown, so kind to his pet dog Blondi, so caring when he awards a young boy (who showed great bravery in the face of the enemy) with a medal and pinches his cheek, and so gentle when he pins a medal on Magda Goebbels for being the 'bravest mother in the Reich'.It's easy to see why the film was nominated for an Oscar in the Best Foreign Film Category It takes you inside the minds of Hitler's faithful, showing you how it was that one infamous man could be so charismatic and magnetic Although his closest advisors, the remaining dedicated members of the Nazi government, know that there is no hope, no one was seen willing to challenge his orders or attempt to seize power And many opted for suicide after living out their final hours in obscene denial, singing and dancing champagne glass in handBut Hitler's dark side is also shown when the film depicts his hate and antipathy for the Jews; when one of the more ""rational"" members of the Nazi hierarchy, Albert Speer (Heino Ferch), stated gently but bluntly to him that the war was lost and he did not follow his orders to destroy the infrastructure in German cities; also when he becomes convinced that Heinrich Himmler (Ulrich Noethen) has betrayed him and must be executed; and when Eva Braun pleads him for her brother-in-law's life, the tormented Hermann Fegelin (Thomas Kretschmann), and he furiously rejected her requestOne of the most horrifying sequences that is unforgettable was that of Magda Goebbles played by Corinna Harfouch It is astonishing to witness how an unstoppable steely mother, with no hesitation or remorse, is capable of such atrocities for a blind and irrational loyalty to a 'charming' monsterGanz's character is equally psychotic and human, capable of shooting even his most loyal followers and utterly believable as Uncle HitlerJuliane Köhler complements Ganz's exceptional performance with her own chillingly fine one as the ultimate blind follower whose loyalty to her Führer never flagged Köhler shows us how she can be drunkenly carefree dancing to swing as bombs and artillery shake the walls of the bunker one day, and in another day applying a fresh coat of red lipstick to her fleshy lips before she takes one cyanide tablet for the man she preferred not to live without""Downfall"" may be considered powerful and historically significant It is a must for history buffs"
"Who better to make a WWII film than the Germans themselves? This is possibly the best WWII film I have seen yet. It is a very intense movie about the final days of Adolf Hitler (a SUPERB roll played by Bruno Ganz, he should get at least one Oscar for this...) which had me coming back to see the movie a second and even a third time (I saw T3 only twice, he he). And not only Bruno Ganz has done a great performance, the entire cast gives it all their best. Very good film indeed.As I said, it's a film about Adolf Hitlers final days, trapped in a bunker in Berlin, while the Russians are slowly moving closer. Hitler losing his faith in a 'good' outcome, the final bullet, everything is has happened for real. But when I left the cinema I had the idea I had just been watching a fictional story. A perfect script, made in real life 59 years ago. Not much to say about anything else. If you are interested in WWII stuff, go see it in the cinema, it's worth every penny."
"I have been fascinated not only by the movie (I have watched this now 10 times) but the divergence of opinion - with some Germans saying it was terrible. This I don't understand. In the West from the time of Charlie Chaplin Hitler was portrayed as a raving lunatic - but to me that does not explain his rise to power. A lunatic could not nearly conquer and enslave half the world. In his early rise to power, he was ridiculed in the West. The fact that this movie gives him some human qualities makes him all the more chilling. There is a dialog between the Junge character and the Braun character that perfectly summarizes Hitler. They talked of the great gulf between the private man and the public man. The Braun character said that she had known the man for 15 years - and yet she knew nothing of him. I believe to truly understand the movie one must also watch the movie with the director's commentary. Everything about this movie - with the exception of 2 things mentioned by the director - (which having just read the spoiler agreement I will refrain from mentioning - everything was based on fact, which makes the movie all the more dramatic. And the movie characters make some minor statements - based on fact - that would be lost on the audience without outside knowledge of those historical facts.Small case in point: The Eva Braun character is telling the Traudl Junge character that she ""so looked forward to coming to Berlin"" with the inference (to me) that she hadn't seen Hitler for awhile. Then I read elsewhere that she was in Obersaltzburg for 6 months away from Hitler prior to coming to Berlin. The director stated that he wanted this movie to be treated not only as a drama - but a documentary. He succeeded in both. I suppose this movie is controversial - a local reviewer said it tried to make Hitler sympathetic by giving him some human qualities but as someone else said this makes him all the more evil. It is these human qualities that make him a believable entity - kind to many individuals, indifferent and murderous to millions. And with the end he was indifferent to the fate of his own people, who were dying for him. Watching this movie made me think that the German people's initial support of Hitler followed a plot from Goethe - that a Mephistopheles - a demon in disguise - promises the recipient all that he wants in return for his soul. This of course is a theme that has subsequently replayed countlessly in western literature since Goethe's Faustus. This movie is based not only on Junge's book and Fest's book, but interviews with some of the survivors of the bunker.I would recommend not only the movie but then watch it with commentary from the director a second time. It is all the more haunting when you realize that virtually everything was based on fact during Berlin's last days.Bruno Ganz - as all the cast - turned in an excellent performance. Watching Ganz in this performance was watching Hitler. You will feel as if you too are a witness in the Bunker. The beginning and end statements by the real secretary Traudl Junge make the movie even more powerful. This movie was so moving for me that I have bought Traudl Junge's book, ""Until the Last Hour"". In the US on the DVD it is said it was nominated for ""best foreign picture"" - if it didn't win, it should have."
"The first 15 minutes made me doubt the qualities of this movie. The situations were a bit forced and the cuts were strange. But after the uncomfortable beginning the movie took momentum and kept it until the end.I think the choice of depicting Hitler as a human being with a dispassionate and modest direction was excellent. The film never tries to force viewers into an opinion. Everybody can form his own opinion. Too often the horrors of WWII led writers and directors to depict Nazis as monsters. Perfectly normal human beings can be cruel and merciless if they are blinded (by hate for example), which should never be forgotten.In a way, a human Hitler to me is more guilty than a raving monster. He had the choice and he chose to do wrong. He could choose life and he chose murder and destruction. A human being lost respect for the life of other human beings and led a country into genocide. Ultimately he loses respect for all life and starts sacrificing his own soldiers at random. This is what I value this film for, making the idea of a human Hitler tangible.It was very brave to make this film, given that controversy was almost certain to arise. One of the highlights of this year, to be sure."
"Having a huge interest in both World Wars and all that happened during the time period 1910-1950, I've seen a lot of movies and read even more books on the subject. Name me a more or less realistic war movie and I've probably seen it, so when ""Der Untergang"" was first released in Germany, I already knew I wanted to watch it as soon as it would be released over here. The commotion that it caused, the good critics that it got, all made me look forward to the day that I would see it, but really nothing could prepare me for what I saw... It was amazing, it was great, it was jaw-dropping...The main criticism that many people had on this movie was that Hitler and the other Nazi party members looked too human. I know, some people expect that the leaders of the Third Reich are only shown as real monsters, as people who didn't have any human feelings... But that's not the truth. The truth is that, no matter how horrible the things they did, they still were human and (most of the time) acted like normal human beings (for instance Hitler who really loved his German shepherd or who had one of Goebbels' children sitting on his lap while they were singing a song for him...). And let's be honest: do you think a leader who doesn't care for his people's destiny after the war, who doesn't want to see the truth that the war is lost, who knows all too well that he sends young children into battle (he even decorates them personally), but doesn't care, a man who can be so kind and sweet one moment and than be furious and outraged the other moment, really looks like a kind, sweet grandfather??? I don't think so. The makers of this movie never intended to make him look like a nice or a bad man, they intended to show him the way he really was and they did an amazing job.I've seen many documentaries about Hitler and read a lot of books about the man, so I think I can say I know quite well how he acted and reacted. Seeing Bruno Ganz as Hitler was a shock. He doesn't just look like Hitler, he IS Hitler in this movie!!! His performance was absolutely amazing and seeing him in this film really made shivers going down my spine. Hitler seemed to be alive again! If you've read so many books about the man as I did, you can only conclude that the resemblance is more than just remarkable, it is perfect.But of course there were more actors in the movie than Bruno Ganz (an actor who I admire since I saw ""Pane e Tulipani"" or ""Bread and Tulips"" for the first time). Even though I have to admit that I don't really know any of them, I must say that they all did an excellent job. Juliane Köhler as Eva Brown, Corinna Harfouch as Magda Goebbels, Alexandra Maria Lara as Traudl Junge, Ulrich Matthes as Joseph Goebbels,... They all must have studied there characters for many hours, because they were all excellent.As the horror and reality of the movie have only just ended and burned themselves on your retina for the rest of your life (By the end of the movie, you'll have seen many officers commit suicide, Hitler and Eva Brown being burned behind the bunker, the Goebbels murdering their children, people being hanged on a lantern for stupid reasons, young children dying as they try to defend Berlin...), you think you've had it all, but than the real Traudl Junge gives away a last testimony, looking back on her life with Hitler ... blowing you away even more. I can't remember that I've ever been so quiet after seeing a movie and apparently I wasn't the only one. Really no-one spoke a word during the first minutes after the lights went on again. I don't think many movies have ever touched the audience in such a deep way as this one did.Because of its historical value and realism, this movie should be seen by everybody and especially by young people at school. Forget those history books for once, this will get through to them at least ten times better. I'm sure that everybody will admit that this movie is a true masterpiece. People who don't know anything about the subject will be able to learn a lot about it and people who already thought they knew it all will still find some new things and will admit that this is exactly the way it must have been 60 years ago. I think there can be only one appropriate score for this movie and that is a full 10/10. Go see it people, NOW!!!"
"I had the DVD of this film for my birthday, and quite by chance also bought The Name Of The Rose (also produced by Bernd Eichinger) so I had the experience of watching two movies by this superb producer in two days, filmed 20 years apart.To save anyone who doesn't want to read further: I have over 200 DVDs in my collection and have no hesitation in placing this as #1.Now for the review: I'm not sure it is possible to write a 'spoiler' for historic events (not counting the people who came out of Titanic crying because 'the ship sank'<??>). We know Hitler died, we know the Allies won WWII.I came to this movie having read the book ""The Last Days Of Hitler"" by Hugh Trevor-Roper, who was the officer British Intelligence charged with finding out the truth, in September 1945. Obviously I was curious to see how Downfall compared.The main difference is in focus. While the book looks from the top (leadership) down, the film looks from the bottom (Traudl Junge - a secretary) up. The difference in perception is fascinating.Hitler: Our first view of him is somehow of a kindly man who stops dictating, looks at Traudl and says ""Let's try again"" when she fails to keep up with him. The duality of this, his private character is incredible and makes one think bipolar or schizophrenia as it seems impossible to believe that the raging monster who says that the German people do not deserve to survive is the same one who orders Junge and Christian to leave the bunker. If in his eyes the German people do not deserve life, why does he show concern for them? Is it because among his inner circle they are one of the vanishing number who have never betrayed him?Eva Braun: Blind loyalty is the only description I can find for her. Her devotion to Hitler is total, even when pleading for the life of Fegelein she bows unquestioningly to his decision.Traudl Junge: I can't say more than the lady herself, who in the DVD starts and ends the film with her judgment on herself. Her very simple stance (paraphrased) was ""Ignorance is no excuse. Youth is no excuse. I could have asked. I didn't want to know.""Josef Goebbels: Frightening. A true sociopath in every sense of the word. Hitler may have had the 'excuse' of mental illness towards the end, but Goebbels' actions were those of a rational thinking man who just did not see anything wrong in his actions. The ranting of a clearly unhinged mind is one thing, but save us all from the man who calmly considers his actions and rationalises such atrocities as those explained away by Goebbels.However, again like Hitler, his portrayal showed a stark duality to his character. One moment singing 'Happy Birthday' to Hitler with his children, with a warm smile and sparkling eyes; the next telling Traudl Junge very calmly that the German people quite rightly deserved the fate that was being visited on them.Magda Goebbels: As with other reviewers here, I found her almost the most chilling, second only to her husband. How any mother could deliberately and calmly bring about the deaths of her own children is something a rational mind cannot comprehend.Every single performance in the movie was captivating. I was glued to the screen from beginning to end. Bruno Ganz et al were perfect in their roles and brought every person back to life; as noted above sometimes to chilling effect. Talking to a friend on the phone about the film he thought I meant that the characters were stereotypical 'nasty Germans', but this is *not* the case.I've mentioned the duality of the main characters, but there were others, Prof. Dr. Ernst-Günter Schenck, Prof. Dr. Werner Haase, SS-Gruppenführer Hermann Fegelein to name but a few who showed that not all Germans were rabid Nazis, and that those who were, were very much in the minority. The Army in particular just wanted to get the war over with the minimum of casualties; a wish shared I think by every military commander throughout history.The look of the film was authentic and very atmospheric; whether in the cramped bunker (apparently built more as an authentic replica than a film-set) where the shots were mostly taken hand held as there was no space for a mounted camera; to the outdoor shots filmed in St Petersburg. It is rivaled in this respect only by Enemy At The Gates for capturing the full horror and idiocy of war.For true historians of the war - a must see.For all modern history students - a must see.For all who have never lived through war (I myself am 36 so I have not)Lest We Forget.A Must See."
"Seriously, I wasn't expecting much, but this was one of the best movies period. The actors and acting was terrific, the sets were incredible (St. Petersburg, Russia), the emotions... I felt like I was in Berlin during the last few days, I felt like I was in the bunker with Hitler. It is the most realistic depiction of the situation I had ever seen, and I almost felt a tear in my eye. And that is something, coming from a 40 year old Army veteran. The last 5 minutes, I was on the edge of my seat, when the Russians showed up. Anyway, this movie is totally recommended by me, but brush up on your Nazi history first, or you won't know who is who.I also liked it because it showed Hitler as a real human, and not the usual Anthony Hopkins/Alec Guiness ""nutbag"" Hitler, or the stereotypical ""demon"" Hitler. It showed him as he was, a broken down egomaniac. I will totally buy this movie and add it to my collection, which is rare for me to do these days."
"A lot of war movies have a sense of patriotism or commercialism, but Der Untergang feels like it is just giving you the cold hard facts of the last ten days of the Third Reich. I have to commend the filmmakers for not using black and white or filtering the color, like many other WW II movies today. It is becoming a cliché. The film is based on Traudl Junge's recollections of the last ten days she spent in Hitler's Bunker. It takes place entirely in the Bunker, which gives the film a very claustrophobic feel. As the outcome of the war becomes clearer, the Bunker becomes a cesspool of drunkenness, denial, and even death.Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge has a strange relationship with him. She stays with him out of sympathy and loyalty, but she is often horrified by his cruelty and inhumanity. This might be difficult to understand but I believe this makes the movie all the more realistic. She can recognize cruelty when she sees it but Hitler is the Fuhrer, a man who is practically worshiped. Hitler is shown to have elements of humanity. He despises smoking, loves his dog Blondi, and genuinely seems to care for his secretaries and Dr. Goebbel's children. We can feel his sorrow as the Russians advance toward Berlin. His dream of a German Empire had been lost and it breaks his soul. One of my favorite shots in the film is that of Hitler staring silently at a picture of Frederick the Great, seemingly thinking about his failures.This is not to say Der Untergang is pro Nazi. I believe that by portraying Hitler's humanity the film makes his crimes all the more terrible. If he was just a one dimensional monster that would be his excuse. The inhumanity of the Third Reich does emerge throughout the film. Hitler blames the German people for the defeat of the military, calling them cowards and saying they deserve their fate. Joseph Goebbels expresses similar sentiments. Magda Goebbels says she cannot live in a world without National Socialism, and poisons her children before committing suicide with her husband.The film perfectly captures an aura of hopelessness and denial. Eva Braun throws a party in the middle of the Russian bombing, trying to get her mind off Germany's impending defeat. She does anything and everything to keep her mind off the war. Hitler orders his Generals to move Tank divisions that do not exist or are too crippled to be of any use. He blames his Generals for Germany's defeat and not himself, which he usually did in real life. People around Hitler are aware that the situation is hopeless and betray him to save their own skin. In the midst of all the madness, some people have retained their sanity. Professor Schenck, a German Doctor, tries to help the wounded soldiers and civilians when his own government abandons them. Berlin is in ruins and people are left to fend for themselves. An old man tries to convince soldiers who are no more than thirteen that there is no point in fighting, but to no avail. Eva Braun's brother-in-law Fegelein tries to convince Braun to leave Berlin, but she cannot leave the Fuhrer. We sympathize with these people, and they only show how insane the Third Reich was. People commit suicide out of devotion to the Fuhrer. Corinna Harfouch plays a chilling Magda Goebbels; the scene where she pleads with Hitler not to kill himself was outstanding. The star of this movie though, is Bruno Ganz. His performance as Hitler feels so authentic it is frightening. If I ever had to recommend a movie just to see one performance, this would be one of them. Hitler has been played by great actors like Anthony Hopkins and Alec Guinness, but Ganz has received the most praise. I will seek out more of Ganz's movies based on this performance. At the end of the film, an excerpt from an interview with the real Traudl Junge is shown. She says that at the time of the Nuremberg trials she was shocked by what had happened in the Concentration Camps but did not consider herself responsible. Now she admits that she had no excuse. I would imagine this is how many Germans from her generation feel. I highly recommend Der Untergang to anyone who is interested in The Third Reich or anyone who appreciates good film making."
"This film is an absolutely stupendous achievement. Every aspect of this production is perfect. Brilliantly photographed, keenly written & directed, and filled with stellar performances led by Bruno Ganz, Der Untergang piqued my curiosity and made my skin crawl.I was aghast at the insanity and the horror that was the final days of the Third Reich. And leading the crazed was the Fuhrer himself, a miserable, twisted, twitching wretch of a man. Bruno Ganz is amazing as he lets us see all aspects of the man's personality, from kindly father to deranged psychopath. We see Hitler as a polite, well-mannered diner. We see Hitler as a screaming lunatic, ordering his generals to marshal forces which no longer exist. We see him as a devoted dog lover and vegetarian. We see him as a man who has no mercy for the brother of his longtime mistress (and soon-to-be wife). Mr. Ganz is worth 10 stars alone, even if you saw & heard nothing else in this film.I would be remiss were I not to also sing the praises of Alexandra Maria Lara, who portrays Traudl Junge, one of Hitler's secretaries. The film is told primarily from her point of view, and Ms. Lara's performance was compelling. I have no idea how you prepare for a role like this; portraying the hopelessness of being trapped with lunatics while bombs destroy everything except your locale cannot be easy, but Ms. Lara made me feel it every time she was on the screen. (It doesn't hurt that she is breathtakingly beautiful, either.)The script (by producer Bernd Eichinger) is excellent, covering a lot of ground succintly and elegantly. The direction is top-notch, providing us with the grit of real battles and the surreal atmosphere of Hitler's bunker. Locations, costumes, lighting, sets... every technical aspect of this film is perfect. It is as if they were able to somehow film the past.The horrors of Nazi Germany are well documented and publicized, as we strive to prevent that particular piece of history from repeating itself. Der Untergang's greatest achievement is that it is able to so perfectly place us in the middle of 10 of the worst days in the lives of some of the worst people ever to walk the planet. To see them as human beings, and not caricatures, is amazing. I tell you, I was unable to stop myself at times from simply muttering ""that's crazy! Madness!"" How can human's become so twisted, so deranged?Film is an inherently powerful medium, bombarding our senses like no other form of entertainment. As such, viewing this film in the larger context of the desirability of promulgating and maintaining a warlike culture may have a lasting impact on the viewer.A masterful achievement. All involved should be proud."
"This is an important film and absolutely a must for anyone who has ever pondered how WWII, the Holocaust and all that was at all possible.Der Untergang has sometimes been criticized for making Hitler and the Nazis look sympathetic and human. I saw it like this: the most horrifying thing about Hitler and Nazis is that they WERE humans, not some caricature monsters of hell. The movie displays this very well, without sympathizing or underlining the evil of these human beings.If you're a human being equipped with normal feelings, you ARE right in feeling slightly compassionate towards a crying Hitler. But at the same time, if you're a normal person, your compassion vanishes when you remember why he's crying. He's not regretting his inhuman deeds. He's not feeling remorse for the suffering of other people. He's crying because his horrible plans have failed, because he thinks the German people have failed him.I also think Der Untergang points out an important thing about the Nazi ideology. It was and is evil because it is based on intense hate and the conscious rejection of compassion. People blinded by this kind of ideology are also blinded by hatred, and as we know this phenomenon is unfortunately alive and well in today's world, in the East and the West as well. Movies like Der Untergang give us an important lesson in understanding this dangerous way of thought and the utter madness and vanity of war. Go see this if you can."
"In 1945 the second world war is coming to an end The German armies that once spread out all over Europe have been decimated and pushed back to the very heart of the German command in Berlin. Deep in his bunker, Hitler continues to rule with his group of generals, families and Traudl, his secretary. Awaiting armies that no longer exist and making plans that his generals are too scared to tell him are impossible, Hitler refuses to surrender as the streets and citizens of Berlin suffer between the remaining defending forces and the advancing Russian army. Gradually, as it becomes obvious that all is lost, the dream collapses and all that is left is death.A few months ago, a fellow user on this site asked me if I thought if Der Untergang was going to get nominated for an Oscar or not; I must admit that at the time I had not heard of it, but decided to see it if I got the chance. Of course it took me a few weeks to be in the mood for a long war movie that I knew was not going to have a good ending for anyone. When I went to see this film, the woman selling me my tickets asked if I knew it was a German film, I asked why it mattered and she said that they had had quite a few people leave the screening complaining about the fact it wasn't in English; doubtless these people then went into the next available screening of Be Cool (or whatever) and turned off their hearts and minds and just talked their way through the movie. Anyway, enough of my multiplex complaining, in fairness I did join a surprisingly full screening of this film and immediately got into it. The focus of the story was the bunker and it is compelling in its portrayal, with the cold emotion, the cruel sentiments and the utter pointlessness of the whole thing.The characters are not that well developed; they were never really people to me but they did enough to fit their roles within this story. That said, the whole story is compelling and it didn't matter that I didn't care for the characters as people because they were gripping to watch nonetheless. The film works well to paint the inanity of the whole thing but also cut in moments that are so cold that they almost made me shiver  for example, when Hitler is told of the loss of all the young officers, he simply replies ""that is what the young are for"". The film does not forget the people above ground and the scenes of destruction of Berlin are impacting  those who say that the civilians deserved it should see this and try to understand what they would have done in the situation; I am part of a country that went to war with Iraq, by that logic I deserve to have that country retaliate against me, even though I opposed the manner in which we did it.The acting is classy even though the characters are quite thin at times. Ganz is a great Hitler and gets it spot on throughout the film; however he does well not to dominate the film  his death (no spoiler there) doesn't stop the film because he was not what the film was all about. Lara is good although a bit too wide-eyed to convince; her real confessions at the end of the film are a bit too forgiving of her as a person but it does serve as a fair ending to the film. Harfouch and Matthes are cold and effective as the Goebbels' while the rest of the support cast all fit their roles well, with a good mix of opinions and approaches across the generals facing Hitler.Overall this is a good film although it is not an easy one to watch. The bunker scenes are cold and compelling even if the characters are broad historical reference points rather than people, meanwhile the attacks on Berlin are brutal and difficult to just watch without being moved. The manner in which the film ends is just as you'd expect, with nothing achieved but destruction by all of German's years before and during the war. The end credits remind us that 50 million people died during the war, including 6 million Jews and ethnic minorities systematically murdered  having seen the men who organised all this taking their own lives the main thing I felt was just how pointless and wasteful the whole thing had been and I left the film having ""enjoyed"" the quality film but being utterly depressed by the world in which we live."
"You couldn't really expect to make a 'typical' movie out of the story of last days of the archetypal fascist dictator. 'Untergang' seeks to illustrate the situation of 'sane' people under the control of a madman; that and the impending arrival of the Red Army is the only dramatic jeopardy available - no romantic interlude, nothing to achieve, no sentimental buddy rescue shtick. We witness the reactions of people like you and me (and don't be silly enough to imagine I include Goebbels, etc. - I mean people doing their jobs under impending calamity) who happened to be in the wrongest place at the wrongest time. If this dilemma doesn't absorb you, it's a fault of your imagination, not of the utterly brilliant recreation of something very few people survived to bear witness to. 'Untergang' doesn't seek to make a judgment of Hitler because it doesn't need to: all you need to appreciate is his increasing detachment from reality and the way that this divides the people stuck with him. If there's any sort of judgment, it's of the herd mentality of people as a whole. The film becomes a series of stunning docu-vignettes of the various levels of humanity involved, each one posing the question 'What would YOU have done?'. This film is thought-provoking, and that naturally makes many denizens of the internet uncomfortable."
"Now here is a novel idea, making a movie from the ""enemy's"" point of view, attaching a human face to probably the most notorious institute of evil in human history. Before watching this film, I had reservations over how much I would enjoy it and what I might gain from it. I was concerned that the film may be an attempt to show the human side of the Nazi party, to make us sympathetic not to their cause, but to their human nature. I had to think to myself, do I really want to attach a human element to people who history has painted as monsters? The film begins with Hitler recruiting Traudl Junge as a new secretary in 1942, from this point onwards the film is predominantly (but not entirely) seen through her eyes. This key scene at the beginning of the film shows how people reacted to their leader with fanatical loyalty, holding him high in reverence. This gives us a brief insight into the belief of his followers that what they were doing would lead them to a golden utopia, a better world. All to often in films concerning Nazi's, they are portrayed as evil personified, killing for killing's sake, being evil for the sake of being evil. What we get throughout this film is a more realistic viewpoint of people's attitudes. The people who followed Hitler may have no entirely agreed with everything he said, may have not hung on his every word, but believed that he would lead them to a greater future, as such they followed.Bruno Ganz, does a magnificent job of playing one of history's most notorious and documented individuals. He plays the role as, what I feel, accurately and realistically as possible. He resists the temptation to play Hitler as an uber-evil super-villain, disregarding all life who opposes him and wiping out humans at a whim. He plays the roles as an ageing leader, loosing grip on his health, his sanity and his conquest. A man who was kind, considerate and caring to children, his dog and his civilian staff, but who also attempted to wipe out an entire race of people and was proud of himself for doing it. It shows a man willing to send young children into the street to resist enemy advancement, it shows a man who believes that the civilian population would not be evacuated, as it was their chance to rise up (women and children, the old and sick, un armed) and prove they deserved victory. This film raises the question, was Hitler an evil man who practised evil deeds through his beliefs? or were his evil deeds a result of his absolute pursuit of his beliefs? Watching Ganz's performance, you get the feeling all Hitler had left before he took his life, was his ideals (not that this is anything to be proud of). He had lost the war, he had lost the respect of several of his commanding officers and he had lost his grip on reality.The film also shows Hitler's closest officers and staff, it shows how they react to the downfall. Some have blind and fanatical faith that Hitler will act as their saviour and devise a scheme to turn the battle around. Some accept that their leader has lost his grip, but follow with blind devotion anyway. Some are not so sure and see the cracks in the beliefs they were fighting for. The film shows these often horrifying moments and realisations in all to realistic detail.Ultimately, Downfall shows the human and personal element of the end of the war for Hitler and the Nazis. It shows how real people, people who tell jokes, drink, socialise, listen to songs and dance, also followed national socialism with a devotion that drove them to do the terrible things they did. It shows how they did not believe what they were doing was wrong, in their minds they were paving the way for their glorious future. It also shows their fanatical devotion and blind faith in their goal, led to their downfall, both as a movement and as human beings.Downfall is an amazing and powerful film, documenting an unseen side of a major historical event. The film ends with video footage of the real Traudl Junge talking about her feelings towards the war and he involvement with the Nazis. She says that when she first became involved with the Nazis, she was in awe of their power and beliefs, she may have not agreed with everything they did, but what difference would her being involved or not make? She was ignorant to their deeds and as such held a clean conscience. Then she says has realised over time she had the power not to be ignorant to their deeds, that she should have stayed away from them, realising them for the evil that they were. I felt she was warning what ignorance can lead to, that no matter how tiny one person is in the scheme of things, it is no excuse to contribute towards the wrong cause.Excellent historical film, highly recommended."
"I tuned in late to this film, not expected very much, because we have all I suppose seen so many documentaries of Hitler's last days in the bunker, and a reconstruction with Alec Guiness thrown in for good measure. Many of these presentations depend on interviews with Trudl Junge, Hitler's secretary at the time. Her descriptions of the goings on during the final days are cool, precise, and dispassionate. First Hitler said this, then Eva Braun said that, and then they went up into the garden. A human surveillance camera who seems to have no personal mechanism for judgments.She was, however, quite human after all. The last shot of the film is from an interview with her before her death in 2002. She explains to us that, young as she was, she had always put aside any feeling of guilt for her involvement in the Third Reich, negligible as it was. But then, one day, she passed a monument to Sophie Scholl who sacrificed herself in the course of resisting Naziism, and Frau Junge tells the camera -- and the rest of the world -- that she realized at that moment that youth and naiveté could no longer serve as her excuse.I missed the first half hour or so, but I stayed for the rest. This is an extremely powerful movie. The events in the bunker are keenly observed. There is virtually nothing in the way of sentiment or dramatic displays. If the director, Hirschbiegel, wants two officers to commit suicide he may have them walk into a room and close the door behind them, then allow us to hear two shots a bit later.No one talks about despair. Instead, the officers and some of the ladies sit around a table in one of the bunker's rooms and get drunk as skunks.This is a tragic ending to an insane war, and it is all enacted by human beings, not demons. Goebbels and his wife have 5 beautiful young children, a boy and four girls. They deliberately give them knockout drops, then Frau Goebbels puts a capsule of fast-acting poison in each of their mouths, one after another, and crunches the capsule by pressing each child's teeth together. Then, wordlessly, Goebbels and his wife walk up into the open where, still wordlessly, he shoots her and then himself -- off camera. The soldiers who have been waiting impatiently for this ritual to end, then scurry forward with cans of gasoline to dispose of the bodies.The episode is impossible to watch without being moved. What have Goebbels and his wife died for? What did their children, who knew nothing of war or racism, die for? And, implicitly, the film asks, what did some 50 million people die for between 1939 and 1945? I am grateful to the director and the actors for keeping things so matter of fact. Preparations for a predictable death are pretty gruesome even with the most tasteful intentions, and too often executions and suicides seem to have the filmmakers' attention lavished on them for not much reason other than to pander to a morbid interest in watching someone else die, a kind of arousal jag.How easy it would have been for a trashy sensibility to give us the death of Hitler's German shepherd, Blondi, in all its horror. A DOG yet! Those of us who might have cheered at Hitler's death would now have a chance to weep over Blondi's. Instead, except for a few instructive inserts, Blondi's poisoning is only glimpsed in a clumsy shot through an open doorway.Congratulations to everyone involved in this production. They've given us a well-executed film, made for adults. They come along so rarely."
"The film deals with the history of Hitler's last days in underground bunker , it's the true story of the historic downfall and death (at age 55 in 1945) of the infamous Nazi dictator's culprit of death of 50 million people during second war world and killing of 6 million Jewish in concentration camps . The Fuhrer's last few tortured days in his underground bunker against a Berlin background . Hitler had height five feet , seven inches , eyes black , hair black , shaggy locks hung over forehead , complexion sallow , wide mustache , various hairs on each side ; besides he had marked devotion to brown shirts and old trench-coat and always surrounded by armed thugs and expert gunmen . He had demented gaze with tendency to become hysterical on slight provocation with delusions , particularly upon his place in history and his powers over vast numbers of people and addicted to public hysteria on race purity , and known to throw himself on the floor and gnaw rugs, guttural voice apt to rise to shrill tones when excited or thwarted . He was a congenital liar suffering from dreams of persecution . Almost all these physical descriptions and particulars of Hitler are perfectly incarnated by Bruno Ganz who even studied Parkinson's disease patients in a Swiss hospital to prepare for his role . Thus , he magnificently plays him as a sadistic , malicious , dangerous , vengeful, mystical and maniacal man .Bruno Ganz's portrayal is the perfection in the Hitler role one would expect at least on the surface , he gives insight to his madness and with persuasive qualities of his interpretation . A flawless casting with excellent German actors such as Alexandra Maria Lara (personal secretary Traudl Junge and the picture is based on his book) as co-protagonist , Juliane Kohler (Eva Braun) and distinguished players as Ulrich Matthes (Joseph Goebbles) , Corinna Harfouch (Magda Goebbles) and Thomas Kretschman . Besides , a nice support cast who play to famous characters as Martin Borman , Alber Speer , General Keitel , General Jodl and Hermann Goering and specially Heimrich Himmler who will betray to Hitler deciding along with the count Bernardotte to agree peace with the Allies , originating his hysteria splendidly reflected in the movie . In spite of Berlin is surrounded and meanwhile the bloody war with enormous bombing fall about the survivors and last defending , Hitler prepares the sad farewell very well narrated by the director Oliver Hirschbiegel and superbly captured the atmosphere by the cameras . The motion picture is one of the best war movies ever made , on pair with ¨Das Boot (also German movie and directed by Wolfgang Petersen) and ¨Saving private Ryan¨ (Steven Spielberg) . The flick will appeal to historical cinema enthusiasts and warlike genre fans. Rating : Above average and astounding , being interesting and thoughtful ."
"I feel the praise of this movie has been sung many times already on this site, so I will not go into all that it does right. However, after reading some of the reviews that are rightfully in the back pages here, I do think there is an issue that needs to be addressed here.Apparently some people think we are all ignorant children, who need to be spoon-fed a message about how ""inhuman"" the Nazis were. I have even seen reviews that called this movie dangerous, because it sympathized with Hitler.If you haven't seen this film yet, don't get fooled by these misguided comments. If this movie is dangerous, it is dangerous to people who wish to believe that Adolf Hitler was Satan incarnate, and that all who followed him were bloodthirsty demons who fed on baby corpses. I can hardly believe this fact offends people but: he wasn't, and they weren't. Both Hitler and his followers were human beings, who did things human beings do. They were friendly to each other, they cared for the people close to them, while at the same time plotting to kill millions of innocent people. They enjoyed cake and embraced their lovers, and then decided to send twelve year old boys to sacrifice their lives to keep off the Russian army for a couple of hours more.This is what Der Untergang shows, and why it was hailed with so much praise. It actually moved beyond the cardboard cut-out cliché of movie Nazis. Just show a man utterly devoid of any humanity, a death machine, and stick him in a nazi uniform, and hey presto, an accurate depiction of a nazi. That has all been done thousands of times, and it makes us feel safe, because we can identify them as bad guys from a mile away, and we can then morally judge the idiots that fell for the whole nazi movement. We would never fall for anyone that evil. This movie chooses selfconsciously not to go for that approach, but instead show us the true insanity of the nazi-regime. That they actually believed that what they were doing was for the good of the German people.If people see Der Untergang as a campaign to show the Nazis as the good guys, let them explain the scene in which Frau Goebbels killed her own children, the scene in which Hitler condemns the German people for being weaklings who deserve death, or the scene where Joseph Goebbels tells an army officer that the German people brought their destruction on themselves, with a smirk on his face, showing he enjoys this consequence of his decision (or, for that matter, one of the many other scenes which show the cruelty of the Nazis). Do you really believe this movie will make anyone believe the Nazis were just idealistic dreamers who should be sympathized with for not achieving their goals?"
"I would give this an 7.5 or 8, if it were not for Bruno Ganz. In fact, I will dare say that the biggest crime surrounding this film is that Ganz was not lauded with every single acting award available. Never before has such dimensionality and care been applied to a performance of, quite possibly, the most vile human who ever lived (with the exception, perhaps, of his cohort Himmler). It's a confusing, sharp yet tender mix of sorrow, pity, anger, and ultimately, frustration. Initially, I figured this would be a very low budget chamber piece. But it is as epic in scope as a Spielberg war film, with effects to match. A real surprise. But don't be fooled by eye candy. Der Untergang is a human story. It is an amazing built film. And it is unreal. A must-see."
"I am not very much into history events, so cant be sure about any historical goof in the movie but I have to admit that I have never seen such a FLAWLESS movie before. screenplay and direction is simply awesome, and what makes the movie a 'classic' is the acting. Bruno Ganz, Alexandra Maria Lara and Juliane Köhler have given one of the best performances ever. They have lived through the characters, simply irresistible. This movie has actuated me to explore more movies from the director and the actors. I would have enjoyed movie more if I knew German as I had to ping pong between subtitles and the movie. Personally, I would rate this movie higher than Godfather or any other movie."
"The outstanding qualities of this film have already been discussed at length, I want to address some of the criticisms levelled against this film by 'the experts' (critics and historians).Why are they so outraged by a film that portrays the nazi leadership as human beings? The actions and mannerisms shown in this film are entirely consistent with how those people acted in real life. Yes, Hitler was a genocidal leader, but he was just a man, not a demon. He was capable of great cruelty but was it is often remarked that he was capable of decent conversation with people and was generally amiable but patronising in his dealings with subordinates. These attributes, I feel, were accurately portrayed in the film.What about the film portraying war criminals (eg, keitel, jodl, speer) in a positive light, as brave and honourable men? This film made it clear that it was a representation of the final days and hours of the nazi regime. the death camps have been liberated by the advancing allies, the victories of 1939-41 a distant memory. Yes, these people were guilty of war crimes but that doesn't mean they would act like in a cowardly or dishonourable way when their homeland was under siege.Take a look at any good film, book or just at humanity in general, you will see that ALL people are capable of cruelty but also of honour, bravery and loyalty.Why is it controversial to portray the nazi leadership in such a way? I think the film displays well the internal tug-of-war - loyalty to their leader against reality and self-preservation - taking place in each persons head while they deal with the inevitable capitulation.Finally, where are these critics when Hollywood produces some awful pap that portrays historical events emerges? Whether they re-write history (eg. braveheart or mel gibsons patriot) or try and play 13th century characters with 21st century liberal emotions (eg. kingdom of heaven) these films escape the large scale criticisms levelled at der untergang.Why does Hollywood produce this nonsense? Is the true story of what happened (the American revolution, the crusades, ww2) not interesting enough for cinema viewing? I think it is and the accurate, human portrayal of Hitler and the German people in der untergang proves this."
"The first internationally released German production to feature Hitler as a central figure, ""Downfall"" (2004) takes place in the dismal gloomy Berlin during April - May 1945 in anticipation of the inevitable German defeat. The film shows the last days of Hitler and those close to him through the eyes of his young secretary, Traudl Junge.Oliver Hirschbiegel's film has been criticized by some circles as presenting a ""too sympathetic"" portrait of the Fuhrer. I don't believe anything in the film suggests that its creators sympathize with the Nazi regime and those who had orchestrated it.Showing Hitler as a human being (amazing performance by Bruno Ganz), a man who loved his dog, was a vegetarian and could display some moments of tenderness did not undermine the overall image of a lonely, domineering, conscienceless, and hateful man who believed that his people, his compatriots, women and children deserve to die because they are no longer deserve to live and because ""in a war as such there are no civilians"".Did those who think that that the film ""humanized"" Hitler forget the most chilling scene in the movie, the one that shows Frau Goebbels crush the ampoules with cyanide between her children's teeth, after they had been dosed with a sleeping draught? She did it not because she was scared of what would happen to them after the war, no, her reason was, ""The country without National Socialism and its party is not worth living in"". How dangerous Hitler was if he could induce such a blind devotion that could convince a mother of six to murder her children in cold blood.Bernd Eichinger, the producer and scriptwriter of ""Downfall"" emphasized, the greatest danger he saw in making a film about Hitler was the temptation to show him as a psychopath or madman: ""Hitler possessed an enormous criminal and destructive energy, and he was a barbarian in the most fundamental sense of the term... But I am convinced that he was totally of sound mind until the very end, which is why leadership never slipped from his hands."" The film's director Oliver Hirschbiege says that, in the same way it was evil of Hitler to see Jews as less than human beings - i.e. as ""insects"" - it would be equally wrong to portray Hitler as a madman, because that would excuse him of culpability: ""I think the biggest mistake is to have an image of Hitler as insane - that he was not a human being but a monster. The most important point to realize is that Hitler was not a madman, not a psychopath or someone on drugs, which implies that he wasn't responsible for what he was doing. Of course he was responsible! ""For me, (this film is) paying homage to and truly honoring the victims, because we fall short if we explain the Holocaust by stating that they were all out of their minds. They knew what they were doing!"" I believe that the result of their work, the film I saw last night is absolutely unforgettable - honest, powerful and devastating. It is a masterwork of film-making and a very important in its objectivity historical document.9.5/10"
"World War 2 is to a large extent a myth. It is a video game. It is the never ending virtual battle of Normandy. It is a teenager called ""killer-x"" online fragging n00bs. World War 2 is when the glorious, noble west defeated the Great Satan. World War 2 lasted six years and yet it never ended. We in the west keep finding new Hitlers to kill, new evils to fight. Yet, the World War II is filled with uncomfortable facts. I should know. For my country was allied with the Nazi Germany fighting Soviet Union. And It was the cold Russian winters that broke the Nazi war machine.That's why I don't watch WW2 movies. Only Das Boot has managed to capture the madness and the futility of war properly. It is only when you have lost everything, that you are forced to come to terms with what you have done.Der Untergang is the finest war movie I have ever seen in my entire life.Bruno Ganz is simply mesmerizing as Adolf Hitler. Hitler is the Roman Emperor watching his once mighty Empire come to a bitter end, refusing to accept it. Sanity has been abandoned long time a go. Hitler is moving imaginary armies on a map. Coming up with plans to outflank the Soviet beast that is fast approaching the new Rome, Berlin. Sometimes the devil is overcome with fartherly love towards his flawed little children, who can't perform even the simplest of tasks in his powerful presence. He understands their shortcomings and shows patience. He charms the people and minutes later curses his Generals for betraying him. ""The best Germans died long a go! I am surrounded with weaklings!"" He yells. Eva Brauns refusal to come to terms with what is happening (The Empire is ending), is a true testament to human madness. Bombs go off just meters away but she'll be damned before that stops her from dancing and throwing a party. ""Why are people so depressing? Let's have some fun!"" For a few minutes we see the young ladies go outside the bunker to have a cigarette. We learn that life actually does go on. Bombs go off again and we descend back into the madhouse. Back into the bunker. Mass suicides, decadence of the human soul continue inside Hitlers house of insanity. At least Eva has the love of her life beside her now. Now at the end Hitler is hers. The reasons why the Nazi regime fought till the bitter end, was because of the allied policy of Unconditional surrender, Morgenthau Plan and World War 1. Not because of some insane loyalty towards a brutal dictator. People rarely like dictators. Der Untergang shows no love towards the dictator either, but for the first time the Dictator is human. And that is the big lesson. The Great Devils are in fact human. They represent the ultimate failure of the human spirit."
"While I didn't see Downfall in theaters, I had heard the great word of mouth that it had received and quickly picked it up on DVD. The movie totally took me by surprise and not only amazed, but also shocked and, in an unanticipated turn of events, saddened me. It is something that I did not expect from a picture about the death of Adolf Hitler. Downfall tells the tragic tale of a madman, a person who, while still very human, is the ultimate victim of the sins that man, in his very nature, embodies.The film is based on the memoirs of Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara), who was Hitler's appointed secretary. The plot also uses Inside Hitler's Bunker by Joachim Fest in order to keep the plot as historically accurate as possible. Hitler (player to a T by the remarkable Bruno Ganz) is always the main focus of the movie, and even when he is not on camera his shadow on the events that happen on screen is always felt. Minor grave endeavors are shown throughout the movie and director Oliver Hirschbiegel does a good job of connecting them to the main problem  the Nazi Party. These happenings range from instances of violence on the streets, to a shocking scene in which a mother poisons her own children as instructed by the Fuhrer himself.The most intriguing part of the film is not the realistic reproduction of a bombed city, or the amazing acting by all involved, although these things are startling and deserve awards. No, the best part is definitely the way Hitler is illustrated. During his last ten days, he didn't have control over anything, not the country, not the army, and not even the Nazi party itself. While the movie depicts those things really well, it goes even deeper and acknowledges that the Fuhrer couldn't even control himself. It was something not even he realized until those final moments in that dark bunker, where he shot himself.The movie looks great thanks to the cinematography of Rainer Klausmann, with battle scenes and aftermaths colored in strikingly cheerless tones. Credit also has to go to director Hirschbiegel for the choices he made as far as what to film and where in the movie to put it. It is also to his credit, the way he directs the actors. Bruno Ganz practically embodies Hitler, portraying both his flaws, and few positive traits. All the actors around him, while turning in great performances are simply sidekicks, remarkably mirroring the roles their characters played in Hitler's real life.So in this film you get not only an enormously accurate picture of World War II itself, but also an accurate portrait of the life of the most important and flawed man in arguably all of human history. Downfall is an endlessly rewarding motion picture and one of the best of the year. So if you don't mind the German language and having to read subtitles, you will be able to acknowledge the importance of Oliver Hirschbiegel's Downfall, and its way of delving deep beneath the skin of its main character."
"First of all, because I think it matters, I am from Germany.Almost everyday in our lives, we young German people are still confronted with what happened 60 years ago. Sometimes, we still have to be careful what we say about strangers, about people of foreign countries, about people of a different religion. 60 years after our grandparents made a few terrible mistakes. So far, so good. My generation has no idea, what it has meant to live in the 3rd Reich, how people could follow a sick man like Hitler, follow his pervert ideas, obey anything this mentally insane man. But still we have to carry our heritage, every day we have to remember what happened 60 years ago. We have to. And films like Downfall, Schindlers List or The Pianist let us not forget, let us learn and remember. And that's why movies like Downfall are necessary, are important. Especially, if they of such great quality as this one. Only in one point this film is dangerous: It creates a picture of Hitler as a man, not as a monster. A sick man, a man with pervert ideas attitudes, okay, but a man who can also be polite and regarding. A human being. It is no question, that this is an almost perfect personification of Hitler, Bruno Ganz is amazing and the scriptwriters were brilliantly informed about the Fuehrer as a person. But as I said, some people who still have these radical ideas and see Hitler as a God-like figure (and they exist, not only in Germany!) might misunderstand this personification. ""Der Untergang""is a masterpiece of German cinema, but it is nothing for a narrow-minded audience...."
"This ultimate meme generator is one great, seriously made movie. Its authenticity is its best asset, as it shows the last days of the fallen German regime as it was. The downfall is of interest to anyone wanting to learn about history, and history is the best teacher of life. The most famous son of Austria is not portrayed entirely as a monster, which is a plus given the authenticity is the goal. But it is the crumbling empire and the atmosphere of utter despair, as the Ruskies come to deliver some well deserved come uponce and tough justice to the country that get a bit over themselves one time too many. NATo and Americans, take note. This is where arrogance and criminality on world stage has ended in history and not once, but EVERY time. Take a good, fresh look what happened to Germany, and then take a good fresh look in the mirror, and perhaps ponder a bit about fate, before making next mindless meme out of some of the many rants of the favorite son of the German nation of the times. Perspective can change, it might take a few well placed bombs from the ever unforgiving Russians, but you can get there eventually."
"I admit that I only heard of this movie through watching Youtube spoofs of Hitler's tirade scene, but the film interested me so much that I had to see for myself. I only EVER give reviews to movies which I feel are either terrible or extraordinary. This movie was the latter. It is by far one of the best WWII films ever made, and the best made in the 21st century.I was blown away when I finished the film, stunned by its visual effect quality, precise acting, and near perfect play-out of the plot. The film shows the tumultuous and rocky end of the Reich's last 12 days, as you witness the end of Hitler's empire in his very bunker. The screenplay gives marvelous insight into the inner conflict that the Fuhrer himself suffers as well as the conflict with his most loyal commanders and generals. Seeing the story from the eyes of Traudl Junge (played by the beautiful and talented Alexandra Maria Lara)is another special treat, as you see her own struggle between loyalty to the Reich and personal conscience.The film is by far superior to many of its ""end-of-the-Reich"" predecessors. For its brilliant screenplay, superb acting, and intense storytelling, it gets a 10 from me."
"""I was not an enthusiastic Nazi,"" a woman's voice-over tells us at the opening of ""Downfall,"" as if to underscore her lack of complicity in Germany's actions in the second World War, or perhaps to convince herself. It is 1943 when director Oliver Hirschbiegel's film about the last tormented days of Adolph Hitler begins, and that voice belongs to the real Traudl Junge (played here by Alexandra Maria Lara), one of several young women smuggled into the Führer's headquarters in East Prussia to interview for a position as his private secretary. When she messes up the first go-round at dictation, Traudl, whose curiosity about Hitler is the catalyst for her adventure, is moved by the dictator's gentleness and generosity. A moment later she is jumping for joy to land such a prestigious position.Two and a half years later, things are considerably different. The German military has suffered severe losses, Berlin is under artillery attack by the advancing Russians, the great experiment in National Socialism is crumbling like the city, and Hitler (Bruno Ganz) and his key commandants have retreated to the leader's private bunker. But the megalomaniacal Hitler, who irrationally still believes he can produce a Third Reich that is a German ""treasure house of art and culture"" comparable to that of the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations, not only refuses to give up, but also shouts at his minions that a new military strategy is in effect that will help them win the war. How delusional! Despite their resolute faith in the Führer, even some of the elite members of the SS have come to mistrust his judgment. Albert Speer (Heino Ferch), the famed architect of the Third Reich, looks askance at Hitler over a table top model of the cultural structures he planned to create for the master race. Field marshall Hermann Göring cannot (or will not) obey orders. Nazi doctors refuse to let civilians and young men die without some attempt at medical attention. When Hitler is told that ""fifteen to twenty thousand"" of those young men were lost in an effort to fight off the Russians, his heartlessly-spewed response is: ""that's what they're for."" But he will go out onto the street during a lull in the shelling to honor youngsters as heroes who ""history will take note of,"" and pinch the cheek of one particularly innocent- looking lad.The bipolarity of a man who himself has gone down in history as one of its greatest monsters is at the heart of ""Downfall,"" the screenplay (by Bernd Eichinger) for which is based on historian Joachim Fest's book (The Downfall: Inside Hitler's Bunker, The Last Days of the Third Reich) and on the memoir of the real Traudl Junge (Until the Final Hour: Hitler's Last Secretary). The film does not ask us to sympathize with this madman (given his actions, how could it?), but it does present a profile of a man who, despite his obvious dementia, still managed to hold sway over those who earlier pledged their loyalty to him and were determined to maintain it to the bitter end. And is it ever bitter.The claustrophobic confines of the elaborately designed bunker (by Production Designer Bernd Lepel) are reminiscent of the submarine in the German film ""Das Boot."" We can practically smell its fetid air and feel the walls closing in on us as the Russians close in on the city. Given these circumstances, we can understand how Eva Braun (""Nowhere in Africa's"" Juliane Köhler in another terrific performance) can say to Traudl, ""The shelling has stopped, let's go for a walk,"" even if the suggestion is as insane as staying with Hitler. But like the others who stick it out and who, in many instances, make inhuman, incomprehensible sacrifices to do so, both women descend yet again to that labyrinth of madness.Aside from the exploration of Hitler's increasingly fragile grip on reality, what is most fascinating about how he is depicted is his appeal, particularly to women. In addition to Traudl and Eva Braun, the short, mustachioed man with the thinning comb-over mesmerized such otherwise strong-willed women as pilot Hanna Reitsch (Anna Thalbach), and Magda Goebbels (Corinna Harfouch), wife of Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels (Ulrich Matthes). As such, ""Downfall's"" strength is greatest when it sticks to these human dynamics rather than when it sidetracks to subplots outside the bunker that have little or nothing to do with the story that unfolds in that enclosed world.War is the ugliest, or among the ugliest of human actions, and ""Downfall"" does not glamorize it. On the contrary, despite its technically superb cinematography (by Rainer Klausmann, who also shot ""Head On""), there are a number of graphic sequences that underscore the horrors of war, as if we needed reminding. Then again, perhaps we do. ""Downfall"" does not necessarily present new information on those last twelve days of Hitler's life, but it does present it in a worthwhile way. In a time of war, such as the one we are currently living in, it is important to remember that monsters are made, not born, and that they lurk beneath the surface of some otherwise very ordinary humans."
"What an amazing film. I'm at a loss for words.First of all, this project which took two years of director Oliver Hirschbiegel's life was an incredibly brave thing to tackle, seeing as there hasn't been a film chronicling Hitlers last days for 30+ years.The attention to detail is there to see as well and as far as I can tell, is factually as accurate as it possibly can be. There is debate as to some of the possible events such as how exactly Hitler's body was disposed but it also seems in order Chronologically. On top of that it also feels very frank and honest and without compromise. Bruno Ganz is simply awesome as Hitler. His detailed research and analysis of Hitler and his mannerisms pays off spectacularly. It really feels like it could be him, and to pull that off in a much copied and more importantly, parodied figure is truly genius. Some of the scenes such as his various rants at his officers and generals, where Speer tells him of his betrayals had me in awe of this mans performance.There were some incredibly shocking scenes also like where the German officer kills his family for not being able to leave Berlin.Akin to 'The Pianist' this is simple, but honest film-making at it's best, which demands the utmost from cast and crew in order to succeed, typified by the final scene with the Goebbels children and the Goebbels themselves. I must say, I thought the casting for Goebbels was tremendous.Put simply, this is a film that, like 'All quiet on the Western Front', will be remembered in 100 years time"
"I am just laughing to the comment I've just read: ""terribly boring, full of clichés"". I can't believe that Kill Bill and similar movies entered top 250. Who the hell voted for Kill Bill?! I guess movies with Will Smith and Meg Ryan take big money because people like this. This movie has great aspect of view on WWII. Every time I watch good movie about WWII I change my mood in depressive or something like that. After watching it I spent few hours thinking about that maybe most important period in history. But this is the best movie on that topic. Definitely better than Saving Private Ryan, that is, I would say a bit pro American ( I mean, American were not the only victims of WWII), though I never watched Cross of Iron."
"I'm not normally one to go for historic movies but, being of German origin and born 10 years after the end of the 2nd World War, I thought I'd have a look at it. And boy, did it knock my socks off! Having always been a dedicated anti-fascist with a left-wing past, I never imagined that I could be moved by the events and problems within the factions of Hitler's cronies, military personnel or ministers. But moved I was and I found it almost impossible to watch the last scene with Goebbels' children... The performance by Bruno Ganz as Hitler is awesome and would've deserved an Oscar in my opinion and the atmosphere created in the movie is haunting. No other movie has made such an impression on me in the last couple of decades. Highly recommended."
"You may have reservations about seeing this movie.Maybe, as some critics have implied, the movie ""humanizes"" Hitler and Nazis.Maybe it would be creepy to watch a movie where most of the action takes place in an underground bunker.Maybe you just don't want to go to a foreign language film.Forget your reservations. You need to see this movie, on a big screen, with an audience. It is a masterpiece. I'd rank it with ""Gone with the Wind,"" ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" and ""Saving Private Ryan."" ""Downfall"" depicts events of world historical importance through the eyes of complex characters and it does so masterfully. ""Downfall"" raises important questions, and it also presents the viewer with a compelling visual epic.Performances are first-rate. Costume design, the recreation of bombed-out Berlin, of air raids, are so realistic that you feel plunged into another world.From the first scene, I was completely immersed in the world of ""Downfall."" I was moved; at times I cried. On screen characters make unintentionally funny comments, for example, about how they will negotiate with the Americans after the war. More than once, everyone in the theater where I saw the movie laughed out loud.And, I raged.I don't know when I've reacted so strongly to a movie. I'm sure you've seen the press conference where American military show film footage of the newly captured Saddam Hussein to Iraqi journalists. The Iraqis in the audience, seeing the film footage of Hussein, began to curse and shout and shake their fists at the screen. That's how I wanted to react to this movie.Like most people interested in history, I've seen archival film footage of Hitler's speeches, and productions like ""Triumph of the Will."" That film footage did not prepare me for ""Downfall""'s painstaking recreation of Nazism. There they are: Himmler, Goering, Goebbels, Speer, and Hitler himself, chatting, eating, planning, going about their day-to-day activities.Their painfully realistic images on screen filled me with rage.Another reviewer here commented on her strong reaction to watching Magda Goebbels murdering her own children so that they don't have to live in a world without National Socialism. That viewer said she wanted to scream at the screen. I felt that way throughout the movie.Are these Nazis human? Yes. Are they sympathetic? I'd be hard pressed to imagine a normal person feeling sympathy for these Nazis. They murder their own children. Hitler is plainly depicted as a twitching failure and a pathetic narcissist who sees even his beloved German people as mere pawns who exist solely to provide greater glory for him.I can't help but compare ""Downfall"" to the ""big"" epic-wanna-be American movies of 2004, from ""The Aviator"" to ""Alexander."" There is just no comparison. Hollywood, watch out.During, and certainly after, the movie my mind raced. Without being at all preachy, this movie invites you to -- no, demands that you -- think about the hero worship that surrounded Hitler. Why did a nation drop to its knees for this lunatic? Why, during Berlin's final hours, didn't more people read the writing on the wall? By extension, the film invites critique of any national psychosis and hero worship. Why did these people surrender themselves to Hitler? Is there any comparison between the events on the screen and contemporary life? In a brief coda, the real Traudl Junge, Hitler's secretary, attempts to acquit herself by saying, paraphrase, ""Gosh, I was a young, pretty girl, what did I know or care about politics?"" But then she interrogates that stance. ""I could have informed myself. I could have learned something. Being young is no excuse."" I left the theater thinking not just about fifty years ago, but about today, about my country's involvement in Iraq, and America's largely passive response to that war."
"Watching DER UNTERGANG is something of a unique experience for me . It's not often I'd go out of my way to watch a foreign film , far less one that is often talkative and where the outcome is in no doubt . Even more remarkable is the fact that I sometimes rewatch this movie from start to end unable to take my eyes off screen . The reason ? It's one of the few films where the acting is truly compelling I heard a lot of controversy about DER UNTERGANG as soon as Bruno Ganz had been cast and together with director Oliver Hirschbiegel they both decided to make a film where every minor detail about Hitler's last days should be totally accurate . They succeeded and that's not only my opinion because every professional historian has remarked that Ganz interpretation is the only truly accurate portrayal of Adolph Hitler . You find yourself unable to take your eyes off screen every time Hitler appears . Also of worthy note is Ulrich Matthes as Joseph Goebbles . Note how often Matthes appears on screen where he doesn't have to say a word , his burning presence is enough to hold the audience attention and radiates great evil . It's almost as if the audience have jumped into a time machine and landed in Hitler's bunker in the spring of 1945 . It's so convincing it's almost enough to give you nightmares I would have happily given DER UNTERGANG 10 out of 10 but it loses a couple of points because of a serious problem and that is the way it somehow tries to make out the people of Nazi Germany are also victims of the Nazi regime . Notice the speech by Goebbles where he sneers he's not interested in the suffering of the German civilian population because "" They voted for us and now their throats will be slit "". If you have little knowledge of European history 1939-45 ( I'm afraid such people are becoming more and more numerous as the years pass ) then you'll find yourself asking why don't the Germans just surrender ? It's easily explained by the fact that the Nazi regime murdered million upon millions of people in Eastern Europe and it's payback time as the red army advances into the heart of the Nazi regime . It's also interesting to note that we never see Soviet soldiers raping German women in their thousands . Again if someone with no knowledge of the period would ask why are the Soviets doing that ? And again the answer is simple - Revenge against a country /regime that was responsible for the deaths of almost 15% of the Soviet population . Don't you get the feeling the film wants to avoid awkward questions ? This type of controversy seems to be responsible for Ganz , Matthes , Hirschbiegel and the film itself being very under rewarded at international film festivals which while being slightly understandable does seem wrong . There is no doubt in my mind that Ganz deserved the Oscar for best actor that year since it's the best performance I've ever seen by a non English speaking actor in a movie . If no one discovers time travel then this will be the closest we'll find out what it was like in the days leading up to the death of history's most hated figure"
"Quite simply, the story of Downfall is of the final days of the third Reich, held up in a bunker in the center of Berlin, as Adolf Hitler and his closest minions go deeper into the hole they've dug for themselves (told through the perspective, for the most part, of Hitler's last secretary Traudl Junge). I'm not sure if it is a great film or not on a first viewing, as it is a highly emotional experience along with it being intellectual at times. It's a complex film with a specific look, and the documentary-style that borders sometimes on being too much (depending on the viewer).One aspect of the film right off that fascinated me was the look. Director Hirschbiegel and DP Rainer Klaussman give scenes (I'm not certain all of them) a certain yellow-greenish tint. Perhaps this world we are seeing is meant to look like a sort of death, in a sickly kind of hue inside and outside the bunker. Or, this is just part of the style of the camera, which is often hand-held, and meant to have a Saving Private Ryan approach to the horrors of warfare. The details of most of the victims (many of which not innocent) of battle wounds or suicides are not sugar-coated with any kind of hyper-kinetic style. It's very straightforward, and all the more shocking. When Hirschbiegel shoots a pan across people (sometimes Children) that are already dead, it's certainly far more jarring than could be expected. Spielberg may try for the gritty, 'no-holds-barred' direction of the horrors of war and Nazism, a filmmaker from the country of its origin has a certain advantage.The story that unfolds in Downfall is of course a doomed one at the start (doomed for everyone in the story, the Nazis and the un-seen millions of victims of Europe included). It would be one thing for the filmmakers to punch up the story of Hitler's demise with melodrama, however an aspect to the film that doesn't cheat the audience (German, American, or otherwise) is that the story is somehow objective on one level, and on another tries to find someone to connect with. Hitler (played by Wim Wenders regular Bruno Ganz) is the key character to the story, but by making the protagonist the secretary the story does have something of a portal for a viewer amid the lot of crazed, trapped characters.Hitler is certainly the cold-blooded, Nietzsche-influenced Fuhrer of the lot, and others such as Eva Braun and the Goebbels are proof that what Hitler had in him was infectious not just with his nation at the outset, but also with his closest followers. His generals argue over what to do. The Russians are closing in. Eva throws a birthday party like it's nobody's business, despite bombs coming through the windows. Nazi commanders turn their backs on the Fuhrer one by one, adding to Hitler's ultimate hypocrisy. One brief exchange between two soldiers that caught my attention went as such, ""Where should we go?"" ""I don't know; some place where we're needed."" Speaking of content, I must come to the point of the performances. While some actors in the soldier roles and female parts were well-cast and notable - Alexandra Maria Lara as Traudl is not too forced, though one may not always find her as sympathetic as the film tries to represent - if Downfall lacked a proper actor for Hitler, it could almost slip into farce (and not the classic kind found in Chaplin or the Three Stooges). Bruno Ganz does what I see only on occasion in based-on-life dramas: he goes so deep into character that one figures that no one else could have been this person in this film. Much like with his followers, when he is in the room in a scene, the attention is all on him, as if he was that most wretched of school-teachers who gained attention through the reptilian parts of your brain. Ganz is never over-doing it when the Fuhrer flips out, and he never makes him seem too unbelievable. In other words every look that gets accentuated in a close-up or in the darkness of a room adds to the tension and horror of the whole situation.When one sees the film upon a first viewing, the story of the Goebbles is likely the most disturbing for any viewer. While Mr. and Mrs. Goebbles' fates are well-documented along with the other monsters, their children's fates make for scenes that bring full circle the insanity of Hitler's own messages- the collapse of compassion, the facade of loyalty and honor, the un-stoppable hatred of Jews and anyone not of 'their' creed, all wrapped together in the climax of the picture.I really was not sure what to expect from a film like this. I wasn't sure if the filmmakers would try and make Hitler seem the least bit sympathetic. They did not. I left the theater with a hatred that possibly spread further, as I take umbrage to his perversion of Nietzsche, and his ironic taste in food (vegetarian dictator, who knew). And one flaw I saw in the film was that even with being open-minded for the aspect of the 'other', from the German's perspective, there were some people and characters presented that I could not find acceptable under the writing and direction (in other words, in a few bits, the stark realism vanished). If there is anything worthy to find in the film though is it's brutally honest about the nature of fascism, and the outcome of the effects it has on a war machine like the one that unfolded with WW2. History may or may not be fogged as to what precisely happened in that bunker, but in a dramatic style not too far of a stretch from Rossellini's own Germany Year-Zero, it's definitely worth a viewing (that is, in the right frame of mind)."
"Wow, what a grim movie. How I stuck with this for 155 minutes, I don't know, but it's a fairly involving story once you get into it and you want to see how it's all played out.A main reason I use the word ""grim"" is that there are more scenes with people committing suicide in this movie than all the movies (thousands) I've seen put together. This German movie deals with the last days Of Hitler and the Nazis in Berlin in April of 1945. In the end, most of the people in the film either kill themselves, as mentioned, or execute their loved ones in order to avoid capture by the Russians, who overtook the city. This includes poisoning a group of young children.While not overly gory, some of the scenes are shocking, ones I suspect would linger in anyone's memory..Bruno Ganz as Adolph Hitler was intriguing, to say the least. As an American, I can recall very few, if any, films in which Hitler was shown to this degree with this much dialog. Being such a famous figure in history, it was one of the reasons, frankly, I stayed with the film. I never this man portrayed on film.Alexandra Maria Lara as ""Traudl Junge"" was the bright spot in this dismal story, a beautiful and wholesome-looking woman with an expressive face. She was the only character in the film that I cared about. Everyone else is pretty cold. Junge ""won"" the job as a secretary for Hitler and is pictured as sweet and naive woman...and just one more of the millions of victims of World War II. Victims can be survivors, too, as the story concludes, if for nothing else, for suffering with a guilty conscience for decades.This war movie definitely can be classified as ""different"" and memorable. I doubt if I'd ever watch this again, but it was worth the one viewing, that's for sure."
"I've always been fascinated with WWII history and specially Hitler's character and his motivations and inner thinking. I found this movie to be a master piece. The actor who plays Hitler has done an outstanding job. In short, the best movie about Hitler I've ever seen. I've also been particularly fascinated about what had gone on in the bunker during those last days. This movie which is supposed to be very close to reality gives a remarkable depiction of what actually went on in there. I also like the fact that the movie, very delicately, concentrates on some other seemingly ""unimportant"" characters, for example the German surgeon in the hospital. Overall, I give this a 10/10 since I have not seen a better movie in this category."
"Adolf Hitler. The very name is enough to send a chill down your spine. Not because of what it is or was, but because of what it stands for, what we involuntarily and immediately think of when we are reminded of him. The deaths of so many people and the cause of so much evil. Now, almost sixty years after his death, we finally get a chance to see his downfall, his last hours and days... and this turns out to be a very revealing portrayal. Oliver Hirschbiegel takes what so many people have tried to turn into a monster and makes it human again, makes us believe that this man actually existed and was a man, not a beast. We see Hitler's frustration at defeat, his kindness to his employees, his refusal to accept the truth. The plot is very good, and almost completely authentic. I could only find two historical inaccuracies in the film, and that is incredible, compared to the amount of stuff that was as if taken directly from the history book or another equally reliable source. The pacing is great. I was hardly bored at any point during the film, despite it being quite long and the language spoken was one I couldn't understand(thank god for subtitles). With that said, I have to applaud this film's realism and authenticity. Every single German character in the film speaks German. There are a few scenes with Russian characters as well... and they naturally speak Russian. Not English with a poorly faked accent, like we generally see in Hollywood films. In fact, there is not really any Hollywood in the film. Just gritty, hard realism. No heroic acts that are rewarded. No 'fireball' explosions. No holding back on injuries, even when it comes to 'our heroes'. Actually, that's probably what impressed me the most(when it comes to non-Hollywood stuff in this film); there are no heroes. No one is raised above the rest, no one is pure, good and true *all the time*... no one is a hero. Everyone is a human being. The acting is flawless. Bruno Ganz is a perfect choice for Adolf Hitler. No, scratch that; THE perfect choice. You forget that you're watching an actor. You're completely absorbed by his performance. The casting was mostly spot-on, with most of the historical characters looking and acting just like they did in real life. The details are another thing that raises this film to a new level. The tiniest little things in these people's lives, the most human and typical things are presented as they are or were, in the film. Hitler's Parkinson's disease, Goebbels' slight limp, etc. Smaller details include a soldier quickly rubbing his eyes of soot and gunpowder before looking through binoculars and a brief dialog showing Hitler and his promises' effect on many Germans, even children. This is just so talented directing, it's hard to say anything negative. The editing is sharp and the cinematography is perfect. Not one shot lasts too long or ends too early. A few things were changed(from the historical record of what happened) for dramatical reasons, but it didn't bother me and probably won't be a deal-breaker for anyone else(it really shouldn't, anyway, except maybe for historians who go for nothing but authenticity and accuracy). The one thing I will say is that no one should go see this movie unless they are absolutely certain of what they're in for, when it comes to violence and realism. This is gratuitous and detailed, no holding back. Not for the faint of heart. Definitely not. Also, you will need somewhat extensive knowledge of Hitler and the people around him in that time, or you won't really understand what is going on. Read up on him or watch a Discovery Channel special first, then watch the film. I recommend this to just about anyone who can tolerate the language(I don't know if there is a dubbed version of this film, but in my honest opinion, you should stay away from any other version than the original) and the violence, and, most importantly, the idea that Hitler was a human being, not some supernatural, cold-hearted monster. 10/10"
"This movie probably provides the best dramatic treatment of Adolf Hitler. Unlike other movies that tend to present Hitler as a caricature, this movie opts to portray Hitler as a historical person and not as a clown. Although it is easy to reduce Hitler to a subject for mockery, this movie avoids that temptation and instead presents an Adolf Hitler the person whose actions are made even more sinister, baffling and amazing by the sheer banality of his existence. In this movie Hitler is shown not as a hysteric, not as the bombastic political actor, leader and rabble rouser familiar in all too many documentaries, but as a frail, broken, disillusioned man whose dreams have been shattered and whose closest advisers have all but abandoned him. Yet, even as Hitler himself realizes that his demise is all but inevitable, the movie shows how the cohort of secretaries, clerks and party flunkies who formed Hitler's personal staff refused to leave him and opted to stay with the Fuhrer to the bitter end. This level of devotion to a failed and doomed head of state is perhaps unprecedented in history. While the Third Reich was crumbling they stayed with the man who was responsible for the destruction of their country. Yet the same man who was capable of ordering the conquest of entire countries and the extermination of entire peoples was also capable of individual acts of kindness that makes his career all the more baffling to the audience. Can the personality and career of Adolf Hitler ever be fully explained? Maybe not, but this excellent movie at least provides a plausible glimpse of what Hitler may have been about and how his dreams of new world order came crashing down.Also, special mention must be made of Bruno Ganz's uncanny resemblance to Adolf Hitler. Mr. Ganz gives what has to be the most outstanding cinematic portrayal of Adolf Hitlee. Mr. Ganz succeeds in portraying Hitler as a caricature and instead provides a credible and even-handed portrayal of a person whose actions have been the cause for the kind of scorn and mockery that obscures who Hitler was as a man."
"As Downfall begins, World War Two and Berlin are already hopelessly lost, but yet Hitler issues orders to imaginary armies, and his cadre of generals never does more than tactfully disagree as millions of civilian lives are deliberately jeopardised to no meaningful end. Downfall shines a hard light into Berlin's bunkers, and illuminates a politics both repugnant, and scary in its proximity to politics we know.The film follows one of Hitler's secretaries, a high-ranking army doctor, Goebbel's wife, a twelve-year old panzer killer, a general encouraging withdrawal from Berlin, and the general defending it. Their stories play out in Berlin's command bunker and through what is left of its streets and buildings. When all of their doings and meetings are put together, one arrives at a rich picture of Berlin's lasts gasps.We see snatches of the ordinary Berliner's war, of the embattled soldier's war, but mostly we look in upon the actions of Hitler's officers, companions, and civilian attachés. We see them execute erratic orders; variously urge or resist a withdrawal from Berlin; prepare to slip away themselves; write last testaments; sit listless; whore; drink and carouse; labour with the wounded; or prepare for their suicide, and perhaps the murder of their family. What emerges is a compelling interrogation of fanaticism.The mind boggles at the naïvety of some of the film's acquaintances, but is most disturbed by the actions of its officer class, who know Hitler's behaviour to be entirely irrational yet observe his orders all the same. Many of his generals value their duty to a madman resolved upon death above the lives of millions; the overwhelming concern of others is self-preservation. Why was their no coup in these last days? That is the question which this film will have your mind screaming.Downfall feels like a fly-on-the-wall documentary, the shots are too well composed and the crew too invisible, but it feels that authentic. The dull grey-green film stock familiar from Saving Private Ryan et. al. helps, but it is the film's remarkable performances, production design, and effects, which really carry the day.In appearance the film is every bit as convincing as Private Ryan, but it is made still more verisimilar by the absence of any sentimental narrative concessions. Downfall doggedly, dispassionately shows the callousness of the war and its key prosecutors. In the bunker one encounters a menagerie of moralities just as distorted as Hitler's. A few of Downfall's scenes are of the most disturbing nature.Hitler is not amongst the characters that the camera loosely follows through the film. His centrality to the action probably wins him the most screen time, but our experience of him includes waiting in anterooms and peering down corridors. Thus, cunningly, the power relations around him are revealed; and we get to listen in to both back room and front room politics.Bruno Ganz's performance is excellent; his Hitler is delusional, tyrannical, and monumentally immoral, but still he conjures some of the charisma and personal kindness that must have seduced those around him. Incredibly, when released in Oz, film critics talked about Downfall's sympathetic portrayal of Hitler: they must have been watching a different film! Ganz is truly repellent; to take his character further would only make it a caricature. His moments of humanity, and his tired physique, only make the whole man more terrible. His portrayal rings true because we can perceive something of how he came to power.Juliane Köhler also makes a powerful impression as a flighty, selfish, unhinged Eva Braun. You might just hate fanatical ice woman Magda Goebbels (Corinna Harfouch) more than her husband before the film's end. But her fanaticism is no more amazing than the determined naivety of secretary Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara); a snippet of the real person talking in interview caps the film. What she says is what most German war survivors now say about their culpability; however, after what you've just seen, one's disbelief at such systematic ignorance is more acute than ever.Downfall is flawlessly executed; the feelings it elicits are intense. It is well deserving of a ten, but one would never call this film entertainment."
"I have to say,Downfall was probably the best movies I have ever seen.Not only did the movie focus on the last days of Hitler,but also the last days of the third Reich.Seeing it through the eyes of one of Hitler's personal secretaries,Traudi Junge,gave me a clearer image of Nazi Germany's downfall.This is one of the very few movies I have seen that I believed I wasn't watching actors on the screen.It was SO real.You see how the members of the bunker have doubts and know they're not going to win.Bruno Ganz as the famous dictator was pure magic on the screen.He was like Hitler reincarnated for the screen.Like no other movie before,I can still remember the scenes vividly.The scenes just stay in my head,so much that i can probably watch the movie in my head.Another thing that made the movie real was the accuracy.Like previous movies about Hitler,they most likely ""twist the plot"" so it can appeal to a large audience.But this movie,they stayed close to the actual story as much as possible.The creators really did their homework on the accuracy thing.I was impressed Hitler wasn't really the main character,because not only do we see his side of the story,but for the first time ever,they show the other members side as well.We see a more definitive take on the whole regime.I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in the last days of Nazi Germany.Der Untergang is cinema at it's best."
"Downfall seeks to chart the final days of the Third Reich as both Germany and Adolf Hitler stand on the brink of collapse, as the Russians advance to the heart of Berlin.It is difficult to gauge whether or not Downfall is a great film or not. It seems that any film offering alternative insight to the Second World War is generally well received as either outstanding (Das Boot, 1981) or at worst, thought provoking and slightly unnerving (Max, 2002), and Downfall is a combination of all these factors.To a certain extent, it's well acted. Bruno Ganz puts in an intense performance as Hitler, his mood swaying from quiet mourning to the brutal ruthlessness we all know him for, as he visibly degenerates as the war takes its toll on his sanity. What is important is that he remains unlikeable. Ganz makes him a bit more human, without engaging the audience on terms of empathy. He isn't seeking sympathy for the Devil, but is creating an accurate portrait of a man with history watching his every move. I know very little about history and the films accuracy, making the other characters simple types for me. They do an effective job but I've got nothing to base them on.Downfall doesn't shy away from the more harrowing scenes of war either, focusing largely on the children drawn into it. Audiences are used to seeing soldiers and civilians die, largely thanks to Steven Spielberg, but seeing Nazi Youth soldiers executed by their superiors before they're killed by the Russians is more than what we're used to. The scene in which Magda Goebbels (Corinna Harfouch) poisons all of her children is the best (not quite the right word) example of this and is obviously chilling, as the innocents are punished for the crimes of their parents, in their sleep, no less. I was very relieved none of them woke up.However, there is no one to root for here. We all know how it ends (although not exactly how) and Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara) is perhaps too simple a character to really engage with. For this reason, Downfall is second best to character based efforts such as Spielberg's Schindler's List (1993) and Polanski's The Pianist (2002).While it is heavy stuff, and more than a little though provoking, there isn't enough emotional connection here for it to be a classic."
"Downfall is a film not without it's flaws but I feel it is one of the most important films I've ever seen. It is so accurate and so unbiased in it's portrayal of Hitler and the final days of his Reich that we get to see the man behind the monster and the people who have sold their soul to him. Nazis weren't beacons of pure evil, they were human beings and Downfall takes this to heart. I remember the film received some criticism upon it's release for being ""sympathetic"" to the Third Reich, sympathy is not the emotion Oliver Hirschbiegel is trying to inset in his audience, I felt he wanted them to develop a sense of understanding.Bruno Ganz is haunting and mesmerizing as Hitler, but the dictator is not the main focus of the film. It is largely an ensemble piece about the fall of Berlin to the Russian army through various perspectives. We see the efforts of an SS Doctor named Ernst Gunther Schneck as he tries to look out for the interests of his fellow Germans and we see that he is most troubled by the SS' indifference to the suffering. There is a very well done subplot about a group of Hitler youth being called into battle because there simply isn't anyone else left. The group of children have been brainwashed and believe that they must fight to the death, and they do despite the pleas of a boy's broken father. To say this is simply a film about Nazi' would be an understatement, it's a film about Germany and the uncertainty of her future.We have little time to catch our breath as we are thrust into the Bunker where the Fuhrer will sit through the destruction of his empire and have to endure a hellish demise. And go through Hell he will, the fortunes of the war shift dramatically for the worse. Hitler sits in his war room moving troops across it which don't exist anymore. His Generals and followers don't know what to think anymore. Some want to continue to place complete faith in Hitler and some believe it is time to end the war. Hitler himself clings onto the slimmest chances that he can lead Germany to victory. He continues to plan for the building of a new model Berlin and seldom does he show his true intentions or thoughts. Only when his closest followers abandon him does Hitler realize that he has no chance of winning the war. We are unsure of what Hitler wants to hang onto, he makes it very clear that he doesn't care about the citizens of Berlin. He sees them as weak and as traitors to their own cause even though they continue to fight to the last man for him. In many ways the Bunker is a surreal area void of reality. In it's walls, Hitler is still a powerful leader and not a weak old man drained by war. The occupants know their fate but they never admit it or bring it up. Eva Braun plans a huge party with dancing and drinking but it is interrupted by powerless due to the firing of Russian artillery, when the power returns Eva doesn't ask if anyone is all right she orders that the music be put back on. Hitler makes a big deal about his killing himself, he is clear that this is the last and only option. When he parts with his secretaries and staff we see Hitler's trademark theatricality. He doesn't speak to any of his followers except for Magda Goebbels, whom he gives his official seal to praising her as the bravest mother in the Reich. Magda later comes to the realization that she would rather kill her young children rather than let them live in a world without their Uncle Adolf and Aunt Eva and National Socialism.In the end the influence of the Third Reich only extended from the mind of a madman to a group of uncertain people buried below the rubble.If Downfall has a main character it is Traudi Junge, Hitler's secretary, played by the beautiful actress Alexandra Maria Lara. This character is the most compelling in the film. She is young and by her own admission she sought a career with the Nazis because she saw an opportunity for advancement. The best scene is when the two central characters are introduced in the beginning of the film, Traudi is applying to be Hitler's secretary. Hitler's introduction into the picture is filmed relatively simply but Ganz' presence is huge and rather Traudi looks like she is looking into the eyes of God. Hitler brings the girl to his office to test her typing skills and he makes small talk about his beloved German Shepard Blondi. Ganz makes him appear like a father figure to the girl, patient and understanding. It is one of the best scenes of the film. The relationship between Traudi and Hitler is handled with utmost care. Traudi is never sure what to think about Hitler, he both repulses and fascinates her. She convinces herself that she sees something past the hate filled rants, she tries to find Hitler's soul. And the audience is brought along on this search. The thought of Hitler having a soul is a tough conundrum to think about, but past the hate,the racism, and the evil was a man who was gentle and understanding with Traudi and who loved his dear old dog Blondi.Showing Hitler and his Third Reich as humans is the best way to respect the sheer evil of the Holocaust. If we think of Hitler as nothing put pure evil we lessen the tragedy and the enormity of humanity's darkest hour. A human being is capable of error and Downfall is about flawed people who allowed themselves to be taken in by a crazy man and how they and the nation of Germany had to pay for their sins"
"Ever since his death in a Berlin bunker at the end of World War II, there has been endless speculation and conjecture surrounding the final days of Adolph Hitler and his long time mistress Eva Braun. A few years back, a documentary entitled ""Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary"" interviewed one of the few people who claimed to be an eyewitness to those events, a young woman hired to take dictation for Der Fuehrer for the last two and a half years of his life. ""Downfall"" is a dramatized account of what she saw.Indeed, this new film begins and ends with clips from that earlier work, in which a now aged Traudl Junge attempts to explain why she allowed herself to become a devotee of both Hitler and the Nazi party (she chalks it up, basically, to ""curiosity""). After that brief preamble, ""Downfall"" plunges us immediately into that hellish time when the world lay in ruins and The Third Reich was breathing its long overdue final gasp.The beauty of ""Downfall"" is not merely that it affords us a glimpse into one of the most fascinating bits of 20th Century history, but that it opens up aspects of human nature that we may not always wish to acknowledge. It shows Hitler as a man accustomed to being able to control events and the people around him suddenly rendered impotent in the face of a force - in this case the Russian army battering away at Germany's capital city - greater than himself. As events spiral more and more out of control, the dictator becomes ever more paranoid and divorced from reality (by the end he's issuing orders to an army that , quite literally, no longer exists). For him, the world suddenly divides itself up into those who will remain loyal and faithful to the bitter end and those who will become traitors both to him and to the ""glorious cause"" that defined their lives for so many years. For one thing the movie is clear to acknowledge is that, even in his final moments, Hitler remains unrepentant and convinced that not only was he right in what he did, but that future generations would come to recognize that rightness and honor him for it. In many ways, this is the story of any failed dictator whose dreams of worldwide domination end in the smoldering ruins of his own hubris.But it is not merely Hitler who exhibits bizarre behavior in the face of onrushing doom. Even though most of the people who have chosen to remain in the bunker with their leader are fully aware of the fate that awaits them, they maintain many of the rituals and accoutrements of ""civilized,"" ""gracious"" living: they hold dances, sing patriotic songs, drink champagne from crystal glasses, read magazines, all the while calmly discussing the ideal way to kill themselves. Despite their fear, they are so caught up in the vision and the man to whom they have sworn allegiance that they are willing to die - and take their children with them into death - rather than live in a world without their beloved Fuehrer.The makers of ""Downfall"" run the risk common to any work that attempts to provide a three-dimensional portrait of Hitler: the accusation that they are trying to ""humanize"" a man whose epic disregard for human life puts him in the category of the greatest monsters who ever lived. And, indeed, the movie does show Hitler displaying moments of warmth and tenderness, mainly aimed towards the women in his life (and, of course, his dog). Yet, who among us really believes that Hitler NEVER showed affection to those who were close to him? It was the fact that he COULD treat the people he loved in this way yet was unable to extend that same sense of empathy and concern to the faceless, nameless millions he slaughtered that made him the true incarnation of evil on earth.The film also does a great job showing the varied reaction of Hitler's military commanders as they argue back and forth over whether to level with him about the hopelessness of the situation and thereby risk incurring his wrath or to continue to feed his delusions and let him go out thinking he was still master of his fate.The performances are all first rate, but I would like to single out especially the lively and vivacious Juliane Kohler who manages to make Eva Braun's blind devotion to a murderous madman and fearlessness in the face of death touching, understandable, and - dare I say it? - strangely heroic. As Junge, Alexandra Maria Lara shrewdly portrays a woman whose own devotion to the man and the cause is tempered by a certain degree of rationality and fear, to the point where she can ask, in a moment of candor, how Hitler can be so kind on a personal level, yet so brutal in his comments and actions. And, of course, Bruno Ganz gives a bravura performance as Hitler, running the gamut from full-throttle mania to tender solicitude while never losing sight of the man at the core.Despite being set in the past, ""Downfall"" has a great deal of relevance to our own time. To see Magda Goebbels methodically and systematically poisoning each one of her own children before having herself killed is to understand a little better how family men can fly planes filled with innocent men, women and children into skyscrapers. It's a scary and sobering sight indeed. Now if only we as a species could learn some of the lessons put forth by this film."
"This film should be shown in schools. I think that the Nazi party has always been something that is difficult for children to grasp, to horrific to be real. This film gives them a humanity that had been long overdue, and, in doing so, makes you realise how lucky we are that they were defeated. Bruno Ganz and Thomas Kretschmann put in the best performances for me, all though there was no member of the cast that I could find fault with. Schindlers List is an excellent film, but the Nazi's in that are inhumane monsters. In this film (as in The Pianist, again with Thomas Kretschmann), the humanity makes the drama all the more gripping and truthful. This world should never forget the Second World War, and i hope that this film will still be shown to all in many years time. A masterpiece"
"It may not be entertaining, Leo Di Caprio may not be in it, there may be no no melodrama, no fake emotions, no Hollywoodisation of History for American audiences, but Der Untergang is certainly one of the best period films ever. Hitler, the most odious figure in History, is portrayed not in a sympathetic way but as he was: a man, persuaded that he was doing the right thing; with painstaking realism, and aided by one of the most riveting performances ever, the film shows us that there is a monster inside every one of us, living side by side with more gentle traits. Superlative acting, awesome script, overwhelming presentation of the subject matter: a near-perfect cinematic experience."
"I have seen many films about both world wars, some were good and some bad...but Downfall seems to me, in my opinion, the most intense, deepest, and strongest movie about the demise of Hitler and the end of the European theatre.Bruno Ganz portrays Adolf Hitler as if he were Hitler himself. The gestures, mannerisms, even the look would literally give an intense fright to anyone if he walked into a room where no one knew who Ganz was. So much of the story follows the real story of life in the bunker, in and around Berlin, April 1945. The film grips you with clutches of paranoia, fear, and the unknown. It is truly one of those movies that you have to truly appreciate history to understand the complexity of Germany at the final end. It is not an ordinary ""ding dong the Führer's dead"" movie; it's a compelling and to-the-point one you never want to get up and go pee kind.Very sharp, deep, and intense. Definitely a buy and keep for any military or history nostalgia buff."
"For those unfamiliar with the film, Downfall portrays the last two weeks of the Nazi government flitting from the bunker beneath the Chancellery to the civilian bomb shelters to the embattled streets of the ruined capital.It's astonishing achievement is to put a human face to some of the most infamous figures in history; it strips away the stereotypes and hyperbole and absurd dramatics to let you see the people behind the caricatures without diminishing the horrors they wrought. It brings home the meaning of Hannah Arendt's chilling phrase, ""the banality of evil"". Yet the film never descends into banality for more than a few minutes, and always to contrast it with the chaos and brutality that evil engenders.Bruno Ganz is brilliant in his portrayal of Hitler; you can see the charm and charisma that won people to him and the monster that dwelt within. Unlike earlier portrayals which dwelt on the injections and sera he used, Ganz shows a palsied dictator with full command of his intellect (if not his emotions) right to the end. This is more horrifying than seeing a drug-addled psychopath as has become stereotypical in movies on the Third Reich... though sometimes the horror takes time to settle in, as it did for many who met the dictator in person. Ganz's Hitler is not mad but deeply in denial of the consequences of his actions and so wed to his doctrine of the fuererprincip that he is incapable of understanding defeat. His chilling switches between compassion for those in his immediate surroundings and utter ruthlessness towards everyone else are made all the more terrifying as a result, as is his repeated refusal to shoulder any blame for the disasters and desertions around him.As is entirely appropriate, the film focuses on Hitler; however, it does so mainly through the eyes of his private secretary Traudl Junge (played by Alexandra Maria Lara). The film begins and ends with a voice-over by the real-life Junge (not to be missed) and the action starts by showing, as a prologue, the young Junge's application and interview for the job in 1942. We see in her the unthinking loyalty shown to her leader, often against her better judgment; though she plainly wishes to leave the bunker, she finds herself unable to do so until after the dictator's suicide. Lara's performance is overshadowed by Ganz's but this is no reflection upon her skills; and once we see her leave the Bunker we get a much clearer demonstration in her acting ability as she navigates the ruins to safety.We see the horrors of the final battle primarily through the character of Peter Krantz (Donevan Gunia), a twelve-year-old awarded with the Iron Cross in Hitler's last birthday review of the troops for destroying two Soviet tanks. Krantz's desperate eagerness to strike at the enemy gives way, after a final and horrible defeat, to a child-like retreat to home and family only to see it torn apart; the irony is that it's not at the hands of vengeful Russian troops, but by Nazi vigilantes punishing ""desertion"" and disloyalty.Juliane Kohler's Eva Braun shows just how shallow and banal people in high places can get. A party girl trapped in a holocaust, we see her cling to alcohol and music and routine distractions to shut out the horror. More horribly, she succeeds... her stunning (and yet entirely believable) reversal from weeping petitioner when her brother-in-law is about to be shot for desertion to obedient bride of Hitler takes the breath away. Kohler doesn't let us see much of what's inside Braun simply because there's so little there in the character; Braun is an empty shell who fills herself with the attention of others, a mere veneer of vivacity around a human void as shown by her chatty final testament (narrated over a sequence of soldiers and civilians dying brutally in the rubble above).Diametrically opposed, yet in strange harmony, is Corinna Harfouch's portrayal of Magda Gobbels. She is coldly intelligent and powerful yet entirely subservient to her fuehrer. Her poisoning of the children to ""save"" them from a world without Nazism is gut-churningly impossible to shut out; her shrugging off of a comforting touch by husband Joseph Gobbels (Ulrich Matthes) afterward followed by a studious application to a game of solitaire is just as wrenching, as is her pathetic final plea to a suicidal Hitler to flee the city. Matthes' doctrinaire yet emotional portrayal of the Propaganda Minister is also chilling, as is his strange helplessness and inability to face the deaths of family and leader.The other performances in the film are all excellent; I only avoid mentioning further details to keep the length of this review manageable. See the film to see the dedication of the doctors within and the bizarre mix of power and powerlessness, courage and poltroonery, and insight and vapidity in the assembled generals.The set dressing is thorough and good; militaria enthusiasts will see great attention to detail shown in the costuming, though alas there are some minor deficits in equipment that admittedly only those who have studied the period closely will notice. The sound is superbly authentic.I'll wind this down by saying that the movie succeeds in its goal of bringing home the human face of an inhuman tragedy. I won't forget this film."
"Having watched ""Der Untergang"" just yesterday, this movie is pretty far from being out of my mind. And I predict that it will stick with me for a few days more, if not weeks. After the end credits the entire theater just sat there, speechless. I was in awe. I had trouble believing what I just saw, has actually happened once. This movie is no crowd-pleaser. It is devastating to watch and the cruelty in this movie is almost unbearable.When Goebbels' wife killed her 6 children I was crying my eyes out - it was like someone had ripped my heart out and was stomping on it. I wanted to jump up and shout: ""STOP, you stupid, stupid, retarded B*TCH!!!!"". That scene is the single most heartbreaking scene, I have ever seen. And I have seen my share of scenes aspiring to tears.But after all, this movie should be seen by everyone. We need to remember that all the good things about life are not given facts. We need to fight for them each day. It starts with ourselves."
"""Downfall"" is a fascinating and compelling look at the mindset of the German people at the end of WWII, inspired mostly by the firsthand account of one of Hitler's secretaries who survived the madness that was his bunker in those last days. Here we have an excellent performance from Bruno Ganz as Adolph Hitler, who shows the man's insanity, inhumanity, and his cunning way with people in his intimate circle that allowed him to seduce those around him and the German population at large. Even as everything was falling apart he still had both men and women falling at his knees begging for his next proclamation and willing to follow any order her decreed. In the end, the crushing defeat of his grand ideals, coupled with his irrational hatred for Jewish people that is actually a projection of his own inner hatred for himself and Germany (""The Germans seal their own fate. I have no sympathy for the so-called civilians,"" he says towards the end of days), lead him into paranoid despair and eventual suicide. Likewise, we get a searing performance from Julian Kohler (a fantastic actress best known for her lead in ""Nowhere in Africa"") as Eva Braun, representing perfectly the German elite seduced by the promises of a Utopian Third Reich, and who are in utter and complete denial of the horrors around them right up to the last minute as everything they fought for comes spiraling down into their own self-made hell.One of the few flaws of the film is that it can't decide at times whether to be a straightforward docu-drama (there are often too many of Hitler's inner circle to keep track of) or a soaring WWII epic (there's some compelling subplots revolving around Hitler's youth movement added for dramatic effect). While it may not reach the sublime artistic ideals of ""The Pianist"" or have the emotional heft of ""Schindler's List"" or ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""Downfall"" deserves a place next to those films for it's unique perspective, for better or worse, on one of the most influential men of the last hundred years and the defining moments of the 20th century."
"It has been months since Der Untergang first premiered. For one reason or another, I kept postponing it, month after month, country after country. Luck dictated I should see it on May 9th 2005, in Hannover, Germany. The 60th anniversary of the Armistice in Europe. The day we celebrate an united Europe (that same Europe that Robert Schumman kicked-off in the 50s and still works in preventing further wars). To make it clear: I am not German. Yet, for more than a few reasons, the history of the Second World War always touched me in a particular way. Not that it was any different from so many other wars. Except for the numbers. Never did human cruelty climbed to such levels. Never did we realize as then, how easy can society mutate into a monster. This was a highly intense movie to watch. Bruno Ganz will for ever be remembered as the magisterial actor that played Hitler - as Ben Kingsley is remembered for Gandhi. We see him in this film as a madman. There is no other way to describe it. He was insane. An insane man led the world to collapse, brought Humanity to its knees, and did so unquestioned. Der Untergang is full of strong imagery - it shouldn't matter if those in the streets were German or not. The human misery is total. I could not contain my tears in many occasions (not titanic tears, rather those that come from the depth, those that imply something beyond the screen. tears of History). In others, I simply had to close or cover my eyes, so brutal were the scenes. And as we come to an end, I am, as viewer, left with a sense of emptiness. The credits came, ran for 10 minutes, and I just sat there, crying compulsively for 10 minutes. Not due to the film, but to all that is behind it.As I exited the theatre, I noticed a few other people drying their faces. Outside, the cold had returned. The wind blew strong and icy, some rain drops fell on me. And I walked. I wandered in the cold rain for one hour. I can only think of two other films that left me this disoriented, this helpless.It should never happen again. Never."
"I have a friend that does something she calls ""art therapy."" So calls it art because it uses the same material artists do and produces similar artifacts. When other people do this, I accept it as art, meaning that I allow it to penetrate all of my inner selves it can and make whatever changes it may. After all, aren't all artists engaged with their work in messy, tearful, dangerous ways?But with my friend, it is different. I know how she is damaged. I know why and a bit of how she produced her paintings. The artifact comes to me with that context. Her relationship to it is embossed on my relation to it, so it cannot dissolve into my soul. It only knows the pores of her soul. I suppose if I wanted to somehow re-enact her life it would be useful, but in truth, her stuff is useless to me. More than useless, because I can make art out of neutral found items, but hers aren't neutral.One could say that I might see her demons, but I defy anyone to examine that closely and believe it true. It is not the nature of therapy to serve things for others.I thought of my sad friend all throughout this film. Yes, it is skillfully produced in many ways. Yes, if you pull out this performance or that, you can admire decisions the actors have made. But films are not performances, they are narratives that resonate or not.This is one of the grand therapeutic gestures the Germans are making to resolve the past and distance themselves from it. The twists of character, certain embellishments of phrase, placement of the designated watcher all got in the way for me. I knew that this was a dialog Germans were having with themselves that I was eavesdropping on and grasping for a reason why.But having invested in it, both in time and emotional exercise, it does give me some value.Hitler intuited the role of ceremonial theater, of defining the narrative for a people. He only allowed choreographed films and photos, and never in private moments when he wasn't performing. His most important adviser was Speer, a dramatist who found and designed the stage for the superman. Speer was the most effective dramatist in history, measured by immediate deaths at least. Speer and Reifenstahl created the first effective political propaganda film, a masterpiece by any measure.Until the end, Speer as stage manager orchestrated the drama. He enters this story at the beginning, telling his man that he needs to be ""on the stage when the curtain comes down."" Later, when it really is, he visits his actor and tells him to spare the German people (which is denied as much as Hitler can). I get the feeling that this movie was as much directed by Speer to save the people as anything else he did. So within the drama, we have the director, the designated watcher (our doubly seen stenographer), and historical characters playing not so much those characters but well established German stereotypes. All in all, the construction is clever, and the execution slick. But it is therapeutic art. And we know it, and why it exists, and the specific damage associated with it. So even though it looks like art, it cannot be. It cannot change us.See ""Conspiracy"" for something from this era that perhaps could. Shucks, I see my comment for that has been deleted.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching. The film."
"What a brilliant movie. It showed just facts, that the Germans were not only bastards, but humans too. It grasped the audience in silence from the beginning until the end of the movie. It was overwhelming. Nodbody spoke or caught during the whole movie! that's unbelievable. It is definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen. It es even better than Das Boot and definitely better than the LOTR (that movie sucked!) Anyway, you MUST have seen this movie at least once, and probably the first time you see this movie, it will grasp you in silence too. How the movie is build up is excellent, how the actors set their characters is amazing, you will believe that it must has happened in this way. A lot of research must have be done to come to this product and all that research paid off. If somebody ever says that he did not liked this movie, he is either not telling the truth or he is British :P Fact is, like mentioned before. It is overwhelming"
"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)It was agreeable to see Hitler reduced to a bent, defeated, raving madman, and there is no question that Bruno Ganz looked the part. The endearments he gave to the children and to his bunker mates contrasted horrifically with his plan for them and his ""love"" for the German people. In a sense the way the final days are presented in this film reminded me of what the victims of the Nazis suffered, and that was also apropos and agreeable. Still most people do not like to see human suffering even to those who may, by all that is right, have it coming; and so it was essentially a depressing experience to watch this film.Alexandria Maria Lara, who played Hitler's last personal secretary, Traudl Junge, provided the only bright spot in this necessarily grim picture. She is a fine actress, but somehow she seemed too normal, too smart actually to be the sort of worshipful underling that she must have been. Incidentally, it is from the book by the real Traudl Junge, Biz sur letzten Stunde, and from Joachim Fest's Der Untergang that this movie was adapted. The fine screenplay was written by Bernd Eichinger. Junge appears at the beginning of the film from an interview in 2001, a year before her death, to say a few words and at the end where she explains that she is essentially not that naive young person she once was who should have looked further than the fuhrer's face to see what was really going on. But she was with Hitler for three years and knew his philosophy well. Truth is she was so pleased to be his secretary that she turned a deaf ear to the truth that was in front of her.Of course she was hardly the only one. An entire nation was seduced and led down the path to genocide, humiliation, starvation, near-starvation, and ignominious defeat. One thing the film does to help us understand how this could have happened is to show the blind loyalty that even some of the highest ranking officers felt toward Hitler regardless of his bumbling, his stupidity and his blatant disregard for the feelings and lives of anyone who got in his way--his essential immorality. Some say there was something in the German character that accounts for this blind obedience to authority regardless of how corrupted and evil that authority might be. Maybe in a more pluralistic and multicultural society something like this could not happen. There might be something to that, but I doubt it. Too many monsters have grown in too many different soils and in so many different cultures, I am persuaded it could happen anywhere, but perhaps not as easily and as completely as it happened in Germany.It is interesting that Oliver Hirshbiegel, who directed, did not show the Red Army atrocities as they stormed into Berlin. I don't think he wanted to dilute the sense of the moral culpability of the German people.I was also struck by Hitler's obsession with loyalty. This is how all dictators, warlords and, unfortunately, some respected heads of state operate: they demand unquestioned loyalty, and they ruthlessly eliminate anyone they suspect of anything but that unquestioned loyalty while rewarding the loyal. And so in such governments the head of state becomes surrounded by sycophants and toadies who tell him what he wants to hear and who live in fear of their own lives should they somehow be seen as disloyal. Indeed they sneak around trying to undermine others in other to protect themselves. They live in secrecy amid lies, intrigue and murder.The film is long, 155 minutes, the bunker is dreary and most of the characters are sickies of the worse sort. We as an audience are reduced to those who see inside a cave, the floor covered with bat guano crawling with despicable creatures who feed off of one another. The stench is overwhelming. We watch transfixed for a while at the ugly, unsavory spectacle and then we turn away.Can it happen again? Can it happen here? Let's hope not, but that freedom that the right assures us is not free requires more than loyalty. It requires vigilance and a willingness to speak out, the kind of vigilance that can see the danger when the government begins to deal almost exclusively in lies and misinformation, that invades other countries for dubious gain, deals in propaganda and points fingers at perceived enemies and promotes only those loyal to the leader instead of those most qualified.(I said I would write this review without mentioning a certain personage, and I did, but the allusions are probably more than obvious.) See this for veteran Swiss-German actor Bruno Ganz who gave a fine performance as Hitler."
"A important film for discover the image of a time without shadows of propaganda or preconceptions.A important film for see Hitler not like supreme monster but like small man at end of ambition.A important film for explore of different faces of reality, for understand the personal truth like ordinary form of self-protection.A film about the corpse of an ambiguous era, about the shards of a lie, about death and duty, about closed worlds and anatomy of fear, about fake myths and foolish hope, about sense of life and signification of final gestures.It is a movie, a splendid movie about fall of Nazi regime. In same measure, it is touching description of any dictator crush, about dissolution of a powerful image and Utopian project.The presence of Alexandra Maria Lara is more than a brilliant acting example. The sensitivity, the look, the relation with a twilight universe are amazing.And Bruno Ganz... . After memorialistic literature, documentaries and commentaries, after testimonies and description, for first time I saw the image behind the masks and verdicts.Hitler as victim, Hitler between worlds, Hitler like ""pater familias"", Hitler like shadow of a strange powerful myth.After the end of film must read the testimony of Traudl Junge. The colors of honest confession, the images and the characters transforms ""Der Untergang"" not in a war story but in a special form of catharsis."
"It has sometimes been said that because men no longer believed in the Devil, God created Adolf Hitler to serve as a symbol of absolute evil. This film, which tells the story of the last few days of World War II in Europe, largely seen from the perspective of Hitler and members of his inner circle as the victorious Russian army approaches the gates of Berlin, avoids that concept and tries to show us Hitler the man rather than Hitler the devil. It has been criticised in some circles for that approach, but in my opinion the criticism is not a valid one. Hitler was precisely that- a man, no less human for also being evil. We will never succeed in understanding the crimes of the Nazis if we persist in trying to see Hitler as the spawn of Satan or as some bizarre, inhuman alien being. He was, in Nietzsche's words, menschlich, allzu menschlich. (Human, all too human).To make someone seem human is not necessarily to make them seem sympathetic, but we must remember that Hitler had succeeded in obtaining more than 40% of the vote in free elections, had won the fanatical loyalty of millions of Germans and had succeeded in retaining the loyalty of many of them even when it seemed obvious that his cause was lost. (We see some of that loyalty reflected in the film, especially among the fanatical young soldiers prepared to fight to the death). If he had been an obviously evil psychopath he would never have done any of those things, but would have remained the leader of a tiny movement on the lunatic fringe of German politics, winning the loyalty of only a small fraternity of kindred spirits. He could not have succeeded without possessing immense reserves of charm and charisma.This film tries to show some of the characteristics which helped Hitler in his rise to power. We see him being kind to his secretary, Traudl Junge, on whose memoirs the film was partly based, affable and friendly to the young soldiers he decorates for their desperate acts of bravery, affectionate to his dog Blondi and loving to his mistress Eva Braun. (We like to think that, sexually, Hitler must have been either abnormally perverted or abnormally repressed because we do not like the idea that so monstrous an individual had a fairly mundane sex life, a monogamous heterosexual relationship with an attractive blonde girlfriend).We do, of course, see far more of the opposite side of his character. By the end of the war Hitler had lost all contact with reality, and when we first see him he is unrealistically optimistic, believing that the German army will still succeed in driving the Allies back, issuing commands to non-existent fighting units and even congratulating himself on his strategic skill which has led the enemy into a trap. Later, when even he cannot deny the imminence of defeat, he falls into self-pity, raging against the cruelty of fate or against the German people who have proved unworthy of him. We see that he was not only brutal towards his own enemies but also completely callous towards his own people, refusing to surrender and not caring how many more lives might be lost. The role of Hitler must be one of the most difficult that any actor could be called on to play, but Bruno Ganz meets the challenge magnificently. He meets the physical demands of the role, bringing out Hitler's strong Austrian accent and the paralysed arm tucked behind his back. (Hitler had been injured in a failed assassination attempt the previous year). More importantly, he also rises to its emotional demands, showing the mixture of reckless optimism and despair, impotent rage, hatred and and self-pity which characterised the Fuehrer in his last days. The one thing, however, that Hitler never does is to express any sort of contrition for his crimes, which means that although he is human he is never pitiable.We also see the moral blindness of the rest of Hitler's circle. The most chilling is Corinna Harfouch's portrayal of Magda Goebbels, wife of the infamous propaganda minister, who calmly poisons her own children because she does not want them to grow up in a world without National Socialism. Himmler, as deluded as his leader, vainly hopes that he can negotiate a separate peace with the Western powers that will leave him in power. Albert Speer, more realistic, sees that the war is lost and tries in vain to persuade Hitler to surrender, but he too fails to realise that it is the crimes of the Nazis, in which he played his part, that have brought this disaster upon Germany. Some relief is provided by Alexandra Maria Lara as the naive young Traudl; we also see excerpts from interviews with the real Traudl Junge towards the end of her life, when she confesses that neither her youth nor her naivety can excuse her failure to realise the true nature of the regime she served.This is a bleak, grim film, set against scenes of a ruined city, with an ever-present sense of death and destruction. It is, however, a brave and powerful film which should be seen not only by anyone with an interest in the history of the Second World War but also by anyone who wants to understand the roots of human evil. No-one who has really watched it could make the mistake of considering it pro-Nazi. Oliver Hirschbiegel is to be congratulated for confronting this dark chapter in his nation's history with such courage and honesty. Congratulations are also due to Channel 4 for flying in the face of the British public's normal disdain for foreign-language films when they recently showed this important film at peak evening viewing time. 9/10"
"'Please, retain your faith in the final victory! If you lead us, we will follow!' By the time these words are spoken to Adolf Hitler it is far too late for him to be able to reassure the hysteric woman who said them. He knows, as all his Generals know, that World War II is over. And Germany has lost. However, as his mental stability declines Hitler will forget this and try, once again, to win. Moving forces that exist only on his map and calling in strikes by planes that were destroyed months earlier, Hitler fights until his last to protect the crumbled remains of what was once his evil empire. He pores over models that represent the new cities he believes he will build, and no one has the courage to tell him that his Aryan Xanadu will never exist as anything but these models.This is ""Der Untergang (The Downfall)"". The film is inspired by the memoirs of Traudl Junge, Hitler's last secretary and oblivious follower. Traudl stands at the Fuhrer's side and refuses to move despite lacking all knowledge of him, even his Holocaust. The confused young woman watches in horror as Hitler's Generals turn their backs on him, and she weeps when she finds the remains of her leader's brains scattered across a wall following a fateful gun shot.""Downfall"" has a tricky goal: to show the human side of Hitler. No, it's not about making you sympathize with him. It's about showing that he wasn't some superhuman. Bruno Ganz's performance as Hitler, one of the towering performances in cinema history, exposes faults in the Fuhrer. Physically, his hands twitch uncontrollably and his back is hunched as if burdened with a massive load of shame and humiliation. Mentally, he rants about wanting to speak to soldiers he knows are dead and he fabricate stories about Nazi forces hiding in Prussia, waiting to rush in and save Germany from encroaching Russian armies. As he tells these stories to his friends and confidants, you can see he is telling them to reassure himself, and not his friends.Then comes the final collapse. Hitler shoots his wife, Eva Braun, and then himself so as to prevent being captured and forced to face the music. Magda Goebells poisons her children, and then sits down to a game of solitaire before facing her own death. Joseph Goebells tries to salvage the German army, but finally gives in and shoots his wife and himself. Slowly but surely, every one of the Nazi officers in Hitler's bunker commits suicide.Traudl finally accepts that it is over, and joins the German army as it moves to the front lines to surrender. Finally, she passes through the Russian front. While she may have lived in freedom physically, it is doubtful she ever escaped the mental image of what she saw, and the horrible truth she learned about her Fuhrer's crimes.While we may have heard many ex-Nazi's and Nazi sympathizers claim to be oblivious to Hitler's true evil, Traudl Junge is the only one I'd ever believe. When the real Traudl appeared on screen at the end of the film and said she never knew of the Holocaust until the war ended, I felt sympathy for her and I understood the power Hitler had to blind young people and lead them astray.""Downfall"" has been surrounded by controversy since it debuted at the Toronto film festival last year. Critics said it sympathized too much with Hitler, which is obviously not true when you watch it. Others said it goes too far in it's depiction of Hitler's last days. Perhaps some people can not handle the sight of exploding heads and severed limbs, but to say this film goes too far is insane. How should this film depict it's subject? With sunshine and lollipops? World War II was brutal and, as such, so should any film depicting it be. Some people won't be able to handle it, but that's why we humans have discretion. We can decide what is okay for ourselves, and we can say no to whatever we think is bad for us. You don't have to watch this film.""Downfall"" is a vivid, graphic, firsthand reminder of the depth of Hitler's evil. It's makers are simply spreading the message that trying to forget evil will not change it's affect on us. Why shouldn't we depict Hitler in art the way ""Downfall""'s makers have? It might be easier to live without thinking of him and seeing his human traits, but it wouldn't be any better to live that way.This film should become required viewing for history classes."
"I call this the ""Passion of the Anti-Christ"" because there are, although strained, similarities in how this movie effect me.This movie is about a character from history that is larger than history. Hitler has become a symbol of evil, and certainly I am not the first person to place Adolf Hitler as the ultimate nemesis anti-Christ. But this is the surface of this movie.Underneath, this movie is about the German people. The ability of one man to take advantage of the post-WWI trauma of a culture and manipulate it until the lines of compassion and inhumanity become blurred. Conformity and hypocrisy were not the only traits of the German people.I have always been unable to create a scenario in which I could see how anyone could justify Hilter's world as a good thing. Even with the fear of the power of the Nazi party, the end of war should have given those with fear of the government should have been emboldened.But this portrayal creates a very real world. There were those in Hitler's inner circle who were fanatical followers, but that was not true of everyone. What we do see is a culture who in its last days floundered to grasp onto any hope-- hope to keep out the Russians, hope to keep the national pride that Hitler brought them from the ashes of a great depression, and the hope that the continued blind faith they gave to the ""Fuhrer"" would take them through.It was amazing that even in the last hours of Hitler's life the power he commanded. Even in his seemingly ""normal"" understated life those closest to him worshiped him.In his ""work life,"" generals would bicker and plead with their leader on the last moments to end the insanity, but never once disobeyed an order, even when it was to submit themselves to be shot.Just like ""the Passion,"" there is a message there that is important to us as humans. It is a warning about the tragedy of man and our ability to give our free will up in exchange for group think. It is also a message that evil is only the face of the movement, and that the people behind the mask are just like you and me.The fact that anyone has the potential to be evil. Even worse, that we can all delude ourselves that the horror within can easily be confused for passion, loyalty, and good.It is a hard movie to watch, because it is so well done that it is easy to look past the iconic mustache, swastikas and clicking heels and look at a people much like ourselves and think ""There but by the grace of God go I."""
"I just saw this film yesterday, after listening to violent reactions on the radio. Here in Argentina there's a big Jewish community and it had a big impact. One of the presenters of a radio program was very offended by the fact that there were a lot of deaths depicted in the film but the actual moment when Hitler shoots himself wasn't. The man wanted to see it, needed it for his own satisfaction! That's disturbing, knowing there's so much hate going around, and in persons too young to ever have had direct contact with the facts in question. That implies that someone older took a lot of work in implanting that hate. That's frightening. On the film, I think the great thing about this film is you can see a person or persons who have undergone a process of dehumanization and indoctrination that at the time point of the movie is completely irreversible, and they acknowledge they have no future in a project different than theirs. Hitler makes clear at several points that he chose to construct himself as such a person, and in the end he is nearly delusional, unable to separate the fatherland from his own personna, but remaining a human being when he's not concerned with matters of state. That makes his craziness much more believable, almost schizophrenic. On the whole, you see masses brainwashed by propaganda, some of them wanting blindly to be brainwashed, some accepting it warmly because of a sense of security. That is the story of Junge, as most of the others. I think that's the fatherland concept, you know you can relax and enjoy your country because there's a hard guy in the government that cares for you, and if you support him without asking too much, things will be great for you and the likes of you. I think it's good to see that in a global context. The moral for me is that when in a tragic national situation people look for comfort, they'd rather accept propaganda that makes them feel secure and positive rather than question from their own points of view. So blocks of power are formed on stereotypes and propaganda, and measures taken in the end that no ordinary person would avail in a day to day basis, but the death of individual unbiased thinking ends up like that."
"I absolutely love this movie. The audience is thrown into the final days of the war in Europe and is forced to accept a person who history has declared a monster and must realize that he was a human with all of those emotions. The writing, directing, and the acting especially by Bruno Ganz were incredible. Adolf Hitler was a human who not only made the appalling decisions that wiped out millions of people, but he also was a man who cared enough about his secretary to make sure she was out of Berlin to avoid Communist rule with the Soviets. In my opinion, ""Downfall"" is a must see movie for everyone and one of the best movies of all time as well as probably the best acting performance of all time. The story is about the final days of Adolf Hitler in his bunker as the Soviet Army is encircling what is left of the city of Berlin. It is shown through the eyes of one of Hitler's personal secretaries, Traudl Junge, played by Alexandra Maria Lara (TV-Doctor Zhivago,) who is completely loyal to Hitler. Junge is staying loyal even though Hitler's closet allies are abandoning him. Hitler, played masterfully by Bruno Ganz (The Manchurian Candidate,) is almost bi-polar in the final days. One moment, he is the historical monster the audience as grown to know as we watch he tell his generals that there are large German armies outside of Berlin who are going to rescue him, then screaming at them when they don't. Then you see a Hitler that is concerned about his friends and the people who have worked for him, telling people to leave Berlin because the war is lost. I am not aware of another movie that has shown that kind of a Hitler. After Hitler commits suicide, the rest of the story focuses on Joseph Goebbels short command of Germany, the murder or his own children, his death, and Junge's escape out of Berlin. Quite possibly the greatest performance by an actor, Bruno Ganz delivers us an Adolf Hitler that society is not ready to embrace. Ganz acting decisions to show us a human Hitler with emotions of kindness, compassion, and love, is completely different than the Hitler history has showed us. There are two scenes that show the greatness of his performance. The first scene is when Hitler is being told by the his architect, Albert Speer, that he had not obeyed Hitler's orders for quite sometime even though his personal loyalty never wavered. Hitler was furious but all he did was break his pencil, refused to shake his hand, and shed a tear. To show a monster with emotions is a powerful statement, especially the emotion of sadness, not just betrayal. Another scene that was powerful to me was when Junge walked into Hitler's room and he was sitting there with very little light looking at a painting of Otto Von Bismarck. The scene was almost spiritual in that he was sitting there and looking for answers in a calm and still fashion. It is Impossible to imagine the Hitler in history books that was this peaceful, but that is exactly how he was portrayed, at peace. Ganz makes many risks on this character and succeeds on ever one. Not since George C. Scott's portrayal of Patton have I seen an actor become the character he was portraying, Bruno Ganz was Adolf Hitler. Director Oliver Hirschbiegel did not make a wrong choice. While inside the bunker, you felt Closter phobic and never safe from the artillery shells bouncing of the ground, outside you weren't safe and you knew that the longer you stayed outside, the sooner you would become causality. His action scenes were intense, say a step below Saving Private Ryan. Two great scenes that he shot involved the young children defending the city. At the beginning of the film the children were receiving medals from Hitler for their bravery. When the kids were manning an AA gun, a parent came up and told them to leave because they would die, and they would have none of it. They were prepared to die for Hitler. Towards the end of the movie when the defenses were failing one of he children, a young girl, asked another older kid to kill her, and he did. He then turned the gun on himself. This scene was done without words and was again very intense and outstanding. I could go on and on and get into some of the political philosophies of this movie and what they mean but I wont. This is an amazing movie and IF you can handle the fact that by the end of the movie, you may question your beliefs of what Hitler was, a man not a monster, then you should watch this movie, if you can't then stay away. Because this movie gives a convincing argument that not all evil men are heartless monsters, but human beings with a belief that what they are doing is right. *This review and others can be seen at www.bbmc.dockratent.com*"
"I saw the movie last week in an overcrowded cinema and was surprised about the outstanding actors (Bruno Ganz and Corinna Harfouch) , the perfect screenplay (Bernd Eichinger) and the work of director Oliver Hirschbiegel.What happened on the screen gave the closest insight into the darkest part of German history and the darkest corners of human nature.The movie shows the human being Hitler as that monster and mad man he was. And no one else as he himself destroys and demystifies his 'legend'. Based strictly on historical facts and dialogs the movie shows, why The Downfall (Der Untergang) had to happen.One of the most harrowing scene is, when Magda Goebels kills her six children cold blooded. The camera does not turn away and shows the details of cruelty to make clear, what this kind of blind fanaticism leads to. Many scenes are really hard to bear but they are necessary to tell the story.There are many discussions around the world right now and many ask, if Hitler should be shown as a human being and if Germany should look back on its past that way. I am convinced, that after you have seen the movie, the answer will be yes. The characters on the screen are no role models for Nazis of today. No one of the perpetrators become victims. The screenplay describes but it never explains. What happens on the screen explains itself. I am sure 'The Downfall' is of international interest and will be an international success. A must to see.Greetings from Dirk, Munich, Germany"
"This is one of the most amazing films I have ever seen. Although ostensibly the film deals with the decline, fall and suicide of Adolf Hitler, it's about much more than that. Indeed, Hitler's suicide occurs at about two thirds to three quarters of the way through the film, with the remainder concerned with the downfall (and perhaps redemption) of other characters.I thought Bruno Ganz, who played Hitler, was terrific. Aside from the occasional hand movement which I thought bordered on parody, I really got a sense of a complete individual from his characterization. Those moments of tenderness and personality that are often shown, particularly when Hitler was in Bavaria. Those moments of rage and hysteria, evident in the stadium-style documentary footage of Hitler's speech-making. But there are other elements too... the shaking of his hand, for example, which I thought was meant to suggest Hitler had Parkinson's Disease and the matter of fact way in which he described how to commit a ""successful suicide"". I thought Ganz portrayed both the sanity and insanity of Hitler effectively.People are constantly dying in this film, at their own hands or at the hands of others. I know this sounds odd, but after a while the death, destruction and suicide become the norm. I'm not saying it becomes acceptable, but I think through repetition, one is really given a sense of what it must have been like to have been there at the end. In contrast to the well known footage of Hitler making speeches in stadiums, it's a shambles. The army can't fight anymore. A time when half the soldiers are either drunk, deserting Hitler, or committing suicide. A time when life, seemingly, had little value, where death didn't seem to matter.Perhaps the most distressing of the deaths, however, are those of Goebbels' children, as we're shown their mother giving them their lethal dose of something or other. Cyanide? But it's not gratuitous, their portrayal has a purpose. It, perhaps, gives an insight into why people were there until the very end... why Hitler commanded whatever he did even after his death. What is it that would allow someone to kill their own children for an ideal? Or was it because there was, seemingly, no other option? The film doesn't answer these questions, it just poses them.Some of the reviews have described the film as sympathetic towards Hitler. Yes, Hitler is described as a character with more than one dimension, but it could hardly be described as sympathetic as he declares that, despite everything, he was proud of the Jewish slaughter. He also declares the remainder of the German people were idiots and weak. And Goebbels, I think it was, declares the people deserving of everything they got when asked to consider the need to protect the civilians because ""they chose their destiny"".As for other central characters? Eva Braun comes across as a total idiot, totally unfeeling, except for the farewell letter she writes to her sister... but even then it's full of trivialities. This is not really a film, though, about Hitler, or even the people like Goebbels, Himler and Braun, it's about the people on the fringes around him and I think many reviews have missed the point about who the central character of the film actually is.As it turns out, the central character is actually a young secretary employed by Hitler two and a half years before the end of the war. A young woman who probably falls in love with Hitler and who is, seemingly, chosen because of her beauty and not her skills as a stenographer or typist. Much of the plot line is about how she deals with the realization of what is occurring around her.Another central character is a young Aryan-boy... blonde, blue eyes... who fights the war on Hitler's behalf as a member of Hitler Youth... but who also, somehow, survives which in some ways was a little distressing. Six million Jews died, but the young Aryan boy survives. A point to ponder.For me, however, the most distressing part of the movie was the end which features the stock-standard ""what happened to"" feature of so many historical dramas. It amazed me that so many people had lived so long with the memories of the war and of the events portrayed in the film. And then, just when you think, that's about it, one of the central characters, the young secretary, is shown in documentary footage in her 70s or 80s, reflecting on her life. She tells the story of how, throughout the Nuremberg Trials, she was surprised at the extent of the Jewish extermination. And then, in a truly remarkable moment, she mentions how, in a moment of self-revelation, she recognized she could have known more, she, perhaps could have done something.As such, this is a really important movie for just about everyone to see."
"I cannot believe that this movie did not win the Oscar for best foreign language film. I really cannot believe that another movie could take the Oscar. Perhaps politics is the cause of that, I do not know but this movie is the best movie I have seen for many years and I have seen a lot of them.This movie is a ""must see"" movie for everyone. Bruno Ganz is just incredible as Hitler.The movie is about the last days of Adolf Hitler before he kills himself. The portrait of Hitler as part a very carrying man and part of this monster we know he was is done really really good. This movie really deserve the 10 stars!"
"Not since the 1981 release of ""Das Boot"" has a German film had such an impact on audiences witnessing, from a German point of view, the perception, judgement,interpretation and opinion on its own history. ""Downfall"" tells the true story of the last days of the third Reich (April 1945), from within Hitlers secret underground bunker situated in the heart of Berlin. 3/4 of the film is set inside the scope of the claustrophobic and confined concrete bunker world of Adolf Hitler during his last weeks alive. The film also show a glimpse of central Berlin in its besieged and confused state during the Soviet onslaught. Inside the bunker we see Hitler's decay, he goes from calmness to rage, from understanding to paranoia, from irrational to total deluded. He gives his generals and field commandos ( there was no grand admirals present in the bunker at this time of the war) orders that are not compatible with reality or fact. He tries to control armies that do not exist anymore or order companies to counter-attack that only featuring on a map. A large majority of his high ranking commanding officers sense, and have done for 8-months, the war is lost on the side of Germany. However, some still believe in final victory in idealistic faculties. This is played out on screen with nervous tension. In addition, the few scenes set outside the bunker bring across a population confused, scarred, exhausted. Some however are continuing to display courage in valiantly defending the city and show continuously hopeless resistance in the face of the advancing red army (1st Belarussian army)bought on by years of Nazi propaganda.The film magnificently achieves to bring to screen the combination of Traudi Junges ( Hitlers private secretary) memoirs, Nazi officials memoirs, German war archives and the documentary ""blind spot"" to a conclusion on screen.Bruno Ganz brings the fuhrer to life in his exceptionally good performance. Alexandria Maria Lara plays the role of Traudi Junge has a young confused,aroused and obsolete to the truth citizen of the third Reich. All the members of the cast gives excellently rehearsed and researched performances to life. Ulrich Noether was a perfect likeness to Himmler.""Downfall"" is a remarkable history lesson on the second world war in Europe. It holds the attention of the audience through out. The film never side tracking away for long enough, in which it sets the sense of calmness, peace and normality, to lose sight of the unbearable reality of the situation."
